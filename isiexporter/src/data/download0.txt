After such assembly, the host organism's genome is inactivated or ablated to permit full control of host cellular functions by the replacement genome. A modular replacement genome comprises an assembly of nucleic acid fragments, or segments, derived from one or more natural organisms or from synthetic polynucleotides or from a combination of both. Such an assembly, or set, of segments making up a replacement genome comprises a substantially complete set of genes and regulatory elements for carrying out minimal life functions under predefined culture conditions.
