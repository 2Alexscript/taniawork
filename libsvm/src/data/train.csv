PURPOSE: Colistin is increasingly used as the last-resort treatment option against infections caused by multidrug-resistant  MDR  Gram-negative pathogens  but its nephrotoxicity is of concern  especially in severely ill patients  The aim of this study was to analyze the toxicity of colistin therapy in adults and children with hematological malignancies  HM  and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  recipients  METHODS: Data on HSCT recipients and HM patients  treated with intravenous colistin  2 5-5ÿmg kg day in children and 3-6 million international units  IU  in adults  adjusted to renal function  during the period 2008-2011 in our center  were retrospectively collected and analyzed  Nephrotoxicity was defined according to the RIFLE criteria  Risk  Injury  Failure  Loss  and End-stage kidney disease   RESULTS: Twenty-nine children and adults received 38 courses of intravenous colistin  2 5-5ÿmg kg day in children and 3-6ÿ?ÿ10 6 ÿIU in adults  adjusted to renal function  [allogeneic HSCT  22 courses  and HM  16 courses ] for 3-28 days  median 10 days  for empirical therapy for nosocomial clinical sepsis  28  or local infection  6   and bacteremia with MDR Gram-negative rods  4   Nephrotoxicity was observed at the end of 4  10 5ÿ   courses  In 32  84ÿ   courses  nephrotoxic medications were concomitantly administered  Two patients had convulsions  probably unrelated to colistin  Seven patients  18ÿ   died while on colistin therapy  No death was attributed to an adverse effect of colistin  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with intravenous colistin  with dosage adjusted to renal function  was relatively safe for HM HSCT patients  even with concomitantly administered nephrotoxic medications  Concern about nephrotoxicity should not justify a delay in initiating empirical colistin treatment in situations where infection with MDR Gram-negative rods is likely ,1
We analyzed outcome of a population-based cohort of 74 children with second and third acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  relapse and aimed to identify prognostic factors  Duration of previous remission and site of relapse appeared of prognostic relevance as patients with a second remission duration  1 5 years and isolated extramedullary relapse did better  Neither patient with a second bone marrow relapse who underwent previous allogeneic transplantation nor patients with T-cell ALL survived  Overall  7 of 74  9   patients are in long-term remission  Stem cell transplantation seemed to be the only curative option for systemic relapse of B-cell precursor ALL as all 4 surviving patients with a second third relapse involving the bone marrow received a transplant  Conclusively  patients with a second ALL relapse are ideal candidates for phase I II trials exploring new innovative drugs ,1
Although macrophage activation syndrome  MAS  develops in some patients with chronic granulomatous disease  CGD   all of the reported cases have been associated with pathogenic microbial infections  We report a 2-year-old boy with CGD-associated colitis who suffered from MAS without any clinical signs of a microbial infection  He was treated with 1 course of methylprednisolone pulse therapy and the clinical symptoms improved; however  the colitis was difficult to control even with immunosuppressive drugs  and he eventually required hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 1 year after the onset of MAS  It is likely that MAS develops in patients with CGD colitis independent of microbial infections ,1
Natural killer  NK  T-cell lymphomas and NK-cell leukemias are aggressive malignancies  Occurring worldwide  they show a predilection for Asian and South American populations  Neoplastic cells are surface-CD3-  cytoplasmic-CD3 +  CD56+  cytotoxic molecules+  Epstein-Barr virus  EBV +  with germline T-cell receptor gene  Lymphomas occur most commonly in the nasal and upper aerodigestive region  Occasional cases present primarily in the skin  salivary gland  testis and gastrointestinal tract  Rare cases are disseminated with lymphadenopathy  hepatosplenomegaly and a leukemic phase  Positron emission tomography computed tomography is useful in staging  as lymphomas are 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid  Quantification of circulating EBV DNA is an accurate surrogate biomarker of tumor load  Nasal NK T-cell lymphomas present mostly with stage I II disease  Concomitant sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the standard treatment  Radiotherapy alone is inadequate because of high systemic failure rate  For stage III IV nasal  non-nasal and disseminated lymphomas  systemic chemotherapy is indicated  Regimens containing L-asparaginase and drugs unaffected by P-glycoprotein are most effective  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  is not indicated for early-staged nasal lymphomas  HSCT for lymphomas not in remission has poor results  In advanced-staged nasal  non-nasal  disseminated or relapsed lymphomas  HSCT may be considered when remission is achieved  Prognostic modeling and EBV DNA monitoring may be useful in risk-stratification for HSCT ,1
Steroid refractory gastrointestinal  GI  acute graft versus host disease  aGVHD  is a major cause of mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HCT  without immune markers to establish a diagnosis or guide therapy  We found that T cell receptor    TCR   CDR3 repertoire sequencing reveals patterns that could eventually serve as a disease biomarker of T cell alloreactivity in aGVHD  We identified T cell clones in GI biopsies in a heterogeneous group of 15 allogeneic HCT patients with GI aGVHD symptoms  Seven steroid-refractory aGVHD patients showed a more conserved TCR  clonal structure between different biopsy sites in the GI tract than eight primary-therapy responsive patients  Tracking GI clones identified at endoscopy longitudinally in the blood also revealed an increased clonal expansion in patients with steroid-refractory disease  Immune repertoire sequencing-based methods could enable a novel personalized way to guide diagnosis and therapy in diseases where T cell activity is a major determinant ,1
BACKGROUND: Cell transplantation of human cord blood mononuclear progenitor cells  HCBMCs  is a new treatment that could restore cardiac functions after acute myocardial infarction  AMI   We hypothesize that multiple doses of HCBMCs might increase homing of transplanted cells to infarcted region  and improve outcome of AMI via inhibition of ischemic-induced inflammatory responses  METHODS AND RESULTS: HCBMCs were injected intravenously to rabbits that previously underwent ligation of left anterior coronary artery  LAD   Single dose of HCBMCs was intravenously delivered on the 7th day or multiple doses of HCBMCs were delivered on the 7th  9th  11th and 13th day after AMI  Homing of HCBMCs was determined by 5-bromodeoxyuridine  BrdU  labeling  The amount of grafted cells homed and retained in the infarcted area was significantly increased in the rabbits that received multiple doses  More viable cardiomyocytes and less collagen deposition were observed also in the group with more injections  Cardiac functions were assessed by echocardiography and hemodynamics  Multiple doses of HCBMCs showed significant benefits in preservation of cardiac functions  In infarcted myocardium  multiple transplantations of HCBMCs showed a significant increase in the myocardial level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and a marked decrease in the level of the pro-inflammatory IL-6  CONCLUSIONS: Multiple injections of HCBMCs markedly increased the amount of grafted cells  beneficially improving cardiac functions after AMI  The findings suggest that multiple doses of HCBMCs might be a novel strategy in the cell therapy for AMI ,0
BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed improvement in heart function by injecting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  BMSCs  after AMI  Emerging evidence suggested that both the number and function of BMSCs decline with ageing  We designed a randomized  controlled trial to further investigate the safety and efficacy of this treatment  METHODS: Patients with ST-elevation AMI undergoing successful reperfusion treatment within 12hours were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary infusion of BMSCs  n=21  or standard medical treatment  n=22   the numbers of patients were limited because of the complication of coronary artery obstruction   RESULTS: There is a closely positive correlation of the number and function of BMSCs vs  the cardiac function reflected by LVEF at baseline  r=0 679  P=0 001  and at 12-month follow-up  r=0 477  P=0 039   Six months after cell administration  myocardial viability within the infarct area by 18-FDG SPECT was improved in both groups compared with baseline  but no significant difference in the BMSCs compared with control groups  4 0ñ0 4  95 CI 3 1-4 9 vs  3 2ñ0 5  95 CI 2 1-4 3  P=0 237   99mTc-sestamibi SPECT demonstrated that myocardial perfusion within the infarct area in the BMSCs did not differ from the control group  4 4ñ0 5  95 CI 3 2-5 5 vs  3 9ñ0 6  95 CI 2 6-5 2  P=0 594   Similarly  LVEF after 12 and 24months follow-up did not show any difference between the two groups  In the BMSCs group  one patient suffered a serious complication of coronary artery occlusion during the BMSCs injection procedure  CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefits of intracoronary injection of autologous BMSCs in acute STEMI patients need further investigation and reevaluation ,0
Donor-specific immunological tolerance using high doses of bone marrow cells  BMCs  has been demonstrated in mixed chimerism-based tolerance induction protocols; however  the development of graft versus host disease remains a risk  Here  we demonstrate that the co-infusion of limited numbers of donor unfractionated BMCs with human amnion-derived multipotent progenitor cells  AMPs  7 days post-allograft transplantation facilitates macrochimerism induction and graft tolerance in a mouse skin transplantation model  AMPs + BMCs co-infusion with minimal conditioning led to stable  mixed  multilineage lymphoid and myeloid macrochimerism  deletion of donor-reactive T cells  expansion of CD4 +  CD25 +  Foxp3 +  regulatory T cells  Tregs   and long-term allograft survival   300 days   Based on these findings  we speculate that AMPs maybe a pro-tolerogenic cellular therapeutic that could have clinical efficacy for both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant applications ,0
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  is an established treatment for multiple myeloma  MM   a plasma cell malignancy  In order to identify an improved pre-transplant conditioning regimen  we investigated the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine  Gem  and clofarabine  Clo  combinations toward MM cell lines and patient cell samples  A strong synergism of the two nucleoside analogs  when combined at their  IC10 concentrations  was observed  This synergism may be partly due to the observed Gem-mediated phosphorylation and activation of deoxycytidine kinase  resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Gem and Clo  Their cytotoxicity correlated with a robust activation of the DNA damage response pathway  [Gem+Clo] decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential with a concomitant release of pro-apoptotic factors into the cytoplasm and nucleus  and activation of apoptosis  Exposure of MM cells to [Gem+Clo] also decreased the level of ribosomal RNA  rRNA   which might have resulted in nucleolar stress  as reported previously  and caused a p53-dependent cell death  A reduction  by  50   in the cytotoxicity of Gem and Clo was observed in the presence of pifithrin    a p53 inhibitor  Furthermore  MM cell lines with mutant p53 exhibited greater resistance to Gem and Clo  supporting a role for the p53 protein in these cytotoxic responses  Our results provide a rationale for clinical trials incorporating [Gem+Clo] combinations as part of conditioning therapy for high-risk MM patients undergoing HSCT ,0
This study assessed the effect of KCNMA1 transfected bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells  BM-MSCs  on the improvement of erectile function in diabetic rats  Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin  STZ  and screened with apomorphine  APO  to establish diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction  DMED   DMED rats were randomly divided into four groups: rats in each group underwent intracavernous injection with either phosphate buffer solution  DMED+PBS   nontransfected MSCs  DMED+MSCs   empty vector transfected MSCs  DMED+null-MSCs  or KCNMA1 transfected MSCs  DMED+KCNMA1-MSCs   Before injection  high levels of KCNMA1 expression were confirmed in KCNMA1-MSCs using RT-PCR and Western blotting  The lentivirus transfected MSCs maintained their potential for multidirectional differentiation  Four weeks after injection  erectile function was ascertained by measuring intracavernous pressure  ICP   Penile tissues were collected for immunohistochemical analysis  The expression of KCNMA1 in the corpus cavernosum was increased  and the DMED+KCNMA1-MSCs group displayed a significant improvement of erectile function  We concluded that KCNMA1 was able to enhance the positive effect of MSCs in the treatment of diabetes-associated erectile dysfunction ,0
