<lb/>respected be their remains, and immortalized their
<lb/>virtues! may time, while it moulders their frail relics
<lb/>to dust, commit to tradition the record of their good
<lb/>ness! and oh may their orphan-descendant be influ
<lb/>enced through life by the remembrance of their purity,
<lb/>and in death be solaced, that by her it was unsullied!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Such was the secret prayer with which the only sur
<lb/>vivor of the Beverley family quitted the abode of her
<lb/>youth, and residence of her fore-fathers; while tears of
<lb/>recollecting sorrow filled her eyes, and obstructed the
<lb/>last view of her native town which had excited them.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, this fair traveller, had lately entered into
<lb/>the one-and-twentieth year of her age.  Her ances
	  <lb/>tors had been rich farmers in the county of <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>,
<lb/>though her father, in whom a spirit of elegance had
<lb/>supplanted the rapacity of wealth, had spent his time
<lb/>as a private country gentleman, satisfied, without in
<lb/>creasing his store, to live upon what he inherited from

<lb/>the labours of his predecessors.  She had lost him in
<lb/>her early youth, and her mother had not long sur
<lb/>vived him.  They had bequeathed to her 10,000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. and
<lb/>consigned her to the care of the Dean of , her
<lb/>uncle.  With this gentleman, in whom, by various
<lb/>contingencies, the accumulated possessions of a rising
<lb/>and prosperous family were centred, she had passed
<lb/>the last four years of her life; and a few weeks only
<lb/>had yet elapsed since his death, which, by depriving
<lb/>her of her last relation, made her heiress to an estate
<lb/>of 3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. per annum; with no other restriction than
<lb/>that of annexing her name, if she married, to the dis
<lb/>posal of her hand and riches.</p>
<p><lb/>But though thus largely indebted to fortune, to
<lb/>nature she had yet greater obligations:  her form was
<lb/>elegant, her heart was liberal; her countenance an
<lb/>nounced the intelligence of her mind, her complexion
<lb/>varied with every emotion of her soul, and her eyes,
<lb/>the heralds of her speech, now beamed with under
<lb/>standing, and now glistened with sensibility.</p>
<p><lb/>For the short period of her minority, the manage
<lb/>ment of her fortune, and the care of her person, had
<lb/>been entrusted by the Dean to three guardians, among
<lb/>whom her own choice was to settle her residence:
<lb/>but her mind, saddened by the loss of all her natural
<lb/>friends, coveted to regain its serenity in the quietness
<lb/>of the country, and in the bosom of an aged and ma
<lb/>ternal counsellor, whom she loved as her mother, and
<lb/>to whom she had been known from her childhood.</p>
<p><lb/>The Deanery, indeed, she was obliged to relin
<lb/>quish, a long repining expectant being eager by en
<lb/>tering it, to bequeath to another the anxiety and
<lb/>suspense he had suffered himself, though probably
<pb n="003"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">7</mw>
<lb/>without much impatience to shorten their duration in
	  <lb/>favour of the next successor; but the house of <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Charlton</persName>, her benevolent friend, was open for her re
<lb/>ception, and the alleviating tenderness of her conver
<lb/>sation took from her all wish of changing it.</p>
<p><lb/>Here she had dwelt since the interment of her
<lb/>uncle; and here, from the affectionate gratitude of
<lb/>her disposition, she had perhaps been content to dwell
<lb/>till her own, had not her guardians interfered to re
<lb/>move her.</p>
<p><lb/>Reluctantly she complied; she quitted her early
<lb/>companions, the friend she most revered, and the spot
<lb/>which contained the relicks of all she had yet lived to
<lb/>lament; and, accompanied by one of her guardians,
<lb/>and attended by two servants, she began her journey
	  <lb/>from <placeName>Bury</placeName> to <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, this gentleman, though in the prime of
<lb/>his life, though gay, fashionable and splendid, had been
<lb/>appointed by her uncle to be one of her trustees; a
<lb/>choice which had for object the peculiar gratification
	  <lb/>of his niece, whose most favourite young friend <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel</persName> had married, and in whose house he therefore
<lb/>knew she would most wish to live.</p>
<p><lb/>Whatever good-nature could dictate or politeness
	  <lb/>suggest to dispel her melancholy, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> failed
	  <lb/>not to urge; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in whose disposition sweet
<lb/>ness was tempered with dignity, and gentleness with
<lb/>fortitude, suffered not his kind offices to seem ineffec
<lb/>tual; she kissed her hand at the last glimpse a friendly
<lb/>hill afforded of her native town, and made an effort to
<lb/>forget the regret with which she lost sight of it.  She
<lb/>revived her spirits by plans of future happiness, dwelt
<lb/>upon the delight with which she should meet her

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">8</mw>
<lb/>young friend, and, by accepting his consolation, amply
<lb/>rewarded his trouble.</p>
<p><lb/>Her serenity, however, had yet another, though
<lb/>milder trial to undergo, since another friend was yet
<lb/>to be met, and another farewel was yet to be taken.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>At the distance of seven miles from <placeName>Bury</placeName> resided
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, the richest and most powerful man in
	  <lb/>that neighbourhood, at whose house <persName>Cecilia</persName> and her
<lb/>guardian were invited to breakfast in their journey.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who was the younger son of a
<lb/>noble family, was a man of parts, information and sa
<lb/>gacity; to great native strength of mind he added a
<lb/>penetrating knowledge of the world, and to faculties
<lb/>the most skilful of investigating the character of
<lb/>every other, a dissimulation the most profound in
<lb/>concealing his own.  In the bloom of his youth, im
<lb/>patient for wealth and ambitious of power, he had
<lb/>tied himself to a rich dowager of quality, whose age,
<lb/>though sixty-seven, was but among the smaller spe
<lb/>cies of her evil properties, her disposition being far
<lb/>more repulsive than her wrinkles.  An inequality of
<lb/>years so considerable, had led him to expect that the
<lb/>fortune he thus acquired, would speedily be re
<lb/>leased from the burthen with which it was at present
<lb/>incumbered; but his expectations proved as vain as
<lb/>they were mercenary, and his lady was not more the
<lb/>dupe of his protestations, than he was himself of his
<lb/>own purposes.  Ten years he had been married to
<lb/>her, yet her health was good, and her faculties were
<lb/>unimpaired; eagerly he had watched for her dissolu
<lb/>tion, yet his eagerness had injured no health but his
<lb/>own!  So short-sighted is selfish cunning, that in
<lb/>aiming no further than at the gratification of the

<lb/>present moment, it obscures the evils of the future,
<lb/>while it impedes the perception of integrity and
<lb/>honour.</p>
<p>His ardour, however, to attain the blest period of
<lb/>returning liberty, deprived him neither of spirit nor
<lb/>inclination for intermediate enjoyment; he knew the
<lb/>world too well to incur its censure by ill-treating the
<lb/>woman to whom he was indebted for the rank he held
<lb/>in it; he saw her, indeed, but seldom, yet he had the
<lb/>decency, alike in avoiding as in meeting her, to show
<lb/>no abatement of civility and good-breeding:  but,
<lb/>having thus sacrificed to ambition all possibility of
<lb/>happiness in domestic life, he turned his thoughts to
<lb/>those other methods of procuring it, which he had so
<lb/>dearly purchased the power of essaying.</p>
<p>The resources of pleasure to the possessors of
<lb/>wealth are only to be cut off by the satiety of which
<lb/>they are productive:  a satiety which the vigorous
	  <lb/>mind of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had not yet suffered him to
<lb/>experience; his time, therefore, was either devoted
<lb/>to the expensive amusements of the metropolis, or
<lb/>spent in the country among the gayest of its diver
<lb/>sions.</p>
<p><lb/>The little knowledge of fashionable manners and
	  <lb/>of the characters of the times of which <persName>Cecilia</persName> was yet
<lb/>mistress, she had gathered at the house of this gen
<lb/>tleman, with whom the Dean her Uncle had been inti
<lb/>mately connected:  for as he preserved to the world
<lb/>the same appearance of decency he supported to his
<lb/>wife, he was every where well received, and being but
<lb/>partially known, was extremely respected:  the world,
<lb/>with its wonted facility, repaying his circumspect at
<lb/>tention to its laws, by silencing the voice of censure,
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">B</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="B1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">10</mw>
<lb/>guarding his character from impeachment, and his
<lb/>name from reproach.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> had been known to him half her life; she
<lb/>had been caressed in his house as a beautiful child,
<lb/>and her presence was now solicited there as an amia
<lb/>ble aquaintance.  Her visits, indeed, had by no
	  <lb/>means been frequent, as the ill-humour of <persName>Lady Mar
<lb/>garet Monckton</persName> had rendered them painful to her:
<lb/>yet the opportunities they had afforded her of mixing
<lb/>with people of fashion, had served to prepare her for
<lb/>the new scenes in which she was soon to be a per
<lb/>former.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, in return, had always been a wel
<lb/>come guest at the Deanery; his conversation was to
<lb/>Cecilia a never-failing source of information, as his
<lb/>knowledge of life and manners enabled him to start
<lb/>those subjects of which she was most ignorant; and
<lb/>her mind, copius for the admission, and intelligent
<lb/>for the arrangement of knowledge, received all new
<lb/>ideas with avidity.</p>
<p><lb/>Pleasure given in Society, like money lent in usury,
<lb/>returns with interest to those who dispense it:  and
	  <lb/>the discourse of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> conferred not a greater
	  <lb/>favour upon <persName>Cecilia</persName> than her attention to it repaid.
<lb/>And thus, the speaker and the hearer being mutually
<lb/>gratified, they had always met with complacency, and
<lb/>commonly parted with regret.</p>
<p><lb/>This reciprocation of pleasure had, however, pro
<lb/>duced different effects upon their minds; the ideas of
	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> were enlarged, while the reflections of <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Monckton</persName> were embittered.  He here saw an object,
<lb/>who to all the advantages of that wealth he had so
<lb/>highly prized, added youth, beauty, and intelligence;
<pb n="009"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">11</mw>
<lb/>though much her senior, he was by no means of an
<lb/>age to render his addressing her an impropriety,
<lb/>and the entertainment she received from his conver
<lb/>sation, persuaded him that her good opinion might
<lb/>with ease be improved into a regard the most partial.
<lb/>He regretted the venal rapacity with which he had sa
<lb/>crificed himself to a woman he abhorred, and his
<lb/>wishes for her final decay became daily more fervent.
	  <lb/>He knew that the acquaintance of <persName>Cecilia</persName> was con
<lb/>fined to a circle of which he was himself the principal
<lb/>ornament, that she had rejected all the proposals of
<lb/>marriage which had hitherto been made to her, and,
<lb/>as he had sedulously watched her from her earliest
<lb/>years, he had reason to believe that her heart had
<lb/>escaped any dangerous impression.  This being her
<lb/>situation, he had long looked upon her as his future
<lb/>property; as such he had indulged his admira
<lb/>tion, and as such he had already appropriated her
<lb/>estate, though he had not more vigilantly inspected
<lb/>into her sentiments, than he had guarded his own
<lb/>from a similar scrutiny.</p>
<p><lb/>The death of the Dean had, indeed, much alarmed
	  <lb/>him; he grieved at her leaving <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, where he
<lb/>considered himself the first man, alike in parts and in
	  <lb/>consequence, and he dreaded her residing in <placeName>London</placeName>,
<lb/>where he foresaw that numerous rivals, equal to him
<lb/>self in talents and riches, would speedily surround
<lb/>her; rivals, too, youthful and sanguine, not shackled
<lb/>by present ties, but at liberty to solicit her immediate
<lb/>acceptance.  Beauty and independence, rarely found
<lb/>together, would attract a crowd of suitors at once
	  <lb/>brilliant and assiduous; and the house of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb/>was eminent for its elegance and gaiety; but yet,
<pb n="010"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">12</mw>
<lb/>undaunted by danger, and confiding in his own
<lb/>powers, he determined to pursue the project he had
<lb/>formed, not fearing by address and perseverance to
<lb/>ensure its success.</p></div>

	<p><persName><hi rend="case(allcaps)">Mr.</hi> Monckton</persName> had, at this time, a party of com
<lb/>pany assembled at his house for the purpose of spend
<lb/>ing the Christmas holidays.  He waited with anxiety
	  <lb/>the arrival of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and flew to hand her from th<sic corr="e"></sic>
	  <lb/>chaise before <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> could alight.  He observed
<lb/>the melancholy of her countenance, and was much

	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, perceiving her aversion, though ignorant of
<lb/>its cause, took care to avoid all intercourse with her
<lb/>but what ceremony exacted, and pitied in secret the
<lb/>unfortunate lot of her friend.</p>
<p><lb/>The company now present consisted of one lady
<lb/>and several gentlemen.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Miss Bennet</persName>, the Lady, was in every sense of the
	  <lb/>phrase, the humble companion of <persName>Lady Margaret</persName>;
<lb/>she was low-born, meanly educated, and narrow
<lb/>minded; a stranger alike to innate merit or acquired
<lb/>accomplishments, yet skilful in the art of flattery,
<lb/>and an adept in every species of low cunning.  With
<lb/>no other view in life than the attainment of affluence
<lb/>without labour, she was not more the slave of the mis
<lb/>tress of the house, than the tool of its master; re
<lb/>ceiving indignity without murmur, and submitting to
<lb/>contempt as a thing of course.</p>
<p><lb/>Among the gentlemen, the most conspicious, by
	  <lb/>means of his dress, was <persName>Mr. Aresby</persName>, a captain in the
<lb/>militia; a young man who, having frequently heard
<lb/>the words red-coat and gallantry put together, ima
<lb/>gined the conjunction not merely customary, but ho
<lb/>nourable, and therefore, without even pretending to
<lb/>think of the service of his country, he considered a
<lb/>cockade as a badge of politeness, and wore it but to
<lb/>mark his devotion to the ladies, whom he held him
<lb/>self equipped to conquer, and bound to adore.</p>
<p><lb/>The next, who by forwardness the most officious,
	  <lb/>took care to be noticed, was <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, a young
<lb/>lawyer, who, though rising in his profession, owed
<lb/>his success neither to distinguished abilities, nor to
<lb/>skill-supplying industry, but to the art of uniting
<lb/>suppleness to others with confidence in himself.  To
<pb n="014"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">14</mw>
<lb/>a reverence of rank, talents, and fortune the most
<lb/>profound, he joined an assurance in his own merit,
<lb/>which no superiority could depress; and with a pre
<lb/>sumption which encouraged him to aim at all things,
<lb/>he blended a good-humour that no mortification
<lb/>could lessen.  And while by the pliability of his
<lb/>disposition he avoided making enemies, by his readi
<lb/>ness to oblige, he learned the surest way of making
<lb/>friends, by becoming useful to them.</p>
<p><lb/>There were also some neighbouring squires; and
<lb/>there was one old gentleman, who, without seeming
<lb/>to notice any of the company, sat frowning in a
<lb/>corner.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>But the principal figure in the circle was <persName>Mr. Bel
<lb/>field</persName>, a tall, thin young man, whose face was all ani
<lb/>mation, and whose eyes sparkled with intelligence.
<lb/>He had been intended by his father for trade, but his
<lb/>spirit, soaring above the occupation for which he was
<lb/>designed, from repining led him to resist, and from
<lb/>resisting, to rebel.  He eloped from his friends, and
<lb/>contrived to enter the army.  But, fond of the polite
<lb/>arts, and eager for the acquirement of knowledge, he
<lb/>found not this way of life much better adapted to
<lb/>his inclination than that from which he had escaped;
<lb/>he soon grew weary of it, was reconciled to his fa
<lb/>ther, and entered at the Temple.  But here, too vo
<lb/>latile for serious study, and too gay for laborious ap
<lb/>plication, he made little progress:  and the same
<lb/>quickness of parts and vigour of imagination which,
<lb/>united with prudence or accompanied by judgment,
<lb/>might have raised him to the head of his profession,
<lb/>being unhappily associated with fickleness and caprice,
<lb/>served only to impede his improvement, and obstruct
<pb n="015"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B5r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">15</mw>
<lb/>his preferment.  And now, with little business, and
<lb/>that little neglected, a small fortune, and that fortune
<lb/>daily becoming less, the admiration of the world, but
<lb/>that admiration ending simply in civility, he lived an
<lb/>unsettled and unprofitable life, generally caressed,
<lb/>and universally sought, yet careless of his interest,
<lb/>and thoughtless of the future; devoting his time to
<lb/>company, his income to dissipation, and his heart to
<lb/>the Muses.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q001" next="q002">I bring you,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, as he attend
	  <lb/>ed <persName>Cecilia</persName> into the room, <q id="q002" prev="q001">a subject of sorrow in a
<lb/>young lady who never gave disturbance to her
<lb/>friends but in quitting them.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q003" next="q004">If sorrow,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, darting upon

<lb/>it for a view of joy?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>She's divinely handsome, indeed!</q> cried the
<lb/>captain, affecting an involuntary exclamation.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>Mean time, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was placed next to the
	  <lb/>lady of the house, quietly began her breakfast; <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Morrice</persName>, the young lawyer, with the most easy free
	  <lb/>dom, seating himself at her side, while <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>
<lb/>was elsewhere arranging the rest of his guests, in
<lb/>order to secure that place for himself.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, without ceremony, attacked his fair
<lb/>neighbour; he talked of her journey, and the pros
<lb/>pects of gaiety which it opened to her view; but by
<lb/>these finding her unmoved, he changed his theme,
<lb/>and expatiated upon the delights of the spot she was
<lb/>quitting.  Studious to recommend himself to her
<lb/>notice, and indifferent by what means, one moment he
<lb/>flippantly extolled the entertainments of the town,
<pb n="016"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="B5v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">16</mw>
<lb/>and the next, rapturously described the charms of
<lb/>the country.  A word, a look, sufficed to mark her
<lb/>approbation or dissent, which he no sooner discovered,
<lb/>that he slided into her opinion, with as much faci
<lb/>lity and satisfaction as if it had originally been his
<lb/>own.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, suppressing his chagrin, waited
<lb/>some time in expectation that when this young man
<lb/>saw he was standing, he would yield to him his chair:
<lb/>but the remark was not made, and the resignation
<lb/>was not thought of.  The captain, too, regarding
<lb/>the lady as his natural property for the morning,
<lb/>perceived with indignation by whom he was sup
<lb/>planted; while the company in general saw, with
<lb/>much surprize, the place they had severally forborne
<lb/>to occupy from respect to their host, thus familiarly
<lb/>seized upon by the man who, in the whole room,
<lb/>had the least claim, either from age or rank, to con
<lb/>sult nothing but his own inclination.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, however, when he found that deli
<lb/>cacy and good-manners had no weight with his
<lb/>guest, thought it most expedient to allow them none
<lb/>with himself; and therefore, dis
<lb/>guising his displeasure under a guise of facetiousness, he
	  <lb/>called out, <q>Come, <persName>Morrice</persName>, you that love Christ
<lb/>mas sports, what say you to the game of move
<lb/>all?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>I like it of all things!</q> answered <persName>Morrice</persName>, and

<q id="q020" prev="q019" next="q021">if he has

<p>	  <lb/><q id="q022" next="q023">Deviations from common rules,</q> said <persName>Mr.

	    <lb/>merely pardonable, but admirable; and you, <persName>Belfield</persName>,
<lb/>have a peculiar right to plead their merits; but so

<p>	  <lb/><q id="q026" next="q027">All this,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, <q id="q027" prev="q026">is but the
<lb/>doctrine of a lively imagination, that looks upon im
<lb/>possibilities simply as difficulties, and upon difficulties
<lb/>as mere invitations to victory.  But experience
<lb/>teaches another lesson; experience shews that the op
<lb/>position of an individual to a community is always
<lb/>dangerous in the operation, and seldom successful in
<lb/>the event;never, indeed, without a concurrence,
<lb/>strange as desirable, of fortunate circumstances with
<lb/>great abilities.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q028" next="q029">And why is this,</q> returned <persName>Belfield</persName>, <q id="q029" prev="q028">but be
<lb/>cause the attempt is so seldom made?  The pitiful
<lb/>prevalence of general conformity extirpates genius,
<lb/>and murders originality; man is brought up, not as
<lb/>if he were <q>the noblest work of God,</q> but as a
<lb/>mere ductile machine of human formation:  he is
<lb/>early taught that he must neither consult his under
<lb/>standing, nor pursue his inclinations, lest, unhappily
<lb/>for his commerce with the world, his understanding
<lb/>should be averse to fools, and provoke him to despise
<lb/>them; and his inclinations to the tyranny of perpe

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> started, but no one else paid him any at

<p><lb/>The usual ceremonies of leave-taking now fol

<lb/>but in the midst of the dumb eloquence of his vows and

<p>	  <lb/>The Captain shrugged and retired.  But <persName>Mr.

<p>	  <lb/><q id="q070" next="q071">True, true:</q> answered <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q id="q071" prev="q070">you members

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, in leading her to the chaise, again
	  <lb/>begged permission to wait upon her in town:  <persName>Mr.

	<p>As soon as they lost sight of the house, <persName>Cecilia</persName> ex
<lb/>pressed her surprise at the behaviour of the old gen

<lb/>seclusion from the company, and absence of mind,
<lb/>had strongly excited her curiosity.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> could give her very little satisfaction:
<lb/>he told her that he had twice or thrice met him in

<p><lb/>The conversation then turned upon the family they
	  <lb/>had just quitted, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> warmly declared the

<lb/>friendship of a man who had so extensive a know

	<p><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> professed himself well satisfied that she
<lb/>should have such a counsellor; for though but little
<lb/>acquainted with him, he knew he was a man of for
<lb/>tune and fashion, and well esteemed in the world.
<lb/>They mutually compassionated his unhappy situation
	  <lb/>in domestic life, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> inoccently expressed her
	  <lb/>concern at the dislike <persName>Lady Margaret</persName> seemed to have
	  <lb/>taken to her; a dislike which <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> naturally
<lb/>imputed to her youth and beauty, yet without sus
<lb/>pecting any cause more cogent than a general jea
<lb/>lousy of attractions of which she had herself so long
<lb/>outlived the possession.</p>
<p><lb/>As their journey drew near to its conclusion, all
<lb/>the uneasy and disagreeable sensations which in the
	  <lb/>bosom of <persName>Cecilia</persName> had accompanied its commencement,
<lb/>gave way to the expectation of quick approaching
<lb/>happiness in again meeting her favourite young friend.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> had in childhood been her playmate,
<lb/>and in youth her school-fellow; a similarity of dispo

<lb/>rendered them dear to each other, though the resem

<lb/>pretensions to the wit or understanding of her friend;
<lb/>but she was amiable and obliging, and therefore suffi
<lb/>ciently deserving affection, though neither blazing
<lb/>with attractions which laid claim to admiration, nor
<lb/>endowed with those superior qualities which mingle
<lb/>respect in the love they inspire.</p>
<p><lb/>From the time of her marriage, which was near
	  <lb/>three years, she had entirely quitted <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, and had
	  <lb/>had no intercourse with <persName>Cecilia</persName> but by letter.  She

	  <lb/>from <placeName>London</placeName>, where with a large party of company
<lb/>she had spent the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p><lb/>Their meeting was tender and affectionate; the
	  <lb/>sensibility of <persName>Cecilia's</persName> heart flowed from her eyes,
	  <lb/>and the gladness of <persName>Mrs.Harrel's</persName> dimpled her cheeks.</p>
<p><lb/>As soon as their mutual salutations, expressions of

<lb/>her to the drawing-room.  But as the door was
<lb/>opened, she was struck with amazement upon finding
<lb/>that the apartment, which was spacious, lighted with
<lb/>brilliancy, and decorated with magnificence, was more
<lb/>than half filled with company, every one of which
<lb/>was dressed with gaiety and profusion.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who from the word friends, expected to

<lb/>live in the gay world, in order to obviate distressing
<lb/>mistakes, or unfortunate implications in discourse,
	  <lb/>would by <persName>Cecilia</persName> have been willingly dispensed with,
<lb/>since to her their names were as new as their per

<lb/>parties or connections, she could to nothing allude;
<lb/>it therefore served but to heighten her colour and in
<lb/>crease her embarrassment.</p>
<p><lb/>A native dignity of mind, however, which had early
<lb/>taught her to distinguish modesty from bashfulness,
<lb/>enabled her in a short time to conquer her surprise,
	  <lb/>and recover her composure.  She entreated <persName>Mrs. Har
<lb/>rel</persName> to apologise for her appearance, and being seated
<lb/>between two young ladies, endeavoured to seem re
<lb/>conciled to it herself.</p>
<p><lb/>Nor was this very difficult; for while her dress,
<lb/>which she had not changed since her journey, joined to
<lb/>the novelty of her face, attracted general observation,
<lb/>the report of her fortune, which had preceded her en
<lb/>trance, secured to her general respect.  She soon
<lb/>found, too, that a company was not necessarily formid
<lb/>able because full dressed, that familiarity could be
<lb/>united with magnificence, and that though, to her,
<lb/>every one seemed attired to walk in a procession, or
<lb/>to grace a drawing-room, no formality was assumed,
<lb/>and no solemnity was affected:  every one was with
<lb/>out restraint, even rank obtained but little distinc
<lb/>tion; ease was the general plan, and entertainment
<lb/>the general pursuit.</p>

<lb/>health of her uncle had hitherto prevented her seeing,
<lb/>was yet no stranger to company; she had passed her
<lb/>time in retirement, but not in obscurity, since for some
<lb/>years past she had presided at the table of the Dean,
<lb/>who was visited by the first people of the county in
<lb/>which he lived:  and notwithstanding his parties,
<lb/>which were frequent, though small, and elegant,
<lb/>though private, had not prepared her for the splen
<lb/>dour or the diversity of a London assembly, they yet,
<lb/>by initiating her in the practical rules of good-breed
<lb/>ing, had taught her to subdue the timid fears of total
<lb/>inexperience, and to repress the bashful feelings of
<lb/>shame-faced awkwardness; fears and feelings which
<lb/>rather call for compassion than admiration, and
<lb/>which, except in extreme youth, serve but to degrade
<lb/>the modesty they indicate.</p>
<p><lb/>She regarded, therefore, the two young ladies be
<lb/>tween whom she was seated, rather with a wish of
<lb/>addressing, than a shyness of being attacked by them;
	  <lb/>but the elder, <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, was earnestly engaged
<lb/>in a discourse with a gentleman, and the younger,
	  <lb/><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, totally discouraged her, by the invaria
<lb/>ble silence and gravity with which from time to time
<lb/>she met her eyes.</p>
<p><lb/>Uninterrupted, therefore, except by occasional
	  <lb/>speeches from <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, she spent the
<lb/>first part of the evening merely in surveying the
<lb/>company.</p>
<p><lb/>Nor was the company dilatory in returning her no
<lb/>tice, since from the time of her entrance into the
<lb/>room, she had been the object of general regard.</p>
<p><lb/>The ladies took an exact inventory of her dress,
<lb/>and internally settled how differently they would have
<lb/>been attired if blest with equal affluence.</p>

<lb/>The men disputed amongst themselves whether or
<lb/>not she was painted; and one of them asserting
<lb/>boldly that she <emph>rouged well</emph>, a debate ensued, which
<lb/>ended in a bet, and the decision was mutually agreed
<lb/>to depend upon the colour of her cheeks by the begin
	  <lb/>ning of <name>April</name>, when, if unfaded by bad hours and
<lb/>continual dissipation, they wore the same bright

<p><lb/>In about half an hour the gentleman with whom

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though surprised at an attack upon the

<lb/>to be offended at its severity.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q119" next="q120">I have often wished,</q> he continued, <q id="q120" prev="q119">that when
<lb/>large parties are collected, as here, without any pos
<lb/>sible reason why they might not as well be separated,
<lb/>something could be proposed in which each person
<lb/>might innocently take a share:  for surely, after the
<lb/>first half hour, they can find little new to observe in
<lb/>the dress of their neighbours, or to display in their
<lb/>own; and with whatever seeming gaiety they may
<lb/>contrive to fill up the middle and end of the evening,
<lb/>by wire-drawing the comments afforded by the begin

<lb/>have not four or five places to run every night,

<p><lb/>Here by the general breaking up of the party, the

<lb/>obliged to make his exit; not much to the regret of

<p><lb/>The rest of the evening, therefore, was spent

<lb/>what chilled, upon finding the fire but just lighted,

<p><lb/>At ten o'clock she made another attempt:  the

<lb/>He expressed his surprise at her early rising, in a

<lb/>bered every circumstance belonging to the plays
<lb/>in which they had formerly been companions, and
<lb/>dwelt upon every incident with a minuteness of
<lb/>delight that shewed his unwillingness ever to have
<lb/>done with the subject.</p>
<p><lb/>This discourse detained her till they were joined
	  <lb/>by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and then another more gay and more
<lb/>general succeeded to it.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>During their breakfast, <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> was an

<p><lb/><q>O impossible! there's no such thing as living

<lb/>such sweet things, 'tis impossible to pay her too
<lb/>much for them.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> now joining in the recommendation,
	  <lb/>the party was agreed upon, and accompanied by <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Arnott</persName>, the ladies proceeded to the house of the

<p>	  <lb/>Here the raptures of <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> were again ex

<lb/>with all the bitterness of mortification that she was
<lb/>unable to order home almost every thing she looked

<p><lb/>Having finished their business here, they proceed
<lb/>ed to various other dress manufacturers, in whose

<p><lb/>They then parted to dress for dinner.</p>
<p><lb/>The company of this evening were again all

<lb/>seated next to her, and whose frigid looks again com

<lb/>internal surprise, that a lady who seemed determined
<lb/>neither to give nor receive any entertainment, should
<lb/>repeatedly chuse to shew herself in a company, with
<lb/>no part of which she associated.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who contrived to occupy the seat on her
<lb/>other side, suffered not the silence with which her
<lb/>fair neighbour had infected to spread any further:
<lb/>he talked, indeed, upon no new subject; and upon
<lb/>the old one, of their former sports and amusements,
<lb/>he had already exhausted all that was worth being
<lb/>mentioned; but not yet had he exhausted the plea
<lb/>sure he received from the theme; it seemed always

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">39</mw>
<lb/>fresh, and always enchanting to him; it employed

	  <lb/>surprise, enquired for <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, observing that she
<lb/>had not seen him the whole day.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q133" next="q134">O,</q> cried his lady, <q id="q134" prev="q133">don't think of wondering at
<lb/>that, for it happens continually.  He dines at home,
<lb/>indeed, in general, but otherwise I should see no
<lb/>thing of him at all.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Indeed! why how does he fill up his time?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>That I'm sure I cannot tell, for he never con
<lb/>sults me about it; but I suppose much in the same
<lb/>way that other people do.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q135" next="q136">Ah <persName>Priscilla</persName>!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with some earnest
<lb/>ness, <q id="q136" prev="q135">how little did I ever expect to see you so
<lb/>much a fine lady!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q137" next="q138">A fine lady!</q> repeated <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q138" prev="q137">why what
<lb/>is it I do? don't I live exactly like every body else
<lb/>that mixes at all with the world?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q139" next="q140">You, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> in a low
<lb/>voice, <q id="q140" prev="q139">will I hope give to the world an example, not
<lb/>take one from it.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Soon after, they separated for the night.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The next morning, <persName>Cecilia</persName> took care to fill up her
<lb/>time more advantageously than in wandering about the
<lb/>house in search if a companion she now expected not
<lb/>to find:  she got together her books, arranged them to
<lb/>her fancy, and secured to herself, for the future occu
<lb/>pation of her leisure hours, the exhaustless fund of

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">40</mw>
<lb/>entertainment which reading, that richest, highest,
<lb/>and noblest source of intellectual enjoyment, perpe
<lb/>tually affords.</p>
<p><lb/>While they were yet at breakfast, they were again
	  <lb/>visited by <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>.  <q id="q141" next="q142">I am come,</q> cried she
	  <lb/>eagerly, <q id="q142" prev="q141">to run away with you both to my <persName>Lord
<lb/>Belgrade's</persName> sale.  All the world will be there; and
<lb/>we shall go in with tickets, and you have no notion
<lb/>how it will be crowded.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>What is to be sold there?</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q>O every thing you can conceive; house, stables,
<lb/>china, laces, horses, caps, every thing in the world.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And do you intend to buy any thing?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Lord, no; but one likes to see the people's things.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then begged they would excuse her attend
<lb/>ance.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q143" next="q144">O by no means,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q id="q144" prev="q143">you must
<lb/>go, I assure you; there'll be such a monstrous crowd
<lb/>as you never saw in your life.  I dare say we shall be
<lb/>half squeezed to death.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q145" next="q146">That,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q146" prev="q145">is an inducement which
<lb/>you must not expect will have much weight with a
<lb/>poor rustic just out of the country:  it must require all
<lb/>the polish of a long residence in the metropolis to
<lb/>make it attractive.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O but do go, for I assure you it will be the best sale
	    <lb/>we shall have this season.  I can't imagine, <persName>Mrs. Har
	      <lb/>rel</persName>, what poor <persName>Lady Belgrade</persName> will do with herself; I
<lb/>hear the creditors have seized every thing; I really
<lb/>believe the creditors are the cruellest set of people in the
<lb/>world!  They have taken those beautiful buckles out
<lb/>of her shoes!  Poor soul!  I declare it will make my
<lb/>heart ache to see them put up.  It's quite shocking,
<pb n="043"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">41</mw>
<lb/>upon my word.  I wonder who'll buy them.  I assure
<lb/>you they were the prettiest fancied I ever saw.  But
<lb/>come, if you don't go directly, there will be no get
<lb/>ting in.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> again desired to be excused accompanying
<lb/>them, adding, that she wished to spend the day at
<lb/>home.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q147" next="q148">At home, my dear?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q148" prev="q147">why
	    <lb/>we have been engaged to <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> this month,
<lb/>and she begged me to prevail with you to be of the
<lb/>party.  I expect she'll call, or send you a ticket, every
<lb/>moment.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q149" next="q150">How unlucky for me,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q150" prev="q149">that you
<lb/>should happen to have so many engagements just at
<lb/>this time!  I hope, at least, there will not be any for
<lb/>to-morrow.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>O yes; to-morrow we go to <persName>Mrs. Elton's</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Again to-morrow? and how long is this to last?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O heavens knows; I'll shew you my catalogue.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She then produced a book which contained a list of
<lb/>engagements for more than three weeks.  <q id="q150a" next="q151">And as
<lb/>these,</q> she said, <q id="q151" prev="q150a">are struck off, new ones are made;
<lb/>and so it is we go on till after the birth-day.</q></p>
<p><lb/>When this list had been examined and commented
	  <lb/>upon by <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, and viewed and wondered at
	  <lb/>by <persName>Cecilia</persName>, it was restored to its place, and the two
	  <lb/>ladies went together to the auction, permitting <persName>Ceci
<lb/>lia</persName>, at her repeated request, to return to her own
<lb/>apartment.</p>
<p><lb/>She returned, however, neither satisfied with the
<lb/>behaviour of her friend, nor pleased with her own
<lb/>situation:  the sobriety of her education, as it had
<lb/>early instilled into her mind the pure dictates of
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">2.</mw>
<pb n="044"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">42</mw>
<lb/>religion, and strict principles of honour, had also
<lb/>taught her to regard continual dissipation as an intro
<lb/>duction to vice, and unbounded extravagance as the
<lb/>harbinger of injustice.  Long accustomed to see
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> in the same retirement in which she had
<lb/>hitherto lived herself, when books were their first
<lb/>amusement, and the society of each other was their
<lb/>chief happiness, the change she now perceived in
<lb/>her mind and manners equally concerned and sur
<lb/>prised her.  She found her insensible to friendship,
<lb/>indifferent to her husband, and negligent of all social
<lb/>felicity.  Dress, company, parties of pleasure, and
<lb/>public places, seemed not merely to occupy all her
	  <lb/>time, but to gratify all her wishes.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in whose
<lb/>heart glowed the warmest affections and most gene
<lb/>rous virtue, was cruelly depressed and mortified by
<lb/>this disappointment; yet she had the good sense to
<lb/>determine against upbraiding her, well aware that if
<lb/>reproach has any power over indifference, it is only
<lb/>that of changing it to aversion.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, in truth, was innocent of heart, though
<lb/>dissipated in life; married very young, she had
<lb/>made an immediate transition from living in a private
<lb/>family and a country town, to becoming mistress of
	  <lb/>one of the most elegant houses in <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>,
<lb/>being at the head of a splendid fortune, and wife to a
<lb/>man whose own pursuits soon shewed her the little
<lb/>value he himself set upon domestic happiness.  Im
<lb/>mersed in the fashionable round of company and di
<lb/>versions, her understanding, naturally weak, was
<lb/>easily dazzled by the brilliancy of her situation;
<lb/>greedily, therefore, sucking in air impregnated with
<lb/>luxury and extravagance, she had soon no plea
<pb n="045"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">43</mw>
<lb/>sure but to vie with some rival in elegance, and no
<lb/>ambition but to exceed some superior in expence.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The Dean of  in naming <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> for
<lb/>one of the guardians of his niece, had no other
<lb/>view than that of indulging her wishes by allowing
<lb/>her to reside in the house of her friend:  he had little
<lb/>personal knowledge of him, but was satisfied with
<lb/>the nomination, because acquainted with his family,
<lb/>fortune, and connections, all which persuaded him
<lb/>to believe, without further enquiry, that it was more
<lb/>peculiarly proper for his niece than any other he
<lb/>could make.</p>
<p><lb/>In his choice of the other two trustees he had
<lb/>been more prudent; the first of these, the honour
	  <lb/>able <persName>Mr. Delville</persName>, was a man of high birth and
	  <lb/>character; the second, <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, had spent his
<lb/>whole life in business, in which he had already
<lb/>amassed an immense fortune, and had still no greater
<lb/>pleasure than that of increasing it.  From the ho
	  <lb/>nour, therefore, of <persName>Mr. Delville</persName>, he expected the
<lb/>most scrupulous watchfulness that his niece should
<lb/>in nothing be injured, and from the experience of
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> in money matters, and his diligence in
<lb/>transacting business, he hoped for the most vigilant
<lb/>observance that her fortune, while under his care,
<lb/>should be turned to the best account.  And thus, as
<lb/>far as he was able, he had equally consulted her plea
<lb/>sure, her security, and her pecuniary advantage.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> returned home only in time to dress
<lb/>for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>When <persName>Cecilia</persName> was summoned to dinner, she found,
<lb/>besides her host and hostess, and Mr. Arnott, a gen
<lb/>tleman she had not before seen, but who, as soon as
<pb n="046"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">44</mw>
	  <lb/>she entered the parlour, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> presented to
<lb/>her, saying at the same time he was one of the most
<lb/>intimate of his friends.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>This gentleman, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, was about
<lb/>thirty years of age; his face was neither remarkable
<lb/>for its beauty nor its ugliness, but sufficiently dis
<lb/>tinguished by its expression of invincible assurance;
<lb/>his person, too, though neither striking for its grace
<lb/>nor its deformity, attracted notice from the insolence
<lb/>of his deportment.  His manners, haughty and super
<lb/>cilious, marked the high opinion he cherished of his
<lb/>own importance; and his air and address, at once
<lb/>bold and negligent, announced his happy perfection
<lb/>in the character at which he aimed, that of an ac
<lb/>complished man of the town.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The moment <persName>Cecilia</persName> appeared, she bacame the ob
<lb/>ject of his attention, though neither with the look of
<lb/>admiration due her beauty, nor yet with that of
<lb/>curiosity excited by her novelty, but with the scruti
<lb/>nizing observation of a man on the point of making
<lb/>a bargain, who views with fault-seeking eyes the
<lb/>property he means to cheapen.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, wholly unused to an examination so little
<lb/>ceremonious, shrunk abashed from his regards:  but
<lb/>his conversation was not less displeasing to her
<lb/>than his looks; his principal subjects, which were
<lb/>horse-racing, losses at play, and disputes at gaming
<lb/>tables, could afford her but little amusement, because
<lb/>she could not understand them; and the episodes
<lb/>with which they were occasionally interspersed, con
<lb/>sisting chiefly of comparitive strictures upon cele
<lb/>brated beauties, hints of impending bankruptcies,
<lb/>and witticisms upon recent divorces, were yet more

<lb/>disagreeable to her, because more intelligible.
<lb/>Wearied, therefore, with uninteresting anecdotes,
<lb/>and offended with injudicious subjects of pleasantry,
<lb/>she waited with impatience for the moment of retir
	  <lb/>ing; but <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, less eager, because better en
<lb/>tertained, was in no haste to remove, and therefore
<lb/>she was compelled to remain quiet, till they were
<lb/>both obliged to arise, in order to fulfill their engage
	  <lb/>ment with <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>As they went together to the house of that lady,
	  <lb/>in <persName>Mrs. Harrel's</persName> vis-a-vis, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, not doubting but
<lb/>their opinions of the Baronet would accord,
<lb/>instantly and openly declared her disapprobation of
	  <lb/>every thing he had uttered; but <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, far
<lb/>from confirming her expectations, only said, <q>I am
<lb/>sorry you don't like him, for he is almost always with
<lb/>us.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Do you like him, then, yourself?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Extremely; he is very entertaining and clever,
<lb/>and knows the world.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q152" next="q153">How judiciously do you praise him!</q> cried
	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q153" prev="q152">and how long might you deliberate before
<lb/>you could add another word to his panegyric!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, satisfied to commend, without even
<lb/>attempting to vindicate him, was soon content to
	  <lb/>change the subject; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, though much con
<lb/>cerned that the husband of her friend had made so
<lb/>disgraceful an election of a favourite, yet hoped that
	  <lb/>the lenity of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> resulted from her desire to
<lb/>excuse his choice, not from her own approbation.</p></div>

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> soon engaged herself at a card-table:
	  <lb/>and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who declined playing, was seated next to
	  <lb/><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, who arose to return the curtsey she
<lb/>made in advancing to her, but that past, did not even
<lb/>look at her.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though fond of conversation and formed
<lb/>for society, was too diffident to attempt speaking
<lb/>where so little encouraged; they both, therefore,
	  <lb/>continued silent, till <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
	  <lb/>and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> entered the room together, and all at

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who had placed himself opposite to

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> now joined another party; and <persName>Mr.

<lb/>moved round to the back of her chair, where he pa

<lb/>Robert</persName> still kept his post, and still, without troubling
<lb/>himself to speak, kept his eyes fixed upon the same
<lb/>object.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, offended by his boldness, looked a thou
<lb/>sand ways to avoid him; but her embarrassment, by
<lb/>giving greater play to her features, served only to
<lb/>keep awake an attention which might otherwise have
<lb/>wearied.  She was almost tempted to move her chair
	  <lb/>round and face <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, but though she wished to
<lb/>shew her disapprobation of the Baronet, she had not
<lb/>yet been reconciled by fashion to turning her back
<lb/>upon the company at large, for the indulgence of con
<lb/>versing with some particular person:  a fashion
<lb/>which to unaccustomed observers seems rude and re
<lb/>pulsive, but which, when once adopted, carries with
<lb/>it imperceptibly its own recommendation, in the ease,
<lb/>convenience, and freedom which it promotes.</p>
<pb n="052"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">48</mw>
<p>
<lb/>Thus disagreeably stationed, she found but little
	  <lb/>assistance from the neighbourhood of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb/>since even his own desire of conversing with her, was
<lb/>swallowed up by an anxious and involuntary impulse
	  <lb/>to watch the looks and motions of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>At length, quite tired of sitting as if merely an ob
<lb/>ject to be gazed at, she determined to attempt enter
	  <lb/>ing into a conversation with <persName>Miss Leeson</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>The difficulty, however, was not inconsiderable
<lb/>how to make the attack, she was unacquainted with
<lb/>her friends and connections, uninformed of her way of
<lb/>thinking, or her way of life, ignorant even of the
<lb/>sound of her voice, and chilled by the coldness of her
<lb/>aspect:  yet, having no other alternative, she was
<lb/>more willing to encounter the forbidding looks of this
<lb/>lady, than to continue silently abashed under the scru
	  <lb/>tinizing eyes of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>After much deliberation with what subject to begin,
	  <lb/>she remembered that <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> had been present
<lb/>the first time they had met, and thought it probable
<lb/>they might be acquainted with each other; and there
<lb/>fore, bending forward, she ventured to enquire if she
<lb/>had lately seen that young lady?</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, in a voice alike inexpressive of satis
<lb/>faction or displeasure, quietly answered, <q>No,
<lb/>ma'am.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, discouraged by this conciseness, was a
	  <lb/>few minutes silent; but the perseverance of <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert</persName> in staring at her, exciting her own in trying to
<lb/>avoid his eyes, she exerted herself so far as to add,
	  <lb/><q>Does <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> expect <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> here this
<lb/>evening?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, without raising her head, gravely re

<pb n="053"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="G1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">49</mw>
<p>
<lb/>All was now to be done over again, and a new sub
<lb/>ject to be started, for she could suggest nothing
	  <lb/>further to ask concerning <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> had seen little of life, but that little she had
<lb/>well marked, and her observation had taught her,
<lb/>that among fashionable people, public places seemed
<lb/>a never-failing source of conversation and entertain
<lb/>ment:  upon this topic, therefore, she hoped for
<lb/>better success; and as to those who have spent more
	  <lb/>time in the country than in <placeName>London</placeName>, no place of
<lb/>amusement is so interesting as a theatre.  She opened
<lb/>the subject she had so happily suggested, by an en
<lb/>quiry whether any new play had lately come out?</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, with the same dryness, only answered,
<lb/><q>Indeed I can't tell.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Another pause now followed, and the spirits of
	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> were considerable dampt; but happening ac
	  <lb/>cidentaly to recollect the name of <persName>Almack</persName>, she
<lb/>presently revived, and congratulating herself that
<lb/>she should now be able to speak of a place too
<lb/>fashionable for disdain, she asked her, in a manner
<lb/>somewhat more assured, if she was a subscriber to
<lb/>his assemblies?</p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, ma'am.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Do you go to them constantly?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, ma'am.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Again they were both silent.  And now, tired of
<lb/>finding the ill success of each particular enquiry,
<lb/>she thought a more general one might obtain an an
<lb/>swer less laconic, and therefore she begged she would
<lb/>inform her <q>what was the most fashionable place of
<lb/>diversion for the present season?</q></p>

<p>
	  <lb/>This question, however, cost <persName>Miss Leeson</persName> no more
<lb/>trouble than any which had preceded it, for she only
<lb/>replied <q>Indeed I don't know.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> now began to sicken of her attempt, and for
<lb/>some minutes to give it up as hopeless; but after
<lb/>wards, when she reflected how frivolous were the
<lb/>questions she had asked, she felt more inclined to
<lb/>pardon the answers she had received, and in a short
<lb/>time to fancy she had mistaken contempt for stupidity,
	  <lb/>and to grow less angry with <persName>Miss Leeson</persName> than
<lb/>ashamed of herself.</p>
<p><lb/>This supposition excited her to make yet another
<lb/>trial of her talents for conversation; and there
<lb/>fore, summoning up all the courage in her power, she
<lb/>modestly apologized for the liberty she was taking,
<lb/>and then begged her permission to enquire <q>whether
<lb/>there was any thing new in the literary way that she

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Miss Leeson</persName> now turned her eyes towards her, with
<lb/>a look that implied a doubt whether she had heard
	  <lb/>aright; and when the attentive attitude of <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>confirmed her question, surprise for a few instants
<lb/>took place of insensibility, and with rather more
<lb/>spirit than she had yet shown, she answered, <q>In
<lb/>deed I know nothing of the matter.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was now utterly disconcerted; and half
<lb/>angry with herself, and wholly provoked with her
<lb/>sullen neighbour, she resolved to let nothing in fu
<lb/>ture provoke her to a similar trial with so unpromis
<lb/>ing a subject.</p>
<p><lb/>She had not, however, much longer to endure the

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> was a man of good parts, and keen
<lb/>satire; minute in his observations, and ironical in his
<lb/>expressions.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>So you don't play, <persName>Sir Robert</persName>?</q> he cried.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>What here?  No, I am going to <persName>Brooks's</persName>.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>But how do you like <persName>Harrel's</persName> Ward?  You have
<lb/>taken a pretty good survey of her.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why faith I don't know; but not much, I think;
<lb/>she's a devilish fine woman too; but she has no spirit,
<lb/>no life.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Did you try her?  Have you talked to her?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Not I, truly!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Nay, then, how do you mean to judge her?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, faith, that's all over now; one never thinks of
<lb/>talking to the women by way of trying them.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What other method, then, have you adopted?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q rend="pre()post()">None.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>None?  Why then how do you go on?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why they talk to us.  The women take all that

<p><lb/><q>And pray how long may you have commenced <mcr>fade
<lb/>macaroni?</mcr> for this is a part of your character with
<lb/>which I was not acquainted.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, hang it, 'tis not from <mcr>ton</mcr>; no, it's merely from
<lb/>laziness.  Who the dl will fatigue himslf with
<lb/>dancing attendance upon the women, when keeping
<lb/>them at a distance makes them dance attendance upon
<lb/>us?</q></p>

<lb/>of two syllables.  The <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">ton</emph> misses, as they are called,
<lb/>who now infest the town, are in two divisions, the

<lb/>think worthy their notice.  But this they have in
<lb/>common, that at home they think of nothing but dress,
<lb/>abroad, of nothing but admiration, and that every

<lb/><q>But it is not capacity alone you are to consult

<lb/>fore, to render their commerce somewhat difficult,
<lb/>they will only be pleased by an observance of their
<lb/>humours; which are ever most various and most exu
<lb/>berant where the intellects are weakest and least

<p><lb/><q id="q176" next="q177">I will give it you,</q> he answered, <q id="q177" prev="q176">with full di

<lb/>seems resolutely determined not to speak, or who, if
<lb/>compelled by a direct question to make some answer,
<lb/>drily gives a brief affirmative, or coldly a laconic
<lb/>negative.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>A case in point!</q> interrupted <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q178" next="q179">Well, thus circumstanced,</q> he continued, <q id="q179" prev="q178">the

<p><lb/><q>Dress, public places, and love.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, half surprised and half diverted, waited a

<p><lb/><q>These three topics,</q> he continued, <q>are to answer

<lb/>causes from which the silence of young ladies may
<lb/>proceed:  sorrow, affectation, and stupidity.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/><q id="q180" next="q181">I give much to it,</q> he answered, <q id="q181" prev="q180">as an excuse,
<lb/>nay almost as an equivalent for wit; but for that sullen
<lb/>silence which resists all encouragement, modesty is a
<lb/>mere pretence, not a cause.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You must, however, be somewhat more explicit,
<lb/>if you mean that I should benefit from your instruc
<lb/>tions.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q182" next="q183">Well then,</q> he answered, <q id="q183" prev="q182">I will briefly enume
<lb/>rate the three causes, with directions for the three me
<lb/>thods of cure.  To begin with sorrow.  The tacitur
<lb/>nity which really results from that is attended with
<lb/>an incurable absence of mind, and a total unconsciousness
<lb/>of the observation which it excites; upon this occasion,
<lb/>public places may sometimes be tried in vain, and
<lb/>even dress may fail; but love</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q184" next="q185">Are you sure, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with a laugh,
<lb/><q id="q185" prev="q184">that sorrow has but that one source?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q186" next="q187">By no means,</q> answered he, <q id="q187" prev="q186">for perhaps papa
<lb/>may have been angry, or mamma may have been cross;
<lb/>a milliner may have sent the wrong pompoon, or a <foreign lang="fre">cha
<lb/>peron</foreign> to an assembly may have been taken ill </q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Bitter subjects of affliction, indeed!  And are these
<lb/>all you allow us?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Nay, I speak but of young ladies of fashion, and
<lb/>what of greater importance can befal them?  If there
<lb/>fore, the grief of the fair patient proceeds from papa,
<lb/>mamma, or the <foreign lang="fre">chaperon,</foreign> then the mention of public
<lb/>places, those endless incentives of displeasure between
<lb/>the old and the young, will draw forth her complaints,
<lb/>and her complaints will bring their own cure, for those
<lb/>who lament find speedy consolation:  if the milliner
<lb/>has occasioned the calamity, the discussion of the dress
<lb/>will have the same effect; should both these medicines

<milestone unit="sig" n="G4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">55</mw>
<lb/>fail, love, as I said before, will be found infallible,
<lb/>for you will then have investigated every subject of
<lb/>uneasiness which a youthful female in high life can
<lb/>experience.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q188" next="q189">They are greatly obliged to you,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>bowing, <q id="q189" prev="q188">for granting them motives of sorrow so
<lb/>honourable, and I thank you in the name of the whole

<p><lb/><q id="q190" next="q191">You, madam,</q> said he, returning her bow, <q id="q191" prev="q190">are
<lb/>I hope an exception in the happiest way, that of
<lb/>having no sorrow at all.  I come, now, to the silence
<lb/>of affectation, which is presently discernable by the
<lb/>roving of the eye round the room to see if it is heeded,
<lb/>by the sedulous care to avoid an accidental smile, and
<lb/>by the variety of disconsolate attitudes exhibited to the
<lb/>beholders.  This species of silence has almost without
<lb/>exception its origin in that babyish vanity which is
<lb/>always gratified by exciting attention, without ever
<lb/>perceiving that it provokes contempt.  In these cases,
<lb/>as nature, is wholly out of the question, and the mind
<lb/>is guarded against its own feelings, dress and public
<lb/>places are almost certain of failing, but here again
<lb/>love is sure to vanquish; as soon as it is named, at
<lb/>tention becomes involuntary, and in a short time a
<lb/>struggling simper discomposes the arrangement of the
<lb/>features, and then the business is presently over, for
<lb/>the young lady is either supporting some system, or
<lb/>opposing some proposition, before she is well aware
<lb/>that she has been cheated out of her sad silence at
<lb/>all.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q192" next="q193">So much,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,

<lb/><q id="q194" next="q195">That must always be heavy work,</q> returned he,
<lb/><q id="q195" prev="q194">yet the road is plain, though it is all up-hill.  Love,
<lb/>here, may be talked of without exciting any emotion,
<lb/>or provoking any reply, and dress may be dilated upon
<lb/>without producing any other effect than that of at
<lb/>tracting a vacant stare; but public places are indubi
<lb/>tably certain of success.  Dull and heavy characters,
<lb/>incapable of animating from wit or from reason, be
<lb/>cause unable to keep pace with them, and void of all
<lb/>internal sources of entertainment, require the stimu
<lb/>lation of show, glare, noise, and bustle, to interest or
<lb/>awaken them.  Talk to them of such subjects, and
<lb/>they adore you; no matter whether you paint to them
<lb/>joy or horror, let there be but action, and they are
<lb/>content; a battle has charms for them equal to a coro
<lb/>nation, and a funeral amuses them as much as a

	    <lb/>and all <persName>Lady Belgrade's</persName> trinkets.  I never saw such
<lb/>a collection of sweet things in my life.  I was ready
<lb/>to cry that I could not bid for half a hundred of them.
<lb/>I declare I was kept in an agony the whole morning.
<lb/>I would not but have been there for the world.
<lb/>Poor Lady Belgrade! you really can't conceive
<lb/>how I was shocked for her.  All her beautiful
<lb/>things sold for almost nothing.  I assure you if you

<p><lb/><q>Why I'll tell you what it was, and then you shall

<lb/>you ever saw in your life; but I would not make it
<lb/>up, because there was not a creature in town, so
<lb/>I thought to bring it out quite new in about a

	    <lb/>who should I meet but <persName>Miss Moffat</persName>!  She had
<lb/>been in town some days, but so monstrously engaged,

<lb/>great hurry to shake hands, and what do you think
<lb/>was the first thing that struck my eyes?  Why just
<lb/>such a trimming as my own, upon a nasty odious
<lb/>gown, and half dirty!  Can you conceive any thing so

<lb/>to come over just now.  I wish the Custom-house

            <lb/>sanguine, looked at him with uneasiness, and waited
            <lb/>his departure with impatience.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> began to imagine he had been commis
            <lb/>sioned to call upon her with some message from <persName>Mr.
                <lb/>Monckton</persName>:  for she knew not how to suppose that
            <lb/>merely and accidentally having spent an hour or two
            <lb/>in the same room with her, would authorize a visiting
            <lb/>acquaintance.  <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, however, had a facility
            <lb/>the most happy of reconciling his pretensions to his
            <lb/>inclination; and therefore she soon found that the
            <lb/>apology she had suggested appeared to him unneces
            <lb/>sary.  To lead, however, to the subject from which
            <lb/>she expected his excuse, she enquired how long he
            <lb/>had left <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>?</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q218" next="q219">But yesterday noon ma'am,</q> he answered, <q id="q219" prev="q218">or

        <p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had only been perplexing herself to
            <lb/>devise some reason why he came at all, now looked
            <lb/>at him with a grave surprise, which would totally
            <lb/>have abashed a man whose courage had been less, or
            <lb/>whose expectations had been greater; but <persName>Mr. Mor
                <lb/>rice</persName>, though he hazarded every danger upon the
            <lb/>slightest chance of hope, knew too well the weakness
            <lb/>of his claims to be confident of success, and had been
            <lb/>too familiar with rebuffs to be much hurt by receiv
            <lb/>ing them.  He might possibly have something to
            <lb/>gain, but he knew he had nothing to lose.</p>

            <lb/>visit, if any he had, or if, as she now suspected he
            <lb/>had none, to weary him into a retreat.</p>
        <p><lb/>But this plan, though it would have succeeded with

            <lb/>others, added an equal portion of insensibility that
            <lb/>hardened him against all indignity.  Finding, there
            <lb/>fore, that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, to to whom his visit was intended,
            <lb/>seemed already satisfied with its length, he prudently
            <lb/>forbore to torment her; but perceiving that the
            <lb/>lady of the house was more accessible, he quickly
            <lb/>made a transfer of his attention, and addressed his
            <lb/>discourse to her with as much pleasure as if his only
            <lb/>view had been to see her, and as much ease as if he
            <lb/>had known her all his life.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/>With <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> this conduct was not injudicious;

            <lb/>ing.  They conversed, therefore, upon pretty equal
            <lb/>terms, and neither of them were yet tired, when they
            <lb/>were interrupted by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who came into the

            <lb/>made to fasten himself upon <persName>Cecilia</persName> as an acqaint
            <lb/>ance, had not, it is true, from herself met with much
            <lb/>encouragement; but he knew the chances were
            <lb/>against him when he made the trial, and therefore
            <lb/>the prospect of gaining admission into such a house
            <lb/>as <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s was not only sufficient to make
            <lb/>amends for what scarcely amounted to a disappoint
            <lb/>ment, but a subject of serious comfort from the credit
            <lb/>of the connection, and of internal exultation at his
            <lb/>own management and address.</p>
        <p><lb/>In the evening, the ladies, as usual, went to a
            <lb/>private assembly, and, as usual, were attended to it
            <lb/>by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.  The other gentlemen had engage
            <lb/>ments elsewhere.</p></div>

<p>
	  <lb/><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Several</hi> days passed on nearly in the same manner;
<lb/>the mornings were all spent in gossipping, shopping,
<lb/>and dressing, and the evenings were regularly appro
<lb/>priated to public places, or large parties of company.</p>
<p><lb/>Meanwhile <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> lived almost entirely in
	  <lb/><placeName>Portman-square;</placeName> he slept, indeed, at his own lodg
<lb/>ings, but he boarded wholly with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, whose
<lb/>house he never for a moment quitted till night, except
<lb/>to attend <persName>Cecilia</persName> and his sister in their visitings and
<lb/>rambles.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was a young man of unexceptionable
<lb/>character, and of a disposition mild, serious, and be
<lb/>nignant:  his principles and blameless conduct ob
<lb/>tained the universal esteem of the world, but his
<lb/>manners, which were rather too precise, joined to an
<lb/>uncommon gravity of countenance and demeanor,
<lb/>made his society rather permitted as a duty,
<lb/>than sought as a pleasure.</p>
<p><lb/>The charms of <persName>Cecilia</persName> had forcibly, suddenly, and
<lb/>deeply penetrated his heart; he only lived in her
<lb/>presence, away from her he hardly existed:  the
<lb/>emotions she excited were rather those of adoration
<pb n="073"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">69</mw>
<lb/>than of love, for he gazed upon her beauty till he
<lb/>thought her more than human, and hung upon her
<lb/>accents till all speech seemed impertinent to him but
<lb/>her own.  Yet so small were his expectations of suc
<lb/>cess, that not even to his sister did he hint at the
<lb/>situation of his heart:  happy in an easy access to
<lb/>her, he contented himself with seeing, hearing,
<lb/>and watching her, beyond which bounds he formed
<lb/>not any plan, and scarce indulged any hope.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, too, was a frequent visiter in
	  <lb/><placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, where he dined almost daily.
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was chagrined at seeing so much of him, and
<lb/>provoked to find herself almost constantly the object
<lb/>of his unrestrained examination; she was, however,
<lb/>far more seriously concerned for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, when
<lb/>she discovered that this favourite friend of her hus
<lb/>band was an unprincipled spendthrift, and an extra
<lb/>vagant gamester:  for as he was the inseparable com
<lb/>panion of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, she dreaded the consequence
<lb/>both of his influence and his example.</p>
<p><lb/>She saw, too, with an amazement that daily in
<lb/>creased, the fatigue, yet fascination of a life of plea
<lb/>sure:  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seemed to consider his own house
<lb/>merely as an Hotel, where at any hour of the night he
<lb/>might disturb the family to claim admittance, where
<lb/>letters and messages might be left for him, where he
<lb/>dined when no other dinner was offered him, and
<lb/>where, when he made an appointment, he was to be
<lb/>met with.  His lady, too, though more at home,
<lb/>was not therefore more solitary; her acquaintance
<lb/>were numerous, expensive and idle, and every mo
<lb/>ment not actually spent in company, was scrupulously
<lb/>devoted to making arrangements for that purpose.</p>
<pb n="074"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">70</mw>
<p><lb/>In a short time <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who every day had hoped
<lb/>that the next would afford her greater satisfaction,
<lb/>but who every day found the present no better than
<lb/>the former, began to grow weary of eternally run
<lb/>ning the same round, and to sicken at the irksome
<lb/>repetition of unremitting yet uninteresting dissi
<lb/>pation.  She saw nobody she wished to see, as she
<lb/>had met with nobody for whom she could care; for
<lb/>though sometimes those with whom she mixed ap
<lb/>peared to be amiable, she knew that their manners,
<lb/>like their persons, were in their best array, and
<lb/>therefore she had too much understanding to judge
<lb/>decisively of their characters.  But what chiefly
<lb/>damped her hopes of forming a friendship with any
<lb/>of the new acquaintance to whom she was introduced,
<lb/>was the observation she herself made, how ill the
<lb/>coldness of their hearts accorded with the warmth of
<lb/>their professions:  upon every first meeting, the civi
<lb/>lities which were shown her, flattered her into be
<lb/>lieving she had excited a partiality that a very
<lb/>little time would ripen into affection; the next meet
<lb/>ing commonly confirmed the expectation; but the
<lb/>third, and every future one, regularly destroyed it.
<lb/>She found that time added nothing to their fondness,
<lb/>nor intimacy to their sincerity; that the interest in
<lb/>her welfare which appeared to be taken at first sight,
<lb/>seldom, with whatever reason, increased, and often
<lb/>without any, abated; that the distinction she at first
<lb/>met with, was no effusion of kindness, but of cu
<lb/>riosity, which is scarcely sooner gratified than sati
<lb/>ated; and that those who lived always the life into
<lb/>which she had only lately been initiated, were as
<lb/>much harassed with it as herself, though less
<pb n="075"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">71</mw>
<lb/>spirited to relenquish, and more helpless to better it;
<lb/>and that they coveted nothing but what was new,
<lb/>because they had experienced the insufficiency of
<lb/>whatever was familiar.</p>
<p><lb/>She began now to regret the loss she sustained in
<lb/>quitting the neighbourhood, and being deprived of the
<lb/>conversation of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, and yet more
<lb/>earnestly to miss the affection and sigh for the so
	  <lb/>ciety of <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, the lady with whom she had
<lb/>long and happily resided at Bury; for she was very
<lb/>soon compelled to give up all expectation of renew
<lb/>ing the felicity of her earlier years, by being restored
<lb/>to the friendship of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, in whom she had
<lb/>mistaken the kindness of childish intimacy for the
<lb/>sincerity of chosen affection; and though she saw her
<lb/>credulous error with mortificaiton and displeasure,
<lb/>she regretted it with tenderness and sorrow.  <q id="q270" next="q271">What,
<lb/>at last,</q> cried she, <q id="q271" prev="q270">is human felicity, who has
<lb/>tasted, and where is it to be found?  If I, who, to
<lb/>others, seem marked out for even a partial possession
<lb/>of it,--distinguished by fortune, caressed by the
<lb/>world, brought into the circle of high life, and sur
<lb/>rounded with splendour, seek without finding, yet
<lb/>losing, scarce know how I miss it!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Ashamed upon reflection to believe she was con
<lb/>sidered as an object of envy by others, while repin
<lb/>ing and discontented herself, she determined no
<lb/>longer to be the only one insensible to the blessings
<lb/>within her reach, but by projecting and adopting
<lb/>some plan of conduct, better suited to her taste and
<lb/>feelings than the frivolous insipidity of her present
<lb/>life, to make at once a more spirited and more worthy
<lb/>use of the affluence, freedom and power which she
<lb/>possessed.</p>
<pb n="076"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">72</mw>
<p>
<lb/>A scheme of happiness at once rational and refined
<lb/>soon presented itself to her imagination.  She pur
<lb/>posed, for the basis of her plan, to become mistress
<lb/>of her own time, and with this view, to drop all idle
<lb/>and uninteresting acquaintance, who while they con
<lb/>tribute neither to use nor pleasure, make so large a
<lb/>part of the community, that they may properly be cal
<lb/>led the underminers of existence:  she could then
<lb/>show some taste and discernment in her choice of
<lb/>friends, and she resolved to select such only as by
<lb/>their piety could elevate her mind, by their know
<lb/>ledge improve her understanding, or by their accom
<lb/>plishments and manners delight her affections.  This
<lb/>regulation, if strictly adhered to, would soon relieve
<lb/>her from the fatigue of receiving many visiters,
<lb/>and therefore she might have all the leisure she could
<lb/>desire for the pursuit of her favouite studies, music
<lb/>and reading.</p>
<p><lb/>Having thus, from her own estimation of human
<lb/>perfection, culled whatever was noblest for her so
<lb/>ciety, and from her own ideas of sedentary enjoy
<lb/>ments, arranged the occupations of her hours of soli
<lb/>tude, she felt fully satisfied with the portion of hap
<lb/>piness which her scheme promised to herself, and
<lb/>began next to consider what was due from her to the
<lb/>world.</p>
<p><lb/>And not without trembling did she then look for
<lb/>ward to the claims which the splendid income she was
<lb/>soon to possess would call upon her to discharge.  A
<lb/>strong sense of <mcr rend="slant(smallcaps)">duty</mcr>, a fervent desire to <mcr rend="case(smallcaps)">act right</mcr>,
<lb/>were the ruling characteristics of her mind:  her af
<lb/>fluence she therefore considered as a debt contracted
<lb/>with the poor; and her independence, as a tie upon
<lb/>her liberality to pay it with interest.</p>
<pb n="077"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">73</mw>
<p>
<lb/>Many and various, then, soothing to her spirit and
<lb/>grateful to her sensibility, were the scenes which her
<lb/>fancy delineated; now she supported an orphan, now
<lb/>softened the sorrows of a widow, now snatched from
<lb/>iniquity the feeble trembler at poverty, and now res
<lb/>cued from shame the proud struggler with disgrace.
<lb/>The prospect at once exalted her hopes, and enrap
<lb/>tured her imagination; she regarded herself as an
<lb/>agent of Charity, and already in idea anticipated the
<lb/>rewards of a good and faithful delegate:  so animat
<lb/>ing are the designs of disinterested benovolence! so
<lb/>pure is the bliss of intellectual philanthropy!</p>
<p><lb/>Not immediately, however, could this plan be put
<lb/>in execution; the society she meant to form could not
<lb/>be selected in the house of another, where, though to
<lb/>some she might show a preference, there were none
<lb/>she could reject:  nor had she yet the power to in
<lb/>dulge, according to the munificence of her wishes, the
<lb/>extensive generosity she projected:  these purposes
<lb/>demanded a house of her own, and the unlimited
<lb/>disposal of her fortune, neither of which she could
<lb/>claim till she became of age.  That period, however,
<lb/>was only eight months distant, and she pleased
<lb/>herself with the intention of meliorating her
<lb/>plan in the mean time, and preparing to put it in
<lb/>practice.</p>
<p><lb/>But though, in common with all the race of still
<lb/>expecting man, she looked for that happiness in the
<lb/>time to come which the present failed to afford, she
<lb/>had yet the spirit and good sense to determine upon
<lb/>making every effort in her power, to render her im
<lb/>mediate way of life more useful and contented.</p>
<p><lb/>Her first wish therefore, now, was to quit the house

<lb/>of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, where she neither met with entertain
<lb/>ment nor instruction, but was perpetually mortified
<lb/>by seeing the total indifference of the friend in whose
<lb/>society she had hoped for nothing but affection.</p>
<p><lb/>The will of her uncle, though it obliged her while
<lb/>under-age to live with one of her guardians, left her
<lb/>at liberty to chuse and to change amongst them ac
<lb/>cording to her wishes or convenience:  she deter
<lb/>mined, therefore, to make a visit herself to each of
<lb/>them, to observe their manners and way of life, and
<lb/>then, to the best of her judgement, decide with which
<lb/>she could be most contented:  resolving, however, not
<lb/>to hint at her intention till it was ripe for execution,
<lb/>and then honestly to confess the reasons of her re
<lb/>treat.</p>
<p><lb/>She had acquainted them both of her journey to
<lb/>town the morning of her arrival.  She was almost
<lb/>an entire stranger to each of them, as she had not
	  <lb/>seen <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> since she was nine years old, nor
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Delville</persName> within the time she could remember.</p>
<p><lb/>The very morning that she had settled her pro
<lb/>ceedings for the arrangement of this new plan, she
<lb/>intended to request the use of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s carriage,
<lb/>and to make, without delay, the visits preparatory to
<lb/>her removal:  but when she entered the parlour upon
<lb/>a summons to breakfast, her eagerness to quit the
<lb/>house gave way, for present, to the pleasure she
<lb/>felt at the sight of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who was just ar
	  <lb/>rived from <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb/>She expressed her satisfaction in the most lively
<lb/>terms, and scrupled not to tell him she had not once
<lb/>been so pleased since her journey to town, ex
<lb/>cept at her first meeting with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.</p>
<pb n="079"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">75</mw>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, whose delight was infinitely su
<lb/>perior to her own, and whose joy in seeing her was
<lb/>redoubled by the affectionate frankness of her recep
<lb/>tion, stifled the emotions to which her sight gave rise,
<lb/>and denying himself the solace of expressing his
<lb/>feelings, seemed much less charmed than herself at
<lb/>the meeting, and suffered no word nor look to escape
<lb/>him, beyond what could be authorized by friendly
<lb/>civility.</p>
<p><lb/>He then renewed with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> an acquaint
<lb/>ance which had been formed before her marriage, but
<lb/>which he had dropt when her distance from <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>upon whose account alone he had thought it worth
<lb/>cultivation, made it no longer of use to him.  She
<lb/>afterwards introduced her brother to him; and a con
<lb/>versation very interesting to both the ladies took
<lb/>place, concerning several families with which they
<lb/>had been formerly connected, as well as the neigh
<lb/>bourhood at large in which they had lately dwelt.</p>
<p><lb/>Very little was the share taken by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> in
<lb/>these accounts and enquiries; the unaffected joy with
<lb/>which <persName>Cecilia</persName> had received <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, had struck
<lb/>him with a sensation of envy as involuntary as it was
<lb/>painful:  he did not, indeed, suspect that gentleman's
<lb/>secret views; no reason for suspicion was obvious,
<lb/>and his penetration sunk not deeper than appear
<lb/>ances; he knew, too, that he was married, and there
<lb/>fore no jealousy occurred to him; but still she had
<lb/>smiled upon him!and he felt that to purchase
<lb/>for himself a smile of so much sweetness, he would
<lb/>have sacrificed almost all else that was valuable to
<lb/>him upon earth.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>With an attention infinitely more accurate, <persName>Mr.
<pb n="080"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">76</mw>
<lb/>Monckton</persName> had returned his observations.  The un
<lb/>easiness of his mind was apparent, and the anxious
<lb/>watchfulness of his eye plainly manifested whence it
<lb/>arose.  From a situation, indeed, which permitted an
<lb/>intercourse the most constant and unrestrained with
<lb/>such an object as <persName>Cecilia</persName>, nothing less could be ex
<lb/>pected, and therefore he considered his admiration as
<lb/>inevitable; all that remained to be discovered, was
<lb/>the reception it had met from his fair enslaver.  Nor
<lb/>was he here long in doubt; he soon saw that she was
<lb/>not merely free from all passion herself, but had so
<lb/>little watched <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> as to be unconscious she
<lb/>had inspired any.</p>
<p><lb/>Yet was his own serenity, though apparently un
<lb/>moved, little less disturbed in secret than that of his
<lb/>rival; he did not think him a formidable candidate,
<lb/>but he dreaded the effect of intimacy, fearing she
<lb/>might first grow accustomed to his attentions, and
<lb/>then become pleased with them:  he apprehended,
<lb/>also, the influence of his sister, and of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> in
<lb/>his favour; and though he had no difficulty to per
<lb/>suade himself that any offer he might now make
<lb/>would be rejected without hesitation, he knew too
<lb/>well the insidious properties of perseverance, to see
<lb/>him, without inquietude, situated so advantageously.</p>
<p><lb/>The morning was far advanced before he took leave,
<lb/>yet he found no opportunity of discoursing with
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though he impatiently desired to examine
<lb/>into the state of her mind, and to discover whether
<lb/>her London journey had added any fresh difficulties
<lb/>to the success of his long-concerted scheme.  But as
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> invited him to dinner, he hoped the after
<lb/>noon would be more propitious to his wishes.</p>
<pb n="081"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="K3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">77</mw>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, too, was eager to communicate to him
<lb/>her favourite project, and to receive his advice with
<lb/>respect to its execution.  She had long been used to
<lb/>his counsel, and she was now more than ever solicit
<lb/>ous to obtain it, because she considered him as the
<lb/>only person in London who was interested in her
<lb/>welfare.</p>
<p><lb/>He saw, however, no promise of better success
<lb/>when he made his appearance at dinner time, for not
	  <lb/>only <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was already arrived, but <persName>Sir Robert
<lb/>Floyer</persName>; and he found <persName>Cecilia</persName> so much the object of
<lb/>their mutual attention, that he had still less chance
<lb/>than in the morning of speaking to her unheard.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>Yet he was not idle; the sight of <persName>Sir Robert</persName> gave
<lb/>abundant employment to his penetration, which was
<lb/>immediately at work, to discover the motive of his
<lb/>visit:  but this, with all his sagacity, was not easily
<lb/>decided; for though the constant direction of his
<lb/>eyes towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>, proved, at least, that he was
<lb/>not insensible of her beauty, his carelessness whether
<lb/>or not she was hurt by his examination, the little
<lb/>pains he took to converse with her, and the invariable
<lb/>assurance and negligence of his manners, seemed
<lb/>strongly to demonstrate an indifference to the sen
<lb/>timents he inspired, totally incompatible with the so
<lb/>licitude of affection.</p>
<p><lb/>In <persName>Cecilia</persName> he had nothing to observe but what his
<lb/>knowledge of her character prepared him to expect, a
<lb/>shame no less indignant than modest at the freedom
<lb/>with which she saw herself surveyed.</p>
<p><lb/>Very little, therefore, was the satisfaction which
<lb/>this visit procured him, for soon after dinner the
<lb/>ladies retired; and as they had an early engagement

<lb/>for the evening, the gentlemen received no summons
<lb/>to their tea-table.  But he contrived, before they
<lb/>quitted the room, to make an appointment for attend
<lb/>ing them the next morning to a rehearsal of a new
<lb/>serious Opera.</p>
<p><lb/>He stayed not after their departure longer than de
<lb/>cency required; for too much in earnest was his pre

<lb/>house in <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s abscence could afford him.</p></div>

<lb/>quitting the breakfast room, when they were stopt

<p>	  <lb/>The surprise which the sight of him gave to <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Monckton</persName> was extreme:  he knew that he was un
<lb/>acquainted with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, for he remembered they
<lb/>were strangers to each other when they lately met at
<lb/>his house; he concluded, therefore, that <persName>Cecilia</persName> was
<lb/>the object of his visit, but he could frame no con
<lb/>jecture under what pretence.</p>
<p><lb/>The easy terms upon which he seemed with all the
<lb/>family, by no means diminished his amazement; for
<lb/>when <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> expressed some concern that she
<lb/>was obliged to go out, he gaily begged her not to
<lb/>mind him, assuring her he could not have stayed two
<lb/>minutes, and promising, unasked, to call again the
<lb/>next day:  and when she added, <q id="q272" next="q273">We would not

<lb/>of the Opera,</q> he exclaimed with quickness, <q id="q273" prev="q272">A

<p><lb/>Then, perceiving <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, he bowed to

<lb/>she was perfectly recovered from her late indisposi

<p><lb/>The rehearsal was not begun, and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> and
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> secured
<lb/>themselves a box upon the stage,
<lb/>from which the gentlemen of their party took care
<lb/>not to be very distant.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>They were soon perceived by <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, who

	  <lb/><persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, who with some other ladies came

<lb/>and nod, with her usual readiness, at <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/>but took not any notice of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, though she made

<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> made not any other return to her

<lb/>and yawning:  <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, therefore, seizing the

<p><lb/><q id="q296" next="q297">Your assurance,</q> cried he, <q id="q297" prev="q296">carries conviction

<p><lb/><q id="q298" next="q299">O, was that all,</q> cried she, disappointed; <q id="q299" prev="q298">I

<p><lb/><q>What festino?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Well, only conceive how provoking!Why, I

<lb/>is not two minutes since I saw you fling the gauntlet
<lb/>at <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, and yet you are already prepared
<lb/>for another antagonist.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O as to <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I must really beg you not
<lb/>to mention her; she has behaved so impertinently,
<lb/>that I don't ever intend to speak to her again.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why, what has she done?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O she's been so rude you've no notion.  I'll tell
	    <lb/>you how it was.  You must know I met her at <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Harrel's</persName> the day she came to town, and the very next
<lb/>morning I waited on her myself, for I would not send
<lb/>a ticket, because I really wished to be civil to her;
<lb/>well, the day after, she never came near me, though
<lb/>I called upon her again; however, I did not take any
<lb/>notice of that; but when the third day came, and I
<lb/>found she had not even sent me a ticket, I thought
<lb/>it monstrous ill bred indeed; and now there has past
<lb/>more than a week, and yet she has never called:  so I
<lb/>suppose she don't like me; so I shall drop her ac

<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, satisfied now with the subject of her

<p><lb/><q id="q300" next="q301">I am glad, at least, to know my crime,</q> said

<p>
<lb/><q>O that's nothing at all to the purpose; you
<lb/>should have waited upon her, or sent her a ticket,
<lb/>just the same as if you had not seen her.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The overture was now begun, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> declined
<lb/>any further conversation.  This was the first Opera
<lb/>she had ever heard, yet she was not wholly a stranger
<lb/>to Italian compositions, having assiduously studied
<lb/>music from a natural love of the art, attended all the
<lb/>best concerts her neighbourhood afforded, and re
	  <lb/>gularly received from <placeName>London</placeName> the works of the best
<lb/>masters.  But the little skill she had thus gained,
<lb/>served rather to increase than to lessen the surprise
<lb/>with which she heard the present performancea sur
<lb/>prise of which the discovery of her own ignorance
<lb/>made not the least part.  Unconscious from the little
<lb/>she had acquired, how much was to be learnt, she was
<lb/>astonished to find the inadequate power of written
<lb/>music to convey any idea of vocal abilities:  with
<lb/>just knowledge enough, therefore, to understand
<lb/>something of the difficulties, and feel much of the
<lb/>merit, she gave to the whole Opera an avidity of at
<lb/>tention almost painful from its own eagerness.</p>
<p><lb/>But both the surprise and pleasure which she
<lb/>received from the performance in general, were faint,
<lb/>cold, and languid, compared to the strength of those
	  <lb/>emotions when excited by <persName>Signore Pacchierotti</persName> in
<lb/>particular; and though not half the excellencies of
<lb/>that superior singer were necessary either to amaze
<lb/>or charm her unaccustomed ears, though the refine
<lb/>ment of his taste and masterly originality of his
<lb/>genius, to be praised as they deserved, called for the
<lb/>judgement and knowledge of professors, yet a natural
<lb/>love of music in some measure supplied the place of
<pb n="089"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="L3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">85</mw>
<lb/>cultivation, and what she could neither explain nor
<lb/>understand, she could feel and enjoy.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The opera was <title>Artaserse</title>; and the pleasure she
<lb/>received from the music was much augmented by her
<lb/>previous acquaintance with that interesting drama;
<lb/>yet, as to all noviciates in science, whatever is least
<lb/>complicated is most pleasing, she found herself by
<lb/>nothing so deeply impressed, as by the plaintive and
	  <lb/>beautiful simplicity with which <persName>Pacchierotti</persName> uttered
<lb/>the affecting repetition of <foreign lang="ita">sono innocente!</foreign>  his voice,
<lb/>always wither sweet or impassioned, delivered those
<lb/>words in a tone of softness, pathos, and sensibility,
<lb/>that struck her with a sensation not more new than
<lb/>delightful.</p>
<p><lb/>But though she was, perhaps, the only person
<lb/>thus astonished, she was by no means the only one en
<lb/>raptured; for notwithstanding she was too earnestly
<lb/>engaged to remark the company in general, she could
<lb/>not avoid taking notice of an old gentleman who
<lb/>stood by one of the side scenes, against which he
<lb/>leant his head in a manner that concealed his face,
<lb/>with an evident design to be wholly absorbed in
	  <lb/>listening:  and during the songs of <persName>Pacchierotti</persName> he
<lb/>sighed so deeply, that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, struck by his uncom
<lb/>mon sensibility to the power of music, involuntarily
<lb/>watched him, whenever her mind was sufficiently at
<lb/>liberty to attend to any emotions but its own.</p>
<p><lb/>As soon as the rehearsal was over, the gentlemen
<lb/>of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s party crowded before her box; and
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then perceived that the person whose musical
<lb/>enthusiasm had excited her curiosity, was the same
<lb/>old gentleman whose extraordinary behaviour had so
<lb/>much surprised her at the house of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.

<lb/>Her desire to obtain some information concerning

<p><lb/>That gentleman, advancing to her with a smile of
<lb/>the extremest self-complacency, after hoping, in a

<lb/>himself into all parties, he associates with none:  he
<lb/>is commonly a stern and silent observer of all
<lb/>that passes, or when he speaks, it is but to utter
<lb/>some sentence of rigid morality, or some bitterness
<lb/>of indignant reproof.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/>The carriage was now again announced, and <persName>Mr.

	  <lb/>secured to himself the honour of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s, <persName>Sir

<lb/>parted.  But though they had now quitted the stage,
<lb/>and arrived at the head of a small stair-case by which
	  <lb/>they were to descend out of the theatre, <persName>Mr. Monck
	    <lb/>ton</persName>, finding all his tormentors retired, except <persName>Mr.

<lb/>making one more attempt for a few moments con

<lb/>Here a loud scream from <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> interrupted
<lb/>his speech; <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much alarmed, turned from him
<lb/>to enquire the cause, and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> was obliged
<lb/>to follow her example:  but his mortification was
<lb/>almost intolerable when he saw that lady in a violent

<lb/>at present the alteration in her way of life she had

<lb/>assume no singularity, till her independency should
<lb/>enable her to support it with consistency; yet greater
<lb/>than ever was her internal eagerness to better satisfy
<lb/>her inclination and her conscience in the disposition
<lb/>of her time, and the distribution of her wealth,
<lb/>since she had heard the emphatic charge of her un
<lb/>known Mentor.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> declined accompanying her in this visit,
<lb/>because she had appointed a surveyor to bring a
<lb/>plan for the inspection of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and herself, of
	  <lb/>a small temporary building, to be erected at <placeName>Violet-
<lb/>Bank</placeName>, for the purpose of performing plays in private
<lb/>the ensuing Easter.</p>
<p><lb/>When the street door was opened for her to get
<lb/>into the carriage, she was struck with the appearance
<lb/>of an elderly woman who was standing at some dis
<lb/>tance, and seemed shivering with cold, and who, as
<lb/>she descended the steps, joined her hands in an act of
<lb/>supplication, and advanced nearer to the carriage.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> stopt to look at her:  her dress, though par
<lb/>simonious, was too neat for a beggar; and she con
<lb/>sidered a moment what she could offer her.  The
<lb/>poor woman continued to move forward, but with a
<lb/>slowness of pace that indicated extreme weakness;
<lb/>and, as she approached and raised her head, she ex
<lb/>hibited a countenance so wretched, and a complexion
<lb/>so sickly, that <persName>Cecilia</persName> was impressed with horror at
<lb/>the sight.</p>
<p><lb/>With her hands still joined, and a voice that
<lb/>seemed fearful of its own sound, <q id="q346" next="q347">Oh, madam,</q>

<lb/>assist you?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q350" next="q351">Heaven bless you for speaking so kindly, ma

<lb/><q id="q351" prev="q350">I was sadly afraid you would be angry, but I saw
<lb/>the carriage at the door, and I thought I would try;
<lb/>for I could be no worse; and distress, madam, makes

<p><lb/><q id="q352" next="q353">Angry!</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, taking a crown from her

<p><lb/><q id="q354" next="q355">Oh, madam,</q> returned the poor woman, <q id="q355" prev="q354">I

<p><lb/><q>Have you, then, lost a son?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, madam; but he was a great deal too good

<p><lb/>She then gave orders that the carriage should be

<lb/>to know what she should do for her:  changing, while

<lb/><q>'Tis a bill, madam, for very hard work, for work,

<lb/>and day to get it, and sent him letters and petitions
<lb/>with an account of our misfortunes, I have never

<lb/>Oh madam! you who seem so good, plead to his ho

<p><lb/><q id="q369" next="q370">Impossible!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q370" prev="q369">he cannot know it;

<p><lb/><q>What, no more?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Ah madam, you gentlefolks little think how much

<lb/>Away she flew, and returned to the breakfast room,
<lb/>but found there only <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who told her that
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was in the library, with his sister and
<lb/>some gentlemen.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> briefly related her business,
<lb/>and begged he would inform <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> she wished
<lb/>to speak to him directly.  <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> shook his head,
<lb/>but obeyed.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>They returned together, and immediately, <q><persName>Miss
<lb/>Beverley</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, gaily, <q>I am glad you
<lb/>are not gone, for we want much to consult with you.
<lb/>Will you come upstairs?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q373" next="q374">Presently,</q> answered she; <q id="q374" prev="q373">but first I must
<lb/>speak to you about a poor woman with whom I have
<lb/>accidentally been talking, who has begged me to inter
<lb/>cede with you to pay a little debt she thinks you
<lb/>have forgotten, but that probably you have never
<lb/>heard mentioned.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q375" next="q376">A debt,</q> cried he, with an immediate change of

<lb/>directly.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Pho, pho, there's no such hurry; I don't know
<lb/>what I have done with her bill.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I'll run and get another.</q></p>

<lb/>month for her impertinence in troubling you at all
<lb/>about it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>That was entirely accidental:  but indeed you
<lb/>must give me leave to perform my promise and plead
<lb/>for her.  It must be almost the same to you whether
<lb/>you pay such a trifle as twenty pounds now, or a
<lb/>month hence; and to this poor woman, the difference
<lb/>seems little short of life or death; for she tells me
<lb/>her husband is dying, and her children half famished,
<lb/>and though she looks an object of the cruellest want
<lb/>and distress herself, she appears to be their only
<lb/>support.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q377" next="q378">O,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, laughing, <q id="q378" prev="q377">what a dismal
<lb/>tale she has been telling you! no doubt she saw you
<lb/>were fresh from the country!  But if you give credit
<lb/>to all the farragos of these trumpery impostors, you
<lb/>will never have a moment to yourself, nor a guinea in
<lb/>your purse.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q379" next="q380">This woman,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q380" prev="q379">cannot be an

<p><lb/><q id="q381" next="q382">O,</q> returned he, <q id="q382" prev="q381">when you know the town
<lb/>better, you will soon see through tricks of this
<lb/>sort; a sick husband and five small children are com
<lb/>plaints so stale now, that they serve no other purpose
<lb/>in the world but to make a joke.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Those, however, who can laugh at them, must
<lb/>have notions of merriment very different to mine.
<lb/>And this poor woman, whose cause I have ventured
<lb/>to undertake, had she no family at all, must still and
<lb/>indisputably be an object of pity herself, for she is so

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">99</mw>
<lb/>weak she can hardly crawl, and so palid, that she
<lb/>seems already half dead.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>All imposition, depend upon it!  The moment
<lb/>she is out of your sight, her complaints will vanish.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q383" next="q384">Nay, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, a little impatiently,
<lb/><q id="q384" prev="q383">there is no reason to suspect such deceit, since she
<lb/>does not come hither as a beggar, however well the
<lb/>state of beggary may accord with her poverty:  she
<lb/>only solicits the payment of a bill; and if in that there
<lb/>is any fraud, nothing can be so easy as detection.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> bit his lips at this speech, and for some
<lb/>instants looked much disturbed; but soon recovering
<lb/>himself, he negligently said, <q>Pray how did she get
<lb/>at you?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I met her at the street-door.  But tell me, is not
<lb/>her bill a just one?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I cannot say; I have never had time to look
<lb/>at it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But you know who the woman is, and that her
<lb/>husband worked for you, and therefore that in all pro
<lb/>bability it is rightdo you not?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, yes, I know who the woman is well enough;
<lb/>she has taken care of that, for she has pestered me
<lb/>every day these nine months.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was struck dumb by this speech:  hitherto
<lb/>she had supposed that the dissipation of his life kept
<lb/>him ignorant of his own injustice; but when she found
<lb/>he was so well informed of it, yet, with such total in
<lb/>difference, could suffer a poor woman to claim a just
<lb/>debt every day for nine months together, she was
<lb/>shocked and astonished beyond measure.  They were

<lb/>and
<lb/>stretching out his arms, indolently asked, <q>Pray

<p><lb/><q id="q385" next="q386">Did I not tell you,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, staring at
<lb/>so absent a question, <q id="q386" prev="q385">that he was very ill, and un
<lb/>able even to work?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q387" next="q388">Well, when he is better,</q> added he, moving to
<lb/>wards the door, <q id="q388" prev="q387">he may call, and I will talk to
<lb/>him.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, all amazement at this unfeeling behaviour,
<lb/>turned involuntarily to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, with a counte
	  <lb/>nance that appealed for his assistance; but <persName>Mr. Ar
<lb/>nott</persName> hung his head, ashamed to meet her eyes, and
<lb/>abruptly left the room.</p>
<p><lb/>Mean time <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, half turning back, though
<lb/>without looking <persName>Cecilia</persName> in the face, carelessly said,
<lb/><q>Well, won't you come?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, Sir,</q> answered she, coldly.</p>
<p><lb/>He then returned to the library, leaving her equal
<lb/>ly displeased, surprised, and disconcerted at the con
<lb/>versation which had just past between them.  <q id="q389" next="q390">Good
<lb/>heaven,</q> cried she to herself, <q id="q390" prev="q389">what strange, what

<lb/>starve, from an obstinate determination to assert that
<lb/>they can live! to distress the poor by retaining the

<lb/>at last they must have, merely from indolence, forget
<lb/>fullness, or insolence!  O how little did my uncle
<lb/>know, how little did I imagine to what a guardian I

<lb/>But before she had quitted the room, one of the
<lb/>servants came to tell her that his master begged the
<lb/>honour of her company up stairs.  <q>Perhaps he re
<lb/>lents!</q> thought she; and pleased with the hope,
<lb/>readily obeyed the summons.</p>
<p><lb/>She found him, his lady, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, and
<lb/>two other gentlemen, all earnestly engaged in an ar
<lb/>gument over a large table, which was covered with
<lb/>plans and elevations of small buildings.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> immediately addressed her with an air
<lb/>of vivacity, and said, <q>You are very good for coming;
<lb/>we can settle nothing without your advice; pray look
<lb/>at these different plans for our theatre, and tell us
<lb/>which is the best.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> advanced not a step:  the sight of plans for
<lb/>new edifices when the workmen were yet unpaid for
<lb/>old ones, the cruel wantonness of raising fresh fabrics
<lb/>of expensive luxury, while those so lately built had
<lb/>brought their neglected labourers to ruin, excited an
<lb/>indignation she scarce thought right to repress:  while
<lb/>the easy sprightliness of the director of these revels,
<lb/>to whom but the moment before she had represented
<lb/>the oppression of which they made him guilty, filled
<lb/>her with aversion and disgust:  and recollecting the
<lb/>charge given her by the stranger at the Opera rehear
<lb/>sal, she resolved to speed her departure to another
<lb/>house, internally repeating, <q>Yes, I <emph>will</emph> save myself
<lb/>from <emph>the impending destruction of unfeeling pros
<lb/>perity!</emph></q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, surprised at her silence and extreme

<lb/><q>Do you begin to feel the London air already?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> endeavoured to recover her serenity, and
<lb/>answer these questions in her usual manner; but she
<lb/>persisted in declining to give any opinion at all about
<lb/>the plans, and, after slightly looking at them, left the
<lb/>room.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who knew better how to account for
<lb/>her behaviour than he thought proper to declare, saw
<lb/>with concern that she was more seriously displeased,
<lb/>than he had believed an occurrence which he had re

<lb/>and therefore desirous that she should be appeased,

<p><lb/><q>O yes, no doubt!</q> answered she, most agreeably

<p><lb/><q>Well, then, will you take the trouble to bid her
<lb/>come to me in the morning?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Delighted at this unexpected commission, she
<lb/>thanked him with smiles for the office; and as she
<lb/>hastened down stairs to cheer the poor expectant with
<lb/>the welcome intelligence, she framed a thousand ex
<lb/>cuses for the part he had hitherto acted, and without
<lb/>any difficulty, persuaded herself he began to see the
<lb/>faults of his conduct, and to mediate a reformation.</p>
<p><lb/>She was received by the poor creature she so warm
<lb/>ly wished to serve with a countenance already so much
<lb/>enlivened, that she fancied <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had himself
<lb/>anticipated her intended information:  this, however,
<lb/>she found was not the case, for as soon as she heard

<lb/>his message, she shook her head and said, <q>Ah, ma
<lb/>dam, his honour always says to-morrow! but I can
<lb/>better bear to be disappointed now, so I'll grumble no
<lb/>more; for, indeed, madam, I have been blest enough
<lb/>to-day to comfort me for every thing in the world, if
<lb/>I could but keep from thinking of poor Billy!  I could
<lb/>bear all the rest, madam, but whenever my other
<lb/>troubles go off, that comes back to me so much the
<lb/>harder!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q391" next="q392">There, indeed, I can afford you no relief,</q> said
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q392" prev="q391">but you must try to think less of him, and
<lb/>more of your husband and children who are now
<lb/>alive.  To-morrow you will receive your money, and
<lb/>that, I hope will raise your spirits.  And pray let
<lb/>your husband have a physician, to tell you how to
<lb/>nurse and manage him; I will give you one fee for
<lb/>him now, and if he should want further advice, don't
<lb/>fear to let me know.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> had again taken out her purse, but <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Hill</persName>, clasping her hands, called out, <q>Oh madam,
<lb/>no!  I don't come here to fleece such goodness! but
<lb/>blessed be the hour that brought me here to day, and
	    <lb/>if my poor <persName>Billy</persName> was alive, he should help me to thank
<lb/>you!</q></p>
<p><lb/>She then told her that she was now quite rich, for
<lb/>while she was gone, a gentleman had come into the
<lb/>room who had given her five guineas.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, by her description, soon found this gentle
<lb/>man was <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and a charity so sympathetic
<lb/>with her own, failed not to raise him greatly in her
<lb/>favour.  But as her benevolence was a stranger to
<lb/>that parade which is only liberal from emulation,

<lb/>enquire for her the next morning when she came to
<lb/>be paid, bid her hasten back to her sick husband.</p>
<p><lb/>And then, again ordering the carriage to the door,
<lb/>she set off upon her visit to <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, with a
<lb/>heart happy in the good already done, and happier
<lb/>still in the hope of doing more.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> was out, and she returned home;
<lb/>for she was too sanguine in her expectations from
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, to have any desire of seeking her other
<lb/>guardians.  The rest of the day she was more than
<lb/>usually civil to him, with a view to mark her approba
<lb/>tion of his good intentions; while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, grati
<lb/>fied by meeting the smiles he so much valued, thought
<lb/>his five guineas amply repaid, independently of the

        <p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> happened to be engaged, and there

        <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who had heard this proposal with

            <lb/>ing his house.  But while this somewhat alarmed him,
            <lb/>the unabated insolence of his carriage, and the con
            <lb/>fident defiance of his pride, still more surprised him;

            <lb/>seemed to promise nothing but dislike, he could draw
            <lb/>no other inference from his behaviour, than that if he

        <p><lb/>This was not a pleasant conjecture, however little
            <lb/>weight he allowed to it; and he resolved, by out

            <lb/>private discourse with her upon the subject.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/>In about half an hour, <persName>Sir Robert</persName> and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>

            <lb/>in keeping his ground, and tried, though already
            <lb/>weary, to keep up a general conversation; but what
            <lb/>moved at once his wonder and his indignation was
            <lb/>the assurance of <persName>Morrice</persName>, who seemed not only bent
            <lb/>upon staying as long as himself, but determined, by
            <lb/>rattling away, to make his own entertainment.</p>
        <p><lb/>At length a servant came in to tell <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>
            <lb/>that a stranger, who was waiting in the house
            <lb/>keeper's room, begged to speak with her upon

            <lb/>removal of all the obstacles in its way, and then to
            <lb/>have it held from him by a young fellow he so much

            <lb/>him so insufferably, that it was with difficulty he even

            <lb/>for <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
        <p><lb/>He arose, however, and was moving towards her,
            <lb/>with the intention to occupy a part of a sofa on which
            <lb/>she was seated, when <persName>Morrice</persName>, who was standing at the
            <lb/>back of it, with a sudden spring which made the
            <lb/>whole room shake, jumpt over, and sunk plump into
            <lb/>the vacant place himself, calling out at the same
            <lb/>time.  <q>Come, come, what have you married men to
                <lb/>do with young ladies?  I shall seize this post for
                <lb/>myself.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>The rage of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> at this feat, and still
            <lb/>more at the words <emph>married men,</emph> almost exceeded
            <lb/>endurance; he stopt short, and looking at him with a
            <lb/>fierceness that overpowered his discretion, was burst
            <lb/>ing out with, <q id="q426" next="q427">Sir you are an<emph>impudent fellow;</emph></q>
            <lb/>but checking himself when he got half way, con

            <lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, and whose behaviour was merely the
            <lb/>result of levity, and a want of early education, no
            <lb/>sooner perceived his displeasure, than rising with
            <lb/>yet more agility than he had seated himself, he re
            <lb/>sumed the obsequiousness of which an uncommon
            <lb/>flow of spirits had robbed him, and guessing no other
            <lb/>subject for his anger than the disturbance he had
            <lb/>made, he bowed almost to the ground, first to him, and
            <lb/>afterwards to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, most respectfully begging
            <lb/>pardon of them both for his frolic, and protesting he

<lb/>call upon her as soon as she was at leisure.  The ac
<lb/>count which he brought back increased her concern
<lb/>for the injuries of these poor people, and determined
<lb/>her not to rest till she saw them redressed.  He
<lb/>informed her that they lived in a small lodging up
<lb/>two pair of stairs; that there were five children, all
<lb/>girls, the three eldest of whom were hard at work
<lb/>with their mother in matting chair-bottoms, and the
<lb/>fourth, though a mere child, was nursing the youngest;
<lb/>while the poor carpenter himself was confined to his
<lb/>bed, in consequence of a fall from a ladder while
<lb/>working at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName>, by which he was covered
<lb/>with wounds and contusions, and an object of misery
<lb/>and pain.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>As soon as <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> came, <persName>Cecilia</persName> sent for her into

<lb/>make enemies; but indeed, madam, his honour was

<lb/>you would be angry, I could not tell how to bear it;
<lb/>for when I told him I had no help now, for I had lost

<lb/>this unfeeling speech, <q id="q431" prev="q430">is the reason he gives for
<lb/>disappointing you so often?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>He says, madam, that none of the other work
<lb/>men are paid yet; and that, to be sure, is very true;
<lb/>but then they can all better afford to wait than we can,
<lb/>for we were the poorest of all, madam, and have
<lb/>been misfortunate from the beginning; and his ho
<lb/>nour would never have employed us, only he had run
	    <lb/>up such a bill with <persName>Mr. Wright</persName>, that he would not
<lb/>undertake any thing more till he was paid.  We were
<lb/>told from the first we should not get our money; but
<lb/>we were willing to hope for the best, for we had no
<lb/>thing to do, and were hard run, and had never had
<lb/>the offer of so good a job before; and we had a
<lb/>great family to keep, and many losses, and so much
<lb/>illness!Oh madam! if you did but know
<lb/>what the poor go through!</q></p>
<p><lb/>This speech opened to <persName>Cecilia</persName> a new view of life;
<lb/>that a young man could appear so gay and happy, yet
<lb/>be guilty of such injustice and inhumanity; that he
<lb/>could take pride in works which not even money had
<lb/>made his own, and live with undiminished splendor,
<lb/>when his credit itself began to fail, seemed to her in
<lb/>congruities so irrational, that hitherto she had sup
<lb/>posed them impossible.</p>
<p><lb/>She then enquired if her husband had yet had any
<lb/>physician?</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q432" next="q433">Yes, madam, I humbly thank your goodness,</q>

<lb/><q>He says he must die, madam! but I knew that
<lb/>before.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Poor woman! and what will you do then?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>The same, madam, as I did when I lost my Billy,
<lb/>work on the harder!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Good heaven, how severe a lot! but tell me, why
	    <lb/>is it you seem to love your <persName>Billy</persName> so much better than
<lb/>the rest of your children!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Because, madam, he was the only boy that ever I
<lb/>had; he was seventeen years old, madam, and as tall
<lb/>and as pretty a lad! and so good, that he never cost
<lb/>me a wet eye till I lost him.  He worked with his fa
<lb/>ther, and all the folks used to say he was the better
<lb/>workman of the two.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And what was the occasion of his death?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>A consumption, madam, that wasted him quite to
<lb/>nothing; and he was ill a long time, and cost us a
<lb/>deal of money, for we spared neither for wine nor any
<lb/>thing, that we thought would but comfort him; and
<lb/>we loved him so we never grudged it.  But he died,
<lb/>madam! and if it had not been for very hard work,
<lb/>the loss of him would quite have broke my heart.</q></p>

<p><lb/><q id="q436" next="q437"><emph>I</emph> will!</q> cried the generous <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<q id="q437" prev="q436">I am able,
<lb/>and I am willing; you shall not find all the rich hard
<lb/>hearted, and I will try to make you some amends for
<lb/>the unkindness you have suffered.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The poor woman, overcome by a promise so unex
<lb/>pected, burst into a passionate fit of tears, and sobbed
<lb/>out her thanks with a violence of emotion that fright
<lb/>ened <persName>Cecilia</persName> almost as much as it melted her.  She
<lb/>endeavoured, by reiterated assurances of assistance,
<lb/>to appease her, and solemnly pledged her own honour
<lb/>that she should certainly be paid the following Satur
<lb/>day, which was only three days distant.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> when a little calmer, dried her eyes, and
<lb/>humbly begging her to forgive a transport which she
<lb/>could not restrain, most gratefully thanked her for
<lb/>the engagement into which she had entered, protesting
<lb/>that she would not be <emph>troublesome to her goodness</emph> as
<lb/>long as she could help it: <q id="q438" next="q439">And I believe,</q> she con
<lb/>tinued, <q id="q439" prev="q438">that if his honour will but pay me time
<lb/>enough for the burial, I can make shift with what I

<lb/>were sadly off indeed, for we could not bear but bury
<lb/>him prettily, because it was the last we could do for
<lb/>him: but we could hardly scrape up enough for it,
<lb/>and yet we all went without our dinners to help for
<lb/>ward, except the little one of all.  But that did not
<lb/>much matter, for we had no great heart for eating.</q></p>

<p><lb/><q id="q442" next="q443">I will, madam,</q> answered the woman, <q id="q443" prev="q442">and his

<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> kindly endeavoured to soothe her, but the
<lb/>poor creature, no longer able to suppress the violence
<lb/>of her awakened sorrows, cried out, <q>I must go,
<lb/>madam, and pray for you at home, for now I have
<lb/>once begun crying again, I don't know how to have
<lb/>done!</q> and hurried away.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> determined to make once more an effort with
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> for the payment of the bill, and if that, in
<lb/>two days, did not succeed, to take up money for the
<lb/>discharge of it herself, and rest all her security for re
<lb/>imbursement upon the shame with which such a pro
<lb/>ceeding must overwhelm him.  Offended, however,
<lb/>by the repulse she had already received from him,
<lb/>and disgusted by all that she had heard of his un
<lb/>feeling negligence, she knew not how to address him,
<lb/>and resolved upon applying again to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who
<lb/>was already acquianted with the affair, for advice and
<lb/>assistance.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, though extremely gratified that she
<lb/>consulted him, betrayed by his looks an hopelessness
<lb/>of success that damped all her expectations.  He pro
<lb/>mised, however, to speak to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> upon the sub
<lb/>ject, but the promise was evidently given to oblige
<lb/>the fair mediatrix, without any hope of advantage to
<lb/>the cause.</p>

<p>
	  <lb/>The next morning <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> again came, and again
<lb/>without payment was dismissed.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> then, at the request of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, followed
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> into his room, to enquire into the reason
<lb/>of this breach of promise; they continued some time
<lb/>together, and when he returned to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he told
<lb/>her, that his brother had assured him he would give
	  <lb/>orders to <persName>Davison</persName>, his gentleman, to let her have the
<lb/>money the next day.</p>
<p><lb/>The pleasure with which she would have heard this
<lb/>intelligence was much checked by the grave and cold
<lb/>manner in which it was communicated: she waited,
<lb/>therefore, with more impatience than confidence for
<lb/>the result of this fresh assurance.</p>
<p><lb/>The next morning, however, was the same as the
	  <lb/>last; <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> came, saw <persName>Davison</persName>, and was sent
<lb/>away.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whom she related her grievances, then
<lb/>flew to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and entreated him to enquire at
<lb/>least of Davison why the woman had again been dis
<lb/>appointed.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> obeyed her, and brought for answer,
	  <lb/>that <persName>Davison</persName> had received no orders from his master.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q444" next="q445">I entreat you then,</q> cried she, with mingled ea
	  <lb/>gerness and vexation, <q id="q445" prev="q444">to go, for the last time, to <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel</persName>.  I am sorry to impose upon you an office so

<lb/>terest, as you have already done with your purse.  I
<lb/>only wish to know if there has been any mistake, or if
<lb/>these delays are merely to sicken me of petitioning.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, with a repugnance to the request
<lb/>which he could as ill conceal as his admiration of the

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">118</mw>
	  <lb/>zealous requester, again forced him to follow <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel</persName>.  His stay was not long, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> at his re
<lb/>turn perceived that he was hurt and disconcerted.  As
<lb/>soon as they were alone together, she begged to know
<lb/>what had passed?  <q id="q446" next="q447">Nothing,</q> answered he, <q id="q447" prev="q446">that
<lb/>will give you any pleasure.  When I entreated my
<lb/>brother to come to the point, he said it was his inten
<lb/>tion to pay all his workmen together, for that if he paid
<lb/>any one singly, all the rest would be dissatisfied.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q448" next="q449">And why,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q449" prev="q448">should he not pay them
<lb/>at once?  There can be no more comparison in the
<lb/>value of the money to him and to them, than, to speak
<lb/>with truth, there is in his and in their right to it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But, madam, the bills for the new house itself are
<lb/>none of them settled, and he says that the moment he
<lb/>is known to discharge an account for the Temple, he
<lb/>shall not have any rest for the clamours it will raise
<lb/>among the workmen who were employed about the
<lb/>house.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q450" next="q451">How infinitely strange!</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q451" prev="q450">will
<lb/>he not, then, pay any body?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Next quarter, he says, he shall pay them all, but,
<lb/>at present, he has a particular call for his money.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> would not trust herself to make any com
<lb/>ments upon such an avowal, but, thanking <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb/>for the trouble which he had taken, she determined,
<lb/>without any further application, to desire <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb/>to advance her 20<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. the next morning, and satisfy the
<lb/>carpenter herself, be the risk what it might.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The following day, therefore, which was the <name>Satur
<lb/>day</name> when payment was promised, she begged an au
<lb/>dience of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, which he immediately granted;
<lb/>but before she could make her demand, he said to her,

<lb/>with an air of the utmost gaiety and good-humour,

<lb/>gee?</foreign></q>  I hope, at length, she is contented.  But I
<lb/>must beg you would charge her to keep her own coun

<p><lb/><q>Have you then paid her?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName> with
<lb/>much amazement.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes; I promised you I would, you know.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This intelligence equally delighted and astonished
<lb/>her; she repeatedly thanked him for his attention to
<lb/>her petition, and, eager to communicate her success to
<lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, she hastened to find him.  <q id="q452" next="q453">Now,</q> cried
<lb/>she, <q id="q453" prev="q452">I shall torment you no more with painful com

<p><lb/><q id="q456" next="q457">Well but,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, somewhat disappointed,

<lb/>very glad to see you so.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But how was it brought about? did <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb/>relent? or did you attack him again?</q></p>
<p><lb/>The hesitation of his answer convinced her there
<lb/>was some mystery in the transaction; she began to
<lb/>apprehend she had been deceived, and hastily quit
	  <lb/>ting the room, sent for <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>; but the moment
<lb/>the poor woman appeared, she was satisfied of the
<lb/>contrary, for, almost frantic with joy and gratitude,
<lb/>she immediately flung herself upon her knees, to

<lb/>her he had already been in one many months, where
<lb/>he was pronounced incurable, and was therefore de

<p><lb/>She then, still greatly perplexed about <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb/>sought him again, and, after various questions and
<lb/>conjectures, at length brought him to confess he had

<lb/>had been paid.</p>
<p><lb/>Struck with his generosity, she poured forth thanks

        <p><lb/>For this purpose, she borrowed one of the car
            <lb/>riages, and gave orders to be driven into the city, to
            <lb/>the house of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>.</p>
        <p><lb/>She told her name, and was shewn, by a little
            <lb/>shabby foot-boy, into a parlour.</p>
        <p><lb/>Here she waited, with tolerable patience, for half
            <lb/>an hour, but then, imagining the boy had forgotten
            <lb/>to tell his master she was in the house, she thought it
            <lb/>expedient to make some enquiry.</p>
        <p><lb/>No bell, however, could she find, and therefore she
            <lb/>went into the passage in search of the foot-boy; but
            <lb/>as she was proceeding to the head of the kitchen
            <lb/>stairs, she was startled by hearing a man's voice from
            <lb/>the upper part of the house, exclaiming, in a furious
            <lb/>passion, <q>Dare say you have filched it for a dish
                <lb/>clout!</q></p>
        <p>	  <lb/>She called out, however, <q>Are any of <persName>Mr. Brigg's</persName>
            <lb/>servant's below?</q></p>
        <p>	  <lb/><q><persName>Anan</persName>!</q> answered the boy, who came to the foot
            <lb/>of the stairs with a knife in one hand, and an old
            <lb/>shoe, upon the sole of which he was sharpening it, in
            <lb/>the other, <q>Does any one call?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q462" next="q463">Yes,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q463" prev="q462">I do; for I could not find
            <lb/>the bell.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q464" next="q465">O, we have no bell in the parlour,</q> returned the
            <lb/>boy, <q id="q465" prev="q464">master always knocks with his stick.</q></p>
        <p>	  <lb/><q>I am afraid <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> is too busy to see me, and
            <lb/>if so, I will come another time.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q467" next="q468">No, ma'am,</q> said the boy, <q id="q468" prev="q467">master's only look
            <lb/>ing over his things from the wash.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Will you tell him, then, that I am waiting?</q></p>

            <lb/><q>I has, ma'am; but master misses his shaving rag,
                <lb/>and he says he won't come to the Mogul till he's
                <lb/>found it.</q>  And then he went on with sharpening his
            <lb/>knife.</p>
        <p><lb/>This little circumstance was at least sufficient to
            <lb/>satisfy <persName>Cecilia</persName> that if she fixed her abode with <persName>Mr.
                <lb/>Briggs</persName>, she should not have much uneasiness to fear
            <lb/>from the sight of extravagance and profusion.</p>
        <p><lb/>She returned to the parlour, and after waiting
            <lb/>another half hour, <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> made his appearance.
            <lb/><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> was a short, thick, sturdy man, with very
            <lb/>small keen black eyes, a square face, a dark com
            <lb/>plexion, and a snub nose.  His constant dress, both
            <lb/>in winter and summer, was a snuff-colour suit of
            <lb/>cloaths, blue and white speckled worsted stockings, a
            <lb/>plain shirt, and a bob wig.  He was seldom without
            <lb/>a stick in his hand, which he usually held to his fore
            <lb/>head when not speaking.</p>
        <p><lb/>This bob wig, however, to the no small amaze
            <lb/>ment of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he now brought into the room upon
            <lb/>the forefinger of his left-hand, while, with his right,
            <lb/>he was smoothing the curls; and his head, in defiance
            <lb/>of the coldness of the weather, was bald and un
            <lb/>covered.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q469" next="q470">Well,</q> cried he, as he entered, <q id="q470" prev="q469">did you think
            <lb/>should not come?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>I was very willing, Sir, to wait your leisure.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Ay, ay, knew you had not much to do.  Been
            <lb/>looking for my shaving-rag.  Going out of town;
            <lb/>never use such a thing at home, paper does as well.
            <lb/>Warrant master <persName>Harrel</persName> never heard of such a thing;
            <lb/>ever see him comb his own wig?  Warrant he don't

            <lb/>boy would tear off half the hair; all one to master
            <lb/><persName>Harrel</persName>, I suppose.  Well, which is the warmer man,
            <lb/>that's all?  Will he cast an account with me?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, at a loss what to say to this singular exor
            <lb/>dium, began an apology for not waiting upon him
            <lb/>sooner.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q471" next="q472">Ay, ay,</q> cried he, <q id="q472" prev="q471">always gadding, no getting
            <lb/>sight of you.  Live a fine life!  A pretty guardian
            <lb/>master <persName>Harrel</persName>! and where's t'other? where's old

        <p>	  <lb/><q>If you mean <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, Sir, I have not yet seen
            <lb/>him.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Thought so.  No matter:  as well not.  Only tell
            <lb/>you he's a German Duke, or a Spanish <name>Don Fer
                <lb/>dinand</name>.  Well you've me! poorly off else.  A couple
            <lb/>of ignoramussus! don't know when to buy nor when
            <lb/>to sell.  No doing business with either of them.  We
            <lb/>met once or twice; all to no purpose; only heard
            <lb/><name>Don Vampus</name> count his old Grandees; how will that
            <lb/>get interest for money?  Then comes master <persName>Harrel</persName>,

            <lb/>about as big as a sixpence,poor raw ninny!a
            <lb/>couple of rare guardians!  Well you've me, I say;
            <lb/>mind that!</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was wholly unable to devise any answer to
            <lb/>these effusions of contempt and anger; and therefore
            <lb/>his harangue lasted without interruption, till he had
            <lb/>exhausted all his subjects of complaint, and emptied
            <lb/>his mind of ill-will; and then, settling his wig, he
            <lb/>drew a chair near her, and twinkling his little black
            <lb/>eyes in her face, his rage subsided into the most per
            <lb/>fect good-humour; and, after peeping at her some
            <lb/>time with a look of much approbation, he said, with

            <lb/>an arch nod, <q>Well, my duck, got ever a sweet
                <lb/>heart yet?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> laughed, and said <q>No.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Ah, little rogue, don't believe you! all a fib!
            <lb/>better speak out:  come, fit I should know; a'n't you
            <lb/>my own ward? to be sure almost of age, but not quite,
            <lb/>so what's that to me?</q></p>
        <p><lb/>She then, more seriously, assured him she had no
            <lb/>intelligence of that sort to communicate.</p>
        <p><lb/><q>Well, when you have, tell, that's all.  Warrant
            <lb/>sparks enough hankering.  I'll give you some advice.
            <lb/>Take care of sharpers; don't trust shoe-buckles, no
            <lb/>thing but Bristol stones! tricks in all things.  A fine
            <lb/>gentleman sharp as another man.  Never give your
            <lb/>heart to a gold-topped cane, nothing but brass gilt
            <lb/>over.  Cheats every where:  fleece you in a year;
            <lb/>won't leave you a groat.  But one way to be safe,
            <lb/>bring e'em all to me.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for his caution, and promised
            <lb/>not to forget his advice.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q473" next="q474">That's the way,</q> he continued, <q id="q474" prev="q473">bring 'em to me.
            <lb/>Won't be bamboozled.  Know their tricks.  Shew

        <p><lb/><q>Certainly, sir, that will be an excellent method of

        <p><lb/><q>Ay, ay, know the way! soon find if they are above

            <lb/>depart.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q475" next="q476">Well,</q> repeated he, nodding at her with a look
            <lb/>of much kindness, <q id="q476" prev="q475">leave it to me, I say; I'll get you
                <lb/>a careful husband, so take no thought about the mat
                <lb/>ter.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, half laughing, begged he would not give
            <lb/>himself much trouble, and assured him she was not in
            <lb/>any haste.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="q477" next="q478">All the better,</q> said he, <q id="q478" prev="q477">good girl; no fear for

        <p><lb/>She then returned to her carriage; full of reflection
            <lb/>upon the scene in which she had just been engaged,
            <lb/>and upon the strangeness of hastening from one house
            <lb/>to avoid a vice the very want of which seemed to ren
            <lb/>der another insupportable! but she now found that
            <lb/>though luxury was more baneful in its consequences,
            <lb/>it was less disgustful in its progress than avarice; yet,
            <lb/>insuperably averse to both, and almost equally desir
            <lb/>ous to fly from the unjust extravagance of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
            <lb/>as from the comfortless and unnecessary parsimony of
            <lb/><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, she proceeded instantly to <placeName>St. James's-
                <lb/>Square</placeName>, convinced that her third guardian, unless
            <lb/>exactly resembling one of the others, must inevitably
            <lb/>be preferable to both.</p>

	  <lb/><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> house of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> was grand and spacious,
<lb/>fitted up not with modern taste, but with the magni
<lb/>ficence of former times; the servants were all vete
<lb/>rans, gorgeous in their liveries, and profoundly res
<lb/>pectful in their manners; every thing had an air of
<lb/>state, but of a state so gloomy, that while it inspired
<lb/>awe, it repressed pleasure.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> sent in her name, and was admitted without
<lb/>difficulty, and was then ushed with great pomp through
<lb/>sundry apartments, and rows of servants, before she
	  <lb/>came into the presence of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>He received her with an air of haughty affability,
<lb/>which, to a spirit open and liberal as that of <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>could not fail being extremely offensive; but too much
<lb/>occupied with the care of his own importance to pene
<lb/>trate into the feelings of another, he attributed the
<lb/>uneasiness which his reception occasioned, to the over
<lb/>awing predominance of superior rank and conse
<lb/>quence.</p>
<p><lb/>He ordered a servant to bring her a chair, while
<lb/>he only half rose from his own upon her entering into
<lb/>the room; then, waving his hand and bowing, with a
<lb/>motion that desired her to be seated, he said, <q>I am
<lb/>very happy, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, that you have found me
<lb/>alone; you would rarely have had the same good
<lb/>fortune.  At this time of day I am generally in a
<pb n="131"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">127</mw>
<lb/>crowd. People of large connections have not much
<lb/>leisure in London, especially if they see a little after
<lb/>their own affairs, and if their estates, like mine, are
<lb/>dispersed in various parts of the kingdom.  However,
<lb/>I am glad it happened so.  And I am glad, too, that
<lb/>you have done me the favour of calling without wait
<lb/>ing till I sent, which I really would have done as soon
<lb/>as I heard of your arrival, but that the multiplicity of
<lb/>my engagements allowed me no respite.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/>A display of importance so ostentatious made <persName>Ce
<lb/>cilia</persName> already half repent her visit, satisfied that the
<lb/>hope in which she had planned it would be fruitless.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, still imputing to embarrassment, an
<lb/>inquietude of countenance that proceeded merely
<lb/>from disappointment, imagined her veneration was
<lb/>every moment encreasing; and therefore, pitying a
<lb/>timidity which both gratified and softened him, and
<lb/>equally pleased with himself for inspiring, and with
<lb/>her for feeling it, he abated more and more of his
<lb/>greatness, till he became, at length, so infinitely con
<lb/>descending, with intention to give her courage, that
<lb/>he totally depressed her with mortification and cha
<lb/>grin.</p>
<p><lb/>After some general enquiries concerning her way
<lb/>of life, he told her that he hoped she was contented
	  <lb/>with her situation at the <name>Harrels</name>, adding, <q>If you
<lb/>have any thing to complain of, remember to whom you
	    <lb/>may appeal.</q>  He then asked if she had seen <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Briggs</persName>?</p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, Sir, I am this moment come from his house.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am sorry for it; his house cannot be a proper
<lb/>one for the reception of a young lady.  When the
<lb/>Dean made application that I would be one of your
<pb n="132"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">128</mw>
<lb/>guardians, I instantly sent him a refusal, as is my cus
<lb/>tom upon all such occasions, which indeed occur to
<lb/>me with a frequency extremely importunate; but the
<lb/>Dean was a man for whom I had really a regard, and
<lb/>therefore, when I found my refusal had affected him,
<lb/>I suffered myself to be prevailed upon to indulge him,
<lb/>contrary not only to my general rule, but to my incli
<lb/>nation.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here he stopt, as if to receive some compliment;
<lb/>but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, very little disposed to pay him any, went
<lb/>no farther than an inclination of
<lb/>the head.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q479" next="q480">I knew not, however,</q> he continued, <q id="q480" prev="q479">at the
<lb/>time I was induced to give my consent, with whom I
<lb/>was to be associated; nor could I have imagined the
<lb/>Dean so little conversant with the distinctions of the
<lb/>world, as to disgrace me with inferior coadjutors; but
<lb/>the moment I learnt the state of the affair, I insisted
<lb/>upon withdrawing both my name and countenance.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here again he paused; not in expectation of an an
<lb/>swer from <persName>Cecilia</persName>, but merely to give her time to
<lb/>marvel in what manner he had at last been melted.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q481" next="q482">The Dean,</q> he resumed, <q id="q482" prev="q481">was then very ill; my
<lb/>displeasure, I believe, hurt him.  I was sorry for it;
<lb/>he was a worthy man, and had not meant to offend
<lb/>me; in the end I accepted his apology, and was even
<lb/>persuaded to accept the office.  You have a right,
<lb/>therefore, to consider yourself as <emph>personally</emph> my ward:
<lb/>and though I do not think proper to mix much with
<lb/>your other guardians, I shall always be ready to serve
<lb/>and advise you, and much pleased to see you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You do me honour, sir;</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely
<lb/>wearied of such graciousness, and rising to be gone.</p>

<lb/>not many engagements for this morning.  You must
<lb/>give me some account how you pass your time.  Are
<lb/>you much out?  The Harrels, I am told, live at a
<lb/>great expence.  What is their establishment?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I don't exactly know, sir.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>They are decent sort of people, I believe; are
<lb/>they not?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hope so, sir!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And they have a tolerable acquaintance, I believe:
<lb/>I am told so; for I know nothing of them.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>They have, at least, a very numerous one, sir.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q485" next="q486">Well, my dear,</q> said he, taking her hand, <q id="q486" prev="q485">now
<lb/>you have once ventured to come, don't be appre
<lb/>hensive of repeating your visits; I must introduce
	    <lb/>you to <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>; I am sure she will be happy to
<lb/>shew you any kindness.  Come, therefore, when you
<lb/>please, and without scruple.  I would call upon you
<lb/>myself, but am fearful of being embarrassed by the
<lb/>people with whom you live.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then rang his bell, and with the same ceremonies
<lb/>which had attended her admittance, she was conducted
<lb/>back to her carriage.</p>
<p><lb/>And here died away all hope of putting into exe
<lb/>cution, during her minority, the plan of which the
<lb/>formation had given her so much pleasure.  She
<lb/>found that her present situation, however wide of her
<lb/>wishes, was by no means the most disagreeable in
<lb/>which she could be placed; she was tired, indeed, of
<lb/>dissipation, and shocked at the sight of unfeeling ex

	  <lb/>varice to drive her from the mansion of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>,
<lb/>and haughtiness with ostentation to exclude her from
	  <lb/>that of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>She came back, therefore, to <placeName>Portman-Square</placeName>, dis
<lb/>appointed in her hopes, and sick both of those whom
<lb/>she quitted, and of those to whom she was returning;
<lb/>but in going to her own apartment, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/>eagerly stopping her, begged she would come into the
<lb/>drawing-room, where she promised her a most agree
<lb/>able surprise.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, for an instant, imagined that some old ac

<lb/>upon her entrance, she saw only <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and some
<lb/>workmen, and found that the agreeable surprise was
<lb/>to proceed from the sight of an elegant Awning, pre
<lb/>pared for one of the inner apartments, to be fixed
<lb/>over a long desert-table, which was to be ornamented
<lb/>with various devices of cut glass.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q487" next="q488">Did you ever see any thing so beautiful in your
<lb/>life?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q488" prev="q487">and when the table is
<lb/>covered with the coloured ices, and those sort of
<lb/>things, it will be as beautiful again.  We shall have
	    <lb/>it ready for <name>Tuesday</name> se'nnight.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I understood you were engaged to go to the Mas
<lb/>querade?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>So we shall; only we intend to see masks at home
<lb/>first.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q489" next="q490">I have some thoughts,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, leading
<lb/>the way to another small room, <q id="q490" prev="q489">of running up a
<lb/>flight of steps, and a little light gallery here, and so
<lb/>making a little Orchestra.  What would such a thing
	    <lb/>come to, <persName>Mr. Tomkins</persName>?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q491" next="q492">O, a trifle, sir,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Tomkins</persName>, <q id="q492" prev="q491">a mere
<lb/>nothing.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/><q>Well, then, give orders for it, and let it be done
<lb/>directly.  I don't care how slight it is, but pray let it
	    <lb/>be very elegant.  Won't it be a great addition, <persName>Miss
<lb/>Beverley</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Indeed, sir, I don't think it seems to be very ne
<lb/>cessary,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; who wished much to take that
<lb/>moment for reminding him of the debt he had con
<lb/>tracted with <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q493" next="q494">Lord, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> is so grave!</q> cried <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Harrel</persName>, <q id="q494" prev="q493">nothing of this sort gives her any pleasure.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q495" next="q496">She has, indeed,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, trying to
<lb/>smile, <q id="q496" prev="q495">not much taste for the pleasure of being al
<lb/>ways surrounded by workmen.</q></p>
<p><lb/>And, as soon as she was able, she retired to her
<lb/>room, feeling, both on the part of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> and the
	  <lb/><name>Hills</name>, a resentment at the injustice of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/>which fixed her in the resolution of breaking through
<lb/>that facility of compliance, which had hitherto con
<lb/>fined her disapprobation to her own breast, and ven
<lb/>turing, henceforward, to mark the opinion she enter
<lb/>tained of his conduct, by consulting nothing but reason
<lb/>and principle in her own.</p>
<p><lb/>Her first effort towards this change was made im
<lb/>mediately, in begging to be excused from accompa
<lb/>nying <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to a large card assembly that
<lb/>evening.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, extremely surprised, asked a thousand
<lb/>times the reason of her refusal, imagining it to proceed
<lb/>from some very extraordinary cause; nor was she,
<lb/>without the utmost difficulty, persuaded at last that
<lb/>she merely meant to pass one evening by herself.</p>
<p><lb/>But the next day, when the refusal was repeated,
<lb/>she was still more incredulous; it seemed to her im
<pb n="136"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="R2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">132</mw>
<lb/>possible that any one who had the power to be in
<lb/>circled with company, could by choice spend a second
<lb/>afternoon alone; and she was so urgent in her re
<lb/>quest to be entrusted with the secret, that <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>found no way left to appease her, but by frankly con
<lb/>fessing she was weary of eternal visiting, and sick of
<lb/>living always in a crowd.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q497" next="q498">Suppose, then,</q> cried she, <q id="q498" prev="q497">I send for <persName>Miss La
<lb/>rolles</persName> to come and sit with you?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, not without laughing, declined this proposal,
<lb/>assuring her that no such assistant was necessary for
<lb/>her entertainment: yet it was not till after a long
<lb/>contention that she was able to convince her there
<lb/>would be no cruelty in leaving her by herself.</p>
<p><lb/>The following day, however, her trouble dimi
<lb/>nished; for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, ceasing to be suprised,
<lb/>thought little more of the matter, and forbore any
<lb/>earnestness of solicitation; and from that time, she
<lb/>suffered her to follow her own humour with very little
<lb/>opposition.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> was much concerned to find her
<lb/>so unmoved; and not less disappointed at the indif
<lb/>ference of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who, being seldom of the same
<lb/>parties with his lady, and seeing her too rarely either
<lb/>to communicate or hear any domestic occurences, far
<lb/>from being struck, as she had hoped, with the new
<lb/>way in which she passed her time, was scarce sen
<lb/>sible of the change, and interfered not upon the sub
<lb/>jeet.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, who continued to see her when
	  <lb/>he dined in <placeName>Portman-Square</placeName>, often enquired what she
<lb/>did with herself in an evening; but never obtaining
<lb/>any satisfactory answer, he concluded her engage
<lb/>ments were with people to whom he was a stranger.</p>
<pb n="137"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="R3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">133</mw>
<p>
<lb/>Poor <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> felt the cruellest disappointment
<lb/>in being deprived of the happiness of attending her in
<lb/>her evening's expeditions, when, whether he con
<lb/>versed with her or not, he was sure of the indulgence
<lb/>of seeing and hearing her.</p>
<p><lb/>But the greatest sufferer from this new regulation
<lb/>was <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who, unable any longer to endure
<lb/>the mortifications of which his morning visits to
	  <lb/><placeName>Portman-Square</placeName> had been productive, determined not
<lb/>to trust his temper with such provocations in future,
<lb/>but rather to take his chance of meeting with her
<lb/>elsewhere: for which purpose, he assiduously fre
<lb/>quented all public places, and sought acquaintance
<lb/>with every family and every person he believed to be
	  <lb/>known to the <name>Harrels</name>: but his patience was unre
<lb/>warded, and his diligence unsuccessful; he met with
<lb/>her no where, and, while he continued his search, fan
<lb/>cied every evil power was at work to lead him whi
<lb/>ther he was sure never to find her.</p>
<p><lb/>Meanwhile <persName>Cecilia</persName> passed her time greatly to her
<lb/>own satisfaction.  Her first care was to assist and
	  <lb/>comfort the <name>Hills</name>.  She went herself to their lodgings,
<lb/>ordered and paid for whatever the physician prescribed
<lb/>to the sick man, gave clothes to the children, and
<lb/>money and various necessaries to the wife.  She found
<lb/>that the poor carpenter was not likely to languish
<lb/>much longer, and therefore, for the present, only
<lb/>thought of alleviating his sufferings, by procuring him
<lb/>such indulgences as were authorised by his physician,
<lb/>and enabling his family to abate so much of their la
<lb/>bour as was requisite for obtaining time to nurse and
<lb/>attend him: but she meant, as soon as the last duties
<lb/>should be paid him, to assist his survivors in at
<pb n="138"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="R3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">134</mw>
<lb/>tempting to follow some better and more profitable
<lb/>business.</p>
<p><lb/>Her next solicitude was to furnish herself with a
<lb/>well-chosen collection of books; and this employment,
<lb/>which to a lover of literature, young and ardent in its
<lb/>pursuit, is perhaps the mind's first luxury, proved a
<lb/>source of entertainment so fertile and delightful that
<lb/>it left her nothing to wish.</p>
<p><lb/>She confined not her acquisitions to the limits of
<lb/>her present power, but, as she was laying in a stock
<lb/>for future as well as immediate advantage, she was
<lb/>restrained by no expence from gratifying her taste and
<lb/>her inclination.  She had now entered the last year
<lb/>of her minority, and therefore had not any doubt that
<lb/>her guardians would permit her to take up whatever
<lb/>sum she should require for such a purpose.</p>
<p><lb/>And thus, in the exercise of charity, the search of
<lb/>knowledge, and the enjoyment of quiet, serenely in
<lb/>innocent philosophy passed the hours of <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>

<lb/>improvements which were planned for almost every
<lb/>apartment that was to be opened for the reception of
<lb/>masks.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> herself, however little pleased with
<lb/>the attendant circumstance of wantonly accumulating
<lb/>unnecessary debts, was not the least animated of the
<lb/>party; she was a stranger to every diversion of this
<lb/>sort, and from the novelty of the scene, hoped for un
<lb/>common satisfaction.</p>
<p><lb/>At noon <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> sent for her to consult upon a
<lb/>new scheme which occurred to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, of fixing in
<lb/>fantastic forms some coloured lamps in the drawing
<lb/>room.</p>
<p><lb/>While they were all discoursing this matter over,
<lb/>one of the servants, who had two or three times whis
<lb/>pered some message to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and then retired,
<lb/>said, in a voice not too low to be heard by <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/><q>Indeed, Sir, I can't get him away.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q499" next="q500">He's an insolent scoundrel,</q> answered Mr. Har
<lb/>rel; <q id="q500" prev="q499">however, if I must speak to him, I must;</q> and
<lb/>went out of the room.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> still continued to exercise her fancy
<lb/>upon this new project, calling upon both <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb/>and <persName>Cecilia</persName> to admire her taste and contrivance; till
<lb/>they were all interrupted by the loudness of a voice
<lb/>from below stairs, which frequently repeated, <q>Sir, I
<lb/>can wait no longer!  I have been put off till I can be
<lb/>put off no more!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Startled by this, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> ceased her employ
<lb/>ment, and they all stood still and silent.  They then
<lb/>heard <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> with much softness answer, <q>Good
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Rawlins</persName> have a little patience; I shall receive a
<lb/>large sum of money to-morrow, or next day, and you
<lb/>may then depend upon being paid.</q></p>

<lb/><q id="q501" next="q502">Sir,</q> cried the man, <q id="q502" prev="q501">you have so often told me
<lb/>the same, that it goes just for nothing; I have had a

<lb/>that can't be waited for any longer.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q503" next="q504">Certainly, <persName>Mr. Rawlins</persName>,</q> replied <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/>with still increasing gentleness, <q id="q504" prev="q503">and certainly you
<lb/>shall have it; nobody means to dispute your right; I
<lb/>only beg you to wait a day, or two days at furthest,

<lb/>employ any body else, and I shall have occasion for

<lb/>at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName> that will be very considerable.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q505" next="q506">Sir,</q> said the man, still louder, <q id="q506" prev="q505">it is of no use
<lb/>your employing me, if I can never get my money: All
<lb/>my workmen must be paid whether I am or no; and
<lb/>so, if I must needs speak to a lawyer, why there's no
<lb/>help for it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q507" next="q508">Did you ever hear any thing so impertinent?</q> ex

<lb/>very much to blame, if ever he lets that man do any
<lb/>thing more for him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Just then <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> appeared, and, with an air of
<lb/>affected unconcern, said, <q>Here's the most insolent
<lb/>rascal of a mason below stairs I ever met with in my
<lb/>life; he has come upon me, quite unexpectedly, with
<lb/>a bill of 400<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. and won't leave the house without the

<lb/>favour to speak to the fellow, for I could not bear to
<lb/>stay with him any longer.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Do you wish me to give him a draught for the
<lb/>money upon my own banker?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q509" next="q510">That would be vastly obliging,</q> answered <persName>Mr.

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">137</mw>
<lb/>Harrel</persName>, <q id="q510" prev="q509">and I will give you my note for it directly.
<lb/>And so we shall get rid of this fellow at once: and he
<lb/>shall do nothing more for me as long as he lives.  I
<lb/>will run up a new building at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName> next
<lb/>summer, if only to shew him what a job he has lost.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q511" next="q512">Pay the man at once, there's a good brother,</q>
<lb/>cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q id="q512" prev="q511">and let's hear no more of him.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The two gentlemen then retired to another room,
<lb/>and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, after praising the extreme good-na
<lb/>ture of her brother, of whom she was very fond, and
<lb/>declaring that the mason's impertinence had quite
<lb/>frightened her, again returned to her plan of new de
<lb/>corations.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, amazed at this indifference to the state of
<lb/>her husband's affairs, began to think it was her own
<lb/>duty to talk with her upon the subject: and therefore,
<lb/>after a silence so marked that <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> enquired
<lb/>into its reason, she said, <q>Will you pardon me, my
<lb/>dear friend, if I own I am rather surprised to see you
<lb/>continue these preparations?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Lord, why?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Because any fresh unnecessary expences just now,
<lb/>till <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> actually receives the money he talks
<lb/>of</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why, my dear, the expence of such a thing as this
<lb/>is nothing; in <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s affairs I assure you it
<lb/>will not be at all felt.  Besides, he expects money so
<lb/>soon, that it is just the same as if he had it already.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, unwilling to be too officious, began then to
<lb/>express her admiration of the goodness and generosity
<lb/>of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, taking frequent occasion, in the course
<lb/>of her praise, to insinuate that those only can be pro
<lb/>perly liberal, who are just and conomical.</p>

<p>
<lb/>She had prepared no masquerade habit for this
<lb/>evening, as <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, by whose direction she was
<lb/>guided, informed her it was not necessary for ladies
<lb/>to be masked at home, and said she should receive her
<lb/>company herself in a dress which she might wear upon
	  <lb/>any other occasion.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, also, and <persName>Mr. Ar
<lb/>nott</persName>, made not any alteration in their appearance.</p>
<p><lb/>At about eight o'clock the business of the evening
<lb/>began; and before nine, there were so many masks
<lb/>that <persName>Cecilia</persName> wished she had herself made one of the
<lb/>number, as she was far more conspicuous in being al
<lb/>most the only female in a common dress, than any
<lb/>masquerade habit could have made her.  The novelty
<lb/>of the scene, however, joined to the general air of
<lb/>gaiety diffused throughout the company, shortly les
<lb/>sened her embarrassment; and after being somewhat
<lb/>familiarized to the abruptness with which the masks
<lb/>approached her, and the freedom with which they
<lb/>looked at or addressed her, the first confusion of her
<lb/>situation subsided, and in her curiosity to watch
<lb/>others, she ceased to observe how much she was
<lb/>watched herself.</p>
<p><lb/>Her expectations of entertainment were not only
<lb/>fulfilled but surpassed; the variety of dresses, the
<lb/>medley of characters, the quick succession of figures,
<lb/>and the ludicrous mixture of groupes, kept her atten
<lb/>tion unwearied; while the conceited efforts at wit, the
<lb/>total thoughtlessness of consistency, and the ridiculous
<lb/>incongruity of the language with the appearance, were
<lb/>incitements to surprise and diversion without end.
<lb/>Even the local cant of, <emph>Do you know me?  Who are
<lb/>you?</emph> and <emph>I know you;</emph> with the sly pointing of the
<lb/>finger, the arch nod of the head, and the pert squeak
<pb n="143"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="S2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">139</mw>
<lb/>of the voice, though wearisome to those who frequent
<lb/>such assemblies, were, to her unhackneyed observa
<lb/>tion, additional subjects of amusement.</p>
<p><lb/>Soon after nine o'clock, every room was occupied,
<lb/>and the common crowd of regular masqueraders were
<lb/>dispersed through the various apartments.  Dominos
<lb/>of no character, and fancy-dresses of no meaning,
<lb/>made, as is usual at such meetings, the general herd
	  <lb/>of the company; for the rest, the men were <name>Spaniards</name>,
	  <lb/>chimney-sweepers, <name>Turks</name>, watchmen, conjurers, and
<lb/>old women; and the ladies, shepherdesses, orange
	  <lb/>girls, <name>Circassians</name>, gipseys, haymakers, and sultanas.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> had, as yet, escaped any address beyond the
<lb/>customary enquiry of <emph>Do you know me?</emph> and a few
<lb/>passing compliments; but when the rooms filled, and
<lb/>the general crowd gave general courage, she was at
<lb/>tacked in a manner more pointed and singular.</p>
<p><lb/>The very first mask who approached her, seemed
<lb/>to have nothing less in view than preventing the ap
<lb/>proach of every other: yet had he little reason to hope
<lb/>favour for himself, as the person he represented, of
<lb/>all others least alluring to the view, was the devil!
<lb/>He was black from head to foot, save that two red
<lb/>horns seemed to issue from his forehead; his face was
<lb/>so completely covered, that the sight only of his eyes
<lb/>was visible, his feet were cloven, and in his right hand
<lb/>he held a wand the colour of fire.</p>
<p><lb/>Waving this wand as he advanced towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>he cleared a semi-circular space before her chair,
<lb/>thrice with the most profound reverence bowed to
<lb/>her, thrice turned himself around with sundry gri
<lb/>maces, and then fiercely planted himself at her side.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was amused by his mummery, but felt no
<pb n="144"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="S2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">140</mw>
<lb/>great delight in his guardianship, and, after a short
<lb/>time, arose, with intention to walk to another place;
<lb/>but the black gentleman, adroitly moving round her,
<lb/>held out his hand to obstruct her passage, and there
<lb/>fore, preferring captivity to resistance, she was
<lb/>again obliged to seat herself.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>An <name>Hotspur</name>, who just then made his appearance,
<lb/>was now strutting boldly towards her; but the devil,
<lb/>rushing furiously forwards, placed himself immediately
	  <lb/>between them.  <persName>Hotspur</persName>, putting his arms a-kembo
<lb/>with an air of defiance, give a loud stamp with his
<lb/>right foot, and thenmarched into another room.</p>
<p><lb/>The victorious devil ostentatiously waved his wand,
<lb/>and returned to his station.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who had never moved two yards from
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, knowing her too well to suppose she received
<lb/>any pleasure from being thus distinguished, modestly
<lb/>advanced to offer his assistance in releasing her from
<lb/>confinement; but the devil, again describing a circle
<lb/>with his wand, gave him three such smart raps on
<lb/>the head, that his hair was disordered, and his face
<lb/>covered with powder.  A general laugh succeeded;
<lb/>and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, too diffident to brave railery, or
<lb/>withstand shame, retired in confusion.</p>
<p><lb/>The black gentleman seemed now to have all au
<lb/>thority in his own hands, and his wand was brandished
<lb/>with more ferocity than ever, no one again venturing
<lb/>to invade the domain he thought fit to appropriate for
<lb/>his own.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>At length, however, a <persName>Don Quixote</persName> appeared, and
<lb/>every mask in the room was eager to point out to him
<lb/>the imprisonment of <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>This <persName>Don Quixote</persName> was accoutred with tolerable

<lb/>exactness, according to the description of the admi
	  <lb/>rable <persName>Cervantes;</persName> his armour was rusty, his helmet
<lb/>was a barber's bason, his shield a pewter dish, and
<lb/>his lance an old sword fastened to a slim cane.  His
<lb/>figure, tall and thin, was well adapted to the character
<lb/>he represented; and his mask, which depictured a
<lb/>lean and haggard face, worn with care, yet fiery with
<lb/>crazy passions, exhibited, with propriety the most
<lb/>striking, the knight of the doleful countenance.</p>
<p><lb/>The complaints against the devil, with which imme
<lb/>diately and from all quarters he was assailed, he heard
<lb/>with the most solemn taciturnity: after which, making
<lb/>a motion for general silence, he stalked majestically
<lb/>towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>, but stopping short of the limits pre
<lb/>scribed by her guard, he kissed his spear in token of
<lb/>allegiance, and then, slowly dropping upon one knee,
<lb/>began the following address;

<p><lb/>Here he ceased; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who laughed at this
<lb/>characteristic address, though she had not courage to
<lb/>answer it, again made an effort to quit her place, but
<lb/>again by the wand of her black persecutor was pre
<lb/>vented.</p>
<p><lb/>This little incident was answer sufficient for the
<lb/>valorous knight, who indignantly exclaimed,

<lb/>my vengeance upon this unobliging caitiff, for his most

<p><lb/>Then, bowing low, he turned from her, and thus

<p><lb/>He then attempted to strike his shoulder with his
<lb/>spear, but the black gentleman, adroitly eluding the
<lb/>blow, defended himself with his wand; a mock fight
<lb/>ensued, conducted on both sides with admirable dex
<lb/>terity; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, less eager to view it than to be
<lb/>come again a free agent, made her escape into another
<lb/>apartment; while the rest of the ladies, though they
<lb/>almost all screamed, jumped upon chairs and sofas to
<lb/>peep at the combat.</p>
<p><lb/>In conclusion, the wand of the knight of the hor

<p><lb/><q id="q521" next="q522">I was monstrous sorry,</q> returned the goddess,

<lb/>I really believe there's a common chimney-sweeper got

<lb/>for every time he moves, the soot smells so you can't
<lb/>think; quite real soot, I assure you! only conceive

<lb/>suffocate him!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here she was interrupted by the re-appearance of
<lb/><mcr>Don Devil;</mcr>  who, looking around him, and perceiv
<lb/>ing that his antagonist was gone, again advanced to
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>; not, however, with the authority of his first
<lb/>approach, for with his wand he had lost much of his
<lb/>power; but to recompence himself for this disgrace, he
<lb/>had recourse to another method equally effectual for
<lb/>keeping his prey to himself, for he began a growling,
<lb/>so dismal and disagreeable, that while many of the
<lb/>ladies, and, among the first, the <mcr>Goddess of Wisdom
<lb/>and Courage,</mcr> ran away to avoid him, the men all stood
<lb/>aloof, to watch what next was to follow.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> now became seriously uneasy; for she was
<lb/>made an object of general attention, yet could neither
<lb/>speak nor be spoken to.  She could suggest no motive

<lb/>only person who could have the assurance to practise
<lb/>it was <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>After some time spent thus disagreeably, a white
<lb/>domino, who for a few minutes had been a very at
<lb/>tentive spectator, suddenly came forward, and ex
<lb/>claiming, <q id="q523" next="q524" rend="pre()post()slant(italic)">I'll cross him though he blast me!</q>
<lb/>rushed upon the fiend, and grasping one of his horns,
<lb/>called out to a Harlequin who stood near him, <q id="q524" prev="q523">Har
<lb/>lequin! do you fear to fight the devil?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Not I, truly,</q> answered <name>Harlequin</name>, whose voice
<lb/>immediately betrayed young <persName>Morrice</persName>, and who, is
<lb/>suing from the crowd, whirled himself round before
<lb/>the black gentleman with yet more agility than he
<lb/>had himself done before <persName>Cecilia</persName>, giving him, from
<lb/>time to time, many smart blows on his shoulders,
<lb/>head and back, with his wooden sword.</p>
<p><lb/>The rage of <mcr>Don Devil</mcr> at this attack seemed some
<lb/>what beyond what a masquerade character rendered
<lb/>necessary; he foamed at the mouth with resentment,
<lb/>and defended himself with so much vehemence, that
	  <lb/>he soon drove poor <name>Harlequin</name> into another room;
<lb/>but, when he would have returned to his prey, the
<lb/>genius of pantomime, curbed, but not subdued, at the
<lb/>instigation of the white domino, returned to the
<lb/>charge, and by a perpetual rotation of attack and re
<lb/>treat, kept him in constant employment, pursuing
<lb/>him from room to room, and teazing him without ces
<lb/>sation or mercy.</p>
<p><lb/>Mean time <persName>Cecilia</persName>, delighted at being released, hur
<lb/>ried into a corner, where she hoped to breathe and

<lb/>him at bay, followed her with congratulations upon
<lb/>her recovered freedom.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q525" next="q526">It is you,</q> answered she, <q id="q526" prev="q525">I ought to thank for
<lb/>it, which indeed I do most heartily.  I was so tired
<lb/>of confinement, that my mind seemed almost as little
<lb/>at liberty as my person.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q527" next="q528">Your persecutor, I presume,</q> said the domino,

<p><lb/><q id="q529" next="q530">I hope so,</q> answered she, <q id="q530" prev="q529">because there is one

<p><lb/><q id="q531" next="q532">O, depend upon it,</q> cried he, <q id="q532" prev="q531">there are many
<lb/>who would be happy to confine you in the same man
<lb/>ner; neither have you much cause for complaint;
<lb/>you have, doubtless, been the aggressor, and played
<lb/>this game yourself without mercy, for I read in your
<lb/>face the captivity of thousands; have you, then, any
<lb/>right to be offended at the spirit of retaliation which
<lb/>one, out of such numbers, has courage to exert in
<lb/>return?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q533" next="q534">I protest,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q534" prev="q533">I took you for my

<p><lb/><q>From seeing the danger to which my incautious

<lb/>take you for a very mischievious sort of person; and
<lb/>I fear the poor devil from whom I rescued you, will
<lb/>be amply revenged for his disgrace, by finding that
<lb/>the first use you make of your freedom, is to doom
<lb/>your deliverer to bondage.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here they were disturbed by the extreme loquacity
<lb/>of two opposite parties; and listening attentively,
<lb/>they heard from one side, <q>My angel! fairest of
<pb n="151"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="T2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">147</mw>
<lb/>creatures! goddess of my heart!</q> uttered in accents
<lb/>of rapture; while from the other, the vociferation
<lb/>was so violent, they could distinctly hear nothing.</p>
<p><lb/>The white domino satisfied his curiosity by going to
<lb/>both parties; and then, returning to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, said,
<lb/><q>Can you conjecture who was making those soft
	    <lb/>speeches? a <name>Shylock</name>! his knife all the time in his
<lb/>hand, and his design, doubtless, to <emph>cut as near the
<lb/>heart as possible!</emph> while the loud cackling from the
<lb/>other side, is owing to the riotous merriment of a
<lb/>noisy Mentor!  When next I hear a disturbance, I
	    <lb/>shall expect to see some simpering <persName>Pythagoras</persName> stunned
<lb/>by his talkative disciples.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q535" next="q536">To own the truth,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q536" prev="q535">the almost
<lb/>universal neglect of the characters assumed by these
<lb/>masquers, has been the chief source of my entertain
<lb/>ment this evening; for at a place of this sort, the
<lb/>next best thing to a character well supported, is a
<lb/>character ridiculously burlesqued.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q537" next="q538">You cannot, then, have wanted amusement,</q>
<lb/>returned the domino; <q id="q538" prev="q537">for among all the persons
<lb/>assembled in these apartments, I have seen only three
<lb/>who have seemed conscious that any change but that
<lb/>of dress was necessary to disguise them.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And pray who are those?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>A <persName>Don Quixote</persName>, a school-master, and your friend
<lb/>the devil.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q539" next="q540">O call him not my friend!</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb/><q id="q540" prev="q539">for indeed in or out of that garb he is particularly
<lb/>my aversion.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q541" next="q542"><mcr>My</mcr> friend, then, I will call him,</q> said the
<lb/>domino; <q id="q542" prev="q541">for so, were he ten devils, I must think
<lb/>him, since I owe him the honour of conversing with
<pb n="152"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">148</mw>
<lb/>you.  And, after all, to give him his due, to which,
<lb/>you know, he is even proverbially entitled, he has
<lb/>shewn such abilities in the performance of his part, so
<lb/>much skill in the display of malice, and so much per
<lb/>severance in the art of tormenting, that I cannot but
<lb/>respect his ingenuity and capacity.  And, indeed, if
<lb/>instead of an evil genius, he had represented a guar
<lb/>dian angel, he could not have shewn a more refined
<lb/>taste in his choice of an object to hover about.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Just then they were approached by a young hay
<lb/>maker, to whom the white domino called out, <q>You
<lb/>look as gay and as brisk as if fresh from the hay-field,
<lb/>after only half a day's work.  Pray how is it you
<lb/>pretty lasses find employment for the winter?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q543" next="q544">How?</q> cried she, pertly; <q id="q544" prev="q543">why the same as for
<lb/>the summer!</q>  And pleased with her own readiness
<lb/>at repartee, without feeling the ignorance it betrayed,
<lb/>she tript lightly on.</p>
<p><lb/>Immediately after, the school-master, mentioned
<lb/>by the white domino, advanced to <persName>Cecilia</persName>.  His dress
<lb/>was merely a long wrapping gown of green stuff, a
<lb/><sic corr=''>a </sic>pair of red slippers, and a woolen night cap of the
<lb/>same colour; while, as the symbol of his profession,
<lb/>he held a rod in his hand.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q545" next="q546">Ah, fair lady,</q> he cried, <q id="q546" prev="q545">how soothing were it

<lb/>for such corruption of taste!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q549" next="q550">This repulse,</q> answered he, <q id="q550" prev="q549">is just what I
<lb/>feared; for alas! under what pretence could a poor
<lb/>miserable pedagogue presume to approach you?
<lb/>Should I examine you in the dead languages, would
<lb/>not your living accents charm from me all power of
<lb/>reproof?  Could I look at you, and hear a false con

<lb/>would not my subsequent remorse make me want it
<lb/>myself as a madman? Were your fair hand spread
<lb/>out to me for correction, should I help applying my

<lb/>be <emph>called up</emph>, should I ever remember to have you

<lb/>myself?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had no difficulty in knowing this pre

<lb/>beginning to propose conditions, for according him
<lb/>her favour, when their ears were assailed by a forced
<lb/>phthisical cough, which they found proceeded from
<lb/>an apparent old woman, who was a young man in
<lb/>disguise, and whose hobbling gait, grunting voice,
<lb/>and most greivous asthmatic complaints, seemed
<lb/>greatly enjoyed and applauded by the company.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q551" next="q552">How true is it, yet how inconsistent,</q> cried the

<lb/>in long life, respect and

<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, delighted both by the understanding and
<lb/>humanity of her new acquaintance, and pleased at
<lb/>being joined by <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, was beginning to be
<lb/>perfectly satisfied with her situation, when, creeping
<lb/>softly towards her, she again perceived the black
<lb/>gentleman.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q553" next="q554">Ah!</q> cried she, with some vexation, <q id="q554" prev="q553">here

<p><lb/><q id="q555" next="q556">Fear not,</q> cried the white domino; <q id="q556" prev="q555">he is an

<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then perceiving <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, begged he
<lb/>would also assist in barricading her from the fiend

<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> most gratefully acceeded to the pro

<lb/>ing officer, assigned to each his station; he desired
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> would keep quietly to her seat, appointed the
<lb/>school-master to be on her guard on the left, took pos

<p><lb/>This arrangement being settled, the guards of the

<lb/>but while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was considering whether it were
<lb/>better to face the beseiged, or the enemy, the arch

<lb/>rious expostulation upon the ill-breeding of this be
<lb/>haviour; but the devil, resting all excuse upon sup
<lb/>porting his character, only answered by growling.</p>
<p><lb/>The white domino seemed to hesitate for a moment
<lb/>in what manner to conduct himself, and with a quick
<lb/>ness that marked his chagrin, said to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>You
<lb/>told me you knew himhas he any right to follow

<p><lb/><q id="q557" next="q558">If he thinks he has,</q> answered she, a little

<p><lb/>And then, to avoid any hazard of altercation, she

<lb/>a man of so much insolence as the Baronet.</p>
<p><lb/>The school-master, laughing at the whole transac

<p><lb/><q id="q559" next="q560">We shall, at least, fortify you,</q> said the white

<p><lb/>Here the black gentleman half raised himself, and

<lb/>commoded by his dress; he held his soot-bag over
<lb/>one arm, and his shovel under the other.  As soon as
<lb/>he espied <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose situation was such as to
<lb/>prevent her eluding him, he hooted aloud, and
<lb/>came stumping up to her.  <q id="q577" next="q578">Ah, ha,</q> he cried, <q id="q578" prev="q577">found
<lb/>at last;</q> then, throwing down his shovel, he opened

<p><lb/><q id="q612" next="q613">Perhaps so,</q> said the domino; <q id="q613" prev="q612">but I fear I

<p><lb/><q id="q614" next="q615">What's here?</q> cried the chimney-sweeper,

<lb/>Don't like it; looks like the devil.  You shan't stay

<p><lb/>He then offered <persName>Cecilia</persName> his hand; but the black

<lb/>paid her in dumb shew, the humblest devoirs,
<lb/>yet prevented her from removing.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q616" next="q617">Ah! ha!</q> cried the chimney-sweeper, signifi

<lb/>chimney-sweeper exclaimed, <q>Come, come with

<p><lb/>He then again held out his hand, but <persName>Cecilia</persName>,

<p><lb/><q id="q618" next="q619">Shew you the way,</q> cried he; <q id="q619" prev="q618">shovel him off.</q>
<lb/>And taking his shovel, he very roughly set about re
<lb/>moving him.</p>
<p><lb/>The fiend then began a yell so horrible, that it
<lb/>disturbed the whole company; but the chimney
<lb/>sweeper, only saying <q>Aye, aye, blacky, growl away,
<lb/>blackymakes no odds,</q> sturdily continued his
<lb/>work; and, as the fiend had no chance of resisting so
<lb/>coarse an antagonist without a serious struggle, he
<lb/>was presently compelled to change his ground.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q620" next="q621">Warm work!</q> cried the victorious chimney

<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, once again freed from her persecutor, in
<lb/>stantly quitted her place, almost equally desirous to
<lb/>escape the haughty Turk, who was peculiarly her
<lb/>aversion, and the facetious chimney-sweeper, whose
<lb/>vicinity, either on account of his dress or his conver
<lb/>sation, was by no means desirable.  She was not,
<lb/>however, displeased that the white domino and the
<lb/>school-master still continued to attend her.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q622" next="q623">Pray look,</q> said the white domino, a they en

<lb/>is there any in the room half so expressive of
<lb/>despondency?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>The reason, however,</q> answered the school

<pb n="162"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="U3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">158</mw>
<lb/>anchor upon which she reclines, presents an occa
<lb/>sion irresistible for an attitude of elegant dejection;
<lb/>and the assumed character is always given up, where
<lb/>an opportunity offers to display any beauty, or
<lb/>manifest any perfection in the dear proper person!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q624" next="q625">But why,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q625" prev="q624">should she assume the
<lb/>character of <mcr>Hope?</mcr> Could she not have been
<lb/>equally dejected, and equally elegant as Niobe, or
<lb/>some tragedy queen?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q626" next="q627">But she does not assume that character,</q> an
<lb/>swered the school-master; <q id="q627" prev="q626">she does not even think
<lb/>of it; the dress is her object, and that alone fills up
<lb/>all her ideas.  Enquire of almost any body in the room
<lb/>concerning the persons they seem to represent,
<lb/>and you will find their ignorance more gross than you
<lb/>can imagine; they have not once thought upon the
<lb/>subject; accident, or convenience, or caprice has
<lb/>alone directed their choice.</q></p>
<p><lb/>A tall and elegant youth now approached them,
	  <lb/>whose laurels and harp announces <persName>Apollo</persName>.  The
<lb/>white domino immediately enquired of him if the
<lb/>noise and turbulence of the company had any chance
<lb/>of being stilled into silence and rapture, by the divine
<lb/>music of the inspired god?</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q628" next="q629">No,</q> answered he, pointing to the room in which
<lb/>was erected the new gallery, and whence, as he spoke,
<lb/>issued the sound of an <foreign lang="fre">hautboy;</foreign>  <q id="q629" prev="q628">there is a flute
<lb/>playing there already.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q630" next="q631">O for a <name>Midas</name>,</q> cried the white domino, <q id="q631" prev="q630">to
<lb/>return to this leather-eared god the disgrace he re
<lb/>ceived from him!</q></p>
<p><lb/>They now proceeded to the apartment which had
<lb/>been lately fitted up for refreshments, and which was
<pb n="163"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="U4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">159</mw>
<lb/>so full of company, that they entered it with difficulty.
	  <lb/>And here they were again joined by <persName>Minerva</persName>, who,
<lb/>taking <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s hand, said, <q>Lord, how glad I am
<lb/>you've got away from that frightful black mask!  I
<lb/>can't conceive who he is; nobody can find out; it's
<lb/>monstrous odd, but he has not spoke a word all night,
<lb/>and he makes such a shocking noise when people
<lb/>touch him, that I assure you it's enough to put one
<lb/>in a fright.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q632" next="q633">And pray,</q> cried the school-master, disguising
<lb/>his voice, <q id="q633" prev="q632">how camest thou to take the helmet of
	    <lb/><persName>Minerva</persName> for a fool's cap?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q635" next="q636">Lord, I have not,</q> cried she innocently; <q id="q636" prev="q635">why
	    <lb/>the whole dress is <persName>Minerva's</persName>; don't you see?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q638" next="q639">My dear child,</q> answered he, <q id="q639" prev="q638">thou couldest
	    <lb/>as well with that little figure pass for a <name>Goliah</name>, as
	    <lb/>with that little wit for a <name>Pallas</name>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Their attention was now drawn fron the goddess
	  <lb/>of wisdom to a mad <name>Edgar</name>, who so vehemently ran
	  <lb/>about the room calling out <q>Poor <persName>Tom's</persName> a cold!</q>
<lb/>that, in a short time, he was obliged to take off his
<lb/>mask, from an effect, not very delicate, of the heat!</p>
<p><lb/>Soon after, a gentleman desiring some lemonade,
<lb/>whose toga spoke the consular dignity, though his
	  <lb/>broken English betrayed a native of <placeName>France</placeName>, the
<lb/>school-master followed him, and, with reverence the
	  <lb/>most profound, began to address him in <name>Latin</name>; but,
<lb/>turning quick toward him, he gaily said, <q><foreign lang="fre">Mon

<p><lb/>Just then <persName>Cecilia</persName>, while looking about the room
<lb/>for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, felt herself suddenly pinched by
<lb/>the cheek, and hastily turning round, perceived again
<lb/>her friend the chimney-sweeper, who, laughing, cried
<lb/><q>Only me! don't be frightened.  Have something to
<lb/>tell you;had no luck!got never a husband yet!
<lb/>can't find one! looked all over, too; sharp as a needle,
<lb/>Not one to be had! all catched up!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q640" next="q641">I am glad to hear it, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, some
<lb/>what vexed by observing the white domino atten
<lb/>tively listening; <q id="q641" prev="q640">and I hope, therefore, you will
<lb/>give yourself no further trouble.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q642" next="q643">Pretty duck!</q> cried he, chiuking her under the
<lb/>chin; <q id="q643" prev="q642">never mind, don't be cast down; get one at

<lb/>take up with less.  Good by, ducky, good by! must
<lb/>go home now--begin to be nodding.</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then, repeating his kind caresses, he walked
<lb/>away.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="q644" next="q645">Do you think, then,</q> said the white domino,
<lb/><q id="q645" prev="q644">more highly of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> for discernment and
<lb/>taste then of any body?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q646" next="q647">I hope not!</q> answered she, <q id="q647" prev="q646">for low indeed
<lb/>should I then think of the rest of the world!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q648" next="q649">The commision with which he is charged,</q> re

<lb/>discernment and taste might be necessary ingredients
<lb/>for making such a choice as your approbation would
<lb/>sanctify; but perhaps his skill in guarding against
<lb/>any fraud or deduction in the stipulation he men
<lb/>tioned, may be all that is requisite for the execution
<lb/>of his trust.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q650" next="q651">I understand very well,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, a little

<lb/>it would fill me with shame and confusion; but as
<lb/>that is not the case, those, at least, are sensations
<lb/>which it cannot give me<sic corr=".">,</sic></q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q652" next="q653">My meaning,</q> cried the domino, with some
<lb/>earnestness, <q id="q653" prev="q652">should I express it seriously, would
<lb/>but prove to you the respect and admiration with
	    <lb/>which you have inspired me; and if indeed, as <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Briggs</persName> hinted, such a prize is to be purchased by
<lb/>riches, I know not, from what I have seen of its merit,
<lb/>any sum I should think adequate to its value.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q654" next="q655">You are determined, I see,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, smiling,
<lb/><q id="q655" prev="q654">to make most liberal amends for your asperity.</q></p>
<p><lb/>A loud clack of tongues now interrupted their dis
<lb/>course; and the domino, at the desire of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, for
<lb/>whom he had procured a seat, went forward to en
<lb/>quire what was the matter.  But scarce had he given
<lb/>up his place a moment, before, to her great mortifi
<lb/>cation, it was occupied by the fiend.</p>
<p><lb/>Again but with the same determined silence he
<lb/>had hitherto preserved, he made signs of obedience
<lb/>and homage, and her perplexity to conjecture who he
<lb/>could be, or what were his motives for this persecu
<lb/>tion, became the more urgent as they seemed the less
<lb/>likely to be satisfied.  But the fiend, who was no
<lb/>other than <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, had every instant less en
<lb/>couragement to make himself known; his plan had
<lb/>in nothing succeeded, and his provocation at its
<lb/>failure had caused him the bitterest disappointment;
<lb/>he had intended, in the character of a tormentor, not
<lb/>only to pursue and hover around her himself, but he
<lb/>had also hoped, in the same character, to have kept

<milestone unit="sig" n="X1v"/>

<lb/>at a distance all other admirers; but the violence
<lb/>with which he had over-acted his part, by raising her
<lb/>disgust and the indignation of the company, rendered
<lb/>his views wholly abortive; while the consciousness
<lb/>of an extravagance for which, if discovered, he could
<lb/>assign no reason not liable to excite suspicions of his
<lb/>secret motives, reduced him to guarding a painful
<lb/>and most irksome silence the whole evening.  And
	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whose unsuspicious mind the idea of <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Monckton</persName> had never occurred, added continually to
<lb/>the cruelty of his situation, by an undisguised aver
<lb/>sion to his assiduity, as well as by a manifest pre
<lb/>ference to the attendance of the white domino.  All,
<lb/>therefore, that his disappointed scheme now left in
<lb/>his power, was to watch her motions, listen to her
<lb/>discourse, and inflict occasionally upon others some
<lb/>part of the chagrin with which he was tormented
<lb/>himself.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>While they were in this situation, <persName>Harlequin</persName>, in
	  <lb/>consequence of being ridiculed by the <name>Turk</name> for want
<lb/>of agility, offered to jump over the new desert table,
<lb/>and desired to have a little space cleared to give room
<lb/>for his motions.  It was in vain the people who dis
<lb/>tributed the refreshments, and who were placed at the
<lb/>other side of the table, expostulated upon the danger
<lb/>of the experiment; <persName>Morrice</persName> had a rage of enterprize
<lb/>untameable, and therefore, first taking a run, he at
<lb/>tempted the leap.</p>
<p><lb/>The consequence was such as might naturally be
<lb/>expected; he could not accomplish his purpose, but,
<lb/>finding himself falling imprudently caught hold of
<lb/>the lately erected Awning, and pulled it entirely
<lb/>upon his own head, and with it the new contrived
<pb n="167"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="X2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">163</mw>
<lb/>lights, which in various forms were fixed to it, and
<lb/>which all came down together.</p>
<p><lb/>The mischief and confusion occasioned by this ex
<lb/>ploit were very alarming, and almost dangerous; those
<lb/>who were near the table suffered most by the crush,
<lb/>but splinters of the glass flew yet further; and as the
<lb/>room, which was small, had been only lighted up by
<lb/>lamps hanging from the Awning, it was now in total
<lb/>darkness, except close to the door, which was still
<lb/>illuminated from the adjoining apartments.</p>
<p><lb/>The clamour of Harlequin, who was covered with
<lb/>glass, paper machee, lamps, and oil, the screams of
<lb/>the ladies, the universal buz of tongues, and the
<lb/>struggle between the frighted crowd which was en
<lb/>closed to get out, and the curious crowd from the other
<lb/>apartments to get in, occasioned a disturbance and
<lb/>tumult equally noisy and confused.  But the most
<lb/>serious sufferer was the unfortunate fiend, who
<lb/>being nearer the table than <persName>Cecilia</persName>, was so pressed
<lb/>upon by the numbers which poured from it, that he
<lb/>found a separation unavoidable, and was unable, from
<lb/>the darkness and the throng, to discover whether she
<lb/>was still in the same place, or had made her escape
<lb/>into another.</p>
<p><lb/>She had, however, encountered the white domino,
<lb/>and, under his protection, was safely conveyed to a
<lb/>further part of the room.  Her intention and desire
<lb/>were to quit it immediately, but at the remonstrance
<lb/>of her conductor, she consented to remain some time
<lb/>longer.  <q id="q656" next="q657">The conflict at the door,</q> said he, <q id="q657" prev="q565">will
<lb/>quite overpower you.  Stay here but a few minutes,

<lb/>time, can you not, by this faint light, suppose me one
<lb/>of your guardians, <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, for example, or, if he
<lb/>is too old for me, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and entrust yourself to
<lb/>my care?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q658" next="q659">You seem wonderfully well acquainted with my
<lb/>guardians,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q659" prev="q658">I cannot imagine how you
<lb/>have had your intelligence.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q660" next="q661">Nor can I,</q> answered the domino, <q id="q661" prev="q660">imagine how
<lb/><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> became so particularly your favorite as to
<lb/>be entrusted with powers to dispose of you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You are mistaken indeed; he is entrusted with
<lb/>no powers but such as his own fancy has suggested.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>But how has <persName>Mr. Delville</persName> offended you, that with
<lb/>him only you seem to have no commerce or commu
<lb/>nication?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="q662" next="q663"><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>!</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>, still more sur
	  <lb/>prised, <q id="q663" prev="q662">are you also acquainted with <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="q664" next="q665">He is certainly a man of fashion,</q> continued the
<lb/>domino, <q id="q665" prev="q664">and he is also a man of honour; surely,
<lb/>then, he would be more pleasant for confidence and
<lb/>consultation, than one whose only notion of happiness
<lb/>is money, whose only idea of excellence is avarice,
<lb/>and whose only conception of sense is distrust!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here a violent outcry again interrupted their con
<lb/>versation; but not till <persName>Cecilia</persName> had satisfied her doubts
<lb/>concerning the white domino, by conjecturing he was
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, who might easily at the house of <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Monckton</persName> have gathered the little circumstances of
<lb/>her situation to which he alluded, and whose size and
<lb/>figure exactly resembled those of her new acquain
<lb/>tance.</p>
<p><lb/>The author of the former disturbance was now the
<lb/>occasion of the present; the fiend, having vainly
<pb n="169"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="X3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">165</mw>
<lb/>traversed the room in search of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, stumbled ac
	  <lb/>cidentally upon <persName>Harlequin</persName>, before he was freed from
<lb/>the relicks of his own mischief; and unable to resist
<lb/>the temptation of opportunity, and the impulse of re
<lb/>venge, he gave vent to the wrath so often excited by
<lb/>the blunders, forwardness, and tricks of <persName>Morrice</persName>, and
<lb/>inflicted upon him, with his own wooden sword, which
<lb/>he seized for that purpose, a chastisement the most
<lb/>serious and severe.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>Poor <persName>Harlequin</persName>, unable to imagine any reason for
<lb/>this violent attack, and already cut with the glass,
<lb/>and bruised with the fall, spared not his lungs in
<lb/>making known his disapprobation of such treatment:
<lb/>but the fiend, regardless either of his complaints or
<lb/>his resistance, forbore not to belabour him till com
<lb/>pelled by the entrance of people with lights.  And
<lb/>then, after artfully playing sundry anticks under pre
<lb/>tence of still supporting this character, with a motion
<lb/>too sudden for prevention, and too rapid for pursuit,
<lb/>he escaped out of the room, and hurrying down stairs,
<lb/>threw himself into an hackney chair, which conveyed
<lb/>him to a place where he privately changed his dress
<lb/>before he returned home; bitterly repenting the ex
<lb/>periment he had made, and conscious too late that
<lb/>had he appared in a character he might have avowed,
<lb/>he could, without impropriety, have attended <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>the whole evening.  But such is deservedly the fre
<lb/>quent fate of cunning, which, while it plots surprise
<lb/>and detection of others, commonly overshoots its
<lb/>its mark, and ends in its own disgrace.</p>
<p><lb/>The introduction of the lights now making manifest
<lb/>the confusion which
<lb/>the frolic of Harlequin had occa
<lb/>sioned, he was seized with such a dread
<lb/>of the resent
<pb n="170"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="X3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">166</mw>
<lb/>ment of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, that, forgetting blows, bruises
<lb/>and wounds, not one of which were so frightful to
<lb/>him as reproof, he made the last exhibition of his
<lb/>agility by an abrupt and hasty retreat.</p>
<p><lb/>He had, however, no reason for apprehension, since
<lb/>in everything that regarded expence, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had
<lb/>no feeling, and his lady had no thought.</p>
<p><lb/>The rooms now began to empty very fast, but
<lb/>among the few masks yet remaining, <persName>Cecilia</persName> again
	  <lb/>perceived <persName>Don Quixote</persName>; and while in conjunction
<lb/>with the white domino, she was allowing him the
<lb/>praise of having supported his character with more
<lb/>uniform propriety than any other person in the as
<lb/>sembly, she observed him taking off his mask for the
<lb/>convenience of drinking some lemonade, and, look
	  <lb/>ing in his face, found he was no other than <persName>Mr. Bel
<lb/>field</persName>!  Much astonished, and more than ever perplex
<lb/>ed, she again turned to the white domino, who seeing
<lb/>in her countenance a surprise of which he knew not
<lb/>the reason, said, half laughing, <q>You think, perhaps,
<lb/>I shall never be gone?</q>  <q>And indeed I am almost of
<lb/>the same opinion; but what can I do?  Instead of
<lb/>growing weary but he length of my stay, my reluc
<lb/>tance to shorten it encreases with its duration; and
<lb/>all the methods I take, whether by speaking to you
<lb/>or looking at you, with a view to be satiated, only
<lb/>double my eagerness for looking and listening again!
<lb/>I must go, however; and if I am happy, I may per
<lb/>haps meet with you again,though, if I am wise, I
<lb/>shall never seek you more!</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then, with the last stragglers that reluc
<lb/>tantly disappeared, he made his exit; leaving <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>greatly pleased with his conversation and his manners,
<pb n="171"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="X4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">167</mw>
<lb/>but extremely perplexed to account for his know
<lb/>ledge of her affairs and situation.</p>
<p><lb/>The school-master had already been gone some
<lb/>time.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>She was not earnestly pressed by the <name>Harrels</name> and
	  <lb/><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who still remained, to send to a ware
<lb/>house for a dress, and accompany them to the
<lb/>Pantheon; but though she was not without some in
<lb/>clination to comply, in the hope of further prolong
<lb/>ing the entertainment of an evening from which she
<lb/>had received much pleasure, she disliked the atten
<lb/>dance of the Baronet, and felt averse to grant any
<lb/>request that he could make, and therefore she beg
<lb/>ged that they would excuse her; and having waited to
<lb/>see their dresses, which were very superb, she retired
<lb/>to her own apartment.</p>
<p><lb/>A great variety of conjecture upon all that had
<lb/>passed, now, and till the moment that she sunk to
<lb/>rest, occupied her mind; the extraordinary perse
<lb/>cution of the fiend excited at once her curiosity and
<lb/>amazement; while the knowledge of her affairs shewn
<lb/>by the white domino, surprised her not less, and in
<lb/>terested her more.</p>

<milestone unit="sig" n="X4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">168</mw>
<lb/>She begged permission of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to have him
<lb/>asked up stairs, and was not a little surprized when
<lb/>he proved to be the same old gentleman whose
	  <lb/>singular exclamations had so much struck her at <persName>Mr.
	    <lb/>Monckton's</persName> and at the rehearsal of <title>Artaserse</title>.</p>
<p><lb/>Abruptly and with a stern aspect advancing to her,
<lb/><q>You are rich,</q> he cried; <q>are you therefore
<lb/>worthless?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hope not!</q> answered she, in some conster
<lb/>nation; while <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, believing his intention
<lb/>was to rob them, ran precipitately to the bell, which
<lb/>she rang without ceasing till two or three servants
<lb/>hastened into the room:  by which time, being less
<lb/>alarmed, she only made signs to them to stay, and
<lb/>stood quietly herself to wait what would follow.</p>
<p><lb/>The old man, without attending to her, continued
<lb/>his dialogue with <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Know you then,</q> he said <q>a blameless use of
<lb/>riches? such a use as not only in the braod glare of
<lb/>day shall shine resplendent, but in the darkness of
<lb/>midnight, and stillness of repose, shall give you re
<lb/>flections unimbittered, and slumbers unbroken?  tell
<lb/>me, know you this use?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Not so well, perhaps,</q> answered she, <q>as I
<lb/>ought; but I am very willing to learn better.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Begin, then, while yet youth and inexperience,
<lb/>new to the callousness of power and affluence, leave
<lb/>something good to work upon; yesterday you saw the
<lb/>extravagance of luxury and folly; to-day look
<lb/>deeper, and see, and learn to pity, the misery of dis
<lb/>ease and penury.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then put into her hand a paper, which con
<lb/>tained a most affecting account of the misery to
<pb n="173"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">169</mw>
<lb/>which a poor and wretched family had been reduced,
<lb/>by sickness, and various other misfortunes.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>open as day to melting charity,</q> having
<lb/>hastily perused it, took out her purse, and offering to
<lb/>him three guineas, said, <q>You must direct me, Sir,
<lb/>what to give, if this is insufficient.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Hast thou so much heart?</q> cried he, with emo
<lb/>tion, <q>and has fortune, though it has cursed thee with
<lb/>the temptation of prosperity, not yet rooted from thy
<lb/>mind its native benevolence?  I return in part thy li
<lb/>beral contribution; this,</q> taking one guinea, <q>dou
<lb/>bles my expectations; I will not, by making thy cha
<lb/>rity distress thee, accelerate the fatal hour of hardness
<lb/>and degeneracy.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He was then going; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, following him,
<lb/>said, <q>No, take it all!  Who should assist the poor
<lb/>if I will not?  Rich, without connections; powerful
<lb/>without wants; upon whom have they any claim if
<lb/>not upon me?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>True,</q> cried he, receiving the rest, <q>and wise as
<lb/>true.  Give, therefore, whilst yet thou hast the heart
<lb/>to give, and make, in thy days of innocence and kind
<lb/>ness, some interest with Heaven and the poor!</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then he disappeared.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Why, my dear,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>what could
<lb/>induce you give the man so much money?  Don't
<lb/>you see he is crazy?  I dare say he would have been
<lb/>just as well contented with sixpence.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I know not what he is,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>but his
<lb/>manners are not more singular than his sentiments are
<lb/>affecting; and if is actuated by charity to raise
<lb/>subscriptions for the indigent, he can surely apply to
<lb/>no one who ought so readily to contribute as myself.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> then came in, and his lady most ea
<lb/>gerly told him the transactions.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Scandalous!</q> he exclaimed; <q>why this is no
<lb/>better than being a house-breaker!  Pray give orders
<lb/>never to admit him again.  Three guineas!  I never
	    <lb/>heard so impudent a thing in my life!  Indeed, <persName>Miss
<lb/>Beverley</persName>, you must be more discreet in future, you
<lb/>will else be ruined before you know where you are.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Thus it is,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, half smiling, <q>that we
<lb/>can all ecture one another! to-day you recommend
<lb/>conomy to me:  yesterday I with difficulty forbore
<lb/>recommending it to you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Nay,</q> answered he, <q>that was quite another mat
<lb/>ter; expence incurred in the common way of a man's
<lb/>living is quite another thing to an extortion of this
<lb/>sort.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>It is another thing indeed,</q> said she, <q>but I know
<lb/>not that it is therefore a better.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> made no answer:  and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, privately
<lb/>moralizing upon the different estimates of expence
<lb/>and conomy made by the dissipated and the chari
<lb/>table, soon retired to her own apartment, determined
<lb/>firmly to adhere to her lately adopted plan, and ho
<lb/>ping, by the assistance of her new and very singular
<lb/>monitor, to extend her practice of doing good, by en
<lb/>larging her knowledge of distress.</p>
<p><lb/>Objects are, however, never wanting for the exer
<lb/>cise of benevolence; report soon published her libe
<lb/>rality, and those who wished to believe it, failed not
<lb/>to enquire into its truth.  She was soon at the head
<lb/>of a little band of pensioners, and, never satisfied
<lb/>with the generosity of her donations, found in a very
<lb/>short time, that the common allownace of her guar
<pb n="175"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">171</mw>
<lb/>dians were scarce adequate to the calls of her munifi
<lb/>cence.</p>
<p><lb/>And thus, in acts of goodness and charity, passed
<lb/>undisturbed another week of the life of <persName>Cecilia</persName>; but
<lb/>when the fervour of self-approbation lost its novelty,
<lb/>the pleasure with which her new plan was begun first
<lb/>subsided into tranquility, and then sank into languor.
<lb/>To a heart formed for friendship and affection the
<lb/>charms of solitude are very short-lived; and though
<lb/>she had sickened of the turbulence of perpetual com
<lb/>pany, she now wearied of passing all her time by her
<lb/>self, and sighed for the comfort of society, and the re
<lb/>lief of communication.  But she saw with astonish
<lb/>ment the difficulty with which this was to be obtained:
<lb/>the endless succession of diversions, the continual ro
<lb/>tation of assemblies, the numerousness of splendid en
<lb/>gagements, of which while every one complained,
<lb/>every one was proud to boast, so effectually impeded
<lb/>private meetings and friendly intercourse, that, which
<lb/>ever way she turned herself, all commerce seemed im
<lb/>practicable, but such as either led to dissipation, or
<lb/>accidentally flowed from it.</p>
<p><lb/>Yet finding the error into which her ardour of re
<lb/>formation had hurried her, and that a rigid seclusion
<lb/>from company was productive of a lassitude as little
<lb/>favourable to active virtue as dissipation itself, she re
<lb/>solved to soften her plan, and by mingling amusement
<lb/>with benevolence, to try, at least, to approach that
<lb/>golden mean, which, like the philosopher's stone, al
<lb/>ways eludes our grasp, yet always invites our wishes.</p>
<p><lb/>For this purpose she desired to attend <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>
<lb/>to the next Opera that should be represented.</p>
<p><lb/>The following Saturday, therefore, she accompanied
<pb n="176"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">172</mw>
	  <lb/>that lady and <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> to the <placeName>Haymarket</placeName>, escorted
<lb/>by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>They were very late; the Opera was begun, and
<lb/>even in the lobby the crowd was so great that their
<lb/>passage was obstructed.  Here they were presently
<lb/>accosted by <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, who, running up to <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>and taking her hand, said, <q>Lord, you can't conceive
<lb/>how glad I am to see you! why, my dear creature,
<lb/>where have you hid yourself these twenty ages?  You
<lb/>are quite in luck in coming to-night, I assure you;
<lb/>it's the best Opera we have had this season:  there's
<lb/>such a monstrous crowd there's no stirring.  We
<lb/>sha'n't get in this half hour.  The coffee-room is quite
<lb/>full:  only come and see; is it not delightful?</q></p>
<p><lb/>This intimation was sufficient for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/>whose love of the Opera was merely a love of com
<lb/>pany, fashion, and shew; and therefore to the coffee
<lb/>house she readily led the way.</p>
<p><lb/>And here <persName>Cecilia</persName> found rather the appearance of a
<lb/>brilliant assembly of ladies and gentlemen, collected
<lb/>merely to see and to entertain one another, than of
<lb/>distinct and casual parties, mixing solely from neces
<lb/>sity and waiting only for room to enter a theatre.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The first person that addressed them was <persName>Captain
<lb/>Aresby</persName>, who, with his usual delicate languishment,
<lb/>smiled upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and softly whispering, <q>How
<lb/>divinely you look to-night!</q> proceeded to pay his
<lb/>compliments to some other ladies.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Do pray now,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q>observe
	    <lb/><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>! only just see where he has fixed him
<lb/>self! in the very best place in the room, and keeping
<lb/>the fire from every body!  I do assure you that's al
<lb/>ways his way, and it's monstrous provoking, for if
<pb n="177"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">173</mw>
<lb/>one's ever so cold, he lollops so, that one's quite
<lb/>starved.  But you must know there's another thing
<lb/>he does that is quite as bad, for if he gets a seat, he
<lb/>never offers to move, if he sees one sinking with fa
<lb/>tigue.  And besides, if one is waiting for one's car
<lb/>riage two hours together, he makes it a rule never to
<lb/>stir a step to see for it.  Only think how monstrous!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>These are heavy complaints, indeed,</q> said Ceci
<lb/>lia, looking at him attentively; <q>I should have ex
<lb/>pected from his appearance a very different account of
<lb/>his gallantry, for he seems dressed with more studied
<lb/>elegance than anybody here.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O yes,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q>he is the sweetest
<lb/>dresser in the world:  he has the most delightful taste
<lb/>you can conceive, nobody has half so good a fancy.
<lb/>I assure yo it's a great thing to be spoke to by him:
<lb/>we are all of us quite angry when he won't take any
<lb/>notice of us.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Is your anger,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, laughing, <q>in ho
<lb/>nour of himself or of his coat?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why, Lord, don't you know all this time that he
<lb/>is an <foreign lang="fre">ennuye?</foreign></q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I know, at least,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that he
<lb/>would soon make one of me.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O but one is never affronted with an <foreign lang="fre">ennuye</foreign>, if he
<lb/>is ever so provoking, becuse one always knows what
<lb/>it means.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Is he agreeable?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why, to tell you the truth,but pray now don't
<lb/>mention it,I think
<lb/>him most excessive disagreeable!
<lb/>He yawns in one's face every time one
<lb/>looks at him.  I
<lb/>assure you sometimes I expect to see him fall fast
<lb/>asleep while I am talking to him, for he is so im
<pb n="178"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">174</mw>
<lb/>mensely absent he don't hear one half that one says;
<lb/>only conceive how horrid!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But why, then, do you encourage him? why do
<lb/>you take any notice of him?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, every body does, I assure you, else I would
<lb/>not for the world; but he is so courted you have no
<lb/>idea.  However, of all things let me advise you never
<lb/>to dance with him; I did once myself, and I declare
<lb/>I was quite distressed to death the whole time, for he
<lb/>was taken with such a fit of absence he knew nothing
<lb/>he was about, sometimes skipping and jumping with
<lb/>all the violence in the world, just as if he only danced
<lb/>for exercise, and sometimes standing quite still, or
<lb/>lolling against the wainscoat and gaping, and taking
<lb/>no more notice of me than if he had never seen me in
<lb/>his life!</q></p>
<p><lb/>The captain now, again advancing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, said,
<lb/><q>So you would not do us the honour to try the mas
<lb/>querade at the Pantheon? however, I hear you had a
<lb/>very brilliant spectacle at <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s.  I was quite
<lb/><foreign lang="fre">au desespoir</foreign> that I could not have the honour of
<lb/>sliding in; I did <foreign lang="fre">mon possible</foreign>, but it was quite be
<lb/>yond me.</q></p>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> now, growing very impatient to hear the
<lb/>Opera, begged to know if they might not make a trial
<lb/>to get into the pit!</p>
<p><lb/><q>I fear,</q> said the captain, smiling as they passed
<lb/>him, without offering any assistance, <q>you will find it
<lb/>extreme petrifying; for my part, I confess I am not
<lb/>upon the principle of crowding.</q></p>
<p>The ladies, however, accompanied by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb/>made the attempt, and soon found, according to the
<lb/>custom of report, that the difficulty, for the pleasure
<pb n="179"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">175</mw>
<lb/>of talking of it, had been considerably exaggerated.
<lb/>They were separated indeed, but their accomodation
<lb/>was tolerably good.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was much vexed to find the first act of the
<lb/>Opera almost over; but she was soon still more dissa
<lb/>tisfied when she discovered that she had no chance of
<lb/>hearing the little which remained:  the place she had
<lb/>happened to find vacant was next to a party of young
<lb/>ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own
<lb/>discourse, that they listened not to a note of the Opera,
<lb/>and so infinitely diverted with their own witticisms,
<lb/>that their tittering and loquacity allowed no one in
<lb/>their vicinity to hear better than themselves.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>tried in vain to confine her attention to the singers,
<lb/>she was distant from the stage, and to them she was
<lb/>near, and her fruitless attempts all ended in chagrin
<lb/>and impatience.</p>
<p><lb/>At length she resolved to make an effort for enter
<lb/>tainment in another way, and since the expectations
<lb/>which brought her to the Opera were destroyed, to
<lb/>try, by listening to her fair neighbours, whether those
<lb/>who occasioned her disappointment, could make her any amends.</p>
<p><lb/>For this purpose she turned to them wholly; yet
<lb/>was at first in no little perplexity to understand what
<lb/>was going forward, since so universal was the eager
<lb/>ness for talking, and so unsurmountable the antipathy
<lb/>to listening, that every one seemed to have her wishes
<lb/>bounded by a continual utterance of words, without
<lb/>waiting for any answer, or scarce even desiring to be
<lb/>heard.</p>
<p><lb/>But when, somewhat more used to their dialect and
<lb/>manner, she began better to comprehend their dis
<pb n="180"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">176</mw>
<lb/>course, wretchedly indeed did it supply to her the loss
<lb/>of the Opera.  She heard nothing but descriptions of
<lb/>trimmings, and complaints of hair-dressers, hints of
<lb/>conquest that teemed with vanity, and histories of
<lb/>engagements which were inflated with exultation.</p>
<p><lb/>At the end of the act, by the crowding forward of
<lb/>the gentlemen to see the dance, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> had an
<lb/>opportunity of making room for her by herself, and
<lb/>she had then some reason to expect hearing the rest of
<lb/>the Opera in peace, for the company before her, con
<lb/>sisting entirely of young men, seemed, even during
<lb/>the dance, fearful of speaking, lest their attention
<lb/>should be drawn for a moment from the stage.</p>
<p><lb/>But to her infinite surprize, no sooner was the
<lb/>second act begun, than their attention ended! they
<lb/>turned from the performers to each other, and entered
<lb/>into a whispering, but gay conversation, which though
<lb/>not loud enough to disturb the audience in general,
<lb/>kept in the ears of their neighbours, a buzzing which
<lb/>interrupted all pleasure from the representation.  Of
<lb/>this effect of their gaiety it seemed uncertain whether
<lb/>they were conscious, but very evident that they were careless.</p>
<p><lb/>The desperate resource which she had tried during
<lb/>the first act, of seeking entertainment from the very
<lb/>conversation which prevented her enjoying it, was not
<lb/>now even in her power: for these gentlemen, though
<lb/>as negligent as the young ladies had been whom they
<lb/>disturbed, were much more cautious whom they in
<lb/>structed: their language was ambiguous, and their
<lb/>terms, to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, were unintelligible: their subjects,
<lb/>indeed, required, some discretion, being nothing less
<lb/>than a ludicrous calculation of the age and duration
<pb n="181"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">177</mw>
<lb/>of jointured widows, and of the chances and expec
<lb/>tations of unmarried young ladies.</p>
<p><lb/>But what more even than their talking provoked
<lb/>her, was finding that the moment the act was over,
<lb/>when she cared not if their vociferation had been in
<lb/>cessant, one of them called out, <q>Come, be quiet, the
<lb/>dance is begun;</q> and then they were again all silent
<lb/>attention!</p>
<p>In the third act, however, she was mroe fortunate;
<lb/>the gentlemen again changed their places, and they
<lb/>were succeeded by others who came to the Opera not
<lb/>to hear themselves but the performers:  and as soon
<lb/>as she was permitted to listen, the voice of Pacchie
<lb/>rotti took from her all desire to hear any thing but
<lb/>itself.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>During the last dance she was discovered by <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert Floyer</persName>, who sauntering down fop's alley,
<lb/>stationed himself by her side, and whenever the <foreign lang="fre">figu
<lb/>rante</foreign> relieved the principal dancers, turned his eyes
<lb/>from the stage to her face, as better worth his notice,
<lb/>and equally destined for his amusement.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> too, who for some time had seen and
<lb/>watched her, now approached; he had observed with
<lb/>much satisfaction that her whole mind had been intent
	  <lb/>upon the performance, yet still the familiarity of <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert Floyer's</persName> admiration disturbed and perplexed
<lb/>him; he determined, therefore, to make an effort to
<lb/>satisfy his doubts by examining into his intentions:
<lb/>and, taking him apart, before the dance was quite
<lb/>over, <q>Well,</q> he said, <q>who is so handsome here as
<lb/>Harrel's ward?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes,</q> answered he, calmly, <q>she is handsome,
<lb/>but I don't like her expression.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/><q>No! why what is the fault of it?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Proud, cursed proud.  It is not the sort of
<lb/>woman I like.  If one says a civil thing to her, she
<lb/>only wishes one at the devil for one's pains.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, you have tried her, then, have you!  why you
<lb/>are not, in general, much given to say civil things.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, you know I said something of that sort to
	    <lb/>her once about <persName>Juliet</persName>, at the rehearsal.  Were not
<lb/>you by?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What, then, was that all?  and did you imagine
<lb/>one compliment would do your business with her?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, hang it, who ever dreams of complimenting
<lb/>the women now?  that's all at an end.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You won't find she thinks so, though; for, as
<lb/>you well say, her pride is unsufferable; and I, who
<lb/>have long known her, can assure you it does not di
<lb/>minish upon intimacy.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Perhaps not,but there's very pretty picking in
<lb/>3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. per annum! one would not think much of a
<lb/>little incumbrance upon such an estate.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Are you quite sure the estate is so considerable?
<lb/>Report is mightily given to magnify.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, I have pretty good intelligence:  though, after
<lb/>all, I don't know but I may be off; she'll take a con
<lb/>founded deal of time and trouble.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Monckton</persName>, too much of a man of interest and of the
<lb/>world to cherish that delicacy which covets universal
<lb/>admiration for the object of its fondness, then artfully
<lb/>enlarged upon the obstacles he already apprehended,
<lb/>and insinuated such others as he believed would be
<lb/>most likely to intimidate him.  But his subtilty was
<lb/>lost upon the impenetrable Baronet, who possessed
<lb/>that hard insensibility which obstinately pursues its
<pb n="183"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">179</mw>
<lb/>own course, deaf to what is said, and indifferent to
<lb/>what is thought.</p>
<p><lb/>Meanwhile the ladies were now making way to the
<lb/>coffee-room, though very slowly, on account of the
<lb/>crowd; and just as they got near the lobby, <persName>Cecilia</persName>
	  <lb/>perceived <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, who, immediately making him
<lb/>self, known to her, was offering his service to hand her
<lb/>out of the pit, when <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, not seeing or
<lb/>not heeding him, pressed forward, and said, <q>Will
<lb/>you let me have the honour, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, of taking
<lb/>care of you?</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whom he grew daily more disagreeable,
<lb/>coldly declined his assistance, while she readily ac
	  <lb/>cepted that which had first been offered her by <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Belfield</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>The haughty Baronet, extremely nettled, forced his
<lb/>way on, and rudely stalking up to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, mo
<lb/>tioned his hand for room to pass him, and said, <q>Make
<lb/>way, Sir!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Make way for <emph>me</emph>, Sir!</q> cried <persName>Belfield</persName>, opposing
<lb/>him with one hand, while with the other he held Ce
<lb/>cilia.</p>
<p><lb/><q>You, Sir? and who are you, Sir?</q> demanded the Baronet,
<lb/>disdainfully.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Of that, Sir, I shall give you an account whenever
<lb/>you please,</q> answered Belfield, with equal scorn.</p>
<p><lb/><q>What the devil do you mean, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Nothing very difficult to be understood,</q> replied
	  <lb/><persName>Belfield</persName>, and attempted to draw on <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who,
<lb/>much alarmed, was shrinking back.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Sir Robert</persName> then, swelling with rage, reproachfully
<lb/>turned to her, and said, <q>Will you suffer such an
<pb n="184"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">180</mw>
<lb/>impertinent fellow as that, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, to have
<lb/>the honour of taking your hand?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Belfield</persName>, with great indignation, demanded what
	  <lb/>he meant by the term impertinent fellow; and <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert</persName>, yet more insolently repeated it:  <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>extremely shocked, earnestly besought them both to
	  <lb/>be quiet; but <persName>Belfield</persName>, at the repetition of this insult,
<lb/>hastily let go her hand and put his own upon his sword,
	  <lb/>while <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, taking advantage of his situation in
<lb/>being a step higher than his antagonist, fiercely pushed
<lb/>him back, and descended into the lobby.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Belfield</persName>, enraged beyond endurance, instantly drew
	  <lb/>his sword, and <persName>Sir Robert</persName> was preparing to follow his
<lb/>example, when <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in an agony of fright, called
<lb/>out, <q>Good Heaven! will nobody interfere?</q>  And
<lb/>then a young man, forcing his way through the crowd,
<lb/>exclaimed, <q>For shame, for shame, gentlemen! is
<lb/>this a place for such violence!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Belfield</persName>, endeavouring to recover himself, put up
<lb/>his sword, and though in a voice half choaked with
<lb/>passion, said, <q>I thank you, Sir! I was off my guard.
<lb/>I beg pardon of the whole company.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/>Then, walking up to <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, he put into his
<lb/>hand a card with his name and direction, saying,
<lb/><q>With you, Sir, I shall be happy to settle what apo
<lb/>logies are necessary at your first leisure;</q> and hurried
<lb/>away.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, exclaiming aloud that he should soon
<lb/>teach him to whom he had been so impertinent, was
<lb/>immediately going to follow him, when the affrighted
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> again called out aloud, <q>Oh stop him!good
<lb/>God!  will nobody stop him!</q></p>

<p>
<lb/>The rapidity with which this angry scene had passed
<lb/>had filled her with amazement, and the evident re
<lb/>sentment of the Baronet upon her refusing his assis
<lb/>tance, gave her an immediate consciousness that she
<lb/>was herself the real cause of the quarrel;  while the
	  <lb/>manner in which he was preparing to follow <persName>Mr. Bel
<lb/>field</persName>, convinced her of the desperate scene which was
<lb/>likely to succeed; fear, therefore, overcoming every
<lb/>other feeling, forced from her this exclamation before
<lb/>she knew what she said.</p>
<p><lb/>The moment she had spoken, the young man who
<lb/>had already interposed again rushed forward, and
	  <lb/>seizing <persName>Sir Robert</persName> by the arm, warmly remonstrated
<lb/>against the violence of his proceedings, and being pre
<lb/>sently seconded by other gentlemen, almost com
<lb/>pelled him to give up his design.</p>
<p><lb/>Then, hastening to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>Be not alarmed, ma
<lb/>dam,</q> he cried, <q>all is over, and every body is safe.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, finding herself thus addressed by a gentle
<lb/>man she had never before seen, felt extremely ashamed
<lb/>of having rendered her interest in the debate so appa
<lb/>rent; she courtsied to him in some confusion, and
<lb/>taking hold of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s arm, hurried her back
<lb/>into the pit, in order to quit a crowd, of which she
<lb/>now found herself the principal object.  Curiosity,
<lb/>however, was universally excited, and her retreat
<lb/>served but to inflame it: some of the ladies, and most
<lb/>of the gentlemen, upon various pretences, returned
<lb/>into the pit merely to look at her, and in a few mi
<lb/>nutes the report was current that the young lady who
<lb/>had been the occasion of the quarrel, was dying with
<lb/>love for <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who had kept by her side during
<pb n="186"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">182</mw>
<lb/><sic corr="">the during </sic>the whole affair, felt thunder struck by the
<lb/>emotion she had shewn; <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> too, who had
<lb/>never quitted her, wished himself exposed to the same
	  <lb/>danger as <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, so that he might be honoured
<lb/>with the same concern: but they were both too much
<lb/>the dupes of their own apprehensions and jealousy,
<lb/>to perceive that what they instantly imputed to fond
<lb/>ness, proceeded simply from general humanity, acci
<lb/>dently united with the consciousness of being acces
<lb/>sary to the quarrel.</p>
<p><lb/>The young stranger who had officiated as mediator
<lb/>between the disputants, in a few moments followed
<lb/>her with a glass of water, which he had brought from
<lb/>the coffee-room, begging her to drink it and compose
<lb/>herself.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though she declined his civility with more
<lb/>vexation than gratitude, perceived, as she raised her
<lb/>eyes to thank him, that her new friend was a young man
<lb/>very strikingly elegant in his appearance.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> next, who, with her party, came back
<lb/>into the pit, ran up to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, crying, <q>O my dear
<lb/>creature, what a monstrous shocking thing!  You've
<lb/>no idea how I am frightened, do you know I hap
<lb/>pened to be quite at the further end of the coffee
<lb/>room when it began, and I could not get out to see
<lb/>what was the matter for ten ages; only conceive what
<lb/>a situation!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Would your fright, then, have been less,</q> said
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>had you been nearer the danger?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O Lord no, for when I came within sight I was
<lb/>fifty times worse!  I gave such a monstrous scream,
	    <lb/>that it quite made <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> start.  I dare say
<lb/>he'll tell me of it these hundred years: but really
<pb n="187"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">183</mw>
<lb/>when I saw them draw their swords I thought I should
<lb/>have died; I was so amazingly surprized you've no
<lb/>notion.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here she was interrupted by the re-appearance of
<lb/>the active stranger, who again advancing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>said, <q>I am in doubt whether the efforts I make to
<lb/>revive will please or irritate you; but though you re
<lb/>jected the last cordial I ventured to present you, per
<lb/>haps you will look with a more favourable eye towards
<lb/>that of which I am now the herald.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then, casting her eyes around, saw that he
<lb/>was followed by <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.  Full of dis
<lb/>pleasure both at this introduction and at his presence,
<lb/>she turned hastily to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and entreated him
<lb/>to enquire if the carriage was not ready.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, looking at her with all the exultaiton
<lb/>of new-raised vanity, said, with more softness than he
<lb/>had ever before addressed her, <q>Have you been
<lb/>frightened?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Every body, I believe, was frightened,</q> answered
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, with an air of dignity intended to check his
<lb/>rising expectations.</p>
<p><lb/><q>There was no sort of cause,</q> answered he: <q>the
<lb/>fellow did not know whom he spoke to, that was all.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Lord, <persName>Sir Robert</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q>how
<lb/>could you be so shocking as to draw your sword? you
<lb/>can't conceive how horrid it looked.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why I did not draw my sword,</q> cried he, <q>I
<lb/>only had my hand on the hilt.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Lord, did not you, indeed! well, every body said
<lb/>you did, and I'm sure I thought I saw five-and-twenty
<lb/>swords all at once.  I thought one of you would be
<lb/>killed every moment.  It was horrid disagreeable, I

	  <lb/><persName>Sir Robert</persName> was now called away by some gentle
<lb/>men; and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, earnest to be better in
<lb/>formed of <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s real sentiments, said, with affected
<lb/>concern, <q>At present this matter is merely ridicu
<lb/>lous; I am sorry to think in how short a time it may
<lb/>become more important<sic corr="."></sic></q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Surely,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName> with quickness, <q>some of
<lb/>their friends will interfere! surely upon so trifling a
<lb/>subject they will not be so mad, so inexcusable, as to
<lb/>proceed to more serious resentment!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Which ever of them,</q> said the stranger, <q>is
<lb/>most honoured by this anxiety, will be mad indeed to
<lb/>risk a life so valued!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Cannot you, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,</q> continued <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>too much alarmed to regard this insinuation, <q>speak
<lb/>with <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?  You are acquainted with him, I
<lb/>know: is it impossible you can follow him?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I will with pleasure do whatever you wish; but
	    <lb/>still if <persName>Sir Robert</persName></q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>O, as to <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, I am very sure,
<lb/>will undertake him; I will try to see him to night my
<lb/>self, and entreat him to exert all his influence.</q>
<lb/><q>Ah, madam,</q> cried the stranger archly, and low
<lb/>ering his voice, <q>those <emph>French beads</emph> and <emph>Bristol
<lb/>stones</emph> have not, I find, shone in vain!</q></p>
<p><lb/>At these words <persName>Cecilia</persName> recognized her white do
<lb/>mino acquaintance at the masquerade: she had before
<lb/>recollected his voice, but was too much perturbed to
<lb/>consider where or when she had heard it.</p>
<p><lb/><q>If <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>,</q> continued he, <q>does not speedily
<lb/>come forth with his plum friend, before the glittering
<lb/>of swords and spears is joined to that of jewels, the
<lb/>glare will be so resplendent, that he will fear to come
<lb/>within the influence of its rays.  Though, perhaps,

<lb/>that lady was too helpless to know in what manner to
<lb/>set about it; she could not tell where he was, she
<lb/>could not conjecture where he might be.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then rang for his own man, and upon en
<lb/>quiry, heard that he was, in all probability, at
	  <lb/><persName>Brookes's</persName> in <placeName>St. James's-Street</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb/>She then begged <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> would write to him.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> knew not what to say.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, therefore, equally quick in forming and
<lb/>executing her designs, wrote to him herself, and en
<lb/>treated that without losing an instant he would find
<lb/>out his friend <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, and endeavour to
	  <lb/>effect an accommodation between him and <persName>Mr. Bel
<lb/>field</persName>, with whom he had had a dispute at the Opera
<lb/>House.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The man soon returned with an answer that <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel</persName> would not fail to obey her commands.</p>
<p><lb/>She determined to sit up till he came home, in order
<lb/>to learn the event of the negociation.  She considered
<lb/>herself as the efficient cause of the quarrel, yet scarce
<lb/>knew how or in what to blame herself; the behaviours
	  <lb/>of <persName>Sir Robert</persName> had always been offensive to her; she
<lb/>disliked his manners, and detested his boldness; and
<lb/>she had already shewn her intention to accept the as
<lb/>sistance of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> before he had followed her
<lb/>with an offer of his own.  She was uncertain, indeed,
<lb/>whether he had remarked what had passed; but she
<lb/>had reason to think that, so circumstanced, to have
<lb/>changed her purpose, would have been construed into
<lb/>an encouragement that might have authorised his
<lb/>future presumption of her favour.  All she could find
<lb/>to regret, with regard to herself, was wanting the
<lb/>presence of mind to have refused the civilities of both.</p>

<p>
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, though really sorry at the state of hte
<lb/>affair, regarded herself as so entirely unconcerned
<lb/>in it, that, easily wearied when out of company, she
<lb/>soon grew sleepy, and retired to her own room.</p>
<p><lb/>the anxious <persName>Cecilia</persName>, hoping every instant the re
<lb/>turn of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, sat up by herself: but it was
<lb/>not till near four o'clock in the morning that he made
<lb/>his appearance.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Well, Sir,</q>said she, the moment she saw him,
<lb/><q>I fear by your coming home so late you have had
<lb/>much trouble, but I hope it has been successful?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Great, however, was her mortification when he an
<lb/>swered that he had not even seen the Baronet, hav
<lb/>ing been engaged himself in so particular a manner,
<lb/>that he could not possibly break from his party till
<lb/>past three o'clock, at which time he drove to the
	  <lb/>house of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, but heard that he was not yet
<lb/>come home.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though much disgustd by such a specimen
<lb/>of insensibility towards a man whom he pretended to
<lb/>call his friend, would not leave him till he had pro
<lb/>mised to arise as soon as it was light, and make an
<lb/>effort to recover the time lost.</p>
<p><lb/>She was now no longer surprised either at the
<lb/>debts of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, or at his <emph>particular occasions</emph>
<lb/>for money.  She was convinced he spent half the
<lb/>night in gaming, and the consequences, however
<lb/>dreadful, were but natural.  That <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>
<lb/>also did the same was a matter of much less impor
<lb/>tance to her, but that the life of any man should
<lb/>through her means be endangered, disturbed her in
<lb/>expressibly.</p>
<p><lb/>She went, however to bed, but arose again at six
<pb n="192"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">188</mw>
<lb/>o'clock, and dressed herself by candle light.  In an
<lb/>hour's time she sent to enquire if <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was
<lb/>stirring, and hearing he was asleep, gave orders to
<lb/>have him called.  Yet he did not rise till eight o'clock,
<lb/>nor could all her messages or expostulations drive
<lb/>him out of the house till nine.</p>
<p><lb/>He was scarcely gone before <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> ar
<lb/>rived, who now for the first time had the satisfaction
<lb/>of finding her alone.</p>
<p><lb/><q>You are very good for coming so early,</q> cried
<lb/>she; <q>have you seen <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?  Have you had
<lb/>any conversation with him?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Alarmed at her eagerness, and still more at seeing
<lb/>by her looks the sleepless night she had passed, he
<lb/>made at first no reply; and when, with increasing
<lb/>impatience, she repeated her question, he only said,
	  <lb/><q>Has <persName>Belfield</persName> ever visited you since he had the ho
<lb/>nour of meeting you at my house?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, never.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Have you seen him often in public?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, I have never seen him at all but the evening
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> received masks, and last night at the
<lb/>Opera.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Is it then for the safety of both; the cause of their
<lb/>quarrel was so trifling, that I cannot bear to thinks its
<lb/>consequence should be serious.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But do you not wish better to one of them than
<lb/>to the other?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>As a matter of justice I do, but not from any
<lb/>partiality: Sir Robert was undoubtedly the aggressor,
<lb/>and <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, though at first too fiery, was cer
<lb/>tainly ill used.</q></p>

	  <lb/>The candour of this speech recovered <persName>Mr. Monck
<lb/>ton</persName> from his apprehensions; and carefully observing
<lb/>her looks while he spoke, he gave her the following
<lb/>account.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>That he had hastened to <persName>Belfield's</persName> lodgings the
<lb/>moment he had left the Opera-house, and, after re
<lb/>peated denials, absolutely forced himself into his
<lb/>room, where he was quite alone, and in much agita
<lb/>tion: he conversed with him for more than an hour
<lb/>upon the subject of the quarrel, but found he so
	  <lb/>warmly resented the personal insult given him by <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert</persName>, that no remonstrance had any effect in mak
<lb/>ing him alter his resolution of demanding satis
<lb/>faction.</p>
<p><lb/><q>And could you bring him to consent to no com
<lb/>promise before you left him?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>.<sic corr=''></sic></p>
<p><lb/><q>No; for before I got to himthe challenge had
<lb/>been sent.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>The challenge! good heaven!and do you know
<lb/>the event?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I called again this morning at his lodgings, but he
<lb/>was not returned home.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And was it impossible to follow him? Were there
<lb/>no means to discover whither he was gone?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>None; to elude all pursuit, he went out before
<lb/>any body in the house was stirring, and took his ser
<lb/>vant with him.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Have you then been to <persName>Sir Robert</persName>?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>I have been to <placeName>Cavendish-Square</placeName>, but there, it
<lb/>seems, he had not appeared all night; I traced him,
<lb/>through his servants, from the Opera to a gaming
<lb/>house, where I found he had amused himself till this
<lb/>morning.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The uneasiness of <persName>Cecilia</persName> now encreased every
<pb n="194"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">190</mw>
<lb/>moment; and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, seeing he had no other
<lb/>chance of satisfying her, offered his service to go
<lb/>again in search of both the gentlemen, and endeavour
<lb/>to bring her better information.  She accepted the
<lb/>proposal with gratitude, and he departed.</p>
<p><lb/>Soon after, she was joined by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who,
<lb/>though seized with all the horrors of jealousy at
<lb/>sight of her apprehensions, was so desirous to relieve
<lb/>them, that without even making any merit of oblig
<lb/>ing her, he almost instantly set out upon the same er
<lb/>rand that employed <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, and determined
<lb/>not to mention his design till he found whether it
<lb/>would enable him to bring her good tidings.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>He was scarce gone when she was told that <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Delvile</persName> begged to have the honour of speaking to
<lb/>her.  Surprised at this condescension, she desired he
<lb/>might immediately be admitted; but much was her
<lb/>surprise augmented, when, instead of seeing her os
<lb/>tentatious guardian, she again beheld her masquerade
<lb/>friend, the white domino.</p>
<p><lb/>He intreated her pardon for an intrusion neither
<lb/>authorized by acquaintance nor by business, though
<lb/>somewhat, he hoped, palliated, by his near connec
<lb/>tion with one who was privileged to take an interest
<lb/>in her affairs: and then, hastening to the motives
<lb/>which had occasioned his visit, <q>when I had the ho
<lb/>nour,</q> he said, <q>of seeing you last night at the
<lb/>Opera-house, the dispute which had just happened
<lb/>between two gentlemen, seemed to give you an un
<lb/>easiness which could not but be painful to all who ob
<lb/>served it, and as among that number I was not the
<lb/>least moved, you will forgive, I hope, my eagerness
<lb/>to be the first to bring you intelligence that nothing
<lb/>fatal has happened, or is likely to happen.</q></p>

<lb/><q id="CE5">You do me, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE6">much honour;
<lb/>and indeed you relieve me from a suspense extremely
<lb/>disagreeable.  The accommodation, I suppose, was
<lb/>brought about this morning?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="AR3">I find,</q> answered he, smiling <q id="AR4">you now expect
<lb/>too much; but hope is never so elastic as when it
<lb/>springs from the ruins of terror.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What then is the matter?  Are they, at last, not
<lb/>safe?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, perfectly safe; but I cannot tell you they
<lb/>have never been in danger.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Well, if it is now over I am contented: but you
<lb/>will very much oblige me, Sir, if you will inform me
<lb/>what has passed.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You oblige me, madam, by the honour of your
<lb/>commands.  I saw but too much reason to apprehend
<lb/>that measures the most violent would follow the
<lb/>affray of last night; yet as I found that the quarrel
<lb/>had been accidental, and the offence unpremeditated,
<lb/>I thought it not absolutely impossible that an expe
<lb/>ditious mediation might effect a compromise:  at
<lb/>least it was worth trying: for though wrath slowly
<lb/>kindled or long nourished is sullen and untractable,
<lb/>the sudden anger that has not had time to impress the
<lb/>mind with a deep sense of injury, will, when gently
<lb/>mangaged, be sometimes appeased with the same
<lb/>quickness it is excited: I hoped, therefore, that some
	    <lb/>trifling concession from <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, as the aggres
<lb/>sor,</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Ah Sir!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that, I fear, was not to
<lb/>be obtained!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Not by me, I must own,</q>he answered; <q>but I
<lb/>was not willing to think of the difficulty, and there
<lb/>fore ventured to make the proposal; nor did I leave
<pb n="196"/>

<lb/>the Opera-house till I had used every possible ar
	    <lb/>gument to persuade <persName>Sir Robert</persName> an apology would
<lb/>neither stain his courage nor his reputation.  But his
<lb/>spirit brooked not the humiliation.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE9">Spirit!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE10">how mild a word!
<lb/>What, then, could poor <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> resolve
<lb/>upon?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>That, I believe, took him very little time to de
<lb/>cide.  I discovered by means of a gentleman at the
<lb/>Opera, who was acquainted with him, where he
<lb/>lived, and I waited upon him with an intention to
<lb/>offer my services towards settling the affair by arbi
<lb/>tration: for since you call him <emph>poor</emph> <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, I
<lb/>think you will permit me, without offence to his an
<lb/>tagonist, to own that his gallantry, though too im
<lb/>petuous for commendation, engaged me in his in
<lb/>terest.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hope you don't think,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that an
<lb/>offence to his antagonist must necessarily be an of
<lb/>fence to me?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Whatever I may have thought,</q> answered he,
<lb/>looking at her with evident surprise, <q>I certainly did
<lb/>not wish that a sympathy offensive and defensive had
<lb/>been concluded between you.  I could not, however,
<lb/>gain access to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> last night, but the affair
<lb/>dwelt upon my mind, and this morning I called at his
<lb/>lodgings as soon as it was light.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>How good you have been!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>your
<lb/>kind offices have not, I hope, all proved ineffectual!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>So valourous a <name>Don Quixote</name>,</q> returned he,
<lb/>laughing, <q>certainly merited a faithful Esquire! he
<lb/>was, however, gone out, and nobody knew whither.
<lb/>About half an hour ago I called upon him again; he
<lb/>was then just returned home.</q></p>
<pb n="197"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">193</mw>
<p>
<lb/><q>Well, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I saw him; the affair was over; and in a short
<lb/>time he will be able, if you will allow him so much
<lb/>hono<sic corr=""></sic>ur, to thank you for these enquiries.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>He is then wounded?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>He is a little hurt, but <persName>Sir Robert</persName> is perfectly
	    <lb/>safe.  <persName>Belfield</persName> fired first, and missed; the Baronet
<lb/>was not successless.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am grieved to hear it, indeed! and where is the
<lb/>wound?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>The ball entered his right side, and the moment
<lb/>he felt it, he fired his second pistol in the air.  This
<lb/>I heard from his servant.  He was brought home
<lb/>carefully and slowly; no surgeon had been up on the
<lb/>spot, but one was called to him immediately.  I
<lb/>stayed to enquire his opinion after the wound had been
<lb/>dressed: he told me he had extracted the ball, and
<lb/>assured me <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> was not in any danger.  Your
<lb/>alarm, madam, last night, which had always been pre
<lb/>sent to me, then encouraged me to take the liberty of
<lb/>waiting upon you; for I concluded you could yet
<lb/>have had no certain intelligence, and thought it best
<lb/>to let the plain and simple fact outrun the probable
<lb/>exaggeration of rumour.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for his attention; and Mrs.
<lb/>Harrel then making her appearance, he arose and
<lb/>said, <q>Had my father known the honour I have had
<lb/>this morning of waiting upon <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I am sure
<lb/>I should have been charged with his compliments, and
<lb/>such a commission would somewhat have lessened the
<lb/>presumption of this visit; but I feared lest while I
<lb/>should be making interest for my credentials, the pre
<lb/>tence of my embassy might be lost, and other couriers,

<lb/>less scrupulous, might obtain previous audiences, and
<lb/>anticipate my dispatches.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then took his leave.</p>
<p><lb/><q>This white domino, at last, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
	  <lb/><q>is the son of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>! and thence the know
<lb/>ledge of my situation which gave me so much surprise:
<lb/>a son how infinitely unlike his father?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>and as unlike his mother
<lb/>too, for I assure you she is more proud and haughty
<lb/>even than the old gentleman.  I hate the very sight
<lb/>of her, for she keeps every body in such awe that
<lb/>there's nothing but restraint in her presence.  But the
<lb/>son is a very pretty young man, and much admired
<lb/>though I have only seen him in public, for none of the
<lb/>family visit here.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who now soon returned, was not a
<lb/>little surprised to find that all the intelligence he
<lb/>meant to communicate was already known: and not
<lb/>the more pleased to hear that the white domino, to
<lb/>whom before he owed no goodwill, had thus officially
<lb/>preceded him.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who also came just after him, had been
<lb/>so little satisfied with the result of his enquiries, that
<lb/>from the fear of encreasing the uneasiness of <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>he determined not to make known whither he had
<lb/>been; but he soon found his forbearance was of no
<lb/>avail, as she was already acquainted with the duel
<lb/>and its consequences.  Yet his unremitting desire to
<lb/>oblige her urged him twice in the course of the same
<lb/>day to again call at <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>'s lodgings, in order
<lb/>to bring her thence fresh and unsolicited intelligence.</p>
<p><lb/>Before breakfast was quite over, <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, out
<lb/>of breath with eagerness, came to tell the news of the
<pb n="199"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">195</mw>
	  <lb/>duel, in her way to <emph>church</emph>, as it was now <name>Sunday</name>
	  <lb/>morning; and soon after <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName>, who also was
<lb/>followed by other ladies, brought the same account,
<lb/>which by all was addressed to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with expres
<lb/>sions of concern that convinced her, to her infinite
<lb/>vexation, she was generally regarded as the person
<lb/>chiefly interested in the accident.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> did not return till late, but then seemed
<lb/>in very high spirits: <q> <persName>Miss Beverly</persName>,</q> he cried, <q>I
<lb/>bring you news that will repay all your fright; Sir
<lb/>Robert is not only safe, but is come off conqueror.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am very sorry, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely
<lb/>provoked to be thus congratulated, <q>that any body
<lb/>conquered, or any body was vanquished.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>There is no need for sorrow,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/><q>or for any thing but joy, for he has not killed his
<lb/>man; the victory, therefore will neither cost him a
<lb/>flight nor a trial.  To-day he means to wait upon you,
<lb/>and lay his laurels at your feet.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>He means, then, to take very fruitless trouble,</q>
<lb/>said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>for I have not any ambition to be so
<lb/>honoured.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Ah, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> returned he, laughing, <q>this
<lb/>won't do now! it might have passed a little while
<lb/>ago, but it won't do now, I promise you!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though much displeased by this accusation,
<lb/>found that disclaiming it only excited further raillery,
<lb/>and therefore prevailed upon herself to give him a
<lb/>quiet hearing, and scarce any reply.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>At dinner, when <persName>Sir Robert</persName> arrived, the dislike she
<lb/>had originally taken to him, encreased already into
<lb/>disgust by his behaviour the preceding evening, was
<lb/>now fixed into the strongest aversion by the horror
<pb n="200"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">196</mw>
<lb/>she conceived of his fierceness, and the indignation
<lb/>she felt excited by his arrogance.  He seemed, from
<lb/>the success of this duel, to think himself raised to the
<lb/>highest pinnacle of human glory; triumph sat exult
<lb/>ing on his brow; he looked down on whoever he
<lb/>deigned to look at all, and shewed that he thought
<lb/>his notice an honour, however imperious the manner
<lb/>in which it was accorded.</p>
<p><lb/>Upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, he cast, an eye of more
<lb/>complacency; he now believed her subdued, and his
<lb/>vanity revelled in the belief: her anxiety had so
<lb/>thoroughly satisfied him of her love, that she had
<lb/>hardly the power left to undeceive him; her silence
<lb/>he only attributed to admiration, her coldness to fear,
<lb/>and her reserve to shame.</p>
<p><lb/>Sickened by insolence so undisguised and unautho
<lb/>rised, and incensed at the triumph of his successful
<lb/>brutality, <persName>Cecilia</persName> with pain kept her seat, and with
<lb/>vexation reflected upon the necessity she was under of
<lb/>passing so large a portion of her time in company to
<lb/>which she was so extremely averse.</p>
<p><lb/>After dinner, when <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was talking of her
<lb/>party for the evening, of which <persName>Cecilia</persName> declined
	  <lb/>making one, <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, with a sort of proud humi
<lb/>lity, that half feared rejection, and half proclaimed an
<lb/>indifference to meeting it, said, <q>I don't much care
<lb/>for going further myself, if <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> will give
<lb/>me the honour of taking my tea with her.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, regarding him with much surprise, an
<lb/>swered that she had letters to write into the country
<lb/>which would confine her to her own room for the rest
<lb/>of the evening.  The Baronet, looking at his watch,
<lb/>instantly cried, <q>Faith, that is very fortunate, for I
<pb n="201"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">197</mw>
<lb/>have just recollected an engagement at the other end
<lb/>of the town which had slipped my memory.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Soon after they were all gone, <persName>Cecilia</persName> received a
	  <lb/>note from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, begging the favour of her
<lb/>company the next morning to breakfast.  She readily
<lb/>accepted the invitaiton, though she was by no means
<lb/>prepared, by the character she had heard of her, to
<lb/>expect much pleasure from an acquaintance with that
<lb/>lady.</p></div>

	<p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Cecilia</persName> the next morning, between nine and ten
	  <lb/>o'clock, went to <placeName>St. James's square</placeName>; she found nobody
<lb/>immediately ready to receive her, but in a short time
	  <lb/>was waited upon by <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>After the usual salutations, <q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> he
<lb/>said, <q>I have given express orders to my people, that
<lb/>I may not be interruped while I have the pleasure
<lb/>of passing some minutes in conversation with you,
	    <lb/>before you are presented to <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then, with an air of solemnity, he led her to a
<lb/>seat; and having himself taken possession of another,
<lb/>continued his speech.</p>
<p><lb/><q>I have received information, from authority
<lb/>which I cannot doubt, that the indiscretion of certain
	    <lb/>of your admirers last <name>Saturday</name> at the Opera-house,
<lb/>occasioned a disturbance which to a young woman of
<lb/>delicacy I should imagine must be very alarming: now
<pb n="202"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">198</mw>
<lb/>as I consider myself concerned in your fame and wel
<lb/>fare, from regarding you as my ward, I think it is in
<lb/>cumbent upon me to make enquires into such of your
<lb/>affairs as become public; for I should feel in some
<lb/>measure disgraced myself, should it appear to the
<lb/>world, while you are under my guardianship, that there
<lb/>was any want of propriety in the direction of your
<lb/>conduct.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, not much flattered by this address, gravely
<lb/>answered, that she fancied the affair had been mis
<lb/>represented to him.</p>
<p><lb/><q>I am not much addicted,</q> he replied, <q>to give
<lb/>ear to any thing lightly; you must therefore permit
<lb/>me to enquire into the merits of the cause, and then
<lb/>to draw my own inferences.  And let me, at the same
<lb/>time, assure you, there is no other young lady who
<lb/>has any right to expect such an attention from me.  I
<lb/>must begin by begging you to inform me, upon what
<lb/>grounds the two gentlemen in question, for such, by
<lb/>courtesy, I presume they are called, thought them
<lb/>selves entitled publicly to dispute your favour?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>My favour, Sir!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much amazed.</p>
<p><lb/><q>My dear,</q> said he, with a complacency meant to
<lb/>give her courage, <q>I know the question is difficult
<lb/>for a young lady to answer; but be not abashed, I
<lb/>should be sorry to distress you, and mean to the
<lb/>utmost of my power to save your blushes.  Do not,
<lb/>therefore, fear me; consider me as your guardian,
<lb/>and assure yourself I am perfectly well disposed to
<lb/>consider you as my ward.  Acquaint me, then, freely,
<lb/>what are the pretensions of these gentlemen?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>To me, Sir, they have, I believe, no pretensions
<lb/>at all.</q></p>
<pb n="203"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">199</mw>
<p>
<lb/><q>I see you are shy,</q> returned he, with encreasing
<lb/>gentleness; <q>I see you cannot be easy with me; and
<lb/>when I consider how little you are accustomed to me,
<lb/>I do not wonder.  But pray take courage; I think it
<lb/>necessary to inform myself of your affairs, and there
<lb/>fore I beg you will speak to me with freedom.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, more and more mortified by this humiliating
<lb/>condescension, again assured him he had been misin
<lb/>formed; and was again, though discredited, praised
<lb/>for her modesty; when, to her great relief, they were
<lb/>interrupted by the entrance of her friend the <emph>white
<lb/>domino</emph>.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q><persName>Mortimer</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>I understand you
<lb/>have already had the pleasure of seeing this young
<lb/>lady?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, Sir,</q> he answered; <q>I have more than once
<lb/>had that happiness, but I have never had the honour
<lb/>of being introduced to her.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, then,</q> said the father, <q>I must
	    <lb/>present to you <persName>Mr. Mortimer Delvile</persName>, my son; and
	    <lb/><persName>Mortimer</persName>, in <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> I desire you will remem
<lb/>ber that you respect a ward of your father's.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I will not, Sir,</q> answered he, <q>forget an in
<lb/>junction my own inclinations had already out-run.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mortimer Delvile</persName> was tall and finely formed; his
<lb/>features, though not handsome, were full of expres
<lb/>sion; and a noble openness of manners and address
<lb/>spoke the elegance of his education, and the liberality
<lb/>of his mind.</p>
<p><lb/>When this introduction was over, a more general
	  <lb/>conversation took place, till <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, suddenly
	  <lb/>rising, said to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>You will pardon me, <persName>Miss

<lb/>Beverley</persName>, if I leave you for a few minutes; one of my
<lb/>tenants sets out to-morrow morning for my estate in
<lb/>the North, and he has been two hours waiting to speak
<lb/>with me.  But if my son is not particularly engaed,
<lb/>I am sure he will be so good as to do the honours of
<lb/>the house till his mother is ready to receive you.</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then, graciously waving his hand, he quitted
<lb/>the room.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>My father,</q> cried young <persName>Delvile</persName>, <q>has left me an
<lb/>office, which, could I execute it as perfectly as I shall
<lb/>willingly, would be performed without a fault.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am very sorry,</q>said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that I have so
<lb/>much mistaken your hour of breakfast; but let me not
<lb/>be any restraint upon you; I shall find a book, or a
	    <lb/>newspaper, or something to fill up the time till <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName> honours me with a summons.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You can only be a restraint upon me,</q>answered
<lb/>he, <q>commanding me from your presence.  I
<lb/>breakfasted long ago, and am now just come from
<lb/><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>.  I had the pleasure, this morning, of
<lb/>being admitted into his room.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And how, Sir, did you find him?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Not so well, I fear, as he thinks himself; but he
<lb/>was in high spirits, and surrounded by his friends,
<lb/>whom he was entertaining with all the gaiety of a
<lb/>man in full health, and entirely at his ease; though
<lb/>I perceived, by the frequent changes of his counte
<lb/>nance, signs of pain and indisposition, that made me,
<lb/>however pleased with his conversation, think it neces
<lb/>sary to shorten my own visit, and to hint to those who
<lb/>were near me the propriety of leaving him quiet.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Did you see his surgeon, Sir?</q></p>
<pb n="205"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">201</mw>
<p>
<lb/><q>No; but he told me he should only have one
<lb/>dressing more of his wound, and then get rid of the
<lb/>whole business by running into the country.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Were you acquainted with him, Sir, before this
<lb/>accident?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, not at all; but the little I have seen of him
	    <lb/>has strangely interested me in his favour.  At <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel's</persName> masquerade, where I first met with him, I
<lb/>was extremely entertained by his humourthough
<lb/>there, perhaps, as I had also the honour of first seeing
<lb/><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I might be too happy to feel much
<lb/>difficulty in being pleased.  And even at the opera he
<lb/>had the advantage of finding me in the same favour
<lb/>able disposition, as I had long distinguished you be
<lb/>fore I had taken any notice of him.  I must, however,
<lb/>confess I did not think his anger that evening quite
<lb/>without provocationbut I beg your pardon, I may
<lb/>perhaps be mistaken, and you, who know the whole
<lb/>affair, must undoubtedly be better able to account for
<lb/>what happened.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here he fixed his eyes upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with a look of
<lb/>curiosity that seemed eager to penetrate into her sen
<lb/>timents of the two antagonists.</p>
<p><lb/><q>No, certainly,</q> she answered; <q>he had all the
<lb/>provocation that ill-breeding could give him.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And do you, madam,</q> cried he, with much sur
<lb/>prise, <q>judge of this matter with such severity?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, not with severity, simply with can
<lb/>dour.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>With candour?  Alas, then, poor <persName>Sir Robert</persName>!
<lb/>Severity were not half so bad a sign for him!</q></p>
<p><lb/>A servant now came in, to acquaint <persName>Cecilia</persName> that
	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> waited breakfast for her.</p>

<p>
<lb/>This summons was immediately followed by the re
	  <lb/>entrance of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, who, taking her hand, said
<lb/>he would himself present her to his lady, and with
<lb/>much graciousness assured her of a kind reception.</p>
<p><lb/>The ceremonies preceding this interview, added to
<lb/>the character she had already heard of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb/>made <persName>Cecilia</persName> heartily wish it over; but, assuming all
<lb/>the courage in her power, she determined to support
<lb/>herself with a spirit that should struggle against
<lb/>the ostentatious superiority she was prepared to
<lb/>expect.</p>
<p><lb/>She found her seated upon a sofa, from which, how
<lb/>ever, she arose at her approach; but the moment Ce
<lb/>cilia beheld her, all the unfavourable impressions with
<lb/>which she came into her presence immediately vanish
<lb/>ed, and that respect which the formalities of her intro
<lb/>duction had failed to inspire, her air, figure, and
<lb/>countenance instantaneously excited.</p>
<p><lb/>She was not more than fifty years of age; her
<lb/>complexion, though faded, kept the traces of her for
<lb/>mer loveliness; her eyes, though they had lost their
<lb/>youthful fire, retained a lustre that evinced their pri
<lb/>meval brilliancy; and the fine symmetry of her fea
<lb/>tures, still uninjured by the siege of time, not only in
<lb/>dicated the perfection of her juvenile beauty, but still
<lb/>laid claim to admiration in every beholder.</p>
<p><lb/>Her carriage was lofty and commanding; but the
<lb/>dignity to which high birth and conscious superiority
<lb/>gave rise, was so judiciously regulated by good sense,
<lb/>and so happily blended with politeness, that though
<lb/>the world at large envied or hated her, the few for
<lb/>whom she had herself any regard, she was infallibly
<lb/>certain to captivate.</p>
<pb n="207"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">203</mw>
<p>
<lb/>The surprise and admiration with which <persName>Cecilia</persName> at
	  <lb/>the first glance was struck, proved reciprocal: <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName>, though prepared for youth and beauty, ex
<lb/>pected not to see a countenance so intelligent, nor
<lb/>manners so well formed as those of <persName>Cecilia</persName>: thus mu
<lb/>tually astonished and mutually pleased, their first sa
<lb/>lutations were accompanied by looks so flattering to
<lb/>both, that each saw in the other, an immediate pre
<lb/>possession in her favour; and from the moment that
<lb/>they met, they seemed instinctively impelled to
<lb/>admire.</p>
<p><lb/><q>I have promised <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, madam,</q> said
<lb/><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> to his lady, <q>that you would give her a
<lb/>kind reception; and I need not remind you that my
<lb/>promises are always held sacred.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But I hope you have not also promised,</q> cried
<lb/>she, with quickness, <q>that I should give <emph>you</emph> a kind re
<lb/>ception, for I feel at this very moment extremely in
<lb/>clined to quarrel with you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why so, madam?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>For not bringing us together sooner; for now I
<lb/>have seen her, I already look back with regret to the
<lb/>time I have lost without the pleasure of knowing her.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What a claim is this,</q> cried young Delville, <q>upon
<lb/>the benevolence of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>! for if she had not
<lb/>now the indulgence by frequent and diligent visits to
<lb/>make some reparation, she must consider herself as
<lb/>responsible for the dissension she will occasion.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>If peace depends upon my visits,</q> answered Ce
<lb/>cilia, <q>it may immediately be proclaimed; were it to
<lb/>be procured only by my absence, I know not if I should
<lb/>so readily agree to the conditions.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I must request of you, madam,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
<pb n="208"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">204</mw>
<lb/><q>that when my son and I retire, you will bestow
<lb/>half an hour upon this young lady, in making enqui
<lb/>ries concerning the disturbance last night at the Opera
<lb/>House.  I have not, myself, so much time to spare,
<lb/>as I have several appointments for this morning; but
<lb/>I am sure you will not object to the office, as I know
<lb/>you to be equally anxious with myself, that the mino
<lb/>rity of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> should pass without reproach.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Not only her minority, but her maturity,</q> cried
	  <lb/>young <persName>Delvile</persName>, warmly; <q>and not only her maturity,
<lb/>but her decline of life will pass, I hope, not merely
<lb/>without reporach, but with fame and applause!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hope so too,</q> replied <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>; <q>I wish
<lb/>her well through every stage of her life; but for her
<lb/>minority alone it is my business to do more than wish.
<lb/>For that, I feel my own honour and my own credit
<lb/>concerned; my honour, as I gave it to the Dean that
<lb/>I would superintend her conduct; and my credit, as
<lb/>the world is acquainted with the claim she has to my
<lb/>protection.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I will not make any enquiries,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb/>turning to <persName>Cecilia</persName> with a sweetness that recompensed
<lb/>her for the haughtiness of her guardian, <q>till I have
<lb/>had some opportunity of convincing <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,
<lb/>that my regard for her merits they should be an
<lb/>swered.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You see, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
	  <lb/><q>how little reason you had to be afraid of us; <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName> is as much disposed in your favour as myself,
<lb/>and as desirous to be of service to you.  Endeavour,
<lb/>therefore, to cast off this timidity, and to make your
<lb/>self easy.  You must come to us often; use will do
<pb n="209"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">205</mw>
<lb/>more towards removing your fears, than all the encou
<lb/>ragement we can give you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But what are the fears,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb/><q>that <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> can have to remove? unless, in
<lb/>deed, she apprehends her visits will make us encroach
<lb/>ers, and that the more we are favoured with her pre
<lb/>sence, the less we shall bear her absence.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Pray, son,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>what was the
<lb/>name of the person who was <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>'s op
<lb/>ponent?  I have forgotten it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Belfield, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>True; it is a name I am perfectly unacquainted
<lb/>with:  however, he may possibly be a very good sort
	    <lb/>of man; but certainly his opposing himself to <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert Floyer</persName>, a man of some family, a gentleman,
<lb/>rich, and allied to some people of distinction, was
<lb/>a rather strange circumstance.  I mean not, however,
<lb/>to prejudge the case; I will hear it fairly stated; and
<lb/>I am the more disposed to be cautious in what I pro
<lb/>nounce, because I am persuaded <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> has
<lb/>too much sense to let my advice be thrown away upon
<lb/>her.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hope so, Sir; but with respect to the disturbance
<lb/>at the opera, I know not that I have the least occa
<lb/>sion to trouble you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>If your measures,</q> said he, very gravely, <q>are
<lb/>already taken, the dean your uncle prevailed upon me
<lb/>accept a very useless office; but if any thing is yet un
<lb/>decided, it will not, perhaps, be amiss that I should be
<lb/>consulted.  Mean time, I will only recommend to you
<lb/>to consider, that <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> is a person whose name
	    <lb/>nobody has heard, and that a connection with <persName>Sir Ro
<pb n="210"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">206</mw>
<lb/>bert Floyer</persName> would certainly be very honourable for
<lb/>you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Indeed, Sir,</q> said, <persName>Cecilia</persName>,<q>here is some great
<lb/>mistake; neither of these gentlemen, I believe, think
<lb/>of me at all.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>They have taken, then,</q> cried young <persName>Delvile</persName>
<lb/>with a laugh, <q>a very extraordinary method to prove
<lb/>their indifference!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>The affairs of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>,</q> continued
<lb/><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>are indeed, I am informed, in some
<lb/>disorder; but he has a noble estate, and your fortune
<lb/>would soon clear all its incumbrances.  Such an al
<lb/>liance, therefore, would be mutually advantageous:
<lb/>but what would result from a union with such a per
<lb/>son as <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?  He is of no family, though in
<lb/>that perhaps, you would not be very scrupulous; but
<lb/>neither has he any money; what, then, recommends
<lb/>him?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>To me, Sir, nothing!</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q>And to me,</q> cried young <persName>Delvile</persName>, <q>almost every
<lb/>thing!  He has wit, spirit, and understanding; ta
<lb/>lents to create admiration; and qualities, I believe,
<lb/>to engage esteem!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You speak warmly,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>; <q>but if
<lb/>such is his character, he merits your earnestness.
<lb/>What is it you know of him?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Not enough, perhaps,</q> answered he, <q>to coolly
<lb/>justify my praise; but he is one of those whose first
<lb/>appearance takes the mind by surprise, and leaves the
<lb/>judgment to make afterwards such terms as it can.
<lb/>Will you, madam, when he is recovered, permit me
<lb/>to introduce him to you?</q></p>
<pb n="211"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">207</mw>
<p>
<lb/><q>Certainly,</q> said she, smiling; <q>but have a care
<lb/>your recommendation does not disgrace your discern
<lb/>ment.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Ths warmth of disposition, <persName>Mortimer</persName>,</q> cried
<lb/><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>produces nothing but difficulties and
<lb/>trouble: you neglect the connections I point out, and
<lb/>which a little attention might render serviceable as
<lb/>well as honourable, and run precipitately into form
<lb/>ing such as can do you no good among people of rank,
<lb/>and are not only profitless in themselves, but gene
<lb/>rally lead you into expence and inconvenience.  You
<lb/>are now of an age to correct this rashness:  think,
<lb/>therefore, better of your own consequence, than thus
<lb/>idly to degrade yourself, by forming friendships with
<lb/>every shewy adventurer that comes in your way.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>I know not, Sir,</q> answered he, <q>how <persName>Mr. Bel
<lb/>field</persName> deserves to be called an adventurer:  he is not,
<lb/>indeed, rich; but he is in a profession where parts
<lb/>such as his seldom fail to acquire riches; however, as
<lb/>to me his wealth can be of no consequence, why should
<lb/>my regard to him wait for it? if he is a young man of
<lb/>worth and honour </q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Mortimer,</q> interrupted <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>whatever
<lb/>he is, we know he is not a man of rank; and whatever
<lb/>he may be, we know he cannot become a man of fa
	    <lb/>mily, and consequently for <persName>Mortimer Delvile</persName> he is no
<lb/>companion.  If you can render him any service, I
<lb/>shall commend your so doing; it becomes your birth,
<lb/>it becomes your station in life to assist individuals,
<lb/>and promote the general good:  but never in your zeal
<lb/>for others forget what is due to yourself, and to the
<lb/>ancient and honourable house from which you are
<lb/>sprung.</q></p>

<p>
<lb/><q>But can we entertain <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> with nothing
<lb/>better than family lectures?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q>It is for me,</q> said young <persName>Delvile</persName>, rising, <q>to beg
<lb/>pardon of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> for having occasioned them:
<lb/>but when she is so good as to honour us with her com
<lb/>pany again, I hope I shall have more discretion.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then left the room; and <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> also rising
<lb/>to go, said, <q>My dear, I commit you to very kind
<lb/>hands:  <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, I am sure, will be happy to hear
<lb/>your story; speak to her, therefore, without reserve.
<lb/>And pray don't imagine that I make you over to her
<lb/>from any slight; on the contrary, I admire and com
<lb/>mend your modesty very much; but my time is ex
<lb/>tremely precious, and I cannot devote so much of it to
<lb/>an explanation as your diffidence requires.</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then, to the great joy of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he retired:
<lb/>leaving her much in doubt whether his haughtiness or
<lb/>his condescension humbled her most.</p>
<p><lb/><q>These men,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, <q>can never com
<lb/>prehend the pain of a delicate female mind, upon en
<lb/>tering into explanations of this sort:  I understand it,
<lb/>however, too well to inflict it.  We will, therefore,
<lb/>have no explanations at all till we are better ac
<lb/>quainted; and then, if you will venture to favour me
<lb/>with any confidence, my best advice, and, should any
<lb/>be in my power, my best services shall be at your
<lb/>command.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>You do me, madam, much honour,</q> answered <persName>Ce
<lb/>cilia</persName>; <q>but I assure you, I have no explanation to
<lb/>give.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Well, well, at present,</q> returned <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb/><q>I am content to hear that answer, as I have acquired
<lb/>no right to any other:  but hereafter I shall hope for
<pb n="213"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">209</mw>
<lb/>more openness:  it is promised me by your countenance,
<lb/>and I mean to claim the promise by my friendship.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Your friendship will both honour and delight me,
<lb/>and whatever are your enquiries, I shall always be
<lb/>proud to answer them; but, indeed, with regard to this
<lb/>affair</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>My dear <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> interrupted <persName>Mrs. Del
<lb/>vile</persName>, with a look of arch incredulity, <q>men seldom
<lb/>risk their lives where an escape is without hope of
<lb/>recompense.  But we will not now say a word more
<lb/>upon the subject.  I hope you will often favour me
<lb/>with your company, and by the frequency of your vi
<lb/>sits, make us both forget the shortness of our acquain
<lb/>tance.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> finding her resistance only gave birth to
<lb/>fresh suspicion, now yielded, satisfied that a very little
<lb/>time must unavoidably clear up the truth.  But her
<lb/>visit was not therefore shortened, the sudden par
	  <lb/>tiality with which the figure and countenance of <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName> had impressed her, was quickly ripened into
<lb/>esteem by the charms of her conversation:  she found
<lb/>her sensible, well bred, and high spirited, gifted by
<lb/>nature with superior talents, and polished by educa
<lb/>tion and study with all the elegant embellishments of
<lb/>cultivation.  She saw in her, indeed, some portion of
<lb/>the pride she had been taught to expect; but it was
<lb/>so much softened by elegance, and so well tempered
<lb/>with kindness, that it elevated her character, without
<lb/>rendering her manners offensive.</p>
<p><lb/>With such a woman, subjects of discourse could
<lb/>never be wanting, nor fertility of powers to make them
<lb/>entertaining:  and so much was <persName>Cecilia</persName> delighted with
<lb/>her visit, that though her carriage was announced at

<lb/>twelve o'clock, she reluctantly concluded it at two;
<lb/>and in taking her leave, gladly accepted an invitation

<lb/>equally pleased with her young guest, promised before
<lb/>that time to return her visit.</p></div>

<p>
	  <lb/><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Cecilia</persName> found <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> eagerly waiting to hear
<lb/>some account how she had passed the morning, and
	  <lb/>fully persuaded that she would leave the <name>Delviles</name>
<lb/>with a determination never more, but by necessity, to
<lb/>see them:  she was, therefore, not only surprised, but
<lb/>disappointed, when instead of fulfilling her expecta
<lb/>tions, she assured her that she had been delighted
<lb/>with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, whose engaging qualities amply
<lb/>recompensed her for the arrogance of her husband;
<lb/>that her visit had no fault but that of being too short;
<lb/>and that she had already appointed an early day for
<lb/>repeating it.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was evidently hurt by this praise; and
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who perceived among all her guardians a
<lb/>powerful disposition to hatred and jealousy, soon
<lb/>dropt the subject:  though so much had she been
<lb/>charmed with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, that a scheme of removal
<pb n="215"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">211</mw>
<lb/>once more occured to her, notwithstanding her dislike
<lb/>of her stately guardian.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>At dinner, as usual, they were joined by <persName>Sir Ro
<lb/>bert Floyer</persName>, who grew more and more assiduous in
<lb/>his attendance, but, this day, contrary to his general
<lb/>custom of remaining with the gentlemen, made his
<lb/>exit before the ladies left the table; and as soon as he
<lb/>was gone, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> desired a private conference
<lb/>with <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/>They went together to the drawing-room, where,
	  <lb/>after a flourishing preface upon the merits of <persName>Sir Ro
<lb/>bert Floyer</persName>, he formerly acquainted her that he was
<lb/>commissioned by that gentleman, to make her a ten
<lb/>der of his hand and fortune.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had not much reason to be surprised at
<lb/>this overture, desired him to tell the baronet, she was
<lb/>obliged to him for the honour he intended her, at the
<lb/>same time she absolutely declined receiving it.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, laughing, told her this answer was very
<lb/>well for a beginning, though it would by no means
<lb/>serve beyond the first day of the declaration; but
<lb/>when <persName>Cecilia</persName> assured him she should firmly adhere to
<lb/>it, he remonstrated with equal surprise and discon
<lb/>tent upon the reasons of her refusal.  She thought it
	  <lb/>sufficient to tell him that <persName>Sir Robert</persName> did not please
<lb/>her; but, with much raillery, he denied the assertion
<lb/>credit, assuring her that he was universally admired
<lb/>by the ladies, that she could not possibly receive a
<lb/>more honourable offer, and that he was reckoned
<lb/>by every body the finest gentleman about the
<lb/>town.  His fortune, he added, was equally unexcep
<lb/>tionable with his figure and his rank in life; all the
<pb n="216"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">212</mw>
<lb/>world, he was certain, would approve the connection,
<lb/>and the settlement made upon her should be dictated
<lb/>by herself.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> begged him to be satisfied with an answer
<lb/>which she never could change, and to spare her the
<lb/>enumeration of particular objections, since Sir Ro
<lb/>bert was wholly and in every respect disagreeable
<lb/>to her.</p>
<p><lb/><q>What then,</q> cried he, <q>could make you so
<lb/>frightened for him at the opera-house?  There has
<lb/>been but one opinion about town ever since of your
<lb/>prepossession in his favour.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am extremely concerned to hear it; my fright
<lb/>was but the effect of surprise, and belonged not more
	    <lb/>to <persName>Sir Robert</persName> than to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He told her that nobody else thought the same;
<lb/>that her marriage with the baronet was universally re
<lb/>spected; and, in conclusion, notwithstnading her ear
<lb/>nest desire that he would instantly and explicitly in
	  <lb/>form <persName>Sir Robert</persName> of her determination, he repeatedly
<lb/>refused to give him any final answer, till she had
<lb/>taken more time for consideration.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was extremely displeased at this irksome
<lb/>importunity, and still mroe chagrined to find her in
<lb/>cautious emotion at the opera-house, had given rise to
<lb/>suspicions of her harbouring a partiality for a man
<lb/>whom every day she more heartily disliked.</p>
<p><lb/>While she was deliberating in what manner she
<lb/>could clear up this mistake, which after she was left
<lb/>alone occupied all her thoughts, she was interrupted
<lb/>by the entrance of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, whose joy in meet
<lb/>ing her at length by herself exceeded not her own;
<pb n="217"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">213</mw>
<lb/>for charmed as he was that he could now examine into
<lb/>the state of her affairs, she was not less delighted that
<lb/>she could make them known to him.</p>
<p><lb/>After mutual expressions, guarded, however, on the
<lb/>part of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, though unreserved on that of
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, of their satisfaction in being again able to
<lb/>converse as in former times, he asked if she would
<lb/>permit him, as the privilege of their long acquaintance,
<lb/>to speak to her with sincerity.</p>
<p><lb/>She assured him he could not more oblige her.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Let me, then,</q> said he, <q>enquire if yet that ar
<lb/>dent confidence in your own steadiness, which so
<lb/>much disdained my fears that the change of your resi
<lb/>dence might produce a change in your sentiments, is
	    <lb/>still as unshaken as when we parted in <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>?  or
<lb/>whether experience, that foe to unpractised refinement,
<lb/>has already taught you the fallibility of theory?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>When I assure you,</q> replied <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>
<lb/>enquiry gives me no pain, I think I have sufficiently
<lb/>answered it; for were I conscious of any alteration,
<lb/>it could not but embarrass and distress me.  Very
<lb/>far, however, from finding myself in the danger with
<lb/>which you threatened me, of <emph>forgetting Bury, its in
<lb/>habitants, and its environs</emph>, I think with pleasure of
	    <lb/>little else, since <placeName>London</placeName>, instead of bewitching, has
<lb/>greatly disappointed me.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>How so?</q> cried <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, much de
<lb/>lighted.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Not,</q> answered she, <q>in itself, not in its magni
<lb/>ficence, nor in its diversions, which seem to be inex
<lb/>haustible; but these, though copious as instruments
<lb/>of pleasure, are very shallow as sources of happiness:
<lb/>the disappointment, therefore, comes nearer home,
<pb n="218"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">214</mw>
	    <lb/>and springs not from <placeName>London</placeName>, but from my own situa
<lb/>tion.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Is that then disagreeable to you?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You shall yourself judge, when I have told you
<lb/>that from the time of my quitting your house till this
<lb/>very moment, when I have again the happiness of
<lb/>talking with you, I have never once had any conver
<lb/>sation, society, or intercourse, in which friendship or
<lb/>affection have had any share, or my mind has had the
<lb/>least interest.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She then entered into a detail of her way of life,
<lb/>told him how little suited to her taste was the un
	  <lb/>bounded dissipation of the <name>Harrels</name>, and feelingly ex
<lb/>patiated upon the disappointment she had received
<lb/>from the alteration in the manners and conduct of her
<lb/>young friend.  <q>In her,</q> she continued, <q>had I
<lb/>found the companion I came prepared to meet, the
<lb/>companion from whom I had so lately parted, and in
<lb/>whose society I expected to find consolation for the
	    <lb/>loss of yours and of <persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>, I should have
<lb/>complained of nothing; the very places that now tire,
<lb/>might then have entertained me; and all that passes
<lb/>for unmeaning dissipation, might have worn the ap
<lb/>pearance of variety and pleasure.  But where the
<lb/>mind is wholly without interest, every thing is languid
<lb/>and insipid; and accustomed as I have long been to
<lb/>think friendship the first of human blessings, and social
<lb/>converse the greatest of human enjoyments, however
<lb/>can I reconcile myself to a state of careless indiffer
<lb/>ence, to making acquaintance without any concern
<lb/>either for preserving or esteeming them, and to going
<lb/>on from day to day in an eager search of amusement,
	    <lb/>with no companion for the hours of retirement, a<sic corr=""></sic> nd<sic corr=""></sic>no

<lb/>view beyond that of passing the present moment in ap
<lb/>parent gaiety and thoughtlessness!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who heard these complaints with
<lb/>secret rapture, far from seeking to soften or remove,
<lb/>used his utmost endeavours to strengthen and en
<lb/>crease them, by artfully retracting her former way of
<lb/>life, and pointing out with added censures the change
<lb/>in it she had been lately compelled to make:  <q>a
<lb/>change,</q> he continued, <q>which, though ruinous of your
<lb/>time, and detrimental to your happiness, use will, I
<lb/>fear, familiarize, and familiarity render pleasant.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>These suspicions, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>mortify
<lb/>me greatly; and why, when far from finding me
<lb/>pleased, you hear nothing but repining, should you
<lb/>still continue to harbour them?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Because your trial has yet been too short to
<lb/>prove your firmness, and because there is nothing to
<lb/>which time cannot contentedly accustom us.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I feel not much fear,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>of stand
<lb/>ing such a test as might fully satisfy you; but never
<lb/>theless, not to be too presumptuous, I have by no
<lb/>means exposed myself to all the dangers which you
<lb/>think surround me, for of late I have spent almost
<lb/>every evening at home and by myself.</q></p>
<p><lb/>This intelligence was to <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> a surprise
<lb/>the most agreeable he could receive.  Her distaste
<lb/>for the amusements which were offered her, greatly
<lb/>relieved his fears of her forming any alarming connec
<lb/>tion; and the discovery that while so anxiously he
<lb/>had sought her every where in public, she had quietly
<lb/>passed her time by her own fire-side, not only re-as
<lb/>sured him for the present, but gave him information
<lb/>where he might meet with her in future.</p>

<lb/>He then talked of the duel, and solicitously led her
<lb/>to speak openly of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>:  and here, too,
<lb/>his satisfaction was entire; he found her dislike of
<lb/>him such as his knowledge of her disposition made
<lb/>him expect; and she wholly removed his suspicions
<lb/>concerning her anxiety about the quarrel, by explain
<lb/>ing to him her apprehensions of having occasioned it
<lb/>herself.</p>
<p><lb/>Neither did her confidence rest here; she acquainted
	  <lb/>him with the conversation she had just had with <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel</persName>, and begged his advice in what manner, she
<lb/>might secure herself from further importunity.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had now a new subject for his dis
<lb/>cernment.  Every thing had confirmed to him the pas
<lb/>sion which <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> had conceived for <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and
<lb/>he had therefore concluded the interest of the Harrels
<lb/>would be all in his favour:  other ideas now struck
	  <lb/>him; he found that <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was given up for <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert</persName>; and he determined carefully to watch the
<lb/>motions both of the Baronet and her young guardian,
<lb/>in order to discover the nature of their plans and con
<lb/>nection.  Mean time, convinced by her unaffected
<lb/>aversion to the proposals she had received, that she
<lb/>was at present in no danger from the league he sus
<lb/>pected, he merely advised her to persevere in mani
<lb/>festing a calm repugnance to their solicitations, which
<lb/>could not fail, before long, to dishearten them both.</p>
<p><lb/><q>But, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I now fear this man as
<lb/>much as I dislike him, for his late fierceness and bru
<lb/>tality, though they have encreased my disgust, make
<lb/><sic corr="">make</sic> me dread to shew it.  I am impatient, therefore,

<lb/>to have done with him, and to see him no more.  And
	    <lb/>for this purpose, I wish to quit the house of <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel</persName>, where he has access at his pleasure.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You can wish nothing more judiciously,</q> cried
<lb/>he; <q>would you, then, return into the country?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>That is not yet in my power; I am obliged to re
<lb/>side with one of my guardians.  To-day I have seen
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, and </q></p>
<p><lb/><q><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>?</q> interrupted <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, in a
<lb/>voice of astonishment, <q>surely you do not think of
<lb/>removing into that family?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What can I do so well?  <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> is a charm
<lb/>ing woman, and her conversation would afford me
<lb/>more entertainment and instruction in a single day,
<lb/>than under this roof I should obtain in a twelve
<lb/>month.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Are you serious?  Do you really think of making
<lb/>such a change?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I really wish it, but I know not yet if it is practi
	    <lb/>cable:  on <name>Thursday</name>, however, I am to dine with her,
<lb/>and then, if it is in my power, I will hint to her my
<lb/>desire.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>And can <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> possibly wish,</q> cried <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Monckton</persName>, with earnestness, <q>to reside in such a

<lb/>haughty, and self-sufficient of men?  Is not his wife
<lb/>the proudest of women?  And is not the whole family
<lb/>odious to all the world?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You amaze me!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>surely that can
<lb/>not be their general character?  <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, indeed,
<lb/>deserves all the censure he can meet for his wearisome

<lb/>spent this whole morning with her, and though I
<lb/>waited upon her with a strong prejudice in her disfa
<lb/>vour, I observed in her no pride that exceeded the
<lb/>bounds of propriety and native dignity.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Have you often been at the house?  Do you
<lb/>know the son too?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I have seen him three or four times.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And what do you think of him?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hardly know enough of him to judge fairly.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But what does he seem to you?  Do you not per
<lb/>ceive in him already all the arrogance, all the con
<lb/>temptuous insolence of his father?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O no! far from it indeed; his mind seems to be
<lb/>liberal and noble, open to impressions of merit, and
<lb/>eager to honour and promote it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You are much deceived:  you have been reading
<lb/>your own mind, and thought you had read his; I
<lb/>would advise you sedulously to avoid the whole fa
<lb/>mily; you will find all intercourse with them irksome
<lb/>and comfortless:  such as the father appears at once,
<lb/>the wife and the son will, in a few more meetings, ap
<lb/>pear also.  They are descended from the same flock,
<lb/>and inherit the same self-complacency.  <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>
<lb/>married his cousin, and each of them instigates the
<lb/>other to believe that all birth and rank would be at
<lb/>an end in the world, if their own superb family had
	    <lb/>not a promise of support from their hopeful <persName>Morti
<lb/>mer</persName>.  Should you precipately settle yourself in their

<lb/>by their united insolence.</q></p>

<lb/>discredit, that she was at length persuaded she had
<lb/>judged too hastily, and, after thanking him for his
<lb/>counsel, promised not to take any measures towards a
<lb/>removal without his advice.</p>
<p><lb/>This was all he desired; and now, enlivened by
<lb/>finding that his influence with her was unimpaired,
<lb/>and that her heart was yet her own, he ceased his ex
<lb/>hortations, and turned the discourse to subjects more
<lb/>gay and general, judiciously cautious neither by te
<lb/>dious admonitions to disgust, nor by fretful solicitude
<lb/>to alarm her.  He did not quit her till the evening
<lb/>was far advanced, and then, in returning to his own
<lb/>house, felt all his anxieties and disappointments re
<lb/>compensed by the comfort this long and satisfactory
<lb/>conversation had afforded him.  While <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>charmed with having spent the morning with her

        <p><lb/>After some general conversation, he asked her how

        <p><lb/><q>This morning,</q> she answered, <q>when I had the

            <lb/><q>What deception, Sir?  I don't at all understand
                <lb/>you.  How is his safety endangered?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Ah, madam!</q> said he smiling, <q>what danger
            <lb/>indeed is there that any man would not risk to give
            <lb/>birth to such solicitude!  <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, however, I

            <lb/>town, till his surgeon pronounces that he may travel
            <lb/>without any hazard.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>But is he, seriously, so mad as to intend leaving
            <lb/>town without the consent of his surgeon?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Nothing less than such an intention could have

                <lb/>of the offence upon the offended.  I feel, however, an

                <lb/>shall I sin quite beyond forgiveness if I venture to

            <lb/><q>No certainly,if you wish it, I can have no ob

        <p><lb/><q>I found him, then, surrounded by a set of gay
            <lb/>young men, who, by way of keeping up his spirits,
            <lb/>made him laugh and talk without ceasing:  he assured
            <lb/>me himself that he was perfectly well, and intended
            <lb/>to gallop out of town to morrow morning; though,
            <lb/>when I shook hands with him at parting, I was both
            <lb/>shocked and alarmed to feel, by the burning heat of

            <lb/>ought rather to call in a physician.</q></p>

        <p>	  <lb/>They were soon after summoned to dinner.  <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Delvile</persName>, to the infinite joy of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, was out.</p>
        <p><lb/>The day was spent greatly to her satisfaction.
            <lb/>There was no interruption from visitors, she was tor
            <lb/>mented by the discussion of no disagreeable subjects,
            <lb/>the duel was not mentioned, the antagonists were not
            <lb/>hinted at, she was teazed with no self-sufficient encou
            <lb/>ragement and wearied with no mortifying affability;
            <lb/>the conversation at once was lively and rational, and
            <lb/>though general, was rendered interesting, by a reci
            <lb/>procation of good-will and pleasure in the conversers.</p>
        <p><lb/>The favourable opinion she had conceived both of
            <lb/>the mother and the son this long visit served to con
            <lb/>firm:  in <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> she found strong sense, quick
            <lb/>parts, and high breeding; in <persName>Mortimer</persName>, sincerity and
            <lb/>vivacity joined with softness and elegance:  and in
            <pb n="228"/>

            <lb/>both there seemed the most liberal admiration of ta
            <lb/>lents, with an openness of heart that disdained all
            <lb/>disguise.  Greatly pleased with their manners, and
            <lb/>struck with all that was apparent in their characters,
            <lb/>she much regretted the prejudice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
            <lb/>which now, with the promise she had given him, was
            <lb/>all that opposed her making an immediate effort to
            <lb/>wards a change in her abode.</p>
        <p><lb/>She did not take her leave till eleven o'clock, when
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, after repeatedly thanking her for her
            <lb/>visit, said she would not so much encroach upon her
            <lb/>good-nature as to request another till she had waited
            <lb/>upon her in return; but added, that she meant very
            <lb/>speedily to pay that debt, in order to enable herself,
            <lb/>by friendly and frequent meetings, to enter upon the
            <lb/>confidential commission with which her guardian had
            <lb/>entrusted her.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was pleased with the delicacy which gave
            <lb/>rise to this forbearance, yet having in fact nothing
            <lb/>either to relate or conceal, she was rather sorry than
            <lb/>glad at the delay of an explanation, since she found
            <lb/>the whole family was in an error with respect to the
            <lb/>situation of her affairs.</p></div>

<lb/>in the drawing room:  and, while she was upon the
<lb/>stairs, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> ran out, calling eagerly, <q>Is that
<lb/>my brother?</q></p>
<p><lb/>Before she could make an answer, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, in
	  <lb/>the same impatient tone, exclaimed, <q>Is it <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Arnott</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q> No it is not,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>did you expect him so
<lb/>late?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Expect him?  Yes,</q>
answered <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q> I
<lb/>have expected him the whole evening, and cannot
<lb/>conceive what he has done with himself.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>'Tis abominably provoking,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/><q>that he should be out of the way just now when he
<lb/>is wanted.  However, I dare say to-morrow will do
<lb/>as well.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I don't know that,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>; <q>Reeves
<lb/>is such a wretch that I am sure he will give me all the
<lb/>trouble in his power.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Here <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> entered; and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> called
<lb/>out, <q>O brother we have been distressed for you
<lb/>cruelly; we have had a man here who has plagued
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> to death, and he wanted you sadly to
<lb/>speak to him.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I should have been very glad,</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb/><q>to have been of any use, and perhaps it is not yet
<lb/>too late; who is the man?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, carelessly, <q>only a fellow
<lb/>from that rascally taylor who has been so troublesome
<lb/>to me lately.  He has had the impudence, because I
<lb/>did not pay him the moment he was pleased to want
<lb/>his money, to put the bill into the hands of one Reeves,
<lb/>a griping attorney, who has been here this evening,
<lb/>and thought proper to talk to me pretty freely.  I can

<lb/>tell the gentleman I shall not easily forget his imper
<lb/>tinence! however I really wish mean time I could
<lb/>get rid of him.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>How much is the bill, Sir?</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Why it's rather a round sum; but I don't know
<lb/>how it is, one's bills mount up before one is aware:
<lb/>those fellows charge such confounded sums for tape
<lb/>and buckram; I hardly know what I have had of him,
<lb/>and yet he has run me up a bill of between three and
<lb/>four hundred pounds.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/>Here there was a general silence; till <persName>Mrs. Har
<lb/>rel</persName> said, <q>Brother, can't you be so good as to lend
<lb/>us the money?  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> says he can pay it again
<lb/>very soon.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O yes, very soon,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>for I shall
<lb/>receive a great deal of money in a little time; I only
<lb/>want to stop this fellow's mouth for the present.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Suppose I go and talk with him?</q> said <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Arnott</persName><sic corr="."></sic></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, he's a brute, a stock!</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>;
<lb/><q>nothing but the money will satisfy him:  he will hear
<lb/>no reason; one might as well talk to a stone.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> now looked extremely distressed; but
<lb/>upon his sister's warmly pressing him not to lose any
<lb/>time, he gently said, <q>If this person will but wait a
<lb/>week or two, I should be extremely glad, for really
<lb/>just now I cannot take up so much money without
<lb/>such particular loss and inconvenience, that I hardly
<lb/>know how to do it:but yet, if he will not be ap
<lb/>peased, he must certainly have it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Appease?</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>you might as
<lb/>well appease the sea in a storm! he is as hard as
<lb/>iron.</q></p>
<pb n="231"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">227</mw>
<p>
<lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, then forcing a smile, though evidently
<lb/>in much uneasiness, said he would not fail to raise the
<lb/>money the next morning, and was taking his leave,
<lb/>when <persName>Cecilia</persName>, shocked that such tenderness and good
<lb/>nature should be thus grossly imposed upon, hastily
<lb/>begged to speak with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and taking her into
<lb/>another room, said, <q>I beseech you, my dear friend,
<lb/>let not your worthy brother suffer by his generosity;
	    <lb/>permit me in the present exigence to assist <persName>Mr. Har
<lb/>rel</persName>:  my having such a sum advanced can be of no
<lb/>consequence; but I should grieve indeed that your
<lb/>brother, who so nobly understands the use of money,
<lb/>should take it up at any particular disadvantage.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You are vastly kind,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>and I
<lb/>will run and speak to them about it:  but which ever
<lb/>of you lends the money, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> has assured me
<lb/>he shall pay it very soon.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/>She then returned with the proposition.  <persName>Mr. Ar
<lb/>nott</persName> strongly opposed it, but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seemed ra
<lb/>ther to prefer it, yet spoke so confidently of his spee
<lb/>dy payment, that he appeared to think it a matter of
<lb/>little importance from which he accepted it.  A gene
<lb/>rous contest ensued between <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> and <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>but as she was very earnest, she at length prevailed,
<lb/>and settled to go herself the next morning into the
	  <lb/>city, in order to have the money advanced by <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Briggs</persName>, who had the management of her fortune en
<lb/>tirely to himself, her other guardians never interfer
<lb/>ing in the executive part of her affairs.</p>
<p><lb/>This arranged, they all retired.</p>
<p><lb/>And then, with encreasing astonishment, <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>reflected upon the ruinous levity of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and
<lb/>the blind security of his wife; she saw in their situa
<pb n="232"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">228</mw>
<lb/>tion danger the most alarming, and in the behaviour
<lb/>of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> selfishness the most inexcusable; such
<lb/>glaring injustice to his creditors, such utter insensi
<lb/>bility to his friends, took from her all wish of assisting
<lb/>him, though the indignant compassion with which
<lb/>she saw the easy generosity of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> so fre
<lb/>quently abused, had now, for his sake merely, induced
<lb/>her to relieve him.</p>
<p><lb/>She resolved, however, as soon as the present dif
<lb/>ficulty was surmounted, to make another attempt to
<lb/>open the eyes of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to the evils which so
<lb/>apparently threatened her, and press her to exert all
<lb/>her influence with her husband, by means both of ex
<lb/>ample and advice, to retrench his expences, before it
<lb/>hsould be absolutely too late to save him from
<lb/>ruin.</p>
<p><lb/>She determined also, at the same time that she ap
<lb/>plied for the money requisite for this debt, to take up
<lb/>enough for discharging her own bill at the booksellers,
	  <lb/>and putting in execution her plan of assisting the <name>Hills</name>.</p>
<p><lb/>The next morning she arose early, and attended by
<lb/>her servant, set out for the house of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, pur
<lb/>posing, as the weather was clear and frosty, to walk
	  <lb/>through <placeName>Oxford Road</placeName>, and then put herself into a
<lb/>chair; and hoping to return to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s by the
<lb/>ususal hour of breakfast.</p>
<p><lb/>She had not proceeded far, before she saw a mob
<lb/>gathering, and the windows of almost all the houses
<lb/>filling with spectators.  She desired her servant to
<lb/>enquire what this meant, and was informed that the
<lb/>people were assembling to see some malefactors pass
	  <lb/>by in their way to <placeName>Tyburn</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb/>Alarmed at this intelligence from the fear of meet
<pb n="233"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">229</mw>
<lb/>ing the unhappy criminals, she hastily turned down
<lb/>the next street, but found that also filling with people,
<lb/>who were running to the scene she was trying to
<lb/>avoid; encircled thus every way, she applied to a
<lb/>maid-servant who was standing at the door of a large
<lb/>house, and begged leave to step in till the mob was
<lb/>gone by.  The maid immediately consented, and she
<lb/>waited here while she sent her man for a chair.</p>
<p><lb/>He soon arrived with one; but just as she returned
<lb/>to the street-door, a gentleman, who was hastily en
<lb/>tering the house, standing back to let her pass, sud
<lb/>denly exclaimed, <q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>!</q> and looking at
<lb/>him, she perceived young <persName>Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q>I cannot stop an instant,</q> cried she, running
<lb/>down the steps, <q>lest the crowd should prevent the
<lb/>chair from going on.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Will you not first,</q> said he, handing her in, <q>tell
<lb/>me what news you have heard?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>News?</q> repeated she, <q>No, I have heard
<lb/>none!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You will only, then, laugh at me for those offi
<lb/>cious offers you did so well to reject?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I know not what offers you mean!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>They were indeed superfluous, and therefore I
<lb/>wonder not you have forgotten them.  Shall I tell the
<lb/>chairman whither to go?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>To <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>.  But I cannot imagine what
<lb/>you mean.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>!</q> repeated he, <q>O live for ever
<lb/>French beads and Bristol stones! fresh offers may
<lb/>perhaps be made there, impertinent, officious, and
<lb/>useless as mine!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then told her servant the direction, and, mak
<pb n="234"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">230</mw>
<lb/>ing his bow, went into the house she had just
<lb/>quitted.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely amazed by this short, but unin
<lb/>telligible conversation, would again have called upon
<lb/>him to explain his meaning, but found the crowd en
<lb/>creasing so fast, that she could not venture to detain
<lb/>the chair, which with difficulty made its way to the
<lb/>adjoining streets:  but her surprise at what had passed
<lb/>so entirely occupied her, that when she stopt at the
<lb/>house of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, she had almost forgotten what
<lb/>had brought her thither.</p>
<p><lb/>The foot-boy, who came to the door, told her that
<lb/>his master was at home, but not well.</p>
<p><lb/>She desired he might be acquainted that she wish
<lb/>ed to speak to him upon business, and would wait
<lb/>upon him again at any hour when he thought he
<lb/>should be able to see her.</p>
<p><lb/>The boy returned with an answer that she might
<lb/>call again the next week.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, knowing that so long a delay would destroy
<lb/>all the kindness of her intention, determined to write
<lb/>to him for the money, and therefore went into the
<lb/>parlour, and desired to have pen and ink.</p>
<p><lb/>The boy, after making her wait some time in a
<lb/>room without any fire, brought her a pen and a little
<lb/>ink in a broken tea-cup, saying, <q>Master begs you
<lb/>won't spirt it about, for he's got no more; and all
<lb/>our blacking's as good as gone.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Blacking!</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, Miss, when master's shoes are blacked, we
<lb/>commonly gets a little drap of fresh ink.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> promised to be careful, but desired him to
<lb/>fetch her a sheet of paper.</p>
<pb n="235"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">231</mw>
<p>
<lb/><q>Law, Miss,</q> cried the boy, with a grin, <q>I dare
<lb/>say master'd as soon give you a bit of his nose! hows
<lb/>ever I'll go ax.</q></p>
<p><lb/>In a few minutes he returned again, and brought
<lb/>in his hand a slate and a pencil; <q>Miss,</q> cried he,
<lb/><q>Master says how you may write upon this, for he
<lb/>supposes you have no great matters to say.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, much astonished at this extreme parsimony,
<lb/>was obliged to consent but as the point of the pencil
<lb/>was very blunt, desired the boy to get a knife, that
<lb/>she might cut it.  He obeyed, but said, <q>Pray, Miss,
<lb/>take care it ben't known, for master don't do such a
<lb/>thing once in a year, and if he know'd I'd got you the
<lb/>knife, he'd go nigh to give me a good polt of the head.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then wrote upon the slate her desire to be
<lb/>informed in what manner she should send him her re
<lb/>ceipt for six hundred pounds, which she begged to have
<lb/>instantly advanced.</p>
<p><lb/>The boy came back grinning, and holding up his
<lb/>hands, and said, <q>Miss, there's a fine piece of work
<lb/>up stairs!  Master's in a peck of troubles; but he
<lb/>says how he'll come down, if you'll stay till he's got
<lb/>his things on.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Does he keep his bed, then?  I hope I have not
<lb/>made him rise?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, Miss, he don't keep his bed, only he must get
<lb/>ready, for he wears no great matters of clothes when
<lb/>he is alone.  You are to know, Miss,</q> lowering his
<lb/>voice, <q>that that day as he went abroad with our
<lb/>sweep's cloaths on, he comed home in such a pickle
<lb/>you never see!  I believe somebody'd knock'd him in
	    <lb/>the kennel; so does <persName>Moll</persName>; but don't you say as I teld

	    <lb/>you!  He's been special bad ever since.  <persName>Moll</persName> and I
<lb/>was as glad as could be, because he's so plaguy sharp;
<lb/>for, to let you know, Miss, he's so near, its partly a
<lb/>wonder how he lives at all:  and yet he's worth a
<lb/>power of money too.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Well, well,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, not very desirous to
<lb/><sic corr="">to</sic> encourage his forwardness, <q>if I want any thing
<lb/>I'll call for you.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The boy, however, glad to tell his tale, went on.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Our <persName>Moll</persName> won't stay with him above a week
<lb/>longer, Miss, because she says how she can't get no
<lb/>thing to eat, but just some old stinking salt meat,
<lb/>that's stayed in the butcher's shop so long, it would
	    <lb/>make a horse sick to look at it.  But <persName>Moll's</persName> pretty
<lb/>nice; hoswever, Miss, to let you know, we don't get
<lb/>a good meal so often as once a quarter! why this last
<lb/>week we han't had nothing at all but some dry musty
<lb/>red herrings; so you may think, Miss, we're kept
<lb/>pretty sharp!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He was now interrupted by hearing <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>
<lb/>coming down the stairs, upon which, abruptly break
<lb/>ing off his complaints, he held up his finger to his
<lb/>nose in token of secrecy, and ran hastily into the
<lb/>kitchen.</p>
<p><lb/>The appearance of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> was by no means
<lb/>rendered more attractive by illness and negligence of
<lb/>dress.  He had on a flannel gown and night-cap; his
<lb/>black beard, of many days growth, was long and grim,
<lb/>and upon his nose and one of his cheeks was a large
<lb/>patch of brown paper, which, as he entered the room,
<lb/>he held on with both his hands.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> made many apologies for having disturbed
<lb/>him, and some civil enquiries concerning his health.</p>

<p><lb/><q>Ay, ay, plump in the kennel; could hardly get

<p><lb/>Then perceiving upon the table some dust from the

<p><lb/><q>Ay, ay,</q> cried he, <q>thought as much all the

<lb/>casion which would not admit of delay.</p>
<p><lb/>Her remonstrances, however, he wholly disregard
<lb/>ed, telling her that girls knew nothing of the value of
<lb/>money, and ought not to be trusted with it; that he
<lb/>would not hear of such extravagance, and was resolv
<lb/>ed not to advance her a penny.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was both provoked and confounded by a re

<lb/>fusal so unexpected; and as she thought herself
<lb/>bound in honour to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> not to make known
<lb/>the motive of her urgency, she was for some time to
<lb/>tally silenced:  till recollecting her account with the
<lb/>bookseller, she determined to rest her plea upon that,
<lb/>persuaded that he could not, at least, deny her money
<lb/>to pay her own bills.</p>
<p><lb/>He heard her, however, with the utmost contempt;
<lb/><q>Books?</q> he cried, <q>what do you want with books?
<lb/>do no good; all lost time; words get no cash.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She informed him his admonitions were now too
<lb/>late, as she had already received them, and must
<lb/>therefore necessarily pay for them.</p>
<p><lb/><q>No, no, cried he, </q>send <lb/><q>'take them back, that's best;
<lb/>keep no such rubbish, won't turn to account; do bet
<lb/>ter without 'em.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>That, Sir, will be impossible, for I have had them
<lb/>some time, and cannot expect the bookseller to take
<lb/>them again.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Must, must,</q> cried he, <q>can't help himself; glad
<lb/>to have 'em too.  Are but a minor, can't be made pay
<lb/>a farthing.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> with much indignation heard such fraud re
<lb/>commended, and told him she could by no means con
<lb/>sent to follow his advice.  But she soon found, to her
<lb/>utter amazement, that he steadily refused to give her
<lb/>any other, or to bestow the slightest attention upon her
<lb/>expostulations, sturdily saying that her uncle had left
<lb/>her a noble estate, and he would take care to see it
<lb/>put in proper hands, by getting her a good and care
<lb/>ful husband.</p>
<p><lb/><q>I have no intention, no wish, Sir,</q> cried she, <q>to
<lb/>break into the income or estate left me by my uncle;

<lb/>on the contrary, I hold them sacred, and think myself
<lb/>bound in conscience never to live beyond them:  but
<lb/>the ten thousand poounds bequeathed me by my father,
<lb/>I regard as more peculiarly my own property, and
<lb/>therefore I think myself at liberty to dispose of it as I
<lb/>please.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What,</q> cried he in a rage, <q>make it over to a
<lb/>scrubby bookseller! give it up for an old pot-hook? no,
<lb/>no, won't suffer it; shan't be, shan't be, I say!  If
	    <lb/>you want some books, go to <placeName>Moorfields</placeName>, pick up
<lb/>enough at an old stall; get 'em at two-pence a-piece;
<lb/>dear enough too<sic corr="."></sic></q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> for some time hoped he was merely indulg
<lb/>ing his strange and sordid humour, by an opposition
<lb/>that was only intended to teaze her; but she soon
<lb/>found herself extremely mistaken; he was immove
<lb/>able in obstinacy, as he was incorrigible in avarice;
<lb/>he neither troubled him self with enquiries nor reason
<lb/>ing, but was contented with refusing her as a child
<lb/>might be refused, by peremptorily telling her she did
<lb/>not know what she wanted, and therefore should not
<lb/>have what she asked.</p>
<p><lb/>And with this answer, after all that she could urge,
<lb/>she was compelled to leave the house, as he com
<lb/>plained that his brown paper plaister wanted fresh
<lb/>dipping in vinegar, and he could stay talking no
<lb/>longer.</p>
<p><lb/>The disgust with which this behaviour filled her,
<lb/>was doubled by the shame and concern of returning to
	  <lb/>the <name>Harrels</name> with her promise unperformed; she deli
<lb/>berated upon every method that occurred to her of still
<lb/>endeavouring to serve them, but could suggest nothing,
<lb/>except trying to prevail upon <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> to interfere

<lb/>in her favour.  She liked not, indeed, the office of so

        <p><lb/>He laughed at first without making any answer;

                <lb/>most strict, seem universally, in those affairs where
                <lb/>their affections are concerned, to think hypocrisy ne

            <lb/>some deviation from such rules? and have expected
            <lb/>more openness and candour in a young lady who has
            <lb/>given so noble a proof of the liberality of her mind
            <lb/>and understanding?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>You amaze me beyond measure!</q> cried she,
            <lb/><q>what rules, what candour, what liberality do you
                <lb/>mean?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Must I speak yet more plainly? and if I do, will
            <lb/>you bear to hear me?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Indeed I should be extremely glad if you would
            <lb/>give me leave to understand you.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>And may I tell you what has charmed me, as well
            <lb/>as what I have presumed to wonder at?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>You may tell me any thing if you will but be less

        <p><lb/><q>Forgive then the frankness you invite, and let me
            <lb/>acknowledge to you how greatly I honour the noble
            <lb/>ness of your conduct.  Surrounded as you are by the
            <lb/>opulent and the splendid, unshackled by dependence,
            <lb/>unrestrained by authority, blest by nature with all
            <lb/>that is attractive, by situation with all that is desira
            <lb/>ble,to slight the rich, and disregard the powerful,
            <lb/>for the purer pleasure of raising oppressed merit, and
            <lb/>giving to desert that wealth in which alone it seemed
            <lb/>deficienthow can a spirit so liberal be sufficiently
            <lb/>admired, or a choice of so much dignity be too highly
            <lb/>extolled?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>I find,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I must forbear any fur

            <lb/>stand.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Pardon me, then,</q> cried he, <q>if here, I return to
            <lb/>my first question; whence is it that a young lady,
            <lb/>who can think so nobly, and act so disinterestedly,
            <pb n="244"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2G4v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">240</mw>
            <lb/>should not be uniformly great, simple in truth, and
            <lb/>unaffected in sincerity?  Why should she be thus
            <lb/>guarded, where frankness would do her so much ho
            <lb/>nour?  Why blush in owning what all others may
            <lb/>blush in envying?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Indeed you perplex me intolerably;</q> cried Ce
            <lb/>cilia, with some vexation.  <q>Why, Sir, will you not
                <lb/>be more explicit?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>And why, madam,</q> returned he, with a laugh,
            <lb/><q>would you tempt me to be more impertinent?
                <lb/>have I not said strange things already?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Strange indeed,</q> cried she,<q>for not one of them
            <lb/>can I comprehend!</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Pardon, then,</q> cried he, <q>and forget them all!
            <lb/>I scarce know myself what urged me to say them, but
            <lb/>I began inadvertently, without intending to go on,
            <lb/>and I have proceeded involuntarily, without knowing
            <lb/>how to stop.  The fault, however, is ultimately your
            <lb/>own, for the sight of you creates an insurmountable
            <lb/>desire to converse with you, and your conversation a
            <lb/>propensity equally incorrigible to take some interest
            <lb/>in your welfare.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>He would then have changed the discourse, and Ce
            <lb/>cilia, ashamed of pressing him further, was for some
            <lb/>time silent; but when one of the servants came to in
            <lb/>form her that his master meant to wait upon her di
            <lb/>rectly, her unwillingness to leave the matter in sus
            <lb/>pense, induced her, somewhat abruptly, to say, <q>Per
                <lb/>haps, Sir, you are thinking of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q rend="post()">A happy conjecture!</q> cried he, <q>but so wild a
            <lb/>one, I cannot but marvel how it should occur to
            <lb/>you!</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Well, Sir,</q> said she, <q>I must acknowledge I
            <pb n="245"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2H1r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">241</mw>
            <lb/>now understand your meaning; but with respect to
            <lb/>what has given rise to it, I am as much a stranger as
            <lb/>ever.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>The entrance of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> here closed the con
            <lb/>versation.</p>
        <p><lb/>He began with his usual ostentatious apologies, de
            <lb/>claring he had so many people to attend, so many
            <lb/>complaints to hear, and so many grievances to redress,
            <lb/>that it was impossible for him to wait upon her sooner,
            <lb/>and not without difficulty that he waited upon her now.</p>
        <p><lb/>Mean time his son almost immediately retired:  and
            <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, instead of listening to this harangue, was
            <lb/>only disturbing herself with conjectures upon what
            <lb/>had just passed.  She saw that young <persName>Delvile</persName> con
            <lb/>cluded she was absolutely engaged to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
            <lb/>and though she was better pleased that any suspicion
            <lb/>should fall there than upon <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, she
            <lb/>was yet both provoked and concerned to be suspected
            <lb/>at all.  An attack so earnest from almost any other
            <lb/>person could hardly have failed being very offensive
            <lb/>to her, but in the manners of young <persName>Delvile</persName> good
            <lb/>breeding was so happily blended with frankness, that
            <lb/>his freedom seemed merely to result from the open
            <lb/>ness of his disposition, and even in its very act pleaded
            <lb/>its own excuse.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/>Her reverie was at length interrupted by <persName>Mr. Del
            <lb/>vile's</persName> desiring to know in what he could serve her.</p>
        <p><lb/>She told him she had present occasion for 600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. and
            <lb/>hoped he would not object to her taking up that sum.</p>
        <p><lb/><q>Six hundred pounds,</q> said he, after some deli
            <lb/>beration, <q>is rather an extraordinary demand for a
                <lb/>young lady in your situation; your allowance is con
                <lb/>siderable, you have yet no house, no equipage, no es

                <lb/>tablishment; your expences, I should imagine, can
                <lb/>not be very great</q></p>
        <p><lb/>He stopt, and seemed weighing her request.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, shocked at appearing extravagant, yet too
            <lb/>generous to mention <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, had again recourse
            <lb/>to her bookseller's bill, which she told him she was
            <lb/>anxious to discharge.</p>
        <p><lb/><q>A bookseller's bill?</q> cried he:  <q>and do you want
            <lb/>600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. for a bookseller's bill?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>No, Sir,</q> said she, stammering, <q>nonot all for
            <lb/>that,I have some otherI have a particular occa
            <lb/>sion</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>But what bill at all,</q> cried he, with much sur
            <lb/>prise, <q>can a young lady have with a bookseller?
                <lb/><title>The Spectator</title>, <title>Tatler</title>, and <title>Guardian</title>, would make
                <lb/>library sufficient for any female in the kingdom, nor
                <lb/>do I think it like a gentlewoman to have more.  Be
                <lb/>sides, if you ally yourself in such a manner as I shall
                <lb/>approve and recommend, you will, in all probability,
                <lb/>find already collected more books than there can
                <lb/>ever be any possible occasion for you to look into.  And
                <lb/>let me counsel you to remember, that a lady, whether
                <lb/>so called from birth or only from fortune, should never
                <lb/>degrade herself by being put on a level with writers,
                <lb/>and such sort of people.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for his advice, but confessed
            <lb/>that upon the present occasion it came too late, as the
            <lb/>books were now actually in her possession.</p>
        <p><lb/><q>and have you taken,</q> cried he, <q>such a measure
            <lb/>as this without consulting me?  I thought I had as
            <lb/>sured you my opinion was always at your service
            <lb/>when you were in any dilemma.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Yes, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>but I knew how

            <lb/>much you were occupied, and wished to avoid taking
            <lb/>up your time.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>I cannot blame your modesty,</q> he replied, <q>and
            <lb/>therefore, as you have contracted the debt, you are,
            <lb/>in honour, bound to pay it.  <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, however,
            <lb/>has the entire management of your fortune, my many
            <lb/>avocations obliging me to decline so laborious a trust;
            <lb/>apply, therefore, to him, and, as things are situated, I
            <lb/>will make no opposition to your demand.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>I have already, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>spoke to Mr.

        <p>	  <lb/><q>You went to him first, then?</q> interrupted <persName>Mr.

        <p><lb/><q>I was unwilling, Sir, to trouble you till I found
            <lb/>it unavoidable.</q>  She then acquainted him with <persName>Mr.

            <lb/>favour to intercede in her behalf, that the money
            <lb/>might no longer be denied her.</p>
        <p><lb/>Every word she spoke, his pride seemed rising to
            <lb/>resent, and when she had done, after regarding her
            <lb/>some time with apparent indignation, he said, <q><emph>I</emph> inter

        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, amazed to find him thus violently irritated,
            <lb/>made a very earnest apology for her request; but,
            <lb/>without paying her any att<sic corr="">t</sic>ention, he walked up and
            <lb/>down the room, exclaiming, <q>an agent! and to <persName>Mr.
                <lb/>Briggs</persName>!This is an affront I could never have ex
                <lb/>pected! why did I degrade myself by accepting this
                <lb/>humiliating office!  I ought to have known better!</q>
            <lb/>Then, turning to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>Child,</q> he added, <q>for
                <lb/>whom is it you take me, and for what?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> again, though affronted in her turn, began
            <lb/>some protestations of respect; but haughtily inter

            <lb/>rupting her, he said, <q>If of me, and of my rank in life,
                <lb/>you judge by <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> or by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, I may be
                <lb/>subject to proposals such as these every day; suffer
                <lb/>me, therefore, for your better information, to hint to
                <lb/>you, that the head of an ancient and honourable
                <lb/>house, is apt to think himself somewhat superior to
                <lb/>people just rising from the dust of obscurity.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>Thunderstruck by this imperious reproof, she could
            <lb/>attempt no further vindication; but when he observed
            <lb/>her consternation, he was somewhat appeased, and
            <lb/>hoping he had now impressed her with a proper sense
            <lb/>of his dignity, he more gently said, <q>You did not, I
                <lb/>believe, intend to insult me.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Good Heaven, Sir; no!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>no
            <lb/>thing was more distant from my thoughts; if my ex
            <lb/>pressions have been faulty, it has been wholly from
            <lb/>ignorance.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Well, well, we will think then no more of it.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>She then said she would no longer detain him, and
            <lb/>without daring again to mention her petition, she
            <lb/>wished him good morning.</p>
        <p><lb/>He suffered her to go, yet as she left the room, gra
            <lb/>ciously said, <q>Think no more of my displeasure, for
                <lb/>it is over:  I see you were not aware of the extraordi
                <lb/>nary thing you proposed.  I am sorry I cannot pos
                <lb/>sibly assist you; on any other occasion you may de
                <lb/>pend upon my services:  but you know <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>,
                <lb/>you have seen him yourselfjudge, then, how a man
                <lb/>of any fashion, is to accommodate himself with such a
                <lb/>person!</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> concurred, and courtseying, took her leave.</p>
        <p><lb/><q>Ah! thought she, in her way home, how happy is
            <lb/>it for me that I followed the advice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>!

<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> with the utmost impatience; she told them
<lb/>with much concern the failure of her embassy, which
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> heard with visible resentment and discon
<lb/>tent, while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, entreating him not to think
<lb/>of it, again made an offer of his services, and declared
<lb/>he would disregard all personal inconvenience for the
<lb/>pleasure of making him and his sister easy.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was much mortified that she had not the
<lb/>power to act the same part, and asked <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb/>whether he believed his own influence with <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>
<lb/>would be more successful.</p>
<p><lb/><q>No, no,</q> answered he, <q>the old curmudgeion
<lb/>would but the rather refuse.  I know his reason, and
<lb/>therefore am sure all pleas will be vain.  He has deal
<lb/>ings in the alley, and I dare say games with your

<lb/>protest I hardly know why nothowever, 'tis as well
<lb/>let alone.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> insisted upon hearing what he meant, and,
<lb/>after some hesitation, he hinted that there were
<lb/>means, by which, with very little inconvenience, she
<lb/>might borrow the money.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, with that horror natural to all unpractised
<lb/>minds at the first idea of contracting a voluntary
<lb/>debt, started at this suggestion, and seemed very ill
<lb/>disposed to listen to it.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, perceiving her
<lb/>repugnance, turned to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, nad said, <q>Well,
<lb/>my good brother, I hardly know how to suffer you to
<lb/>sell out at such a loss, but yet, my present necessity
<lb/>is so urgent</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Don't mention it,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>; <q>I am
<lb/>very sorry I let you know it; be certain however, that
<lb/>while I have any thing it is your's and my sister's.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The two gentlemen were then retiring together;
<lb/>but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, shocked for <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, though unmoved
<lb/>by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, stopt them to enquire what was the
<lb/>way by which it was meant she could borrow the
<lb/>money?</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seemed averse to answer, but she would
	  <lb/>not be refused; and then he mentioned a <name>Jew</name>, of
<lb/>whose honesty he had made undoubted trial, nad who,
<lb/>as she was so near being of age, would accept very
<lb/>trifling interest for whatever she should like to take
<lb/>up.</p>
<p><lb/>The heart of <persName>Cecilia</persName> recoiled at the very mention of
<lb/>a <name rend="slant(italic)">Jew</name>, and <emph>taking up money upon interest;</emph> but,
<lb/>im
<lb/>pelled strongly by her own generosity to emulate that
<lb/>of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, she agreed, after some hesitation, to
<lb/>have recourse to this method.</p>

<p>
	  <lb/><persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Harrel</persName> then made some faint denials, and <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Arnott</persName> protested he had a thousand times rather sell out
<lb/>at any discount, than consent to her taking such a mea
<lb/>sure; but, when her first reluctance was conquered, all
<lb/>that he urged served but to shew his worthiness in a
<lb/>stronger light, and only encreased her desire of saving
<lb/>him from repeated imposition.</p>
<p><lb/>Her total ignorance in what manner to transact
<lb/>this business, made her next put it wholly into the
<lb/>hands of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, whom she begged to take up
<lb/>600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. upon such terms as he thought equitable, and to
<lb/>which, whatever they might be, she would sign her
<lb/>name.</p>
<p><lb/>He seemed somewhat surprised at the sum, but with
<lb/>out any question or objection undertook the commis
<lb/>sion; and <persName>Cecilia</persName> would not lessen it, because unwil
<lb/>ling to do more for the security of the luxurious Mr.
<lb/>Harrel, than for the distresses of the laborious Hills.</p>
<p><lb/>Nothing could be more speedy than the execution
<lb/>of this affair, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was diligent and expert, the
<lb/>whole was settled that morning, and, giving to the
	  <lb/><name>Jew</name> her bond for the payment of the interest he re
<lb/>quired, she put into the hands of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> 350<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>.
<lb/>for which he gave his receipt, and she kept the rest
<lb/>for her own purposes.</p>
<p><lb/>She intended the morning after this transaction to
<lb/>settle her account with the bookseller.  When she
<lb/>went into the parlour to breakfast, she was somewhat
<lb/>surprised to see <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seated there, in earnest
<lb/>discourse with his wife.  Fearful of interrupting a
<lb/>tete a tete so uncommon, she would have retired; but
<lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, calling after her, said, <q>O pray come in!
	    <lb/>I am only telling <persName>Priscilla</persName> a piece of my usual ill
<pb n="252"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2H4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">248</mw>
<lb/>luck.  You must know I happen to be in immediate
<lb/>want of 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. though only for three or four days, and
	    <lb/>I sent to order honest old <persName>Aaron</persName> to come hither di
<lb/>rectly with the money; but it so happens that he
<lb/>went out of town the moment he had done with us
<lb/>yesterday, and will not be back again this week.
	    <lb/>Now I don't believe there is another <name>Jew</name> in the
<lb/>kingdom who will let me have money upon the same
<lb/>terms:  they are such notorious rascals, that I hate
<lb/>the very thought of employing.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who could not but understand what this
<lb/>meant, was too much displeased both by his extrava
<lb/>gance and his indelicacy, to feel at all inclined to
<lb/>change the destination of the money she had just re
<lb/>ceived; and therefore coolly agreed that it was un
<lb/>fortunate, but added nothing more.</p>
<p><lb/><q>O, it is provoking indeed,</q> cried he,
<q>for the ex
<lb/>tra-interest I must pay one of those extortioners is
<lb/>absolutely so much money thrown away.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, still without noticing these hints, began her
<lb/>breakfast.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> then said he would take his
<lb/>tea with them; and, while he was buttering some
<lb/>dry toast, exclaimed, as if from sudden recollection,
<lb/><q>O Lord, now I think of it, I believe, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,
<lb/>you can lend me this money yourself for a day or two.
<lb/>The moment old Aaron comes to town, I will pay
<lb/>you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose generosity, however extensive, was
<lb/>neither thoughtless nor indiscriminate, found some
<lb/>thing so repulsive in this gross procedure, that instead
<lb/>of assenting to his request with her usual alacrity, she
<lb/>answered very gravely, that the money she had just
<lb/>received was already appropriated to a particular
<pb n="253"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">249</mw>
<lb/>purpose, and she knew not how to defer making use
<lb/>of it.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was extremely chagrined by this reply,
<lb/>which was by no means what he expected; but, toss
<lb/>ing down a dish of tea, he began humming an air,
<lb/>and soon recovered his usual unconcern.</p>
<p><lb/>In a few minutes, ringing his bell, he desired a
	  <lb/>servant to go to <persName>Mr. Zackery</persName>, and inform him that he
<lb/>wanted to speak with him immediately.</p>
<p><lb/><q>And now,</q> said he, with a look in which vexation
<lb/>seemed struggling with carelessness, <q>the thing is
<lb/>done!  I don't like, indeed, to get into such hands,
<lb/>for 'tis hard ever to get out of them, when once one
<lb/>begins,and hitherto I have kept pretty clear.  But
<lb/>there is no help for it<persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> cannot just now
<lb/>assist meand so the thing must take its course.
	    <lb/><persName>Priscilla</persName>, why do you look so grave?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am thinking how unlucky it is my brother
<lb/>should happen to be unable to lend you this money.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, don't think about it; I shall get rid of the
<lb/>man very soon, I dare say; I shall pay off in a very
<lb/>few days,I hope so, at leastI am sure I mean it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> now grew a little disturbed; she looked at
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who seemed also uneasy, and then, with
<lb/>some hesitation, said, <q>Have you really never, Sir,
<lb/>employed this man before?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>Never in my life:  never any but old <persName>Aaron</persName>.  I
<lb/>dread the whole race; I have a sort of superstitious
<lb/>notion that if once I get into their clutches, I shall
<lb/>never be my own man again; and that induced me to
<lb/>beg your assistance.  However, 'tis no great matter.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She then began to waver; she feared there might
<lb/>be future mischief as well as present inconvenience,

<lb/>in his applying to new usurers, and knowing she had
<lb/>now the power to prevent him, thought herself half
<lb/>cruel in refusing to exert it.  She wished to consult
<lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, but found it necessary to take her
<lb/>measures immediately, as the Jew was already sent
<lb/>for, and must in a few moments be either employed or
<lb/>discarded.</p>
<p><lb/>Much perplext how to act, between a desire of
<lb/>doing good, and a fear of encouraging evil, she
<lb/>weighed each side hastiy, but while still uncertain
	  <lb/>which ought to preponderate, her kindness for <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Harrel</persName> interfered, and, in the hope of rescuing her
<lb/>husband from further bad practices, she said she
<lb/>would postpone her own business for the few days he
<lb/>mentioned, rather than see him compelled to open
<lb/>any new account with so dangerous a set of men.</p>
<p><lb/>He thanked her in his usual negligent manner, and
<lb/>accepting the 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. gave her his receipt for it, and a
<lb/>promise she should be paid in a week.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, however, seemed more grateful, and
<lb/>with many embraces spoke her sense of this friendly
<lb/>good-nature.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, happy from believing that she
<lb/>had revived in her some spark of sensibility, deter
<lb/>mined to avail herself of so favourable a symptom,
<lb/>and enter at once upon the disagreeable task she had
<lb/>set herself, of representing to her the danger of her
<lb/>present situation.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>As soon, therefore, as breakfast was done, and <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Arnott</persName>, who came in before it was over, was gone,
<lb/>with a view to excite her attention by raising her cu
<lb/>riosity, she begged the favour of a private conference
<lb/>in her own room, upon matters of some importance.</p>
<p><lb/>She began with hoping that the friendship in which
<pb n="255"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">251</mw>
<lb/>they had so long lived would make her pardon the
<lb/>liberty she was going to take, and which nothing less
<lb/>than their former intimacy, joined to strong appre
<lb/>hensions for her future welfare, could authorise:
	  <lb/><q>But, oh <persName>Priscilla</persName>!</q> she continued, <q>with open eyes
<lb/>to see your danger, yet not warn you of it, would be
<lb/>a reserve treacherous in a friend, and cruel even in a
<lb/>fellow-creature.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What danger?</q>cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, much alarmed,
<lb/><q>do you think me ill? do I look consumptive?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Yes, consumptive indeed!</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>but not,
<lb/>I hope, in your constitution.</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then, with all the tenderness in her power, she
<lb/>came to the point, and conjured her without delay to
<lb/>retrench her expences, and change her thoughtless
<lb/>way of life for one more considerate and domestic.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, with much simplicity, assured her <emph>she
<lb/>did nothing but what every body else did</emph>, and that it
<lb/>was quite impossible for her to <emph>appear in the world</emph>
<lb/>in any other manner.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>But how are you to appear hereafter?</q> cried <persName>Ce
<lb/>cilia</persName>, <q>if now you live beyond your income, you must
<lb/>consider that, in time, your income by such depreda
<lb/>tions will be exhausted.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But I declare to you,</q> answered <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/><q>I never run in debt for more than half a year, for as
<lb/>soon as I receive my own money, I generally pay it
<lb/>away every shilling:  and so borrow what I want till
<lb/>pay-day comes round again.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And that,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>seems a method ex
<lb/>pressly devised for keeping you eternally comfortless:
<lb/>pardon me, however, for speaking so openly, but I
<lb/>fear <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> himself must be even still less atten

<lb/>tive and accurate in his affairs, or he could not so fre
<lb/>quently be embarrassed.  And what is to be the re
	    <lb/>sult? look but, my dear <persName>Priscilla</persName>, a little forward,
<lb/>and you will tremble at the prospect before you!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> seemed frightened at this speech, and
<lb/>begged to know what she would have them do?</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then, with equal wisdom and friendliness,
<lb/>proposed a general reform in the household, the public
<lb/>and private expences of both:  she advised that a
<lb/>strict examination might be made into the state of
<lb/>their affairs, that all their bills should be called in,
<lb/>and faithfully paid, and that an entire new plan of life
<lb/>should be adopted, according to the situation of their
<lb/>fortune and income when cleared of all incumbrances.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Lord, my dear!</q> exclaimed <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, with a
<lb/>look of astonishment, <q>why <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> would no
<lb/>more do all this than fly!  If I was only to make such
<lb/>a proposal, I dare say he would laugh in my face.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And why?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why?why because it would seem such an odd
<lb/>thingit's what nobody thinks ofthough I am sure
<lb/>I am very much obliged to you for mentioning it.
<lb/>Shall we go down stairs?  I think I heard somebody
<lb/>come in.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No matter who comes in,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>reflect
<lb/>for a moment upon my proposal, and, at least, if you
<lb/>disapprove it, suggest something more eligible.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O, it's a very good proposal, that I agree,</q> said
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, looking very weary, <q>but only the thing
<lb/>is, it's quite impossible.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why so? why is it impossible?</q></p>

<lb/><q>But what is your reason?  What makes you sure
<lb/>of it?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Lord, I can't tellbut I know it isbecauseI
<lb/>am very certain it is.</q></p>
<p><lb/>Argument such as this, though extremely fatiguing
<lb/>to the understanding of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, had yet no power to
<lb/><emph>blunt her purpose;</emph> she warmly expostulated against
<lb/>the weakness of her defence, strongly represented the
<lb/>imprudence of her conduct, and exhorted her by every
<lb/>tie of justice, honour and discretion to set about a re
<lb/>formation.</p>
<p><lb/><q>Why what can I do?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, impa
<lb/>tiently, <q>one must live a little like other people.
<lb/>You would not have me be stared at, I suppose; and
<lb/>I am sure I don't know what I do that every body
<lb/>else does not do too.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But were it not better,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with more
<lb/>energy, <q>to think less of <emph>other people</emph> and more of
<lb/><emph>yourself?</emph> to consult your own fortune, and your own
<lb/>situation in life, instead of being blindly guided by
<lb/>those of <emph>other people?</emph> If, indeed, <emph>other people</emph> would
<lb/>be responsible for your losses, for the dimunition of
<lb/>your wealth, and for the disorder of your affairs, then
<lb/>might you rationally make their way of life the exam
<lb/>ple of yours:  but you cannot flatter yourself such will
<lb/>be the case; you know better; your losses, your di
<lb/>minished fortune, your embarrassed circumstances will
<lb/>be all your own! pitied, perhaps, by some, but blamed
<lb/>by more, and assisted by none!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Good Lord, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>!</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb/>starting, <q>you talk just as if we were ruined!</q></p>

<lb/>fain, by pointing out your danger, prevail with you to
<lb/>prevent in time so dreadful catastrophe.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, more affronted than alarmed, heard
<lb/>this answer with much displeasure, and after a sullen
<lb/>hesitation, peevishly said, <q>I must own I don't take
<lb/>it very kind of you to say such frightful things to me:
<lb/>I am sure we only live like the rest of the world, and
<lb/>I don't see why a man of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s fortune should
<lb/>live any worse.  As to his having now and then a
<lb/>little debt or two, it is nothing but what every body
<lb/>else has.  You only think it so odd, because you
<lb/>a'n't used to it:  but you are quite mistaken if you
<lb/>suppose he does not mean to pay, for he told me this
<lb/>morning, that as soon as ever he receives his rents, he
<lb/>intends to discharge every bill he has in the world.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am very glad to hear it,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>and
<lb/>I heartily wish he may have the resolution to adhere
<lb/>to his purpose.  I feared you would think me imper
<lb/>tinent, but you do worse in believing me unkind;
<lb/>friendship and good-will could alone have induced me
<lb/>to hazard what I have said to you.  I must, however,
<lb/>have done; though I cannot forbear adding that I
<lb/>hope what has already passed will sometimes recur
<lb/>to you.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They then separated; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> half angry at
<lb/>remonstrances she thought only censorious, and Ce
<lb/>cilia at her pettishness, and folly, though grieved at
<lb/>her blindness.</p>
<p><lb/>She was soon, however, recompensed for this vexa
<lb/>tion, by a visit from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, who, finding her
<lb/>alone, sat with her some time, and by her spirit, un
<lb/>derstanding and elegance, dissipated all her chagrin.</p>
<pb n="259"/>

<p>
<lb/>From another circumstance, also, she received
	  <lb/>much pleasure, though a little perplexity; <persName>Mr. Ar
<lb/>nott</persName> brought her word that <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, almost
<lb/>quite well, had actually left his lodgings, and was
<lb/>gone into the country.</p>
<p><lb/>She now half suspected that the account of his ill
	  <lb/>ness given her by young <persName>De<sic corr="l"></sic>vile</persName>, was merely the effect
<lb/>of his curiosity to discover her sentiments of him; yet
<lb/>when she considered how foreign to his character ap
<lb/>peared every species of artifice, she exculpated him
<lb/>from the design, and concluded that the impatient
	  <lb/>spirit of <persName>Belfield</persName> had hurried him away, when really
<lb/>unfit for travelling.  She had no means, however, to
<lb/>hear more of him now he had quitted the town, and
<lb/>therefore, though uneasy, she was compelled to be
<lb/>patient.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>In the evening she had again a visit from <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Monckton</persName>, who, though he was now acquainted how
<lb/>much she was at home, had the forbearance to avoid
<lb/>making frequent use of that knowledge, that his
<lb/>attendance might escape observation.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, as usual, spoke to him of all her affairs
<lb/>with the utmost openness; and as her mind was now
<lb/>chiefly occupied by her apprehensions for the Harrels,
<lb/>she communicated to him the extravagance of which
<lb/>they were guilty, and hinted at the distress that from
<lb/>time to time it occasioned; but the assistance she had
<lb/>afforded them her own delicacy prevented her men
<lb/>tioning.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> scrupled not from this account in
<lb/>stantly to pronounce Harrel a <emph>ruined man</emph>, and
<lb/>thinking <persName>Cecilia</persName>, from her connection with him, in
<lb/>much danger of being involved in his future difficul
<pb n="260"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">256</mw>
<lb/>ties, he most earnestly exhorted her to suffer no in
<lb/>ducement to prevail with her to advance him any
<lb/>money, confidently affirming she would have little
<lb/>chance of being ever repaid.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> listened to this charge with much alarm,
<lb/>but readily promised future circumspection.  She
<lb/>confessed to him the conference she had in the morn
<lb/>ing with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and after lamenting her de
<lb/>termined neglect of her affairs, she added, <q>I cannot
<lb/>but own that my esteem for her, even more than
<lb/>my affection, has lessened almost every day since I
<lb/>have been in her house; but this morning, when I
<lb/>ventured to speak to her with earnestness, I found
<lb/>her powers of reasoning so weak, and her infatua
<lb/>tion to luxury and expence so strong, that I have
<lb/>ever since felt ashamed of my own want of discern
<lb/>ment, in having formerly selected her for my friend.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q>When you gave her that title,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monck
<lb/>ton</persName>, <q>you had little choice in your power; her
<lb/>sweetness and good nature attracted you; childhood
<lb/>is never troubled with foresight, and youth is seldom
<lb/>difficult; she was lively and pleasing, you were
<lb/>generous and affectionate; your acquaintance with
<lb/>her was formed while you were yet too young to
<lb/>know your own worth; your fondness of her grew
<lb/>from habit; and before the inferiority of her parts
<lb/>had weakened your regard, by offending your judg
<lb/>ment, her early marriage separated you from her
<lb/>entirely.  But now you meet again, the scene is
<lb/>altered; three years of absence spent in the cultiva
<lb/>tion of an understanding naturally of the first order,
<lb/>by encreasing your wisdom, has made you more fasti
<lb/>dious; while the same time spent by her in mere
<pb n="261"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2K1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">257</mw>
<lb/>idleness and shew, has hurt her disposition, without
<lb/>adding to her knowledge, and robbed her of her
<lb/>natural excellencies, without enriching her with
<lb/>acquired ones.  You see her now with impartiality,
<lb/>for you see her almost as a stranger, and all those
<lb/>deficiencies which retirement and inexperience had
<lb/>formerly concealed, her vanity, and her superficial
<lb/>acquaintance with the world have now rendered
<lb/>glaring.  But folly weakens all bands; remember,
<lb/>therefore if you would form a solid friendship, to
<lb/>consult not only the heart, but the head; not only
<lb/>the temper, but the understanding.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q rend="pre()post()">Well, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>at least it must
<lb/>be confessed I have judiciously chosen <emph>you!</emph></q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You have, indeed, done me the highest honour,</q>
<lb/>he answered.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>Then they talked of <persName>Belfield</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>
<lb/>confirmed the account of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, that he had
<lb/>left <placeName>London</placeName> in good health.  After which, he en

<p><lb/><q>Yes,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> called upon
<lb/>me this morning.  She is a delightful woman; I am
<lb/>sorry you know her not enough to do her justice.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Is she civil to you?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Civil? she is all kindness!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Then depend upon it she has something in view:
<lb/>whenever that is not the case, she is all insolence.
	    <lb/>And <persName>Mr. De<sic corr="l"></sic>vile</persName>pray what do you think of
<lb/>him?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q rend="pre()post()">O, I think him insufferable! and I cannot suffi

<lb/><q>Well, and do you not now begin also to see the
<lb/>son properly</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Properly?  I don't understand you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Why as the very son of such parents, haughty
<lb/>and impertinent.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, indeed; he has not the smallest resem
<lb/>blance of his father, and if he resembles his mother,
<lb/>it is only what every one must wish who impartially
<lb/>sees her.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You know not the family.  But how, indeed,
<lb/>should you, when they are in a combination to pre
<lb/>vent your getting that knowledge?  They have all
<lb/>their designs upon you, and if you are not carefully
<lb/>upon your guard, you will be the dupe to them.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>What can you possibly mean?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Nothing but what every body else must imme
<lb/>diately see; they have a great share of pride, and
<lb/>a small one of wealth; you seem by fortune to be
<lb/>flung in their way, and doubtless they mean not to
<lb/>neglect so inviting an opportunity of repairing their
<lb/>estates.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Indeed you are mistaken; I am certain they
<lb/>have no such intention:  on the contrary, they all
<lb/>even teasingly persist in thinking me already en
<lb/>gaged elsewhere.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She then gave a history of their several suspicions.
<lb/><q>The impertinence of report,</q> she added, <q>has so
<lb/>much convinced them that <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> and
<lb/><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> fought merely as rivals, that I can only
<lb/>clear myself of partiality for one of them, to have it
<lb/>instantly concluded I feel it for the other.  And, far

<p><lb/><q>Tricks, nothing but tricks to discover your real

<p><lb/>He then gave her some general cautions to be upon

            <lb/>began to grow very impatient, but not knowing
            <lb/>what course to pursue, and wanting courage to re
            <lb/>mind <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> of his promise, she still waited
            <lb/>the performance of it without speaking.</p>
        <p><lb/>At this time, preparations were making in the
            <lb/>family to remove to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>, to spend the Easter
            <lb/>holidays:  but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was too much grieved at
            <lb/>such perpetual encrease of unnecessary expenses to
            <lb/>have any enjoyment in new prospects of entertain
            <lb/>ment, had at present some business of her own which
            <lb/>gave her full employment.</p>
        <p><lb/>The poor carpenter, whose family she had taken
            <lb/>under her protection, was just dead, and, as soon
            <lb/>as the last duties had been paid him, she sent for his
            <lb/>widow, and after trying to console her for the loss
            <lb/>she had suffered, assured her she was immediately
            <lb/>ready to fulfil the engagement into which she had
            <lb/>entered, of assisting her to undertake some better
            <lb/>method of procuring a livelihood:  and therefore de
            <lb/>sired to know in what manner she could serve her,
            <lb/>and what she thought herself able to do.</p>
        <p><lb/>The good woman, pouring forth thanks and
            <lb/>praises innumerable, answered that she had a cousin
            <lb/>who had offered, for a certain premium, to take her
            <lb/>into partnership in a small haberdasher's shop.
            <lb/><q>But then, madam,</q> continued she, <q>its quite
                <lb/>morally impossible I should raise such a sum, or else,
                <lb/>to be sure, such a shop as that, now I am grown so
                <lb/>poorly, would be quite a heaven upon earth to me:
                <lb/>for my strength, madam, is almost all gone away,

                <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">261</mw>
                <lb/>and when I do any hard work, it's quite a piteous
                <lb/>sight to see me, for I am all in a tremble after it,
                <lb/>just as if I had an ague, and yet all the time my
                <lb/>hands, madam, will be burning like a coal.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>You have indeed been overworked,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
            <lb/><q>and it is high time your feeble frame should have
                <lb/>some rest.  What is the sum your cousin demands?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>O madam, more than I shall be able to get to
            <lb/>gether in all my life! for earn what I will, it goes as
            <lb/>fast as it comes, because there's many mouths and
            <lb/>small pay, and two of the little ones that can't help
            <lb/>at all;and there's no Billy, madam, to work for
            <lb/>us now!</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>But tell me, what is the sum?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Sixty pound, madam.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>You shall have it!</q> cried the generous <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
            <lb/><q>if the situation will make you happy, I will give
                <lb/>it you myself.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>The poor woman wept her thanks, and was long
            <lb/>before she could sufficiently compose herself to
            <lb/>answer the further questions of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who next
            <lb/>enquired what could be done with the children?
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, however, hitherto hopeless of such a
            <lb/>provision for herself, had for them formed no plan.
            <lb/>She told her, therefore, to go to her cousin, and
            <lb/>consult upon this subject, as well as to make prepa<sic corr="ra"></sic>
            <lb/>tions for her own removal.</p>
        <p><lb/>The arrangement of this business now became her
            <lb/>favourite occupation.  She went herself to the shop,
            <lb/>which was a very small one in the Fetter-lane, and spoke
            <lb/>with <persName>Mrs. Roberts</persName>, the cousin; who agreed to take
            <lb/>the eldest girl, now sixteen years of age, by way of
            <lb/>helper; but she said she had room for no other:
            <pb n="266"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2K3v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">262</mw>
            <lb/>however, upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s offering to raise the premium,
            <lb/>she consented that the two children should also live
            <lb/>in the house, where they might be under the care of
            <lb/>their mother and sister.</p>
        <p><lb/>There were still two others to be disposed of; but
            <lb/>as no immediate method of providing for them
            <lb/>occurred to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, she determined for the present,
            <lb/>to place them in some cheap school, where they
            <lb/>might be taught plain work, which could not but
            <lb/>prove a useful qualification for whatever sort of
            <lb/>business they might hereafter attempt.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/>Her plan was to bestow upon <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> and her
            <lb/>children 100<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. by way of putting them all into a de
            <lb/>cent way of living; and then, from time to time, to
            <lb/>make them such small presents as their future exi
            <lb/>gencies, or changes of situation might require.</p>
        <p><lb/>Now, therefore, payment from <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> became
            <lb/>immediately necessary, for she had only 50<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. of the
            <lb/>600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. she had taken up in her own possession, and
            <lb/>her customary allowance was already so appropriated
            <lb/>that she could make from it no considerable deduction.</p>
        <p><lb/>There is something in the sight of laborious indi
            <lb/>gence so affecting and so respectable, that it renders
            <lb/>dissipation peculiarly contemptible, and doubles the
            <lb/>odium of extravagance; every time <persName>Cecilia</persName> saw this
            <lb/>poor family, her aversion to the conduct and princi
            <lb/>ples of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> encreased, while her delicacy of
            <lb/>shocking or shaming him diminished, and she soon
            <lb/>acquired for them, what she had failed to acquire
            <lb/>for herself, the spirit and resolution to claim her
            <lb/>debt.</p>
        <p><lb/>One morning, therefore, as he was quitting the
            <lb/>breakfast room, she hastily arose, and following,
            <pb n="267"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2K4r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">263</mw>
            <lb/>begged to have a moment's discourse with him.
            <lb/>They went together to the library, and after some
            <lb/>apologies, and much hesitation, she fancied he had
            <lb/>forgotten the 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. which she had lent him.</p>
        <p><lb/><q>The 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>.</q> cried he; <q>O, aye, true!I pro
            <lb/>test it had escaped me.  Well, but you don't want
            <lb/>it immediately?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>Indeed I do, if you can conveniently spare it.</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>O yes, certainly!without the least doubt!
            <lb/>Though now I think of itit's extremely unlucky,
            <lb/>but really just at this timewhy did not you put me
            <lb/>in mind of it before?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>I hoped you would have remembered it yourself?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><q>I could have paid you two days ago extremely
            <lb/>well;however, you shall certainly have it very
            <lb/>soon, that you may depend upon, and a day or two
            <lb/>can make no difference to you.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>He then wished her a good morning, and left her.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, very much provoked, regretted that she
            <lb/>had ever lent it at all, and determined for the future
            <lb/>strictly to follow the advice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> in
            <lb/>trusting him no more.</p>
        <p><lb/>Two or three days passed on, but still no notice
            <lb/>was taken either of the payment or the debt.  She
            <lb/>then resolved to renew her application, and be more
            <lb/>serious and more urgent with him; but she found, to
            <lb/>her utter surprise, this was not in her power, and
            <lb/>that though she lived under the same roof with him,
            <lb/>she had no opportunity to enforce her claim.  <persName>Mr.
                <lb/>Harrel</persName>, whenever she desired to speak with him,
            <lb/>protested he was so much hurried, he had not a
            <lb/>moment to spare; and even when, tired of his ex
            <lb/>cuses, she pursued him out of the room, he only
            <pb n="268"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2K4v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">264</mw>
            <lb/>quickened his speed, smiling, however, and bowing,
            <lb/>and calling out <q>I am vastly sorry, but I am so
                <lb/>late now I cannot stop an instant; however, as soon
                <lb/>as I come back, I shall be wholly at your command.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>When he came back, however, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>,
            <lb/>or some other gentleman was sure to be with him,
            <lb/>and the difficulties of obtaining an audience were
            <lb/>sure to be encreased.  And by this method, which he
            <lb/>constantly practised, of avoiding any private conver
            <lb/>sation, he frustrated all her schemes of remonstrating
            <lb/>upon his delay, since her resentment, however great,
            <lb/>could never urge her to the indelicacy of dunning
            <lb/>him in presence of a third person.</p>
        <p><lb/>She was now much perplexed how to put into exe
            <lb/>cution her plan for the <name>Hills</name>:  she knew it would be
            <lb/>in vain to apply for money to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.  Her
            <lb/>word, however, had been given, and her word she
            <lb/>held sacred:  she resolved, therefore, for the present,
            <lb/>to bestow upon them the 50<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. she still retained, and,
            <lb/>if the rest should be necessary before she became of
            <lb/>age, to spare it, however inconveniently, from her
            <lb/>private allowance, which, by the will of her uncle,
            <lb/>was 500<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. a year, 250<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. of which
            <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> received
            <lb/>for her board and accommodations.</p>
        <p><lb/>Having settled this matter in her own mind, she
            <lb/>went to the lodging of <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, in order to conclude
            <lb/>the affair.  She found her and all the children,
            <lb/>except the youngest, hard at work, and their honest
            <lb/>industry so much strengthened her compassion, that
            <lb/>her wishes for serving them grew every instant more
            <lb/>liberal.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> readily undertook to make her cousin
            <lb/>accept the premium for the present, which would

            <lb/>suffice to fix her, with three of her children, in the
            <lb/>shop:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> then went with her to Fetter-lane,
            <lb/>and there drawing up herself an agreement for their
            <lb/>entering into partnership, she made each of them
            <lb/>sign it and take a copy, and kept a third in her own
            <lb/>possession:  after which she gave a promissory note to
            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Roberts</persName> for the rest of the money.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/>She presented <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, also, with 10<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. to clothe
            <lb/>them all decently, and enable her to send two of
            <lb/>the children to school:  and assured her that she would
            <lb/>herself pay for their board and instruction, till she
            <lb/>should be established in her business, and have power
            <lb/>to save money for that purpose.</p>
        <p><lb/>She then put herself into a chair to return home,
            <lb/>followed by the prayers and blessings of the whole

<lb/>to a disposition fraught with tenderness and benevo
<lb/>lence, could give purer self-applause, or more exqui
<lb/>site satisfaction?</p>
<p><lb/>Such were the pleasures which regaled the reflec
<lb/>tions of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, when, in her way home, having got
<lb/>out of her chair to walk through the upper part of
	  <lb/><placeName>Oxford Street</placeName>, she was suddenly met by the old
<lb/>gentleman whose emphatical addresses to her had so
<lb/>much excited her astonishment.</p>
<p><lb/>He was passing quick on, but stopping the moment
<lb/>he perceived her, he sternly called out, <q>are you
<lb/>proud? are you callous? are you hard of heart so
<lb/>soon?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Put me, if you please, to some trial!</q> cried
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, with the virtuous courage of a self acquitting
<lb/>conscience.</p>
<p><lb/><q>I already have!</q> returned he, indignantly, <q>and
<lb/>already I have found you faulty!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am sorry to hear it,</q> said the amazed <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb/><q>but at least I hope you will tell me in what?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You refused me admittance,</q> he answered, <q>yet
<lb/>I was your friend, yet I was willing to prolong the
<lb/>term of your genuine tranquility!  I pointed out to
<lb/>you a method of preserving peace with your own
<lb/>soul; I came to you in behalf of the poor, and
<pb n="271"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">267</mw>
<lb/>instructed you how to merit their prayers; you heard
<lb/>me, you were susceptible, you complied!  I meant
<lb/>to have repeated the lesson, to have turned your
<lb/>whole heart to compassion, and to have taught you
<lb/>the sad duties of sympathising humanity.  For this
<lb/>purpose I called again, but again I was not admitted!
<lb/>Short was the period of my absence, yet long enough
<lb/>for the completion of your downfall!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Good heaven,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>how dreadful is
<lb/>this language! when have you called, Sir?  I never
<lb/>heard you had been at the house.  Far from refusing
<lb/>you admittance, I wished to see you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Indeed?</q> cried he, with some softness, <q>and
<lb/>are you, in truth, not proud? not callous? not hard
<lb/>of heart?  Follow me, then, and visit the humble
<lb/>and the poor, follow me, and give comfort to the
<lb/>fallen and dejected!</q></p>
<p><lb/>At this invitation, however desirous to do good,
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> started; the strangeness of the inviter, his
<lb/>flightiness, his authoritative manner, and the un
<lb/>certainty whither or to whom he might carry her,
<lb/>made her fearful of proceeding; yet a benevolent
<lb/>curiosity to see as well as serve the objects of his
<lb/>recom<sic corr="m"></sic>endation, joined to the eagerness of youthful
<lb/>integrity to clear her own character from the asper
<lb/>sion of hard-heartedness, soon conquered her resolu
<lb/>tion, and making a sign to her servant to keep near
<lb/>her, she followed as her conductor led her.</p>
<p><lb/>He went on silently and solemnly till he came to
	  <lb/><placeName>Swallow-street</placeName>, then turning into it, he stopt at a
<lb/>small and mean looking house, knocked at the door,
<lb/>and without asking any question of the man who
<pb n="272"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">268</mw>
<lb/>opened it, beckoned her to come after him, and
<lb/>hastened up some narrow winding stairs.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> again hesitated; but when she recollected
<lb/>that this old man, though little known, was frequently
<lb/>seen, and though with few people acquainted, was
<lb/>by many personally recognized, she thought it im
<lb/>possible he could mean her any injury.  She ordered
<lb/>her servant, however, to come in, and bid him keep
<lb/>walking up and down stairs till she returned to him.
<lb/>And then she obeyed the directions of her guide.</p>
<p><lb/>He proceeded till he came to the second floor, then
<lb/>again beckoning her to follow him, he opened a door,
<lb/>and entered a small and a very meanly furnished
<lb/>apartment.</p>
<p><lb/>And here, to her infinite astonishment, she per
<lb/>ceived, employed in washing some china, a very
<lb/>lovely young woman, genteelly dressed, and appear
<lb/>ing hardly seventeen years of age.</p>
<p><lb/>The moment they came in, with evident marks of
<lb/>confusion, she instantly gave over her work, hastily
<lb/>putting the basin, she was washing upon the table,
<lb/>and endeavouring to hide the towel with which she
<lb/>was wiping it, behind the chair.</p>
<p><lb/>The old gentleman advancing to her with quickness,
<lb/>said, <q>How is he now? is he better? will he live?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Heaven forbid he should not!</q> answered the
<lb/>young woman with emotion, <q>but indeed he is no
<lb/>better!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Look here,</q> said he pointing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I have
<lb/>brought you one who has power to serve you, and to
<lb/>relieve your distress:  one who is rolling in affluence,
<lb/>a stranger to ill, a novice in the world;unskilled in
<lb/>the miseries she is yet to endure, uncon<sic corr="s"></sic>cious of the
<pb n="273"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">269</mw>
<lb/>depravity into which she is to sink!Receive her
<lb/>benefaction while she is yet untainted, satisfied that
<lb/>while she aids you, she is blessing herself!</q></p>
<p><lb/>The young woman, blushing and abashed, said,
<lb/><q>You are very good to me, Sir, but there is no occa
<lb/>sionthere is no needI have not any necessityI
<lb/>am far from being so very much in want.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="OM9">Poor simple soul!</q> interrupted the old man,
<lb/><q id="OM10">and art thou ashamed of poverty?  Guard, guard
<lb/>thyself from other shames, and the wealthiest may
<lb/>envy thee!  Tell here thy story, plainly, roundly,
<lb/>truly:  abate nothing of thy indigence, repress nothing
<lb/>of her liberality.  The poor, not impoverished by
<lb/>their own guilt, are equals of the affluent, not enriched
<lb/>by their own virtue.  Come, then, and let me present
<lb/>ye to each other! young as ye both are, with many
<lb/>years and many sorrows to encounter, lighten the bur
<lb/>then of each other's cares, by the heart-soothing ex
<lb/>change of gratitude for beneficence!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He then took a hand of each, and joining them be
<lb/>tween his own, <q rend="slant(italic)">You,</q> he continued, <q>who though
<lb/>rich, are not hardened, and <emph>you</emph>, who though poor, are
<lb/>not debased, why should ye not love, why should ye
<lb/>not cherish each other?  The afflictions of life are te
<lb/>dious, its joys are evanescent; ye are now both young,
<lb/>and with little to enjoy, will find much to suffer.  Ye
<lb/>are both too, I believe, innocentOh could ye always
<lb/>remain so!Cherubs were ye then, and the sons of
<lb/>men might worship you!</q></p>
<p><lb/>He stopt, checked by his own rising emotion; but
<lb/>soon resuming his usual austerity, <q>Such, however,</q>
<lb/>he continued, <q>is the condition of humanity; in
<lb/>pity, therefore, to the evils impending over both, be
<pb n="274"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">270</mw>
<lb/>kind to each other!  I leave you together, and to
<lb/>your mutual tenderness I recommend you!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Then turning particularly to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>Disdain
<lb/>not,</q> he said, <q>to console the depressed; look upon
<lb/>her without scorn, converse with her, without con
<lb/>tempt:  like you, she is an orphan, though not, like
<lb/>you, an heiress;like her you are fatherless, though
<lb/>not like her friendless!  If <emph>she</emph> is awaited by the temp
<lb/>tations of adversity, <emph>you</emph>, also, are surrounded by the
<lb/>corruptions of prosperity.  Your fall is most probable,
<lb/>her's most excusable;commis<sic corr="">s</sic>erate <emph>her</emph> therefore
<lb/>now,by and by she may commiserate <emph>you?</emph></q></p>
<p><lb/>And with these words he left the room.</p>
<p><lb/>A total silence for some time succeeded his depar
<lb/>ture:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> found it difficult to recover from the
<lb/>surprise into which she had been thrown sufficiently
<lb/>for speech; in following her extraordinary director,
<lb/>her imagination had painted to her a scene such as
<lb/>she had so lately quitted, and prepared her to behold
<lb/>some family in distress, some helpless creature in sick
<lb/>ness, or some children in want; but of these to see
<lb/>none, to meet but one person, and that one fair,
<lb/>young, and delicate,an introduction so singular to
<lb/>an object so unthought of, deprived her of all power
<lb/>but that of shewing her amazement.</p>
<p><lb/>Mean while the young woman looked scarcely less
<lb/>surprised, and infinitely more embarrassed.  She
<lb/>surveyed her apartment with vexation, and her guest
<lb/>with confusion; she had listened to the exhortation
<lb/>of the old man with visible uneasiness, and now he
<lb/>was gone, seemed overwhelmed with shame and
<lb/>chagrin.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who in observing these emotions felt both
<pb n="275"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">271</mw>
<lb/>her curiosity and her compassion increase, pressed her
<lb/>hand as she parted with it, and, when a little reco
<lb/>vered, said, <q>You must think this a strange intrusion;
<lb/>but the gentleman who brought me hither is perhaps
<lb/>so well known to you, as to make his singularities
<lb/>plead with you their own apology.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, indeed, madam,</q> she answered bashfully,
<lb/><q>he is very little known to me; but he is very good,
<lb/>and very desirous to do me service:not but what I
<lb/>believe he thinks me much worse off than I really am,
<lb/>for, I assure you, madam, whatever he has said, I am
<lb/>not ill off at allhardly.</q></p>
<p><lb/>The various doubts to her disadvantage which had
<lb/>at first, from her uncommon situation, arisen in the
<lb/>mind of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, this anxiety to disguise, not display
<lb/>her distress, considerably removed, since it cleared
<lb/>her of all suspicion of seeking by artifice and imposi
<lb/>tion to play upon her feelings.</p>
<p><lb/>With a gentleness, therefore, the most soothing,
<lb/>she replied, <q>I should by no means have broken in
<lb/>upon you thus unexpectedly, if I had not concluded
<lb/>my conductor had some right to bring me.  However,
<lb/>since we are actually met, let us remember his injunc
<lb/>tions, and endeavour not to part, till, by a mutual
<lb/>exchange of good-will, each has added a friend to the
<lb/>other.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You are condescending indeed, madam,</q> answered
<lb/>the young woman, with an air the most humble,
<lb/><q>looking as you look, to talk of a friend when you
<lb/>come to such a place as this! up two pair of stairs!
<lb/>no furniture! no servant! every thing in such dis
	    <lb/>order!indeed I wonder at <persName>Mr. Albany</persName>! he should

<lb/>public, and does not care what he tells, nor who hears
<lb/>him;he knows not the pain he gives, nor the mis
<lb/>chief he may do.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am very much concerned,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, more
<lb/>and more surprised at all she heard, <q>to find I have
<lb/>been thus instrumental to distressing you.  I was ig
<lb/>norant whither I was coming, and followed him, be
<lb/>lieve me, neither from curiosity nor inclination, but
<lb/>simply because I knew not how to refuse him.  He is
<lb/>gone, however, and I will therefore relieve you by
<lb/>going too:  but permit me to leave behind me a small
<lb/>testimony that the intention of my coming was not
<lb/>mere impertinence.</q></p>
<p><lb/>She then took out her purse; but the young woman,
<lb/>starting back with a look of resentful mortification,
<lb/>exclaimed, <q>No, madam! you are quite mistaken;
	    <lb/>pray put up your purse; I am no beggar!  <persName>Mr. Al
<lb/>bany</persName> has misrepresented me, if he has told you I am.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, mortified in her turn at this unexpected re
<lb/>jection of an offer she had thought herself invited to
<lb/>make, stood some moments silent; and then said, <q>I
<lb/>am far from meaning to offend you, and I sincerely
<lb/>beg your pardon if I have misunderstood the charge
<lb/>just now given to me.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q rend="pre()post()">I have nothing to pardon, madam,</q> said she more
	  <lb/>calmly, <q>except, indeed, to <persName>Mr. Albany</persName>; and to him,
<lb/>'tis of no use to be angry, for he minds not what I say;
<lb/>he is very good, but he is very strange, for he thinks
<lb/>the whole world made to live in common, and that
<lb/>every one who is poor should ask, and every one who
<lb/>is rich should give:  he does not know that there are
<lb/>many who would rather starve.</q></p>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">273</mw>
<p>
<lb/><q> And you,</q>said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, half-smiling, <q>
<lb/>are of that number?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, indeed, madam!  I have not so much great
<lb/>ness of mind.  But those to whom I belong have more
<lb/>fortitude and higher spirit.  I wish I could imitate
<lb/>them!</q></p>
<p><lb/>Struck with the candour and simplicity of this
<lb/>speech, <persName>Cecilia</persName> now felt a warm desire to serve her,
<lb/>and taking her hand, said, <q>Forgive me; but though
<lb/>I see you wish me gone, I know not how to leave you:
<lb/>recollect, therefore, the charge that has been given to
<lb/>us both, and if you refuse my assistance one way,
<lb/>point out to me in what other I may offer it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>You are very kind, madam,</q> she answered, <q>and
<lb/>I dare say you are very good; I am sure you look so,
<lb/>at least.  But I want nothing; I do very well, and I
	    <lb/>have hopes of doing better.  <persName>Mr. Albany</persName> is too impa
<lb/>tient.  He knows, indeed, that I am not extremely
<lb/>rich, but he is much to blame if he supposes me there
<lb/>fore an object of charity, and thinks me so mean as to
<lb/>receive money from a stranger.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I am truly sorry,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>for the error I
<lb/>have committed, but you must suffer me to make my
<lb/>peace with you before we part; yet, till I am better
<lb/>known to you, I am fearful of proposing terms.  Per
<lb/>haps you will permit me to leave you my direction,
<lb/>and do me the favour to call upon me yourself?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O no, madam!  I have a sick relation whom I can
<lb/>not leave:  and indeed, if he were well, he would not
<lb/>like to have me make an acquaintance while I am in
<lb/>this place.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hope you are not his only nurse?  I am sure

<lb/>you do not look able to bear such fatigue.  Has he a
<lb/>physician?  Is he properly attended?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, Madam; he has no physician, and no attend
<lb/>ance at all!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And is it possible that in such a situation you can
<lb/>refuse to be assisted?  Surely you should accept
<lb/>some help for him, if not for yourself.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But what will that signify, when, if I do, he will
<lb/>not make use of it? and when he had a thousand
<lb/>and a thousand times rather die, than let any one know
<lb/>he is in want?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Take it, then, unknown to him; serve him without
<lb/>acquainting him you serve him.  Surely you would
<lb/>not suffer him to perish without aid?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Heaven forbid!  But what can I do?  I am under
<lb/>his command, madam, not he under mine?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Is he your father?Pardon my question, but
<lb/>your youth seems much to want a protector.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, madam, I have no father!  I was happier
<lb/>when I had!  He is my brother.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And what is his illness?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>A fever.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>A fever, and without a physician?  Are you sure,

<p><lb/><q>O yes, too sure!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Too sure? how so?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Because I know too well the occasion of it!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And what is the occasion?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, again
<lb/>taking her hand, <q>pray trust me; indeed you shall

<lb/><q>Ah madam!</q> said the young woman, sighing,
<lb/><q>you ought to be good, I am sure, for you will draw
<lb/>all out of me by such kindness as this! the occasion
<lb/>was a neglected wound, never properly healed.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>A wound? is he in the army?</q></p>

<p><lb/><q>O that I must not tell you! his name is a great

<lb/>know, Poverty!he would not run up a bill he could
<lb/>not pay.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Good heaven!but what can be done for him?
<lb/>he must not be suffered to linger thus; we must con
<lb/>trive some method of relieving and assisting him, whe
<lb/>ther he will consent or not.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I fear that will not be possible.  One of his friends
<lb/>has already found him out, and has written him the
<lb/>kindest letter!  but he would not answer it, and would
<lb/>not see him, and was only fretted and angry.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Well,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I will not keep you longer,
<lb/>lest he should be alarmed by your absence.  To-mor
<lb/>row morning, with your leave, I will call upon you
<lb/>again, and then I hope you will permit me to make
<lb/>some effort to assist you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>If it only depended upon me, madam,</q> she an
<lb/>swered, <q>now I have the honour to know who you
<lb/>are, I believe I should not make such scruple; for I
<lb/>was not brought up to notions so high as my brother.
<lb/>Ah! happy had it been for him, for me, for all his
<lb/>family, if he had not had them neither!</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then repeated expressions of comfort and
<lb/>kindness, and took her leave.</p>
<p><lb/>This little adventrue gave her infinite concern; all
<lb/>the horror which the duel had originally occasioned
<lb/>her, again returned; she accued herself with much
<pb n="281"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">277</mw>
<lb/>bitterness for having brought it on; and finding that
<lb/><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> was so cruelly a sufferer both in his
<lb/>health and his affairs, she thought it incumbent upon
<lb/>her to relieve him to the utmost of her ability.</p>
<p><lb/>Her sister, too, had extremely interested her; her
<lb/>youth, and the uncommon artlessness of her conversa
<lb/>tion, added to her melancholy situation, and the love
<lb/>liness of her person, excited in her a desire to serve,
<lb/>and an inclination to love her; and she determined,
<lb/>if she found her as deserving as she seemed engaging,
<lb/>not only to assist her at present, but, if her distresses
<lb/>continued, to receive her into her own house in
<lb/>future.</p>
<p><lb/>Again she regretted the undue detension of her 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>.
<lb/>What she now had to spare was extremely inadequate
<lb/>to what she now wished to bestow, and she looked
<lb/>forward to the conclusion of her minority with en
<lb/>creasing eagerness.  The generous and elegant plan
<lb/>of life she then intended to pursue, daily gained
<lb/>ground in her imagination, and credit in her opinion.</p></div>

<milestone unit="sig" n="2M3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">278</mw>
	  <lb/>quired for <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, and was told to go up stairs:
<lb/>but what was her amazement to meet, just coming out
<lb/>of the room into which she was entering, young Del
<lb/>vile!</p>
<p><lb/>They both started, and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, from the seeming
<lb/>strangeness of her situation, felt a confusion with
	  <lb/>which she had hitherto been unacquainted.  But <persName>Del
<lb/>vile</persName>, presently recovering from his surprise, said to
	  <lb/>her, with an expressive smile, <q>How good is <persName>Miss
<lb/>Beverley</persName> thus to visit the sick! and how much better
<lb/>might I have had the pleasure of seeing <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<lb/>had I but, by prescience, known her design, and de
<lb/>ferred my own enquiries till he had been revived by
<lb/>her's!</q></p>
<p><lb/>And then bowing, and wishing her good morning, he
<lb/>glided past her.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, notwithstanding the openness and purity of
<lb/>her intentions, was so much disconcerted by this un
<lb/>expected meeting, and pointed speech, that she had
<lb/>not the presence of mind to call him back and clear
<lb/>herself; and the various interrogatories and railleries
<lb/>which had already passed between them upon the
<lb/>subject of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, made her suppose that what
<lb/>he had formerly suspected he would now think con
<lb/>firmed, and conclude that all her assertions of indif
<lb/>ference, proceeded merely from that readiness at hy
<lb/>pocrisy upon particular subjects, of which he had
<lb/>openly accused her whole Sex.</p>
<p><lb/>This circumstance and this apprehension took from
<lb/>her for a while all interest in the errand upon which
<lb/>she came; but the benevolence of her heart soon
<lb/>brought it back, when, upon going into the room, she
<lb/>saw her new favourite in tears.</p>
<pb n="283"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">279</mw>
<p>
<lb/><q>What is the matter!</q> cried she, tenderly; <q>no
<lb/>new affliction I hope has happened?  Your brother is
<lb/>not worse?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No, madam, he is much the same; I was not cry
<lb/>ing for him.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>For what then? tell me, acquaint me with your
<lb/>sorrows, and assure yourself you tell them to a friend.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I was crying, madam, to find so much goodness
<lb/>in the world, when I thought there was so little! to
<lb/>find I have some chance of being again happy, when I
<lb/>thought I was miserable for ever!  Two whole years
<lb/>have I spent in nothing but unhappiness, and I
<lb/>thought there was nothing else to be had; but yester
<lb/>day, madam, brought me <emph>you</emph>, with every promise of
<lb/>nobleness and protection; and to-day a friend of my
<lb/>brother's has behaved so generously, that even my bro
<lb/>ther has listened to him, and almost consented to be
<lb/>obliged to him!</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And have you already known so much sorrow,</q>
<lb/>said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that this little dawn of prosperity
<lb/>should wholly overpower your spirits?  Gentle, amia
<lb/>ble girl! may the future recompense you for the past,
	    <lb/>and may <persName>Mr. Albany's</persName> kind wishes be fulfilled in the
<lb/>reciprocation of our comfort and affliction.</q></p>
<p><lb/>They then entered into a conversation which the
	  <lb/>sweetness of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and the gratitude of <persName>Miss Bel
<lb/>field</persName>, soon rendered interesting, friendly and unre
<lb/>served:  and in a very short time, whatever was essen
<lb/>tial in the story or situation of the latter was fully
<lb/>communicated.  She gave, however, a charge the
<lb/>most earnest, that her brother should never be ac
<lb/>quainted with the confidence she had made.</p>
<p><lb/>Her father who had been dead only two years, was
<pb n="284"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">280</mw>
<lb/>a linen-draper in the city; he had six daughters, of
<lb/>whom herself was the youngest, and only one son.
<lb/>This son, <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, was alike the darling of his
<lb/>father, mother, and sisters:  he was brought up at
<lb/>Eaton, no expence was spared in his education, no
<lb/>thing was denied that could make him happy.  With
<lb/>an excellent understanding he had uncommon quick
<lb/>ness of parts, and his progress in his studies were
<lb/>rapid and honourable:  his father, though he always
<lb/>menat him for his successor in his business, heard of
<lb/>his improvements with rapture, often saying, <q>My
<lb/>boy will be the ornament of the city, he will be the
<lb/>best scholar in any shop in <placeName>London</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb/>He was soon, however, taught another lesson;
<lb/>when, at the age of sixteen, he returned home, and
<lb/>was placed in the shop, instead of applying his talents
<lb/>as his father had expected, to trade, he both despised
<lb/>and abhorred the name of it; when serious, treating
<lb/>it with contempt, when gay, with derision.</p>
<p><lb/>He was seized, also, with a most ardent desire to fi
<lb/>nish his education, like those of his school-fellows who
	  <lb/>left <name>Eaton</name> at the same time, at one of the Universities;
<lb/>and, after many difficulties, this petition, at the inter
<lb/>cession of his mother, was granted, old <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>
<lb/>telling him he hoped a little more learning would
<lb/>give him a little more sense, and that when he became
<lb/>a <emph>finished student</emph>, he would not only know the true
<lb/>value of business, but understand how to get money,
<lb/>and make a bargain, better than any man whatsoever
<lb/>within Temple-Bar.</p>
<p><lb/>These expectations, equally short-sighted, were
<lb/>also equally fallacious with the former:  the son again
<lb/>returned, and returned, as his father had hoped, a
<pb n="285"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">281</mw>
<lb/><emph>finished student;</emph> but, far from being more tractable,
<lb/>or better disposed for application to trade, his aver
<lb/>sion to it now was more stubborn, and his opposition
<lb/>more hardy than ever.  The young men of fashion
<lb/>with whom he had formed friendships at school, or at
<lb/>the university, and with whom, from the indulgence
<lb/>of his father, he was always able to vie in expence,
<lb/>and from the indulgence of nature to excel in capa
<lb/>city, earnestly sought the continuance of his acquaint
<lb/>ance, and courted and coveted the pleasure of his
<lb/>conversation:  but though he was now totally disquali
<lb/>fied for any other society, he lost all delight in
<lb/>their favour from the fear they should discover his
<lb/>abode, and sedulously endeavoured to avoid even oc
<lb/>casionally meeting them, lest any of his family should
<lb/>at the same time approach him:  for of his family,
<lb/>though wealthy, worthy, and independent, he was
<lb/>now so utterly ashamed, that the mortification the
<lb/>most cruel he could receive, was to be asked his
<lb/>address, or told he should be visited.</p>
<p><lb/>Tired, at length, of evading the enquiries made by
<lb/>some, and forcing faint laughs at the detection made
<lb/>by others, he privately took a lodging at the west end
<lb/>of the town, to which he thenceforward directed all
<lb/>his friends, and where, under various pretences, he
<lb/>contrived to spend the greatest part of his time.</p>
<p><lb/>In all his expensive deceits and frolics, his mother
<lb/>was his never-failing confident and assistant; for when
<lb/>she heard that the companions of her son were men of
<lb/>fashion, some born to titles, others destined to high
<lb/>stations, she concluded he was in the certain road to
<lb/>honour and profit, and frequently distressed herself,
<lb/>without ever repining, in order to enable him to pre
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">12.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">2N</mw>
<pb n="286"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N1v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">282</mw>
<lb/>serve upon equal terms, connections which she be
<lb/>lieved so conducive to his future grandeur.</p>
<p><lb/>In this wild and unsettled manner he passed some
<lb/>time, struggling incessantly against the authority of
<lb/>his father, privately abetted by his mother, and con
<lb/>stantly aided and admired by his sisters:  till, sick of
<lb/>so desultory a way of life, he entered himself a volun
<lb/>teer in the army.</p>
<p><lb/>How soon he grew tired of this change has already
<lb/>been related, as well as his reconciliation with his
<lb/>father, and his becoming a student at the Temple:  for
<lb/>the father now grew as weary of opposing as the
<lb/>young man of being opposed.</p>
<p><lb/>Here, for two or three years, he lived in happiness
<lb/>uninterrupted:  he extended his acquaintance among
<lb/>the great, by whom he was no sooner known than ca
<lb/>ressed and admired, and he frequently visited his
<lb/>family, which, though he blushed to own in public, he
<lb/>affectionately loved in private.  His profession, in
<lb/>deed, was but little in his thoughts, successive engage
<lb/>ments occupying almost all his hours.  Delighted with
<lb/>the favour of the world, and charmed to find his pre
<lb/>sence seemed the signal for entertainment, he soon
<lb/>forgot the uncertainty of his fortune, and the infe
<lb/>riority of his rank:  the law grew more and more fati
<lb/>guing, pleasure became more and more alluring, and,
<lb/>by degrees, he had not a day unappropriated to some
<lb/>party or amusement:  voluntarily consigning the few
<lb/>leisure moments his gay circle afforded him, to the in
<lb/>dulgence of his fancy in some hasty compositions in
<lb/>verse, which were handed about in manuscript, and
<lb/>which contributed to keep him in fashion.</p>
<p><lb/>Such was his situation at the death of his father; a
<pb n="287"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">283</mw>
<lb/>new scene was then opened to him, and for some time
<lb/>he hesitated what course to pursue.</p>
<p><lb/>Old <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, though he lived in great affluence
<lb/>left not behind him any considerable fortune, after
<lb/>the portions of his daughters, to each of whom he be
<lb/>queathed 2000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. had been deducted from it.  But his
<lb/>stock in trade was great, and his business was prospe
<lb/>rous and lucrative.</p>
<p><lb/>His son, however, did not merely want application
<lb/>and fortitude to become his successor, but skill and
<lb/>knowledge; his deliberation, therefore, was hasty,
<lb/>and his resolution improvident; he determined to
<lb/>continue at the Temple himself, while the shop, which
<lb/>he could by no means afford to relinquish, should be
<lb/>kept up by another name, and the business of it be
<lb/>transacted by an agent; hoping thus to secure and
<lb/>enjoy its emoluments, without either the trouble or
<lb/>the humiliation of attendance.</p>
<p><lb/>But this scheme, like most others that have their
<lb/>basis in vanity, ended in nothing but mortification and
	  <lb/>disappointment:  the shop which under old <persName>Mr. Bel
<lb/>field</persName> had been flourishing and successful, and enriched
<lb/>himself and all his family, could now scarce support
<lb/>the expences of an individual.  Without a master,
<lb/>without that diligent attention to its prosperity which
<lb/>the interest of possession alone can give, and the au
<lb/>thority of a principal alone can enforce, it quickly lost
<lb/>its fame for the excellence of its goods, and soon after
<lb/>its customers from the report of its declension.  The
<lb/>produce, therefore, diminished every month; he was
<lb/>surprised, he was provoked; he was convinced he
<lb/>was cheated, and that his affairs were neglected; but
<lb/>though he threatened from time to time to enquire
<pb n="288"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">284</mw>
<lb/>into the real state of the business, and investigate the
<lb/>cause of its decay, he felt himself inadequate to the
<lb/>task; and now first lamented that early contempt of
<lb/>trade, which by preventing his acquiring some know
<lb/>ledge of it while he had youth and opportunity, made
<lb/>him now ignorant what redress to seek; though cer
<lb/>tain of imposition and injury.</p>
<p><lb/>But yet, however disturbed by alarming suggestions
<lb/>in his hours of retirement, no alteration was made in
<lb/>the general course of his life; he was still the darling
<lb/>of his friends, and the leader in all parties, and still,
<lb/>though his income was lessened, his expences in
<lb/>creased.</p>
<p><lb/>Such were his circumstances at the time <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>first saw him at the house of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>:  from
<lb/>which, two days after her arrival in town, he was him
<lb/>self summoned, by an information that his agent had
<lb/>suddenly left the kingdom.</p>
<p><lb/>The fatal consequence of this fraudulent elopement
<lb/>was immediate bankruptcy.</p>
<p><lb/>His spirits, however, did not yet fail him; as he
<lb/>had never been the nominal master of the shop, he es
<lb/>caped all dishonour from its ruin, and was satisfied to
<lb/>consign what remained to the mercy of the creditors,
<lb/>so that his own name should not appear in the Ga
<lb/>zette.</p>
<p><lb/>Three of his sisters were already extremely well
<lb/>married to reputable tradesmen; the two elder of
<lb/>those who were yet single were settled with two of
	  <lb/>those who were married, and <persName>Henrietta</persName>, the youngest,
<lb/>resided with her mother, who had a comfortable an
	  <lb/>nuity and a small house at <placeName>Paddington</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb/>Bereft thus through vanity and imprudence of all
<pb n="289"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">285</mw>
<lb/>the long labours of his father, he was now compelled
<lb/>to think seriously of some actual method of mainte
<lb/>nance; since his mother, though willing to sacrifice
<lb/>to him even the nourishment which sustained her,
<lb/>could do for him but little, and that little he had too
<lb/>much justice to<sic corr="">o</sic> accept.  The law, even to the most
<lb/>diligent and successful, is extremely slow of profit,
<lb/>and whatever, from his connections and abilities might
<lb/>be hoped hereafter, at present required an expence
<lb/>which he was no longer able to support.</p>
<p><lb/>It remained then to try his influence with his friends
<lb/>among the great and the powerful.</p>
<p><lb/>His canvass proved extremely honourable; every
<lb/>one promised something, and all seemed delighted to
<lb/>have an opportunity of serving him.</p>
<p><lb/>Pleased with finding the world so much better than
<lb/>report had made it, he now saw the conclusion of his
<lb/>difficulties in the prospect of a place at court.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Belfield</persName>, with half the penetration with which he
<lb/>was gifted, would have seen in any other man the
<lb/>delusive idleness of expectations no better founded;
<lb/>but though discernment teaches us the folly of others,
<lb/>experience singly can teach us our own! he flattered
<lb/>himself that his friends had been more wisely selected
<lb/>than the friends of those who in similar circumstances
<lb/>had been beguiled; and he suspected not the fraud of
<lb/>his vanity, till he found his invitations daily slacken,
<lb/>and that his time was at his own command.</p>
<p><lb/>All his hopes now rested upon one friend and pa
	  <lb/>tron, <persName>Mr. Floyer</persName>, and uncle of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, a
<lb/>man of power in the royal household, with whom he
<lb/>had lived in great intimacy, and who at this period
<lb/>had the disposal of a place which he solicited.  The
<pb n="290"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">286</mw>
	  <lb/>only obstacle which seemed in his way was from <persName>Sir
<lb/>Robert</persName> himself, who warmly exerted his interest in
	  <lb/>favour of a friend of his own.  <persName>Mr. Floyer</persName>, however,
<lb/>assured Belfield of the preference, and only begged
<lb/>his patience till he could find some opportunity of ap
<lb/>peasing his nephew.</p>
<p><lb/>And this was the state of his affairs at the time of
<lb/>his quarrel at the Opera-house.  Already declared op
	  <lb/>ponents of each other, <persName>Sir Robert</persName> felt double wrath
<lb/>that for <emph>him</emph> <persName>Cecilia</persName> should reject his civilities; while
<lb/>Belfield, suspecting he presumed upon his known de
<lb/>pendence on his uncle to affront him, felt also double
<lb/>indignation at the haughtiness of his behaviour.  And
<lb/>thus, slight as seemed to the world the cause of their
<lb/>contest, each had private motives of animosity that
<lb/>served to stimulate revenge.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>The very day after this duel, <persName>Mr. Floyer</persName> wrote him
<lb/>word that he was now obliged in common decency to
<lb/>take the part of his nephew, and therefore had already
<lb/>given the place to the friend he had recommended.</p>
<p><lb/>This was the termination of his hopes, and the sig
<lb/>nal of his ruin!  To the pain of his wound he became
<lb/>insensible, from the superior pain of this unexpected
<lb/>miscarriage; yet his pride still enabled him to dis
<lb/>guise his distress, and to see all the friends whom this
<lb/>accident induced to seek him, while from the spright
<lb/>liness he forced in order to conceal his anguish, he
<lb/>appeared to them more lively and more entertaining
<lb/>than ever.</p>
<p><lb/>But these efforts, when left to himself and to nature,
<lb/>only sunk him the deeper in sadness; he found an
<lb/>immediate change in his way of life was necessary,
<pb n="291"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N4r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">287</mw>
<lb/>yet could not brook to make it in sight of those with
<lb/>whom he had so long lived in all the brilliancy of
<lb/>equality.  A high principle of honour which still, in
<lb/>the midst of his gay career, had remained uncorrupted,
<lb/>had scrupulously guarded him from running into debt,
<lb/>and therefore, though of little possessed, that little
<lb/>was strictly his own.  He now published that he was
<lb/>going out of town for the benefit of purer air, dis
<lb/>charged his surgeon, took a gay leave of his friends,
<lb/>and trusting no one with his secret but his servant,
<lb/>was privately conveyed to mean and cheap lodgings
	  <lb/>in <placeName>Swallow-street</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb/>Here, shut up from every human being he had for
<lb/>merly known, he puposed to remain till he grew bet
<lb/>ter, and then again to seek his fortune in the army.</p>
<p><lb/>His present situation, however, was little calculated
<lb/>to contribute to his recovery; the dismission of the
<lb/>surgeon, the precipitation of his removal, the inconve
<lb/>niences of his lodgings, and the unseasonable depriva
<lb/>tion of long customary indulgencies, were unavoidable
<lb/>delays of his amendment; while the mortification of
<lb/>the present disgrace, and the bitterness of his late
<lb/>disappointment, preyed incessantly upon his mind,
<lb/>robbed him of rest, heightened his fever, and reduced
<lb/>him by degrees to a state so low and dangerous, that
<lb/>his servant, alarmed for his life, secretly acquainted
<lb/>his mother with his illness and retreat.</p>
<p><lb/>The mother, almost distracted by this intelligence,
<lb/>instantly, with her daughter, flew to his lodgings.  She
<lb/>wished to have taken him immediately to her house at
<lb/>Paddington, but he suffered so much from his first re
<lb/>moval, that he would not consent to another.  She
<lb/>would then have called in a physician, but he refused
<pb n="292"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">288</mw>
<lb/>even to see one; and she had too long given way to
<lb/>all his desires and opinions, to have now the force of
<lb/>mind for exerting the requisite authority of issuing
<lb/>her orders without consulting him.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>She begged, she pleaded, indeed, and <persName>Henrietta</persName>
<lb/>joined in her entreaties; but sickness and vexatio<sic corr="n">m</sic>
<lb/>had not rendered him tame, though they had made
<lb/>him sullen:  he resisted their prayers, and commonly
<lb/>silenced them by assurances that their opposition to
<lb/>the plan he had determined to pursue, only inflamed
<lb/>his fever, and retarded his recovery.</p>
<p><lb/>The motive of an obduracy so cruel to his friends
<lb/>was the fear of a detection which he thought not
<lb/>merely prejudicial to his affairs, but dishonourable to
<lb/>his character:  for, without betraying any symptom of
<lb/>his distress, he had taken a general leave of his ac
<lb/>quaintance, upon pretence of going out of town, and
<lb/>he could ill endure to make a discovery which would
<lb/>at once proclaim his degradation and his deceit.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Albany</persName> had accidentally broken in upon him,
<lb/>by mistaking his room for that of another sick person
<lb/>in the same house, to whom his visit had been in
<lb/>tended; but as he knew and reverenced that old gen
<lb/>tleman, he did not much repine at his intrusion.</p>
<p><lb/>He was not so easy when the same discovery was
<lb/>made by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, who chancing to meet his ser
<lb/>vant in the street, enquired concerning his master's
<lb/>health, and surmising from him its real state, followed
<lb/>him home; where, soon certain of the change of his
<lb/>habitation, he wrote him a letter, in which, after apo
<lb/>logizing for his freedom, he warmly declared that no
<lb/>thing could make him so happy as being favoured with
<lb/>his commands, if, either through himself or his friends,
<lb/>he could be so fortunate as to do him any service.</p>

<p>
	  <lb/><persName>Belfield</persName>, deeply mortified at this detection of his
<lb/>situation, returned only a verbal answer of cold thanks,
<lb/>and desired he would not speak of his being in town,
<lb/>as he was not well enough to be seen.</p>
<p><lb/>This reply gave almost equal mortification to young
	  <lb/><persName>Delvile</persName>, who continued, however, to call at the door
<lb/>with enquiries how he went on, though he made no
<lb/>further attempt to see him.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Belfield</persName>, softened at length by the kindness of this
<lb/>conduct, determined to admit him; and he was just
<lb/>come from paying his first visit, when he was met by
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> upon the stairs.</p>
<p><lb/>His stay with him had been short, and he had taken
<lb/>no notice either of his change or abode, or his pretence
<lb/>of going into the country; he had talked to him only
<lb/>in general terms and upon general subjects, till he
<lb/>arose to depart, and then he re-urged his offers of
	  <lb/>service with so much openness and warmth, that <persName>Bel

<lb/><q>My mother,</q> she added, <q>who never quits him,

<lb/>sery she had already, though so very young, spent
<lb/><emph>two years in nothing but unhappiness?</emph></p>
<p><lb/><q>Because,</q> she answered, <q>when my poor father
<lb/>died all our family separated, and I left every body
	    <lb/>to go and live with my mother at <placeName>Paddington</placeName>; and I
<lb/>was never a favourite with my mother,no more, in
<lb/>deed, was any body but my brother, for she thinks all
<lb/>the rest of the world only made for his sake.  So she
<lb/>used to deny both herself and me almost common ne
<lb/>cessaries, in order to save up money to make him pre
<lb/>sents:  though, if he had known how it was done, he
<lb/>would only have been angry instead of taking them.
<lb/>However, I should have regarded nothing that had
<lb/>but been for his benefit, for I loved him a great deal
<lb/>more than my own convenience; but sums that would
<lb/>distress us for months to save up, would by him be
<lb/>spent in a day, and then thought of no more!  Nor
<lb/>was that allO no!  I had much greater uneasiness
<lb/>to suffer; for I was informed by one of my brother's
<lb/>in-law how ill every thing went, and that certain ruin
<lb/>would come to my poor brother from the treachery of
<lb/>his agent; and the thought of this was always preying
<lb/>upon my mind, for I did not dare tell it my mother,
<lb/>for it should put her out of humour, for, some
<lb/>times, she is not very patient; and it mattered little
<lb/>what any of us said to my brother, for he was too gay
<lb/>and too confident to believe his danger.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Well, but,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I hope, now, all will
<lb/>go better; if your brother will consent to see a phy
<lb/>sician</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Ah, madam! that is the thing I fear he never
<lb/>will do, because of being seen in these bad lodgings.

<lb/>I would kneel whole days to prevail with him, but he
<lb/>is unused to controul, and knows not how to submit to
<lb/>it; and he has lived so long among the great, that he
<lb/>forgets he was not born as high as themselves.  Oh
<lb/>that he had never quitted his own family!  If he had
<lb/>not been spoilt by ambition, he had the best heart and
<lb/>sweetest disposition in the world.  But living always
<lb/>with his superiors, taught him to disdain his own rela
<lb/>tions, and be ashamed of us all; and yet now, in the
<lb/>hour of his distresswho else comes to help him?</q></p>
<p><lb rend="pre()"/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then enquired if she wanted not assistance
<lb/>for herself and her mother, observing that they did
<lb/>not seem to have all the conveniencies to which they
<lb/>were entitled.</p>
<p><lb/><q id="YW23">Why indeed, madam,</q> she replied, with an inge
<lb/>nuous smile, <q id="YW24">when you first came here I was a little
<lb/>like my brother, for I was sadly ashamed to let you
<lb/>see how ill we lived! but now you know the worst,
<lb/>so I shalll fret about it no more.</q>
<lb/><q>But this cannot be your usual way of life; I
<lb/>fear the misfortunes of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> have spread a
<lb/>ruin wider than his own.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>No indeed; he took care from the first not to in
<lb/>volve us in his hazards, for he is very generous,
<lb/>madam, and very noble in all his notions, and could
<lb/>behave to us all no better about money matters than
<lb/>he has ever done.  But from the moment we came to
<lb/>this dismal place, and saw his distress, and that <emph>he</emph> was
<lb/>sunk so low who used always to be higher than any of
<lb/>us, we had a sad scene indeed!  My poor mother, whose
<lb/>whole delight was to think that he lived like a noble

<lb/>tracted with her disappointment, that she would not
<lb/>listen to reason, but immediately discharged both our
<lb/>servants, said she and I should do all the work our
<lb/>selves, hired this poor room for us to live in, and sent
<lb/>to order a bill to be put upon her house at Paddington,
<lb/>for she said she would never return to it any more.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE147">But are you then,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE148">without any
<lb/>servant?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>We have my brother's man, madam, and so he
<lb/>lights our fires, and takes away some of our litters;
<lb/>and there is not much else to be done, except sweeping
<lb/>the rooms, for we eat nothing but cold meat from the
<lb/>cook shops.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>And how long is this to last?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>Indeed I cannot tell; for the real truth is, my
<lb/>poor mother has almost lost her senses; and ever
<lb/>since our coming here, she has been so miserable and
<lb/>so complaining, that indeed, between her and my bro
<lb/>ther, I have almost lost mine too!  For when she
<lb/>found all her hopes at an end, and that her darling
<lb/>son, instead of being rich and powerful, and sur
<lb/>rounded by friends and admirers, all trying who should
<lb/>do most for him, was shut up by himself in such a
<lb/>little lodging, and instead of gaining wealth, had spent
<lb/>all he was worth at first, without a creature to come
<lb/>near him, though ill, though confined, though keeping
<lb/>his bed!Oh madam, had you seen my poor mother
<lb/>when she first cast her eyes upon him in that condi

<p><lb/><q id="CE149">I wonder not at her disappointment,</q> cried Ce

<lb/>continually reproaching herself for always complying
<lb/>with his humours, and assisting him to appear better
<lb/>than the rest of his family, though my father never
<lb/>approved her doing so.  But she thought herself so
<lb/>sure of his rising, that she believed we should all
<lb/>thank her for it in the end.  And she always used to
<lb/>say that he was born to be a gentleman, and what a
<lb/>grievous thing it would be to have him made a trades
<lb/>man.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>I hope, at least, she has not the additional misery
<lb/>of seeing him ungrateful for her fondness, however in
<lb/>judicious it may have been?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>O no! he does nothing but comfort and cheer
<lb/>her! and indeed it is very good of him, for he has
<lb/>owned to me in private, that but for her encourage
<lb/>ment, he could not have run the course he has run,
<lb/>for he should have been obliged to enter into business,
<lb/>whether he had liked it or not.  But my poor mother
<lb/>knows this, though he will not tell it her, and there
<lb/>fore she says that unless he gets well she will punish
<lb/>herself all the rest of her life, and never go back to
<lb/>her house, and never hire another servant, and never

<p><lb/><q>No, madam, not by her fault, for she wants me

<lb/>sent, because my poor brother is in so much distress,
<lb/>that all we save may be really turned to account; but
<lb/>when we lived so hardly only to procure him luxuries
<lb/>he had no right to, I must own I used often to think it

<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> now began to think it high time to release

<lb/>a private scheme for serving her more effectually than

        <p><lb/>The raillery of young <persName>Delvile</persName>, however, had taught

            <lb/>and restless desire to be herself the means of extri

        <p><lb/><q id="RA1">I know already where he lies, madam,</q> answered

        <p><lb/>This answer unravelled to <persName>Cecilia</persName> a mystery which

            <lb/>Delvile when he had surprised her in that situation
            <lb/>were now fully explained.  In seeing her come out
            <lb/>of the surgeon's house, he had naturally concluded
            <lb/>she had only entered it to ask news of his patient, <persName>Mr.

            <lb/>hints at her reserve and dissimulation, were meant
            <lb/>but to reproach her for refusing his offer of procuring
            <lb/>her intelligence, at the very time when, to all ap
            <lb/>pearance, she anxiously, though clandestinely, sought
            <lb/>it for herself.</p>
        <p><lb/>This discovery, notwithstanding it relieved her
            <lb/>from all suspence of his meaning, gave her much
            <lb/>vexation:  to be supposed to take an interest so
            <lb/>ardent, yet so private, in the affairs of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
            <lb/>might well authorise all suspicions of her partiality
            <lb/>for him:  and even if any doubt had yet remained, the
            <lb/>unlucky meeting upon the stairs at his lodgings,
            <lb/>would not fail to dispel it, and confirm the notion of
            <lb/>her secret regard.  She hoped, however, to have
            <lb/>soon some opportunity of clearing up the mistake,
            <lb/>and resolved in the mean time to be studiously
            <lb/>cautious in avoiding all appearances that might
            <lb/>strengthen it.</p>
        <p><lb/>No caution, however, and no apprehension, could

            <lb/>ous, and she could not trust to the penny-post, as
            <lb/>her proposal required an answer.  After much deli

            <lb/><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, to whose services she was entitled, and

        <p><lb/>The morning was already far advanced, but the

            <lb/>therefore immediately to <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, whom she found
            <lb/>already removed into her new habitation in <placeName>Fetter-lane</placeName>,
            <lb/>and equally busy and happy in the change of scene and
            <lb/>of employment.  She gave to her a note, which she
            <lb/>desired her to carry to <placeName>Cavendish-street</placeName> directly, and
            <lb/>either to deliver it to <persName>Mr. Rupil's</persName> own hands, or to
            <lb/>bring it back if he was out; but upon no considera

        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> then lookedand perceived young <persName>Delvile</persName>!
            <lb/>who, after stopping a moment at the door, came into
            <lb/>the shop, and desired to be shewn some gloves, which,
            <lb/>among other things, were laid in the window.</p>
        <p><lb/>Extremely disconcerted at the sight of him, she be

        <p><lb/>As soon as he saw he was observed by her, he
            <lb/>bowed with the utmost respect:  she coloured in re

            <lb/>vexation, for another attack, and further raillery,
            <lb/>similar to what she had already received from him:

        <p><lb/>A silence so unexpected at once astonished and dis
            <lb/>turbed her; she again desired to hear all that had
            <lb/>passed at <persName>Mr. Rupil's</persName>, and from the relation gathered
            <lb/>that <persName>Delvile</persName> had himself undertaken to be responsi
            <lb/>ble for his attendance upon <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>.</p>
        <p><lb/>A liberality so like her own failed not to impress
            <lb/>her with the most lively esteem:  but this served ra
            <lb/>ther to augment than lessen the pain with which she
            <lb/>considered the clandestine appearance she thus re
            <lb/>peatedly made to him.  She had no doubt he had
            <lb/>immediately concluded she was the author of the applica
            <lb/>tion to the surgeon, and that he followed her mes
            <lb/>senger merely to ascertain the fact; while his silence
            <lb/>when he had made the discovery, she could only
            <lb/>attribute to his now believing that her regard for <persName>Mr.
                <lb/>Belfield</persName> was too serious for raillery.</p>
        <p><lb/>Doubly, however, she rejoiced at the generosity
            <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName>, as it rendered wholly unnecessary her
            <lb/>further interference:  for she now saw with some
            <lb/>alarm the danger to which benevolence iteslf, directed
            <lb/>towards a youthful object, might expose her.</p></div>

                <lb/>waiting upon her every afternoon?</q></p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was thunderstruck by this speech, which
            <lb/>not only expressed an open avowal of his pretensions,
            <lb/>but a confident security of his success.  She was
            <lb/>shocked that a man of such principles should even

        <p><lb/>His intimation of coming to the house for <emph>the hap

            <lb/>without losing a moment to seek herself an explana
            <lb/>tion with him:  while the discovery that he was in
            <lb/>cluded in the Easter party, which various other con
            <lb/>comitant causes had already rendered disagreeable to
            <lb/>her, made her look forward to that proposed expe
            <lb/>dition with nothing but unwillingness and distaste.</p>
        <p><lb/>But though her earnestness to conclude this affair
            <lb/>made her now put herself voluntarily in the way of
            <lb/>the Baronet, she found plans counteracted by <persName>Mr.
                <lb/>Harrel</persName>, who, with an officiousness too obvious to
            <lb/>pass for chance, constantly stopt the progress of any
            <lb/>discourse in which he himself did not bear a part.
            <lb/>A more passionate admirer might not have been so
            <lb/>easily defeated; but <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, too proud for solici
            <lb/>tation, and too indolent for assiduity, was very soon
            <lb/>checked, because very soon wearied.</p>
        <p><lb/>The whole evening, therefore, to her infinite mor
            <lb/>tification, passed away without affording her any
            <lb/>opportunity of making known to him his mistake.</p>
        <p><lb/>Her next effort was to remonstrate with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
            <lb/>himself; but this scheme was not more easy of execu
            <lb/>tion than the other, since <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, suspecting she
            <lb/>meant again to dun him for her money, avoided all
            <lb/><sic corr="">all</sic> separate conversation with her so skilfully, that
            <lb/>she could not find a moment to make him hear her.</p>
        <p><lb/>She then resolved to apply to his lady; but here
            <lb/>her success was not better.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, dreading
            <lb/>another lecture upon conomy, peevishly answered
            <lb/>to her request of a conference, that she was not very
            <lb/>well, and could not talk gravely.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, justly offended with them all, had now no
            <lb/>resource but in <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, whose counsel for
            <pb n="306"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2P3v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">302</mw>
            <lb/>effectually dismissing the baronet, she determined to
            <lb/>solicit by the first opportunity.</p>
        <p><lb/>The moment, therefore, that she next saw him,
            <lb/>she acquainted him with the speeches of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
            <lb/>and the bahaviour of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/>There needed no rhetoric to point out to <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Monckton</persName> the danger of suffering such expectations,
            <lb/>or the impropriety of her present situation:  he was
            <lb/>struck with both in a manner the most forcible, and
            <lb/>spared not for warmth of expression to alarm her deli
            <lb/>cacy, or add to her displeasure.  But chiefly he was
            <lb/>exasperated against <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, assuring her there
            <lb/>could be no doubt but that he had some particular
            <lb/>interest in so strenuously and artfully supporting the
            <lb/>pretensions of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> endeavoured to
            <lb/>refute this opinion, which she regarded as proceed
            <lb/>ing rather from prejudice than justice; but when she
            <lb/>mentioned that the baronet was invited to spend the
            <lb/>Easter holidays at <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>, he represented with
            <lb/>such energy the consequent constructions of the world,
            <lb/>as well as the unavoidable encouragement such inti
            <lb/>macy would imply, that he terrified her into an earnest
            <lb/>entreaty to suggest to her some way of deliverance.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="MN13">There is only one,</q> answered he, <q id="MN14">you must
            <lb/>peremptorily refuse to go to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName> yourself.
            <lb/>If, after what has passed, you are included in the
            <lb/>same party with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, you give a sanction
            <lb/>yourself to the reports already circulated of your en
            <lb/>gagements with him:  and the effect of such a sanc
            <lb/>tion will be more serious than you can easily ima
            <lb/>gine, since the knowledge that a connection is
            <lb/>believed in the world, frequently, if not generally,
            <lb/>leads by imperceptible degrees to its real ratification.</q></p>

            <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, with the utmost alacrity, promised im
            <lb/>plicitly to follow his advice, whatever might be the
            <lb/>opposition of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.  He quitted her, therefore,
            <lb/>with unusual satisfaction, happy in his power over
            <lb/>her mind, and anticipating with secret rapture the
            <lb/>felicity he had in reserve from visiting her during the
            <lb/>absence of the family.</p>
        <p><lb/>As no private interview was necessary for making
            <lb/>known her intention of giving up the Easter party,
            <lb/>which was to take place in two days time, she men
            <lb/>tioned the next morning her design of spending the
            <lb/>holidays in town, when <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> sauntered into
            <lb/>the breakfast room to give some commission to his
            <lb/>lady.</p>
        <p><lb/>At first he only laughed at her plan, gaily rallying
            <lb/>her upon the love of solitude; but when he found it
            <lb/>was serious, he very warmly opposed it, and called
            <lb/>upon <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to join in his expostulations.
            <lb/>That lady complied, but in so faint a manner, that
            <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> soon saw she did not wish to prevail; and
            <lb/>with a concern that cost her infinite pain, now finally
            <lb/>perceived that not only all her former affection was
            <lb/>subsided into indifference, but that, since she had
            <lb/>endeavoured to abridge her amusements, she re
            <lb/>garded her as a spy, and dreaded her as the censor
            <lb/>of her conduct.</p>
        <p><lb/>Mean while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who was present, though
            <lb/>he interfered not in the debate, waited the event
            <lb/>with anxiety; naturally hoping her objections arose
            <lb/>from her dislike of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, and secretly resolving
            <lb/>to be guided himself by her motions.</p>
        <p>	  <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> at length, tired of the importunities of <persName>Mr.
            <lb/>Harrel</persName>, gravely said, that if he desired to hear the

            <lb/>reasons which obliged her to refute his request, she
            <lb/>was ready to communicate them.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, after a little hesitation, accompanied
            <lb/>her into another room.</p>
        <p><lb/>She then declared her resolution not to live under
            <lb/>the same roof with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, and very openly ex
            <lb/>pressed her vexation and displeasure that he so evi
            <lb/>dently persisted in giving that gentleman encourage
            <lb/>ment.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="HA31">My dear <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> answered he, carelessly,

        <p><lb/><q id="HA33">I fancy,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, laughing, <q id="HA34">you
            <lb/>will not easily persuade him to think so:  your be

        <p><lb/><q>My behaviour at the Opera-house, Sir, I have

        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, equally surprised and provoked by this
            <lb/>speech, could not for a moment tell how to answer
            <lb/>it; and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, wilfully misinterpreting her
            <lb/>silence, took her hand, and said, <q>Come, I am sure
                <lb/>you have too much honour to make a fool of such a

        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was so much incensed by this impracticable

            <lb/>she went directly to her own room.  It was easy for

            <lb/>every method he could devise, to entangle her to some
            <lb/>engagement with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, and though she could
            <lb/>not imagine the meaning of such a scheme, the little
            <lb/>ness of his behaviour excited her contempt, and the
            <lb/>long-continued error of the baronet gave her the ut
            <lb/>most uneasiness.  She again determined to seek an
            <lb/>explanation with him herself, and immovably to re

            <lb/>by yourself?</q> replied he, <q id="HA41">You cannot suppose that
                <lb/>will be an eligible plan for a young lady.  On the
                <lb/>contrary, it will be so very improper, that I think
                <lb/>myself, as your guardian, obliged to oppose it.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>Amazed at this authoritative speech, <persName>Cecilia</persName> looked
            <lb/>at him with a mixture of mortification and anger;
            <pb n="311"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2Q2r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">307</mw>
            <lb/>but knowing it would be vain to resist his power if
            <lb/>he was resolute to exert it, she made not any answer.</p>
        <p><lb/><q id="HA42">Besides,</q> he continued, <q id="HA43">I have a plan for some
            <lb/>alterations in the house during my absence; and I
            <lb/>think your room, in particular, will be much im
            <lb/>proved by them; but it will be impossible to employ
            <lb/>any workmen, if we do not all quit the premises.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>This determined persecution now seriously alarmed
            <lb/>her; she saw that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> would omit no ex
            <lb/>pedient or stratagem to encourage the adresses of
            <lb/>Sir Robert, and force her into his presence; and
            <lb/>she began next to apprehend that her connivance in
            <lb/>his conduct might be presumed upon by that gentle
            <lb/>man:  she resolved, therefore, as the last and only
            <lb/>effort in her power for avoiding him, to endeavour
            <lb/>to find an accomodation at the house of <persName>Mrs. Del
                <lb/>vile</persName>, during the excurison to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>:  and if,
            <lb/>when she returned to <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, the Baronet
            <lb/>still persevered in his attendance, to entreat her
            <lb/>friend <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> would take upon himself the
            <lb/>charge of undeceiving him.</p></div>

<p><lb/>She found <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> alone, and still at break
<lb/>fast.</p>



<p>
<lb/>After the first compliments were over, while she
<lb/>was considering in what manner to introduce her
<lb/>proposal, <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> herself led to the subject, by
<lb/>saying, <q>I am very sorry to hear we are so soon to
<lb/>lose you; but I hope <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> does not intend to
<lb/>make any long stay at his villa:  for if he does, I
<lb/>shall be half tempted to come and run away with
<lb/>you from him.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE162">And that,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, delighted with this
<lb/>opening, <q id="CE163">would be an honour I am <emph>more</emph> than half
<lb/>tempted to desire.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE164">Why indeed your leaving <placeName>London</placeName> just at this
<lb/>time,</q> continued <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, <q id="CE165">is for me, parti
<lb/>cularly unfortunate, as, if I could now be favoured
<lb/>with your visits, I should doubly value them; for
<lb/><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> is gone to spend the holidays at the
	    <lb/>Duke of <placeName>Dervent's</placeName>, whither I was not well enough
<lb/>to accompany him:  my son has his own engage
<lb/>ments, and there are so few people I can bear to see,
<lb/>that I shall live almost entirely alone.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE166">If I,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE167">in such a situation might
<lb/>hope to be admitted, how gladly for that happiness
	    <lb/>would I exchange my expedition to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="DL15">You are very good, and very amiable.</q> said <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName>, <q id="DL16">and your society would indeed give me
<lb/>infinite satisfaction.  Yet I am no enemy to solitude;
<lb/>on the contrary, company is commonly burthensome
<lb/>to me:  I find few who have any power to give me
<lb/>entertainment, and even of those few, the chief part
<lb/>have in their manners, situation, or characters, an
<lb/>unfortunate <emph>something</emph>, that generally renders a near
<lb/>connection with them inconvenient or disagreeable.
<lb/>There are, indeed, so many draw-backs to regard
<pb n="313"/>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">309</mw>
<lb/>and intimacy, from pride, from propriety, and vari
<lb/>ous other<sic corr=""></sic>collateral causes, that rarely as we meet with
<lb/>people of brilliant parts, there is almost ever some
<lb/>objection to our desire of meeting them again.  Yet to
<lb/>live wholly alone is cheerless and depressing; and
<lb/>with you, at least,</q> taking <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s hand, <q id="DL17">I find
<lb/>not one single obstacle to oppose to a thousand in
<lb/>ducements, which invite me to form a friendship
<lb/>that I can only hope may be as lasting, as I am sure
<lb/>it will be pleasant.</q></p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> expressed her sense of this partiality in the
<lb/>warmest terms; and <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, soon discovering
<lb/>by her manner that she took not any delight in her
	  <lb/>intended visit to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>, began next to question
<lb/>her whether it would be possible for her to give it up.</p>
<p><lb/>She instantly answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>	  <lb/><q id="DL18">And would you really be so obliging,</q> cried <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName>, with some surprise, <q id="DL19">as to bestow upon me
<lb/>the time you had destined for this gay excursion?</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE168">Most willingly,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE169">if you are
<lb/>so good as to wish it.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q>But can you alsofor you must by no means
	    <lb/>remain alone in <placeName>Portman Square</placeName>, manage to live
<lb/>entirely in my house till <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s return?</q></p>
<p><lb/>To this proposal, which was what she most de
<lb/>sired, <persName>Cecilia</persName> gave a glad assent; and <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb/>extremely pleased with her compliance, promised to
<lb/>have an apartment prepared for her immediately.</p>
<p><lb/>She then hastened home, to announce her new
<lb/>plan.</p>
<p><lb/>This she took occasion to do when the family was
<lb/>assembled at dinner.  The surprize with which she
	  <lb/>was heard was very general:  <persName>Sir Robert</persName> seemed at
<pb n="314"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q3v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">310</mw>
<lb/>a loss what conclusion to draw from her information;
<lb/><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was half elated with pleasure, and half
<lb/>depressed with apprehension; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> wondered
<lb/>without any other sensation; and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> him
<lb/>self was evidently the most concerned of the party.</p>
<p><lb/>Every effort of persuasion and importunity he now
<lb/>essayed to prevail upon her to give up this scheme,
<lb/>and still accompany them to the villa; but she
	  <lb/>coolly answered that her engagement with <persName>Mrs. Del
<lb/>vile</persName> was decided, and she had appointed to wait
<lb/>upon her the next morning.</p>
<p><lb/>When her resolution was found so steady, a gen
	  <lb/>neral ill-humour took place of surprise:  <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
<lb/>now had the air of a man who thought himself
<lb/>affronted; <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was wretched from a thousand
<lb/>uncertainties; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, indeed, was still the
<lb/>most indifferent; but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> could hardly re
<lb/>press his disappointment and anger.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, was all gaiety and pleasure:  in re
<lb/>moving only from the house of one guardian to another,
<lb/>she knew she could not be opposed; and the flatter
<lb/>ing readiness with which <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> had anticipated
<lb/>her request, without enquiring into her motives, had
<lb/>relieved her from a situation which now grew ex
<lb/>tremely distressing, without giving to her the pain of
<lb/>making complaints of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.  The absence of
<lb/><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> contributed to her happiness, and she
<lb/>much rejoiced in having now the prospect of a speedy
<lb/>opportunity to explain to his son, whatever had ap
	  <lb/>peared mysterious in her conduct respecting <persName>Mr. Bel
<lb/>field</persName>.  If she had any thing to regret, it was merely
<lb/>the impossibility, at this time of waiting for the
<lb/>counsel of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.</p>



<p>
<lb/>The next morning, while the family was in the
<lb/>midst of preparation for departure, she took leave of
<lb/><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who faintly lamented the loss of her com
	  <lb/>pany, and then hastily made her compliments to <persName>Mr.
<lb/>Harrel</persName> and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and putting herself into a
<lb/>chair, was conveyed to her new habitation.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> received her with the most distin
<lb/>guished politeness; she conducted her to the apart
<lb/>ment which had been prepared for her, led her to
<lb/>the library, which she desired her to make use of as
<lb/>her own, and gave her the most obliging charges to
<lb/>remember that she was in a house of which she had
<lb/>the command.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>Young <persName>Delvile</persName> did not make his appearance till
<lb/>dinner time.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, from recollecting the strange
<lb/>situations in which she had lately been seen by him,
<lb/>blushed extremely when she first met his eyes; but
<lb/>finding him gay and easy, general in his conversation,
<lb/>and undesigning in his looks, she soon recovered from
<lb/>her embarrassment, and passed the rest of the day
<lb/>without any restraint or uneasiness.</p>
<p><lb/>Every hour she spent with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, contri
<lb/>buted to raise in her esteem the mind and understand
<lb/>ing of that lady.  She found, indeed, that it was
<lb/>not for nothing she was accused of pride, but she found
<lb/>at the same time so many excellent qualities, so much
<lb/>true dignity of mind, and so noble a spirit of libera
<lb/>lity, that however great was the respect she seemed
<lb/>to demand, it was always inferior to what she felt
<lb/>inclined to pay.</p>
<p><lb/>Nor was young <persName>Delvile</persName> less rapid in the progress
<lb/>he made in her favour; his character, upon every
<lb/>opportunity of shewing it, rose in her opinion, and
<pb n="316"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q4v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">312</mw>
<lb/>his disposition and manners had a mingled sweetness
<lb/>and vivacity that rendered his society attrctive and
<lb/>his conversation spirited.</p>
<p><lb/>Here therefore, <persName>Cecilia</persName> experienced that happiness
<lb/>she so long had coveted in vain:  her life was neither
<lb/>public nor private, her amusements were neither dis
<lb/>sipated nor retired; the company she saw were either
<lb/>people of high rank or strong parts, and their visits
<lb/>were neither frequent nor long.  The situation she
<lb/>quitted gave a zest to that into which she entered,
<lb/>for she was now no longer shocked by extravagance
<lb/>or levity, no longer tormented with addresses which
<lb/>disgusted her, nor mortified by the ingratitude of the
<lb/>friend she had endeavoured to serve.  All was smooth
<lb/>and serene, yet lively and interesting.</p>
<p><lb/>Her plan, however, of clearing to young <persName>Delvile</persName>
	  <lb/>his mistakes concerning <persName>Belfield</persName>, she could not put
<lb/>in execution; for he now never led to the subject,
<lb/>though he was frequently alone with her, nor seemed
<lb/>at all desirous to renew his former raillery, or re
<lb/>peat his enquiries.  She wondered at this change in
<lb/>him, but chose rather to wait the revival of his own
<lb/>curiosity, than to distress or perplex herself by con
<lb/>triving methods of explanation.</p>
<p><lb/>Situated thus happily, she had now one only anx
<lb/>iety, which was to know whether, and in what man
<lb/>ner, <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> had received his surgeon, as well
<lb/>as the actual state of his own and his sister's affairs:
<lb/>but the fear of again encountering young <persName>Delvile</persName> in
<lb/>suspicious circumstances, deterred her at present
<lb/>from going to their house.  Yet her natural benevo
<lb/>lence, which partial convenience never lulled to
<lb/>sleep, impressing her with an apprehension that her
<pb n="317"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R1r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">313</mw>
<lb/>services might be wanted, she was induced to write
	  <lb/>to <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, though she forbore to visit her.</p>
<p><lb/>Her letter was short, but kind, and to the purpose:
<lb/>she apologized for her officiousness, desired to know
<lb/>if her brother was better, and entreated her in terms
<lb/>the most delicate, to acquaint her if yet she would
<lb/>accept from her any assistance.</p>
<p><lb/>She sent this letter by her servant, who, after
<lb/>waiting a considerable time, brought her the follow
<lb/>ing answer:</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-04"><body>

<p>
<lb/>Ah madam! your goodness quite melts me! we
<lb/>want nothing, however, yet, though I fear we shall
<lb/>not say so much longer.  But though I hope I shall
<lb/>never forget myself so as to be proud and impertinent,
<lb/>I will rather struggle with any hardship than beg,
<lb/>for I will not disoblige my poor brother by any
<lb/>fault that I can help, especially now he is fallen so
<lb/>low.  But, thank heaven, his wound has at last been
<lb/>dressed, for the surgeon has found him out, and he
<lb/>attends him for nothing; though my brother is will
<lb/>ing to part with every thing he is worth in the world,
<lb/>rather than owe that obligation to him:  yet I often
<lb/>wonder why he hates so to be obliged, for when he
<lb/>was rich himself he was always doing something to
<lb/>oblige other people.  But I fear the surgeon thinks
<lb/>him very bad! for he wont speak to us when we fol
<lb/>low him down stairs.</p>
<p><lb/>I am sadly ashamed to send this bad writing, but I
<lb/>dare not ask my brother for any help, because he
<lb/>would only be angry that I wrote any thing about

<lb/>him at all; but indeed I have seen too little good
<lb/>come of pride to think of imitating it:  and as I have
<lb/>not his genius, I am sure there is no need I should
<lb/>have his defects; ill, therefore, as I write, you,
<lb/>madam, who have so much goodness and gentleness,
<lb/>would forgive it, I believe, if it was worse, almost.
<lb/>And though we are not in need of your kind offers,
<lb/>it is a great comfort to me to think there is a lady in
<lb/>the world that, if we come to be quite destitute, and
<lb/>if the proud heart of my poor unhap<sic corr="p"></sic>y brother should
<lb/>be quite broke down, will look upon our distress with

<p>
<lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, much moved by the simplicity of this letter,
<lb/>determined that her very first visit to Portman-square
<lb/>should be to its fair and innocent writer.  And
<lb/>having now an assurance that she was in no imme
<lb/>diate distress, and that her brother was actually un
	  <lb/>der <persName>Mr. Rupil's</persName> care, she dismissed from her mind
<lb/>the only subject of uneasiness that at present had en
<lb/>deavoured to disturb it, and gave herself wholly up
<lb/>to the delightful serenity of unallayed happiness.</p>
<p><lb/>Few are the days of unmixed felicity which we
<lb/>acknowledge while we experience, though many are
<lb/>those we deplore, when by sorrow taught their value,
<lb/>and by misfortune their loss.  Time with <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb/>now glided on with such rapidity, that before she
<pb n="319"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R2r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">315</mw>
<lb/>thought the morning half over, the evening was
<lb/>closed, and ere she was sensible the first week was
<lb/>passed, the second was departed for ever.  More and
<lb/>more pleased with the inmates of her new habita
<lb/>tion, she found the abilities of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> sources
<lb/>inexhaustible of entertainment, and in the disposition
<lb/>and sentiments of her son something so concordant to
<lb/>her own, that almost every word he spoke shewed
<lb/>the sympathy of her minds, and almost every look
<lb/>which caught her eyes was a reciprocation of intel
<lb/>ligence.  Her heart deeply wounded of late by un
<lb/>expected indifference, and undeserved mortification,
<lb/>was now, perhaps, more than usually susceptible of
<lb/>those penetrating and exquisite pleasures which
<lb/>friendship and kindness possess the highest powers
<lb/>of bestowing.  Easy, gay, and airy, she only rose
<lb/>to happiness, and only retired to rest; and not
<lb/>merely heightened was her present enjoyment by
<lb/>her past disappointment, but, carrying her retros
<lb/>pection to her earliest remembrance, she still found
<lb/>her actual situation more peculiarly adapted to her
<lb/>taste and temper, than she had hitherto at any time
<lb/>experienced.</p>
<p><lb/>The very morning that the destined fortnight was
<lb/>elapsed, she received a note from <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, with
<lb/>information of her arrival in town, and an entreaty
	  <lb/>that she would return to <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who, thus happy, had forgot to mark the
<lb/>progress of time, was now all amazement to find the
<lb/>term of her absence so soon past.  She thought of
<lb/>going back with the utmost reluctance, and of quit
<lb/>ting her new abode with the most lively regret.  The
<lb/>representations of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> daily lost their
<pb n="320"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R2v"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">316</mw>
<lb/>force, and notwithstanding her dislike of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
<lb/>she had no wish so earnest as that of being settled in
<lb/>his family for the rest of her minority.</p>
<p><lb/>To effect this was her next thought; yet she knew
<lb/>not how to make the proposal:  but from the uncom
<lb/>mon partiality of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, she hoped, with a very
<lb/>little encouragement, she would lead to it herself.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>Here, however, she was disappointed; <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName>, when she heard of the summons from the
	  <lb/><name>Harrels</name>, expressed her sorrow at losing her, in terms
<lb/>of the most flattering regret, yet seemed to think the
<lb/>parting indispensable, and dropt not the most dis
<lb/>tant hint of attempting to prevent it.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, vexed and disconcerted, then made ar
<lb/>rangements for her departure, which she fixed for
<lb/>the next morning.</p>
<p><lb/>The rest of the day, unlike every other, which for
<lb/>the last fortnight had preceded it, was passed with
	  <lb/>little appearance, and no reality of satisfaction:  <persName>Mrs.
<lb/>Delvile</persName> was evidently concerned, her son openly
<lb/>avowed his chagrin, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> felt the utmost mor
<lb/>tification; yet, though every one was discontented,
<lb/>no effort was made towards obtaining any delay.</p>
<p><lb/>The next morning during breakfast, <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>
<lb/>very elegantly thanked her for granting to her so much
<lb/>of her time, and earnestly begged to see her in future
<lb/>whenever she could be spared from her other friends;
<lb/>protesting she was now so accustomed to her
<lb/>society, that she should require both long and fre
<lb/>quent visits to soften the separation.  This request
<lb/>was very eagerly seconded by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, who
<lb/>warmly spoke his satisfaction that his mother had
<lb/>found so charming a friend, and unaffectedly joined
<pb n="321"/>
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R3r"/>
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">317</mw>
<lb/>in her entreaties that the intimacy might be still more
<lb/>closely cemented.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> had no great difficulty in according her
<lb/>compliance to those demands, of which the kindness
<lb/>and cordiality somewhat lessened her disturbance at
<lb/>the parting.</p>
<p><lb/>When <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s carriage arrived, <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>
<lb/>took a most affectionate leave of her, and her son
<lb/>attended her to the coach.</p>
<p><lb/>In her way down stairs, he stopt her for a few mo
<lb/>ments, and in some confusion said, <q>I wish much to
<lb/>apologize to <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, before her departure,
<lb/>for the very gross mistake of which I have been guilty.
<lb/>I know not if it is possible she can pardon me, and I
<lb/>hardly know myself by what perversity and blindness
<lb/>I persisted so long in my error.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE170">O,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much rejoiced at this voluntary
<lb/>explanation, <q id="CE171">if you are but convinced you were
<lb/>really in an error, I have nothing more to wish.
<lb/>Appearances, indeed, were so strangely against me,
<lb/>that I ought not, perhaps, to wonder they deceived
<lb/>you.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="MO43">This is being candid indeed,</q> answered he, again
<lb/>leading her on:  <q id="MO44">and in truth, though your anxiety
<lb/>was obvious, its cause was obscure, and were any
<lb/>thing is left to conjecture, opinion interferes, and the
<lb/>judgment is easily warped.  My own partiality, how
<lb/>ever, for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, will I hope plead my excuse,
<lb/>as from that, and not from any prejudice against the
<lb/>Baronet, my mistake arose:  on the contrary, so highly
<lb/>I respect your taste and your discernment, that your
<lb/>approbation, when known, can scarcely fail of securing
<lb/>mine.</q></p>



<p>
<lb/>Great as was the astonishment of <persName>Cecilia</persName> at the
<lb/>conclusion of this speech; she was at the coach door
<lb/>before she could make any answer; but Delvile, per
<lb/>ceiving her surprise, added, while he handed her in,
<lb/><q>Is it possible  but no, it is <emph>not</emph> possible I should
<lb/>be again mistaken.  I forebore to speak at all,
<lb/>till I had information by which I could not be mis
<lb/>led.</q></p>
<p><lb/><q id="CE172">I know not in what unaccountable obscurity,</q>
<lb/>cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE173">I, or my affairs, may be involved, but
<lb/>I perceive that the cloud which I had hoped was
<lb/>dissipated, is thicker and more impenetrable that
<lb/>ever.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb/><persName>Delvile</persName> then bowed to her with a look that accused
<lb/>her of insincerity, and the carriage drove away.</p>
<p><lb/>Teazed by these eternal mistakes, and provoked to
<lb/>find that though the object of her supposed partiality
<lb/>was so frequently changed, the notion of her positve
<lb/>engagement with one of the duellists was invariable,
<lb/>she resolved, with all the speed in her power, to
	  <lb/>commission <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> to wait upon <persName>Sir Robert
<lb/>Floyer</persName>, and in her own name give a formal rejection
<lb/>to his proposals, and desire him thenceforward to make
<lb/>known, by every opportunity, their total indepen

	    <lb/>Harrel</persName>, and detesting all intercourse with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>,
<lb/>she now dropt her design of seeking an explanation
<lb/>herself.</p>
<p><lb/>She was received by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> with the same
<lb/>coldness with which she had parted from her.  That
<lb/>lady appeared now to have some uneasiness upon her
<lb/>mind, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> endeavoured to draw from her its
<lb/>cause; but far from seeking any alleviation in friend

<lb/>ship, she studiously avoided her, seeming pained by
	  <lb/>her conversation, and reproached by her sight.  <persName>Ce
<lb/>cilia</persName> perceived this encreasing reserve with much
<lb/>concern, but with more indignation, conscious that
<lb/>her good offices had merited a better reception, and
<lb/>angry to find that her advice had not merely failed of
<lb/>success, but even exposed her to aversion.</p>
<p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, on the contrary, behaved to her with
<lb/>unusual civility, seemed eager to oblige her, and
<lb/>desirous to render his house more agreeable to her
<lb/>than ever.  But in this he did not prosper; for <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb/>immediately upon her return, looking in her apart
<lb/>ment for the projected alterations, and finding none
<lb/>had been made, was so disgusted by such a detection
<lb/>of duplicity, that he sunk yet lower than before in her
<lb/>opinion, and she repined at the necessity she was
<lb/>under of any longer continuing his guest.</p>
<p><lb/>The joy of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> at again seeing her, was
<lb/>visible and sinceree; and not a little was it increased
<lb/>by finding that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who sought not more to avoid
	  <lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, than she was herself
<lb/>avoided by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, talked with pleasure to no
<lb/>body else in the house, and scarcely attempted to
<lb/>conceal that he was the only one of the family who
<lb/>possessed any portion of her esteem.</p>
<p>	  <lb/>Even <persName>Sir Robert</persName> appeared now to have formed a
<lb/>design of paying her rather more respect than he had
<lb/>hitherto thought necessary; but the violence he did
<lb/>himself was so evident, and his imperious nature
<lb/>seemed so repugnant to the task, that his insolence
<lb/>breaking forth by starts, and checked only by com
<lb/>pulsion, was but the more conspicuous from his
<lb/>inadequate efforts to disguise it.</p></div>

        <p><lb/><q>No, indeed, madam; my mother does every thing

        <p><lb/><q>It is not that I think myself he will die of his

        <p><lb/><q>O no, the country air can do nothing for him!
            <lb/>for I will not deceive you, madam, for that would be

            <lb/>people for wearing false appearances:  besides, you
            <lb/>are so good and so gentle, that it quite composes me
            <lb/>to talk with you.  So I will honestly speak the truth,
            <lb/>and the whole truth at once; my poor brother is lost

            <lb/>he forgets his father was a tradesman, he is ashamed

            <lb/>the grandest people, as if he belonged to no other.
            <lb/>And now that he can no longer do that, he takes the
            <lb/>disappointment so to heart, that he cannot get the
            <lb/>better of it; and he told me this morning that he
            <lb/>wished he was dead, for he did not know why he

        <p><lb/><q>And has he still no plan, no scheme for his future

        <p><lb/><q>No, madam, none at all; and that it is makes him
            <lb/>so miserable, and being so miserable, makes him so
            <lb/>ill, for <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName> says that with such uneasiness upon
            <lb/>his mind, he can never, in his present low state, get
            <lb/>well.  O it is melancholy to see how he is altered! and
            <lb/>how he has lost all his fine spirits! he that used to be
            <lb/>the life of us all!</q>And now he hardly ever speaks a
            <lb/>word, or if he does, he says something so sorrowful
            <lb/>that it cuts us to the soul!  But yesterday, when my
            <lb/>mother and I thought he was asleep, he lifted up his
            <lb/>head, and looked at us both with the tears in his eyes,
            <lb/>which almost broke our hearts to see, and then, in a
            <lb/>low voice, he said, <q id="YM1">what a lingering illness is this!
                <lb/>Ah, my dear mother, you and poor <persName>Henrietta</persName> ought to
                <lb/>wish it quicker over! for should I recover, my life,
                <lb/>heareafter, will but linger like this illness.</q>  And
            <lb/>afterwards he called out, <q id="YM2">what on earth is to become
                <lb/>of me?  I shall never have health for the army, nor
                <lb/>interest, nor means; what am I to do? subsist in the

            <lb/>out suffering fresh vexation, nad his fever encreases

        <p><lb/><q id="CE186">Well,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, rising, <q id="CE187">I find we shall not
            <lb/>have an easy task to manage him; but keep up your
            <lb/>spirits, and assure yourself he shall not be lost, if it
            <lb/>be possible to save him.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>She then, though with much fearfulness of offending,
            <lb/>once more made an offer of her purse.  <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>
            <lb/>no longer started at the proposal; yet gratefully
            <lb/>thanking her, said she was not in any immediate
            <lb/>distress, and did not dare risk the displeasure of her
            <lb/>brother, unless driven to it by severe necessity.  Ce
            <lb/>cilia, however, drew from her a promise that she
            <lb/>would apply to her in any sudden difficulty, and
            <lb/>charged her never to think herself without a banker
            <lb/>wihile her direction was known to her.</p>
        <p><lb/>She then bid her adieu, and returned home; medi
            <lb/>tating the whole way upon some plan of employment
            <lb/>and advantage for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, which by clearing his
            <lb/>prospects, might revive his spirits, and facilitate his
            <lb/>recovery:  for since his mind was so evidently the seat
            <lb/>of his disease, she saw that unless she could do more
            <lb/>for him, she had yet done nothing.</p>
        <p><lb/>Her meditation, however, turned to no account; she
            <lb/>could suggest nothing, for she was ignorant what
            <lb/>was eligible to suggest.  The stations and employ
            <lb/>ments of men she only knew by occasionally hearing
            <lb/>that such were their professions, and such their
            <lb/>situations in life; but with the means and gradations
            <lb/>by which they arose to them she was wholly unac
            <lb/>quainted.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, her constant resource in all cases
            <lb/>of difficulty, immediately occured to her as her most

            <lb/>able counsellor, and she determined by the first
            <lb/>opportunity to consult with him upon the subject,
            <lb/>certain of advice the most judicious from his expe
            <lb/>rience and knowledge of the world.</p>
        <p><lb/>But though she rested upon him her serious expec
            <lb/>tations of assistance, another idea entered her mind
            <lb/>not less pleasant, though less promising of utility:
            <lb/>this was to mention her views to young <persName>Delvile</persName>.  He
            <lb/>was already, she knew, well informed of the distress
            <lb/>of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, and she hoped, by openly asking his
            <lb/>opinion, to confirm to him her freedom from any
            <lb/>engagement with that gentleman, and convince him,
            <lb/>at the same time, by her application to himself,
            <lb/>that she was equally clear of any tie with the Ba
            <lb/>ronet.</p></div>

        <p><lb/>This accordingly happened; for in the evening

        <p><lb/><q>You are acquainted, I believe, with the distress of

                <lb/>to himself.  Do you think, Sir, this is possible?</q></p>
        <p>	  <lb/><q>How do I rejoice,</q> cried <persName>Delvile</persName>, colouring with
            <lb/>pleasure while he spoke, in this flattering concur
            <lb/>rence of our opinions!  See, madam, taking from his
            <lb/>pocket a letter, <q>how I have been this very morning
                <lb/>occupied, in endeavouring to procure for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>
                <lb/>some employment by which his education might be
                <lb/>rendered useful, and his parts redound to his own cre
                <lb/>dit and advantage.</q></p>
        <p><lb/>He then broke the seal, and put into her hand a
            <lb/>letter to a nobleman, whose son was soon going
            <lb/>abroad, strongly recommending <persName>Belf<sic corr="iel">ile</sic>d</persName> to him in ca
            <lb/>pacity of a tutor.</p>
        <p><lb/>A sympathy of sentiment so striking, impressed
            <lb/>them at the same moment with surprise and esteem:
            <lb/>Delvile earnestly regarded her with eyes of speaking
            <lb/>admiration, while the occasion of his notice rendered
            <lb/>it too pleasant to distress her, and filled her with an
            <lb/>inward satisfaction which brightened her whole coun
            <lb/>tenance.</p>
        <p><lb/>She had only time, in a manner that strongly marked
            <lb/>her approbation, to return the letter, before <persName>Mrs.
                <lb/>Delvile</persName> again made her appearance.</p>
        <p><lb/>During the rest of the evening but little was said;
            <lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName> was not talkative, and young <persName>Delvile</persName> was so
            <lb/>absent, that three times his mother reminded him of
            <lb/>an engagement to meet his father, who that night was
            <lb/>expected at the Duke of <placeName>Derwent's</placeName> house in town,
            <lb/>before he heard that she spoke to him, and three times
            <lb/>more before, when he had heard, he obeyed.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Cecilia</persName>, when she came back to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s, found
            <lb/>the house full of company.  She went into the draw
            <pb n="332"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2S4v"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">328</mw>
            <lb/>ing-room, but did not remain there long; she was
            <lb/>grave and thoughtful, she wished to be alone, and by
            <lb/>the earliest opportunity stole away to her own apart
            <lb/>ment.</p>
        <p><lb/>Her mind was now occupied by new ideas, and her
            <lb/>fancy was busied in the delineation of new prospects.
            <lb/>She had been struck from her first meeting young
            <lb/>Delvile with an involuntary admiration of his man
            <lb/>ners and conversation; she had found upon every
            <lb/>succeeding interview something further to approve,
            <lb/>and felt for him a rising partiality which made her
            <lb/>always see him with pleasure, and never part from
            <lb/>him without a wish to see him again.  Yet, as she
            <lb/>was not of that inflammable nature which is always
            <lb/>ready to take fire, as her passions were under the con
            <lb/>troul of her reason, and she suffered not her affections
            <lb/>to triumph over her principles, she started at her
            <lb/>danger the moment she perceived it, and instantly de
            <lb/>termined to give no weak encouragement to a prepos
            <lb/>session which neither time nor intimacy had justified.
            <lb/>She denied herself the deluding satisfaction of dwel
            <lb/>ling upon the supposition of his worth, was unusually
            <lb/>assiduous to occupy all her time, that her heart might
            <lb/>have less leisure for imagination; and had she found
            <lb/>that his character degenerated from the promise of his
            <lb/>appearance, the well-regulated purity of her mind
            <lb/>would soon have enabled to have driven him wholly
            <lb/>from her thoughts.</p>
        <p><lb/>Such was her situation when the circumstances of
            <lb/>her affairs occasioned her becoming an inmate of his
            <lb/>house; and here she grew less guarded, because less
            <lb/>clear-sighted to the danger of negligence, for the
            <lb/>frequency of their conversations allowed her little
            <pb n="333"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2T1r"/>
            <mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">329</mw>
            <lb/>time to consider their effects.  If at first she had
            <lb/>been pleased with his deportment and elegance,
            <lb/>upon intimacy she was charmed with his disposition
            <lb/>and his behaviour; she found him manly, generous,
            <lb/>open-hearted, and amiable, fond of literature, de
            <lb/>lighting in knowledge, kind in his temper, and spirited
            <lb/>in his actions.</p>
        <p><lb/>Qualities such as these, when recommended by high
            <lb/>birth, a striking figure, and polished manners, formed
            <lb/>but a dangerous companion for a young woman, who,
            <lb/>without the guard of any former prepossession, was so
            <lb/>fervent an admirer of excellence as <persName>Cecilia</persName>.  Her
            <lb/>heart made no resistance, for the attack was too gentle
            <lb/>and too gradual to alarm her vigilance, and therefore,
            <lb/>though always sensible of the pleasure she received
            <lb/>from his society, it was not till she returned to <placeName>Port
                <lb/>man-Square</placeName>, after having lived under the same roof
            <lb/>with him for a fortnight, that she was conscious her
            <lb/>happiness was no longer in her own power.</p>
        <p><lb/><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s house, which had never pleased her,
            <lb/>now became utterly disgustful; she was wearied and
            <lb/>uncomfortable; yet, willing to attribute her uneasi
            <lb/>ness to any other than the true cause, she fancied the
            <lb/>house itself was changed, and that all its inhabitants
            <lb/>and visitors were more than usually disagreeable:
            <lb/>but this idle error was of short duration, the moment
            <lb/>of self-conviction was at hand, and when <persName>Delvile</persName> pre
            <lb/>sented her the letter he had written for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
            <lb/>it flashed in her eyes!</p>
        <p><lb/>This detection of the altered state of her mind,
            <lb/>opened to her views and her hopes a scene entirely
            <lb/>new, for neither the exertion of the most active bene
            <lb/>volence, nor the steady course of the most virtuous
            <mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">No.14.</mw>

            <lb/>conduct, sufficed any longer to wholly engage her
            <lb/>thoughts, or constitute her felicity; she had purposes
            <lb/>that came nearer home, and cares that threatened to
            <lb/>absorb in themselves that heart and those faculties
            <lb/>which hitherto had only seemed animated for the ser
            <lb/>vice of others.</p>
        <p><lb/>Yet this loss of mental freedom gave her not
            <lb/>much uneasiness, since the choice of her heart, though
            <lb/>involuntary, was approved by her principles, and con
            <lb/>firmed by her judgment.  Young <persName>Delvile's</persName> situation
            <lb/>in life was just what she wished, more elevated than
            <lb/>her own, yet not so exalted as to humble her with a
            <lb/>sense of inferiority; his connections were honourable,
            <lb/>his mother appeared to her the first of women, his cha
            <lb/>racter and disposition seemed formed to make her
            <lb/>happy, and her own fortune was so large, that to the
            <lb/>state of his she was indifferent.</p>
        <p><lb/>Delighted with so flattering a union of inclination
            <lb/>with propriety, she now began to cherish the partiality
            <lb/>she at first repressed, and thinking the future destina
            <lb/>tion of her life already settled, looked forward with
            <lb/>grateful joy to the prospect of ending her days with
            <lb/>the man she thought most worthy to be entrusted with
            <lb/>the disposal of her fortune.</p>
        <p><lb/>She had not, indeed, any certainty that the regard
            <lb/>of young <persName>Delvile</persName> was reciprocal, but she had every
            <lb/>reason to believe he greatly admired her, and to sus
            <lb/>pect that his mistaken notion of her prior engage
            <lb/>ment, first with <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, and afterwards with <persName>Sir
                <lb/>Robert Floyer</persName>, made him at present check those sen
            <lb/>timents in her favour which, when that error was re
            <lb/>moved, she hoped to see encouraged.</p>
        <p><lb/>Her purpose, therefore, was quietly to wait an ex
            <pb n="335"/>
            <milestone unit="sig" n="2T2r"/>

            <lb/>planation, which she rather wished retarded than for
            <lb/>warded, that her leisure and opportunity might be
            <lb/>more for investigating his character, and saving her
            <lb/>self from repentance.</p></div>
