(author abstract)2002,allen  patrick  bateman  john  delin  judy.,a model of genre in document layout,we present a framework for describing the genres of illustrated documents  based on analysis at five levels  content structure  rhetorical structure  layout structure  navigation structure  and linguistic structure. we also include three sources of constraints under which a document might be produced and interpreted  canvas constraints  production constraints  and consumption constraints. document genres are conceptualised as complex specifications composed of descriptions at each of the five levels that conform in characteristic ways to the three kinds of constraint. we propose that the eight parameters together form a space of possible identities for documents  electronic or paper. the notion of genre space captures the fact that it is possible for new genres to develop at different positions in the space  as well enabling relationships between document types  or even transformations between them  to be examined and described.

corporate annual reports. 79 per cent of companies used graphs and 64 per cent of all graphs were bar column graphs. many of these were poorly designed and constructed. there was evidence of biasing in graphic choices with the use of graphic presentation being contingent upon good rather than bad financial performance. companies were 3 time more likely to include graphs in their annual report which exaggerated  rather than understated  favourable time series trends in key performance variables. there was also evidence of the use of certain design and construction techniques intended to create a favourable visual impression. there is a need for more studies of graphic practices in other domains and for guidelines to raise the standards and fidelity of financial graphs. original

different fonts were created  each containing several variations of the most frequently misrecognized letters. these variations were tested both with distance and short exposure methodologies. creating variations within a typeface avoided confounds that occur when letters from different typefaces are compared against each other. the studies found that some variations were more legible than others despite the letters within a font having similar size  weight  and personality. the results showed that narrow letters benefit from being widened  and that x-height characters benefit from using more of the ascending and descending area. these findings can be used to improve the design of future typefaces. adapted from the source document2010,beier  sofie  larson  kevin.,design

(author abstract)2004,boswood  timothy  carliner  saul.,genre  a useful construct for researching online communication for the workplace,this paper presents a case for a genre-based approach to research into online communication. questions about the appropriateness and extensiveness of research-based guidelines for communicating online exist. these questions include the appropriateness of transferring guidelines from research on print communication online without first re-verifying them  the appropriateness of generalizing conclusions from context-based  small sample-sized usability studies  the extent of generalizability of empirical studies  and the limited scope of guidelines that focus almost exclusively on physical features of text. genre - a familiar pattern  a way of organizing information that has become so common that readers will probably recognize each new instance as belonging to the genre (price & price  2002  272) - provides an alternative  contextually-based approach. it is a useful context because most online communication occurs within the confines of a specific genre and  as genres become more common  users develop expectations about the type of content presented and the format of its presentation. three methods can help researchers understand the nature of online genres  (1) discourse analysis helps researchers identify the features of a genre  (2) usability studies help researchers assess whether the features promote effective user performance (and  if so  how)  and (3) design team research identifies why features were included and which other alternatives were considered  rejected  and why. an effective study of genre uses all three. focusing on genre  too  allows researchers within sub-disciplines of communication to focus their work on their areas of specialty.

(author abstract)2011,britt  m anne  rouet  jean-francois.,research challenges in the use of multiple documents,research on text comprehension has looked at a wide range of texts and reading contexts  but has largely focused on how students comprehend simple narrative or expository passages under general task directions such as general comprehension. over the past decade  however  more and more researchers have recognized the importance of extending the construct of text comprehension to include broader contexts of activities. this article argues that the consideration of functional reading goals and reading across texts presents some new and important challenges for research. it explains how a broadened research perspective will make text comprehension research more relevant and drive innovations in the domain of text design as well as the teaching of text-related skills. after discussing research challenges in the use of multiple documents  the article describes the multiple-document task-based relevance assessment and content extraction (md-trace) model which identifies dimensions of both external and internal resources that may affect the way information is processed by readers. adapted from the source document.1990,brugger  christof.,advances in the international standardization of public information symbols,christof brugger of the international standards organisation reports on recent developments in the standardization of public information symbols (pictograms).2009,burke  christopher.,isotype  representing social facts pictorially.,in developing isotype (international system of typographic picture education)   otto neurath and his colleagues were the first to systematically explore a consistent visual language as part of an encyclopedic approach to representing all aspects of the physical world. the pictograms used in isotype have a secure legacy in today s public information symbols  but isotype was more than this  it was designed to communicate social facts memorably to less educated groups  including schoolchildren and workers  reflecting its initial testing ground in the socialist municipality of vienna during the 1920s. the social engagement and methodology of isotype are examined here in order to draw some lessons for information design today.

out any action. this interpretation entails transforming pictorial & or linguistic information into a series of actions. current psychological models propose that these two kinds of information are not processed in the same way  & that pictures lead more directly to the construction of a mental representation than does text. if this is so  then giving pictorial instructions to carry out an action seems more appropriate than giving text. however  processing instructions sometimes fails  even with picture formats. one approach to studying why this kind of communication fails is to investigate how textual & pictorial information is processed. 3 tables  5 figures  17 references. adapted from the source document1993,garland  k.,lead  kindly light  a user s view of the design and

research-in-progress note discusses the initial stages of an ongoing project investigating how university students new to the world of document design make inventive decisions and critical judgments as they design complex documents. in the context of this project  complex documents are those that depend for their full rhetorical impact not only on a textual component  but also on pictorial and navigational components. pictorial here refers to any visible feature of the document  from photographs and illustrations to layout and typography  and navigational refers to any feature specifically designed to aid the reader s comprehension and experience of the document s structure  from page numbers to tables-of-contents to dynamic hyperlinks. though we might say that any artifact called a document contains all three of these components to some degree (even a visually bland  text-heavy manuscript will contain at least some kind of pictorial and navigational features)  the research project discussed here focuses on the sort of documents built by authors who must attend to all three simultaneously and intensively - that is  by authors who play the roles of writer  graphic designer  and information architect  all at once.

(author abstract)2004,gunnarsson  britt-louise.,the multilayered structure of enterprise discourse,this article explores the complex relationship between enterprise & discourse from a sociolinguistic viewpoint. a model of communication is presented which depicts the multilayered framework of texts within organizations. with this model as a background  results from two studies on enterprise discourse are discussed. the fist study analyzed communication within banks & structural engineering companies in sweden  germany  & great britain. interviews were held with staff at different levels  & written documents were analyzed. though of course the discourse within the studied companies had much in common  differences were found as well  which can be explained by variation in sector  the organizational culture  & the national culture. the second study focused on the multilingual production of texts in a swedish based international company. an analysis of company brochures produced in different european branches showed considerable variation in relation to content  arguments  & style. though the headquarters steered the sales companies by means of a common text base  the various brochures also revealed differences that reflected ideas from the local level. both studies thus show how the creation of uniqueness & attractiveness  on the one hand  takes place within the limits set by the sector concerned &  on the other  is determined by the relevant national culture(s). the company is part of a wider sectoral network that frequently has well-established discourse traditions. moreover  a company also operates within a national culture  or several cultures  forcing it to adapt to national discourse patterns as well. 2 tables  2 figures  17 references. adapted from the source document2004,gurr  corin.,a short note of computational diagrammatics,summary of a contribution to the symposia  2by2  (held in the usa in 2003) in which the author looks at the nature of diagrammatic language  identifying the inexpressive nature of graphs and nodes which become overloaded with symbology and confused textual annotations. the author analogously looks to theories of natural lanuages  and cites computational diagrammatics as a means of facilitating readability. includes a biography of the author.2008,hakemulder  frank.,literary potential  the unexplored powers of reading,reading literature strongly differs from other modes of communication. its specific qualities are assumed to have effects that are not only relevant to the individual readers sitting at home in their comfortable reading chairs  but also in many other communicative situations. these situations typically do not allow for persuasive messages  but require self-reflection and an understanding of other people s thoughts and emotions. because very little is known about such effects  this article argues that one important challenge of research is to come to true interdisciplinary projects to fully understand the fundamental processes underlying the potential effects of literary texts. adapted from the source document.2000,harper  r h r.,getting to grips with information  using sociological case materials to aid the design of document technologies,interaction modalities with document technologies have been quite limited. current advances have led to the emergence of a host of new techniques for navigation  marking and annotation  and these are allowing users of documents to get to grips with documents more effectively than before. illustrates how sociological investigations can provide insights into what these new interaction modalities might be.

first conference of the expert forum for knowledge presentation  held in chicago  illinois  30-31 may  2003. the symposium attracted information designers  scholars and professionals involved in the production and communication of knowledge from many disciplines  including information design  interface design  design collaboration  finance  education  social sciences  and cognitive science. the keynote speaker was professor n. mackinnon (guelph university). the summaries in this issue reflect the range of topics addressed. a complete set of abstracts can be found at www.knowledgepresentation.org.2001,kazmierczak  elzbieta t.,a semiotic perspective on aesthetic preferences  visual literacy  and information design,discusses the image-making process as a process of visual modelling of concepts. the author considers different semiotic functions of graphic forms  notes the lack of semantic dimension when pictorial representations are discsussed  and suggests the importance of cultural conditions in defining responses to graphic conventions. she describes visual organisation convention in relation to perceptual expectation and visual literacy  examines the image-making process using a syntactic model  and explores notions of pictorial memory with reference to the writing of aristotle. she traces the history of the didactic image  and exaplains why the use of visual models can enhance comprehension.2001,kazmierczak  elzbieta t.,a semiotic perspective on aesthetic preferences  visual literacy  and information design,discusses the image-making

redesign project. in a collaborative effort  a linguist  a graphic designer and an executive manager developed and tested new telephone bill solutions to improve customer comprehension and satisfaction with a very familiar yet complex document. the project resulted in an improved document for the telephone company while raising important questions for future research into the nature of how people interact with routine documents in terms of preference  comprehension and use.1986,kerr  stephen t.,learning to use electronic text  an agenda for research in typography  graphics  and interpanel navigation,examines ways in which electronic texts could be developed to cope both with the rapid growth in the use of electronic information systems  and also with the needs of `non-sophisticated  users of such systems  particularly children. the author argues that there are three areas which need to be researched  1) screen design and typography (in particular text density and space  and the perceptions of younger users)  2) graphics (and how they interact with text)  3) `interpanel navigation  (how the purpose of a search interacts with the type of help provided). the greater use of electronic text systems  he concludes  requires the bringing together of human factors research and research in developmental and learning psychology.2002,kesseler  ernst  knapen  ed.,designing future advanced controller displays,this paper describes the design of an advanced human-machine interface for well-trained  professional users  i.e. air traffic controllers. the safety implications of their tasks  combined with the short reaction time available to the user  result in high demands on the interface between the human and the supporting information system. the increasing demand for air traffic capacity (which can not be accommodated by just deploying more personnel as the additional co-ordination offsets the workload reduction) necessitates the introduction of innovative support tools to prevent human overload. experience with the introduction of such tools stresses the need to design their user interfaces using a human-centred approach  contrasting with the traditional technology-centred approach.

teacher,the typographer anthony froshaug worked as a teacher in britain and germany  from the late 40s - 80s. he was unusual in bringing the experience of typesetting and printing to design teaching  and in his wide set of intellectual interests. his contribution was a notable if somewhat subterranean element in the development of education in typography in britain  especially in the steps towards its modernization that were made in the 60s and 70s. original abstract-amended.1984,kinross  robin  ruder  emil.,emil ruder s typography and `swiss typography ,the author discusses the revision of emil ruder s typography  a manual of design (first published in 1967) into a purely english paperback edition (new york  hastings house  london  designer publications  1981  see abm 14 3850 for abstract). he discusses the limitations of the book that is advertised as a `coherent program   explains ruder s relationship to modernism and argues that the book is representative of the larger phenomenon of swiss typography. he enlarges on this latter point and discusses the use of sanserif typefaces and the concept of a grid.1986,kinross  robin.,marie neurath 1898-1986,a tribute to the german-born graphic and information designer marie neurath who died in 1986.2005,kinross  robin.,the claim of reason  a twenty-five year argument about information design,an article giving the views of information designer robin kinross (b.1949) on the on-going theoretical debate within the information design field. the article comments on a lecture by david sless at schwarzenberg  austria  (1996) referring to three paradigms of information design  formalism - the designer as central  information transmission - emphasising the user  constructionism - the social realm as the focus. kinross also gives his perspective on james  hartley s book  designing instructional text  (1978)  the semantics of noam chomsky and on a relativism tempered by reasoning.1993,kinross

contemporary issues in typography  with particular reference to his work for the berlin transport system  bvg. spiekerman outlines his belief in the importance of design in everyday circumstances and describes his typographical methods for public sign-boards  noting the restrictions on public expenditure due to the present economic and political climate in germany. contrasting readability with legibility  he discerns a trend towards ideography in graphic design and expresses regret at the lack of typographic critics. in conclusion he states that design should be discussed and not described

and the royal college of art in london  the hochschule fur gestaltung in ulm  germany and other institutions.1986,kinross  robin.,semiotics and designing,examines whether semiotics has a rÃ´le to play in the theory or practice of graphic design. the author argues that semiotics  unlike information theory  has the advantage of recognizing the semantic dimension of design. however  being based on a saussurian model of language  which emphasizes the synchronic structures of meaning  remote from history and everyday discourse  semiotics is incompatible with the essentially material and practical nature of designing. the author also examines proposals for a visual verbal `rhetoric  (classical rhetoric modified by semiotics) which aims to link theory and practice and recognizes the social dimension of design. here too  though acknowledging the value of such an approach in teaching  the author argues that there is much in design which such theories cannot discuss.1993,kinross  robin.,paul mijksenaar  a conversation and a lecture,in interview dutch graphic designer paul mijksenaar discusses the design of public information material. he considers the value of research in the area and of the practical testing of informational data. mijksenaar examines the need to combine aesthetic and functional considerations with reference to a project to design a new corporate identity for the dutch post office. the second part of the article is a summary of mijksenaar s inaugural lecture at the faculty of industrial design at the technische universiteit delft (20 jan. 1993) in which he explores the scope of industrial design. examples of design failures and the issue of form and function are also considered.1993,kinross  robin.,paul mijksenaar  a conversation and

networks.,human behavior regarding transport depends on travel time estimation and not on measured travel times. travel time is dependent on human body energy consumption for different activities  which has been studied by the author over the last 30 years. uncertainty can enhance time perception up to a factor of 5 compared to measured time  dependent on the certainty or uncertainty of the information system. quantitative analysis has shown that information improvements at interchanges of transport systems can have a value equal to or even greater than time saving produced by expensive  huge infrastructure projects. the paper will present empirical results from studies over the last 40 years and the theoretical background.

(original abstract)1995,lang  t.,the contradictions of food labelling policy,contribution to a special section dealing with food labelling policy. reviews food labelling issues. some of these issues are reflected in food labels and others are not. there is little consistency of approach to labelling  and there are grounds for questioning whether food labelling is working to the benefit of consumers. market theory requires consumers to be fully information for the market to work. but theory and reality are ill matched because food labelling has itself become a battleground  rather than a tool to enable the market to work. market theory either needs to be applied or to be changed. food labelling is not the answer to getting better food  better food production  or even better flows of information. at best  the struggle for more honest labelling can be an educational process in itself.2007,le pair  rob  jansen  carel  korzilius  hubert  van gerdingen  jolanda  de graaf  susanne  et al.,information mapping  effects of text features and reader characteristics on performance and appreciation,in a previous study  no effects were found applying information mapping (imap) to a relatively short text. in three new experiments  we investigated whether text length and the presence or absence of typical imap format features would influence possible imap effects  and if there would be any interaction effects of the application of the imap method and reader characteristics. it turned out that when presented with a relatively long text  readers worked more effectively and efficiently with an imap version. adding typical imap format features to an otherwise unaltered conventional text did not produce greater effectiveness but did result in greater efficiency and higher appreciation. no interaction effects were found of the respondents  linguistic background and the application of the imap method.

(author abstract)2004,spence  robert.,sensitivity  residue and scent. concepts to inform interaction design for the support of information space navigation,navigation through an information space that is often unknown  unstructured and extensive can be challenging  especially when the target is not fully formulated and exploration of the space is deemed to be beneficial. the design of an information space requires the provision of effective navigational cues to indicate to users what information the space contains and how to get to that information. we suggest  and demonstrate by means of examples that the concepts of sensitivity  residue and scent can inform the design of such navigational cues. in order to show the wide application of these concepts we identify their potential to facilitate navigation in three very different contexts. one is the traditional information space in which information is explicitly available to users. a second comprises information spaces in which sensitivity information can be computed  and is especially relevant to interactive design (e.g.  engineering or financial) and decision-making. more speculatively  we suggest that the concepts of sensitivity  residue and scent may be of value in socially defined contexts in which navigational cues arise from the collective or individual behaviour of other users.
