PURPOSE: Colistin is increasingly used as the last-resort treatment option against infections caused by multidrug-resistant  MDR  Gram-negative pathogens  but its nephrotoxicity is of concern  especially in severely ill patients  The aim of this study was to analyze the toxicity of colistin therapy in adults and children with hematological malignancies  HM  and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  recipients  METHODS: Data on HSCT recipients and HM patients  treated with intravenous colistin  2 5-5ÿmg kg day in children and 3-6 million international units  IU  in adults  adjusted to renal function  during the period 2008-2011 in our center  were retrospectively collected and analyzed  Nephrotoxicity was defined according to the RIFLE criteria  Risk  Injury  Failure  Loss  and End-stage kidney disease   RESULTS: Twenty-nine children and adults received 38 courses of intravenous colistin  2 5-5ÿmg kg day in children and 3-6ÿ?ÿ10 6 ÿIU in adults  adjusted to renal function  [allogeneic HSCT  22 courses  and HM  16 courses ] for 3-28 days  median 10 days  for empirical therapy for nosocomial clinical sepsis  28  or local infection  6   and bacteremia with MDR Gram-negative rods  4   Nephrotoxicity was observed at the end of 4  10 5ÿ   courses  In 32  84ÿ   courses  nephrotoxic medications were concomitantly administered  Two patients had convulsions  probably unrelated to colistin  Seven patients  18ÿ   died while on colistin therapy  No death was attributed to an adverse effect of colistin  CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with intravenous colistin  with dosage adjusted to renal function  was relatively safe for HM HSCT patients  even with concomitantly administered nephrotoxic medications  Concern about nephrotoxicity should not justify a delay in initiating empirical colistin treatment in situations where infection with MDR Gram-negative rods is likely ,
We analyzed outcome of a population-based cohort of 74 children with second and third acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  relapse and aimed to identify prognostic factors  Duration of previous remission and site of relapse appeared of prognostic relevance as patients with a second remission duration  1 5 years and isolated extramedullary relapse did better  Neither patient with a second bone marrow relapse who underwent previous allogeneic transplantation nor patients with T-cell ALL survived  Overall  7 of 74  9   patients are in long-term remission  Stem cell transplantation seemed to be the only curative option for systemic relapse of B-cell precursor ALL as all 4 surviving patients with a second third relapse involving the bone marrow received a transplant  Conclusively  patients with a second ALL relapse are ideal candidates for phase I II trials exploring new innovative drugs ,
Although macrophage activation syndrome  MAS  develops in some patients with chronic granulomatous disease  CGD   all of the reported cases have been associated with pathogenic microbial infections  We report a 2-year-old boy with CGD-associated colitis who suffered from MAS without any clinical signs of a microbial infection  He was treated with 1 course of methylprednisolone pulse therapy and the clinical symptoms improved; however  the colitis was difficult to control even with immunosuppressive drugs  and he eventually required hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 1 year after the onset of MAS  It is likely that MAS develops in patients with CGD colitis independent of microbial infections ,
Natural killer  NK  T-cell lymphomas and NK-cell leukemias are aggressive malignancies  Occurring worldwide  they show a predilection for Asian and South American populations  Neoplastic cells are surface-CD3-  cytoplasmic-CD3 +  CD56+  cytotoxic molecules+  Epstein-Barr virus  EBV +  with germline T-cell receptor gene  Lymphomas occur most commonly in the nasal and upper aerodigestive region  Occasional cases present primarily in the skin  salivary gland  testis and gastrointestinal tract  Rare cases are disseminated with lymphadenopathy  hepatosplenomegaly and a leukemic phase  Positron emission tomography computed tomography is useful in staging  as lymphomas are 18-fluorodeoxyglucose-avid  Quantification of circulating EBV DNA is an accurate surrogate biomarker of tumor load  Nasal NK T-cell lymphomas present mostly with stage I II disease  Concomitant sequential chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the standard treatment  Radiotherapy alone is inadequate because of high systemic failure rate  For stage III IV nasal  non-nasal and disseminated lymphomas  systemic chemotherapy is indicated  Regimens containing L-asparaginase and drugs unaffected by P-glycoprotein are most effective  Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  is not indicated for early-staged nasal lymphomas  HSCT for lymphomas not in remission has poor results  In advanced-staged nasal  non-nasal  disseminated or relapsed lymphomas  HSCT may be considered when remission is achieved  Prognostic modeling and EBV DNA monitoring may be useful in risk-stratification for HSCT ,
Steroid refractory gastrointestinal  GI  acute graft versus host disease  aGVHD  is a major cause of mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HCT  without immune markers to establish a diagnosis or guide therapy  We found that T cell receptor    TCR   CDR3 repertoire sequencing reveals patterns that could eventually serve as a disease biomarker of T cell alloreactivity in aGVHD  We identified T cell clones in GI biopsies in a heterogeneous group of 15 allogeneic HCT patients with GI aGVHD symptoms  Seven steroid-refractory aGVHD patients showed a more conserved TCR  clonal structure between different biopsy sites in the GI tract than eight primary-therapy responsive patients  Tracking GI clones identified at endoscopy longitudinally in the blood also revealed an increased clonal expansion in patients with steroid-refractory disease  Immune repertoire sequencing-based methods could enable a novel personalized way to guide diagnosis and therapy in diseases where T cell activity is a major determinant ,
Stem cell-based treatment may represent a hope for the treatment of acute lung injury and pulmonary fibrosis  and other chronic lung diseases  such as cystic fibrosis  asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  COPD   It is well established in preclinical models that bone marrow-derived stem and progenitor cells exert beneficial effects on inflammation  immune responses and repairing of damage in virtually all lung-borne diseases  While it was initially thought that the positive outcome was due to a direct engraftment of these cells into the lung as endothelial and epithelial cells  paracrine factors are now considered the main mechanism through which stem and progenitor cells exert their therapeutic effect  This knowledge has led to the clinical use of marrow cells in pulmonary hypertension with endothelial progenitor cells  EPCs  and in COPD with mesenchymal stromal  stem  cells  MSCs   Bone marrow-derived stem cells  including hematopoietic stem progenitor cells  MSCs  EPCs and fibrocytes  encompass a wide array of cell subsets with different capacities of engraftment and injured tissue-regenerating potential  The characterization isolation of the stem cell subpopulations represents a major challenge to improve the efficacy of transplantation protocols used in regenerative medicine and applied to lung disorders ,
Cerebral abscess caused by Candida spp  is a rare disease  with a nonspecific presentation  little data on treatment  and generally poor outcomes  We present a case of this type of Candida infection in a 57-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and intravenous drug abuse  and review the literature on this disease  Our patient had a good treatment outcome with liposomal amphotericin B and flucytosine  followed by oral fluconazole  Comorbidities include prior antibiotic use  52    prior surgery  28    malignancy  28    stem cell or solid organ transplant  20    prior corticosteroid use  16    central venous catheter  CVC  insertion  10    and burns  7    Diagnosis requires a high index of suspicion  as clinical presentations and laboratory data can be nonspecific and difficult to differentiate from bacterial cerebral abscesses  In reviewed cases  55  of blood cultures and 23  of cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  cultures were positive for Candida spp  and outcomes were poor  as the mortality rate of the non-autopsy cases reviewed was 69  ,
BACKGROUND: Reports of responses and toxicities of salvage therapies for relapsed neuroblastoma are rare and often confounded by effects of additional treatments  Our objective was to describe the outcomes and toxicities for a topotecan and cyclophosphamide  TOPO CTX  regimen for first relapse or progression of high-risk neuroblastoma  METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed charts of relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma patients treated between 1999 and 2009 with our standard-of-care outpatient TOPO CTX  0 75 and 250 mg m 2   day ? 5 days q3-4 weeks   RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients received 343 cycles of TOPO CTX  median 10 cycles per patient  range 1-32   Most patients  N = 25  had undergone autologous stem cell transplantation  Seventeen  63   patients had an objective response  CR + PR + MR   The 3-year progression-free survival  PFS  after relapse was 11 ñ 6  and 3-year overall survival  OS  after relapse was 33 ñ 9   The median PFS was 1 2 years and the median OS was 2 3 years  Five patients are alive with follow-up of 3 1-5 5 years  Shorter time from diagnosis to relapse  6-18 months  was associated with shorter OS  The majority of patients experienced chemotherapy delays  transfusions  and febrile neutropenia  including eight bacterial infections  The mean number of hospitalized days was less than one per cycle  CONCLUSIONS: TOPO CTX was well tolerated and resulted in response rates and PFS similar to those reported for patients treated on COG 9462  Our study provides additional toxicity  historical endpoints  and time-to-progression data against which new agents and combination therapies using TOPO CTX as a backbone can be measured  Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013;9999:XX-XX  ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
Cytomegalovirus  CMV  can precipitate and exacerbate gastrointestinal  GI  mucosal injury  The gold standard for CMV detection in formalin-fixed  paraffin-embedded  FFPE  tissue is immunohistochemistry  IHC   Although CMV polymerase chain reaction  PCR  on fresh tissue may be a valuable adjunct to IHC  its utility is unknown for FFPE tissues  We therefore evaluated quantitative  real-time CMV PCR in a total of 102 FFPE GI biopsy specimens from 74 patients with a history of hematopoietic stem cell or solid organ transplant  inflammatory bowel disease  human immunodeficiency virus infection  or unspecified colitis  CMV DNA was detected by PCR in 90 9   30 33  of IHC-positive  14 5   8 55  of IHC-negative  and 20 0   1 5  of IHC-equivocal FFPE tissues  Quantitation of CMV DNA copies normalized to  -globin demonstrated a wide range of values  median 0 276; range  0 0004 to 144 50   Importantly  93 3   14 15  of patients with IHC-positive  active colitis showed no evidence of CMV in matched concurrent  histologically normal biopsies tested by PCR  These results suggest that CMV PCR on FFPE GI biopsies complements IHC and has the potential to identify additional patients who may benefit from anti-CMV therapy ,
This is a phase I study to determine the maximal tolerated dose  MTD  of CPX-351 when administered sequentially with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  in patients with refractory acute leukemia  CPX-351 is a novel liposomal formulation  which combines cytosine arabinoside  ara-c  and daunorubicin in a fixed  molar ratio of 5:1  Patients in cohorts of 3 were treated with CPX-351 followed by fludarabine and busulfan  Bu Flu  conditioning at 4  schedule A  or 3 weeks  Schedule B  intervals  CPX-351 doses were escalated in 20 units m 2  increments starting at 60 units m 2  x 3 doses  Thirty-six patients were enrolled  29 patients were able to undergo HSCT and 7 patients did not proceed to transplantation  primarily on schedule A  due to rapid disease progression  The MTD of CPX-351 was not reached at the 120 units m 2  x 3 dose level  All 29 patients who proceeded to transplant had adequate neutrophil and platelet engraftment  The median follow-up time on the study for all 36 patients was 205 days  range: 20-996 days   The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse and non-relapse mortality  NRM  for the 36 patients  were 60 1   95  CI = 43 4   77 3   and 23 8   95  CI = 10 9   47 4   respectively  The 1-year overall survival  OS  and leukemia free survival  LFS  were 37   95  CI = 21 -53   and 27   95  CI = 13 -43   respectively  A phase II trial should incorporate CPX-351 120 units m 2  x 3 on schedule B  Patients with good performance status and those who achieve effective cytoreduction from CPX-351 derived the most benefit ,
BACKGROUND: T-ALL relapsing after allogeneic stem cell transplantation is unusual but classically associated with poor outcome  Recently  encouraging results have been reported with Nelarabine in relapse or refractory cases  MATERIALS AND METHODS: On behalf of the Group of Research in Adult ALL  GRAALL   we conducted a retrospective analysis of patients receiving Nelarabine following relapse after transplantation  RESULTS: Eleven patients received Nelarabine as salvage therapy in this situation  Most of them were transplanted in first Complete Remission  CR   and received a myeloablative conditioning regimen in 7 cases  Relapse occurred with a median time of 199 days  Nelarabine was given at 1 5g mý day  Day1  D3  D5  alone  N=5  or in association  N=6   The overall hematological response rate was 81   Neurologic toxicity represents the main adverse event  N=4   mainly grade I-II  Event free survival and overall survival at 1 year were 70 and 90  respectively  CONCLUSION: Nelarabine is a valuable option for salvage therapy in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia relapsing after transplantation ,
Class 3 thalassemia patients with high risk features for adverse events after high-dose chemotherapy with Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  are difficult to treat  they either suffer serious toxicity or fail to establish a stable graft function  We transplanted 18 such patients with an age   7 years and hepatomegaly utilizing a novel approach with pharmacologic immunoablation followed by a myeloablative  reduced toxicity conditioning regimen  Fludarabine-IV Busulfan;  Flu-IV Bu   and HSCT  Median age was 14 years  range 10-18   Prior to the Flu-IV Bu+ATG conditioning regimen  all patients received one to two cycles of immunosuppressive pharmacotherapy with Flu and dexamethasone  Dex   Thirteen patients received related- and 5 unrelated donor-grafts  An initial prompt engraftment of donor cells with full donor chimerism was observed in all 18 patients but 2 patients developed secondary mixed chimerism that necessitated withdrawal of immunosuppression to achieve full donor chimerism  Two patients  11   had acute grade III-IV GvHD and 5 patients had limited chronic GvHD  The only treatment-related mortality was from infection  and with a median follow-up of 42 months  range  4-75   the 5-year of overall and thalassemia free survival are 89   We conclude that this novel sequential immunoablative pretransplant conditioning program proved safe and effective for high risk Class 3 thalassemia patients exhibiting additional co-morbidities ,
Despite the availability of new antifungal compounds  invasive fungal disease is associated with a high mortality in hematopoietic stem cell transplant  HSCT  recipients  A growing body of evidence suggests that T lymphocytes from the T-helper type 1  TH 1  play an important role in the antifungal host defense  and preliminary data indicate a potential benefit of infusing donor-derived antifungal TH 1 cells to HSCT patients suffering from invasive fungal disease  Unfortunately  it is unclear to date whether the function of these cells is affected by concomitantly administered antifungal agents  We therefore analyzed the effects of various concentrations of commonly used antifungal compounds such as amphotericin B  caspofungin  fluconazole  voriconazole  and posaconazole on the functional properties of cultivated human antifungal TH 1 cells  None of the antifungal compounds tested significantly influenced the secretion of interferon-  and tumor necrosis factor-   and only posaconazole at high concentrations slightly decreased proliferation of antifungal TH 1 cells  Our data indicate that the antifungal agents tested do not significantly affect the functional properties of antifungal TH 1 cells and can therefore be concomitantly administered ,
Ito and Barrett recently reviewed the international experiences with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  allo-HSCT  for the treatment of the neuronopathic and non-neuronopathic forms of Gaucher disease  GD   In the present communication  the author adds some updated data on the long-term outcome of allo-HSCT for Swedish GD patients with the mean and median follow-up time of 27ÿyears  the longest follow-up of 30ÿyears  and makes comments on some of the authors  statements found in the article ,
Bronchiolitis obliterans  BO  is a complication after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT   BO-management comprises intensive immunosuppression  but treatment response is poor  We investigated the effect of cyclosporine A  CsA   tacrolimus  FK506   methylprednisolone  mPRED   mycophenolate mofetil  MMF   and everolimus on the proliferation of primary lung myofibroblasts from HSCT-patients with bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome  BOS  Methods: Cells were isolated from surgical lung biopsies of 8 HSCT-patients with BOS  Proliferation was assessed by [ 3 H]-thymidine-incorporation Results: Biopsies revealed constrictive BO in 3 and lymphocytic bronchiolitis  LB  in 5 patients  CsA and FK506 significantly induced proliferation of myofibroblasts  mPRED and MMF caused a significant inhibition of proliferation  whereas everolimus had no effect  Co-stimulation with FK506  mPRED and MMF significantly inhibited proliferation  Serial pulmonary function tests over 12 months after lung biopsy and under the triple-therapy demonstrated that patients with LB had a significant improvement of their FEV1  whereas FEV1 of patients with BO was unchanged Conclusion: Our data demonstrate a pro-poliferative effect of calcineurin inhibitors on primary human lung myofibroblasts obtained from patients with BOS after HSCT  In contrast  based on the observed anti-proliferative capacity of MMF in vitro  MMF-based calcineurin inhibitor-free treatment strategies should be further evaluated in patients with BO after HSCT ,
The prognostic relevance of minimal residual disease  MRD  in patients with multiple myeloma  MM  is still an open question  In the bone marrow  BM  the level of residual myeloma cells is associated with treatment outcome  but the role of clonotypic cells in the peripheral blood  PB  for the prognosis of patients is not identified yet  In this study  we retrospectively analyzed MRD by quantitative real-time IgH-PCR  IgH-qPCR  in the PB of 42 patients undergoing high-dose therapy  HDT  followed by autologous blood stem cell transplantation  PBSCT  as first-line therapy for MM  The MRD level of PB samples was in median 40-fold lower than in BM samples  collected on the same day  with a wide intra- and inter-individual variation  range: 0 4-4628 fold   The presence or absence of detectable MRD levels in PB did not correlate with the serological remission status  Still  patients with negative PCR results in PB three months after HDT and PBSCT had lower ISS stage  p=0 01   lower levels of  2-microglobulin  p=0 02   higher hemoglobin levels  p=0 01  and a prolonged event-free  median: 15 vs 4 months  p=0 004  and overall  median: 52 vs 17 months  p=0 03  survival  Importantly  by sequential monitoring of clonotypic cells in PB  in 19 of 29 patients  66    with progressive disease an increase of the 2IgH á-actin ratio of at least one log step could be detected in median 4 months  range: 0 8-13 months  before the relapse was diagnosed on the basis of the EBMT criteria  These patients with a molecular relapse in PB prior to a serological relapse had a significantly shorter OS than other patients  median: 17 months vs median not reached  p=0 02   In conclusion  IgH-qPCR is a sensitive technique for the detection of clonotypic cells in PB  which precede clinical relapse  Future studies are needed to evaluate whether these circulating tumor cells play a role in promoting disease recurrence ,
Pluripotent stem cells hold great promise for future applications in many areas of regenerative medicine  Their defining property of differentiation towards any of the three germ layers and all derivatives thereof  including somatic stem cells  explains the special interest of the biomedical community in this cell type  In this review  we focus on the current state of directed differentiation of pluripotent stem cells towards hematopoietic stem cells  HSCs   HSCs are especially interesting because they are the longest known and  thus  most intensively investigated somatic stem cells  They were the first stem cells successfully used for regenerative purposes in clinical human medicine  namely in bone marrow transplantation  and also the first stem cells to be genetically altered for the first successful gene therapy trial in humans  However  because of the technical difficulties associated with this rare type of cell  such as the current incapability of prospective isolation  in vitro expansion and gene repair by homologous recombination  there is great interest in using pluripotent stem cells  such as Embryonic Stem  ES-  cells  as a source for generating and genetically altering HSCs  ex vivo  This has been hampered by ethical concerns associated with the use of human ES-cells  However  since Shinya Yamanaka?s successful attempts to reprogram somatic cells of mice and men to an ES-cell like state  so-called induced pluripotent stem  iPS   this field of research has experienced a huge boost  In this brief review  we will reflect on the status quo of directed hematopoietic differentiation of human and mouse pluripotent stem cells ,
Although adult T-cell leukemia  ATL  has a poor prognosis  successful allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  allo-HSCT  in some cases suggests that a cellular immune-mediated strategy can be effective  So far  however  no effective target for anti-ATL immunotherapy has been defined  Here we demonstrated for the first time that human telomerase reverse transcriptase  hTERT  is a promising therapeutic target for ATL and developed a novel redirected T cell-based immunotherapy targeting hTERT  hTERT mRNA was produced abundantly in ATL tumor cells  but not in steady-state normal cells  Rearranged HLA-A*24:02-restricted and hTERT461-469 nonameric peptide-specific T-cell receptor  TCR -    genes were cloned from our previously established CTL clone  K3-1  and inserted into a novel retroviral TCR expression vector encoding siRNAs for endogenous TCR genes in redirected T cells  hTERT-siTCR vector   Consequently  allogeneic or autologous gene-modified CD8 +  T cells prepared using the hTERT-siTCR vector successfully killed ATL tumor cells and newly generated HTLV-1-infected CD4 +  T cells  but not normal cells including steady-state hematopoietic progenitors  in an HLA-A*24:02-restricted manner both in vitro and in vivo  Our experimental observations support the development of a novel hTERT-targeting redirected T cell-based adoptive immunotherapy for ATL patients  especially those for whom suitable allo-HSCT donors are lacking ,
Micro-CT offers high spatial resolution of the distribution of stem cells and provides rapid reconstruction of 3D images and quantitative volumetric analysis  Together with real-time PCR analysis  micro-CT offers the possibility to obtain a quantification of the number of cells that are able to migrate from the bloodstream inside the muscular tissues  Here  we studied for the first time the kinetics of the human cells injected into the femoral artery of DMD animal model  It is fundamental to determine whether the cells disseminate and entrap only within the capillary system of downstream muscles and or they are able to reach the non-injected muscles and other organs through blood flow  The efficient transplantation of stem cells to dystrophic-deficient muscle reinforced the utility of intra-arterial delivery of cells as a viable approach for cell-based clinical therapies of neuromuscular diseases ,
The contact between the immune systems of mother and child during pregnancy affects an immune response of the child against noninherited maternal antigens  NIMA  and the mother against inherited paternal antigens  IPA   However  the immunologic effects of developmental exposure to NIMA or IPA are heterogeneous  and can be either tolerogenic or immunogenic  Although we have reported that prediction of acute graft-vs -host disease  GVHD  is feasible in a murine model  there has been no literature in human  We devised a novel method for predicting a tolerogenic effect by using mixed lymphocyte reaction combined with enzyme-linked immunospot  MLR-ELISPOT  assay  The assay can evaluate reactivity of interferon-  spot-forming cells of donor against the recipient  Although we have shown only two examples of mother to child reactivity so far  our preliminary results suggest that this pre-screened assay may be used to predict acute GVHD  The clinical trial is in progress to evaluate MLR-ELISPOT assay as a predicting measure of acute GVHD in haploidentical transplantation from NIMA or IPA-mismatched family donor ,
Augmentation of microchimerism in solid organ transplant recipients by donor bone marrow cells  DBMC  infusion may promote immune hyporesponsiveness and consequently improve long-term allograft survival  Between March 2005 and July 2007  outcomes for 20 living unrelated donor  LURD  primary kidney recipients with concurrent DBMC infusion  an average of 2 19 ñ 1 13 x 10   9  donor cells consisting of 2 66 ñ 1 70 x 10   7  CD34  +  cells  were prospectively compared with 20 non-infused control allograft recipients given similar conventional immunosuppressive regimens  With five years of clinical follow up  a total of 11 cases experienced rejection episodes  3 DBMI patients vs  8 controls  p = 0 15   One DBMC-infused patient experienced chronic rejection vs  two episodes  1 biopsy-confirmed  in the control patients  Actuarial and death-censored 5-y graft survival was significantly higher in infused patients compared with controls  p = 0 01 and p = 0 03  respectively   Long-term graft survival was significantly associated with pre-transplant anti-HLA antibodies  p = 0 01   slightly with peripheral microchimerism  p = 0 09  and CD4  +  CD25  +  FoxP3  +  T cells  p = 0 09   Immunosuppressant dosing was lower in infused patients than controls  particularly for mycophenolate mofetil  p = 0 001   The current findings as well as our previous reports on these patients indicates clinical improvement in long-term graft survival of renal transplant patients resulting from low-dose DBMC infusion given without induction therapy ,
Hematopoietic stem cell transplant  SCT  remains a curative option for a variety of malignant and non-malignant disorders in children  Following transplant a proportion of SCT recipients become critically ill and need intensive care  Critical illness may occur in the setting of transplant complications such as graft versus host disease  GVHD   idiopathic pneumonia syndrome  IPS   veno-occlusive disease  VOD  and transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy  TA-TMA   Hence  familiarity with recent advances in the transplant process and complications is crucial for the intensivist  This article will highlight common complications encountered in the critically ill SCT recipient ,
The impact of HLA homozygosity at mismatched  MM  loci on the outcome of 2 687 myeloablative unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantations performed for malignant disease was evaluated among four groups: 7 8 bidirectional MM transplants  donor and recipient heterozygous MM  n=1393   7 8 host vs  graft  HVG  vector MM  recipient homozygous  n=112   7 8 graft vs  host  GVH  vector MM  donor homozygous  n=119   and 8 8 matches  n=1063   Multivariate analyses found 7 8 GVH  p=0 001  and bidirectional MM groups  p 0 0001  had significantly worse transplant-related mortality  overall and disease-free survival than the 8 8 match group  a difference not observed with the 7 8 HVG MM group  p 0 01   The three 7 8 groups differed only for grades 3-4 acute GVHD where HVG MM had less GVHD than the 7 8 bidirectional MM  HR 0 52  p=0 0016  and GVH MM  HR 0 43  p=0 0009  but not the 8 8 group  HR 0 83  p=0 39   There were no differences between the 7 8 groups for relapse  chronic GVHD  neutrophil engraftment or graft failure  Unidirectional GVH vector mismatches have the same risk as 7 8 bidirectional mismatches  Recipients with a 7 8 HVG MM have a reduced risk of acute GVHD without an increased risk of disease relapse or graft failure compared to a 7 8 bi-directional MM at a heterozygous locus ,
In neoplastic disorders  endothelial cells take part in tumor progression and also influence the recovery of hematopoiesis after high-dose chemotherapy  Measurements of circulating endothelial cells  CEC   their subsets and kinetics were taken in patients with lymphoid malignancies  37 multiple myeloma  ten lymphoma  during autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT   CEC were evaluated by four-color flow cytometry at different time points  Additionally levels of angiopoietins 1 and 2 were evaluated by ELISA assay  The baseline number of CECs and their subsets in patients were higher than in the control group  The median CEC number dropped significantly after transplantation  from 9 5  L to 6 2  L  p   0 001   Apoptosis of CECs 24ÿh after chemotherapy was enhanced in comparison to baseline values  median apoptotic CEC number 4 15  L vs 3 1  L; p   0 001   The time for neutrophil engraftment was shorter for patients with a low apoptotic CEC count at baseline as compared to those with a high apoptotic CEC count  median time to engraftment 13 vs  16ÿdays respectively  p = 0 04   We observed an adverse correlation of progenitor CEC numbers measured 1ÿh after transplantation with the time to neutrophil engraftment  r = -0 49  p = 0 008   We also found a negative correlation between the number of CECs originating from microvessels measured 1ÿh after transplantation  and the time to neutrophil engraftment  r = -0 39  p = 0 04   Baseline angiopoietins 1 and 2 concentration did not influence the post-transplant regeneration time  CEC numbers significantly change during autologous HSCT  Our results suggest that progenitor CECs and CECs derived from microvessels both take part in successful engraftment ,
All patients with a visceral amyloid syndrome require therapy to prevent deposition of amyloid in other viscera and prevent progressive organ failure of involved sites  Stem cell transplant  SCT  is preferred  but only 20  of patients are eligible  Requirements for safe SCT include NT-proBNP  5 000 ng mL  troponin T   0 06 ng mL  age  70 years   3 organs involved  and serum creatinine  1 7 mg dL  Nontransplant candidates can be offered melphalan-dexamethasone  Pomalidomide appears to have activity  as do other combinations of chemotherapy with agents such as cyclophosphamide-thalidomide  or lenalidomide or bortezomib -dexamethasone  bortezomib-dexamethasone  and melphalan-prednisone-lenalidomide  FUTURE CHALLENGES: Late diagnosis remains a major obstacle to initiating effective therapy when organ dysfunction is still recoverable  Recognizing the presenting syndromes is necessary for improving survival  Am  J  Hematol  88:417-425  2013  ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
Primary infection with KIPyV and WUPyV polyomaviruses occurs early in childhood followed by lifelong persistence in the body  Polyomavirus reactivation can occur in the presence of impaired immunity as in hematological malignancies or during immunosuppresssion induced by medications  In this study  reactivation of KIPyV and WUPyV was monitored by conventional PCR in plasma samples of 26 stem cell transplant patients and in 26 related bone marrow donors  Plasma samples from transplant patients were collected immediately after the end of conditioning regimen and up to 270 days after transplant  All plasma samples from transplant patients were negative for KIPyV and WUPyV DNA  Instead  KIPyV DNA was detected in two bone marrow donors  There was no evidence of KIPyV transmission from the donor to the recipient  The data suggest that detection of KIPyV in plasma is sporadic and that KPIyV and WUPyV do not affect the post-transplant clinical course  However  further studies on a larger sample size and more sensitive PCR methods are needed to confirm these observations  J  Med  Virol  85: 1122-1124  2013  ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
Although filgrastim-induced splenomegaly  splenic hematomas  and splenic rupture are rare  clinicians working in the bone marrow transplant setting should be cognizant of the potential of growth factors to cause these adverse events ,
Our study indicates that ECFCs emerge from a CD45 +  and CD31 +  progenitor and rapidly mature in culture  ECFCs have a significantly higher potential for tumor targeting than non-cultured CD34 +  cells and HUVECs  They are ideal candidates for future cell-based anti-cancer therapies ,
Transplantation with hematopoietic stem cells  HSC  from a donor with a single human leukocyte antigen  HLA  mismatch can be proposed to those patients lacking an HLA identical sibling donor or an unrelated donor matched for the HLA-A  -B  -C  DRB1  DQB1 loci  Incompatibilities at HLA classes I and II loci are associated with an increased risk of graft-versus-host disease  GVHD  and mortality  although no consensus exists yet on the relative importance of specific allele disparities on clinical outcome  Donor search algorithms are now complicated by the growing number of new HLA alleles  in particular those that differ outside the peptide-binding site of the HLA molecules  We report here an in vitro cellular assay to quantify CD8+CD137+ alloreactive cytotoxic T lymphocytes  CTLs  in a one-way mixed lymphocyte reaction  Two unique combinations with a single HLA mismatch in the HLA-B44 serotype differing by one amino acid in the  3 domain were investigated  We show that the B*44:27 versus B*44:02 mismatch was not recognized by CTLs in both directions  At days 10 and 20  the frequency of CD8+CD137+T cells was comparable to that measured in the autologous stimulation  0 3-3 9    A B*44:02 versus B*44:03 mismatch was  however  well recognized at day 10  7 2   and day 20  17 8    This is the first demonstration that a single HLA-B mismatch involving a residue outside the peptide-binding site is not recognized in an in vitro functional assay and may probably be considered as a permissive incompatibility in vivo ,
Endothelial cells  ECs  are aligned longitudinally under laminar flow  whereas they are polygonal and poorly aligned in regions of disturbed flow  The unaligned ECs in disturbed flow fields manifest altered function and reduced survival that promote lesion formation  We demonstrate that the alignment of the ECs may directly influence their biology  independent of fluid flow  We developed aligned nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds that mimic the structure of collagen bundles in blood vessels  and examined the effects of these materials on EC alignment  function  and inÿvivo survival  ECs cultured on 30-nm diameter aligned fibrils re-organized their F-actin along the nanofibril direction  and were 50  less adhesive for monocytes than the ECs grown on randomly oriented fibrils  After EC transplantation into both subcutaneous tissue and the ischemic hindlimb  EC viability was enhanced when ECs were cultured and implanted on aligned nanofibrillar scaffolds  in contrast to non-patterned scaffolds  ECs derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells and cultured on aligned scaffolds also persisted for over 28 days  as assessed by bioluminescence imaging  when implanted in ischemic tissue  By contrast  ECs implanted on scaffolds without nanopatterning generated no detectable bioluminescent signal by day 4 in either normal or ischemic tissues  We demonstrate that 30-nm aligned nanofibrillar collagen scaffolds guide cellular organization  modulate endothelial inflammatory response  and enhance cell survival after implantation in normal and ischemic tissues ,
Isolated extramedullary disease  EMD  is uncommon  especially in acute promyelocytic leukemia  APL  after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT   We review the literature and present a 32 year old woman with APL who developed multiple EMDs after allogeneic HSCT within the calvarium  and later found to have various isolated lesions including femur  humerus and thoraco lumbar vertebrae  She was treated with local radiotherapy  XRT  to EMD lesions  all-trans retinoic acid  arsenic trioxide and donor lymphocyte infusion at different time points in her clinical course  without success  Out of reported cases in clinical setting as ours  average onset of isolated EMD is 25 months and median survival 14 months  Effective treatment of isolated EMD after HSCT is not yet clear  but ATO in combination with local XRT  tamibarotene and second HSCT have shown good results in some reported cases  but accumulation of more cases is needed to elucidate optimal therapy in such setting ,
This retrospective data analysis examined the outcome of 99 acute lymphoblastic leukemia  ALL  patients treated at Tawam Hospital between January 2000 and December 2009  Sixteen patients were treated before June 2002  and 83 patients were treated from June 2002  A modified form of UKALL XII ECOG E2993 with pulsed dexamethasone in induction phase one  modified UKALL  was the main therapy from June 2002  71 83   The median age was 28 years  Fifty-eight percent had pre-B ALL where 36   of them were Philadelphia chromosome-positive  Ph+   Overall  complete remission  CR  rate was 86 7   which was significantly inferior for patients with white blood cell count 30-100 ? 10  l  p = 0 009   therapy before June 2002  p = 0 02   pregnancy  p = 0 005   CNS leukemia  p = 0 028   and unknown karyotype  p = 0 004   With a median follow-up of 11 8 months  0 49-126 months   the estimated overall survival  OS  and event-free survival  EFS  at 3 years were 50 6 and 28 7    respectively  OS and EFS were significantly inferior for patients not in CR after induction  age  20 years  Ph+  unknown karyotype and therapy before June 2002  In addition  CR  OS and EFS were significantly superior  p = 0 004  p   0 001 and p = 0 001  respectively  for therapy with our modified UKALL protocol compared to Tawam protocol  main therapy before June 2002   In conclusion  the outcome of treatment for ALL at our institute is encouraging with significant improvement in the outcome of older adolescents and young adults when using high-intensity chemotherapy  This suggests that such an approach is feasible in developing countries in spite of some limitations including lack of stem cell transplantation service ,
Long-term stable mixed chimerism  MC  is a rare phenomenon after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  characterized by 5  to 95  residual recipient hematopoietic cells  The underlying mechanisms of MC are largely unknown  In this study we compared full donor chimerism with long-lasting stable MC for a median of 9 5 years  range  5 to 16 5  post-HSCT in patients with nonmalignant diseases  Several factors significantly associated with the likelihood of stable MC development were identified by univariate analysis  eg  younger donor age  sibling donor  and conditioning regimen  Despite a limited patient cohort  our multivariate analysis could confirm that a sibling donor was associated with stable MC development  Furthermore  development of acute-graft-versus-host disease and blood stream infection was significantly more prevalent in the full donor chimerism patient group  Additionally  significant fluctuations in the recipient-to-donor chimerism ratio decreased over time after HSCT in MC patients ,
Background  The long-term impact of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  on human immunodeficiency virus type 1  HIV-1  reservoirs in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy  cART  is largely unknown  Methods  We studied the effects of a reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HSCT from donors with wild-type-CCR5 +  cells on HIV-1 peripheral blood reservoirs in 2 patients heterozygous for the ccr5 32 mutation  In-depth analyses of the HIV-1 reservoir size in peripheral blood  coreceptor use  and specific antibody responses were performed on samples obtained before and up to 3 5 years after HSCT receipt  Results  Although HIV-1 DNA was readily detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells  PBMCs  before and 2-3 months after HSCT receipt  HIV-1 DNA and RNA were undetectable in PBMCs  CD4 +  T cells  or plasma up to 21 and 42 months after HSCT  The loss of detectable HIV-1 correlated temporally with full donor chimerism  development of graft-versus-host disease  and decreases in HIV-specific antibody levels  Conclusions  The ability of donor cells to engraft without evidence of ongoing HIV-1 infection suggests that HIV-1 replication may be fully suppressed during cART and does not contribute to maintenance of viral reservoirs in peripheral blood in our patients  HSCTs with wild-type-CCR5 +  donor cells can lead to a sustained reduction in the size of the peripheral reservoir of HIV-1 ,
This study examines the long-term outcomes of a cohort of patients with myeloma who were treated with reduced-intensity conditioning  RIC  regimens after a minimum follow-up of 5 years at our centre  A total of 53 patients with multiple myeloma  MM  who received allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation  Allo-SCT  between January 2000 and January 2007 were identified  The median follow-up of living patients was 84 months  51-141   The median age of the MM patients was 50  28-70  years  Fifty-one patients  96   received a transplant from a sibling donor  The median time between diagnosis and Allo-SCT was 34 months  6-161   and the median time between auto-SCT and Allo-SCT was 10 months  1-89   Fifty-one patients  96   received at least one auto-SCT; 24 patients  45   received a tandem auto-Allo-SCT  At last follow-up  21 patients  40   are alive   5 years post RIC Allo-SCT  At last follow-up  14  26   are in first complete remission  CR   and four patients  8   in second CR after donor lymphocyte infusion or re-induction with one of the new anti-myeloma drugs  bortezomib or lenalidomide  after Allo-SCT  Eight patients  38   among these long survivors received one of these new drugs as induction or relapse treatment before Allo-SCT  Disease status and occurrence of cGvHD were significantly associated with progression-free survival  PFS ; hazard ratio  HR  = 0 62  0 30-1 29  P = 0 20   Acute GvHD was correlated with higher transplant-related mortality; HR = 4 19  1 05-16 77  P = 0 04   No variables were associated with overall survival  OS   In conclusion  we observe that long-term disease control can be expected in a subset of MM patients undergoing RIC Allo-SCT  After 10 years  the OS and PFS were 32  and 24   respectively  The PFS curve after Allo-SCT stabilizes in time with a plateau after 6 years post Allo-SCT  Am  J  Hematol  88:370-374  2013  ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
INTRODUCTION: Pulmonary infiltrates are common within the hematopoietic stem cell transplant  HSCT  population and unfortunately portend an increased mortality  Bronchoscopy is often utilized as an initial diagnostic tool  but the literature supporting its diagnostic utility and effect on clinical management varies significantly  The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic ability  complication rate  and clinical impact of flexible bronchoscopy  FB  in evaluating pulmonary infiltrates in a large HSCT population  PATIENTS AND METHOD: Retrospective review of all patients undergoing FB after HSCT in the Bone Marrow Transplant Unit from 1996 to 2009  RESULTS: FB was performed 162times in 144patients with pulmonary infiltrates yielding positive results in 52 5   The most common positive results were bacterial pneumonia  31    fungal pneumonia  15    and alveolar hemorrhage  11    Treatment changes occurred in 44  of patients after FB  Treatment changes included antibiotic modification  59    addition of corticosteroids  21    antifungal modification  12    and antiviral modification  7    The overall complication rate associated with FB was 30   although 84  of these complications were considered minor  CONCLUSIONS: FB in patients with pulmonary infiltrates after HSCT should still be considered a valuable tool in the evaluation and management of pulmonary infiltrates in the HSCT population  Future prospective  multicenter randomized studies are needed to evaluate the overall clinical impact that bronchoscopic results and management changes have in this unique population ,
The patient s course supports suggestions that immunological dysfunction in nephrosis is associated with abnormality of immature  relatively unclassified T cells  CD34 +   representing hematopoietic stem cells  as opposed to mature T cells  CD34 -   ,
We investigated the use of adoptively transferred donor-derived cytomegalovirus  CMV  specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  CTL  as immune reconstitution postallogeneic transplant in a phase 2 study  Fifty patients were infused with a single dose of 2 ? 10 7 cells m 2  after day 28 post-transplant  Twenty-six patients reactivated CMV posttransplant  only 5 post-CTL infusion  and 9 required therapy with ganciclovir or foscarnet  only 1 post-CTL infusion   There was 1 case of fatal CMV disease  attributable to high levels of antithymocyte globulin at the time of T cell infusion  We compared the patients in the phase 2 study with a group of contemporaneous controls also treated at the trial centers  There was no increase in acute or chronic graft-versus-host disease attributable to CTL infusion; overall and progression-free survival were similar in both groups  There was a reduction in the percentage of patients who required CMV directed antiviral therapy  17  vs 36   P =  01  and in the total number of treatment days in the cohort receiving CTL  3 4 days vs 8 9 days  P =  03  without a reduction in CMV reactivation rates  We postulate that adoptively transferred cells are able to expand in response to viral antigen  limit viral replication  and prevent progression to tissue infection  This study was registered on the Australian Clinical Trial Registry as #ACTRN12605000213640 and #ACTRN12607000224426 ,
Iron overload  IO   primarily related to multiple red blood cell transfusions  is a relatively common complication in hematopoietic stem cell transplant  HSCT  recipients  Elevated pretransplant ferritin levels have been reported to increase the risk of non-relapse mortality following HSCT and might influence the risk of acute and chronic graft versus host disease  IO has been shown to be an important cause of mortality and morbidity in patients who have undergone alloHSCT  Armand et al   Blood 109:4586-4588  2007; Kim et al   Acta Haematol 120:182-189  2008; Kataoka et al   Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 15:195-204  2009   We know that excessive iron accumulation results in tissue damage and organ failure  mainly as a result of the generation of free radicals that cause oxidative damage and organ dysfunction  e g   hepatotoxicity  cardiotoxicity  and endocrine dysfunction   Altes et al   Bone Marrow Transplantation 29: 987-989  2002; Papanikolaou et al   Toxicol Appl Pharmac 202:199-211  2005   In the last decade  efforts have been directed toward identifying alternative treatment for IO in alloHSCT recipients to maintain improved transplant outcomes ,
Significant controversy exists regarding the impact of hematopoietic stroma damage by irradiation on the efficiency of engraftment of intravenously transplanted stem cells  It was previously demonstrated that in normal syngenic mice  all intravenously transplanted donor stem cells  present in the bone marrow  compete equally with those of the host  In this study  we comprehensively compared the blood cell production derived from transplanted donor stem cells with that from the host stem cells surviving various doses of submyeloablative irradiation  We compared the partial chimerism resulting from transplantation with theoretical estimates that assumed transplantation efficiencies ranging from 100  to 20   The highest level of consensus between the experimental and the theoretical results was 100  for homing and engraftment  ie  the utilization of all transplanted stem cells   These results point to a very potent mechanism through which intravenously administered hematopoietic stem cells are captured from circulation  engraft in the hematopoietic tissue  and contribute to blood cell production in irradiated recipients  The damage done to hematopoietic stroma and to the trabecular bone by submyeloablative doses of ionizing radiation does not negatively affect the homing and engraftment mechanisms of intravenously transplanted hematopoietic progenitor and stem cells ,
A BMI  30 kg m 2  was independently associated with a higher survival rate after HSCT  Obese patients should not be excluded as transplant candidates based only on this parameter ,
We analyzed the outcomes of 61 patients with hematologic malignancies who underwent double-unit cord blood transplantation  dCBT  after myeloablative conditioning performed as part of a prospective multicenter phase II study  The conditioning regimen for dCBT included total body irradiation  cyclophosphamide  and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor combined with cytosine arabinoside for myeloid malignancies and with total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide for lymphoid malignancies  The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment after dCBT was 85   95  confidence interval [CI]  73 -92    All 51 of the patients who engrafted had complete chimerism derived from a single donor by dayÿ+60  Only the degree of HLA disparity in the host-versus-graft direction had an impact on unit dominance  The cumulative incidence of grade II-IV acute graft-versus-host disease was 25   95  CI  15 -37    and that of chronic graft-versus-host disease was 32   95  CI  20 -44    The 1-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 23   95  CI  13 -34    and that of transplantation-related mortality was 28   95  CI  17 -39    With a median follow-up of 41 months  event-free survival was 48   90  CI  37 -58   at 1 year and 46   90  CI  35 -56   at 3 years  Event-free survival at 3 years was 67   95  CI  46 -81   for patients with standard risk and 29   95  CI  15 -45   for those with advanced risk  This study suggests that dCBT after myeloablative conditioning is a promising alternative for adults and large children with hematologic malignancies who need stem cell transplantation but lack a suitable adult donor or an adequate single-unit cord blood graft ,
HLA-matched related donor  MRD  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  is a well-established therapy for patients with sickle cell disease  SCD ; however  experience using alternative donors  including haploidentical donors  in HSCT for SCD is limited  We report the long-term outcomes of 22 pediatric patients who underwent related donor HSCT for SCD at St  Jude Children s Research Hospital  either a myeloablative sibling MRD HSCT  nÿ= 14  or reduced-intensity parental haploidentical donor HSCT  nÿ= 8   The median patient age was 11 0 ñ 3 9 years in the MRD graft recipients and 9 0 ñ 5 0 years in the haploidentical donor graft recipients  The median follow-up was 9 0 ñ 2 3 years  with an overall survival  OS  of 93  and a recurrence graft failure rate of 0   for the MRD cohort and 7 4 ñ 2 4 years  with an OS of 75   disease-free survival of 38   and disease recurrence of 38   for the haploidentical donor cohort  We report the long-term hematologic response and organ function in patients undergoing MRD or haploidentical donor HSCT for severe SCD  Our data demonstrate long-term hematologic improvements after HSCT with sustained engraftment  and confirm that HSCT offers long-term protection from common complications of SCD  including stroke  pulmonary hypertension  acute chest  and nephropathy  regardless of donor source ,
Haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  constitutes an important alternative for patients lacking a human leukocyte antigen  HLA -matched donor  Although the use of haploidentical donors is increasingly common  the long-term impact of generating a donor-derived immune system in the context of an HLA-mismatched thymic environment remains poorly characterized  We performed an in-depth assessment of immune reconstitution in a group of haploidentical HSCT recipients 4 to 6 years posttransplantation  in parallel with the respective parental donors and age-matched healthy control subjects  Our data show that the proportion of naive and memory subsets in the recipients  both within CD8 +  and CD4 +  T cells  more closely resembled that observed in age-matched control subjects than in the donors  HSCT recipients displayed relatively high signal-joint T cell-receptor excision circle levels and a high frequency of the recent thymic emigrant-enriched CD31 +  subset within naive CD4 +  and naive regulatory T cells  Moreover  CD8 +   CD4 +   and regulatory T cells from HSCT recipients displayed a diverse T cell repertoire  These results support a key role for thymic output in T cell reconstitution  Nevertheless  HSCT recipients had significantly shorter telomeres within a naive-enriched CD4 +  T cell population than age-matched control subjects  despite the similar telomere length observed within the most differentiated CD8 +  and CD4 +  T cell subsets  Overall  our data suggest that long-term immune reconstitution was successfully achieved after haploidentical HSCT  a process that appears to have largely relied on de novo T cell production ,
Human leukocyte antigen  HLA  partially matched related donor  PMRD  hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  is an effective option for hematological malignancies  In this study  the nonmalignant late effects of PMRD HSCT were evaluated and compared with HLA-identical sibling donor  ISD  HSCT  Three hundred thirteen patients  ISD  nÿ= 160; PMRD  nÿ= 153  who survived at least 6 months and received regular follow-up examinations after their HSCT were enrolled  The 5-year cumulative incidence  ñSE  of at least one late effect and multiple late effects was 47 30  ñ  17  versus 58 21  ñ  16   Pÿ=  134  and 17 97  ñ  10  versus 34 28  ñ  15   Pÿ=  001  for PMRD HSCT recipients versus ISD HSCT recipients  respectively  The cumulative incidence of keratoconjunctivitis sicca  periodontitis  ankylosis  myalgia  and nephrotic syndrome was lower among PMRD HSCT recipients compared with ISD HSCT recipients  Severe chronic graft-versus-host disease  multiple pre-HSCT chemotherapy cycles  female donor  and older age were risk factors for at least one late effect  Female donor  older age  and long-term immunosuppressive therapy were associated with multiple late effects  In summary  PMRD HSCT recipients have a lower risk of late effects compared with ISD HSCT recipients  possibly due to differences in protocols for graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis  and long-term follow-up after transplantation is recommended ,
Uncontrolled cytomegalovirus  CMV  reactivation after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation causes significant morbidity and mortality  Adoptive transfer of CMV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes  CTLs  is a promising therapy to treat reactivation and prevent viral disease  In this article  we describe the generation of clinical-grade CMV-specific CTLs directly from granulocyte colony-stimulating factor-mobilized hemopoietic progenitor cell  G-HPC  products collected for transplantation  This method requires less than 2 5  of a typical G-HPC product to reproducibly expand CMV-specific CTLs exÿvivo  Comparison of 11 CMV CTL lines generated from G-HPC products with 52 CMV CTL lines generated from nonmobilized peripheral blood revealed similar expansion kinetics and phenotype  G-HPC-derived CTLs produced IFN-  after reexposure toÿCMVpp65 antigen and exhibited CMV-directed cytotoxicity but no alloreactivity against transplantation recipient-derived cells  Seven patients received CMV-specific CTL lines expanded from G-HPC products inÿa prophylactic adoptive immunotherapy phase I II clinical trial  Use of G-HPC products will facilitate integration of CTL generation into established quality systems of transplantation centers and more rapid inclusion of Tÿcell therapies into routine clinical care ,
We evaluated the outcome of children and adolescents with acquired severe aplastic anemia  SAA  who received haploidentical hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HHCT  with inÿvitro T cell-depleted peripheral blood stem cells  Twelve patients with acquired SAA received a total of 15 HHCTs with inÿvitro CD3-depleted grafts between July 2009 and July 2012  Among the 12 patients  11 achieved neutrophil engraftment at a median of 10 days  range  9 to 13 days  after HHCT  One patient failed to achieve primary engraftment  and two experienced graft rejection soon after engraftment  All three patients who experienced early graft failure received a second HHCT and achieved sustained engraftment  Thus  the final engraftment rate was 100   Acute graft-versus-host disease was assessed in 9 patients  excluding the 3 patients with early graft failure  Three of these patients developed acute graft-versus-host disease  two   grade II and one with grade III   All 12 patients survived and were transfusion-independent at a median follow-up of 14 3ÿmonths  range  4 1 to 40 7 months   Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation from haploidentical family donors with inÿvitro CD3 T cell depletion is a reasonable therapeutic option for children and adolescents with acquired SAA  Our future trial with a uniform protocol will help to solve the problems associated with HHCT and provide a valuable platform for the further development of HHCT as a therapy for SAA ,
Central line-associated blood stream infections  CLABSI  commonly complicate the care of patients with acute myeloid leukemia  AML  and myelodysplastic syndrome  MDS  after allogeneic stem cell transplantation  HCT   We developed a modified CLABSI  MCLABSI  definition that attempts to exclude pathogens usually acquired because of disruption of mucosal barriers during the vulnerable neutropenic period following HCT that are generally included under the original definition  OCLABSI   We conducted a retrospective study of all AML and MDS patients undergoing HCT between August 2009 and December 2011 at the Cleveland Clinic  Nÿ=ÿ73   identifying both OCLABSI and MCLABSI incidence  The median age at transplantation was 52 years  range  16 to 70 ; 34 had a high   3  HCT comorbidity index  HCT-CI ; 34 received bone marrow  BM   24 received peripheral stem cells  PSC   and 15 received umbilical cord blood cells  UCB   Among these 73 patients  23  31 5   developed OCLABSI  of whom 16  69 6   died  and 8  11   developed MCLABSI  of whom 7  87 5   died  OCLABSI was diagnosed a median of 9 days from HCT: 5 days  range  2 to 12  for UCB and 78 days  range  7 to 211  for BM PSC  Pÿ ÿ 001   MCLABSI occurred a median of 12 days from HCT  with similar earlier UCB and later BM PSC diagnosis  Pÿ=ÿ 030   Risk factors for OCLABSI in univariate analysis included CBC  Pÿ ÿ 001   human leukocyte antigen  HLA -mismatch  Pÿ=ÿ 005   low CD34 +  count  Pÿ=ÿ 007   low total nucleated cell dose  Pÿ=ÿ 016   and non-Caucasian race  Pÿ=ÿ 017   Risk factors for OCLABSI in multivariable analysis were UCB  Pÿ ÿ 001  and high HCT-CI  Pÿ=ÿ 002   There was a significant increase in mortality for both OCLABSI  hazard ratio  7 14; CI  3 31 to 15 37; Pÿ ÿ 001  and MCLABSI  hazard ratio  6 44; CI  2 28 to 18 18; Pÿ ÿ 001   CLABSI is common and associated with high mortality in AML and MDS patients undergoing HCT  especially in UCB recipients and those with high HCT-CI  We propose the MCLABSI definition to replace the OCLABSI definition  given its greater precision for identifying preventable infection in HCT patients ,
Allogeneic stem cell transplantation  SCT  is the most effective treatment option for many hematologic malignancies  but graft-versus-host disease  GVHD  remains a major cause of treatment failure  Along with well-established risk factors for transplantation outcomes  recent single-center studies have identified a birth order effect in HLA-identical sibling SCT  with lower rates of acute and chronic GVHD and improved overall survival when the donor is younger than the recipient  One hypothesized mechanism for this effect is microchimerism due to fetomaternal and transmaternal sibling cell trafficking during pregnancy as the donor is exposed to recipient antigens in utero  The aim of the present study was to validate previously reported single-center data in a large  multicenter cohort provided by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation  All adult and pediatric patients  nÿ=ÿ11 365  with a hematologic malignancy who underwent allogeneic SCT with a graft from an HLA-identical sibling donor between 1990 and 2007 were included  When donors were younger than recipients  there was a significantly lower rate of acute GVHD grade II-IV and chronic GVHD in children  as well as a lower rate of chronic GVHD in adolescents  However  the hypothesized overall positive effect of lower relapse and better survival when donors are younger than recipients was not observed  Our data suggest that if otherwise equally matched  a graft from a younger sibling may be superior to a graft from an older sibling for children and adolescents undergoing SCT ,
The effectiveness of high-dose chemotherapy  HDT  followed by autologous stem cell transplantation  ASCT  as a frontline treatment in peripheral T cell lymphomas  PTCLs  is still unclear  We retrospectively investigated the clinical outcomes of HDT ASCT as an intensifying frontline treatment in 31 patients with newly diagnosed PTCLs  The conditioning regimen of HDT ASCT consisted of busulfan  cyclophosphamide  and etoposide  BuCyE   At diagnosis  five  16 1ÿ   patients were classified as high risk according to the prognostic index for PTCL  PIT   The disease status of the patients before HDT ASCT consisted of 23 patients  74 2ÿ   with complete response  CR  and eight patients  25 8ÿ   with partial response  PR   Six  75ÿ   out of eight patients with PR at pretransplantation were improved in terms of the response to CR after HDT ASCT  At a median follow-up of 32 4ÿmonths  the 3-year probability of overall survival  OS  and progression-free survival  PFS  was 64 5 ñ 8 6ÿ   Transplant-related mortality occurred in three patients  9 7ÿ    due to septic shock  hemorrhage  and delayed pneumonia  respectively  Bone marrow involvement of PTCL at diagnosis was a poor prognostic factor for OS  In conclusion  frontline HDT ASCT with a conditioning regimen of BuCyE may be an effective and tolerable intensifying therapeutic option to improve outcomes in patients with PTCLs ,
The monitoring of minimal residual disease  MRD  through low sensitivity real-time  RT  polymerase chain reaction  PCR  analysis of BCR-ABL transcripts allows early detection of chronic myeloid leukemia  CML  relapse after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT   The introduction of more sensitive techniques  such as RT quantitative  Q -PCR  may lead to an overestimation of the risk of CML relapse  In this study  we reviewed the results of peripheral blood RT Q-PCR in CML patients who underwent allogeneic HSCT from 1983 to 2007  In our laboratory  RT Q-PCR analysis was routinely performed since 2002  Eighty-seven of 189 patients had available RT Q-PCR data; 63 patients had at least 3 RT Q-PCR analyses assessable  Fifty-two of 63 patients  83   had  at least once  detectable transcript levels  but with an BCR-ABL ABL ratioÿ  1  defined as  MR3  molecular remission  0 1    whereas 11  17   had persistent undetectable BCR-ABL transcripts  Six of 52 patients with  MR3 relapsed  defined as BCR-ABL transcript numbersÿ  1  confirmed by the finding of Ph+ cells in bone marrow  No patients with persistent undetectable transcripts relapsed  Pÿ=ÿ 19   Relapse did not correlate with the number of occurrences of  MR3 or with the time to the first  MR3 result  Finally  of 46 patients with detectable transcripts who did not relapse  35 had undetectable transcripts at last contact  RT Q-PCR analysis had low specificity  19   and low positive predictive value  12   in predicting relapse of CML patients after allogeneic HSCT  Our data suggest that detection of low BCR-ABL transcript levels by RT Q-PCR analysis has a poor accuracy in defining the risk of CML relapse and should not be considered as the unique indication to treatment  Fluctuation of BCR-ABL transcripts levels is common as late as  10 years posttransplantation  possibly suggesting the long-term persistence of CML stem cells ,
High-dose conditioning and autologous PBSCT is associated with deterioration in nutritional status  QoL and PAL  with LBM remaining below baseline levels at 100ÿdays post-transplantation  A nutrition and exercise intervention program post-hospital discharge may be beneficial for these patients ,
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  exposes a patient s kidneys to a unique combination of challenges  including high-dose radiation  anemia  chemotherapeutic agents  graft-versus-host disease  opportunistic infections  attenuated and altered immunologic responses  fluid and electrolyte imbalances  and extensive courses of antimicrobial agents  Since the inception of HSCT in the 1950s  there has been increasing interest in defining  determining  and managing the kidney complications that accompany this procedure  In this article  we review the common causes of acute kidney injury and chronic kidney disease that occur with HSCT  including HSCT-associated thrombotic microangiopathy  a distinct cause of chronic kidney disease with a multifactorial cause previously known as bone marrow transplant nephropathy or radiation nephropathy  Additionally  we review other kidney complications  including calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity and chronic graft-versus-host disease-associated glomerulonephritis  that develop post-HSCT  Critically  due to its grave prognosis  it is important to identify HSCT-associated thrombotic microangiopathy early  as well as distinguish it from the other causes of chronic kidney disease ,
This study indicates that periodontal infections may contribute to the risk of developing OVS and CONS bacteremia during neutropenia following HSCT  While our results point to the importance of periodontal evaluation and management before HSCT  further studies on periodontal contribution to systemic infectious complications are warranted ,
Knowledge concerning the clinical and biological characteristics of acute leukemia of ambiguous lineage  ALAL  is limited so that there has been a lack of uniformity in treatment  In this report  we retrospectively investigated the effect of intensified conditioning on adult ALAL undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  allo-HSCT   A total of 59 patients with ALAL  male in 37 cases and female in 22 cases  were consecutively enrolled in the data analyses  Twenty-four patients received the standard conditioning  total body irradiation  TBI  + cyclophosphamide  CY  or busulfan + CY protocol  and 35 received the intensified conditioning  TBI + CY + etoposide or fludarabine + cytarabine plus TBI + CY + etoposide protocol   Five-year transplant-related mortality was 17 6 ñ 9 6ÿ  and 25 5 ñ 8 0ÿ   the 5-year overall survival  OS  post-transplantation was 23 8 ñ 8 9ÿ  and 64 0 ñ 8 4ÿ   disease-free survival was 16 7 ñ 7 6ÿ  and 55 8 ñ 9 4ÿ   the 5-year cumulative incidence of relapse was 80 8 ñ 8 5ÿ  and 28 8 ñ 9 9ÿ   respectively  in the standard and the intensified group  P = 0 380  P = 0 029  P = 0 005  and P   0 001   Both univariate and multivariate analysis indicated that the intensified conditioning regimen and acute graft-versus-host disease were favorable factors to reduce the relapse  The younger patients  patients with CR at the time of transplantation  and the intensified conditioning regimen were favorable factors to elevate the survival  In conclusion  intensified conditioning regimens followed by allo-HSCT might improve long-term survival and decrease relapse of leukemia in adult ALAL compared to the standard conditioning regimens ,
In childhood Hodgkin lymphoma  estimated 5 years survival rates exceed 90   Long-term survival continues to decline from delayed toxicities  Key findings from recent Children s Oncology Group trials include:  1  Radiotherapy selection may be based on early chemotherapy response assessed by both FDG-PET and CT imaging   2  A new prognostic factor score stratifies patients into risk categories; and  3  novel retrieval regimens were identified  A phase I II trial is investigating Brentuximab vedotin  Bv  with gemcitabine in relapsed patients  A phase 3 trial will modify conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy approaches through the addition of Bv  while incorporating translational biology to identify molecular targets  Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013; 60: 972-978  ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
The role of SCT in pediatric oncology has continued to evolve with the introduction of new therapeutic agents and immunological insights into cancer  COG has focused its efforts on the study of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of pediatric malignancies in several major multi-institutional Phase II and Phase III studies  These studies include addressing the impact of allogenicity in ALL  ASCT0431   and establishing autologous stem cell transplant as the standard of care in neuroblastoma  Reducing transplant-associated toxicity was addressed in the ASCT0521 study  where the TNF  inhibitor etanercept was tested for the treatment of idiopathic pneumonia syndrome  Impact of cell dose was explored in the single versus tandem umbilical cord blood study CTN-0501  in close collaboration with the BMT-CTN  Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013; 60: 1044-1047  ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
Estimated 5-year survival rates for patients with non-high-risk and high-risk neuroblastoma are 90  and 50   respectively  Recent clinical trials have shown excellent outcomes with reduced therapy for non-high-risk disease  For patients with high-risk neuroblastoma treated with chemoradiotherapy  surgery  and stem cell transplantation  the addition of anti-disialoganglioside  GD2  immunotherapy plus cytokines improves survival  Upcoming trials will study the incorporation of targeted radionuclide therapy prior to myeloablative chemotherapy into high-risk treatment  Phase 2 trials will investigate druggable target s  including mTOR inhibition and GD2-directed therapy in combination with chemotherapy for patients with recurrent neuroblastoma  and ALK inhibition for those with ALK-aberrant tumors  Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013; 60: 985-993  ? 2013 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
The present study suggests that SPA could be useful as an indicator of survival and nutritional status for patients undergoing HSCT ,
Low incidence of graft-versus-host disease provides the major rational for pursuing umbilical cord blood  UCB  stem cell transplantation  SCT   Considerable evidence also suggests a lower rate of recurrence after UCB SCT than after transplantation from adult donors  Recent advances in understanding of the human fetal immune development provide a rational underpinning for these clinical outcomes  The fetal immune system is geared toward maintaining tolerance to foreign antigens  particularly to the maternal antigens to which it is exposed throughout gestation  To this purpose it is dominated by a unique population of peripheral T regulatory cells that actively maintain tolerance  This and other features of the UCB lymphoid system explains the low incidence of graft-versus-host disease and superior outcomes of UCB SCT with noninherited maternal antigen-matched grafts  At the same time  highly sensitized maternal microchimeric cells are frequently detected in UCB and likely contribute to superior graft-versus-leukemia effects and low rates of disease recurrence in inherited paternal antigen-matched UCB recipients  However  historically erratic and slow hematopoietic recovery after UCB SCT leads to increased early morbidity and mortality  excessive hospitalization  and increased costs  This has held up the widespread utilization of UCB SCT in adults  Here we summarize recent data on UCB SCT with an emphasis on studies of co-infusion of adult CD34 selected hematopoietic stem cells with UCB SCT  This procedure  through transient engraftment of adult hematopoietic stem cells  largely overcomes the problem of delayed engraftment  It also results in predictable engraftment of a UCB with the desired characteristics  We also briefly discuss unresolved issues and possible future applications of this technology ,
Percutaneous placement of radial artery catheters can be rapidly and safely performed in very small infants and in children with difficult venous access  This technique provides a reliable platform for efficient PBSCC  Pediatr Blood Cancer 2013; 60: 946-948  ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals  Inc ,
BACKGROUND: Cell transplantation of human cord blood mononuclear progenitor cells  HCBMCs  is a new treatment that could restore cardiac functions after acute myocardial infarction  AMI   We hypothesize that multiple doses of HCBMCs might increase homing of transplanted cells to infarcted region  and improve outcome of AMI via inhibition of ischemic-induced inflammatory responses  METHODS AND RESULTS: HCBMCs were injected intravenously to rabbits that previously underwent ligation of left anterior coronary artery  LAD   Single dose of HCBMCs was intravenously delivered on the 7th day or multiple doses of HCBMCs were delivered on the 7th  9th  11th and 13th day after AMI  Homing of HCBMCs was determined by 5-bromodeoxyuridine  BrdU  labeling  The amount of grafted cells homed and retained in the infarcted area was significantly increased in the rabbits that received multiple doses  More viable cardiomyocytes and less collagen deposition were observed also in the group with more injections  Cardiac functions were assessed by echocardiography and hemodynamics  Multiple doses of HCBMCs showed significant benefits in preservation of cardiac functions  In infarcted myocardium  multiple transplantations of HCBMCs showed a significant increase in the myocardial level of anti-inflammatory IL-10 and a marked decrease in the level of the pro-inflammatory IL-6  CONCLUSIONS: Multiple injections of HCBMCs markedly increased the amount of grafted cells  beneficially improving cardiac functions after AMI  The findings suggest that multiple doses of HCBMCs might be a novel strategy in the cell therapy for AMI ,
BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed improvement in heart function by injecting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells  BMSCs  after AMI  Emerging evidence suggested that both the number and function of BMSCs decline with ageing  We designed a randomized  controlled trial to further investigate the safety and efficacy of this treatment  METHODS: Patients with ST-elevation AMI undergoing successful reperfusion treatment within 12hours were randomly assigned to receive an intracoronary infusion of BMSCs  n=21  or standard medical treatment  n=22   the numbers of patients were limited because of the complication of coronary artery obstruction   RESULTS: There is a closely positive correlation of the number and function of BMSCs vs  the cardiac function reflected by LVEF at baseline  r=0 679  P=0 001  and at 12-month follow-up  r=0 477  P=0 039   Six months after cell administration  myocardial viability within the infarct area by 18-FDG SPECT was improved in both groups compared with baseline  but no significant difference in the BMSCs compared with control groups  4 0ñ0 4  95 CI 3 1-4 9 vs  3 2ñ0 5  95 CI 2 1-4 3  P=0 237   99mTc-sestamibi SPECT demonstrated that myocardial perfusion within the infarct area in the BMSCs did not differ from the control group  4 4ñ0 5  95 CI 3 2-5 5 vs  3 9ñ0 6  95 CI 2 6-5 2  P=0 594   Similarly  LVEF after 12 and 24months follow-up did not show any difference between the two groups  In the BMSCs group  one patient suffered a serious complication of coronary artery occlusion during the BMSCs injection procedure  CONCLUSIONS: The clinical benefits of intracoronary injection of autologous BMSCs in acute STEMI patients need further investigation and reevaluation ,
Donor-specific immunological tolerance using high doses of bone marrow cells  BMCs  has been demonstrated in mixed chimerism-based tolerance induction protocols; however  the development of graft versus host disease remains a risk  Here  we demonstrate that the co-infusion of limited numbers of donor unfractionated BMCs with human amnion-derived multipotent progenitor cells  AMPs  7 days post-allograft transplantation facilitates macrochimerism induction and graft tolerance in a mouse skin transplantation model  AMPs + BMCs co-infusion with minimal conditioning led to stable  mixed  multilineage lymphoid and myeloid macrochimerism  deletion of donor-reactive T cells  expansion of CD4 +  CD25 +  Foxp3 +  regulatory T cells  Tregs   and long-term allograft survival   300 days   Based on these findings  we speculate that AMPs maybe a pro-tolerogenic cellular therapeutic that could have clinical efficacy for both solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplant applications ,
Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT  is an established treatment for multiple myeloma  MM   a plasma cell malignancy  In order to identify an improved pre-transplant conditioning regimen  we investigated the cytotoxicity of gemcitabine  Gem  and clofarabine  Clo  combinations toward MM cell lines and patient cell samples  A strong synergism of the two nucleoside analogs  when combined at their  IC10 concentrations  was observed  This synergism may be partly due to the observed Gem-mediated phosphorylation and activation of deoxycytidine kinase  resulting in enhanced phosphorylation of Gem and Clo  Their cytotoxicity correlated with a robust activation of the DNA damage response pathway  [Gem+Clo] decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential with a concomitant release of pro-apoptotic factors into the cytoplasm and nucleus  and activation of apoptosis  Exposure of MM cells to [Gem+Clo] also decreased the level of ribosomal RNA  rRNA   which might have resulted in nucleolar stress  as reported previously  and caused a p53-dependent cell death  A reduction  by  50   in the cytotoxicity of Gem and Clo was observed in the presence of pifithrin    a p53 inhibitor  Furthermore  MM cell lines with mutant p53 exhibited greater resistance to Gem and Clo  supporting a role for the p53 protein in these cytotoxic responses  Our results provide a rationale for clinical trials incorporating [Gem+Clo] combinations as part of conditioning therapy for high-risk MM patients undergoing HSCT ,
This study assessed the effect of KCNMA1 transfected bone marrow-mesenchymal stem cells  BM-MSCs  on the improvement of erectile function in diabetic rats  Sixty male Sprague-Dawley rats were injected with streptozotocin  STZ  and screened with apomorphine  APO  to establish diabetes mellitus-induced erectile dysfunction  DMED   DMED rats were randomly divided into four groups: rats in each group underwent intracavernous injection with either phosphate buffer solution  DMED+PBS   nontransfected MSCs  DMED+MSCs   empty vector transfected MSCs  DMED+null-MSCs  or KCNMA1 transfected MSCs  DMED+KCNMA1-MSCs   Before injection  high levels of KCNMA1 expression were confirmed in KCNMA1-MSCs using RT-PCR and Western blotting  The lentivirus transfected MSCs maintained their potential for multidirectional differentiation  Four weeks after injection  erectile function was ascertained by measuring intracavernous pressure  ICP   Penile tissues were collected for immunohistochemical analysis  The expression of KCNMA1 in the corpus cavernosum was increased  and the DMED+KCNMA1-MSCs group displayed a significant improvement of erectile function  We concluded that KCNMA1 was able to enhance the positive effect of MSCs in the treatment of diabetes-associated erectile dysfunction ,
This study assessed the safety and preliminary efficacy of escalated dose subcutaneous alemtuzumab in combination with rituximab in chronic lymphocytic leukemia  Twenty-eight patients with relapsed refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia were treated on four dosing cohorts of weekly rituximab at 375 mg m2 and alemtuzumab doses that started at 30 mg three times per week and escalated to weekly dosing over four weeks  culminating with 90 mg weekly  One dose limiting toxicity of a rituximab infusion reaction was seen on cohort 2  but the regimen was otherwise well tolerated without evidence of differential toxicity by cohort  The overall response rate by National Cancer Institute-Working Group criteria was 61   and the rate of complete bone marrow response was 43   most of whom were negative for minimal residual disease  The addition of CT scan evaluation per International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 criteria reduced the overall response rate to 14   Median overall survival was 35 months  with twelve patients able to proceed to stem cell transplantation  Pharmacokinetic studies showed that chronic lymphocytic leukemia involving  80  of the bone marrow at study start was associated with lower trough concentrations of alemtuzumab and rituximab  and that higher trough serum concentrations of alemtuzumab were associated with complete bone marrow clearance  We conclude that escalated subcutaneous doses of alemtuzumab given weekly are well-tolerated and result in excellent bone marrow clearance of chronic lymphocytic leukemia  facilitating patients proceeding to stem cell transplantation ,
BACKGROUND: People with Down syndrome  DS  are more susceptible to infections and autoimmune disease  but the molecular genetic basis for these immune defects remains undetermined  In this study  we tested whether increased expression of the chromosome 21 gene RCAN1 contributes to immune dysregulation  METHODS: We investigated the immune phenotype of a mouse model that overexpresses RCAN1  RCAN1 transgenic  TG  mice exhibit T cell abnormalities that bear a striking similarity to the abnormalities described in individuals with DS  RESULTS: RCAN1-TG mice display T cell developmental defects in the thymus and peripheral immune tissues  Thymic cellularity is reduced by substantial losses of mature CD4 and CD8 thymocytes and medullary epithelium  In peripheral immune organs T lymphocytes are reduced in number and exhibit reduced proliferative capacity and aberrant cytokine production  These T cell defects are stem cell intrinsic in that transfer of wild type bone marrow into RCAN1-TG recipients restored medullary thymic epithelium and T cell numbers in the thymus  spleen and lymph nodes  However  bone marrow transplantation failed to improve T cell function  suggesting an additional role for RCAN1 in the non-haemopoietic compartment  CONCLUSIONS: RCAN1 therefore facilitates T cell development and function  and when overexpressed  may contribute to immune dysfunction in DS ,
BACKGROUND: Effects of different sources of medical uncertainty on people s health-related cognitions  emotions  and decision making have yet to be systematically examined  PURPOSE: The aim of this study is to examine how uncertainties arising from different sources are associated with decision making regarding stem cell transplantation in Fanconi anemia  a rare  inherited bone marrow failure syndrome that typically presents during childhood  METHODS: Data were collected through a cross-sectional survey of 178 parents of 126 Fanconi anemia patients  RESULTS: Two distinct sources of uncertainty were associated with decision outcomes: probability was associated with a lower likelihood of choosing stem cell transplantation  and ambiguity due to conflicting expert opinions was associated with greater decision-making difficulty  Concern about transplantation may mediate these associations  CONCLUSIONS: Different sources of uncertainty have different effects on Fanconi anemia treatment decisions  which may be mediated by parents  emotional reactions  Further research is needed to elucidate these effects and help Fanconi anemia families cope with uncertainty ,
Context -Methods for plasma cell enrichment of bone marrow  BM  specimens can increase the sensitivity of fluorescence in situ hybridization  FISH  for detecting cytogenomic abnormalities  There are no published reports using these methods to evaluate high-risk cytogenomic abnormalities in patients with plasma cell neoplasms  PCNs  after therapy  Objective -To evaluate the utility of plasma cell enrichment combined with FISH for detection of high-risk cytogenomic abnormalities in patients with PCNs after therapy  Design -Twenty-eight patients with PCNs  of whom 22 received treatment  were included in this study  Plasma cells were enriched in BM aspirates by using a magnetic cell-sorting procedure to select CD138 +  cells  Probes were chosen to assess for del 17p13 TP53   del 13q14 RB1   1q21 CKS1B gain  IgH FGFR3  and IgH MAF  Clinicopathologic data were collected during clinical follow-up after plasma cell enrichment  Results -Plasma cells in nonenriched BM specimens ranged from 1  to 28   median  8   compared with 28  to 96   median  73   in enriched BM specimens  P    001   In a subset of treated patients in clinical remission  FISH detected high-risk cytogenomic abnormalities only in plasma cell-enriched samples  This approach also detected abnormalities in cases of solitary plasmacytoma and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance  Conclusions -Plasma cell enrichment of BM specimens increases FISH sensitivity for detecting high-risk cytogenomic abnormalities  particularly in treated patients  and these results  in combination with clinical follow-up data  can be of value to improve risk stratification and patient management ,
OBJECTIVE: Back pain associated with symptomatic disc degeneration is a common clinical condition  Intervertebral disc  IVD  cell apoptosis and senescence increase with aging and degeneration  Repopulating the IVD with cells that could produce and maintain extracellular matrix would be an alternative therapy to surgery  The objective of this study was to determine the potential of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells  hUCB-MSCs  as a novel cell source for disc repair  In this study  we intended to confirm the potential for hUCB-MSCs to differentiate and display a chondrocyte-like phenotype after culturing in micromass and after injection into the rabbit IVD explant culture  We also wanted to confirm hUCB-MSC survival after transplantation into the IVD explant culture  DESIGN: This study consisted of micromass cultures and in vitro rabbit IVD explant cultures to assess hUCB-MSC survival and differentiation to display chondrocyte-like phenotype  First  hUCB-MSCs were cultured in micromass and stained with Alcian blue dye  Second  to confirm cell survival  hUCB-MSCs were labeled with an infrared dye and a fluorescent dye before injection into whole rabbit IVD explants  host   IVD explants were then cultured for 4 wks  Cell survival was confirmed by two independent techniques: an imaging system detecting the infrared dye at the organ level and fluorescence microscopy detecting fluorescent dye at the cellular level  Cell viability was assessed by staining the explant with CellTracker green  a membrane-permeant tracer specific for live cells  Human type II collagen gene expression  from the graft  was assessed by polymerase chain reaction  RESULTS: We have shown that hUCB-MSCs cultured in micromass are stained blue with Alcian blue dye  which suggests that proteoglycan-rich extracellular matrix is produced  In the cultured rabbit IVD explants  hUCB-MSCs survived for at least 4 wks and expressed the human type II collagen gene  suggesting that the injected hUCB-MSCs are differentiating into a chondrocyte-like lineage  CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the abiity of hUBC-MSCs to survive and assume a chondrocyte-like phenotype when injected into the rabbit IVD  These data support the potential for hUBC-MSCs as a cell source for disc repair  Further measures of the host response to the injection and studies in animal models are needed before trials in humans ,
Mesenchymal stem stromal cells  MSCs  are promising potential candidates for the treatment of immunological diseases because of their immunosuppressive functions  However  the molecular mechanisms that mediate MSCs  immunosuppressive activity remain elusive  In this article  we report for the first time  to our knowledge  that secreted growth-regulated oncogene  GRO  chemokines  specifically GRO-   in human MSC-conditioned media have an effect on the differentiation and the function of human monocyte-derived dendritic cells  The monocyte-derived dendritic cells were driven toward a myeloid-derived suppressor cell  MDSC -like phenotype by the GRO chemokines  GRO- -treated MDSCs had a tolerogenic phenotype that was characterized by an increase in the secretion of IL-10 and IL-4  and a reduction in the production of IL-12 and IFN-   We have also shown that the mRNA expression levels of the arginase-1 and inducible NO synthase genes  which characterize MDSCs  were upregulated by GRO- -primed mouse bone marrow cells  In addition  the ability of GRO- -treated bone marrow-derived dendritic cells to stimulate the OVA-specific CD8 +  T  OT-1  cell proliferation and the cytokine production of IFN-  and TNF-  were significantly decreased in vivo  Our findings allow a greater understanding of how MDSCs can be generated and offer new perspectives to exploit the potential of MDSCs for alternative approaches to treat chronic inflammation and autoimmunity  as well as for the prevention of transplant rejection ,
Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  BM-MSCs  have been shown to attenuate ischemia reperfusion  IR  injury in the heart  brain and kidney  However  their exact roles in the liver remain to be defined  Our objective was to investigate the potential effects of BM-MSCs on a hepatic IR rat model during the first 24ÿh after reperfusion  a crucial period for hepatic IR damage formation  A rat model of normothermic partial hepatic ischemia was obtained by vascular clamping for 60ÿmin  BM-MSCs were transplanted via portal vein injection  Injury severity  oxidative stress response and apoptosis of liver cells were assessed at 2  6  12 and 24ÿh after reperfusion and cell transplantation was evaluated  At 12 and 24ÿh after reperfusion  rats transplanted with BM-MSCs had significantly lower serum levels of alanine aminotransferase  ALT  and serum aspartate aminotransferase  AST   fewer damaged liver tissues  higher superoxide dismutase  SOD  and glutathione peroxidase  GSH-Px  activities and lower malondialdehyde  MDA  levels compared to rats in the sham transplantation group  At 24ÿh after reperfusion  IR rats transplanted with BM-MSCs had significantly fewer apoptotic hepatocytes  higher levels of B-cell lymphomaÿ2  Bcl-2  protein  and lower levels of Bcl-2-associatedÿX  Bax  and caspase-3  Casp3  proteins compared to sham transplantation rats  In conclusion  BM-MSCs transplanted via the portal vein partially prevent hepatic IR injury by suppressing oxidative stress and inhibiting apoptosis during the first 24ÿh after reperfusion ,
Cryopreservation of tissue engineered bone  TEB   whilst maintaining its osteogenic ability  is imperative for large-scale clinical application  We previously reported a novel cell transplantation method  in which bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells  BMSCs  were cultured to confluence and differentiated down the osteogenic lineage to form osteogenic matrix cell sheets  OMCS   OMCS have high alkaline phosphatase  ALP  activity and osteocalcin  OC  contents and can be easily used for producing TEB  The aim of the present study was to investigate whether TEB produced by cryopreserved OMCS maintains sufficient osteogenic potential in vivo  OMCS were prepared and divided into three groups according to storage period of cryopreservation  fresh  no cryopreservation   4week and 12week cryopreservation groups   OMCS were cryopreserved by storage in freezing medium  Cell Banker 1?  at -80øC  Cryopreserved OMCSs were rapidly thawed at room temperature and wrapped around Hydroxyapatite  HA  scaffolds prior to implantation into subcutaneous sites in rats  to determine their in vivo bone-forming capability  The constructs were harvested 4weeks after transplantation and examined histologically and biochemically  Histological analysis of the constructs showed extensive bone formation in the HA pores with high ALP activity and OC content detected in the cryopreservation groups  The present study clearly indicates that cryopreserved thawed OMCS are still capable of producing mineralized matrix on scaffolds  resulting in bone formation  This cryopreservation technique could be applied for hard tissue reconstruction to ease the cell preparation method prior to time of use ,
Osteoarthritis  OA  is a common rheumatic disease associated with imbalanced cartilage homeostasis which could be corrected by mesenchymal stem cells  MSCs  therapy  However  MSCs from different origins might exhibit distinct differentiation capacities  This study was undertaken to compare the therapeutic efficacies between MSCs from cord blood  CB-MSCs  and bone marrow  BM-MSCs  on OA treatment  The surface phenotypes and multipotent capacities of CB-MSCs and BM-MSCs were first characterized  The coculture commitment system was subsequently utilized for comparing the patterned molecules in stage-specific chondrogenesis of committed MSCs  For examining the therapeutic efficacies  committed CB-MSCs and BM-MSCs were encapsulated in neo-cartilage and subjected into pro-inflammatory cytokine environment  Finally  chondrogenic and inflammatory cytokine profiles in committed MSCs were evaluated  CB-MSCs and BM-MSCs were both negative for hematopoietic markers and positive for adhesion and mesenchymal cell markers  The CB-MSCs showed a markedly higher chondrogenic potential and relatively lower osteogenic and adipogenic capacities than BM-MSCs  During chondrogenesis  the committed CB-MSCs also showed significant increases in cell proliferation  adhesion molecules  signaling molecules  and chondrogenic-specific gene expressions in aÿcoculture system  For the therapeutic efficacies  the committed CB-MSCs could strongly recover the pro-inflammatory cytokines diminished-Col II and proteoglycan expressions in aÿ3D arthritic model  The IL-10  ICAM-1 and TGF- 1 were also up-regulated in committed CB-MSCs analyzed by using cytokine profiling  Our data demonstrate that CB-MSCs possess specific advantages in cartilage regeneration over BM-MSCs  The CB-MSCs showed a better therapeutic potential that can contribute to advanced cell-based transplantation for clinical OA therapy ,
The present study provides evidence that transplantation of hypoxic MSCs may be a promising therapy for the treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures ,
In a well-controlled multi-center randomized trial in southwestern China  228 patients with refractory or relapsed AML were received a low-dose CAG regimen either with etoposide  E-CAG  or without etoposide  CAG   The complete remission  CR  rate  overall survival  OS  and toxicity were evaluated  Patients with E-CAG had a higher CR rate  71 1  vs  CAG 50 9   P=0 0002   The tolerability appeared to be equivalent  Patients with CR who underwent allogenic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  allo-HSCT  had a higher five-year OS over those without allo-HSCT  73 8  vs  10 8   P=0 000   The E-CAG regimen is expected to become a bridge between relapsed or refractory AML and allo-HSCT ,
Mesenchymal stem cells  MSCs  have been reported to preserve renal function in various models of acute kidney injury  AKI   Different routes were used to transplant MSCs but the role of cell transplantation routes in directing outcomes has been unknown  In the present study  we evaluated organ bio-distributions of transplanted MSCs  and correlated survival of transplanted cells with outcomes in mice with cisplatinum-induced AKI  We found that after intravenous administration  MSCs were largely localized in pulmonary capillaries and only a minute fraction of MSCs entered kidneys and the cells survived only transiently  Therefore  we also transplanted MSCs via intraperitoneal and renal subcapsular routes  Transplanted MSCs survived longer in peritoneal cavity and renal subcapsular space  Interestingly  when MSC transplantation was followed by cisplatinum-induced AKI  renal morphology and renal functions were better preserved  irrespective of the cell transplantation route  As transplanted MSCs did not migrate to kidneys from either peritoneal cavity or renal subcapsular space  this finding suggested that migration of cells was not required for the beneficial response  The possibility of indirect mechanisms was confirmed when administration of the conditioned medium from MSCs also protected renal tubular cells from cisplatinum-induced cytotoxicity  We identified presence of over forty regulatory cytokines in the conditioned medium obtained from MSCs  Since paracrine factors released by transplanted cells accounted for improvements  it appears that the route of cell transplantation is not critical for realizing benefits of cell therapy with MSCs in AKI  Studies of specific cytokines secreted by MSCs will help to obtain new therapeutic mechanisms for renal protection ,
Based on a porcine model with surgically created myocardial infarction  MI  as a pre-clinical scheme  this study investigates the clinical translation of cell sheet fragments of autologous mesenchymal stem cells  MSCs  for cellular cardiomyoplasty  MSC sheet fragments retaining endogenous extracellular matrices are fabricated using a thermo-responsive methylcellulose hydrogel system  Echocardiographic observations indicate that transplantation of MSC sheet fragments in infarcted hearts can markedly attenuate the adverse ventricular dilation and preserve the cardiac function post MI  which is in contrast to the controlled groups receiving saline or dissociated MSCs  Additionally  histological analyses suggest that administering MSC sheet fragments significantly prevents the scar expansion and left ventricle remodeling after MI  Immunohistochemistry results demonstrate that the engrafted MSCs can differentiate into endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells  implying that angiogenesis and the subsequent regional perfusion improvement is a promising mechanism for ameliorating post-infarcted cardiac function  However  according to the data recorded by an implantable loop recorder  the transplanted MSCs may provoke arrhythmia  Nevertheless  the proposed approach may potentially lead to the eventual translation of MSC-based therapy into practical and effective clinical treatments ,
The effect of azacitidine  AZA  in therapy related MDS and AML  t-MDS AML  is not well established  54 patients  42 t-MDS and 12 t-AML   71  of whom had complex karyotype  received AZA for at least one cycle  median 4 cycles   The overall response rate  ORR  was 39  in the whole cohort and 62  in patients who received  4 cycles  One  2 and 3 year OS was 36   14  and 8  respectively  Female gender  p=0 01  and ECOG 0-1  p=0 04  were associated with significantly better OS  while karyotype and marrow blast percentage had no significant impact  By comparison with de novo MDS AML treated in the same program  t-MDS AML had a similar response rate  38  vs 45  in de novo MDS AML  p=0 53   but significantly shorter OS  2 year OS of 14  vs 33 9   p=0 0005   However  in a multivariate analysis performed in all patients  de novo and therapy related cases   only complex karyotype and high IPSS  and not etiology  i e  de novo versus therapy related   had a significant impact on OS  Nine  15   patients received allogeneic stem cell transplantation  4 of whom were still alive ,
Human blood-derived CD133 +  cell populations  which are believed to represent a hematopoietic endothelial progenitor fraction  have the ability to promote the repair of injured spinal cord in animal models  However  the mechanisms by which CD133 +  cell transplantation promotes spinal cord regeneration remain to be clarified  Another possible hurdle on the way to clinical applicability of these cells is their scarce representation in the overall population of mononuclear cells  We therefore analyzed and compared ex-vivo expanded human cord blood derived CD133 +  cells with freshly isolated CD133 +  cells as well as corresponding CD133 -  control mononuclear cells in respect to their ability to promote spinal cord repair using in vitro assays and cell transplantation into a mouse spinal cord injury model  In vitro  expanded cells as well as fresh CD133 +  cells formed endothelial progenitor cell  EPC  colonies  whereas CD133 -  cells formed no EPC colonies  In vivo  the administration of fresh CD133 +  and expanded cells enhanced angiogenesis  astrogliosis  axon growth and functional recovery after injury  In contrast  the administration of CD133 -  cells failed to promote axon growth and functional recovery  but moderately enhanced angiogenesis and astrogliosis  In addition  high-dose administration of expanded cells was highly effective in the induction of regenerative processes at the injured spinal cord ,
Interferon-   IFN   is an effective treatment of patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms  MPNs   In addition to inducing hematological responses in most MPN patients  IFN  reduces the JAK2V617F allelic burden and can render the JAK2V617F mutant clone undetectable in some patients  The precise mechanism underlying these responses is incompletely understood and whether the molecular responses that are seen occur due to the effects of IFN  on JAK2V617F mutant stem cells is debated  Using a murine model of Jak2V617F MPN  we investigated the effects of IFN  on Jak2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells in vivo  We report that IFN  treatment induces hematological responses in the model and causes depletion of Jak2V617F MPN-propagating cells over time  impairing disease transplantation  We demonstrate that IFN  treatment induces cell cycle activation of Jak2V617F mutant long-term hematopoietic stem cells and promotes a predetermined erythroid-lineage differentiation program  These findings provide insights into the differential effects of IFN  on Jak2V617F mutant and normal hematopoiesis and suggest that IFN  achieves molecular remissions in MPN patients through its effects on MPN stem cells  Furthermore  these results support combinatorial therapeutic approaches in MPN by concurrently depleting dormant JAK2V617F MPN-propagating stem cells with IFN  and targeting the proliferating downstream progeny with JAK2 inhibitors or cytotoxic chemotherapy ,
We describe a rare case of fatal mumps encephalomyelitis occurring in 19-year old male following matched unrelated donor peripheral blood haematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT   The indication for HSCT was for an undefined form of severe combined immunodeficiency  SCID   Molecular typing of the mumps viral RNA isolated from neural tissue indicated that the infection was acquired at the time of a mumps outbreak in England and Wales that occurred between 2004 and 2006  This case highlights the importance of considering mumps in the differential diagnosis of central nervous system infection in highly immunosuppressed patients ,
Therapeutic approaches for CKD  chronic kidney disease  have been able to reduce proteinuria  but not diminish the disease progression  We have demonstrated beneficial effects by injection of BM  bone marrow -derived MSCs  mesenchymal stem cells  from healthy donors in a rat model with CKD  However  it has recently been reported that BM-MSCs derived from uraemic patients failed to confer functional protection in a similar model  This suggests that autologous BM-MSCs are not suitable for the treatment of CKD  In the present study  we have explored the potential of MSCs derived from adipose tissue  AD-MSCs  as an alternative source of MSCs for the treatment of CKD  We have isolated AD-MSCs and evaluated their effect on the progression of CKD  Adult male SD  Sprague-Dawley  rats subjected to 5 6 NPX  nephrectomy  received a single intravenous infusion of 0 5?106 AD-MSCs or MSC culture medium alone  The therapeutic effect was evaluated by plasma creatinine measurement  structural analysis and angiogenic epitheliogenic protein expression  AD-MSCs were detected in kidney tissues from NPX animals  This group had a significant reduction in plasma creatinine levels and a lower expression of damage markers ED-1 and  -SMA   -smooth muscle actin   P 0 05   In addition  treated rats exhibited a higher level of epitheliogenic [Pax-2 and BMP-7  bone morphogenetic protein 7 ] and angiogenic [VEGF  vascular endothelial growth factor ] proteins  The expression of these biomarkers of regeneration was significantly related to the improvement in renal function  Although many aspects of the cell therapy for CKD remain to be investigated  we provide evidence that AD-MSCs  a less invasive and highly available source of MSCs  exert an important therapeutic effect in this pathology ,
Despite aggressive chemotherapy combined with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  HSCT   many patients with acute myeloid leukemia  AML  relapse  Radioimmunotherapy  RIT  using monoclonal antibodies labeled with  -emitting radionuclides has been explored to reduce relapse    emitters are limited by lower energies and nonspecific cytotoxicity from longer path lengths compared with   emitters such as  211 At  which has a higher energy profile and shorter path length  We evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of anti-CD45 RIT using  211 At in a disseminated murine AML model  Biodistribution studies in leukemic SJL J mice showed excellent localization of  211 At-anti-murine CD45 mAb  30F11  to marrow and spleen within 24 hours  18  and 79  injected dose per gram of tissue [ID g]  respectively   with lower kidney and lung uptake  8 4  and 14  ID g  respectively   In syngeneic HSCT studies   211 At-B10-30F11 RIT improved the median survival of leukemic mice in a dose-dependent fashion  123  101  61  and 37 days given 24  20  12  and 0 æCi  respectively   This approach had minimal toxicity with nadir white blood cell counts  2 7 K æL 2 weeks after HSCT and recovery by 4 weeks  These data suggest that  211 At-anti-CD45 RIT in conjunction with HSCT may be a promising therapeutic option for AML ,
Over a decade ago  several preclinical transplantation studies suggested the striking concept of the tissue-reconstituting ability  often referred to as HSC plasticity  of hematopoietic stem cells  HSCs   While this heralded an exciting time of radically new therapies for disorders of many organs and tissues  the concept was soon mired in controversy and remained dormant for almost a decade  This commentary provides a concise review of evidence for HSC plasticity  including more recent findings based on single HSC transplantation in mouse and clinical transplantation studies  There is strong evidence for the concept that HSCs are pluripotent and are the source for the majority  if not all  of the cell types in our body  Also discussed are some biological and experimental issues that need to be considered in the future investigation of HSC plasticity ,
Protocols to use Foxp3+ T-regulatory  Treg  cells for cellular therapy  especially postallogeneic stem cell transplantation  are currently being developed and tested by various groups  Inhibitors of DNA methyltransferase  Dnmt  enzymes have been advocated as a means to promote and stabilize Foxp3 expression in Tregs undergoing expansion in vitro before their injection in vivo  We investigated the effects of conditionally deleting two Dnmt enzymes that co-immunoprecipitated with Foxp3 in Treg isolates  Deletion of Dnmt1  but not Dnmt3a  decreased the numbers and function of peripheral Tregs and impaired conversion of conventional T cells into Foxp3+ Tregs under polarizing conditions  Importantly  mice with conditional deletion of Dnmt1 in their Tregs died of autoimmunity by 3 to 4 weeks of age unless they were rescued by perinatal transfer of wild-type Tregs  Conditional Dnmt1 deletion did not affect methylation of CpG sites within Foxp3 but decreased global DNA methylation and altered Treg expression of several hundred pro-inflammatory and other genes  Hence  Dnmt1 is necessary for maintenance of the core gene program underlying Treg development and function  and its deletion within the Treg lineage leads to lethal autoimmunity  These data suggest that caution may be warranted when considering the use of DNMT inhibitors in development of Treg-based cellular therapies ,
Expanded BM-MSCs procured from ESRD patients and healthy controls are both phenotypically and functionally similar  These findings are important for the potential autologous clinical application of BM-MSCs in transplant recipients ,
Our results show that infused hESC-MPs may promote recovery from AKI by regulating related cytokines ,
Competing risks endpoints are frequently encountered in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation where patients are exposed to relapse and treatment-related mortality  Both cause-specific hazards and direct models for the cumulative incidence functions have been used for analyzing such competing risks endpoints  For both approaches  the popular models are of a proportional hazards type  Such models have been used for studying prognostic factors in acute and chronic leukemias  We argue that a complete understanding of the event dynamics requires that both hazards and cumulative incidence be analyzed side by side  and that this is generally the most rigorous scientific approach to analyzing competing risks data  That is  understanding the effects of covariates on cause-specific hazards and cumulative incidence functions go hand in hand  A case study illustrates our proposal ,
Autogenic and allogenic bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells  BM-MSCs  were compared for repair of bone gap defect in rabbits  BM-MSCs were isolated from bone marrow aspirates and cultured in vitro for allogenic and autogenic transplantation  A 5mm segmental defect was created in mid-diaphysis of the radius bone  The defect was filled with hydroxyapatite alone  hydroxyapatite with autogeneic BM-MSCs and hydroxyapatite with allogenic BM-MSCs in groups A  B and C  respectively  On an average 3 45?10 6  cells were implanted at each defect site  Complete bridging of bone gap with newly formed bone was faster in both treatment groups as compared to control group  Histologically  increased osteogenesis  early and better reorganization of cancellous bone and more bone marrow formation were discernible in treatment groups as compared to control group  It was concluded that in vitro culture expanded allogenic and autogenic BM-MSCs induce similar  but faster and better healing as compared to control ,
Suitable colonization and vascularization of tissue-engineered constructs after transplantation represent critical steps for the success of bone repair  Human platelet lysate  hPL  is composed of numerous growth factors known for their proliferative  differentiative and chemo-attractant effects on various cells involved in wound healing and bone growth  The aim of this study was to determine whether the delivery of human mesenchymal stromal cells  hMSC  seeded on hPL-coated hydroxyapatite  -tricalcium phosphate  HA  -TCP  scaffolds could enhance vascularization and bone formation  as well as to investigate the mechanisms by which hMSC participate in tissue regeneration  Our study demonstrates that hPL can be coated on HA  -TCP scaffolds  which play direct and indirect effects on implanted and or resident stem cells  Effectively  we show that hPL coating directly increases chemo-attraction to and adhesion of hMSC and endothelial cells on the scaffold  Moreover  we show that hPL coating induces hMSC to produce and secrete pro-angiogenic proteins  placental growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor  which allow the proliferation and specific chemo-attraction of endothelial cells in vitro  thus improving in vivo neovascularization and new bone formation  This study highlights the potential of functionalizing biomaterials with hPL and shows that this growth factor combination can have synergistic effects leading to enhanced bone and blood vessel formation ,
The role of G-MSCs in controlling the development and severity of CIA mostly depends on CD39 CD73 signals and partially depends on the induction of CD4+CD39+FoxP3+ Treg cells  G-MSCs provide a promising approach for the treatment of autoimmune diseases ,
To assess current clinical practice in diagnosis and treatment of acute graft-versus-host disease  aGVHD   we performed a survey among German  Austrian  and Swiss allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  allo-HSCT  centers  Thirty-four of 72 contacted centers  47   completed both the diagnostic and therapeutic sections of the survey  representing 65  of allo-HSCT activity within the participating countries in 2011  Three pediatric centers answered as requested only the diagnostic part of the survey  In the presence of diarrhea and decreased oral intake after engraftment  only 4 centers  12   do not perform any endoscopy before the start of immunosuppressive treatment  In case of a skin rash with the differential diagnosis of drug reaction  only 12 centers  35   perform a skin biopsy up front  whereas 19 do so after failure of systemic steroids  In the presence of rapidly increasing cholestasis occurring without any other signs of aGVHD  11 centers  32   perform a liver biopsy up front and 14 only after failure of steroid treatment  whereas 9 centers do not perform a liver biopsy at all  Twenty centers  59   use a percutaneous approach  12 a transvenous approach  and 1 mini-laparoscopy for liver biopsies  First-line treatment of cutaneous aGVHD stage 1 consists of topical treatment alone in 17 of 31 responding centers  61    whereas isolated cutaneous aGVHD stage III is treated with systemic steroids  prednisolone below 0 5 mg kg day nÿ=ÿ2  0 5 to 1 0 mg kg day nÿ=ÿ10  above 1 0 to 2 5 mg kg day nÿ=ÿ19  without or with topical agents  steroids nÿ=ÿ10; calcineurin inhibitors nÿ=ÿ3   In gastrointestinal manifestations of aGVHD  9 centers  29   add topical to systemic steroids  and 3 consider topical steroids as the only treatment for mild gastrointestinal and cutaneous aGVHD  The choice of agent for second-line treatment as well as the sequence of administration are extremely heterogeneous  most likely due to a lack of convincing data published  Most frequently used are mycophenolate mofetil  nÿ=ÿ14  and extracorporeal photopheresis  nÿ=ÿ10   Our survey also demonstrates that clinicians chose salvage therapies for steroid-refractory aGVHD based on their centers  own clinical experience ,
Myeloid-derived suppressor cells  MDSCs  are a group of myeloid cells composed of hematopoietic progenitor cells  immature macrophages  dendritic cells  and granulocytes  which accumulate in inflammatory diseases and various cancers  Here  we investigated the dynamic changes and effects of MDSCs in graft-versus-host disease  GVHD  development and or tumor relapse after syngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow transplantation  BMT   We found that adding functional MDSCs in donor graft alleviated GVHD  whereas removal of MDSCs inÿvivo exacerbated GVHD  After T cell-deplete BMT  MDSCs transiently accumulated in the blood and spleen of recipients without GVHD  In contrast  after T cell-replete BMT  the levels of blood MDSCs were constantly elevated in recipients with GVHD  MDSC accumulation positively correlated with the severity of GVHD  Additionally  MDSC accumulation was further increased upon tumor relapse  Although MDSCs isolated from both syngeneic and allogeneic BMT recipients inhibited T cell proliferation in response to alloantigen stimulation exÿvivo  MDSCs from the recipients with GVHD showed much higher suppressive potency compared with those from recipients without GVHD  These results indicate that MDSCs can regulate the immune response in acute GVHD  and possibly tumor relapse  subsequent to allogeneic BMT ,
Bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells  BM-MSCs  have been widely applied in several clinical trials of diseases  such as myocardial infarction  liver cirrhosis  neurodegenerative disease  and osteogenesis imperfecta  Although most studies demonstrated that transplantation of BM-MSCs did exert a temporary relief and short-term therapeutic effects  eventually all symptoms recur  therefore it is essential to improve the therapeutic efficacy of transplantation by either elevating the self-renewal of BM-MSCs or enhancing their survival rate  Herein we demonstrated that the BM-MSCs and adipocyte derived mesenchymal stem cells  ADSCs  isolated from the androgen receptor  AR  knockout mice have higher self-renewal ability than those obtained from the wild-type mice  Knockdown of AR in MSC cell lines exhibited similar results  Mechanistic dissection studies showed that the depletion of AR resulted in activation of Erk and Akt signaling pathways through epidermal growth factor receptor  EGFR  activation or pathway to mediate higher self-renewal of BM-MSCs  Targeting AR signals using ASC-J9?  an AR degradation enhancer   hydroxyflutamide  antagonist of AR   and AR-siRNA all led to enhanced self-renewal of MSCs  suggesting the future possibility of using these anti-AR agents in therapeutic approaches ,
Gene therapy has proven its potential to cure diseases of the hematopoietic system  but potential adverse reactions related to insertional mutagenesis by integrating gene vectors and chromosomal instability in long-lived repopulating cells have emerged as a major limitation  Preclinical gene therapy in murine models is a powerful model for assessment of gene marking efficiency and adverse reactions  However  changes in the hematologic composition after transplantation with retrovirally modified hematopoietic stem cells have not been well investigated in large cohorts of animals by systematic cytological analyses  In the present study  cytological analyses of bone marrow and spleen were performed in a large cohort  n = 58  of C57BL 6J mice over an extended observation period after gene marking  Interestingly  we observed hematological malignancies in four out of 30 animals transplanted with dLNGFR  truncated form of the human p75 low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor  and tCD34 modified stem progenitor cells  Our data demonstrate that cytological analysis provides important information for diagnosis of hematological disorders and thus should be included in preclinical studies and performed in each investigated animal  Together with histological analysis  flow cytometric analysis  and other analyses  the quality and predictive value of preclinical gene therapy studies will be improved ,
Tissue engineering and cell implantation therapies are gaining popularity because of their potential to repair and regenerate tissues and organs  To investigate the role of inflammatory cytokines in new tissue development in engineered tissues  we have characterized the nature and timing of cell populations forming new adipose tissue in a mouse tissue engineering chamber  TEC  and characterized the gene and protein expression of cytokines in the newly developing tissues  EGFP-labeled bone marrow transplant mice and MacGreen mice were implanted with TEC for periods ranging from 0 5 days to 6 weeks  Tissues were collected at various time points and assessed for cytokine expression through ELISA and mRNA analysis or labeled for specific cell populations in the TEC  Macrophage-derived factors  such as monocyte chemotactic protein-1  MCP-1   appear to induce adipogenesis by recruiting macrophages and bone marrow-derived precursor cells to the TEC at early time points  with a second wave of nonbone marrow-derived progenitors  Gene expression analysis suggests that TNF   LCN-2  and Interleukin 1  are important in early stages of neo-adipogenesis  Increasing platelet-derived growth factor and vascular endothelial cell growth factor expression at early time points correlates with preadipocyte proliferation and induction of angiogenesis  This study provides new information about key elements that are involved in early development of new adipose tissue ,
Mucormycosis has a high mortality and is increasingly diagnosed in hematopoietic stem cell transplant  HSCT  recipients  In this setting  there is a growing interest to restore host defense to combat infections by adoptively transferring donor-derived immunocompetent cells  Natural killer  NK  cells exhibit antitumor and antiinfective activity  but the interaction with Mucormycetes is unknown  Our data demonstrate that both unstimulated and IL-2 prestimulated human NK cells damage Rhizopus oryzae hyphae  but do not affect resting conidia  The damage of the fungus is mediated  at least in part  by perforin  R  oryzae hyphae decrease the secretion of immunoregulatory molecules by NK cells  such as IFN-  and RANTES  indicating an immunosuppressive effect of the fungus  Our data indicate that NK cells exhibit activity against Mucormycetes and future research should evaluate NK cells as a potential tool for adoptive immunotherapy in HSCT ,
The differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells  MSCs  into type II alveolar epithelial  AT II  cells in vivo and in vitro  is critical for reepithelization and recovery in acute lung injury  ALI   but the mechanisms responsible for differentiation are unclear  In the present study  we investigated the role of the canonical wnt pathway in the differentiation of mouse bone marrow-derived MSCs  mMSCs  into AT II cells  Using a modified co-culture system with murine lung epithelial-12  MLE-12  cells and small airway growth media  SAGM  to efficiently drive mMSCs differentiation  we found that GSK 3  and  -catenin in the canonical wnt pathway were up-regulated during differentiation  The levels of surfactant protein  SP  C  SPB  and SPD  the specific markers of AT II cells  correspondingly increased in mMSCs when Wnt3a or LiCl was added to the co-culture system to activate wnt  -catenin signaling  The expression of these factors was depressed to some extent by inhibiting the pathway with the addition of DKK 1  The differentiation rate of mMSCs also depends on their abilities to accumulate and survive in inflammatory tissue  Our results suggested that the activation of wnt  -catenin signaling promoted mMSCs migration towards ALI mouse-derived lung tissue in a Transwell assay  and ameliorated the cell death and the reduction of Bcl-2 Bax induced by H 2  O 2   which simultaneously caused reduced GSK 3  and  -catenin in mMSCs  These data supports a potential mechanism for the differentiation of mMSCs into AT II cells involving canonical wnt pathway activation  which may be significant to their application in ALI ,
Bone marrow is one of the best characterized stem cell microenvironment that contains Mesenchymal Stem Cells  MSCs   MSCs have been indicated as a new option for regenerative medicine because of their ability to differentiate into bone  cartilage and adipose tissues  However  in vitro-cultivation of MSCs could be associated with some shortcomings such as the possibility of the de-differentiation or reprogramming of the cells and the increase of the risk of infection and contaminations  To overcome these problems  a new approach is represented by the use of Bone Marrow Concentrate  BMC   This enables the implant of a cell population surrounded by its microenvironment preventing all the complications related to the in vitro-culture  Moreover  the cells within the bone marrow niche are able to regulate stem cell behavior through direct physical contact and by secreting paracrine factors  The aim of this study was to investigate the phenotype of cells within BMC and their ability to differentiate into chondrogenic lineage once seeded onto a hyaluronan-based scaffold  Hyaff-11  already used in clinic  The chondrogenic potential of BMC has been evaluated by means of morphological  histological  immunohistochemical and molecular analyses  The data obtained with the current study demonstrated that cells within BMC grown onto HYAFF-11 are able to differentiate into chondrogenic sense by the expression and production of specific extracellular molecules  These findings support the use of BMC in clinic for the repair of cartilage lesions allowing its transplantation in a  One Step  procedure  ? 2012 Wiley Periodicals  Inc  J Biomed Mater Res Part A  2013 ,
We conclude that rat bmECFCs promote ischemic tissue reperfusion and their proangiogenic properties are a potential mechanism for this effect ,
