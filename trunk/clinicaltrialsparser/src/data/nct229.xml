  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, observational study that includes both prospective and
      retrospective chart reviews at major institutions across Canada. The intent of the study is
      to generate both regional and national incidence data for non-Candida invasive fungal
      infections (IFI) in high risk subjects. The study will include participants receiving stem
      cell transplant and high dose chemotherapy treatment for leukemia.

    <description>Participants will be considered high-risk if they are undergoing chemotherapy for leukemia. This includes, but is not limited to participants with acute myelogenous leukemia, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, or myelodysplastic syndrome. Participants are also considered to be at high risk for IFI if they have undergone allogeneic hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation.</description>
