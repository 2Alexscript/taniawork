      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies yoga therapy in treating patients with malignant brain
      tumors.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To estimate the participation rate, accrual, adherence, and retention
      to a yoga trial in patients with malignant brain tumors. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To obtain
      estimates of the variability of self-reported fatigue,  distress (i.e., depression,
      anxiety), sleep disturbance, cognitive function, and health-related quality of life from
      baseline to the end of the intervention at 6 (post-onsite intervention) and 12 weeks
      (post-full intervention). II. To obtain preliminary estimates of the efficacy of a yoga
      intervention in patients with malignant brain tumors on the outcomes of fatigue, distress,
      and cognitive function. III. To standardize the cancer-specific yoga protocol for use with
      brain tumor patients. OUTLINE: Patients participate in yoga classes comprising postures,
      deep relaxation, breathing practices, and meditation twice a week for 75 minutes during
      weeks 1-6. Patients then practice yoga at home twice a week for 45 minutes during weeks
      7-12. After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 4-5
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed protocol specific informed consent

          -  Are diagnosed with a Malignant Brain Tumor (Grades II-IV)

          -  Able to start the on-site yoga intervention within 1 week of first radiation
             treatment

          -  Are physically able to attend the intervention classes (ECOG performance status
             rating 0-2)

          -  Able to understand written and spoken English

          -  Have no medical contraindications reported by the attending physician

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have practiced yoga on a regular basis (at least once a week) within the past 4 weeks
             to recruit participants who are not already regularly practicing yoga; given that the
             benefits of yoga are likely more immediate than long-term, however, we will enroll
             participants who have previously had a yoga practice
