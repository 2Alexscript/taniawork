      This phase II trial studies how well giving sirolimus together with cyclosporine and
      mycophenolate mofetil works in preventing graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in patients with
      hematologic malignancies undergoing donor peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant.
      Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune
      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are
      infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood
      cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can
      make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving total-body irradiation
      together with sirolimus, cyclosporine, and mycophenolate mofetil before and after transplant
      may stop this from happening

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether the incidence of acute GVHD grades II-IV can be reduced to less than
      50% with the triple-immunosuppressant combination of cyclosporine (CSP)/mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF) with sirolimus in human leukocyte antigens (HLA) class I or class II
      mismatched related or unrelated donor hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) using
      nonmyeloablative conditioning.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the incidence of non-relapse mortality before day 100. II. To evaluate the
      incidences of grades III-IV acute GVHD.

      OUTLINE:

      CONDITIONING: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on
      days -4 to -2. Patients also undergo total-body irradiation on day 0.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.

      IMMUNOSUPPRESSION: Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days -3 to 180
      with taper to day 365; cyclosporine PO twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 150 with taper to day
      180; and mycophenolate mofetil PO thrice daily (TID) on days 0-30 and then BID to day 100
      with taper to day 150.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 5 years.

          -  DONOR: Related or unrelated volunteer donors who are mismatched with the recipient
             within one of the following limitations: a) mismatch for one HLA class I antigen with
             or without an additional mismatch for one HLA-class I allele, but matched for
             HLA-DRB1 and HLA-DQ, OR

          -  DONOR: b) mismatched for two HLA class I alleles, but matched for HLA-DRB1 and
             HLA-DQ, OR

          -  DONOR: c) mismatched for one HLA-DRB1 antigen or allele with or without an additional
             mismatch for one HLA-DQ, but matched for HLA-class I alleles

          -  DONOR: HLA-matching must be based on results of high resolution typing at HLA-A, -B,
             -C, -DRB1, and -DQB

          -  DONOR: Two mismatches at a single HLA- locus is not allowed

          -  DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would
             jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the
             standard practice of the individual institution; the donor should be excluded if any
             of the flow cytometric B and T cell cytotoxic cross match assays are positive

          -  DONOR: Only G-CSF mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a hematopoietic stem cell
             (HSC) source on this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who are homozygous at the mismatched major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
             class I locus or II locus

          -  Patients for whom the best available donor is mismatched at both HLA class I and
             class II

          -  A positive cross-match exists between the donor and recipient

          -  Patients with rapidly progressive intermediate or high grade NHL

             standard pathology for patients with AML, MDS, ALL or CML

             chemotherapy

          -  Patients with active non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers)
             or those with non-hematologic malignancies (except non-melanoma skin cancers) who
             have been rendered with no evidence of disease, but have a greater than 20% chance of
             having disease recurrence within 5 years

          -  Fungal infections with radiological progression after receipt of amphotericin B or
             active triazole for greater than 1 month

          -  Patients with active bacterial or fungal infections unresponsive to medical therapy

             (TLC) &lt; 40%, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) &lt; 40% and/or receiving
             supplementary continuous oxygen

          -  The FHCRC PI of the study must approve of enrollment of all patients with pulmonary
             nodules

          -  Patients with clinical or laboratory evidence of liver disease would be evaluated for
             the cause of liver disease, its clinical severity in terms of liver function, and the
             degree of portal hypertension; patients will be excluded if they are found to have
             fulminant liver failure, cirrhosis of the liver with evidence of portal hypertension,
             alcoholic hepatitis, esophageal varices, a history of bleeding esophageal varices,
             hepatic encephalopathy, uncorrectable hepatic synthetic dysfunction evinced by
             prolongation of the prothrombin time, ascites related to portal hypertension,
             bridging fibrosis, bacterial or fungal liver abscess, biliary obstruction, chronic
             viral hepatitis with total serum bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dL, or symptomatic biliary disease

          -  Patients with poorly controlled hypertension on multiple antihypertensives

          -  Karnofsky scores &lt; 60 or Lansky Score &lt; 50

          -  All patients receiving antifungal therapy voriconazole, posaconazole, or fluconazole
             must have sirolimus reduced according to the Standard Practice Antifungal Therapy
             Guidelines

          -  The addition of cytotoxic agents for &quot;cytoreduction&quot; with the exception of tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib), cytokine therapy, hydroxyurea, low dose
             cytarabine, chlorambucil, or rituxan will not be allowed within three weeks of the
             initiation of conditioning

          -  DONOR: Donor (or centers) who will exclusively donate marrow

          -  DONOR: Donors who are HIV-positive and/or, medical conditions that would result in
             increased risk for G-CSF mobilization and harvest of PBSC
