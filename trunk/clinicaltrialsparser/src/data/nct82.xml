  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is the second most common solid tumor seen in children, but causes
      approximately 15% of childhood cancer deaths each year. Patients with high-risk disease
      require treatment with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, radiation, and stem cell
      transplant; however, many will have their disease come back within 3 years. Due to this high
      rate of relapse, this study is being done to investigate an experimental treatment option
      for children whose disease has returned.

      This clinical trial is for patients with neuroblastoma that has either come back after
      treatment or never went away in the first place. A series of immunizations will be
      administered using a tumor vaccine and add low-dose chemotherapy to be taken by mouth on a
      daily basis.  The hope is that the vaccine will cause the immune system to recognize and
      kill more types of neuroblastoma tumors. Additionally, the immunizations will be combined
      with daily low dose chemotherapy. Daily low-dose chemotherapy, also know as metronomic
      chemotherapy, works by attacking the blood vessels that allow tumors to grow. Using
      metronomic doses of a drug called cytoxan can also decrease T regulatory cells, a specific
      type of cell that tumors use to hide from the immune system.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and anti-tumor effect of the tumor cell
      vaccination plus low dose, metronomic chemotherapy in treating patients with
      relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

      Week 36: Immune Evaluation

      Week 52 (One year): RCR, Long Term Follow Up

      Years 2 through 15: RCR, Long Term Follow Up

      Chemotherapy: Oral cytoxan will be given daily (50 mg/m2/day prior to the first vaccine and
      25 mg/m2 for subsequent doses). It will start 72 hours prior to the first vaccination and
      will be held on the day of vaccine administration and then held for an additional 96 hours
      prior to restarting.

      Immunotherapy: 1 x 10^7 cells/m2 each of unmodified SKNLP, with gene-modified SJNB-JF-IL2
      and SJNB-JF-LTN neuroblastoma cell lines will be given as a subcutaneous injection over 1
      minute.  These vaccine injections will be given on day 0 of week 0 and then on day 0 (+72
      hours) of weeks 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 16 and 20.

      Hydrocortisone 2 mg/kg (max dose of 200 mg) IV, diphenhydramine 1 mg/kg IV (max dose of 50
      mg), and epinephrine 0.01 mL/kg (of 1:1,000 solution, max dose of 0.5 mL) subcutaneously
      will be available at the bedside prior to each vaccine administration.

      Due to the unknown effects of metronomic chemotherapy and allogeneic tumor cell vaccination
      on a fetus, all females of child bearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy
      test prior to the 1st and 5th immunization.

      Dose Modifications:

      Cytoxan- Hematologic Toxicity Dose Modification: Patients who have grade 4 neutropenia or a
      platelet count &lt; 20,000 will have cytoxan dose withheld. CBC should be obtained 2 x each
      week during this time. If toxicity resolves (i.e. ANC &gt; 750, Platelet count &gt; 50,000) within
      14 days, cytoxan can be restarted with a 25% dose reduction. This dose reduction should be
      continued for additional courses. If the toxicity does not resolve within 14 days, the
      patient should come off study.

      If the same toxicity occurs, patients will have their dose of cytoxan reduced by another 25%
      (total of 50% from starting dose). If an additional dose reduction is required, the patient
      must come off study at that time.

      Cytoxan should be held during all episodes of fever. If a patient is admitted to the
      hospital secondary to fever and neutropenia, upon count recovery the dose of cytoxan should
      be reduced by 50%. If counts are at baseline by the time of the next scheduled vaccine
      administration, the investigator may choose to increase the dose back to 100%.

      Dose reductions should be discussed with the Principal Investigator.

      Vaccine- Dose Modification for Allergic Reactions Patients who experience grade 3 or 4
      allergic reaction to vaccine administration will be removed from the protocol

      Patients will be evaluated and blood counts obtained prior to every cycle of oral metronomic
      chemotherapy and vaccine administration. Patients will also be evaluated at week 24, 36, 52,
      and annually for the next 15 years. Evaluations not associated with vaccine administration
      may be accomplished by contact with a primary care taker and/or contact by the research
      coordinator. Additional visits will be obtained as clinically indicated.
