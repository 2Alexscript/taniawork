      In the study the investigators will use busulfan and cyclophosphamide (BuCy) backbone with
      the addition of fludarabine as the preparative Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) regimen. As an
      attempt to improve engraftment rate and reduce infections the investigators are going to
      incorporate fludarabine in the conditioning regimen. The use of a BuCy backbone has been
      widely used and comparable to total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide (Cy/TBI) regimen.

      Encouraging data on adding fludarabine to the SCT regimen have been reported. A
      fludarabine-based, conditioning regimen, with adequate immunosuppressive activity could
      conceivably allow engraftment of stem cells from alternative donors in hematologic
      malignancies patients with acceptable engraftment rates and low transplant-related
      mortality. Regimen-related toxicity is believed to be a major contributing factor to GVHD.
      Therefore this approach may also lead to reduced GVHD, as some investigators have suggested.

      In our study as an attempt to decrease the rate of viral infection and reactivation, the
      investigators will avoid ATG (Thymoglobulin) / Campath (anti-CD52) and instead administer
      Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF).  The addition of fludarabine should compensate any increase
      risk of graft failure with the removal of the ATG/Campath. The investigators anticipate that
      the removal of ATG/Campath will facilitate immune reconstitution more efficiently after
      receiving a UCBT.

      The following will be given as the conditioning regimen for the transplant:

      BUSULFAN: Busulfan (intravenous BUSULFEX) dosing will be as follows: patients &lt;12 kg: 1.1
      mg/kg/dose IV every 6 hours for 16 doses total; patients &gt;12 kg: 0.8 mg/kg/dose IV every 6
      hours for 16 doses. Administration and pharmacokinetic monitoring will be performed as per
      standard practice. Anticonvulsants will be given in accordance with standard Blood and
      Marrow Transplant Program recommendations.

      CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE: Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/dose) will be given IV on day -5, - 4, -3, and
      -2 over 2 hours. The total dose to be given over 4 days is 200 mg/kg. Mesna will be given in
      accordance with standard Blood and Marrow Transplant.

      FLUDARABINE:  Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 will be given I.V. daily over 1 hour for 3 days.
      Preparation, administration and monitoring will be according to standard practice procedure.

      POST TRANSPLANT IMMUNOSUPPRESSION:

        -  CSA will begin on day -3. For children &lt;40 kg, the initial dose will be 2.5 mg/kg IV
           over 2 hours every 12 hours. Dose adjustments will be made to maintain levels above
           200ng/ml.  Levels will be done on day 0 and then as clinical indicated.  CSA will be
           tapered per institutional SOP.  Once the patient can tolerate oral medications and has
           a normal gastrointestinal transit time, CSA will be converted to an oral form.

        -  MMF will begin on day 0 at a dose of 15 mg/Kg IV or orally tid and will be discontinued
           on day +45 unless GVHD is present.

      CNS disease: Patients with CNS relapse or primary CNS disease that is symptomatic or
      associated to radiological changes will receive additional irradiation to the craniospinal
      axis.

      SUPPORTIVE CARE:

        -  Supportive care will be provided as per standard practice of the Blood and Marrow Stem
           Cell Transplant program at the Texas Children's Hospital, including all prophylactic
           and therapeutic clinical care issues. These practices may be modified if necessary for
           any individual patient in order to provide optimum care for that particular patient.

        -  IVIG: Intravenous immunoglobulin (500mg/kg per dose) will be given monthly until
           discontinuation of GVHD therapy and documentation of antibody production.

        -  CB-CTLs: Patients enrolled in this protocol may also be eligible for infusion of
           CB-derived multivirus-specific CTL to provide virus-specific immune reconstitution and
           treatment of viral infections after CBT.

             chemotherapy.  This includes patients who have relapsed after standard chemotherapy
             treatments and patients in first remission with unfavorable prognostics features.

          -  Related or Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Unit with 0-1 antigen mismatch at HLA-A and
             B (at low resolution) and DRB1 (at high resolution) with a total nucleated cell dose
