    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, is to determine the differences of clinical outcomes between
      hypoxic pre-treatment group and control group in bone marrow stem cell transplantation
      (BM-SCT) to treat acute myocardial infarction (AMI); and to evaluate the safety of both
      treatments. Heart failure patients underwent PCI treatment after AMI and with informed
      consent, are randomized allocation into hypoxic pre-treated BM-SCT group, normoxic
      pre-treated BM-SCT group, and control group. Cell resuspension is intracoronary injected
      into patients receiving coronary angiography, IL-6, CRP, TNF and BNP are detected;
      echocardiography, cardiac MRI and ECT are analyzed to evaluate heart function and alive
      myocardial cells. Holter's ECG monitor is employed to observe arrhythmia and embolism. We
      hypothesize that, by receiving hypoxic pre-treated BM-SCT, impaired heart function will be
      reversed in heart failure patients.
