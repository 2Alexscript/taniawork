    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Observational Study is long term follow-up of the Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus -1 (HIV-1) infected patients who have received a gene therapy product (anti-HIV-1
      Ribozyme [OZ1]) as part of an earlier phase 2 trial. Patients are seen twice yearly until 5
      years from initial infusion of study drug has elapsed and then yearly for the rest of their
      lives.  The study will monitor for and record any ill effects from the gene therapy product
      to provide long term safety information.

    <textblock>
      During an earlier phase 2 base trial (study # NCT00074997), HIV-1 infected patients received
      a gene therapy product (anti-HIV-1 Ribozyme [OZ1]).  Gene therapy is an investigational
      treatment where genes are inserted into an individual's cells and tissues to treat a
      disease.   The gene therapy OZ1 is thought to have anti-HIV-1 actions.  This is an
      Observational Study to provide long term follow-up of those HIV-1 infected patients who
      received the gene therapy product (anti-HIV-1 Ribozyme [OZ1]) as part of the earlier study.
      Patients are seen twice yearly until 5 years from initial infusion of study drug has elapsed
      and then yearly for the rest of their lives.  The study will monitor for and record any ill
      effects from the gene therapy product to provide long term safety information. Observational
      study - no investigational drug administered.
