      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and overall survival at 100 days, 1
      year, and 3 years after umbilical cord blood transplant (UCBT) in pediatric patients with
      lymphoid hematological malignancies.

      In this study the investigators will use total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide (TBICy)
      backbone with the addition of fludarabine as the preparative stem cell transplant (SCT)
      regimen. The use of total body irradiation and cyclophosphamide (Cy/TBI) as conditioning for
      SCT has been widely used and is the current standard of care for children with acute
      lymphoid leukemias. As an attempt to improve engraftment rate and reduce infections the
      investigators are going to incorporate fludarabine in the conditioning regimen. In the
      study, as an attempt to decrease the rate of viral infection and reactivation, the
      investigators will remove ATG (Thymoglobulin) of the conditioning regimen and substitute it
      with fludarabine.  The addition of fludarabine should compensate any increase risk of graft
      failure with the removal of the ATG. The investigators anticipate that the removal of ATG
      will facilitate immune reconstitution more efficiently after receiving a UCBT.

      The following will be given as the preparative/immunosuppressive therapy.

      Cyclophosphamide (50 mg/kg/dose) will be given IV on day -5,-4, -3, and -2 over 2 hours. The
      total dose to be given over 4 days is 200 mg/kg. Mesna will be given in accordance with
      standard Blood and Marrow Transplant.

      Fludarabine 40 mg/m2 will be given i.v. daily over 1 hour for 3 days (-4, -3, -2).
      Preparation, administration and monitoring will be according to standard practice procedure.

      Post transplant Immunosuppression:

        -  CSA will begin on day -3. For children &lt;40 kg, the initial dose will be 2.5 mg/kg IV
           over 2 hours every 12 hours. Dose adjustments will be made to maintain levels above
           200ng/ml.  Levels will be done on day 0 and then as clinically indicated.  CSA will be
           tapered per institutional SOP.  Once the patient can tolerate oral medications and has
           a normal gastrointestinal transit time, CSA will be converted to an oral form.

        -  MMF will begin on day 0 at a dose of 15 mg/Kg IV or orally tid and will be discontinued
           on day +45 unless GVHD is present.

      EVALUATIONS DURING THE STUDY:

             mismatched / related or unrelated) with a lymphoid hematologic malignancy (acute
             lymphoblastic leukemia, hodgkin/non-hodgkin lymphoma) unlikely to be cure by standard
             chemotherapy.  This includes patients who have relapsed after standard chemotherapy
             treatments and patients in first remission with unfavorable prognostics features.

          -  Related or Unrelated Umbilical Cord Blood Unit with 0-1 antigen mismatch, Total
             Nucleated cell dose of ≥4x10^7/kg.

          -  Lansky/Karnofsky scores &gt;60

          -  Written informed consent and/or signed assent line from patient, parent or guardian.

          -  Female patient had a negative pregnancy test

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with uncontrolled infections.  For bacterial infections, patients must be
             receiving definitive therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 72 hours
             prior to enrollment.  For fungal infections patients must be receiving definitive
             systemic antifungal therapy and have no signs of progressing infection for 1 week
             prior to enrollment.  Progressing infection is defined as hemodynamic instability
             attributable to sepsis or new symptoms, worsening physical signs or radiographic
             findings attributable to infection.  Persisting fever without other signs or symptoms
             will not be interpreted as progressing infection.

          -  Severe renal disease (Creatinine &gt; x 3 normal for age)

          -  Severe hepatic disease (direct bilirubin &gt; 3 mg/dl or SGOT &gt; 500)

          -  Patient has DLCO &lt; 50% predicted or FEV1 &lt; 50% of predicted, if applicable

          -  Patients with symptomatic cardiac failure unrelieved by medical therapy or evidence
