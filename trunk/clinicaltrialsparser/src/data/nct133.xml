  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Imatinib (IM) is first-line treatment for patients with newly diagnosed CML in chronic
      phase. The drug is associated with high rates of cytogenetic responses with minimal toxicity
      in approximately 80% of patients. In 20% of patients however, the disease is either
      initially unresponsive to IM (Imatinib), resistance develops within a few months, or blast
      crisis occurs early and unexpectedly following an initial response. An increasing body of
      clinical evidence indicates that single agent molecularly targeted therapy (as in
      Gleevec/Imatinib) will not cure most patients with CML, as molecular remissions are rare.
      There is currently no clinically useful predictive tests to identify AT DIAGNOSIS those
      patients who are destined to be IM failures. The authors of this study have recently
      demonstrated that CML stem/progenitor cells are biologically insensitive to IM and are also
      genetically unstable and rapidly generate IM-resistant mutants in vitro and in vivo. The
      team recently discovered that the CD34 stem/progenitor cells of newly diagnosed CML patients
      who subsequently fail to respond to IM treatment show a reduced response to IM and a higher
      frequency of BCR-ABL mutations by comparison of 14 IM non-responders with 11 IM-responders.
      If this finding can be validated in a larger prospective cohort of patients, this predictive
      test could be used to more rationally design treatment plans with early addition of
      alternative therapies ie: Dasatinib or combination therapies for patients according to their
      individual risk profiles.

      Hypothesis:

      The clinical response of newly diagnosed chronic phase CML patients to IM can be predicted
      by certain biological properties of their CD34 stem/progenitor cells which are variable
      among patients.

      Specimens of whole blood will be collected, and used for measurement of sensitivity of the
      patient's individual pretreatment colony-forming cells (CFCs) to IM exposure in vitro, the
      level of expression of BCR-ABL, OCT1, ABCB1/MDR and ABCG2 transcripts in their CD34+ cells
      and the frequency of mutant BCR-ABL transcripts in the same cells.  The cells are cultured
