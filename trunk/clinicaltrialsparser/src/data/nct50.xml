      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of busulfan, etoposide,
      cytarabine and melphalan (BuEAM) as a conditioning for autologous stem cell transplantation
      in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

    <textblock>
      High-dose conditioning regimens commonly used in patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma are BEAM
      (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and melphalan), BEAC (BCNU, etoposide, cytarabine, and
      cyclophosphamide), CBV (cyclophosphamide, carmustine, and etoposide), and combination
      regimen with total body irradiation. Three-year progression free survival of patients with
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma received above high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell
      rescue was reported as 40-50%, which is still unsatisfactory.

      Busulfan (Bu)-based preparative regimens, which are commonly used with allogeneic stem cell
      transplantation have also been studied with autologous stem cell transplantation for
      lymphomas.

      The development of intravenous busulfan achieved 100% bioavailability bypassing the oral
      route and increased safety and reliability of generating therapeutic busulfan levels,
      maximizing efficacy.

      Recently, one prospective study showed that a combination conditioning regimen of
      intravenous busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide was found to be well tolerated and
      seemed to be effective in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Another prospective
      study for patients with multiple myeloma showed that intravenous busulfan plus melphalan
      conditioning regimen made no grade 3-4 non-hematologic complication.
