    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, assessing the feasibility, safety and toxicity of an mTOR (mammalian
      target of Rapamycin) inhibitor (MTI), rapamycin, when administered with HyperCVAD
      (Hyperfractionated Cyclophosphamide, Vincristine, Doxorubicine and Dexamethasone), with an
      ultimate goal to perform a phase II study to evaluate response rates and survival in adults
      with Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) and aggressive lymphoid malignancies.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to characterize the feasibility, safety and
      tolerability of therapy with Hyper-CVAD and Rapamycin in adults with ALL and other
      aggressive lymphoid malignancies.

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of Rapamycin given in combination with Hyper-CVAD
      during A treatment cycles, and Methotrexate and Cytarabine in B treatment cycles. Both
      cycles will also contain the drug Rituximab if the patient has a B cell type of leukemia or
      lymphoma.

      This combination of drugs are being studied to determine whether or not these drugs will
      have an effect in treating this disease.

      Current therapeutic regimens for induction of remission in ALL are broadly similar. There is
      no single best regimen for induction therapy. The hyper-CVAD regimen is of particular
      interest because it does not include asparaginase as part of the therapeutic regimen and the
      results of induction are similar to other published regimens.

      The HyperCVAD regimen with or without rituximab is also an accepted induction regimen for
      lymphoblastic lymphoma, Burkitt and Burkitt like lymphoma, Mantle Cell Lymphoma, and ALL in
      the elderly.  The regimen has also been used as a salvage regimen in patients with the above
      diagnoses who have relapsed after another induction regimen.

      This trial will add a novel agent, an mTOR inhibitor (MTI), rapamycin, to act
      synergistically with the HyperCVAD regimen. This is a pilot study, assessing the
      feasibility, safety and toxicity of this regimen, with an ultimate goal to perform a phase
      II study to evaluate response rates and survival.

      This is a pilot study of the Hyper-CVAD regimen with Rapamycin for the treatment of adults
      with acute lymphoblastic leukemia or other aggressive lymphoid malignancies.  The standard
      Hyper-CVAD regimen will be used, with the addition of the investigational agent, Rapamycin.
      Hyper-CVAD alone is one of the current standard induction and salvage regimens used to treat
      ALL and other aggressive lymphoid malignancies.

      Subjects included will have either de novo, relapsed, or refractory ALL or another
      aggressive lymphoid malignancy.

      Chemotherapy will consist of 4 'A' cycles alternating with 4 'B' cycles, every 21 days, or
      as count recovery allows (at least 14 days apart) as follows:  1A; 1B; 2A; 2B, 3A; 3B; 4A;
      4B. This is dependent on white blood cell count recovery.

    <description>This will be assessed by evaluating the tolerability of this regimen compared to historical controls who received Hyper-CVAD or Hyper-CVAD/ Rituximab regimens. The treatment will be designated feasible for an individual subject if in 80% of chemotherapy cycles the subject has count recovery that allows for starting the subsequent cycle by Day 28. Count recovery is defined as ANC of &gt; 0.5 x 109 AND Platelet count &gt; 50 x 109/L.
Hyper-CVAD/Rapamycin will be deemed acceptable if it is feasible to administer in 80% or more of subjects.</description>
