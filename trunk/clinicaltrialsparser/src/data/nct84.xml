      This randomized control study is aimed to determine efficacy of umbilical cord blood and
      erythropoietin combination therapy for children with cerebral palsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy is a disorder of movement and posture that result from a nonprogressive
      lesion or injury of the immature brain. It is a leading cause of childhood onset disability
      through one's life. Umbilical cord blood(UCB) is suggested as therapeutic method for
      cerebral palsy which resulted from animal studies. Stem cells included in UCB is expected to
      exert therapeutic efficacy for functional recovery.

      It is also suggested that erythropoietin is useful to repair neurological injury in brain.
      The main mechanism of erythropoietin is supposed to be neuroprotection and neurogenesis
      which would reinforce the effect of stem cell as well.

      Although autologous umbilical cord would be safe, the children who have problems at birth
      seldom have autologous stem cell. Allogenic umbilical cord blood might be useful for these
      children if its effect is approved.
