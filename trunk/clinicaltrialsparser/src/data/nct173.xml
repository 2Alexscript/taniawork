    <textblock>
      The investigators want to know the role of Peripheral hematopoietic stem cell infusion in
      avoiding  Drug Induced Liver Injury,and also try to research SNPs genotyping associated with
      Drug Induced Liver Injury.

      1. The researcher investigate the incidence and the cause of Drug Induced Liver Injury in
           MBC.

        2. Patients having a complete clinical history and physical examination, receive routine
           chemotherapy.

        3. Venous blood Sample(4 ml)is collected before and after each cycle according to the
           planning time.

        4. Genomic DNA,RNA and upper serum is isolated. ELISA、rt-PCR or PCR-direct sequencing is
           used to detect the protein or gene expression associated with liver function.
