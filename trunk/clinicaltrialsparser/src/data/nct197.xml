      Stem cell theray in old stroke patients is a study to treat stroke patients approved before
      in our hospital. We recruit these patients who received stem cell therapy and completed the
      study. We adopted movement-related cortical potential,and cortico-cortical inhibition to
      assess the stroke patients with or without stem cell therapy. Further analyzing the
      correlation of the motor related cortical potential and cortico-cortical inhibition among
      them. We wanted to find out if there are changes in cortical excitability in subjects with
      chronic stroke after stem cell therapy.

        36 patients suffered from old cerebral infarction (middle cerebral artery territory as
        documented on the T2 weight image [T2WI] of MRI) between 6 months and 5 years of onset who
        had initial scores on the National Institute of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) of between 9
