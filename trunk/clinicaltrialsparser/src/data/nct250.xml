      RATIONALE: Bortezomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as rituximab, can block cancer growth in
      different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find
      cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing substances to them. Giving
      bortezomib together with rituximab may kill more cancer cells.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bortezomib and rituximab together
      works in treating patients with mantle cell lymphoma who have previously undergone stem cell
      transplantation

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the two year disease free survival in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) patients
      treated with bortezomib + rituximab after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity profile, safety, overall survival, time to treatment failure,
      remission duration, and biological markers of mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with
      bortezomib + rituximab after autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive bortezomib subcutaneously (SC) over 3-5 seconds and rituximab IV on days 1,
      8,15, and 22. Treatment with bortezomib repeats every 28 days for up to 8 courses and
      treatment with rituximab repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 3 years.
