    <textblock>
      The Stanford Medical Center Program in Multi-Organ Transplantation and the Division of Bone
      marrow Transplantation are enrolling patients into a research study to determine if donor
      stem cells given after a living related one Haplotype match kidney transplantation will
      change the immune system such that immunosuppressive drugs can be completely withdrawn.

      The goal of this study is for the recipients of a living related kidney transplant of one
      HLA haplotype to be withdrawn of immunosuppressive medication and become &quot;tolerant &quot;to their
      kidney graft.  The recipient will receive a conditioning regimen composed of low dose
      radiation to the lymphoid tissue (total lymphoid irradiation, TLI) and anti-thymocyte
      globulin (ATG) at the time of transplant. They will then be infused with purified &quot;stem
      cell&quot; and T-cell from their kidney donors 2 weeks after the transplant to try to achieve
      mixed chimerism of their white blood cells with the donor (the recipient would have a
      mixture some of the with blood cells of the donor and theirs in their blood). The kidney
      donor has to provide peripheral stem cell 6-8 weeks before kidney donation. It is an
      outpatient procedure done using peripheral veins after treatment with G-CSF
      (filgrastim).Immunosuppressive medication will be decreased gradually and possibly stopped
      by the end of the first year after the transplantation if the recipient meets withdrawing
      criteria (persistence of mixed chimerism more than 180 days, no episode of rejection and no
      rejection on surveillance kidney biopsy). Potential candidates need to be approved for
      kidney transplant  and available for close follow-up at Stanford University Medical Center.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. All consenting adult (&gt; 21 years of age) living donor renal transplant recipients at
             Stanford University Medical Center who have a one haplotype match donor.

          2. Patients who agree to participate in the study and sign an Informed Consent.

          3. Patients who have no known contraindication to administration of rabbit ATG or
             radiation.

          4. Males and females of reproductive potential who agree to practice a reliable form of
             contraception for at least 24 months posttransplant.

          5. The donor and the recipient must have an identical blood group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous treatment with rabbit ATG or a known allergy to rabbit proteins.

          2. History of malignancy with the exception of non-melanoma skin malignancies.

          3. Pregnant women or nursing mothers.

          4. Serological evidence of HIV, Hepatitis B or Hepatitis C infection.

          5. Seronegative for CMV, if donor is seropositive.

          6. Leukopenia (with a white blood cell count &lt; 3000/mm3) or thrombocytopenia (with a
             platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3).

          7. PRA greater than 20% or demonstration of donor specific antibody (DSA)

          8. Prior organ transplantation

          9. High risk of primary kidney disease recurrence (i.e.FSGS)
