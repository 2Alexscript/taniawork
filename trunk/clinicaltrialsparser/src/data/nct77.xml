      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new
      experimental drug, OMP21M18, when given in combination with gemcitabine, a drug that is a
      standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer that has not been treated previously with
      chemotherapy. OMP 21M18 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a protein made in the
      laboratory) and was developed to target cancer stem cells. The way the body handles OMP21M18
      will also be investigated. Up to 32 participants, 21 years or older, will be enrolled at up
      to 6 centres in Australia and New Zealand. Following informed consent and screening,
      participants will receive intravenous infusions of OMP21M18 every other week and Gemcitabine
      administered weekly for the first 7 weeks. After 9 weeks, participants will undergo
      assessments to determine their disease status. Participants will continue to receive
      infusions of OMP21M18 every other week and gemcitabine once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks
      out of every 4 weeks until disease progression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Current cancer therapies often produce an initial reduction in tumour size but may not have
      longterm benefits. One possible explanation for this is the presence cancer cell known as a
      cancer stem cells. Cancer stem cells represent a small part of the tumour but are believed
      to be responsible for much of the growth and spread of the cancer. They may also be more
      resistant to traditional therapy, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy.

      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and determine the optimal dose of a new
      experimental drug, OMP21M18, when given in combination with gemcitabine, a drug that is a
      standard treatment for advanced pancreatic cancer that has not been treated previously with
      chemotherapy. OMP 21M18 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (a protein made in the
      laboratory) and was developed to target cancer stem cells. The way the body handles OMP21M18
      will also be investigated. Up to 32 participants, 21 years or older, will be enrolled at up
      to 6 centres in Australia and New Zealand. Following informed consent and screening,
      participants will receive intravenous infusions of OMP21M18 every other week and Gemcitabine
      administered weekly for the first 7 weeks. After 9 weeks, participants will undergo
      assessments to determine their disease status. Participants will continue to receive
      infusions of OMP21M18 every other week and gemcitabine once weekly for 3 consecutive weeks
      out of every 4 weeks until disease progression.

      The first 6 participants will receive OMP21M18 2.5 mg/kg once every other week, the next 6
      participants will receive 5 mg/kg once every other week, and the final 6 participants will
      receive 10 mg/kg once every other week. A Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review
      the data for the 6 participants at each dose level after the last participant in that group
      has been treated for 56 days and decide whether it is safe to move up to the next highest
      dose level. After confirming the optimum dose, 14 additional participants will be treated at
      the highest dose level that the DSMB considers safe.

      Participants will be assessed for disease status every 8 weeks and for safety at every visit
      and for 30 days after the end of study drug treatment. Safety will be assessed by adverse
      event monitoring, physical examination, vital signs, blood tests, cardiac monitoring, and
      participant interview. Response rates, duration of response, time to progression, and
      survival will be evaluated, requiring CT or MRI scans and CA199 (tumour marker) levels at
      baseline and then every 8 weeks. The development of antibodies to treatment will be assessed
      throughout the study and up to 12 weeks after the end of study drug treatment. Blood samples
      will be taken to assess whether OMP21M18 is producing desired changes to the genes and
      proteins related to the cancer (biomarkers).

      The study includes an optional part which will investigate how variations in people's
      genetic makeup affect their response to medications. This involves the collection of one
      blood sample just before participants receive their first dose of study treatment. DNA will
      be extracted from the blood sample for testing.

    <description>Six subjects will be treated with OMP-21M18 2.5 mg/kg once every 14 days.  If this dose is deemed to have an acceptable safety profile by the DSMB, then 6 additional subjects will be treated with OMP-21M18 5 mg/kg once every 14 days.  If this dose is deemed to have an acceptable safety profile by the DSMB, then 6 additional subjects will be treated with OMP 21M18 10 mg/kg once every 14 days.  No dose escalation or reduction will be allowed within a dose cohort.  An additional 14 subjects will be treated at the highest dose of OMP 21M18 that is deemed to have an acceptable safety profile by the DSMB.</description>
