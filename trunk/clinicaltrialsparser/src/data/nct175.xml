      RATIONALE: Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before a donor peripheral blood
      stem cell transplant (PBSCT) helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells
      from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem
      cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells
      from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving total-body
      irradiation (TBI) together with fludarabine phosphate (FLU), cyclosporine (CSP),
      mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), or sirolimus before transplant may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis
      works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies undergoing unrelated donor
      peripheral blood stem cell transplant

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine which of 3 GVHD prophylaxis regimens results in a reduction of acute grades
      II-IV GVHD to =&lt; 40%.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Non-relapse mortality day 180 to =&lt; 15%. II. Compare survival and progression-free
      survival to that achieved under protocols 1463, 1641, 1668 and 1938.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms.

      All patients receive FLU intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days -4 to -2 followed by 2-3
      Gray TBI on day 0.

      ARM I: Patients receive CSP orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days -3 to 96 with taper to day
      150 and MMF PO three times daily (TID) on days 0-29 and then BID on days 30-150 with taper
      to day 180.

      ARM II: Patients receive CSP PO as in arm I. Patients also receive sirolimus PO once daily
      (QD) on days -3 to 150 with taper to day 180.

      ARM III: Patients receive CSP PO, and sirolimus PO as in arm II. Patients also receive MMF
      PO TID on days 0-29 and then BID on days 30-40, MMF will then be discontinued without taper
      unless GVHD or disease relapse/progression occurs.

      TRANSPLANTATION: Patients receive allogeneic PBSCT on day 0 following the TBI.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ages &gt; 50 years with hematologic malignancies treatable by unrelated hematopoietic
             cell transplant (HCT)

          -  Ages =&lt; 50 years of age with hematologic diseases treatable by allogeneic HCT who
             through pre-existing medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be at high
             risk for regimen related toxicity associated with a high dose transplant (&gt; 40% risk
             of transplant related mortality [TRM]); this criterion can include patients with a
             HCT-comorbidity index (CI) score of &gt;= 1; transplants should be approved for these
             inclusion criteria by both the participating institutions' patient review committees
             such as the Patient Care Conference (PCC) at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research
             Center (FHCRC) and by the principal investigators at the collaborating centers;
             patients =&lt; 50 years of age who have received previous high-dose transplantation do
             not require patient review committee approvals; all children &lt; 12 years must be
             discussed with the FHCRC PI (Brenda Sandmaier, MD 206 667 4961) prior to registration

          -  Ages =&lt; 50 years of age with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) (these patients do
             not require patient review committee approvals)

          -  Ages =&lt; 50 years of age with hematologic diseases treatable by allogeneic HCT who
             refuse a high-dose HCT; transplants must be approved for these inclusion criteria by
             both the participating institutions' patient review committee such as PCC at the
             FHCRC and by the principal investigators at the collaborating centers

        The following diseases will be permitted although other diagnoses can be considered if
        approved by PCC or the participating institutions' patient review committees and the
        principal investigators.

          -  Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL) and other histologies such as Diffuse large B
             cell NHL: not eligible for autologous HCT, not eligible for high-dose allogeneic HCT,
             or after failed autologous HCT

          -  Mantle Cell NHL: may be treated in first complete remission (CR) (Diagnostic lumbar
             puncture [LP] required pre-transplant)

          -  Low grade NHL: with &lt; 6 month duration of CR between courses of conventional therapy

          -  CLL: must have either

          -  1) failed to meet National Cancer Institute (NCI) Working Group criteria for complete
             or partial response after therapy with a regimen containing FLU (or another
             nucleoside analog, e.g. 2-Chlorodeoxyadenosine [2-CDA], pentostatin) or experience
             disease relapse within 12 months after completing therapy with a regimen containing
             FLU (or another nucleoside analog)

          -  2) failed FLU-cyclophosphamide (CY)-Rituximab (FCR) combination chemotherapy at any
             time point; or

          -  3) have &quot;17p deletion&quot; cytogenetic abnormality; patients should have received
             induction chemotherapy but could be transplanted in 1st CR; or

          -  4) patients with a diagnosis of CLL (or small lymphocytic lymphoma) or diagnosis of
             CLL that progresses to prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), or T-cell CLL or PLL

          -  Hodgkin Lymphoma: must have received and failed frontline therapy

          -  Multiple Myeloma: must have received prior chemotherapy; consolidation of
             chemotherapy by autografting prior to nonmyeloablative HCT is permitted

          -  Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML): must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of transplant

          -  Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL): must have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at the time of
             transplant

          -  Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML): Patients will be accepted if they are beyond first
             chronic phase (CP1) and if they have received previous myelosuppressive chemotherapy
             or HCT, and have &lt; 5% marrow blasts at time of transplant

          -  Myelodysplasia (MDS)/Myeloproliferative Syndrome (MPS): Patients must have &lt; 5%
             marrow blasts at time of transplant

          -  Waldenstrom's Macroglobulinemia: must have failed 2 courses of therapy

          -  DONOR: Matched for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, B, C, DRB1 and DQB1 by high
             resolution typing

          -  DONOR: Only a single allele disparity will be allowed for HLA-A, B, or C as defined
             by high resolution typing

          -  DONOR: Donors are excluded when preexisting immunoreactivity is identified that would
             jeopardize donor hematopoietic cell engraftment; this determination is based on the
             standard practice of the individual institution; the recommended procedure for
             patients with 10 of 10 HLA allele level (phenotypic) match is to obtain a panel
             reactive antibody (PRA) screens to class I and class II antigens for all patients
             before HCT; if the PRA shows &gt; 10% activity, then flow cytometric or B and T cell
             cytotoxic cross matches should be obtained; the donor should be excluded if any of
             the cytotoxic cross match assays are positive; for those patients with an HLA Class I
             allele mismatch, flow cytometric or B and T cell cytotoxic cross matches should be
             obtained regardless of the PRA results; a positive anti-donor cytotoxic crossmatch is
             an absolute donor exclusion

          -  DONOR: Patient and donor pairs homozygous at a mismatched allele in the graft
             rejection vector are considered a two-allele mismatch, i.e., the patient is A*0101
             and the donor is A*0102, and this type of mismatch is not allowed

          -  DONOR: Only filgrastim (G-CSF) mobilized PBSC only will be permitted as a
             hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) source on this protocol

        Exclusion Criteria:

             cancers) who have been rendered with no evidence of disease, but have a greater than
             20% chance of having disease recurrence within 5 years; this exclusion does not apply
             to patients with non-hematologic malignancies that do not require therapy

          -  Fungal infections with radiological progression after receipt of amphotericin B or
             active triazole for greater than 1 month

        Organ dysfunction:

             to the Standard Practice Antifungal Therapy Guidelines

          -  The addition of cytotoxic agents for &quot;cytoreduction&quot; with the exception of tyrosine
             kinase inhibitors (such as imatinib), cytokine therapy, hydroxyurea, low dose
             cytarabine, chlorambucil, or rituxan will not be allowed within three weeks of the
             initiation of conditioning

          -  DONOR: Donor (or centers) who will exclusively donate marrow

          -  DONOR: Donors who are HIV-positive and/or, medical conditions that would result in
