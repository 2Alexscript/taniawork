  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Allogeneic blood stem cell transplant remains the only potential curative treatment for
      myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) to date. Pre-transplant induction chemotherapy with
      leukemia-type regimens is associated with significant toxicity and even death. The
      hypomethylating agents decitabine and 5-azacytidine have been shown in studies to cause
      improved hematologic parameters and partial or complete responses in patients with high risk
      MDS compared to standard therapy. In contrast to leukemia-type chemotherapy, decitabine is
      associated with a relatively low risk of toxicity.  We therefore propose to treat
      transplant-eligible MDS patients with Decitabine as induction therapy and a bridge to
      transplant.

      Hypothesis:

        1. Decitabine is able to reduce disease burden as measured by blood and marrow blast
           counts prior to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant to below 5%.

        2. Decitabine is well-tolerated by patients with high-risk MDS and will be a safe
           induction agent and bridge prior to allogeneic transplant in transplant-eligible
           patients.

      Primary endpoint:

        1. safety and tolerability of Decitabine prior to transplant (assessed by occurence of
           non-hematologic toxicities of grade 3 or more as defined by CTC grading)

        2. reduction in pre-transplant disease burden ability to achieve blast &lt;5% in the bone
           marrow and peripheral blood

      Secondary endpoints:

        1. Proportion of patients with suitable donor able to proceed to an allogeneic
           hematopoietic cell transplant.

        2. Non-relapse mortality

        3. time to neutrophil engraftment

        4. Overall survival and disease-free survival.

      Patients will receive Decitabine until blast &lt;5% is achieved, suitable HLA-matched donor or
      umbilical cord blood is available up to a maximum of 6 cycles.  Patient who progress on
      therapy or are unable to find a donor by 6 cycles will be removed from protocol.  The
      method, conditioning regimen and choice of donor will be determined based on patient's age
      and functional status, and transplant physician's discretion. The available regimens are
      standardized within the center
