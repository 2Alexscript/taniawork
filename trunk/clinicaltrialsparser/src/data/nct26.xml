      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as busulfan and fludarabine phosphate,
      before a donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-vs-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an
      immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte globulin before
      transplant and giving azacitidine, tacrolimus, and methotrexate after the transplant may
      stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This phase II clinical trial is studying how well giving busulfan, fludarabine
      phosphate, and antithymocyte globulin followed by donor stem cell transplant and azacitidine
      works in treating patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndrome and older patients with
      acute myeloid leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To determine if reduced-intensity conditioning, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell
           transplantation, and azacitidine consolidation can improve 2-year progression-free
           survival of patients with high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes and of older patients
           with acute myeloid leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To determine the safety and feasibility of using post-transplantation azacitidine.

        -  To determine the ability to use pharmacokinetic-directed busulfan to achieve area under
           the curve (AUC) within 20% of target AUC in &gt; 80% of patients.

        -  To determine the rate of grade II-IV and III-IV acute graft-vs-host disease (GVHD).

        -  To determine the incidence of extensive chronic GVHD.

        -  To determine treatment-related mortality at 100 days and at 1 year.

        -  To determine 5-year overall survival.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

        -  Reduced-intensity conditioning: Patients receive fludarabine phosphate IV over 30
           minutes on days -7 to -3, busulfan IV over 3 hours on days -6 to -3, and anti-thymocyte
           globulin IV over 4-10 hours on days -6 to -5 (matched sibling donor [MSD]) or -6 to -4
           (matched unrelated donor [MUD]).

        -  Transplantation: Patients undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation on
           day 0 or on days 0-1.

        -  Graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis: Patients receive oral or IV tacrolimus on days -2 to
           90 with taper on days 150-180. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6
           (MSD), and 11 (MUD).

        -  Consolidation: Beginning on day 42, patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously or IV
           on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses.

      Blood and bone marrow samples may be collected periodically for correlative and
      pharmacokinetic studies.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 5 years.
