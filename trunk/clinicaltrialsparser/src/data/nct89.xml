  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer remains a highly lethal disease with little clinically meaningful benefit
      from current standard chemotherapy. Novel approaches are urgently needed to address inherent
      resistance to our current therapies. A primary reason for ultimate resistance to therapy is
      due to existence of cancer stem cells in a pancreatic cancer which are resistant to
      chemotherapy leading to treatment failure and death. Treatment with GDC-0449 to target the
      stem cell compartment will be combined with gemcitabine to target the remaining tumor cell
      compartment. This two-pronged approach reflects the recognition that tumors are composed of
      heterogeneous cells and a meaningful improvement in outcome in pancreatic cancer hinges on
      effectively targeting all tumor cells. Treatment with GDC-0449 will inhibit the sonic
      hedgehog pathway signaling in cancer stem cells and the downstream effects in the tumor
      microenvironment will enhance efficacy of treatment with gemcitabine and improve progression
      free survival and overall survival in pancreatic cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreas cancer.

          -  Patients must have metastatic disease or recurrent disease following surgical therapy

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) &gt;20
             mm with conventional techniques or as &gt;10 mm with spiral CT scan.

          -  Patients must have disease accessible for core needle biopsy both prior to initiation
             of therapy and on Day 21 (+ or - 1 day) of GDC-0449 treatment.

          -  No previous therapy for advanced pancreas cancer is permitted. Prior adjuvant therapy
             is allowed provided that the last day of therapy was at least 6 months prior to
             registration.

          -  Age &gt;18 years.

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks

          -  ECOG performance status &lt;1(Karnofsky &gt;70%

          -  Patients must have adequate organ and bone marrow function as defined below:

          -  leukocytes      &gt;3,000/mcL

          -  absolute neutrophil count  &gt;1,500/mcL

          -  platelets      &gt;100,000/mcL

          -  total bilirubin     &lt; 2.0 mg/dl

          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT)  &lt;2.5x institutional upper limit of normal &lt;5x if liver involved
             in tumor

          -  creatinine      &lt;2.0 mg/dl

          -  women of child-bearing potential and men must use two forms of contraception (i.e.,
             barrier contraception and one other method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior
             to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 12 months
             post-treatment. Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum
             pregnancy test.

          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450) may be enrolled with caution. Caution should be exercised
             when dosing GDC-0449 concurrently with medications that are substrates of CYP2C8,
             CYP2C9, and CYP2C19 and have narrow therapeutic windows.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 6 months prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 6 months earlier.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to GDC-0449 or other agents used in the study.

          -  Patients on anticoagulation with coumadin are ineligible; however anticoagulation
             with enoxaparin is acceptable for study entry.

          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with
             intestinal absorption.  Patients must be able to swallow capsules.

          -  Patients with clinically active liver disease, including active viral or other
             hepatitis or cirrhosis, are ineligible.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia or hypokalemia
             defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the institution, despite adequate
             electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because GDC-0449 is a Hh pathway
             inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants
             secondary to treatment of the mother with GDC-0449, breastfeeding should be
             discontinued if the mother is treated with GDC-0449.  These potential risks may also
             apply to other agents used in this study.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with GDC-0449.  In addition, these
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with
             marrow-suppressive therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients
             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
