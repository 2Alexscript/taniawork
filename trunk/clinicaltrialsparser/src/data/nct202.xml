      RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine and melphalan, before a
      donor stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It also stops the
      patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may
      replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells
      (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor lymphocyte
      infusion) that have been treated in the laboratory after the transplant may help increase
      this effect. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response
      against the body's normal cells. Giving alemtuzumab before transplant and cyclosporine after
      transplant, may stop this from happening.

      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying donor lymphocyte infusion after stem
      cell transplant in preventing cancer relapse or cancer progression in patients with
      Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, follicular lymphoma, small lymphocytic non-Hodgkin lymphoma,
      or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate the effect of prophylactic transfer of donor CD4 cells after T-cell
           depleted reduced-intensity HLA-identical sibling transplantation upon the risk of
           relapse or progression in patients with follicular or small lymphocytic non-Hodgkin
           lymphoma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

      Secondary

        -  To evaluate the effect of prophylactic transfer of donor CD4 cells upon the risk of
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the effect of prophylactic transfer of donor CD4 cells upon the rates of
           conversion to full donor chimerism in peripheral blood in these patients.

        -  To determine the effect of prophylactic transfer of donor CD4 cells upon immune
           reconstitution in these patients.

        -  To determine the feasibility of detecting minimal residual disease in peripheral blood
           in these patients.

        -  To evaluate the impact of prophylactic transfer of donor CD4 cells upon non-relapse
           mortality and overall survival of these patients.

      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.

      Patients receive fludarabine IV, melphalan IV, and alemtuzumab IV as reduced intensity
      conditioning for T-cell depletion followed by a reduced-intensity HLA-identical sibling stem
      cell transplantation on day 0. Withdrawal of cyclosporine immunosuppression therapy commence
      at day 50 with tapering over a period of 3-4 weeks, according to the discretion of the PI.
      Patients are reassessed between day 60-75 post-transplantation. Patients with stable
      engraftment, no significant graft-versus-host disease, and no early relapse or progression
      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

        -  Arm I: Patients receive an allogeneic CD4 donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) at a dose of
           1 x10^6 CD4 cells/kg body weight without any other medication once between day 100-120.

        -  Arm II: Patients receive no further treatment. Patients undergo blood sample collection
           and bone marrow biopsy or aspiration periodically for chimerism studies and
           translational research.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years and
      then annually.
