  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, group sequential, randomized, three arm, placebo-controlled, double
      blind, study that will enroll approximately 360 patients at no more than thirty-five  (35)
      international clinical sites.  Additional blinding measures will be taken in the assessment
      of study outcomes. The doses of the test material (ADRCs) for each arm are described in the
      protocol.  The study will include up to three arms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  MI duration of minimum 150 minutes and maximum of 12 hours from onset of symptoms to
             PCI (defined as the first sustained restoration of TIMI III flow) in the culprit
             vessel

          -  Myocardial Infarction Criteria:

          -  Ischemic symptoms AND

          -  Development of pathologic Q waves on the ECG; or

          -  ECG changes indicative of ischemia (ST segment elevation or depression); or

          -  New left bundle branch block: AND

          -  Creatine phosphokinase Isoenzyme (MB Form) &gt; 100 IU/L between admission and
             randomization

          -  Successful revascularization of the culprit lesion in a major epicardial vessel
             within 180 minutes to 12 hours defined as:

          -  TIMI III flow

          -  Area of hypo- or akinesia corresponding to the territory of culprit lesion, as
             determined by left ventriculogram at the time of primary PCI
