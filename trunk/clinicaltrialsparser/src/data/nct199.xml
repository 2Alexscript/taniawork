    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to analyze the safety, pulmonary function, and quality of life
      data of patients with silicosis treated with intrabronchial instillation of bone marrow
      derived mononuclear cells (BMDMC, 2x107) through bronchoscopy.

    <textblock>
      This study will perfume the safety (Phase I) study of 10 patients with silicosis treated
      with intrabronchial instillation of autologous bone marrow derived mononuclear cells (BMDMC,
      2x107) through bronchoscopy. The inclusion criteria is: age between 18-50, chronic and
      accelerated silicosis, characterized with a fibrotic increase in the last two years, FEV1
      &lt;60% and &gt; 40%, FVC &gt; 60% and SaO2 &gt;90%, while the exclusion criteria were: smoking, active
      tuberculosis or other infections, cancer, auto-immune disorders, hematological, hepatic or
      cardiac diseases, and pregnancy. All patients will be subjected to clinical examination,
      answered questionnaires of quality of life  (SGRQ  and  SF36) and dyspnea score  (Borg),
      performed high resolution CT of  thorax, pulmonary function tests with DLCO and 6-minute
      walk test and lung perfusion scintigraphy before and 7, 30, 60, 180 and 360 days after
      treatment.

      For each patient, 2×107 cells will be labeled with 99mTc. Briefly, 500 μl of sterile SnCl2
      solution is added to the cells and the mixture is incubated at room temperature for 10 min.
      Forty-five mCi of 99mTc is then added and incubation continued for another 10 min. After
      centrifugation (500×g for 5 min), the supernatant is removed and the cells are washed in
      saline solution. The pellet was also resuspended in saline solution. Viability of the
      labeled cells was assessed by the trypan blue exclusion test, and was estimated to be
      greater than 93% in all cases. Labeling efficiency (%) was calculated by the activity in the
      pellet divided by the sum of the radioactivity in the pellet plus supernatant and was
      estimated to be greater than 90% in all cases. Whole body and planar scans will be performed
      2 and 24h after instillation. Perfusion scintigraphy will be performed before and 30, 60,
      120 and 180 days after BMDMC therapy. For regional analysis the right and left lungs will be
      divided into three zones: base, midzone, and apex.
