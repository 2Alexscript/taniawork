    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to isolate Umbilical cord Wharton's jelly matrix to be used as
      a scaffold for tissue regenerative applications, including avascular necrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our working hypothesis is that umbilical cord blood Wharton's Jelly matrix has all the
      biochemical and biomechanical characteristics needed in an ideal scaffold for tissue
      engineering. Accordingly, we expect matrix to support the growth and differentiation of
      transplanted mesenchymal stem cells. The first step in this effort is to isolate Wharton's
      Jelly matrix by decellularization. The second step will be to test the ability of this
      matrix to support the growth and differentiation of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells.

    <description>Use the Wharton's Jelly matrix as a scaffold, we should be able to remove the cellular components of Wharton's Jelly. This decellularization process will help decrease antigenicity and accordingly avoid allosensitization. Additionally, the matrix should be able to provide a 3 dimensional (3D) environment needed for biologic and geometric recellularization.</description>

    <description>Use the decellularized matrix for tissue regeneration purposes, it should be able to support recellularization with undifferentiated mesenchymal stem cells and help support their differentiation into different tissues, including bone or cartilage.</description>
