  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the use of extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP)
      with Uvadex is effective in preventing graft versus host disease (GvHD.

    <textblock>
      This study is to test the concept that using ECP treatment prior to and after an allogeneic
      bone marrow transplant (BMT) or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplant will prevent
      the development of GvHD.  This study is not designed to detect a specific treatment effect.
      However, some statements about the outcome of the study are possible.  A sample size of n =
      21 patients could detect a statistically significant difference between the expected rate of
      GvHD in an untreated population, 60%, and our hypothesized rate, 30%, for the
      matched-unrelated recipients.  This calculation is based on a one-sample, two-sided
      chi-square test at the 5% level of significance with 80% power.

      Patients will receive ECP from day -10 and day -8 before transplant and then from day of
      engraftment absolute neutrophil count (ANC&gt;500)until day 90 after transplant. Patients who
      enter the study will receive a BMT or PBSC transplant from a donor who is matched unrelated
      (8/10 to 10/10 match).  Rates of acute GvHD and chronic GvHD that occur in patients are
      50-70% for the matched-unrelated donor transplant.

      The choice of sample size is 21 patients. The analysis will determine if there are favorable
      trends for a treatment effect. Comparison on survival, and rates of acute and chronic GvHD
      will be made with historical controls who have undergone similar myeloablative transplant
      from an unrelated donor.

    <description>Patients will receive 2 ECP treatments on day -10 and day -8 and then for two consecutive days every two weeks starting from post engraftment (ANC &gt; 500)  up to day 90 (total of 10 treatments).  This may be given as an outpatient procedure.
The dose of UVADEX® used to inoculate these cells will be calculated based on the treatment volume collected during the plasma/buffy coat collection process, using the following formula:
Treatment Volume in mL X  0.017 of UVADEX® (20 mcg/ml) required for administration into the recirculation bag = Amount of UVADEX® (in mLs) required for administration into the recirculation bag.
After the cells are inoculated with UVADEX®, the buffy coat/plasma suspension is irradiated with ultraviolet-A light and then re-infused back into the patient.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients are eligible if they have a diagnosis of a hematologic or
             lymphoproliferative malignancy for which a treatment option would be an allogeneic
             BMT or PBSC transplant with a standard myeloablative conditioning +/-ATG with an
             unrelated or related donor.

          -  Patients must have a molecular matched (8/10 or higher) unrelated donor for a BMT OR
             a PBSC transplant.

          -  Patients must be physically and psychologically capable of undergoing a BMT or PBSC
             transplant and the attendant period of strict isolation.

          -  Patients must test negative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Patients must present no evidence of active ongoing infection.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and cardiac function to enable
             the patient to tolerate the extracorporeal volume shifts associated with ECP, as
             determined by the physician's clinical judgment.

          -  Patients greater than or equal to18 years of age.

          -  Patients or their guardians must sign informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have received a prior allogeneic BMT or PBSC transplant

          -  Hypersensitivity or allergy to psoralen (methoxsalen)

          -  Contraindication to radiation, busulphan, cyclophosphamide, cyclosporine CSA), or
             methotrexate (MTX).

          -  Hypersensitivity or allergy to both heparin and citrate products.
