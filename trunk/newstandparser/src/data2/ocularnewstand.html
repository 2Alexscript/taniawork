<p style="margin-top:0px">When Olivia Grech was two, her parents
started to notice that their toddler had trouble seeing in the
dark. By five, Olivia was bumping into things and unable to
manoeuvre in the dark.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;When she was diagnosed with Retinitis
pigmentosa (RP), we were devastated,&quot; said Deborah Grech, who
chairs the Comic Vision Vancouver fundraiser coming to the River
Rock Casino Resort, May 6. &quot;We knew nothing about the disease nor
its implications.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">RP is a hereditary disease that strikes
children and young adults and results in progressive vision loss,
sometimes described as &quot;tunnel vision&quot;, leading to blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Every case is unique, but we were told
that my husband Joseph and I carry the gene,&quot; added Grech.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">When Grech learned of the comedy tour,
Comic Vision, which supports the national Foundation Fighting
Blindness, she came on board immediately.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;As parents, it empowers us to make sure
we stay on top of research and that she has the best doctors
available,&quot; she said. &quot;I&#39;ve been involved for three years now and
the event is so much fun ... you can laugh out loud and support a
great cause.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Every penny raised during the comic fest
goes directly to fund research at universities and hospitals across
the country and closer to home at the University of B.C., said
Amanda Wong, Comic Vision&#39;s event coordinator as well as a family
friend of Grech and Olivia&#39;s part-time babysitter.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Last year, we raised $100,000 here in
B.C. and Canada-wide it was $619,000,&quot; Wong said. &quot;At U.B.C. they
are working on gene therapy project.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Robert Molday, professor, Canada
research chair in vision and macular degeneration and director,
Centre for Macular Research at U.B.C., is heading a research team
to replace the defective gene with a new healthy gene.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;There are promising results coming out
of the success of the gene therapy RPE65, which was a study carried
out and shown to be quite successful in restoring a portion of some
patients&#39; vision,&quot; said Molday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;A single injection has shown
significant recovery in its third year of study.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Molday and his team have been studying
other retinal diseases, which are quite prevalent throughout the
world.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We are using a similar approach as the
RPE65. We are working on Stargardt -- a macular degeneration, which
causes people to experience difficulty in their central vision,&quot;
said Molday, who has been researching eye diseases for more than
three decades. &quot;In the last five years, things are moving faster
and there&#39;s a lot better reading of specific gene mapping.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Meanwhile, Molday said Comic Vision is
vitally important &quot;because they have raised millions to help
researchers pursue some of these experimental treatments to help
find a cure.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">As far as a cure, he is &quot;cautiously
optimistic&quot; and thinks there will be, but it&#39;s a slow process.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We&#39;ve made significant progress in 10
years.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">For Grech, research means a possible
cure or at least a slowing down of her daughter&#39;s disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I am encouraged by the amazing advances
happening right here in B.C. and it gives us hope,&quot; she said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Meanwhile, Comic Vision promises to be a
night of sidesplitting hilarity, said Wong.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The show features headliner and comedian
extraordinaire, Jeff Fink - a host of CBC&#39;s Just for Laughs, All
Access Pass and CityTV&#39;s Your City.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Fink will share the stage with
Torontonian Lawrence Morgenstern, who has written material for the
Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Saturday Night Live and is a
frequent headliner at comedy clubs across North America, as well as
Calgarian Graham Clark, who has performed across Canada in shows
including appearances at Yuk Yuks, CanWest ComedyFest, The Halifax
Comedy Festival and Just for Laughs.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Comic Vision happens Thursday, May 6 at
6:30 p.m. at the River Rock Casino Resort Theatre, 8811 River Rd.
Tickets are $100 and include hors d&#39;ouvres, live and silent auction

<p style="margin-top:0px">This woman knows something about long
roads leading uphill. Cathy Tsilfidis climbed Mount Kilimanjaro
four years ago, a celebration for surviving cancer, which was a
long road of another kind.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The mountain wasn&#39;t what she expected.
&quot;A crazy idea,&quot; she says in retrospect, though with affection. The
top was cold (about minus -5) with so much blowing snow that her
group couldn&#39;t see the magnificent view from the highest point in
Africa.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Back home in Ottawa, Tsilfidis is 10
years into another long journey. She&#39;s a scientist at the Ottawa
Hospital Research Institute, and her team has just secured $1.4
million in funding that will pay for five years of work trying to
prevent blindness from degenerative eye diseases.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The grant comes from the Foundation
Fighting Blindness, a private charity, and the Canadian Institutes
of Health Research.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In terms of curing disease, even a
million and change is a drop in the bucket, paying for one more
step on a journey.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s been almost 10 years now,&quot;
Tsilfidis said this week.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">She joined the University of Ottawa Eye
Institute as a young scientist in 2000. With little previous
experience with eyes. Her former supervisor had been looking for
genes involved with how cells die, and found one. His work began in
muscles, but it also raised the possibility that blocking the
degeneration of muscles might also stop the degeneration of
eyes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The gene is called XIAP, pronounced
Zye-app. In theory scientists can attach this gene to a virus that
carries the gene into cells in the retina.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">There are two tricks here: First, the
XIAP gene has to become active and save the cell&#39;s life. As well,
the surviving cells must also retain their ability to work as a
retina.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But it&#39;s a long slog. Society has this
funny idea that research means a guy in a white coat who stares
through a microscope, decides that vitamin C cures cancer, and goes
on to the next job. Works in the movies; takes longer in real
life.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If the next five years pay off, the team
should have enough evidence to justify applying for more funds to
test the method in humans.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The lab has worked with rats prone to
retinitis pigmentosa, a terrible degenerative disease that begins
with the loss of night vision, then peripheral vision, ending up
with complete blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">So far the gene therapy looks good:
Treating one eye prolongs or even saves the vision of rats that are
going blind, while the untreated eye continues to degenerate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the study to come, there will be six
months of watching the rats. The rodents get a major eye exam every
two weeks to see how the eye cells are reacting to gene
therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">These eye exams required new equipment,
and hundreds of people in Ottawa have had a hand in this without
really realizing it.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If you attended a concert by the Blind
Boys of Alabama in the spring of 2007, you helped raise about
$45,000 to buy a machine that sends signals into the eye of a
living person (or a rat), and tests whether the retina is
functioning.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The machine is made for human patients,
and one obstacle is to adapt it with lenses for animals with much
smaller eyes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Later, it gets trickier. They must
analyse which cells have taken up the XIAP gene.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We can see an area of protection (i.e.
where eye cells didn&#39;t degenerate) but if we can&#39;t prove that our
gene therapy was actually at that site, then we can&#39;t say that the
gene therapy was what caused the protection,&quot; Cathy Tsilfidis
says.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">All this is what society gets for
investing $1.4 million over five years. In fact, that&#39;s just part
of the cost. All the researchers are on staff already, earning
salaries from universities and hospitals. There are two eye
surgeons, an electrophysiologist, a virus expert, a couple of eye
disease researchers. Most are in Ottawa; two are at the
Universities of Michigan and Florida.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Each has a lab with students, post-docs
(recent PhD grads), and technicians.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Patients are already phoning Tsilfidis,
asking for the new treatment. There isn&#39;t one, she must tell them,
and this is hard news for people losing their eyesight.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">She expresses confidence in the theory.
&quot;If I were going blind, I would absolutely have this therapy,&quot; she
says. But there are no guarantees.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">And it does take time -- 10 years to get
this far, five more years beginning now, more years after that for
trials in humans, assuming these are justified.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I know how long it takes to achieve a
goal. It&#39;s not like you do a project and it takes a week. You do a
tiny bit of it and one week later it might give you an idea of what
to do next. It is a long process.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">MONTREAL -- Amanda Basilio wore glasses
at age 2, but her vision continued to decline as Montreal eye
specialists searched for the cause.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Doctors noted the photo cells in the
retina in back of Amanda&#39;s eyes seemed functional. So why couldn&#39;t
the little girl see?</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Now Amanda&#39;s family has new hope for her
restored vision.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">An international team of researchers,
including Robert Koenekoop, director of pediatric ophthalmology at
the MUHC&#39;s Montreal Children&#39;s Hospital, has discovered a crucial
gene involved in such blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Amanda has Leber congenital amaurosis
(LCA). About 200,000 people worldwide suffer from this rare and
currently untreatable condition that causes a very severe form of
childhood blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Koenekoop&#39;s team found SPATA7, the 15th
gene in the illness. A mutation on this gene disrupts protein
transfers within cells, Koenekoop explained.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Published Thursday in the American
Journal of Human Genetics, the work is the collaboration of
Canadian, U.S. and Dutch scientists.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers believe the SPATA7 gene
mutation is a common cause of the eye disease first identified by
Theodore Leber in the 19th century.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Because of its function in protein
transport, the SPATA7 gene also identifies a new pathway, a
cellular mechanism, which opens the door to new treatment
possibilities, Koenekoop said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Efforts are already underway to combat
LCA gene mutations, Koenekoop said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">U.S. and British studies of mutated
RPE65 gene, which is responsible for about 15 per cent of Leber&#39;s
blindness, have restored sight in dogs by injecting adenovirus --
which causes the common cold -- thereby carrying healthy copies of
the gene into the cells of the retina.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Results were &quot;spectacular,&quot; Koenekoop
said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In June, the same group confirmed
similar results in experiments with people.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We are all very excited about the human
trials. . . . Patients reported that they started to see,&quot;
Koenekoop said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Gene therapy for LCA is still a thing of
the future, Koenekoop said. &quot;We&#39;re still looking for 35 per cent of
the genes (in this eye disease).&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The SPATA7 discovery &quot;is exciting news,&quot;
said Jean Bennett, scientist at the F.M. Kirby Centre for Molecular
Ophthalmology at Penn University, who was involved in the landmark
gene study held with blind adults last year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It ratchets the number of genes up to
15, and give us a handle on the way to reverse the blindness in
these individuals,&quot; said Bennett, who did not participate in the
McGill study.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Officials from the Foundation Fighting
Blindness, which supported the study with grant funds, said the
discovery offers LCA patients hope that gene-based therapies will
be developed to restore sight.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">For Amanda, who has coped with very
little vision since birth, nothing will change in the short term,
said her mother, Elizabeth Ramos.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;But now they have a new gene, something
they haven&#39;t seen before. And that means it&#39;s not incurable,&quot; --
not just for Amanda, but for dozens of children like her, Ramos
said.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">An experimental procedure proves
successful after patients with a rare disease see much-improved
vision</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The doctors warned him to go slow after
the surgery, but after 21 years of being legally blind, Dale Turner
wasn&#39;t about to obey.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Just steps out the hospital doors, the
Peterborough, Ont., native tore off his sunglasses and feasted his
eyes on something he&#39;d thought he would never see.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I&#39;d never seen it in all its vibrancy,&quot;
he said of the sunlit Florida sky. &quot;It was a brilliant blue. It was
just an overwhelming moment.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Mr. Turner, 21, recently became the
first Canadian, and one of a handful of patients in the world, to
receive an experimental gene therapy for a rare hereditary eye
disease called Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). There is no
treatment for the disease, which eventually leads to total
blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Mr. Turner took part in an experimental
procedure carried out by researchers at the University of Florida
in Gainesville. Two more teams in the United States and Britain,
each working separately on similar tests, reported their successful
findings earlier this week in the online edition of the New England
Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Within weeks, the patients who took part
in these trials reported varying degrees of vision improvement;
being able to see a mole on a loved one&#39;s face, leaves on a tree, a
few lines on an eye chart, and bright blue skies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If further tests show the treatment
works, experts say the gene therapy - which involves replacing
faulty genes with normal ones - has the potential to reverse
blindness from other kinds of inherited eye diseases.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;There are so many inherited eye
diseases that it makes great sense to start pursuing the others,&quot;
said Barry Byrne, director of the Powell Gene Therapy Center at the
University of Florida, who is leading the trial in which Mr. Turner
received his treatment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Byrne stressed that the current
trial is meant to ensure that the treatment is safe. Further
research will reveal if the therapy could be a potential cure for
those with LCA, a degenerative disease that affects more than 2,000
North Americans.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I want to get the word out to people
who have similar conditions,&quot; Mr. Turner said. &quot;I want to spread
hope so these people have something to look forward to.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">LCA is a group of inherited blinding
diseases that damages light receptors in the retina. It usually
begins stealing light in early childhood and causes total blindness
during a person&#39;s 20s or 30s.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">When Mr. Turner was a baby, his parents
noticed he would respond to their voices, but not their faces.
Growing up, he had tunnel vision and difficulty seeing, especially
at night. Faces were fuzzy, tree tops looked like green lumps and
the sky always looked blue-grey. On a sunny day, it took his eyes
40 minutes to adjust to the dimness after he headed inside.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">When Mr. Turner was 7, his father&#39;s job
took the family to Philadelphia. In an incredible stroke of luck,
they learned that one of the world&#39;s leading LCA researchers, a
University of Pennsylvania researcher named Sam Jacobson, was based
in the city.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Meeting him was just the most
incredible thing,&quot; says Laura Turner, Mr. Turner&#39;s mother. &quot;We
still scratch our heads.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">It was through Dr. Jacobson that Mr.
Turner eventually connected to researchers in Florida, who were
gearing up to begin a clinical trail. Two other teams - one at the
University of Pennsylvania and one in Britain - were doing similar
studies. The treatment had already proven successful in dogs. Now
they wanted to try it in humans. Mr. Turner volunteered along with
eight other patients.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">On Jan. 31, doctors at Shands hospital
at the university inserted a needle into Mr. Turner&#39;s eye,
injecting millions of copies of a working gene, called RPE65, into
the small area between the retina and the back the eye. Patients
who have LCA have a faulty version of the RPE65 gene. Only the
right eye was treated - the worst one - in case anything went
wrong.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Three days later, Mr. Turner caught his
first glimpse of a bright blue sky, and shed tears.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The degree that Dale, in particular,
responded was very rewarding,&quot; Dr. Byrne said. &quot;It really pushes us
toward doing this in a more comprehensive way, toward bigger areas,
or younger patients, or both eyes.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">While the prospect of a cure is
exciting, it can also be scary for people living with limited or no
sight, said Maureen Hartnett of Oakville, Ont., who has a son and
daughter, ages 15 and 18, with LCA. They read in braille, and
daughter Roisin, 18, who studies at Queen&#39;s University in Kingston,
has a guide dog.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;If they said, &#39;there&#39;s a cure, and
you&#39;re going to be able to see,&#39; they wouldn&#39;t just jump out and
say, &#39;Yes!&#39; Because the whole world would change on them,&quot; Ms.
Hartnett said. &quot;They&#39;ve both been able to carry on with their lives
without sight. Then all of a sudden if you could see, it wouldn&#39;t
make any sense. ... They wouldn&#39;t be able to read. All these things
are scary for them.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">About 5 per cent of Mr. Turner&#39;s right
eye was treated and soon doctors will treat the rest, as well as
his left eye.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Now in his fourth year of a business
degree at Trent University, he hopes his postgraduate education
won&#39;t include the seeing aides that help him read his
textbooks.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I feel like a weight has been lifted
off of me,&quot; he said. &quot;The thought of maybe one day down the road
... losing my vision. That&#39;s pretty scary. To know there&#39;s
something preventing that from happening is incredible.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">WASHINGTON -- An experimental gene
therapy has helped restore partial vision to people with congenital
retinal disease, according to breakthrough studies which provide
hope for treating various eye illnesses.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Clinical trials showed success on three
young adults at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia who suffered
from a rare and as yet incurable form of congenital blindness,
according to studies published Sunday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The retinal degenerations include Leber
congenital amaurosis, or LCA, a group of diseases that affect light
receptors in the retina beginning in early childhood and often
causing total blindness in patients in their 20s or 30s.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;This result is important for the entire
field of gene therapy,&quot; study leader Katherine High was quoted as
saying in the New England Journal of Medicine whose website
reported the findings by a collection of international doctors and
scientists.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Gene transfer has been in clinical
trials for over 15 years now, and although it has an excellent
safety record, examples of therapeutic effect are still relatively
few,&quot; High said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The results in this study provide
objective evidence of improvement in the ability to perceive light
and thus lay the groundwork for future studies in this and other
retinal disorders.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Scientists used a genetically engineered
virus as a vector to carry millions of copies of a normal version
of the gene known as RPE65 to the patients&#39; retina via surgical
procedures performed between October 2007 and January 2008.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">A mutation of this gene that normally
makes a protein needed by the retina which senses light and sends
images to the brain, is responsible for a gradual loss of sight
until the patients are blind.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">About two weeks after the surgery all
three patients, age 19, 26 and 26, reported improved vision in the
injected eye and became approximately three times more sensitive to
light than in the other eye, according to study co-author Albert
Auricchio from the Second University of Naples, in Italy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Standard vision tests showed
significantly improved vision in the patients,&quot; Auricchio said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Their vision &quot;improved from detecting
hand movements to reading lines on an eye chart,&quot; said Albert
Maguire, associate professor of opthalmology at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In 2001 Maguire and his wife Jean
Bennett were part of a team which reported successfully using gene
therapy to reverse blindness in dogs affected by the same
congenital blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">A separate clinical trial parallel to
the Philadelphia study was conducted at Britain&#39;s University
College London, also on three young adults, with one 18-year-old
patient showing improved visual function.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers of that study concluded that
there were no major adverse effects of the so-called
Adeno-Associated Virus treatment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Of course, additional studies are
needed in order to assess this approach fully, including the
expansion of the study to include younger children, but these
initial results suggest that AAV-based delivery of genes in the eye
can be accomplished,&quot; said research co-author Barrie Carter,
executive vice-president of Targeted Genetics.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Scientists for the first time have used
gene therapy to dramatically improve sight in people with a rare
form of blindness, a development experts called a major advance for
the experimental technique.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Some vision was restored in four of the
six young people who got the treatment, teams of researchers in the
United States and Britain reported Sunday. Two of the volunteers
who could only see hand motions were able to read a few lines of an
eye chart within weeks.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s a phenomenal breakthrough,&quot; said
Stephen Rose, chief research officer of the Foundation Fighting
Blindness, which helped pay for one study done at Children&#39;s
Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If successful in larger numbers, experts
said, the technique has the potential to reverse blindness from
other kinds of inherited eye diseases.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I think this is incredibly exciting,&quot;
said Dr. Jean Bennett, a professor of ophthalmology at the
University of Pennsylvania and a leader of the Philadelphia study.
&quot;It&#39;s the beginning of a whole new phase of studies.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The research was published online Sunday
by the New England Journal of Medicine in conjunction with
presentations at a medical meeting in Florida.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The two teams of scientists, working
separately, each tested gene replacement therapy in three patients
with a form of a rare hereditary eye disease called Leber&#39;s
congenital amaurosis. There&#39;s no treatment for the disease, which
appears early in infancy and causes severe vision loss, especially
at night.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">An estimated 2,000 Americans have the
form of the disease they targeted, Bennett said.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">WASHINGTON -- Three young adults barely
able to see because of a congenital and progressive form of
blindness have regained modest amounts of vision after getting
genetically engineered viruses injected into their eyes, the
leaders of two independent studies reported Sunday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The results were something short of
miraculous. Three other patients showed no increase in visual
acuity, and the three who improved are still legally blind. But to
get any improvement at all during such an early phase of the
research suggests that the approach has promise for people with
gene-based forms of blindness, researchers said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The work could also provide a boost for
the field of gene therapy, which for 15 years has tried and mostly
failed to treat diseases by giving people new genes -- and in a few
high-profile cases has sickened or even killed them.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We&#39;re learning things as we go along,&quot;
said Jean Bennett of the University of Pennsylvania, who with
Albert Maguire led one of the two studies. &quot;We were not really
going for a cure. But we do view it as a success in that their
vision has improved. I&#39;d call it a dramatic response.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Others took a more conservative view,
noting that some of the key measures of improvement were subjective
and could not be conclusively linked to the therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In an editorial to appear in the New
England Journal of Medicine along with the study results, Joan
Miller of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary called the
results &quot;suggestive of efficacy.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Still, videos of some of the
experimental subjects trying to navigate through a dimly lit
obstacle course show notable improvement in the weeks and months
after the injections. Scientists said they are hopeful the
treatment will prove even more beneficial in younger patients,
whose retinas have only begun to degenerate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;If we can get any benefits in people
with such advanced disease, then when we start to treat children,
and when we treat a greater part of the retina and give a higher
dose, the expectation is we can get even better results,&quot; said
Robin Ali of University College London, who led the other
study.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Both teams are moving ahead with tests
in younger patients and at higher doses.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The experiments involve patients with
Leber&#39;s congenital amaurosis, a rare disease caused by a defect in
a single gene that is crucial to the retina&#39;s ability to convert
light into signals to the brain. Affected children have impaired
vision from birth and are typically blind by age 30.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Paul Sieving, director of the National
Eye Institute, which led the research that identified the rpe65
gene but was not involved in the latest research, said Howarth&#39;s
anecdote jibes with his observation that even modest improvements
in vision can make for big gains in the quality of one&#39;s life.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;From the numbers, you can&#39;t imagine
there&#39;s any real improvement,&quot; Sieving said. &quot;But if I give you
just a little vision, someone on the street can&#39;t even tell you
have an impairment.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">About 450 genes have been implicated in
eye diseases, Sieving said, suggesting the approach could have
potential for many.</p>

eye that senses light. Millions of North Americans suffer from
diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, retinal ischemia
and age-related macular degeneration. Although the causes differ,
these diseases all end in the same: Retinal cells die, leading to
blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researcher Catherine Tsilfidis, who&#39;s
also a University of Ottawa medical professor, has shown that a
gene called XIAP can prevent retinal cell death. The gene can be
delivered to the eye using a virus called Adeno-Associated Virus
(AAV). The goal of the project is to begin testing the therapy in
patients within the next five years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The project is being funded by the
Foundation Fighting Blindness, a private charity and the Canadian
Institutes of Health Research.</p>

he could see the colour of his eyes. Later they played soccer

less than six weeks after another breakthrough in gene vision
therapy, in which two monkeys were cured of colour blindness.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">A year after receiving gene therapy for
a condition that causes total blindness by age 30, three people
continue to see better and one has improved enough to read the
digital numbers on the clock in her parents&#39; car, U.S. researchers
said on Wednesday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Improvements in the vision of the three
volunteers -- all legally blind and in their 20s -- has not
deteriorated over time, doctors involved in the experiment reported
in New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">One of the three has also developed a
kind of &quot;second sight&quot; because her brain has learned to tap
information from an area of the retina rejuvenated by gene
therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The initial improvements were very
substantial and occurred in a matter of weeks,&quot; Dr. Artur Cideciyan
of the University of Pennsylvania said in a telephone
interview.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But in one patient, a woman, her vision
has continued to improve because her brain has apparently learned
to use information from the treated portion of the eye, allowing
her to read the clock.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s very encouraging to see that the
adult brain seems to be adapting to this vision,&quot; Cideciyan
said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The three -- two men and the woman --
suffer from a form of Leber&#39;s congenital amaurosis, an
otherwise-untreatable condition that robs infants and children of
most of their vision. All had been legally blind since birth
because a gene known as RPE65, which produces a special form of
vitamin A for retinal cells, was defective.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The experiment was one of several
attempts by various research teams to fix genetic problems by
injecting properly functioning DNA into a virus and using the virus
to deliver the healthy DNA to individual cells.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Three months after doctors injected
patients in the eye with healthy versions of the gene, all three
patients could detect dim lights they were unable to see before the
treatment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the case of one woman, she was using
her right eye - initially her worst - to read the dashboard clock
for the first time in her life. The researchers found that she was
seeing the light using a portion of the eye that had been injected
with the healthy DNA, and not the usual spot used for reading and
seeing detail.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;She either uses her normal gaze
straight ahead or, under other conditions, she switches to this
treated area. So she has two loci for gaze and she switches between
the two. That took a while to occur,&quot; Cideciyan said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">A year after their treatments, the
therapy has not caused an immune response in the eye or in the
body, the team said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The researchers will continue to monitor
the patients over several years and are experimenting with other
patients to see if injecting different amounts of DNA is more
effective.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Leber congenital amaurosis type 2
affects about 2,000 people in the U.S. and is one of several
incurable forms of blindness collectively known as retinitis
pigmentosa.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Dagmar Jamieson dreams of the day when
she may see her son face clearly. Legally blind and diagnosed with
Stargardt macular dystrophy, also known as Stargardt&#39;s Disease, her
central vision is obscured.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s like someone put Vaseline in the
middle of the lenses on my glasses,&quot; she says.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">More than two million Canadians suffer
from some form of visual impairment. Stargardt&#39;s Disease is an
inherited eye disorder that causes the loss of central vision and
affects people in their pre-teen or teen years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Jamieson first noticed that something
was wrong when she started Grade 5.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">She had trouble seeing the blackboard
and the teacher&#39;s face. Things slowly eroded from that point on
and, after countless tests, she was declared legally blind.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It was a shocking experience and no one
in my family knew how to deal with it,&quot; she says. &quot;I was a young
individual heading into my teenage years and it was somewhat
devastating. I struggled with admitting I was blind for many
years.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Now married with a 10-year-old son named
Alex, Jamieson finds creative ways of coping.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Because I have peripheral vision, I can
walk around quite well. I love to entertain and cook, and some of
my friends don&#39;t even know that I can&#39;t see.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Voice-activated and specialized
technology also helps her live a relatively normal life, although
some common situations can be very difficult.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I force myself to walk into rooms (at
social functions) where I don&#39;t know anyone. It can be very
intimidating because I can&#39;t recognize faces. However, things
usually have a way of working out,&quot; she says.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;When Alex was young and we were in a
room full of people, he would come up and pat me on the leg so that
I knew he was there.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">While Jamieson has adapted and adjusted
to her blindness, she knows that she is missing out.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Thanks to recent medical research
developments, she now has hope that someday she may actually see
Alex&#39;s smile. Recent gene therapy clinical trials in the U.S. and
United Kingdom have shown that gene therapy may help treat
inherited blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">She says, &quot;I believe that one therapy or
breakthrough will open doors for others. I can&#39;t even begin to
express what it would mean to me if I could see. It would
absolutely make a difference in my life and in the lives of people
around me.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Bill Stell, professor at the
University of Calgary faculty of medicine and director of research
for the Foundation Fighting Blindness explains how this treatment
works.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Gene therapy is simply a way of
treating disease by introducing new genes into diseased tissue so
that the product of the new gene combats the disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Most commonly, the treatment is for a
&#39;loss-of-function&#39; or genetically recessive function. That is, a
gene that provides an essential function has been damaged, so its
function has to be replaced.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">This is what was done in the recent
trials for gene therapy of LCA (Leber Congenital Amaurosis).&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;There are many people who are still
buried under the depressing outcome of vision loss,&quot; says Jamieson.
&quot;However, these new studies are raising hope for treatment.
Blindness is associated with a white cane and it&#39;s so much more
than that. It&#39;s very surprising to know how many people are
suffering from vision loss in one sense or another.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">While Dr. Stell and Jamieson are
optimistic that more clinical trials and research will bring great
progress in treating Stargardt&#39;s Disease and other visual
impairments, the reality is that research is expensive.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">To that end, the Foundation Fighting
Blindness is hosting a special fundraising event called IN/Sight --
Dining in the Dark on Oct. 2 at the Hotel Arts.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The evening promises to be a feast of
the senses that invites patrons to enjoy some of the evening
blindfolded. The dinner includes a gourmet menu, paired with a
specialty wine list overseen by wine critic Geoff Last from Bin
905.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">A highlight promises to be the premiere
of Fade to Light written and directed by Calgary&#39;s award-wining
playwright and Calgary Herald columnist Eugene Stickland. Heard
entirely in the dark, it is a poetic meditation on the nature of
vision featuring two voices, male and female, as well as a
piano.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Without sight, your other senses are
heightened,&quot; Jamieson says. &quot;People will be wearing blindfolds
throughout dinner and the play. There are restaurants around the
world that have been using this concept of enjoying food
blindfolded. You become a lot of more aware and in tune with the
experience. You are forced to slow down, enjoy the food and
miraculously, no one spills!&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">IN/Sight -- Dining in the Dark takes
place on the eve of the 2008 Alberta Vision Science Symposium and
many renowned scientists will be in attendance at the event.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Money raised will stay in Western Canada
and fund the Stargardt Project headed up by Dr. Bob Molday at the
University of British Columbia.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;This research not only provides the
evidence on which future therapy for Stargardt-like disorders will
be based, sparing teens from the devastating consequences of
early-onset, progressive blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But it also will provide invaluable
information and experience that will accelerate the development of
gene therapies for other disorders,&quot; Stell says.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">For Jamieson and others like her, it
will be an evening full of hope and light.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Three young adults barely able to see
because of a congenital and progressive form of blindness have
regained modest amounts of vision after getting genetically
engineered viruses injected into their eyes, the leaders of two
independent studies reported.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Three other patients showed no increase
in visual acuity, and the three who improved are still legally
blind. But to get any improvement during such an early phase of
research suggests the approach has promise for people with
gene-based forms of blindness, researchers said. The work could
also provide a boost for the field of gene therapy, which for 15
years has tried to treat diseases by giving people new genes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We&#39;re learning things as we go along,&quot;
said Jean Bennett of the University of Pennsylvania, who helped

But we do view it as a success in that their vision has improved.
I&#39;d call it a dramatic response.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Others noted some of the key measures of
improvement were subjective and could not be conclusively linked to
the therapy. In an editorial to appear in the New England Journal
of Medicine, Joan Miller of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary
called the results &quot;suggestive of efficacy.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Still, videos of some of the subjects
trying to navigate through a dimly lit obstacle course show notable
improvement after the injections.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Hundreds of thousands of people with
failing eyesight have been given fresh hope of a cure after gene
therapy techniques were used to treat a teenager.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The treatment transformed the life of a
visually impaired 18-year-old. Healthy genes were injected into one
eye, leading to a significant improvement.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The technique could be ready for use
within two years to treat people suffering from some inherited
diseases of the retina.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Within five years it could be ready for
testing on people who suffer age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the trial carried out by a team at
the University College of London and Moorfields Eye Hospital, the
world&#39;s first gene transplant for blindness produced an
unprecedented improvement in Steven Howarth&#39;s sight.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The student suffered from a genetic
mutation called Leber&#39;s congenital amaurosis, which usually begins
affecting sight in early childhood and eventually causes total
blindness during a patient&#39;s 20s or 30s.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Born with no peripheral or night vision,
Howarth noticed an improvement after the two-hour operation. &quot;Now,
my sight when it&#39;s getting dark or it&#39;s badly lit is definitely
better,&quot; he says. &quot;It&#39;s a small change -- but it makes a big
difference.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The doctors injected genes only into
Howarth&#39;s worse affected eye and used the lowest dose in what was
strictly a safety trial.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Prof. Robin Ali, head of the research
team, said he believes this is a proof of principle for treating a
vast range of blinding conditions, from 100 other inherited kinds
to the most common of all, age-related macular degeneration.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Gene therapy for a rare type of
inherited blindness has improved the vision of four patients who
tried it, boosting hopes for the troubled field of gene repair
technology, scientists said yesterday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Two separate teams of doctors reported
successes in using gene therapy to treat Leber congenital
amaurosis, or LCA.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">LCA damages light receptors in the
retina. It usually begins affecting sight in early childhood and
causes total blindness by the time a patient is 30. There is no
treatment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Both teams used a common cold virus to
deliver a normal version of one damaged gene that causes the
disease, called RPE65, directly into the eyes of patients.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Although both trials were only testing
for safety, patients reported they could see a little better
afterwards, the researchers told a meeting of eye specialists in
Florida and also reported in the New England Journal of
Medicine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Katherine High of the Children&#39;s
Hospital of Philadelphia and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute
and colleagues said all three of their volunteers had improved
vision after the treatments.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Robin Ali of University College
London and colleagues said one of their three volunteers got
better.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Because the patients were adults,
already had severe sight loss and received only low doses of
treatment, researchers had not expected to see a benefit at
all.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">LONDON -- Gene therapy for a rare type
of inherited blindness has improved the vision of four patients who
tried it, boosting hopes for the troubled field of gene repair
technology, scientists said Sunday. Two separate teams of doctors
reported successes in using gene therapy to treat Leber congenital
amaurosis, or LCA.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">LCA damages light receptors in the
retina. It usually begins affecting sight in early childhood and
causes total blindness by the time a patient is 30. There is no
treatment.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Scientists for the first time have used
gene therapy todramatically improve sight in people with a rare
form of blindness, a development experts called a major advance for
the experimental technique.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Some vision was restored in four of the
six young people who got the treatment, teams of researchers in the
United States and Britain reported yesterday. Two of the volunteers
who could only see hand motions were able to read a few lines of an
eye chart within weeks.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s a phenomenal breakthrough,&quot; said
Stephen Rose, chief research officer of the Foundation Fighting
Blindness, which helped pay for one study done at Children&#39;s
Hospital of Philadelphia.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If successful in larger numbers, experts
said, the technique has the potential to reverse blindness from
other kinds of inherited eye diseases.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I think this is incredibly exciting,&quot;
said Dr. Jean Bennett, a professor of ophthalmology at the
University of Pennsylvania and a leader of the Philadelphia study.
&quot;It&#39;s the beginning of a whole new phase of studies.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The research was published online
yesterday by the New England Journal of Medicine in conjunction
with presentations at a medical meeting in Florida.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The two teams of scientists, working
separately, each tested gene replacement therapy in three patients
with a form of a rare hereditary eye disease called Leber&#39;s
congenital amaurosis. There&#39;s no treatment for the disease, which
appears early in infancy and causes severe vision loss, especially
at night.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">An estimated 2,000 Americans have the
form of the disease they targeted, Bennett said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Gene therapy - replacing faulty genes
with a normal version - has been studied in humans for more than 15
years with limited success.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The early results of the eye experiments
should give the field a boost, some experts said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I think it&#39;s really a big shot in the
arm for gene therapy and for medicine in general,&quot; said Dr. Ronald
Crystal, head of genetic medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College
in New York.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Each of the study participants had
mutations in a gene that makes a protein needed by the retina,
which senses light and sends images to the brain. Those without the
gene gradually lose sight until they are blind in early
adulthood.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The retina itself stays in relatively
good shape for a while, making it a good candidate for gene
therapy, said Robin Ali, a professor at University College London,
who led the British team. He likened the defective gene to a
missing spark plug in a car engine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The whole engine can be absolutely
fine, but if it doesn&#39;t have a spark plug, the car&#39;s not going to
work,&quot; said Ali.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">For the experiment, the scientists
injected millions of copies of a working gene beneath the retina in
the back of the eye. Only one eye was treated, the worst one, in
case anything went wrong; the untreated eye was used for
comparison. After treatment, patients&#39; eyesight and light
sensitivity were measured periodically; mobility was tested in a
maze or obstacle course.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">All three of those treated in
Philadelphia showed significant improvement in their vision, the
researchers said. The volunteers - two women, 19 and 26, and a man,
26 - were from Italy, where they had been screened by researchers
there. The longest follow-up was six months.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Besides reading lines on an eye chart,
they could see better in dim light, Bennett said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We were not expecting to restore their
vision to 20/20,&quot; she said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the British group, the treatment only
worked in 18-year-old Steven Howarth, whose disease was less
advanced than the other two - a girl, 17, and a man, 23, who was
followed for a year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Howarth said he used to rush home from
school because he was worried about getting around in the dark,
according to remarks issued by the university.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Now, my sight when it&#39;s getting dark or
it&#39;s badly lit is definitely better. It&#39;s a small change, but it
makes a big difference to me,&quot; said Howarth, who lives in Bolton,
near Manchester.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">After the injection last July, Howarth
said his eye felt like sandpaper. It was better after a week, and
his eyesight gradually improved. He was able to negotiate a dimly
lit maze in 14 seconds without bumping into any obstacles; before
it took him 77 seconds with eight errors.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">There were no serious side effects
reported in either group.</p>

1999 death of Jesse Gelsinger, 18, in an experiment for a liver
disorder at Penn. And some children treated for an immune disorder
called &quot;bubble boy disease&quot; later developed leukemia.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Besides reading lines on an eye chart,
they could see better in dim light, Bennett said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We were not expecting to restore their
vision to 20/20,&quot; she said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the British group, the treatment only
worked in 18-year-old Steven Howarth, whose disease was less
advanced than the other two -- a girl, 17; and a man, 23, who was
followed for a year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Howarth said he used to rush home from
school because he was worried about getting around in the dark,
according to remarks issued by the university.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Now, my sight when it&#39;s getting dark or
it&#39;s badly lit is definitely better. It&#39;s a small change -- but it
makes a big difference to me,&quot; said Howarth, who lives in Bolton,
near Manchester.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">After the injection last July, Howarth
said his eye felt like sandpaper. It was better after a week, and
his eyesight gradually improved. He was able to negotiate a dimly
lit maze in 14 seconds without bumping into any obstacles; before
it took him 77 seconds with eight errors.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">There were no serious side effects
reported in either group. One of the patients in Philadelphia
developed a hole in his retina which didn&#39;t affect his eyesight.
The researchers think the hole was related to the surgery and not
the injected gene.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The researchers said there was no
evidence that the altered virus used to ferry the gene into the
retina&#39;s cells had travelled outside the eye to other areas of the
body.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The groups have each treated a fourth
patient, including a preteen in England. The researchers hope to
see better results with higher doses and in younger patients with
less eye damage.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The U.S. National Eye Institute is
funding a third similar study at the University of Florida.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The research in Philadelphia and London
was paid for by a variety of government agencies and private
foundations. An employee of Targeted Genetics Corp., which made the
altered virus used in London, is a co-author of their report. Four
of the Philadelphia researchers, including Bennett, have either
applied for or have patents related to gene therapy. Ali and
another British researcher have also applied for a patent for the
procedure.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">McGill University researcher Robert
Koenekoop&#39;s discovery of a new gene linked to congenital blindness
couldn&#39;t have come at a better time.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The publication on Sunday in the journal
Nature Genetics of his and his colleagues&#39; findings on LCA5, one of
the genes responsible for Leber Congenital Amaurosis, or LCA, the
leading cause of congenital blindness in infants and small
children, comes only weeks after the start of the first human gene
therapy trial.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">That trial, under way in London and
Philadelphia, will attempt to replace another defective gene linked
to LCA - known as RPE65 - but has implications for the five per
cent of LCA patients whose disease is linked to the gene Koenekopp
discovered, and for the rest of the 200,000 people worldwide born
with LCA, half of whom are in Canada.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Until a few years ago ... we didn&#39;t
know anything about what caused the disease and we had absolutely
no treatments or even any ideas,&quot; Koenekoop, who heads the McGill
Ocular Genetics Centre, said yesterday.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">It took nine years to bring RPE65 from
gene discovery to the human clinical trial stage, but Koenekoop is
hoping to do the same for LCA5 in only two or three years. Gene
replacement trials on lab mice are to begin at McGill this
summer.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">For Khadija Hilali the news that
researchers had identified the specific gene that caused her
7-year-old daughter Ikrame to be born partially blind was
exhilarating.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I can&#39;t describe my feelings when I
heard it,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s very important because when you identify
the gene responsible for the illness, it will be easier to treat
it.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Ikrame was one of two children studied
by Koenekoop and his international team, which included MUHC
molecular biologist Irma Lopez, Frans Cremers and Anneke den
Hollander of Radboud University Nijmegen in the Netherlands, and
others.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">A new, faster method of combing a
patient&#39;s DNA to identify identical genome variations on the
mother&#39;s and father&#39;s side using collections of microscopic DNA
spots known as microarrays allowed the scientists to use samples
from only one patient per family whereas in the past locating a
gene required doing genetic tests on many affected and unaffected
family members and could take years, not months.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Once they narrowed down an area of the
genome that had 10 possibly LCA-linked genes they looked for
similarities with another known LCA gene called CEP290, which
accounts for 25 per cent of LCA cases and was discovered by
Koenekopp&#39;s team last year. That led them to the new gene, which is
the 11th to be linked to LCA thus far. (In each patient, LCA is
caused by only one of these genes.)</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;What we&#39;re excited about is that these
11 genes we now know (about) take care of about 70 to 75 per cent
of all the children in the world with LCA,&quot; Koenekoop said. &quot;We&#39;re
thinking this is the first disease that will be completely
characterized genetically.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The recent study, funded in part by the
Foundation Fighting Blindness in Canada, also showed that both LCA5
and CEP290 play a vital role in the functioning of the cilium, the
tiny hairs whose wave-like motion moves thousands of proteins from
the nucleus of the retina&#39;s photoreceptors to an area called the
outer segment, where light is captured and vision begins.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;When you have mutations in LCA5 or
CEP290 the vital proteins that make our vision work cannot get from
the nucleus to the outer segment,&quot; Koenekoop said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Gene replacement therapy would restore
that transporting function. The eye is especially suited to such
therapy because it is more accessible than other organs to a
surgical intervention and is isolated.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">That means the healthy gene, packaged in
a safe, non-infectious virus, can easily be injected in a tiny
space underneath the retina and will not spread to other parts of
the body through the veins, as is the case with gene therapy using
bone marrow, thus avoiding aggravating the immune system.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The surgery is relatively simple, but
the actual construction of the gene is complex,&quot; Koenekoop
said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Replacement of the RPE65 gene in dogs
suffering from LCA has also shown that the healthy gene need only
restore the retina partially to improve vision to a functional
level.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Body &amp; Health</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">LONDON -- The world&#39;s first attempt to
treat blindness by transplanting genes into the eye has started in
London.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital has
begun the pioneering attempt to treat a sight disorder using gene
therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">On Tuesday they disclosed they had
carried out genetic surgery a few weeks ago on Robert Johnson, a
civil servant based in London who was born with a sight disorder
that deteriorates with age.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Johnson, who had genes inserted into
just one eye, can see outlines during the day, but little at
night.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">However, it will be months before the
researchers know whether the cutting-edge technique has worked.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s very difficult to say how I&#39;m
feeling. I keep ranging from extreme nervousness to a bit of
excitement,&quot; Johnson, 23, told the BBC.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If this gene therapy is successful,
scientists believe that the technology could be adapted to treat a
range of sight disorders, including age-related macular
degeneration, one of the most common causes of blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The trial, which has received funding
from the Department of Health, involves a dozen adults and children
who have a condition called Leber&#39;s congenital amaurosis, which
affects one in 100,000 babies. Sight deteriorates to such a degree
that many sufferers go blind as adults. The culprit is a gene
called RPE65, which stops the retina, the layer of cells at the
back of the eye that detect light, from working.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Lead researcher professor Robin Ali,
based at the Institute of Ophthalmology, has spent 15 years working
with colleagues developing the technique.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I can&#39;t help feeling somewhat
apprehensive,&quot; he said. &quot;There is so much riding on it and we have
all been waiting for a very long time.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">His colleague, James Bainbridge,
injected the normal genes into the retina, using a harmless virus
or &quot;vector&quot; to slip the gene into the cells.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The operation, which took three hours,
required great precision as Mr Johnson&#39;s retina was detached to
allow the virus to infect the cells.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Robert Maclaren, the assistant surgeon,
said he was pleased with how the procedure went.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The technique has been successful in the
lab and on animals. Dogs that had the defect had their sight
improved so much that they could walk through a maze alone.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Some indications of the results of the
trial may be available within several months,&quot; said retinal
specialist Prof Tony Moore, a member of the team.&quot;However, the
subjects will need to be followed up to assess the long-term effect
of the treatment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We anticipate the best outcome in
younger patients, as we will be treating the disease in the early
stages of its development.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Health minister Lord Hunt described the
trial as a &quot;global first.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;This trial ... could mean the ability
to restore sight to children with this condition. The U.K. leads
Europe in gene therapy, with over 40 per cent of clinical trials,
and we are second only to the U.S.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Professor Leonard Seymour, president of
the British Society for Gene Therapy, said: &quot;These early trials are
really aiming to slow down deterioration of vision.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It is only by performing clinical
studies such as these that we can identify what we need to do to
correct the problem altogether,&quot; he added.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Professor Martin Gore, chairman of the
Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, which approved the procedure, said
gene therapy was conceived for the treatment of single-gene
disorders.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;In practice, more than 70 per cent of
gene therapy trials have been for cancer. This trial demonstrates
that the original ideas behind gene therapy are still very much
alive.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Nearly three years after the devastating
news that her baby boy was blind, Nadine Seed is hopeful the veil
of darkness could one day be lifted.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">She owes that hope to eight siblings in
Valleyfield, Que., whose brush with same disease led researchers to
the gene that is the most common cause of blindness among
newborns.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I thank God that they came forward,&#39;&#39;
the Edmonton mother said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers at McGill University Health
Centre in Montreal and the University of Nijmegen in the
Netherlands were able to identify the gene, CEP290, after testing
the Quebec family, half of whom are blind.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In subsequent testing, researchers found
the mutated gene present in 25 per cent of patients with the
congenital disorder LCA (Leber congenital amaurosis).</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Each gene discovery is important because
it offers information about how the retina works and how disease
occurs, said Dr. Robert Koenekoop, director of the McGill Ocular
Genetics Centre in Montreal.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But the discovery of CEP290 is a major
step in understanding hereditary blindness, he said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We can now describe the genetic basis
of hereditary blindness in babies in up to 75 per cent of cases and
that&#39;s spectacular,&#39;&#39; said Koenekoop.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I would say this is the single most
important gene for congenital blindness just based on numbers,
frequency and impact.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Children with LCA lose their vision
because the gene defects cause the cells in the eye to die or
malfunction. They have trouble fixing on objects and their eyes
appear to jiggle in their sockets.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The disorder affects one in 30,000
newborns. About 10,000 young Canadians and 150,000 people around
the world suffer from the hereditary disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Seed and her husband, Mike, know the
heartbreak of the diagnosis personally.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Her son, Erick, was diagnosed at about
four months after her mother noticed something wrong.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I had never had a baby before and
thought all new babies had really kind of roving eyes,&#39;&#39; she
said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;All of a sudden our whole world turned
upside down and our whole paradigm of us as parents and us as a
family completely shifted.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But Seed&#39;s despair turned to hope after
Koenekoop called this year to say her son had the CEP290 gene.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It was the second best group of news
that I could ever hear in my whole life -- the first being that my
son could see.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The discovery last July of the ninth
gene responsible for LCA means gene therapy treatment may be
developed that could partially restore vision.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The Foundation Fighting Blindness, which
partially funds Koenekoop&#39;s research, is delighted.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It certainly brings great hope for the
future for our families,&#39;&#39; said executive director Sharon
Colle.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The first human gene replacement therapy
trial for vision is slated to take place in Philadelphia in January
on another LCA gene - - RPE65.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If successful, it could lead to a
treatment for the million patients around the world who suffer from
juvenile and adult forms of the congenital ailment.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In animal studies, researchers have
found 30 per cent of sight can be restored with gene therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The gene discovery also opens the
possibility of prevention, Koenekoop said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">For families who fear giving birth to
another blind child, in vitro fertilization coupled with genetic
screening of embryos would dramatically reduce that risk. &quot;We can
prevent children from being born with this devastating disease,&#39;&#39;
Koenekoop told a Montreal newspaper.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But the option is not without
controversy. There is a great deal of debate over screening of
embryos for disease and genetic defect, a practice critics call
unethical in part because it raises the spectre of sex
selection.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">MONTREAL (CP) - Nearly three years after
the devastating news that her baby boy was blind, Nadine Seed is
hopeful the veil of darkness could one day be lifted.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">She owes that hope to eight siblings in
Valleyfield, Que., whose brush with same disease led researchers to
the gene that is the most common cause of blindness among
newborns.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I thank God that they came forward,&quot;
the Edmonton mother said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers at McGill University Health
Centre in Montreal and the University of Nijmegen in the
Netherlands were able to identify the gene, CEP290, after testing
the Quebec family, half of whom are blind.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In subsequent testing, researchers found
the mutated gene present in 25 per cent of patients with the
congenital disorder LCA (Leber congenital amaurosis).</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Each gene discovery is important because
it offers information about how the retina works and how disease
occurs, said Dr. Robert Koenekoop, director of the McGill Ocular
Genetics Centre in Montreal.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But the discovery of CEP290 is a major
step in understanding hereditary blindness, he said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We can now describe the genetic basis
of hereditary blindness in babies in up to 75 per cent of cases and
that&#39;s spectacular,&quot; said Koenekoop.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I would say this is the single most
important gene for congenital blindness just based on numbers,
frequency and impact.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">TORONTO (CP) -- It&#39;s one of those
questions that has baffled humans for millennia: What came first,
the chicken or the egg? For scientists seeking a way to give sight
to genetically blind chickens, it was definitely the egg.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers from the University of
Florida injected healthy genes through the eggshells of chickens
with an inherited disorder that causes them to be born blind. When
the treated chicks hatched, not only could they see, but their
vision was &quot;amazing,&quot; said neuroscientist Sue Semple-Rowland, the
principal researcher.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">More importantly, the gene-transfer
raises high hopes for developing a treatment to restore sight in
children with a similar condition, called Leber congenital
amaurosis Type 1, or LCA1.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I firmly believe this will work,&quot;
Semple-Rowland said from Gainesville, Fla. &quot;We&#39;re really, really
close to making it possible to treat kids with various forms of LCA
with gene therapy and have them have a relatively normal life in
terms of vision.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">While there is much work still to be
done, she predicted a treatment for humans could come within just a
few years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The breakthrough with the chickens took
20 years of painstaking work by Semple-Rowland and her colleagues
to determine what caused the birds&#39; blindness, to isolate the
defective gene and then to figure out how to fix it.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Her lab modified a virus to carry a
normal copy of the gene that is defective in the chickens, a type
of Rhode Island Red. After boring tiny holes in the shells of
fertilized eggs, they injected a small quantity of the virus into
the neural tubes of two-day-old embryos, closed up the holes with a
waxed substance and waited for them to hatch almost three weeks
later.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Of seven chicks injected in-utero, six
could see after hatching, said the scientists, whose research is
published online In the journal Public Library of
Science-Medicine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The blind animals just stand there,
obviously,&quot; Semple-Rowland said. &quot;These animals&#39; performance
visually was spectacular. Their ability to peck targets, very small
ones, was amazing to me.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Among the vision tests is one in which
the birds are set near white paper marked with tiny dots. The
chicks headed for the paper and began pecking the dots as if they
were feed, she said. &quot;They had great binocular vision. We know this
because their accuracy was very good.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Still, the treatment isn&#39;t yet
perfected. By four months of age, all the chickens had lost their
sight when light-receptor cells in the retina, which allow humans
and other species to see, began to degenerate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Semple-Rowland said that&#39;s because the
injected virus appears to have genetically repaired less than half
of the light-receptor cells in the birds&#39; retinas, leaving the rest
defective. Those defective cells eventually caused their healthy
neighbours to degrade.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But she doesn&#39;t believe that would
happen in children carrying the mutated LCA1 gene -- who would be
treated after birth, likely any time up to age five -- because a
gene-transfer therapy would be injected through the eyeball to
flood the area directly underneath the retina.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Children with LCA1 can be born blind or
have some sight that is gradually lost. There are several types of
LCA-related blindness, which affects three in every 100,000 people
worldwide, accounting for about 20 per cent of children in schools
for the visually impaired, says the Toronto-based Foundation
Fighting Blindness of Canada.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;This is very exciting,&quot; said Dr. Elise
Heon, chief of ophthalmology at Toronto&#39;s Hospital for Sick
Children, commenting on the research. &quot;It&#39;s really a wonderful
proof of principle that you can restore visual function in an
inherited blinding disorder.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Heon, calling Semple-Rowland a
&quot;visionary&quot; because she fought without funding to keep breeding the
blind Rhode Island Reds over the last two decades, said her team&#39;s
work shines a ray of light beyond just children with LCA-related
blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;What it shows is that there&#39;s really
hope also for other (genetically-related) retinal diseases ... Now
many groups throughout the world will be working on this to target
other similar diseases.&quot;</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Of seven chicks injected in-utero, six
could see after hatching, said the scientists, whose research is
published online today in the journal Public Library of
Science-Medicine.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The blind animals just stand there,
obviously,&quot; Semple-Rowland said. &quot;These animals&#39; performance
visually was spectacular. Their ability to peck targets, very small
ones, was amazing to me.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Among the vision tests is one in which
the birds are set near white paper marked with tiny dots. The
chicks headed for the paper and began pecking the dots as if they
were feed, she said. &quot;They had great binocular vision. We know this
because their accuracy was very good.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Still, the treatment isn&#39;t yet
perfected. By four months of age, all the chickens had lost their
sight when light-receptor cells in the retina, which allow humans
and other species to see, began to degenerate.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Semple-Rowland said that&#39;s because the
injected virus appears to have genetically repaired less than half
of the light-receptor cells in the birds&#39; retinas, leaving the rest
defective. Those defective cells eventually caused their healthy
neighbours to degrade.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But she doesn&#39;t believe that would
happen in children carrying the mutated LCA1 gene - who would be
treated after birth, likely any time up to age five - because a
gene-transfer therapy would be injected through the eyeball to
flood the area directly underneath the retina.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Children with LCA1 can be born blind or
have some sight that is gradually lost. There are several types of
LCA-related blindness, which affects three in every 100,000 people
worldwide, accounting for about 20 per cent of children in schools
for the visually impaired, says the Toronto-based Foundation
Fighting Blindness of Canada.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">The Human Genome Project, a massive
international collaboration that mapped out the 30,000 or so genes
in the human body, jump- started the identification of optical
disease genes. These include genes for retinal diseases such as
retinitis pigmentosa and macular degeneration.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Retinitis pigmentosa is a group of
diseases that causes gradual vision loss. Its name comes from the
speckled appearance of diseased retinas.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The disease affects about three million
people worldwide. Although the progression of the human disease can
be slowed by vitamin and Omega-3 therapies, no cure yet exists.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But researchers are excited. Retinitis
pigmentosa has been slowed, halted and, in some cases, even
reversed in mice, rats and dogs.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;There is so much information coming
from the animal studies we are hopeful that now is the time to
carefully translate this to human studies,&quot; says Dr. Robert
Koenekoop of the Montreal Children&#39;s Hospital. His team recently
identified a French Canadian retinitis pigmentosa gene.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We&#39;re at the point that insulin was 100
years ago when Banting started thinking of injecting insulin in
patients with diabetes. He didn&#39;t know the dose. He didn&#39;t know how
to inject it. He</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">didn&#39;t know it was safe. That&#39;s where we
are now with retinitis pigmentosa, and hopefully gene therapy will
have the same success.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">More than 50 genes identified with
retinitis pigmentosa, thought to be a single gene disease, have
been identified and researchers believe 200 or 300 such genes
exist.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We have a lifetime of work ahead of
us,&quot; says Koenekoop, who is also a professor of ophthalmology at
Montreal&#39;s McGill University.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Unfortunately, the disease is gene
specific. This means that if a patient has defective gene A, it
must be replaced with gene A and not gene B. Patients will have to
be categorized should gene therapy in humans prove to be safe and
effective.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The Hospital for Sick Children in
Toronto is piloting a project to build a genetic registry of people
with retinal diseases.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Even if gene therapy were not approved,
gene identification is important, says Koenekoop, who is part of an
international effort to develop the first diagnostic chip for
retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Some retinitis pigmentosa gene mutations
cause a disease that progresses rapidly; other forms take hold more
gradually. Knowing how the disease is likely to progress can help
parents decide if a child needs to go to a school with training for
the visually impaired. Families affected by retinitis pigmentosa
may want prenatal screening or to know which family members carry
the disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The retinitis pigmentosa diagnostic chip
is the size of a glass slide used under microscopes. It is encoded
with known retinitis pigmentosa genes and their many mutations. For
example, congenital retinitis pigmentosa, which affects children
and infants, is associated with about 350 mutations of seven known
genes. All of those mutations are encoded on a chip. The DNA test
costs about $200.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Koenekoop and his colleagues developed a
chip for recessive retinitis pigmentosa which tests for 450
mutations of 15 genes. The research group is also developing chips
for dominant retinitis pigmentosa and a sex-linked form of the
disease that leads to blindness in boys.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Gene identification helps scientists
determine the complex interplay of genes and cells. One day
scientists may be able to prevent genes, such as the newly
identified French Canadian gene, from killing off cells. Known as
apoptosis, this process normally destroys surplus cells and occurs
naturally in the body. However, it is not natural when the kill-off
continues unabated, as it does in retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">It is possible that retinitis pigmentosa
can be at least partially cured, but this may only happen in
children, says Koenekoop. &quot;Our first step was going to be stopping
the disease cold and that seems a very reasonable goal. But we
already know from the dog studies with juvenile retinitis
pigmentosa that we can partly reverse it.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">He is referring to the dogs affected by
congenital night blindness that received gene therapy in an
experiment involving the University of Pennsylvania&#39;s Scheie
Institute, Cornell University and the University of Florida. This
canine degenerative eye disease found only in the Briard dog breed
is genetically similar to a childhood retinal disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;The spectacular thing is it was one
small injection,&quot; Koenekoop says of a trial in which the dogs were
treated in one eye but not the other.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Nothing happened for three months, but
then some of the dogs started to catch balls. Several years later,
the treated eyes remained stable and the control eyes had gone
blind. Human trials of this therapy are expected to begin this
year.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Gene therapy has many hurdles, not the
least of which is the potential of an over-reaction by the body&#39;s
immune system to a transplanted gene. Another concern is that the
eye is part of the brain. Genetic watchdogs want to be certain that
viruses modified to act as a vehicle for the implanted genes are
truly inactive.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Robert Molday, director of the
Centre for Macular Research at the University of British Columbia,
is part of an international collaboration that used gene therapy to
prevent blindness in mice with retinoschisis -- a rare genetic
disorder that causes the retina to split. This devastating form of
blindness destroys central vision in boys.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Subsequent to safety, we have to make
sure that gene therapy actually works and is beneficial,&quot; says
Molday. &quot;After that will be the problem of economics. Who is going
to pay?&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the war against blindness, gene
therapy could be huge because macular degeneration is also a
target. Last year, three independent studies identified a gene that
dramatically increases the likelihood for people to develop
age-related macular degeneration -- the leading cause of blindness
in the industrialized world.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">In what may be an important step toward
preventing blindness in old age, scientists have identified a gene
believed to be responsible for a degenerative eye disease that
could strike millions of baby boomers as they grow older.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The gene is suspected of being the main
cause of some cases of age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, a
complex disease triggered by various factors. It typically affects
people 65 and older.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers at Oregon Health &amp;
Science University were able to pinpoint the gene by tracking it
through a large extended family with a history of the disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We were really lucky to get a single
family that large with 10 affected members,&#39;&#39; said Dennis Schultz,
an Oregon Health &amp; Science University biochemist who led the
research at the university&#39;s Casey Eye Institute.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In age-related macular degeneration, the
most sensitive area of the retina breaks down, robbing a person of
the fine vision needed to read a book or recognize a face. In
severe cases, it can lead to almost total blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">About six million Americans have AMD, a
number that is predicted to double by 2030 as the baby boomer
generation ages. There are treatments for the disease, but the goal
is prevention.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Johanna Seddon, a Harvard
researcher, said more studies will have to be done to establish
whether the gene is the single source of some cases of AMD. If the
gene proves to be the source, it is possible gene therapy could be
used to delay or even prevent the disease, she said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;But I think that&#39;s still quite a way
off,&#39;&#39; Seddon said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The study was published Tuesday in the
online version of the journal Human Molecular Genetics and will
appear in print in the December issue.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Genes that play a role in forms of
macular degeneration that affect younger people have been
identified. But this is the first solid evidence of a genetic cause
for the age-related form, researchers said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I think it&#39;s really exciting,&#39;&#39; said
Dr. Michael Gorin, a University of Pittsburgh eye specialist and
leading AMD researcher. &quot;This is an important step along the long
and arduous path toward understanding the complexity of this
disease.&#39;&#39;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But he warned there are many other
factors that contribute to age- related macular degeneration,
including other genes, as well as environmental factors, such as
smoking.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In a related study announced Monday, a
University of Kentucky researcher said he has created for the first
time genetically modified mice that have virtually all the
important features of AMD. That could advance research on the
disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The study by Jayakrishna Ambati and his
team will be published in the November issue of Nature

<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers have given four blind dogs
at least partial vision by injecting genes into the dogs&#39; retinas.
This is the first time that scientists have made blind animals see,
and the success paves the way for a treatment for humans with some
forms of congenital blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s very exciting,&quot; said Dr. Jean
Bennett, associate professor of ophthalmology at the University of
Pennsylvania School of Medicine and lead author of a study reported
in the current issue of Nature Genetics. &quot;We are very happy with
the results and hope that this technique will work in children.&quot;
The finding appears to hold promise for newborns with an inherited
genetic disease called leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA. With
LCA, the retina is not able to process information.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Each year, LCA affects about 10,000
children in the United States. They are born blind or with very
little sight.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The dogs in the Nature Genetics study
were Briards, a breed known to have a genetic mutation responsible
for about 10 per cent of LCA cases. Each of the four had LCA, and
was treated in only the right eye.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Bennett collaborated with Cornell
University researchers who originally cloned the gene, and
scientists at the University of Florida made the virus that would
carry it into the retina, where it would take on its new job
producing the healthy version of a protein involved in delivering
the visual message from the retina to the brain for processing.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The dogs&#39; retinal activity was measured
electronically four months after the gene therapy. A light was
shone into the treated eyes, and the results indicated normal
retinal activity.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We found ... evidence that the signal
was transferred to the brain,&quot; Bennett said. &quot;The brain could
understand what the eye was seeing.&quot; Researchers also put the dogs
into a room with furniture. The treated animals managed to avoid
the objects to their right, even as the untreated dogs bumped into
the obstacles.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers will now study whether there
are any side effects of the gene therapy technique. If not, human
trials could be a few years away. &quot;This is an obvious treatment and
we hope this remarkable progress will be translated to humans,&quot;
Bennett said, adding the animals are still showing evidence of
sight, nine months later.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Scientists have restored vision in dogs
with a version of a rare disease that blinds human infants by using
gene therapy. The work may lead to treatments for genetic forms of
blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The dogs had a version of Leber
congenital amaurosis, an untreatable condition that causes near
total blindness in infancy. Perhaps 10,000 Americans have it, and
about 1,000 of them have the particular genetic defect corrected in
the dogs, said researcher Dr. Jean Bennett.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If the gene therapy works in Leber
patients, it might pave the way for treating a variety of
hereditary vision diseases that strike the retina, known
collectively as retinitis pigmentosa, which affects 100,000 to
200,000 Americans, said Dr. Gerald Chader, chief scientific officer
of the Foundation Fighting Blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It should open the floodgates,&quot; said
Chader, whose organization helped finance the research.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Bennett, associate professor of
ophthalmology the University of Pennsylvania, and colleagues report
their experiments on three Briard dogs in the May issue of journal
Nature Genetics.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">She said she hopes initial experiments
in people can begin within about two years.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The dogs were blind because they lacked
a particular gene. Without it, their eyes could not make a pigment
necessary to perceive light. The therapy was designed to deliver
working copies of the gene to their eyes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers used eye surgery to deliver
a dose of the gene, carried by a virus that deposited the gene
within eye cells. They treated one eye in each animal and used the
other eye for comparison.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Four months after treatment, several
tests showed the animals had regained at least some sight in the
treated eye. Most dramatically, the dogs were allowed to wander in
a room cluttered with furniture. The dogs were much better at
avoiding objects on the same side of their bodies as the treated
eye than on the other side.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">Dogs born blind are seeing the world for
the first time after scientists injected new genes into their
eyes.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The unprecedented feat has electrified
the families of the nearly 10,000 Americans born with the same
disease -- and hundreds of thousands of others with closely related
forms of blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The work, led by researchers at the
University of Pennsylvania, marks the first time that congenital
blindness has been reversed in an animal larger than a mouse.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">It suggests that a single injection into
the eye may someday restore vision in children born with the
genetic disorder -- called Leber congenital amaurosis -- one of
several incurable forms of blindness collectively known as
retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Doctors said they suspect that similar
gene therapy treatments could prove curative for many of the
150,000 Americans suffering from that broad family of diseases, all
of which involve a deterioration of the light-detecting retina in
the back of the eye.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">If ongoing studies in dogs go well, the
researchers said, the first human studies could begin in the next
three to four years.</p>

mean, basically these dogs were blind and now they are not blind

<p style="margin-top:0px">But many questions need to be answered
before doctors can justify human studies, experts said.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">A group of American scientists has for
the first time restored vision in a trio of Briard dogs that were
born blind.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The successful gene therapy treatment in
dogs, born with a condition that closely resembles the rare human
condition called Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), has tremendous
implications not only for the small number of LCA patients, but
also for those with genetic retinal diseases and, indeed, any
genetic disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The findings, by researchers from the
University of Florida, Cornell University and the University of
Pennsylvania, are published in the May issue of Nature
Genetics.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;I would say that it&#39;s really nothing
short of miraculous,&quot; said Tom Hoglund, science communications
director at the Foundation Fighting Blindness, which helped fund
the study. &quot;You&#39;re talking about being able to restore vision in
animals that are, essentially, totally blind. This is kind of the
first fruit of the revolution in genetic medicine.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Some 2,000 people in the North America
have LCA, about 200 of them in Canada. The condition, which causes
blindness at birth or shortly thereafter, is so far
untreatable.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Scientists had already identified the
mutated gene responsible for the disease and had identified the
same problem in dogs. The scientists used an apparently harmless
virus to carry healthy copies of genes into the cells of the retina
of three puppies. The hope was that the healthy gene would produce
a protein that would translate light waves into nerve impulses,
resulting in vision for the dogs. It worked.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The gene therapy had been administered
in one eye only and afterward, the Briards, a breed of
shaggy-haired sheep dog, were able to make their way through a
maze, often turning their heads to the right, to use the eye that
worked.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It&#39;s kind of incredible,&quot; said William
Hauswirth, a contributing author and professor of molecular
genetics and microbiology at the University of Florida&#39;s College of
Medicine, as he described the excited phone call he received when
the lab workers realized the dogs could see. &quot;Although we hoped it
would happen, you never really believe it till you see it.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The findings have &quot;tremendous
implications for humans,&quot; Mr. Hoglund said, adding that the LCA
findings might also apply to sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa,
which is far more widespread. That the procedure was successful in
dogs means researchers can consider looking at other forms of
blindness.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;There&#39;s lots of disease of the eye that
could benefit from the right gene being delivered to the right
cell,&quot; Dr. Hauswirth said. &quot;The door just opened with our
demonstration that you can do this in a human-sized eye.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">He said the findings could have sweeping
effects in the broader field of gene therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;At least as important as the initial
patients&#39; benefit is that we can deliver enough gene therapy to the
human-sized eye to affect vision. That gives hope to everybody who
has a genetic disease.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It really is important for
demonstrating that it can be done -- that physically, there&#39;s
nothing that limits us to putting a gene in. The gene will be
different and may not have been discovered yet for many diseases,
but this is a big hurdle to get over.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Of course, there&#39;s still miles to go
before they can try even this procedure on humans. The first step
is a wide-ranging study on the toxicity of this treatment in small
and large animals. And, while the broad-picture science is
encouraging, the impact for the small numbers of LCA patients is
less so. That&#39;s because LCA victims&#39; retinas initially appear
normal but at some early point, cells start to die. At some point
in the cell death, Dr. Hauswirth suspects, the treatment won&#39;t
work. That means there&#39;s more hope for very young children with LCA
and even those not yet born.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;There&#39;s a window for this therapy to
work and after that, it probably won&#39;t work. We&#39;re looking at how
old a dog could be and still have vision restored.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Diseases of the retina make good
candidates for initial studies in gene therapy because the symptoms
are so obvious. People will complain of not seeing before they
complain of having only partial function of their liver, Dr.
Hauswirth said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Dr. Hauswirth&#39;s Canadian counterparts at
the University of Ottawa Eye Institute agreed this is an important
step.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;It has crossed another frontier in gene
management and gene transfer therapy,&quot; said Brian Leonard, director
of vitreoretinal surgery and founding director of the Eye
Institute. &quot;It&#39;s a very significant step and he&#39;s a world
leader.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Clinical trials on the toxicity of the
therapy will begin right away, Dr. Hauswirth said. Other funding
bodies for the study are the National Institutes of Health,
Research to Prevent Blindness and the Macular Vision Research
Foundation.</p>

<h2>Abstract (Summary)</h2>
<div>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Finding the gene is seen as only the
first step toward a cure, say [Ron Worton] and other geneticists.
In between, there&#39;s an enormous amount of research and testing.
There&#39;s the difficult task of determining what&#39;s wrong with the
errant gene. Then, there&#39;s the sticky challenge of righting the
wrong by inserting new genes into a patient gene therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the past year, researchers have found
the defective genes responsible for forms of arthritis, epilepsy
and kidney diseases. As well, they&#39;ve isolated the genetic defect
behind neurofibromatosis, a disfiguring disease sometimes called
&quot;Elephant Man&#39;s disease.&quot; Earlier this year, a team from the
Children&#39;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, led by Dr. Robert Korneluk,
discovered the defective gene that causes myotonic dystrophy, the
most common form of muscular dystrophy. Recent attempts have also
been made at gene therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">* Just this month, Michigan researchers
began gene-therapy trials to treat a 29-year-old Quebec woman who
suffers from familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition where her
liver lacks the gene that removes cholesterol from the blood. Cells
from the woman&#39;s liver were exposed to a harmless virus that was
altered to contain the cholesterol-removing gene, then billions of
these cells were re-injected in the hope the gene will start to
dramatically reduce her cholesterol levels. In experiments on
rabbits, cholesterol levels were lowered by 25 to 50 per cent.</p>

<p style="margin-top:0px">MONTREAL - GLEN CURETON IS preaching the
gospel of genetics and nothing less than the advent of a modern-day
medical miracle. Clutching a hotel ballroom podium like a lectern,
the Californian talks of a day when &quot;gene guns&quot; will shoot healthy
genes into our ailing bodies.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Want to cure cancer? he asks. Just visit
the nurse and she&#39;ll pull out her gun to inject healthy cells into
our body, knocking out nasty, diseased cells. We&#39;ll be able to go
to the corner drugstore to buy &quot;universal&quot; human cells, says the
pharmacologist-cum-businessman from the Stanford Research
Institute. A few doses of these &quot;genetically altered&quot; cells, and we
can kiss high cholesterol, high blood pressure, even AIDS,
goodbye.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">His congregation geneticists and
biotechnologists from around the world lap up this genetic gospel.
There&#39;s vigorous applause.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Researchers can barely contain their
fervor over recent advances in genetics. &quot;We&#39;re on the edge of a
revolution,&quot; says Dr. David Shindler, of the Canadian Genetic
Diseases Network, which links geneticists across the country.
&quot;There are so many possibilities.&quot;</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">But are there really? Gene therapy using
guns? Magical high cholesterol cures from the drugstore? How close
are we? People like Cureton have dates for their prophecies. We&#39;ll
have gene guns, probably by 2020, he says. While the first gene
therapy product maybe for cystic fibrosis or some types of cancer
will be on the market by 1997.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Others are far more cautious. &quot;To be
perfectly frank and honest, of the genes that have been
characterized to date that cause disease, there&#39;s not a single
example of that leading to a cure,&quot; says geneticist Dr. Ron Worton,
of Toronto&#39;s Hospital for Sick Children.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Finding the gene is seen as only the
first step toward a cure, say Worton and other geneticists. In
between, there&#39;s an enormous amount of research and testing.
There&#39;s the difficult task of determining what&#39;s wrong with the
errant gene. Then, there&#39;s the sticky challenge of righting the
wrong by inserting new genes into a patient gene therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">They caution that trumpeting an imminent
cure for a disease at the first step in the quest is creating
unrealistic expectations among sufferers of genetic diseases who
wait hopefully in the wings of science. We should view with
cautious optimism the flurry of discoveries of defective genes,
they say.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In the past year, researchers have found
the defective genes responsible for forms of arthritis, epilepsy

Children&#39;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, led by Dr. Robert Korneluk,
discovered the defective gene that causes myotonic dystrophy, the
most common form of muscular dystrophy. Recent attempts have also
been made at gene therapy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">* The first gene therapy on a human
began in late 1990. American researchers began treatment to try and
reverse a little girl&#39;s immune system disorder by giving her a
crucial gene she lacked.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">* Just this month, Michigan researchers
began gene-therapy trials to treat a 29-year-old Quebec woman who
suffers from familial hypercholesterolemia, a condition where her
liver lacks the gene that removes cholesterol from the blood. Cells
from the woman&#39;s liver were exposed to a harmless virus that was
altered to contain the cholesterol-removing gene, then billions of
these cells were re-injected in the hope the gene will start to
dramatically reduce her cholesterol levels. In experiments on
rabbits, cholesterol levels were lowered by 25 to 50 per cent.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Korneluk won&#39;t even guess how far off a
cure is for myotonic dystrophy. &quot;I don&#39;t even want to predict that.
Hopefully in our lifetime,&quot; he said.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">It&#39;s five months since he made the front
pages of newspapers across Canada for his discovery of the genetic
defect for myotonic dystrophy. It capped five years of work and
involved more than 200 researchers from four countries. He is just
beginning to unravel the complexities of the defective gene.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;Our group is still focused on the
genetics,&quot; he says. They are learning the gene is very complex. It
can change and get worse or perhaps better as it&#39;s passed from one
generation to the next.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">While he&#39;s exploring the complexities of
the gene, Korneluk says the discovery has sparked research around
the world to figure out how it functions, what messages it sends to
proteins, enzymes and muscles.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">The next step, he says, would be to
breed genetically-altered mice containing a defective myotonic
dystrophy gene. Then attempt experimental cures.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">As director of one of the fledgling
gene-therapy companies in the U.S., Doug Treco knows there are many
obstacles to gene therapy. Take the soothsayers&#39; predictions of a
cure for high blood pressure. No one knows how many genes are
responsible for this common health problem.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">&quot;We had some candidate genes, but none
of them proved to be responsible,&quot; the molecular biologist
says.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">There are an estimated 3,600 diseases
caused by misbehaving genes. They result from errors in a person&#39;s
genetic code, usually a glitch inherited from one or both parents.
It may be as simple as a single dropped or altered gene among the
several billion in the body&#39;s instruction set. The effect may be as
minor as color blindness or as crippling as muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Gene therapy sounds far simpler than
it&#39;s proving to be. The first obstacle is figuring out how to get
the new gene through the cell wall. Scientists are using viruses,
one of nature&#39;s most efficient invaders of cells, to sneak past the
cell wall and insert their own genetic material into the host&#39;s
deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">In human gene therapy, scientists are
using the retrovirus to carry new genes into cells. Once inside,
the new gene must function normally. This depends on locating the
defective gene among the many other thousands in the cell. Genes
inserted in the wrong place won&#39;t work and could cause
out-of-control growth.</p>
<p style="margin-top:0px">Treco&#39;s company, Transkaryotic
Therapies, doesn&#39;t want to use viruses. Instead, it wants to take
the defective cell out of the patient, repair it, make billions of
copies and re-inject them. Officials hope to try this on
hemophiliacs in the next few months.</p>
