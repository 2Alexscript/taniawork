<p>The World Health Organization may announce the official end of the H1N1 pandemic within days.</p>
<p>The virus has killed more than 14,000 people worldwide since April 2009 and prompted a mass vaccination across Canada, where more than 400 people died.</p>
<p>Responding to media reports suggesting WHO might declare the pandemic ended this week, Tim Vail, spokesman for federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, said Sunday there has been a drastic drop in H1N1 cases since its second wave in late 2009.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic is likely to be officially consigned to the history books in the next week or so, says Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Chan suggests the global health agency and the experts that advise it on this matter are feeling increasingly confident the virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic is acquiring the patterns of seasonal flu viruses.</p>
<p>"All in all, people feel that the overall picture looks like we are ready to declare a post-pandemic globally very soon," Chan said in an interview from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The so-called emergency committee is likely to convene a meeting this week, she suggests. The committee is a panel of external and as yet unidentified experts who have advised Chan on major matters related to the pandemic. Chan, who has been harshly criticized for not identifying the members of the committee, has promised to do so once the pandemic is declared over.</p>
<p>The "all clear" could be sounded after that meeting, though outbreaks of H1N1 in schools in parts of New Zealand may delay the decision a little.</p>
<p>"We need to look at the situation. Another week or two? I cannot predict," Chan says.</p>
<p>The call will be made on advice from the emergency committee and with input of the countries currently most affected by H1N1 activity. New Zealand officials will be questioned on how the virus is behaving there. And the committee will likely want to hear from India, which is reporting H1N1 activity recently.</p>
<p>Chan admits she's eager to move to the post-pandemic phase so the agency can focus on analyzing what happened and incorporating the knowledge gained into plans for future pandemics.</p>
<p>While it has claimed at least 18,500 lives globally, the outbreak was far milder than flu experts had been anticipating.</p>

<p>GENDER AND DOMINANT LEG KEY TO KNEE INJURIES</p>
<p>Kicking, pivoting and landing can be important factors in tearing or rupturing the knee's anterior cruciate ligament that helps keep the joint stable. But gender and which leg sustains the injury may be key as well, a study suggests.</p>
<p>Researchers from St. Louis and Santa Monica looked at ACL injuries in dominant versus supporting legs among 93 athletes, 41 male and 52 female. They were a mix of pro, college, high school and youth soccer players who had undergone surgery for a complete ACL tear.</p>
<p>In all athletes, contact and non-contact injuries were evenly distributed between left and right legs.</p>
<p>The vast majority of players (84) preferred kicking with their right leg, while nine kicked with the left. A little more than half of the injuries occurred in the dominant leg.</p>
<p>Even when researchers looked at non-contact ACL injuries only, about half happened on the dominant leg and half on the supporting leg.</p>

<p>Female athletes are at higher risk than males in general for ACL injuries.</p>
<p>The authors speculate that anatomical differences as well as unique neuromuscular patterns during kicking or cutting moves may play a role.</p>

<p>AFTER KILLING 18,500, H1N1 PANDEMIC ENDS</p>
<p>Dr. Margaret Chan, the director general of the World Health Organization, expects the H1N1 flu pandemic to be officially declared over in the next week or so.</p>
<p>There has been very little H1N1 activity in the northern hemisphere since late last year.</p>
<p>But the WHO says the virus has killed at least 18,500 people worldwide since it emerged in the spring of 2009.</p>

<p>For a few weeks last autumn, fear of pandemic influenza stalked the land. Death seemed to lurk around every corner. A sneeze in public could draw a reproachful glance, and every handshake sent the anxious fumbling for their hand sanitizer. Gradually, the panic subsided, to be replaced by confusion over all the fuss made by governments and public-health agencies</p>
<p>But the end of the H1N1 influenza pandemic is now in sight. Fear of H1N1 has now receded to the point that the World Health Organization is expecting to declare the pandemic over in the next week or so.</p>
<p>Dr. Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, said the panel of experts that advises the WHO is feeling increasingly confident H1N1, which has killed more than 18,000 people around the world, has taken on the characteristics of a typical seasonal flu.</p>
<p>“All in all, people feel that the overall picture looks like we are ready to declare post-pandemic globally very soon,” Dr. Chan said.</p>
<p>Every pandemic eventually becomes a seasonal flu strain. This fall, when flu season arrives again, H1N1 will still be one of the major variants floating around, but the population has shown sufficient resistance to it that there have been very few new deaths or flu activity in Canada since February, according to Dr. Perry Kendall, British Columbia's provincial health officer.</p>
<p>As the end approaches for H1N1, many will wonder whether the panic was justified. Immunization programs in Canada had disappointing results, as a little more than 40 per cent of the population was immunized, compared to targets that approached 70 per cent. More than 400 Canadians died as a result of contracting H1N1 and about one in three Canadians were infected.</p>
<p>Dr. Kendall was one of the officials responsible for planning the response. He happened to be in Mexico when the outbreak began there in the spring of 2009, and flew home to high-level meetings to create the public health plan. Though the H1N1 virus was not as deadly as the 1918 Spanish flu, he said, there was no way of knowing that a year ago.</p>
<p>“You can't know in advance what the experience is going to be, particularly in vulnerable populations. That's like having a future-scope. There are some very scary influenza viruses out there,” Dr. Kendall said, citing avian influenza, which kills 60 per cent of the people it infects.</p>
<p>“We were planning with [avian flu] and 1918 in mind, and that meant you had to develop a vaccine as quickly as possible. The lesson learned from this is that unless we get some radical new technologies we're not going to get an influenza vaccine within the first six months. That means for the first wave of the virus, there's going to be no vaccine to protect people.”</p>
<p>It was just as the vaccine was ready to be made available in late October last year that a number of otherwise healthy young people in Ontario died, which sent a wave of fear through the population and brought huge crowds to the first vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>“Statistically it was bound to happen,” Dr. Kendall said, “but when it happens in a large community like Metro Toronto, people get very worried, understandably.”</p>
<p>There was debate about who should be vaccinated first, front-line health care workers or those with health conditions that made them vulnerable. And there was outrage over queue-jumping, particularly allegations professional sports teams received preferential treatment. But by Christmas the fear seemed to have subsided, Dr. Kendall said. At that point there was plenty of vaccine, but no one wanted it. Many felt that too much fear had been generated over a virus that didn't prove anywhere near as deadly as feared.</p>
<p>“We planned for the worst-case scenario,” Dr. Chan said. “If there's something we can do better…I think we would advise people in pandemic preparedness planning in future [that] we should look at the best case scenario, the intermediate case scenario and the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>“That would provide us flexibility to move up and down the scale.”</p>
<p>The pandemic's end will be declared as it takes its second tour of winter in the Southern Hemisphere. So far there has been evidence the intensity of outbreaks has been reduced and the virus is no longer as dominant as it once was.</p>

<p>The print and online tabloids follow actress Tori Spelling's every move, and paparazzi literally wait on the street for her to emerge from her Encino, Calif., home.</p>
<p>That's one price of fame, and Spelling has paid it "since I was 17," she said. She's certainly had her troubles -- most of them sensationalized.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, Spelling, 37, appeared in a string of TV shows produced by her father, the late Aaron Spelling. But it was her 10-year role as Donna Martin in his Beverly Hills 90210 series, and appearances in made-for-TV and independent movies, that established her in the public consciousness.</p>
<p>For the past five years, Spelling and her second husband, actor Dean McDermott, have produced and starred in their own reality show on the Oxygen Network, Tori & Dean: Home Sweet Hollywood. They have two young children, Liam and Stella.</p>
<p>Spelling's two autobiographies, sTori Telling (2008) and Mommywood (2009), were best-sellers. Though her trademark wit is again front and center in her new book, uncharted terriTORI (Gallery, $25, 224 pages), she confronts some serious issues as well.</p>
<p>I caught up recently with Spelling as she waited in the Dallas Fort Worth International Airport for a connecting flight to Tampa, Fla., where her book tour was to continue.</p>
<p>Q. What about the new book?</p>
<p>A. This one gets a lot deeper than the others. I started out thinking it would be my funny stories and anecdotes, but it took a different turn.</p>
<p>Q. There's an anecdote in it about you contacting the late Farrah Fawcett.</p>
<p>A. It was during a reading on the phone with (celebrity psychic) John Edward. We have the same publicist. I thought, "Oh, this'll be cool, maybe my dad will come through." Instead, John said, "Farrah Fawcett's coming through." He was really surprised, too. She wanted me to let her family know she's happy and OK. I wrote a letter to Ryan O'Neal, explaining the story. I said, "Please don't think I'm crazy, I'm simply passing on a message."</p>
<p>Q. Your dramatic weight loss last year was rumoured to have been an eating disorder, but you say it was the swine flu.</p>
<p>A. It was. I've definitely recovered from the flu part, but the complications from it led to a breakdown of my immune system, which is slowly starting to rebuild. My stomach is still kind of a mess.</p>
<p>Q. You opened a Twitter account for your three-year-old son, Liam.</p>
<p>A. I did. So far he has 25,000 followers.</p>
<p>Q. Has your husband, Dean, recovered from his most recent motorcycle accident?</p>
<p>A. He's out of the hospital and home, at least, but he's still in so much pain he can barely walk or lift the kids.</p>
<p>Q. You were estranged from your mother, Candy, and have publicly feuded with her, but you spent Mother's Day with her.</p>
<p>A. Our relationship is really good now. It was a conscious choice on both our parts to leave the past in the past and not dwell on figuring out what went wrong. We realize that today's a new day.</p>
<p>Q. You literally grew up on TV. Did you watch many of your dad's shows, like The Love Boat and Fantasy Island?</p>
<p>A. Oh, my God, yes -- religiously. And it wasn't just because I had to, it was because they were amazing shows.</p>
<p>On weekends, he'd sit there with scripts and rewrite page after page of every show he had. He would always ask me,"What do you think of this character?" I would always be his little casting assistant. He was so detail-oriented, I think that's where I get my type-A personality.</p>
<p>Q. What do you watch now?</p>
<p>A. A lot of reality TV. Right now we're big into the Food Network because it has adult shows the kids will watch with us. It's a lot better for them than cartoons.</p>
<p>Q. Your life has long been an open book.</p>
<p>A. It's really hard to get privacy. When we're at home, that's our private moment. If there's an element missing (from my life), it's probably "me." In the process of taking care of my family and building our businesses, I've lost a little bit of "me" time. I would love to have more "me" back in there so I can enjoy my family and our successes. Frankly, I don't always have enough time to do that. I'm working on it.</p>

<p>That roar you hear on downtown Niagara-on-the-Lake streets might be actor Kyle Blair on his new motorbike. "It was a little treat I gave to myself," said the 31-year-old University of Windsor graduate.</p>
<p>Blair is in a pair of shows this season at the Shaw Festival -- One Touch of Venus at the Royal George Theatre, and the just-opened Serious Money at the Studio.</p>
<p>"My mom thought I was crazy buying a motorcycle until I gave her a ride on it the other day."</p>
<p>"She still doesn't think much of it, but she had fun."</p>
<p>Blair spent eight seasons at the Stratford Festival of Canada before moving to the Shaw this season, joining fellow Windsor graduate Claire Jullien and others in making the shift between the rival theatre companies.</p>
<p>So far, he hasn't had anything to complain about. "It's a wonderful acting community here," he said.</p>
<p>There's even a new Balzac's ice cream parlour in town -- Stratford's Balzac's was a favourite of Blair's and many other actors.</p>
<p>One Touch of Venus, with a score by Kurt Weill and lyrics by Ogden Nash, is one of the Shaw's popular "pocket" musicals -- a full-fledged production shrunk to the confines of the intimate 328-seat Royal George Theatre, a former vaudeville house.</p>
<p>Blair plays bachelor Rodney, who happens to place a ring on the finger of a statue of Venus and causes it to come to life. The living statue, played by Robin Evan Willis, is immediately infatuated with Rodney, which leads to all sorts of complications with his fiancee, Gloria, played by Julie Martell.</p>
<p>One Touch of Venus continues until Oct. 10.</p>
<p>Blair's other show is Caryl Churchill's Serious Money, a penetrating but humorous look at corporate greed among stock raiders in London in the 1980s. It is currently in previews and scheduled to open Aug. 14 at the 200-seat Studio Theatre. It continues through Sept. 12.</p>
<p>THE DOCTOR AND THE BULL</p>
<p>Early July saw the openings of two plays by George Bernard Shaw, The Doctor's Dilemma at the Festival Theatre and John Bull's Other Island at the Court House.</p>
<p>Morris Panych directed The Doctor's Dilemma, in which a doctor faces a moral dilemma over whom to offer his miracle cure -- the sickly patient to whom he previously promised the cure, or the husband of a young woman with whom he becomes infatuated.</p>
<p>He decides on the artist, hoping the cure doesn't work and he can move in to take his place at the woman's side.</p>
<p>"It's a timely piece," said Shaw's Colleen Blake, "particularly when you think of the H1N1 virus and how hockey players were getting the vaccine before other people. Deciding who goes first is a medical dilemma that reaches across the decades from Shaw's time."</p>
<p>The rarely performed John Bull's Other Island is about a rascally British land developer, played by Benedict Campbell, who sets his sights on the sleepy Irish hometown of his business partner, Larry Doyle, played by Graeme Somerville.</p>
<p>Doyle goes along with the scheme because he wants to shake the dust of his Irish roots off his boots.</p>
<p>The production was directed by former Shaw artistic director Christopher Newton. The character of Doyle can be seen as a thinly disguised version of the playwright Shaw, an Irishman who also made his name in England.</p>
<p>But it's the charm of the ancillary characters, including Jim Mezon's delightfully philosophical Keegan, that prop up this otherwise wordy play.</p>
<p>The Doctor's Dilemma continues through Oct. 30, while John Bull's Other Island runs through Oct. 9.</p>
<p>HALF AN HOUR</p>
<p>The play's the thing, and it's barely 30 minutes long.</p>
<p>The Shaw's Lunchtime Theatre attraction is J.M. Barrie's one-act play, Half An Hour, directed by Gina Wilkinson.</p>
<p>Diana Donnelly plays socialite Lilian Garson, a woman who laments her loveless marriage to an abusive aristocrat. Instead of dreaming how different her life might have been had she taken another turn, she takes fate into her own hands in the half-hour before her dinner guests are scheduled to arrive.</p>
<p>Barrie, who is best-known as the author of Peter Pan, made a good living writing these one-act dramas. The piece reveals itself like a Rubic's Cube of succinct language and high drama.</p>
<p>Theatre-light it may be, but you won't be disappointed. Think of Half An Hour as an appetizer before lunch and a matinee performance at another theatre.</p>
<p>Half An Hour continues through Oct. 9.</p>

<p>Mid-season at the Shaw Festival in Niagara-on-the-Lake is anything but high season.</p>
<p>July and August, in fact, are the toughest months to get people to attend the theatre festival, said executive director Colleen Blake. The summer months can make or break the festival, but the management is not in desperation mode.</p>
<p>The spring was the festival's strongest in many seasons, and there's an ace-in-the-hole -- Harvey at the Royal George Theatre.</p>
<p>"We had a great April, May and June," Blake said.</p>
<p>Blake, a University of Windsor English literature grad, has been running the business affairs at Shaw since 1994.</p>
<p>Every year about this time she and artistic director Jackie Maxwell, along with directors and actors, sit down and thrash out plans for the following season.</p>
<p>It's a balancing act to find titles that will appeal to the public while trying to stick to the festival's mandate of offering drama primarily from the late-Victorian and Edwardian periods.</p>
<p>Most of the big-ticket attractions at the 869-seat Festival Theatre are classics from those periods. This year, the fare in the Festival Theatre includes Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband, Clair Booth Luce's The Women, and the recently added The Doctor's Dilemma by the festival's namesake, George Bernard Shaw.</p>
<p>The Doctor's Dilemma, which opened July 9 and continues through Oct. 30, was timed to add a booster thrust to attendance during the sagging summer months.</p>
<p>So far, so good, Blake reported. The critics have been kind, and audiences are responding well.</p>
<p>But the trick is to provide audience-pleasing titles in the smaller theatres -- the 327-seat Court House, the 328-seat Royal George, and the 200-seat Studio.</p>
<p>"You just never know about the plays," Blake said.</p>
<p>And unforeseen factors can wreak havoc with the best-laid plans. Last year, the combination of the H1N1 virus scare and the downturn in the economy hit the Shaw hard.</p>
<p>"We felt the recession quite dramatically last year," Blake said. Ticket sales were down at all theatres -- while total attendance in good years can rise to 300,000, 2009's attendance was 253,000. Attendance in 2009 was 63.5 per cent of capacity, a drop of 6.5 per cent from 2008.</p>
<p>"It was really tough. But I have to say our first three months this year have been great for us."</p>
<p>This season began with dark clouds of labour unrest before the curtains rose. The festival locked out its maintenance workers in early March, threatening to stall the rehearsal process. But an agreement was reached mere days later.</p>
<p>The biggest boost to this season's fare so far has come from the festival's left-field hit, Harvey, at the Royal George. It has been charming and selling out houses since it opened in April.</p>
<p>Mary Chase's Pulitzer Prize-winning play about a middle-aged bachelor who has an invisible companion -- a six-foot rabbit named Harvey -- has taken the festival by storm. Blake and her colleagues probably had a notion it was hit material because they scheduled it as the very first show out of the blocks when previews began April 1.</p>
<p>Recently, it was announced there will be added performances to meet demand. "It has been the runaway hit of the season," Blake said.</p>
<p>Harvey is a hedge against weaker performers on the schedule. It has also bucked a trend in recent years in that audiences are booking tickets well in advance. "Generally, people have been holding on to their entertainment dollars until the last minute," Blake said. "We're not the only ones experiencing that. It's happening at the Stratford Festival, too."</p>
<p>It's a trend that makes her work all the more frustrating.</p>
<p>"It is almost impossible to predict what ticket sales will be like the rest of the way," she said.</p>

<p>Mexico's Mexicana de Aviacion, one of the world's oldest airlines, has suspended ticket sales as it negotiates pay cuts with pilots and flight attendants to avert looming bankruptcy, the company said Thursday. The airline, which was founded in 1921, sought protection from Mexican and U.S. creditors this week after finding itself unprofitable because of a worldwide crisis in the aviation sector last year, compounded by the swine flu epidemic that depressed tourism to Mexico. According to the airline, it has $786 million US in debts, and $865 million in revenues.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>We're pigging out on bacon, at any price; High pork costs don't deter Canadians now that BLT season is here</b>
</div><div>Dana Flavelle  Toronto Star   </div>

</p>
<p>The cost of putting pork on your fork might be soaring but Canadians aren't giving up bacon, especially homemade bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches during the peak tomato harvest season.</p>
<p>Ignoring warnings about salt and fat, we will eat 50 per cent more BLTs at home this year than in 2005, according to <span class="companylink">The NPD Group Inc</span>., a market research firm.</p>
<p>We're also eating more bacon in fast food restaurants, where it's a popular topping on burgers and in breakfast buns, the market research firm's data show.</p>
<p>About 17 per cent of all burgers are bacon cheeseburgers for a total of 118 million bacon-loaded burgers sold annually in Canada, said Linda Strachan, the firm's director of food service.</p>
<p>"It delivers taste, and a few pennies difference in the topping on their favourite burger or sandwich isn't likely to sway them," she said.</p>
<p>Bacon may be seen as a cheap indulgence compared to other meats, part of the "trading down" phenomenon that began during the recession, said Joel Gregoire, food and beverage analyst at NPD Group. The introduction of low sodium varieties may also be helping spur sales, though they still make up a relatively low portion of retail sales, he added.</p>
<p>Prices for bacon usually climb in August when tomatoes are ready for harvest and more people eat bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches. And hot, dry weather means 2010 is a bumper tomato crop.</p>
<p>"Typically sales of bacon are highest at this time of year, not just in BLTs but in everything else," says Keith Robbins, a spokesperson for the Ontario Pork Producers. "Bacon's a good flavour enhancer. It's used on everything from bacon burgers to Caesar salads. Seasonally you're travelling more, grabbing more stuff on the road. There's a number of those types of things that come into market."</p>
<p>The wholesale price of pork bellies, used to make bacon, is up 72 per cent over this time last year on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, which sets the price for North America.</p>
<p>At $1.43 a pound (U.S.), that's the highest level since at least 1998 as hog producers on both sides of the border flee what has been a money-losing business. However, it's unclear who's swallowing the higher wholesale fees.</p>
<p>Intense competition among restaurant chains and retailers in Canada means they have limited ability to pass on price increases.</p>
<p>The price of a 500 mg package of bacon in the supermarket hit a high of $5.13 in 2004, according to the Consumer Price Index, but was just $4.71 in June of this year. In the States, retail prices averaged $4 a pound in June, the highest since at least 1980.</p>
<p>As well, North American hog producers continue to struggle despite the price increase. At $155 per hog in Ontario, up from $110 last summer, producers are just now breaking even, Robbins said.</p>
<p>Wholesale prices are likely to head higher as record numbers of hog producers continue to leave the industry.</p>
<p>In Ontario, market hogs are down by 12 per cent while breeding sows are down by 20 per cent compared to this time last year, the pork producers association said.</p>
<p>Between the erroneously dubbed "swine flu," renamed H1N1, and ethanol demand driving up the price of corn, a primary feed for hogs, the industry has taken a beating.</p>

</p>
<p>The August harvest of field tomatoes is giving the lowly pork belly a lift.</p>
<p>As North Americans tuck into their popular bacon, lettuce and tomato sandwiches, the price of pork bellies, sliced to make bacon, has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>The rise is welcome news for pork farmers, who have endured two years of soaring feed costs, and a swine flu outbreak that reduced sales and lowered prices.</p>
<p>Now, the B in BLT is getting a lift from the T.</p>
<p>On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, frozen pork bellies now trade around $1.14 (U.S.) a pound, a 42-per-cent increase since last August. Whole hog prices have gone up by 7.5 per cent in the past month.</p>
<p>Canadian producers benefit from this surging U.S. pork market because most of Canada's hogs are exported and priced in Chicago.</p>
<p>Of course, a love of sandwiches made with fresh tomatoes and bacon isn't the only reason pork prices have risen. A tight supply is the biggest culprit. As far back as two winters ago, producers starting cutting their herds amid low prices.</p>
<p>At the time, it cost about $120 (Canadian) to feed 100 kilograms, but the animal sold for only $82, said Larry Martin an agricultural economist with the George Morris Centre in Guelph, Ont. A few months later, swine flu hit and most Asian companies stopped importing North American pork.</p>
<p>“It was just absolutely devastating. A lot of people went out of business, especially in Canada,” Mr. Martin said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms Inc</span>., where Mr. Martin was chairman of the board, survived, but the company cut its own supply by about 20 per cent, the average hit taken by Canadian pork producers.</p>
<p>The environment today is much healthier. “Now you've got lower supplies, export markets have opened up again to some extent, and people aren't scared about pork any more,” Mr. Martin said.</p>
<p>And then there's bacon demand, propped up by both ripe American Midwest tomatoes ready for BLT sandwiches and a fast food industry that has added bacon slices to many new offerings, particularly breakfast sandwiches, said Altin Kalo, commodity analyst with Steiner Consulting Group in New Hampshire.</p>
<p>He also noted that a year ago pork belly prices were much cheaper, so producers added to their hog inventory very slowly. Moreover, because it takes, on average, 3 months, 3 weeks, and 3 days, to breed new pigs, “we're probably looking at another 9 months of tight supply,” Mr. Martin said. “You can't just go out and push a button and increase supply.”</p>
<p>Sustained higher prices would certainly help Canadian pork producers, he added, but that doesn't mean there aren't problems on the horizon.</p>
<p>First, because futures are priced in U.S. dollars, producers north of the border are hurt by a rising Canadian dollar. Second, a growing global demand for food and poor weather has bumped feed prices (wheat, corn, and soybeans), and producers will feel the pain if demand falls.</p>
<p>These costs are the big issue right now because margins aren't enormous, Mr. Martin said. “Hog producers aren't making huge amounts of money right now.”</p>

<p>In a small, windowless room in the basement of <span class="companylink">International Business Machines Corp</span>.'s Almaden lab in Silicon Valley, Dharmendra Modha is building a simulated monkey brain using images projected on flat-screen TVs.</p>
<p>Modha, the lab's manager of cognitive computing, urged "Big Blue" to back his pet project, which combines advances in nanotechnology, supercomputing and neuroscience. If successful, the effort could help computers "think' like the human mind.</p>
<p>IBM green lights proposals from Modha and other researchers at the San Jose, California, facility because some of the gambles can spawn significant business. Since the 1990s, lab advances in how data is stored, managed and analyzed have helped generate millions of dollars in sales. Yet even lab directors concede chances are slim that any one breakthrough will make a sizable addition to IBM's almost $100 billion in annual revenue.</p>
<p>"We have no way of making money off of this unless a miracle happens and we figure out how to make better computers," said Laura Haas, director of computer science at Almaden and the lab's second-in-command, who wears a "Question Authority" button.</p>
<p>"We're different. It takes a different kind of craziness here."</p>
<p>While IBM may move at a slower pace than smaller West Coast startups, it aims to give Almaden researchers as much leeway as their Silicon Valley peers, said Winfried Wilcke, senior manager of the lab's nanoscale science and technology research.</p>
<p>"If you think of us as dinosaurs, then think of us as velociraptors," he said, referring to the nimble predators of the Late Cretaceous period. "The freedom we have here is great."</p>
<p>Silicon Valley labs have a mixed record of getting a high return on investment from their discoveries. While IBM was able to capitalize on Almaden's invention of the disk drive and relational database, many of <span class="companylink">Xerox Corp</span>.'s early innovations at its Palo Alto Research Center -- such as the Macintosh-style graphical user interface -- brought more benefit to other companies.</p>
<p>"Making some bets that are unlinked to specific outcomes is important, but if it's all kind of curiosity-driven research, the ROI on innovation investing may not be that high," said John Kao, chairman of the Institute for Large Scale Innovation in San Francisco.</p>
<p>Some investors say IBM needs big deals more than research to increase revenue. While the company has boosted earnings per share through such steps as buybacks and cost controls, rivals <span class="companylink">Oracle Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hewlett-Packard Co</span>. have eclipsed its stock performance in part through purchases that added to sales.</p>
<p>Since Sam Palmisano became chief executive officer of IBM in 2002, it has spent $25 billion buying publicly held companies, including about $4.5 billion to buy Cognos in Ottawa. Compare that with at least $45 billion for HP and $42 billion for <span class="companylink">Oracle</span>.</p>
<p>On Palmisano's watch, IBM also has increased its research spending by 31 per cent. Last year, it devoted $5.8 billion, about six per cent of annual revenue, to R&D.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley version of IBM fosters a freer attitude and more of a startup mentality than headquarters in Armonk, New York. While the century-old IBM is known for white shirts, dark suits and button-downed attitude, the staff at Almaden tackles oddball research projects and unwinds by holding sack races and tug-of-war competitions.</p>
<p>Located on a hill in a 1,600-acre wildlife preserve, the Almaden lab is painted a custom dark-green colour derived from leaves and grass that employees gathered on site. The lobby boasts a two-metre-diameter digital display globe that was purchased after researchers saw a similar device at a Denver museum and thought it would be "cool" to have one.</p>
<p>"New York was like, 'You crazy scientists can do this, but come August, you have show us results,' " said Julia Grace, a social and collaborative computing engineer. The globe has been used to plot last year's swine flu outbreak and more recently to show the location of people sending messages delivered via Twitter during World Cup soccer matches.</p>
<p>Almaden's projects include an electric battery for cars that could run 800 kilometres on one charge, a desalination system and a program that shows changes in geographical data. Researchers can shake up an industry, even if they don't make a fortune, Haas said.</p>
<p>"You're not going to get rich, but you can change the world," she said. "IBM is a big ship, and you need a certain amount of patience to turn the wheel. But if that ship turns, the wake in the industry is enormous."</p>
<p>Employees at the lab consider themselves "wild ducks" for working on projects that don't fit in with what headquarters in New York wants to pursue, she said.</p>
<p>Almaden has a "better sense of the next big thing" because of its location, said Mark Dean, IBM's vice-president of strategy, who works at the Watson lab in Yorktown Heights, New York.</p>
<p>"It's the only place in IBM where we're doing advanced battery research," he said. "The only place we're doing water desalination."</p>
<p>Even with its renegade spirit, Almaden is under growing pressure to produce results, said David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
<p>"People expect more product impact from their research labs than they did 20 to 30 years ago," he said.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Almaden developed a method of encryption for media content. Used in memory cards and Blu-ray discs, it has earned IBM millions of dollars in licensing fees.</p>
<p>Giant magnetoresistive heads, introduced in 1997, helped hard disk drives increase their data-storage capacity 40-fold. A query system developed at Almaden in the late 1990s, named Garlic, integrates data from multiple sources and has earned IBM hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. More recently, the lab developed a file-management system called GPFS that IBM now adds to its archiving, networking and cloud computing products.</p>
<p>Some projects don't pan out. In the early 1990s, Haas and IBM's database management team wanted to figure out a way of searching the web, something that didn't click.</p>
<p>"If we did it right, we might have invented search before <span class="companylink">Google</span>," Haas said. "But we had the wrong model, and we totally missed the boat. We were thinking about librarians."</p>
<p>Modha, the researcher working on the monkey brain, quit IBM a decade ago in order to work on his own startup. After a short time, he realized he didn't have the financial acumen to run a business and returned to Almaden.</p>
<p>"We have a 100-year history," he said. "The challenge is, how do we usher in the next 100 years?"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fear dangerous in health care</b>
</div><div>Elizabeth Payne   </div>
<div>Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>995 words</div><div>3 August 2010</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Franklin Delano Roosevelt was not talking about CT scans, fetal monitors, mammograms and cesarean sections when he uttered the words, "The only thing we have to fear is fear itself," but he could have been.</p>
<p>With the possible exception of security, there is no area in which fear plays a greater role in shaping policy and practice than health care. Sometimes that is a good thing and saves lives, as the H1N1 vaccine did in Ontario last year.</p>
<p>All too often, though, that is not the case. Fear can be a dangerous, even deadly, policy tool. In some cases, society's intolerance to risk in health care is making people sicker. One of the most insidious examples of how fear can lead to policies and practices that, instead of making people safer puts them at greater risk, is birth.</p>
<p>I attended a conference recently in which Eugene De-clercq, from Boston University's School of Public Health, presented evidence that skyrocketing caesarean rates in the U.S. are making birth more dangerous for mothers and babies, leading to increased health problems, even deaths. The research should resonate in Canada and other countries where C-section rates have also increased sharply.</p>
<p>Declercq is not philosophically opposed to C-sections. They are crucial, he says -- mothers and babies die in countries where they are not readily available. "Cesarean sections are not inherently good or bad," he said. "But there is a balance that needs to be struck."</p>
<p>In poor countries where mothers have no access to life-saving cesarean sections, that imbalance can spell death. It is a significant reason why more than 300,000 mothers around the world die in childbirth every year.</p>
<p>But when the balance tips too far the other way -- when there are too many C-sections being performed without good reason -- mothers and babies also face increased risk of death or injury.</p>
<p>According to Declercq's research, when C-sections are performed in low-risk, uncomplicated births, the neonatal death rate is 58 per cent higher than it is for vaginal births. In addition, some of those mothers are more than twice as likely to be rehospitalized in the first 30 days after birth.</p>
<p>In an age in which some doctors and patients believe C-sections should be available on demand, those are sobering figures. Like any medicine, C-sections should be taken in moderation, but our intolerance for risk has created a culture in which they are almost the norm, in some cases.</p>
<p>Other research has concluded that the best outcomes for mothers and babies is when cesarean-section rates remain below 15 per cent. Rates above that seem to do more harm than good. But in the U.S., nearly one-in-three babies is delivered by C-section. Canada's C-section rates have steadily climbed in recent years into the upper 20s.</p>
<p>Despite the evidence that unnecessary C-sections expose mothers and babies to risk, record rates continue. And what is driving that change in practice when it comes to birth?</p>
<p>To a large extent, it is fear, by the medical profession, and by parents, which leads to more testing and monitoring, a greater tendency to induce labour for fear that the baby will be too large or is overdue, and less tolerance for letting birth progress, all of which leads to more doctors advising more patients that a C-section is the only safe option. In many cases, they are right, but in increasing numbers of births in which there no complications, they are seriously wrong.</p>
<p>Birth is just one example of how fear drives policies that do little to improve health -- and may cause harm.</p>
<p>In the U.S., which spends more per person on health care than any country in the world, there are growing concerns that overtesting is creating more problems than it is solving.</p>
<p>Americans who can afford good health care get screened, tested and monitored at a rate largely unheard of in the rest of the world. We in Canada are often put to shame with comparisons about how quickly an American patient can get access to an MRI or CT scan, for example.</p>
<p>It turns out that all those tests and screens are not making our American neighbours healthier. In some cases, they are contributing to making them sicker. Researchers weighing the risks and benefits of high-tech testing and screening are increasingly concluding that the risks outweigh the benefits, that expanding routine cancer screening does not save more lives and may lead to unnecessary and invasive procedures, not to mention exposing patients to unnecessary radiation.</p>
<p>Groups concerned about the danger of the trend, including the American Cancer Society and others, have recently recommended fewer tests for breast cancer, prostate cancer and heart disease.</p>
<p>The health care system will first have to convince the public that less is more when it comes to testing and screening. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2004 found that the American public was so enthusiastic about screening, that 73 per cent of those surveyed said they would prefer to receive a "total-body computed tomographic scan" over $1,000 in cash. This enthusiasm, researchers noted, creates an environment ripe for premature testing, "placing the public at risk of overtesting and overtreatment.</p>
<p>Those enthusiastic patients are likely to find a medical establishment in which, despite mounting evidence that it is often the wrong way to go, the mantra that more is better continues to win the day.</p>
<p>In this way, fear leads to extreme risk aversion, which leads to a culture of overtesting, overtreatment and intervention that puts patients at increased risk. It's an unhealthy cycle. And it's time both patients and professionals stepped off.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>ERs get funding to cut wait times</b>
</div><div>By Johanna Weidner   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>1234 words</div><div>30 July 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Three local hospitals will share about $2.4 million in provincial funding to reduce emergency room wait times as part of a $100-million pay-for-results program.</p>
<p>This is the third year Grand River Hospital has received funding to lower ER waits, the second for St. Mary's Hospital and the first for Cambridge Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p>St. Mary's was one of just seven hospitals in Ontario awarded a performance bonus last year for exceeding expectations, with Health Minister Deb Matthews visiting the hospital in May to praise its accomplishment of cutting wait times by 23 per cent, or one hour and 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Currently, local emergency rooms vary compared to the provincial average in their ER wait times for treating complex and minor conditions. Cambridge Memorial beat the average in both categories, while Grand River had longer waits for both. St. Mary's had a shorter than average wait for complex patients and above average for minor conditions.</p>
<p>The provincial target is eight hours for complex conditions requiring more time for diagnosis, treatment or hospital bed admission, and four hours for minor or uncomplicated conditions. (The amount of time a patient spends in the emergency room is measured from when a patient registers or sees a triage nurse, until the time they leave the ER, whether going home after being treated or being admitted to a hospital bed.)</p>
<p>Current provincial wait times as of June are 11 hours for complex conditions and 4.3 hours for minor conditions.</p>
<p>Here are the wait times for the region's hospitals in treating complex and minor cases:</p>
<p>Grand River: 12.1; 7.5</p>
<p>St. Mary's: 9.1; 5.2</p>
<p>Cambridge: 9.8; 3.9</p>
<p>St. Mary's success last year came from looking at patient flow in the emergency room and beyond to in-patient units, said Sandra Hett, chief nursing executive at the Kitchener hospital.</p>
<p>"We didn't look at the emergency department in isolation," Hett said.</p>
<p>Staff mapped out everything done for a patient from the emergency department to a hospital bed, how long each step took and determined if it's necessary. This year they'll expand that approach to other in-patient units.</p>
<p>A month ago, the hospital hired a nurse practitioner to work on the weekend. Before, only weekdays were covered, and already they're seeing a benefit in lowered wait times on the weekends.</p>
<p>Adding nurse practitioners, who can assess minor ailments, to emergency departments is a strategy all local hospitals have adopted to reduce the backlog. Grand River is adding a fourth nurse practitioner this fall with their funding.</p>
<p>At Cambridge Memorial, most of the money will go to staff positions, including a second nurse practitioner in the ER and other staff equivalents, to just under nine full-time equivalents to improve patient flow.</p>
<p>The hospital is thrilled to be part of the program and has consulted with other hospitals for ways to improve, said Susan Gregoroff, vice-president of clinical programs and chief nursing executive.</p>
<p>"It's really about learning from each other," Gregoroff said.</p>
<p>Although the Cambridge hospital is doing well with relatively low wait times, she said, they're keen to do even better and will monitor their progress with the new initiatives to make adjustments if needed.</p>
<p>Along with another nurse practitioner, Grand River added four mental health beds to their emergency department while waiting for a much-needed expansion of their mental health unit.</p>
<p>The hospital is doing better with ER waits, spokesperson Mark Karjaluoto said, but the times do vary, depending on the demand during a given season, such as during the recent H1N1 outbreak when the hospital was deluged with patients.</p>
<p>Grand River is rethinking its initiatives from the program's first two years and has developed a more focused plan for this year, said Stewart Sutley, senior director of performance and accountability with the Waterloo Wellington Local Health Integration Network.</p>
<p>"They have struggled," he said. "They are the busiest, biggest hospital in our area."</p>
<p>Since 2008, the province reports, the pay-for-results program helped participating hospitals lower overall wait times by 4.7 hours for patients requiring complex medical care or admission to hospital, and by 1.4 hours for patients with minor complaints.</p>
<p>The average improvement for all reporting ERs was more modest - three hours for complex patients and half an hour for minor issues.</p>
<p>Funding for local hospitals this year includes $935,400 for Grand River, $764,500 for St. Mary's and $782,100 for Cambridge Memorial.</p>
<p>About $60 million will be spent on projects aimed at decreasing wait times, such as adding and reorganizing staff and renovating ERs to improve patient flow. The remaining $40 million is an incentive fund to reward hospitals that improve their wait times.</p>
<p>"So now it's a race," said Sutley.</p>
<p>The initiative pushes hospitals to recognize there's a ceiling on provincial funding, he said, and "they have to do what they're doing better."</p>
<p>That goes far beyond just streamlining the ER.</p>
<p>"This may start in the emergency department, but this is really about reforming the hospital from end to end," Sutley said.</p>
<p>Ontario has 163 emergency rooms, with 2.8 million people making 5.25 million visits every year.</p>
<p>Only 71 - less than half - are now included in the pay-for-results program.</p>
<p>Opposition critics said the money would be better spent creating more long-term care beds to free up space in clogged hospitals.</p>
<p>"This is putting the resources in the wrong place," NDP health critic France Gelinas said.</p>
<p>Emergency departments are busy because residents don't have access to family doctors and many frail, elderly people aren't getting what they need from home care, she said.</p>
<p>"They get into trouble, they end up in emergency and then the ball starts rolling again."</p>
<p>The government must make a real investment in nursing homes if they want to ease the congestion in hospitals, Progressive Conservative MPP Lisa MacLeod said.</p>
<p>MacLeod is not impressed that the government thinks waiting 10 hours or less in an ER is a success. She says anyone who's visited an ER in the province knows that more needs to be done to reduce the wait.</p>
<p>MacLeod says the government should invest in nursing homes to free up space in hospitals for patients who need urgent care.</p>
<p>Kitchener mother Michelle Omar was in Grand River's emergency department on Thursday afternoon with her 13-year-old son Daniel.</p>
<p>She was impressed her son, who recently suffered a large gash on his arm and needed attention for a possible infection, was seen by a nurse practitioner and then a doctor within an hour.</p>
<p>"I was really surprised," Omar said.</p>
<p>As a mother of four, she's happy to know it's possible to come into the emergency department with one of her children and not wait half a day to be seen. When it's not possible to get into see their family doctor, there are few options.</p>
<p>Until recently, she avoided the ER because of past long waits.</p>
<p>"I'd be more likely to come in again."</p>

<div>SERIOUSLY / BY DR. ANNA TADDIO</div>
<div>Globe Life</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Does coughing soften the prick of a needle?</b>
</div><div>SERIOUSLY?   </div>
<div>578 words</div><div>27 July 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L4</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>We ask the experts to settle common questions we've all wondered about.</p>
<p>QUESTION</p>
<p>Is there any truth to the notion that coughing while getting a needle helps ease the pain?</p>
<p>ANSWER</p>
<p>Some researchers have tested whether coughing during medical procedures can ease the pain. So far, the results are not compelling. Some research suggests it may act as a distraction, taking attention away from the needle or other procedure. We know that if people are distracted, they tend to feel less pain. For others, it may not work because it is a cue that the procedure is about to happen, heightening fear and making the pain worse.</p>
<p>The bigger issue here is the under-treatment of pain. Our society has always accepted needle pain as a part of ‘good health care,' but the truth is, it doesn't need to be. In fact, in the long term it may be dangerous for us not to address needle pain, right from the time of birth. New research tells us that untreated pain can leave a permanent neural imprint or pain memory. Pain memory changes future pain sensations and may also lead to fears of the needle and the doctor. The most common question a child asks when entering a doctor's office is “Am I getting a shot today?” The reason for this is simple: Needles hurt, and that's what children remember! And they remember for a lifetime.</p>
<p>It is estimated that up to one in four people have a fear of needles. The consequences are that they may avoid the health-care system because a needle might be part of their care. Think of the missed opportunities for preventive health measures, such as avoidance of doctor's or dentist's appointments, and missed immunizations. We learned from H1N1 how important it is for society to be prepared to be vaccinated; yet less than 40 per cent of people chose to get the vaccine. Pain typically prevents at least five to 10 per cent of people from getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>The good news is there are many proven ways to minimize pain, and parents and health professionals can easily implement them. Pain management uses a “three P” approach: physical, psychological, and pharmacological strategies. Physical strategies include things like sitting up during procedures (instead of lying down), and rubbing or applying pressure near the site before and during the needle poke. Psychological strategies include deep breathing (for children, this can be done by blowing bubbles or a pinwheel), and distraction (listening to music or watching a video or playing with toys). Pharmacological strategies include using topical anesthetic (numbing) medicines and sugar water for infants. Breastfeeding is considered an effective combination intervention. Fortunately, these treatments are relatively easy for anyone to use. Combining a few of them can also improve pain relief.</p>
<p>Yet a change in the medical community's attitude about pain is urgently needed. This includes acknowledging pain as a side effect of needles that requires treatment, as well as recognizing the value of pain relief as an important aspect of quality (and humane) medical care. We don't need to choose between pain relief and good health care; pain relief is part of good health care.</p>

<p>Wrong</p>
<p>Why Experts Keep Failing Us -- And How to Know When Not to Trust Them</p>
<p>By David H. Freedman</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Little, Brown and Co</span>., 295 pages, $32</p>
<p>If you have ever been exasperated by conflicting expert opinion on swine flu, the latest miracle drug or global warming (or is it "climate change"?), Wrong is the right book is for you.</p>
<p>David H. Freedman, an American science and business journalist, has written a useful and entertaining (when it is not disturbing) guide to the reasons experts are mostly wrong and how we can learn to recognize advice that is likely to be right.</p>
<p>Freedman broadly defines "experts" as people usually quoted by the mass media as credible authorities, including pop gurus, celebrities and scientists.</p>
<p>Medical research is heavily dependent on animal trials and mice in particular. Many readers will be surprised by Freedman's contention that very few mice studies are, in practical terms, applicable to humans.</p>
<p>Initial media excitement about medical breakthroughs based on mice trials rarely result in successful human treatments.</p>
<p>This is even more marked in psychiatric drug trials. Freedman quotes a Massachusetts Institute of Technology brain scientist saying, "When it comes to emotion and cognition, things are manifestly different in humans than in mice."</p>
<p>When you come to think of it, that sounds like expert advice likely to be right.</p>
<p>Researchers are not supposed to favour particular outcomes in their studies, but Freedman suggests that vanity, vested interest or careerism tempt many to twist the data to produce the results they want.</p>
<p>Part of the problem lies with the general public. We don't like grappling with complex issues. We like our advice to be simple.</p>
<p>We particularly like advice that promises solutions without effort and we handsomely reward gurus who purport to tell us how to lose weight, make money and gain lifelong happiness without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>A key factor in questionable research is that experts are often paid to get it wrong. Salaries, grants and careers often depend on producing results favorable to drug manufacturers.</p>
<p>Sometimes, companies even try to disguise their connection to certain findings by paying university researchers to put their names to studies actually written by the companies themselves.</p>
<p>Freedman maintains that researchers who question the integrity of their colleagues pay a high price. Strangely, he illustrates this by the case of MIT AIDS researcher Thereza Imanishi-Kari.</p>
<p>An assistant claimed her research had been falsified. The MIT establishment closed ranks around Imanshi-Kari and the whistleblower lost her job.</p>
<p>In fact, after 10 years, an independent appeal panel found there was no falsification and vindicated Imanishi-Kari.</p>
<p>A better example might have been that of Nancy Olivieri from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto who endured years of intimidation by a drug company after revealing serious flaws in one of its products.</p>
<p>It is hard to avoid noting that Freedman supports his argument with favourable quotes from more than 30 experts from institutions including McMaster University, the London School of Economics and Yale, Berkeley and Oxford universities who agree with him. That seems a poor way to make the point that experts are usually wrong.</p>
<p>However, disarmingly, Freedman admits that he has indeed probably selected facts that bolster his case and that the experts he quotes may not always be right. Nevertheless, he believes he has demonstrated that most experts are likely to be wrong and, more importantly, has given the reader tools to help weigh expert pronouncements.</p>
<p>This he has done. His guidelines are enlightening. If we are willing to think critically, we need not be helpless before conflicting expertise. In other words, if we don't bring our brains to the tasting, we shouldn't complain about the snake oil.</p>

<p>Eek -- germs! Kill 'em! Germ phobia can mean insufficient exposure to microorganisms that help build our immune systems, but some of those nasty critters really should be avoided. That's what makes products like Lysol Disinfecting Wipes appealing.</p>
<p>Just remember: the instant you touch a sanitized surface, some germs are back.</p>
<p>What's more, products are generally tested under artificial lab conditions, a far cry from the typical kitchen or bathroom where cross-contamination and less-than-perfect product application are almost inevitable.</p>
<p>As well, off-the-shelf cleaning products don't kill all bugs.</p>
<p>As a low-cost alternative for wiping down counters and kitchen equipment, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency suggests a simple mix of bleach and water</p>
<p>(inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/concen/cause/ecolie.shtml).</p>
<p>FRONT</p>
<p>Kills Influenza A Virus: Check the back panel to see what this really means.</p>
<p>Kills 99.9 per cent of germs: According to a recent Wall Street Journal story, under lab conditions, the product killed 99.9 per cent of a representative sample of microorganisms. It doesn't mean it's effective against all bugs.</p>
<p>BACK</p>
<p>Influenza A Virus/Strain New Caledonia 20/99: The Influenza A virus is a leading cause of seasonal flus; the New Caledonia 20/99 strain emerged in 1999 and spread rapidly.</p>
<p>Avian Influenza (H1N1): A strain of influenza that has a high mortality rate among infected humans, but is considered by Health Canada an "extremely low" risk for Canadians. Not to be confused with swine flu, deemed a pandemic by the World Health Organization last year.</p>
<p>Salmonella choleraesuis: Transmitted by poultry and other animal feces; symptoms include diarrhea, abdominal cramps and fever. Not a reason to wipe down that chicken with Lysol.</p>
<p>Escherichia coli (E. coli): Transmitted by animal feces; causes severe abdominal cramping and, in extreme cases, death, as it did in the Walkerton, Ont. outbreak in 2000. Like salmonella and most other nasty stuff, E. coli is killed by cooking.</p>
<p>The other germs listed are a witch's brew found in animals, the soil and water, all of them with nasty symptoms. Human Coronavirus, for example, causes respiratory and gastrointestinal illness including SARS. Urinary tract infections, dermatitis, and bone and joint infections are just some of what pseudomonas aeruginosa brings in its wake.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Gulf Coast tourism wants BP aid, loans</b>
</div><div>Sara K. Clarke Orlando Sentinel  </div>
<div>484 words</div><div>24 July 2010</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>MET</div><div>T05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>

<p>ORLANDO, Fla.</p>
<p>The nation's biggest travel trade group says the BP oil spill will cost the Gulf region's tourism industry $7.6 billion to $22.7 billion, with most of the economic damage falling on Florida.</p>
<p>The U.S. Travel Association, in releasing a study it commissioned from Oxford Economics, asked for the federal government's help in securing $500 million for an "emergency" marketing campaign from BP, the British oil company whose blown-out well is the source of the giant spill.</p>
<p>The industry trade group said the disaster, triggered by an explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig in April, could cost coastal-tourism interests and those that do business with them $7.6 billion during 15 months or as much as $22.7 billion over three years.</p>
<p>Both sets of figures are based on historical data drawn from 25 natural and man-made disasters as well as National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration forecasts on where the oil may wind up. The upper-range assumes the oil will find its way around the Florida Peninsula to the Atlantic Coast.</p>
<p>"In the wake of any disaster, facts often take a back seat to fears and to rumours," Roger Dow, president and travel association CEO, said in calling for additional marketing and advertising. "The result is people moving elsewhere and cancelling plans."</p>
<p>In the worst-case scenario, Florida's $60 billion-a-year tourism economy would sustain more than three-fourths of the region's financial losses, or $18.6 billion during the three years, according to the Oxford study.</p>
<p>The study looked at previous disasters that have harmed tourism, such as hurricane Katrina in 2005; the recent H1N1 outbreaks that tainted the industry in Mexico; the Asian tsunami in 2004; and other oil spills such as the Exxon Valdez in 1989 and the Ixtoc spill near the Yucatan Peninsula in 1979.</p>
<p>The travel group, as part of a 10-point plan it calls Roadmap to Recovery, hopes to convince the federal government and BP that spending $500 million now on an oil-response marketing fund could generate $7.5 billion in tourism spending that would offset the group's projected losses.</p>
<p>"It is more cost-effective than dealing with the damages after the fact," said Adam Sacks, managing director of Oxford Economics USA.</p>
<p>In addition to marketing dollars from BP, the tourism industry is asking the U.S. government for help getting businesses access to loans and tax incentives that could help them remain open, and for incentives that would promote travel to disaster-affected areas.</p>
<p>Tourism supports 400,000 Gulf Coast jobs, where leisure-and-hospitality employment in coastal counties accounts for 15 per cent of all private-sector jobs.</p>

<p>MEXICO CITY</p>
<p>They sniffed the concha rolls, scrutinized the granola, photographed the salsa and nibbled the chilaquiles, Mexico's crunchy-warm breakfast of corn tortillas fried in eggs and tomatillo sauce.</p>
<p>Amid the fresh squeezed orange juice and high-altitude sunshine at the rooftop bistro there was a buzz of excitement - and whispers of "save room for later" - as 100 chefs, journalists, researchers and foodies took their first bites of a 10-day "Aromas and Flavours" gastronomical tour of Mexico, part of the government's latest effort to attract tourists interested in something other than beaches and pyramids.</p>
<p>"We're excited to help Mexico improve its image, sharing all the richness, variety, flavours and abundance of dishes that are Mexican cuisine," said Mexico City's tourism director Alejandro Rojas Diaz Duran.</p>
<p>A typical Mexican culinary tour day starts with fresh mango and papaya, hand-beaten hot chocolate, sweet rolls in fresh double-clotted cream, eggs poached in a spicy turkey stew. As the hours pass, there are pork loin tacos, then small fried battered fish, fresh tortillas, toasted grasshoppers sprinkled with salt and lime, roasted corn on the cob dipped in chili powder, slow-cooked cow head, chicken vegetable soup and the omnipresent rice, beans, avocado and salsa.</p>
<p>"We're going to eat and drink and eat and drink and eat and drink!" laughed food writer Betty Fussell, leafing through an itinerary that will take busloads of adventurous eaters through five states.</p>
<p>At the helm of this barely containable passel of wandering, sampling, questioning foodies is the ever-serene chef and restaurateur Patricia Quintana, Mexico's official Cuisine Ambassadress, who herds her minions from restaurant to market to museum without raising her voice or dropping her serene smile.</p>
<p>For Quintana, whose work is subsidized by Mexico's government, bringing gastronomical tourism to her country is a labour of love.</p>
<p>"Mexico offers innumerable riches for tourism, but beyond the beaches, the archeological sites and the ecotourism, there's the cuisine, which should be known throughout the world, providing magnificent opportunities for visitors," she said.</p>
<p>Quintana's tour is one of many now available to would-be tourists in Mexico. Dozens of culinary guides offer tours that can be as short as an afternoon to several weeks. Prices vary, but are typically about $350 per day including hotel rooms and lots of food. Many tours include cooking lessons, too.</p>
<p>The burgeoning industry was launched last year when Mexico's government began investing in culinary tourism as swine flu and drug cartel violence put a dent in the country's second most lucrative industry.</p>
<p>In addition to subsidizing some culinary tour guides, the government has also launched a series of "culinary routes" in the country. The Thousand Flavours of the Mole route features Tlaxcala, Puebla and Oaxaca, cities known for their history, culture and cooking of the complex Mexican culinary specialty, mole. They are mapped out, with hotel and restaurant recommendations.</p>
<p>"We know that today, more than ever, to attract tourists and enhance their stays and spending in our country, it is necessary to provide products and services with greater added value and that are differentiated according to the tastes, time and resources of each traveller," said Mexico's tourism director Gloria Guevara.</p>
<p>And while culinary tours incorporate the history, the focus is on eating. And eating. Days begin as early as 6:30 a.m. (eggs with cactus, sweet rolls with locally grown cinnamon) and can end as late as 1 a.m. (tequila and salty nuts, fresh cheese platters, tropical fruit sorbets) with visits to chili roasters and tequila distilleries, along with convents, museums and castles.</p>
<p>They have private seatings in Mexico's finest restaurants and gather in homes of traditional Mexican women cooking the same dishes their Aztec ancestors made.</p>
<p>"To see the foods is wonderful, but to taste so much in just 10 days, it's stupendous," said Jose Luis Curiel, a chemical engineer who teaches cooking in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Food, in Mexico, takes a prominent place in society. Restaurants are the second largest private employers in the country, with 4.8 million involved in the business.</p>
<p>Life revolves around food here. Mexicans typically eat four meals a day, coffee and a roll at sun-up, eggs and meat a few hours later, a heavy afternoon meal that can take a few hours and several courses, and a warm drink with bread or tortillas before bed. And snacks.</p>
<p>"In Mexico, cooking is like alchemy, like magic, when you see how they combine ancient ingredients to make a mole or a salsa. The more I see, the more I realize I have to learn about our cuisine," said tour-goer Pedro Sanudo.</p>
<p>"I don't know of any other country with so many tastes," said food writer Herdis Luke, of Hamburg, Germany, with a sigh.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Does walking make you head to the fridge? Pneumonia vaccine may protect your heart, tooOutwit your genes: eat a Mediterranean diet</b>
</div><div>Michael Roizen, MD & Mehmet Oz, MD   </div>
<div>805 words</div><div>21 July 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>E3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>One excuse for not walking always gets "give me a break" looks from us: "Exercise makes me hungry."</p>
<p>We always thought it crazy that we'd see people leave the gym and head to <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>.</p>
<p>But now there's some evidence that exercise may stimulate hunger. Does working out wake up gherkin, your "feed me" hormone? Not if you're a slim, healthy young male. But if you're a woman, maybe. And if you're a not-so-slim-or-young guy? No one's sure yet.</p>
<p>Hang on a minute, though. If the first thing you do after your walk is nose around the pantry, could it be that "I deserve it" has entered your mind? If so, your emotions are behind some of your munches.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's some evidence that if you're a woman, your body is programmed to get hungry after a little cardio. Not fair, we know. And it's not a fact yet, either; researchers are still trying to sort out what happens to gherkin after exercise, and a new study showed it didn't change after an hour of brisk walking.</p>
<p>But - and it's a big but - the walkers were healthy, slim, young dudes. Other studies show that some pudgy women's hormones reacted differently. And who knows about tubby, middle-aged guys?</p>
<p>We like to give you solutions - and early research indicates that there is one: if you feel like you have a genuine appetite surge after walking, add strength training to your cardio. The combo increases the "I'm full" hormones in your bloodstream. Put another way: weight work helps waist loss.</p>
<p>Pneumonia vaccine may protect your heart, too</p>
<p>Some things are better done sooner rather than later, like putting money in your RRSP, buying Beyonc concert tickets, and, oh yeah, getting a pneumonia vaccination when you turn 50 - or 15 years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Why the big hustle-up?</p>
<p>There's substantial (but controversial) evidence that the pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine may dampen the fire of inflammation and keep artery-blocking plaque from rupturing and causing a heart attack or stroke - especially if you're at risk of heart disease.</p>
<p>In fact, the rate of myocardial infarction (emergency room talk for heart attack) was 50 per cent lower in people who had gotten the shot two years earlier than recommended, according to a recent Canadian hospital study.</p>
<p>There are a couple of theories about why a vaccine that neuters nasty pneumonia bugs also protects your heart. One is that it specifically inhibits the kind of inflammation that riles up cardiovascular disease.</p>
<p>Another is that the antibodies it generates handcuff lousy LDL cholesterol in a way that keeps the cholesterol from building plaque in your arteries.</p>
<p>But frankly, we're not waiting for the definitive explanation to get the shot (Oz just turned 50, so he's due).</p>
<p>Not getting pneumonia or heart disease is more than reason enough for us - and you - to get vaccinated. If you need another prod, consider this: About one-third of deaths blamed on the H1N1 flu, which is still lurking out there, have been in people who've also had bacterial pneumonia.</p>
<p>Outwit your genes: eat</p>
<p>a Mediterranean diet</p>
<p>If heart disease runs in your family, you need to fight back like David Haye defending his heavyweight title.</p>
<p>Your future may depend on delivering a genetic power punch, and now research shows just how to throw it: Start eating Mediterranean-style - lots of fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains; the heart-healthy fat in olive oil (canola's even better); fish, of course (salmon and trout - you gotta get your omega-3s); some naked (skinless) poultry; very little red meat; and a glass of red wine every night.</p>
<p>Sound like same-old-same-old to you? OK, we're busted. We spread Mediterranean's positivity nearly as often as we warn of the dangers in belly fat.</p>
<p>The best foods for your heart (and waist) come primarily from plants: whole wheat, hummus, grape leaves, apricots, white corn, walnuts ... the whole delish list. Eating like a Greek defends you from memory loss, depression, joint pain, heart disease, stroke and diabetes.</p>
<p>A new study shows Med helps you outwit one of the biggest risk factors for a heart attack: relatives. In men with a family history of troubled tickers, the ones who ate the most foods typical of a Mediterranean diet had the healthiest hearts.</p>
<p>Today's take-away: The more Mediterranean foods you swap for processed foods and saturated fats, the more likely you'll knock out a heart-disease history.</p>

</p>
<p>Nearly one million cases of H1N1 and 52 deaths caused by human swine flu were prevented in Ontario alone by the controversial mass immunization campaign, according to new Canadian research.</p>
<p>The study is believed to be the first to investigate the cost-effectiveness of the largest immunization program in the country's history.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers estimated that the H1N1 flu shots prevented 420 hospitalizations, 28,000 visits to hospital emergency departments and 100,000 visits to a doctors' offices in Ontario, even though the vaccines were only rolled out in late October -nine weeks into the fall wave.</p>
<p>"The vaccine was implemented quite late -at the height of the pandemic -and it takes about two weeks for the vaccine to take effect. Even then we could save enough patients to make it worthwhile," said Beate Sander, a University of Toronto doctoral student and health economist.</p>
<p>As of April, 428 H1N1 deaths had been reported in Canada -128 of them in Ontario -and nearly 9,000 hospitalizations. A total of 1,843 of the hospitalizations were in Ontario.</p>
<p>The fall wave of the first flu pandemic in 41 years began in the first week of September, peaked in early November and tapered off by late January.</p>
<p>Ontario's $180-million mass immunization program began Oct. 26 -two weeks before the peak. More than one-third (37 per cent) of the population had been vaccinated 16 weeks into the outbreak, and almost half (45 per cent) were vaccinated by the end of the outbreak, according to data available at the time of the study.</p>
<p>"When the program was rolled out, there was so much negative press about how expensive it is, what a waste of money it is," Sander said. "We wanted to look at it in a more objective way."</p>
<p>The researchers predicted that without a mass flu vaccine program, 4.1 million cases of flu would have occurred in Ontario.</p>
<p>Reporting in the journal Vaccine, the Toronto team estimated the campaign prevented about 900,000 cases of flu, 105,080 visits to doctors, 28,721 emergency visits, 427 hospitalizations and 52 deaths, and saved an estimated $20 million in health costs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tijuana's Pellow plays for love of game; Because Cimarrones have yet to pay any players this season</b>

</p>
<p>After a 26-day road trip, Kit Pellow and the Tijuana Cimarrones are anxious to get home.</p>
<p>They last played in Tijuana, Mexico, on June 24, and will head back home after a three-game Golden Baseball League series with the Edmonton Capitals that finishes on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Of course, for the time being, that home is in Yuma, Ariz.</p>
<p>"It's been a long (road trip), and with everything that's been going on off the field, it feels like we've been here two or three months," said Pellow, the only member of the Cimarrones who has been with the team since the start of the season.</p>
<p>"I guess we're going to be playing our home games in Yuma for a little while. The word I get is that they're still trying to fix the field and the stuff in Tijuana, so maybe we can go back there for the last month of the season, but as far as everybody knows right now, we're going back to Yuma."</p>
<p>It's the latest in a long string of setbacks for the Tijuana franchise, which is trying to get established in the GBL. The Cimarrones' inaugural season in 2009 was cancelled due to the swine flu epidemic, and this season has been mired with losses -- the team is 6-42 on the season -- and financial turmoil.</p>
<p>"I haven't been paid all year. I didn't miss one paycheque or two paycheques or three. I haven't been paid all year," Pellow admitted before Monday's game.</p>
<p>"Supposedly, the representatives in Tijuana still have the ball rolling ... so I guess they're still putting the money in to pay us. Nobody's been paid yet, but today's the day they said we were getting paid, so we'll see."</p>
<p>Additionally, the Golden League has assumed operations of the team after the owners' financial woes led to an embarrassing incident where the team forfeited a home game to Maui after their uniforms were repossessed, the team never having paid for them.</p>
<p>The team now dons red jerseys with a black T on the chest, as opposed to their original green and yellow outfits.</p>
<p>The roster has also entirely changed -- with the exception of Pellow -- after many of the veterans who originally played for Tijuana left in mid-June.</p>
<p>"I'd rather have the green (jerseys). They were more comfortable. That was the best thing about the first team," said the 36-year-old Pellow, who played the past two seasons with the Calgary Vipers.</p>
<p>Following the forfeit, Tijuana's final home stand of the first half was moved to Yuma, where the team donned -- for just two games -- the uniforms of the San Luis Heat and played on a practice field at Yuma's Desert Sun Stadium, where the team will play all of its home games for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The constant distractions have taken a toll on the team, including Pellow, who has a leadership role with what he calls "the new team" of young players that currently comprise the Cimarrones.</p>
<p>"It's tough right now because you don't know where your paycheques are coming from, where you're going to be, your home field. Is there meal money? Is there travel? Stuff like that," Pellow explained.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying that's why we've lost all the games we've lost, but it certainly doesn't help. ... It's just one thing after another. Is it the travel? Is it the not getting paid? Are we going to get meal money tomorrow?</p>
<p>"Everybody says, 'When you go on the field,' it's just baseball. Well, it's not. In the moment, if you're making a play, you're not thinking about it, but any other time, you're thinking about it. Trust me."</p>
<p>NIGHT CAPS: At least one Cimarrone player was pleased to hear that Daryl Arreola pitched on Monday. Infielder Brett Grayson was also part of the Yuma exodus last week, getting traded to Tijuana while the team was playing in Calgary. As a result, Grayson has got a lot of use out of QEII Highway, playing for Yuma in Edmonton on Thursday, going to Calgary to join the Cimarrones for games on Friday, Saturday and Sunday before coming back to Edmonton for Tijuana's current series.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>CAPITALS 13 CIMARRONES 2</p>
<p>The Edmonton Capitals proved Monday night that they didn't need to hit the long ball to score runs.</p>
<p>The Capitals scored three runs on sacrifice flies, two more on errors and one on a passed ball to win for the third day in a row and the 18th time in their last 20 games as they downed the Tijuana Cimarrones 13-2 at Telus Field.</p>
<p>Daryl Arreola, who made his first start with the Capitals since being acquired from the Yuma Scorpions last week, pitched a complete-game five-hitter to pick up his Golden Baseball League-leading eighth win.</p>
<p>Edmonton got all of the runs it needed in the first inning, scoring twice on an error and a sacrifice fly from Matt Rogelstad. Cliff Brumbaugh and Ryan Stevenson added sac flies of their own in the fourth and seventh innings, respectively.</p>
<p>Enrique Cruz had the lone big fly of the night, going deep over the scoreboard in left field for a solo shot in the sixth inning. Cruz's third home run of the season capped a five-for-six night for the shortstop, who finished with two runs scored and two RBIs.</p>
<p>Brumbaugh also picked up a pair of hits and RBIs, while third baseman Alex Prieto and catcher Nick Valdez chipped in with multi-hit games of their own as the Caps stroked 15 hits.</p>
<p>Edmonton also took advantage of four Tijuana errors to score three unearned runs.</p>
<p>Tijuana and Edmonton take the field with an early 11:30 a.m. start for Kids Take Over Day at the ballpark.</p>

<p>Re: Election tricks are legal, but are they ethical? July 18.</p>
<p>Columnist Randall Denley associates my advertisement in community newspapers regarding the city's light-rail transit plan with "election tricks" and questions my principles. He is wrong on both counts.</p>
<p>He appears to have bought mayoral candidate Jim Watson's complaint about these ads as "unfair use of tax dollars" despite the fact that the ads speak to an important city issue and despite Watson's clear self-interest.</p>
<p>These ads are part of public business that city councillors are elected to do. They were designed by city staff to inform the public about the progress of the city's plan following the recent announcement of federal funding, the final step to enable this project to go ahead.</p>
<p>The ads' timing has nothing to do with the municipal election -- the federal funding was announced late last month and advertising schedules only permitted these ads to appear in the July 8 community newspapers. The ads were consistent with an earlier ad with my name and picture last October, also designed by city staff, following council's final approval of this important project. As chair of the council's transit committee, I am the face and name on these ads regarding the city's plan.</p>
<p>I doubt if there would have been any comment by Watson if the ad was placed by any of my other council colleagues. Councillor Diane Deans, chair of the community and protective services committee, responsible for public health), appeared in an ad on the city's H1N1 flu vaccination program without any reaction.</p>
<p>Denley thinks that the rules on municipal advertising should be tightened, but why stop there? In the six months leading to his registration to become a candidate for mayor, Watson as MPP appeared in 11 half-page and full-page ads in community newspapers in Ottawa. Denley should question Watson's ethics.</p>
<p>Denley mentions the ethical position of "some candidates" in not accepting campaign contributions from developers who do business with council. Denley fails to mention that my colleague Clive Doucet and myself do not accept contributions from developers, but mayoral candidates Larry O'Brien and Watson have.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Does walking make you hungry?</b>

</p>
<p>One excuse for not walking always gets "give me a break" looks from us: "Exercise makes me hungry." We always thought it crazy that we'd see people leave the gym and head to <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>. But now there's some evidence that exercise may stimulate hunger. Does working out wake up gherlin, your "feed me" hormone? Not if you're a slim, healthy young male. But if you're a woman, maybe. And if you're a not-so-slim-or-young guy? No one's sure yet.</p>
<p>Hang on for a minute, though. If the first thing you do after your walk is nose around the pantry, could it be that "I deserve it" has entered your mind? If so, your emotions are behind some of your munchies.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there's some evidence that if you're a woman, your body is programmed to get hungry after a little cardio. Not fair, we know. And it's not a fact yet, either; researchers are still trying to sort out what happens to gherlin after exercise, and a new study showed it didn't change after an hour of brisk walking. But - and it's a big but - the walkers were healthy, slim, young dudes. Other studies show that some pudgy women's hormones reacted differently. And who knows about tubby, middle-aged guys?</p>
<p>We You Docs like to give you solutions - and early research indicates that there is one: If you feel like you have a genuine appetite surge after walking, add strength training to your cardio. The combo increases the "I'm full" hormones in your bloodstream. Put another way: weight work helps waist loss.</p>
<p>Pneumonia vaccine may help heart, too</p>
<p>Some things are better done sooner rather than later, like putting money in your RRSP, buying Beyonce concert tickets, and, oh yeah, getting a pneumonia vaccination when you turn 50 - or 15 years ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>Why the big hustle-up? There's substantial (but controversial) evidence that the PPSV shot (pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine) may dampen the fire of inflammation and keep artery-blocking plaque from rupturing and causing a heart attack or stroke - especially if you're at risk of heart disease. In fact, the rate of myocardial infarction (ER talk for heart attack) was 50 per cent lower in people who had gotten the shot two years earlier than recommended, according to a recent Canadian hospital study.</p>
<p>There are a couple of theories about why a vaccine that neuters nasty pneumonia bugs also protects your heart. One is that it specifically inhibits the kind of inflammation that riles up cardiovascular disease. Another is that the antibodies it generates handcuff lousy LDL cholesterol in a way that keeps the cholesterol from building plaque in your arteries.</p>
<p>But frankly, we're not waiting for the definitive explanation to get the shot (Oz just turned 50, so he's due). Not getting pneumonia or heart disease is more than reason enough to get vaccinated. If you need another prod, consider this: about one-third of deaths blamed on H1N1 , which is still lurking out there, have been in people who've also had bacterial pneumonia.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario’s H1N1 program was worth the money, study finds; More than one million flu cases were averted despite the low vaccination rate, researchers determine</b>
</div><div>Caroline Alphonso  </div>

</p>
<p>Even failures can have a silver lining: Ontario had the lowest H1N1 vaccination rate in the country, but the millions of dollars poured into its program averted nearly one million cases of pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>A new analysis, believed to be the first to look at the cost-effectiveness of the immunization program, found that despite the controversy surrounding Ontario’s $180-million mass immunization program and the low uptake, the dollars proved to be worth it. The rollout of the vaccine last fall saved 50 lives and prevented 420 hospital admissions, 28,000 visits to emergency departments and 100,000 visits to doctors’ offices.</p>
<p>Lead author Beate Sander, who undertook the analysis as a doctoral student at the University of Toronto’s faculty of medicine, said the study is proof that Ontario residents got enough bang for their buck. “Things can be costly, and still be cost-effective,” she said. “It [the vaccine rollout] was early enough to provide value for money.”</p>
<p>The study, published in this month’s issue of the journal Vaccine, runs counter to the criticism levelled against Ontario, and much of Canada, that its campaign to protect Canadians against an influenza pandemic failed dramatically, because of low vaccination rates in many parts of the country. Even Ontario’s chief medical officer of health, Arlene King, acknowledged last month that public-health officials neglected to properly organize a mass immunization program.</p>
<p>Only about a third of residents in the country’s most populous province got the shot, the lowest vaccination rate, according to a Statistics Canada survey released Monday. And less than half – 41 per cent – of Canadians lined up to receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>Public-health officials and medical experts, taking stock of the country’s response to the pandemic, point to three reasons for the low vaccination rates: a failure to communicate the risks of the pandemic and the safety of the adjuvant; sequencing guidelines that gave priority to high-risk groups and were not followed by some provinces, confusing the public; and Ottawa’s inability to inform provinces fully of the weekly vaccine supply, which stalled planning.</p>
<p>But Ms. Sander and her colleagues found that coverage of the mass vaccination program focused too much on the costs, and not the overall health benefits.</p>
<p>“We wanted to look at it in a formal and objective way,” said Ms. Sander, now a health economist at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. “One always has to put costs into context. Most vaccination programs are cost-effective.”</p>
<p>Using mathematical modelling, the researchers predicted what would have happened if no intervention had been used to prevent the spread of H1N1 and the impact it would have had on the health-care system. Those figures were compared with the actual number of deaths, hospital admissions and emergency-room visits in Ontario. The H1N1 vaccination program not only prevented about a million people from catching the virus, but also resulted in the province saving $20-million in health-care costs, the study found.</p>
<p>Ms. Sander noted that if the vaccine was rolled out a few weeks later, the program’s cost-effectiveness would have eroded considerably. “If you start earlier, it would be more effective and more cost-effective. If you start even later, it would be less effective and less cost-effective,” she said “It seems that in Ontario we were just right in time to make it cost-effective.”</p>
<p>Ontario, like much of the country, began vaccinating its population just before the peak of the second wave of H1N1. While many lined up to be vaccinated, a segment of the population was diagnosed with it early on and, as a result, was immune.</p>
<p>The research paper did not study the cost-effectiveness of the immunization program in other parts of the country. Ms. Sander said it would be difficult to say if the benefits elsewhere would be similar to that in Ontario, because much depends on how the program was rolled out and how the pandemic unfolded in each province.</p>

</div><div>By Jen Skerritt    </div>
<div>429 words</div><div>20 July 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>MANITOBA had one of the lowest H1N1 vaccination rates in the country, according to new data that show only 37 per cent of Manitobans over age 12 received the flu shot last fall.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada released data from the 2010 Canadian Community Health survey on Monday that revealed Manitoba fell below Canada's national H1N1 vaccination rate and had lower uptake than every province except Ontario and B.C. Manitoba and Alberta both vaccinated 37 per cent of the population against H1N1-- the third-lowest vaccine uptake in Canada.</p>
<p>The survey found 41 per cent of Canadians aged 12 and older got the H1N1 shot. The actual national figure is likely higher, because the report did not include people living in the northern territories -- where, earlier this year, uptake was estimated to be greater than 60 per cent in Nunavut and Northwest Territories and about 53 per cent in Yukon.</p>
<p>Dr. Elise Weiss, Manitoba Health spokeswoman for H1N1, said the province's rates may appear lower because the data don't include the number of young children who received the shot -- one of the priority groups Manitoba targeted when it rolled out flu clinics.</p>
<p>Weiss said they also don't reflect some of the success Manitoba had vaccinating First Nations against H1N1. She said 90 per cent of residents living in some northern First Nations communities got the H1N1 shot, and the province was able to vaccinate more than 450,000 people against influenza.</p>
<p>"I think that's a success," Weiss said.</p>
<p>She said Manitoba's influenza strategy focused on vaccinating those at risk of severe illness first, which meant flu shots weren't offered to the general public when they were rolled out last October. Weiss said Manitoba received a limited supply of the vaccine when immunization clinics first opened and public demand was at its peak.</p>
<p>Later, when Manitoba had a larger vaccine supply, Weiss said the public perception of the threat had waned.</p>
<p>"There was a lot of demand for the vaccine at a time when the supply was short," she said.</p>
<p>"(Later) there were fewer cases, the perception was that the second wave was dying down and risk was lower than it had been in early October."</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador had the highest vaccination rate at 69 per cent, while B.C. vaccinated 36 per cent and Ontario vaccinated 32 per cent of its population.</p>

</p>
<p>Two myths, that the H1N1 threat was overstated by hysterics at federal and provincial public health agencies, and that the cost of the mass immunization program was a misuse of public funds, are exposed and refuted in a paper published in the current number of the scholarly journal Vaccine.</p>
<p>Clearly, H1N1 was not the pandemic flu that virologists fear most. Its bark proved worse than its bite. But without a public health response, even a flawed one, this relatively benign pandemic flu (though a surprising number of healthy young adults did become seriously ill, and some died) would have exacted a major toll on individuals, and on the public health-care system.</p>
<p>The problems with the country's response to H1N1 are well known. Statistics Canada reports just 41 per cent of Canadians aged 12 and older reported that they received the H1N1 vaccination during the last flu season, and that younger Canadians were less likely to receive the vaccination than older ones – even though the flu posed a threat to younger people as well. Only one province – Newfoundland and Labrador – achieved the national goal of a 70-per-cent H1N1 immunization rate. Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia, meanwhile, all fell below the national average of 41 per cent.</p>
<p>In the Vaccine paper, the health economist Beate Sanders points out that the Ontario program was implemented quite late, nine weeks into the fall wave. Despite this delay, the study (which only looked at Ontario) concludes the vaccine program averted nearly one million cases of H1N1 in that province, and as many as 50 deaths.</p>
<p>The study says Ontario could have seen an additional 420 hospitalizations, 28,000 visits to hospital emergency departments and 100,000 visits to doctors' offices if the province had not offered the flu-shot program. Suddenly, the $180-million cost is not an outrage to the public finances, but a very sensible expenditure. Not only were many spared severe illness, and some lives saved, but workplace productivity was preserved, and the decision to vaccinate proved “highly cost-effective despite the high program cost.”</p>
<p>Canada's public health officials need to learn from their mistakes; the lethargic approval process and tardy roll-out of the vaccine, even for the prioritized high-risk groups; the mysterious decision to keep older children off the list of high-risk groups; a costly and confusing top-down communications strategy that alternated between a don't-worry-be-happy approach and breathless declamations of impending doom.</p>
<p>The fact remains, though, that H1N1 could well have proved to be a much more serious disease than it did, and even knowing what we know now, the decision to pursue a national mass immunization program was the correct one.</p>

<p>Gerri Bischler wanted her husband to come with her on Sunday to the shores of Lac Ste Anne. But she said there is nothing she can do if he doesn't believe in the healing powers of the lake.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping and praying that my husband gets his eyes back," said Bischler, 83 of St. Albert. Her husband lost his sight after years of working as a welder. Bischler said she was healed herself when she cast away her cane after wading into the waters during a previous pilgrimage.</p>
<p>"I sat down in the water and hoped and prayed I could walk again -- and I did," Bischler said Sunday on the second day of the annual pilgrimage to Lac Ste Anne.</p>
<p>On Sunday's blessing of the lake, vehicles with license plates from Saskatchewan, the Northwest Territories and Manitoba filled the gravel lot in front of the church.</p>
<p>Lac Ste Anne became a pilgrimage site in the late 1800s, with Metis and First Nations making the journey to the lake to celebrate the Feast of Saint Anne, the grandmother of Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>The lake, about 75 kilometres northwest of Edmonton, is a place where people look for peace and seek the healing powers of the water. This year, 54,000 of the faithful are expected to make their way to the lake.</p>
<p>"We do believe -- we strongly believe it can help you heal anything," said Joyce Collins. Her daughter Elaine had her own son, Aven Conner, blessed on the rocky beach of Lac Ste Anne. Elaine said she's hoping the blessing and the visit to the lake can help with the bad dreams her son has been experiencing.</p>
<p>"Any hope that anyone can get is worth it," said Collins.</p>
<p>Dorothy Boucher, 49, is looking for healing from multiple sources at the pilgrimage. Several years ago, Boucher cut her knee and the injury resulted in an infection that led to blood poisoning. Subsequent injuries have left her on crutches. She is planning to meet with First Nations traditional medicine people for medical advice while also hoping the lake waters will help with her recovery.</p>
<p>"All walks of life -- it doesn't matter. It's here," said Boucher, thumping her chest with her fist.</p>
<p>The Lac Ste Anne pilgrimage and shrine blends First Nations and Roman Catholic traditions. The prayers of the Sunday service included those of First Nations, and a figure of the Risen Christ in the Lac Ste Anne shrine wears a sash adorned with a medicine wheel.</p>
<p>Archbishop Gerard Pettipas, who conducted the blessing of Lac Ste Anne Sunday, said the blessing of the lake doesn't necessarily make it something it is not -- the blessing is an acknowledgment of God's creation.</p>
<p>"If God made everything, then obviously he already has a relationship to everything in Earth," said Pettipas.</p>
<p>While Lac Ste Anne may be a holy site for many, it's not immune to financial troubles. Last year, H1N1 and the recession kept some of the pilgrims away, said Marlene Morin, the executive director of the pilgrimage.</p>
<p>Visitors are charged a $20 per vehicle overnight charge, so last year's low turnout resulted in cutbacks on some promotional materials, such as posters and letters.</p>
<p>"We're strapped as it is, and we'll always be strapped, so it doesn't help," said Morin.</p>
<p>She was cheered that attendance seemed to be up this year.</p>
<p>Sitting on a bench overlooking the calm waters of the lake, Bischler said her own mother was religious and also believed in the healing powers of the lake. When her mother was in her 80s, Bischler said she made the trek to Lac Ste Anne on foot. She spent one night sleeping in a ditch on her way, in the hopes that her pilgrimage would help her husband, who recently suffered a stroke.</p>
<p>"That's about all it is -- hope to heal someone," said Bischler.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Federal MPs departed the nation's capital for their ridings weeks ago but those hapless Senators that Canadians love to think do little work for their six-figure salaries did not.</p>
<p>Those on the Senate finance committee were busy for the last month debating the government's omnibus budget bill, and last week the entire Senate convened to debate it on third reading.</p>
<p>Well, the entire Senate except for 12 who were unable to be there for one of the most important votes of the year. Five Conservatives and seven Liberals were absent.</p>
<p>They were travelling, sick, or had personal issues. Conservative Hugh Segal recused himself from the vote because he sits on the board of a company the budget could affect.</p>
<p>At least one Liberal was absent because he had agreed to pair off with a Conservative who had other obligations. It's a common practice, used often when there is a significant reason for an absence such as a death in the family or a severe illness. (Although it was ignored last fall by the Conservatives when a Bloc MP asked to be paired for the gun registry vote because he had the H1N1 virus. The Conservatives refused, so he showed up with a face mask to cast his vote.)</p>
<p>Any budget bill is important and this one is no less so. It was also politically important for both the Conservatives and the Liberals. The Conservatives were already threatening to call an election over it if the bill wasn't passed.</p>
<p>So it was surprising how many senators were absent.</p>
<p>Granted, the extra sitting days were unexpected, as the Senate was scheduled to rise for summer break June 30. So the senators who were travelling, such as Manitoba Sen. Sharon Carstairs who was in Switzerland for a meeting of the Inter-Parliamentary Union human rights committee, likely would never have expected their travel plans to interfere with their voting duties when they booked their trips.</p>
<p>Still, one may wonder if the priorities for parliamentarians should be re-evaluated when more than 10 per cent of the chamber is missing for crucial votes.</p>
<p>Raining on Grits' parade</p>
<p>When even some Conservatives were muttering about pitying Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff last week, you knew he was having a rough go.</p>
<p>His Liberal Express national bus tour kicked off July 13 from Parliament Hill, but Mother Nature decided to literally rain on his parade. Since July 1, Ottawa has only received 15.4 mm of rain. Unfortunately for Ignatieff, 14.6 mm of that came on July 13 and most of it fell between 1 and 3 p.m. precisely when he was arriving for the big starting event -- complete with a band and a crowd of commissioned supporters -- on the grounds outside Centre Block.</p>
<p>A few hours later, the tour bus broke down on the side of the highway. Ignatieff, his wife, and the bevy of national media following them had to be rescued by Liberal party workers who were dispatched to pick them up by car and ferry them to their next stop in Cornwall, Ont. Within hours, the Conservatives had managed to get out a picture of the Liberal Express tour bus hitched to a tow truck. It wasn't exactly the image of the Liberal Express Ignatieff was banking on. Things continued to spiral on day two when it was reported the bus had been repaired at "Harper Diesel" and a stop at swanky Kingston restaurant Chez Piggy brought the NDP a chance to put out a cheeky menu outlining Liberal pork barrel politics.</p>
<p>While Ignatieff certainly isn't at fault for the bus's transmission woes, his team should be better prepared for these disasters. Would it have killed them to pay a bit more money to get the bus towed to a garage not bearing the same last name as the prime minister?</p>
<p>I suppose for Ignatieff there still may be a bright side to the bad start. It can't really get any worse for the tour. Or could it?</p>

<p>KEVIN SMITH is on the board of directors for the Centre for Inquiry, Canada's premier venue for humanists, skeptics and freethinkers.</p>
<p>God isn't dead after all; he is working at the Venter Institute in the United States. A team of scientists led by Dr. Craig Venter recently created a synthetic life form -- actually a new chromosome from artificial DNA. While this is a very simple bacterium, it is an exciting first step into creating artificial life.</p>
<p>As bioethicist Art Caplan claims, "it would seem to extinguish the argument that life requires a special force or power to exist."</p>
<p>This could kickstart others to venture forth with experiments that could help future generations with vaccines, new energy sources or the ability to deal with pollution. Imagine a bacterium that would thrive on licking up oil spills. According to the research team, if this technology had been available last year, we would have had an H1N1 vaccine ready in 24 hours, instead of several weeks.</p>
<p>Throughout human history, any beneficial discovery came with risks. The nervous nellies are already coming out from under their covers to warn of the dangers of "playing god" -- fearful of the unknown and preferring to stifle progress. Thankfully, humanists are forward-thinking and embrace positive change. Certainly we understand that safeguards must be in place to protect us from misuse. The potential for using this kind of research to make powerful bioweapons is a concern and must be discussed and debated, but you can't stop progress -- and why would you?</p>
<p>Venter says humanity's goals have always included trying to control nature, citing the development of agriculture and domesticating animals that led to what we eat today. In a nod to those who fear change, he assures them, "there's a big gap between science fiction and what your imagination can do and the reality in research labs."</p>
<p>There have always been humans who have been at the leading edge of discovering new ways to help our species survive. These are the kinds of gods I can believe in.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nation rehabilitation; It's an eco-paradise with bustling cities, but a fog of gunpowder and cocaine still hangs over its name. No matter how safe it gets, how do you rebrand a country like Colombia? Tavia Grant reports from Cartagena</b>

<p>Sweat pours from the audience as the band plays hypnotic Latin rhythms, flutes, drums, shakers. It feels like a thousand degrees. Doesn't matter – the crowd of all ages, blended races, sways to the music, eyes closed, sweating, smiling.</p>
<p>It could be any Latin American hot spot, from San Jose to Rio de Janeiro. It could be Havana in the 1950s. It's not. This is Cartagena, Colombia, 2010.</p>
<p>Mention you're visiting Colombia to friends, and you're likely to be met with: “I'll pitch in for your ransom money.” But today the country of cocaine, kidnappings and cartels is on a mission to revamp its reputation, once one of the world's worst. It wants to swap the Hollywood view – a land of narco-cartel godfathers dressed in camo and bandoliers, playing chicken with the lives of kidnapped Western businessmen – for the image of a place to golf, learn salsa and swim with dolphins.</p>
<p>Officials will pepper you with optimistic statistics: Kidnappings have plunged 90 per cent in the past eight years. Tourism has doubled in the past decade, reaching 2.5 million people last year. Foreign direct investment has tripled.</p>
<p>Any visit to the bustling streets of Bogotá or sultry Cartagena confirms the claims aren't all hot air. Bogotá is hopping with commerce and construction. Tourists from Brazil, Japan and Canada flock to the 500-year-old walled city of Cartagena. Even Medellin, once synonymous with drug violence, is home to discos, museums and a mammoth annual flower festival.</p>
<p>Indeed, The New York Times listed Colombia in its top 31 places to go in 2010, saying Bogotá has become “a role model of urban reinvention,” and calls Cartagena the next Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>Lonely Planet ranked Colombia in its top 10 list of happiest places in the world. Robert Reid, co-author of the last edition, says, “Would I take my mom there? I would in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>“There is so much to do just in Bogotá,” he says. “You can go to sushi bars and salsatecas at midnight in the north end and feel completely safe – safer than walking around New York City.”</p>
<p>The euphoria in travel circles may gloss over some of the real and persistent challenges still facing the country – nearly half the population lives below the poverty line, joblessness is the highest in South America and human-rights abuse is still an issue. But the story its leaders want to tell is summed up in the first two words of Mr. Reid's guide: “Colombia's back.”</p>
<p>There are plenty of reasons it should be an obvious tourist and trade destination. It has never defaulted on its debt. The oldest democracy in the southern hemisphere, it is also a land of great natural beauty.</p>
<p>The country is diverse, strapped by two oceans, the Atlantic and Pacific, laced with three mountain ranges, jungle, coastline, savannah and Caribbean islands. Its cloud forests are as rich in species as the Amazon, according to the Nature Conservancy. It also has the highest number of exotic bird species, frogs, and variety of orchids in the world; the World Wildlife Fund ranks it fifth in terms of biodiversity.</p>
<p>But the country of Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Shakira has been through rough times. A steady stream of news stories through the past 30 years alone, about the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrillas, has prompted people to visit Ecuador, Argentina or Costa Rica instead.</p>
<p>Many of the current changes afoot in Colombia are credited to outgoing President Alvaro Uribe's security policies. Under his watch, backed by funding from the U.S., thousands of paramilitaries and guerrillas have exchanged guns for civilian clothes. FARC attacks have subsided, with most of the internal conflict shifting out of cities to remote areas.</p>
<p>This past Tuesday, Venezuela handed over to U.S. officials Carlos “Beto” Renteria, the last free leader of Colombia's top drug gang, the Norte del Valle cartel, and one of the world's most wanted cocaine smugglers.</p>
<p>As well, after 60 years, the guerrillas seem to be losing hope. Luis Mendieta, a police general who was released from captivity last month after 12 years, told reporters that in that time he'd seen morale sink among FARC cadres while Colombia's bedraggled military transformed itself into a formidable force.</p>
<p>If, as upbeat observers say, the Colombian people have gotten their country back, they now feel ready to offer it to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>MAGAZINE COVERS TURN FROM BANDITS TO BABES</p>
<p>In Rodolfo Moseres Dieppa's Toronto office, two four-foot posters of Sports Illustrated's 2006 swimsuit edition with alluring Colombian models adorning the walls: a cover with bikini-clad women and an inside page, featuring an article with the headline, “Magical Realism.” It was the first large-circulation magazine to run a glowing travel piece.</p>
<p>It was a far cry from an earlier National Geographic cover of a bullet-bedecked drug runner, the headline in capital letters: COCAINE COUNTRY.</p>
<p>That appeared in 2002, when Mr. Dieppa had just arrived in Canada from Bogotá, tasked with promoting trade and tourism to Canada.</p>
<p>“How can you sell tourism when people see that?” Mr. Dieppa says. As for trade, “eight years ago, asking someone to set up shop in Colombia, they would look at me and say, ‘Are you kidding?'”</p>
<p>At the time Canadians had one of the “coldest” or most negative perceptions about Colombia in the world, a global branding survey showed. Mr. Dieppa would phone tour operators such as Gap Adventures and be told not to bother calling back for five years.</p>
<p>Without a budget to launch a glitzy marketing campaign such as Spain's or India's, his agency began to target influential people – business executives, politicians, journalists – and offer them free trips.</p>
<p>A FashionTelevision crew went. More than 150 travel agents were given free two-day trips. Hundreds of Canadian business leaders travelled to Cartagena, where they met local executives in a corporate equivalent of speed-dating – with some snags.</p>
<p>On each of the six trips, a few executives would get last-minute cold feet and refuse to board the plane. Mr. Dieppa calls them “the Disappeared Canadians.”</p>
<p>But, after thousands of presentations, greeted with polite skepticism, Canadians were finally tempted by “the physical story,” Mr. Dieppa says: “That it's closer than you think. That we have a 94-per-cent literacy rate. That 70 per cent of our electricity is green and that we're the size of Ontario, but with five distinctive regions.”</p>
<p>The influx of foreign investment – investors from India to Argentina are laying big bets on the country's prospects and diminished security risks – is one sign efforts are paying off. Canadian visits to Colombia have more than doubled in eight years. Air Canada now makes direct flights from Toronto or Vancouver to Bogotá four times a week.</p>
<p>Colombia aimed to attract four million visitors in 2009 but fell short due to factors such as H1N1 and the global economic crisis. Still it says it saw 16 per cent growth in foreign arrivals last year while the world average contracted by 4 per cent.</p>
<p>Global hotel chains such as Marriott are expanding in the country, lured by a 30-year tax exemption on services in new hotels. Cruise ships increased 35 per cent from 2008 to 2009.</p>
<p>Canaccord Genuity oil analyst Frederick Kozak of Calgary, who has visited Colombia about a dozen times in the past three years, has written copiously on the shift.</p>
<p>“There is still a perception about Colombia that it's dangerous,” he says. “I keep cranking out these reports saying it's not. It's not a banana republic.”</p>
<p>YOU CAN DRINK THE WATER, BUT CAN THEY CLEAR THE AIR?</p>
<p>The bad reputation that precedes Colombia can be an advantage when people do get here, as there's plenty of potential to surprise: Streets in main cities are closed to cars on Sundays, making room for cyclists and joggers. You can drink the tap water in the main cities. Its universities and hospitals are among the best on the continent.</p>
<p>There are signs tourism is a young industry. English is rare, and English menus nearly non-existent. On the plus side, Colombian waiters, mango sellers and cab drivers are not yet jaded; they are welcoming to tourists. Taxis don't overcharge. While the military and police presence is pervasive, they tolerate having their photos taken.</p>
<p>A current tourism slogan makes a cheeky reference to past strife: “Colombia: the only risk is wanting to stay.”</p>
<p>But one nation-brand expert warns that slogans alone will not make visitors feel safe. Confronting and solving problems is what shifts perceptions, according to Simon Anholt of London, who runs the annual Anholt-Gfk Roper Nation Brands Index.</p>
<p>“The answer for Colombia is absolutely not to attempt to deny or contradict or sweep its negative stuff under the carpet,” he says. “It's to demonstrate how effective it is at tackling that stuff.”</p>
<p>Thus, a tourism investment brochure includes murder rates, showing Bogotá is now safer than Washington, D.C. A glossy trade commission report is full of stats showing fewer terrorist attacks and lower cocaine production. And it openly acknowledges scandals such as illegal wiretapping of judges and journalists, along with references to 2008 killings of civilians by members of the armed forces.</p>
<p>Amnesty International and the United Nations remain concerned about human-rights abuses. But the Colombian government, which will see Juan Manuel Santos become president in August, has repeatedly said human rights groups can have access to any part of the country.</p>
<p>As Colombia regains its footing, it will have new problems to solve. For instance, the twin aims of making the country secure for tourists and the parallel effort to attract investment may well wind up at odds – an open-door policy to mining and energy firms could conflict with drives to promote ecotourism.</p>
<p>It's not that easy being green</p>
<p>Ecotourism is heavily promoted in the Amazon region near Brazil, where you can stay in jungle lodges, and in the Tayrona Park on the Caribbean coastline, where the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy mountain range and the posadas, or inns, are sprinkled throughout.</p>
<p>It's all part of a national effort by the federal government that encourages rural families to stop growing coca and instead work in local tourism and sustainable farming.</p>
<p>The stakes are rising. According to Toronto-based Colombian trade commissioner Maria Fernanda Guzman, tourism is already the country's third foreign-exchange earner after oil and coal: “In 2009 the level is a little over $2.6-billion dollars [U.S.], surpassing our coffee exports.”</p>
<p>She is adamant that environmental awareness is high and regulators will stop development if companies don't follow the rules.</p>
<p>In March, the Constitutional Court ordered a halt to Colombia's largest copper-mining project, citing a lack of consultation with nearby indigenous and Afro-Colombian communities regarding the environmental and cultural impact of the mine.</p>
<p>There's no question that this remains a country in transition, where a violent history frequently still flickers into the light. Colombia has, after all, known only 47 years of peace in its 200 years of independent existence.</p>
<p>But that doesn't faze Jack Scott, a Canadian who is chief operating officer of <span class="companylink">Petrominerales</span> Energy and has lived in Bogotá for the past three years.</p>
<p>“When you meet Colombians, you don't see 40 or 50 years of civil war,” he says. “You see happy, gregarious, smart, hard-working, dedicated people. That's the Colombia I live in.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Bacteria breeding grounds Keyboards five times dirtier than average toilet seat</b>
</div><div>Carmela Fragomeni The Hamilton Spectator  </div>
<div>676 words</div><div>16 July 2010</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>MET</div><div>GO05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>It may be time to develop computer hygiene to prevent germ-infested keyboards from making you sick.</p>
<p>Several studies have shown keyboards to be dirtier than the average toilet seat.</p>
<p>The problem is aggravated when hospital staff share a computer keyboard or when numerous people use the same computer at the library or even at home.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, msnbc.com reported researchers even found food poisoning bacteria on keyboards.</p>
<p>A U.K. consumer organization study two years ago found keyboards five times dirtier than the average toilet seat. And tests at a Chicago hospital in 2005 found bacteria including VRE and MRSA living on the keys for 24 hours.</p>
<p>A December episode of Discovery Channel's Mythbusters found keyboards to be the fourth worst everyday item tested that was dirtier than toilet seats -- after kitchen sponges, money and light switches.</p>
<p>When Mythbusters had Berkeley University students perform tests, keyboards came in third worst.</p>
<p>People can buy silicone and other keyboard covers or moulded keyboards that are easily wiped clean. But Hamilton microbiologist Dr. Cheryl Main says the simplest way to avoid picking up bacteria from a keyboard is to wash your hands.</p>
<p>The same applies to other everyday items like cellphones and door knobs.</p>
<p>"Our hands are the single best way to transmit bacteria," she said. "You're limited on how clean you can get your keyboard, so more important is hand washing."</p>
<p>But Florida's Compucover president James Garrett said, "It just doesn't happen."</p>
<p>People don't wash their hands after using a keyboard and they never clean their keyboards, he says. His company, one of several selling keyboard covers, has 20 per cent of its customers in Canada, including hospitals and dental officers, he says.</p>
<p>Another option is to clean and disinfect your keyboard regularly, especially if it has multiple users.</p>
<p>Durham Region's Jacqueline Miller has a part-time business cleaning and disinfecting computers. She once spent four days doing that at a Burlington company. Business slowed during the recession although it picked up again with the prevalence of the H1N1 flu virus last fall, she says.</p>
<p>But she agrees hand hygiene is very important, and so is a thorough keyboard cleaning. Running disinfecting wipes over the keys once in while won't work.</p>
<p>"If there's any grime buildup, it (the disinfectant) won't go through," Miller said.</p>
<p>Similar concerns have been raised about cellphones.</p>
<p>British microbiologist and Manchester University professor Joanna Verran says cellphones carry more germs than doorknobs, the soles of shoes and toilet seats.</p>
<p>"Our phones are perfect for the breeding of these germs as they're often kept warm and cosy in our pockets, handbags and brief cases," she says.</p>
<p>Microbiologist Main, an infectious diseases specialist for Hamilton Health Sciences and associate McMaster University professor, suggested people should at least apply hand sanitizer after using keyboards -- "especially if you go to have lunch or a cup of coffee."</p>
<p>The most common way bacteria infects someone is when they rub their eyes, she says.</p>
<p>"Eyes are a good entry point for bacteria and viruses because it gets in so easily. It's probably the No. 1 way you get sick."</p>
<p>Michelle Baird, Hamilton public health infectious disease and control manager, says people should try not to put their hands to their faces, try not to eat at their computers. And if they are ill, they should call in sick.</p>
<p>She also suggests washing your hands before you eat.</p>
<p>In hospitals, infectious control staff should ensure keyboards are properly cleaned since they already have patients with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>Main says people should be careful with any items on which bacteria accumulates.</p>
<p>"You can prevent bacteria from getting into your body by being conscious of what you do with your hands," she said.</p>

<p>Remember the swine-flu scare? Well, that was nothing compared to Divorcitis.</p>
<p>Divorcitis is no trumped-up threat, but a real social virus spreading to a neighborhood, workplace and family near you. At least that's what new findings from a group of researchers at three influential U.S. universities say.</p>
<p>Which explains what many have already witnessed.</p>
<p>“In our family we do divorce,” an acquaintance said recently when discussing her own marital split and those of two siblings.</p>
<p>Or, as a married friend of mine reported: “Everyone in my circle of friends is getting a divorce. We're the only ones left who are still together. It makes me a little scared.”</p>
<p>Turns out she should be. It's not far-fetched to think of divorce as a social epidemic.</p>
<p>Published earlier this week, the research paper Social Network Effects on Divorce by Rose McDermott, political psychologist at Rhode Island's Brown University, and social scientists James Fowler of the University of California, San Diego and Nicholas Christakis of Harvard University, draws on data from a longitudinal study of thousands of people in Framingham, Mass.</p>
<p>Started in 1948, the continuing study's original purpose was to examine heart disease, but it has also yielded rich information about people's social networks because participants (as well as their offspring and friends) were surveyed at regular intervals. The data have been used to look at how the obesity epidemic has spread in the population, for example.</p>
<p>In 2007, Prof. McDermott, the lead author of the paper, decided to use the information to examine divorce. She, too, had seen the divorce bug spread among her group of friends. “I believed that what we found would be there,” she says.</p>
<p>And serious contagion they found. They even identified “divorce clusters.”</p>
<p>People with a friend who had divorced were 147 per cent more likely to be divorced themselves by the time of their next examination, four years later.</p>
<p>People with a divorced sibling were 22 per cent more likely to divorce in the same time frame than those without a divorced sibling.</p>
<p>People with a divorced co-worker were 55 per cent more likely to divorce by the next survey than those with a non-divorced co-worker.</p>
<p>Makes you think about who you want sitting on the other side of the cubicle wall, doesn't it?</p>
<p>And get this: Among your network of friends, you don't even have to get divorced to pass along the virus. You can be a carrier.</p>
<p>“If you know someone who gets divorced, it might change your attitude as to whether it's acceptable, which you may then transmit to other friends who may not know the first person,” explains Prof. Fowler, who is also co-author with Prof. Christakis of the book Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives. “This is really about norms. Social networks influence virtually everything about love, sex and relationships.”</p>
<p>They have “such a strong effect that not only do we copy our friends, but we end up copying our friends' friends and even our friends' friends' friends,” Prof. Fowler explains. “If I don't know anything about you but I know your friend's friend has gotten divorced, I can be good at predicting whether you will get divorced.”</p>
<p>The researchers dismissed other possible explanations for the “divorce clusters” such as similarly minded people hanging out together, or some external event that might influence a mass divorce rate.</p>
<p>That the discussion about divorce is no longer taboo, as it was several generations ago, encourages infection rates.</p>
<p>“It gives permission and it's also instructive,” Prof. McDermott postulates. “You see that it's socially acceptable for people you know to divorce. And you look at them and think: ‘Divorce is hard. But you can survive it. If they can do it, so can I.' ”</p>
<p>The knowledge that a community of divorced, single friends awaits can also be encouraging.</p>
<p>“If you get divorced and think you'll be alone, you might be less likely to do it. But if you have divorced, single friends, that makes it easier because you have a network,” she adds.</p>
<p>Within families, it's not only siblings' divorces that can spark a breakup. Most potent is the divorce of a parent.</p>
<p>“If a parent gets divorced, it really increases the risk of getting divorced for the child,” Prof. McDermott points out. A recent example is the divorce announcement of former U.S. vice-president Al Gore and his wife of 40 years, Tipper. A few weeks later, their daughter's marriage was publicly on the rocks, too.</p>
<p>“We often want to do what our parents do,” Prof. McDermott says.</p>
<p>But there's a more subtle issue. “Patterns and dynamics of relationships are often emulated by a child in his or her own relationship,” she says. In addition, some social skills – such as knowing how to resolve conflict – are learned (or not) in families, which can influence how relationships are handled by the children.</p>
<p>So do you and your beloved spouse need to decamp to a desert island to avoid exposure to Divorcitis in your various social networks? Panic not. There's a possible antidote – aside from children, that is. (Researchers did find that the more children a couple has, the less susceptible they are to influence infection.) Still, asked if the divorce epidemic is to be feared, Prof. McDermott offers a resounding “No.”</p>
<p>“What [the findings] allow us to do is think about what effect the support of our friends' and family's relationships have on our own. Enlightened self-interest is not about self, it's about taking care of our community,” she says. “… [To] the extent to which you can [positively] feed your friends' relationships, you can feed your own.”</p>
<p>The vaccination, apparently, is all in the generosity of your heart.</p>

<p>VANCOUVER -- The Canadian Tourism Commission is expected to announce a significant shift in its operation Friday that will include staff changes and closing some international offices.</p>
<p>The makeover comes on the heels of a Global Tourism Watch report, released Thursday, that shows that out of the commission's 10 key international markets, only China delivered an increase in visitors to Canada in 2009.</p>
<p>CTC officials were tight-lipped Thursday, declining to reveal any details before the formal announcement.</p>
<p>However, two sources said Thursday the federal agency has decided to close down three of its international offices. The offices to be closed are in Australia, France and Germany, they said.</p>
<p>The commission is also laying off staff and shifting others into new positions, the sources said.</p>
<p>The federal agency, which was created in 1995, went through a major reorganization five years ago when its head office was moved to Vancouver from Ottawa. Only a handful of employees agreed to move out west, requiring the agency to fill several key executive positions and senior manager positions. The new management team reorganized the agency's operations at that time.</p>
<p>The commission is an agency within Industry Canada that works with the tourism industry and the federal, provincial and territorial governments to market Canada and undertake industry research.</p>
<p>“The federal government fully supports the commission as the country's national tourism marketing organization,” Michel Cimpaya, a media relations officer with Industry Canada, said earlier this week in an e-mail response to a request for an interview.</p>
<p>“We continue to invest in the CTC's marketing strategies as they help to grow tourism revenues for the Canadian economy,” he stated. “That means there is no change to the government relations with the CTC or its support,” he added.</p>
<p>A report by the commission's research department, called Global Tourism Watch, attributes the drop in tourism in Canada in 2009 to the global economic impact and the H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Tourism from China to Canada rose one per cent in 2009 but the tourism traffic from France and Germany dropped three per cent; from the U.K., 17 per cent.</p>
<p>Tourist arrivals in Canada from Australia tumbled by 14 per cent, from South Korea by 25 per cent and from Japan, 28 per cent.</p>
<p>The biggest drop was in tourism from Mexico, which fell 37 per cent.</p>
<p>The commission currently has international offices in Australia, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the U.S., Mexico, South Korea, Japan, Brazil, India and China.</p>
<p>The commission had a budget of $26-million for funding of Olympic-related projects.</p>
<p>Also, the federal government's special stimulus funding in 2009 included $20-million to market Canada over a two-year period to “priority and emerging international markets.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the commission launched a new training program for the travel industry.</p>

<p>Remember the swine-flu scare? Well, that was nothing compared to Divorcitis.</p>
<p>Even worse, Divorcitis is it’s not a trumped-up threat, but a real social virus spreading to a neighborhood, workplace and family near you. At least that’s what new findings say from a group of researchers at three influential U.S. universities say.</p>
<p>Which explains what many have //already// witnessed.</p>
<p>“In our family, we do divorce,” an acquaintance said a woman said recently, when discussing her own marital split and those of two siblings.</p>
<p>Or, as a married friend of mine reported:, “Everyone in my circle of friends is getting a divorce. We’re the only ones left who are still together. It makes me a little scared.”</p>
<p>Turns out she should be. It’s not far-fetched to think of divorce as a social epidemic.</p>
<p>Published earlier this week, the research paper Social Network Effects on Divorce by Rose McDermott, political psychologist at Rhode Island’s Brown University, and social scientists, James Fowler of the University of //California,// San Diego and Nicholas Christakis of Harvard University, draws on data from a longitudinal, observational study of thousands of people in Framingham, Mass.</p>
<p>Started in 1948, the continuing ongoing study’s original purpose was to examine heart disease, and risk but it has also yielded rich information about people’s social networks because as participants (as well as their offspring and friends) were surveyed at regular intervals. The data have has been used to look at how the obesity epidemic has spread spreads in the population, for example.</p>
<p>In 2007, Prof. McDermott, the lead author of the paper, decided to use the information to examine divorce. She, too, had seen the divorce bug spread among her group of friends. “I believed that what we found would be there,” she says.</p>
<p>And serious contagion they found. They even identified “divorce clusters.”</p>
<p>People with a friend who had got divorced were 147 per cent more likely to be divorced themselves by the time of their next examination, four years later.</p>
<p>People with a divorced sibling were 22 per cent more likely to divorce get divorced in the same time frame than those without a divorced sibling.</p>
<p>People with a divorced co-worker were 55 per cent more likely to get divorced by the next survey than those with a non-divorced co-worker.</p>
<p>Makes you think about who you want sitting on the other side of the cubicle wall, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>And get this: Among your network of friends, you don’t even have to get divorced to pass along the virus. You can be a carrier.</p>
<p>“If you know someone who gets divorced, it might change your attitude as to whether it’s acceptable, which you may then transmit to other friends who may not know the first person,” explains Prof. Fowler, who is also co-author with Prof. Christakis of the book Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives. “This is really about norms.

A recent example is the divorce announcement of former U.S. Democratic vice-president Al Gore and his wife of 40 years, Tipper. A few weeks later, their daughter’s marriage was publicly on the rocks, too.</p>
<p>The parent-child connection is an outcome of modeling behaviour. “We often want to do what our parents do,” Prof. McDermott says.</p>
<p>But there’s a more subtle issue. “Patterns and dynamics of relationships are often emulated by a child in his or her own relationship,” she says. In addition, some social skills – such as knowing how to resolve conflict – are learned (or not) in families, which can influence how relationships are handled by the children.</p>

</p>
<p>After months of warnings that the death rate could rise at some of B.C.'s busiest hospitals, emergency-room physicians have reached a deal with the province to increase the number of doctors, the government announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>There will be an increase in doctors in 19 emergency rooms across the province, Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon and Dr. Ian Gillespie, president of the B.C. Medical Association, said in a joint announcement.</p>
<p>The province will spend $146 million over two years for physician services in these hospitals, $12 million more than the previous agreement.</p>
<p>The deal follows an aggressive public campaign by the emergency-room doctors at several hospitals, including Vancouver General, who warned that "near misses" were on the rise and mortality rates could increase because waiting times for patients to see a physician are too high.</p>
<p>The physicians have been without a contract since last spring.</p>
<p>"We're pleased to have reached an agreement with these emergency-room physicians that will bring more doctors and more services to some of the province's busiest hospitals," said Falcon.</p>
<p>Gillespie said the BCMA is pleased hospitals will get the resources necessary to alleviate the pressure found in the high-volume emergency departments around B.C.</p>
<p>Half of the money will go toward 10.6 full-time equivalent positions to meet demand, the government said. The hospital will decide how to allocate those positions. For example, they may decide to hire a new doctor or give someone who is working part time more shifts.</p>
<p>The remaining funds will go to providing up to 17,800 hours of service each year. The government said the funds will allow the BCMA more flexibility to allocate extra hours for hospitals during busier times, such as when the H1N1 outbreak hit last year and ER visits increased significantly.</p>
<p>Full-time equivalent positions vary among the 19 hospitals, depending on how crowded the emergency room.</p>
<p>The hours allocated for Vancouver General Hospital, which received the largest increase, for instance, will go up to 27.78 from 22.60, or the equivalent of about five extra doctors, while St. Paul's Hospital and UBC will see the equivalent of about one more doctor.</p>
<p>Calculations for the new full-time equivalent positions include the additional 17,800 hours.</p>
<p>Not all of the hospitals, however, received an increase in doctors.</p>
<p>The East Kootenay Regional Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital saw a decrease, while the University Hospital of Northern B.C. and Saanich Peninsula Hospital will stay the same.</p>
<p>The funding will be given to 19 hospitals where physicians are paid through a contract instead of a fee-for-service model. The contracted doctors draw a salary as opposed to billing the province per service.</p>
<p>Doctors working in other B.C. emergency departments are not impacted by the agreement. Dr. Shelley Ross, on the executive board of the BCMA, said doctor salaries will not increase.</p>

</p>
<p>(From Edmonton Journal, July 15, 2010) Michael Cunningham of Edmonton had contracted the H1N1 virus before he underwent a double-lung transplant. The virus was not present in the new lungs before the procedure. A story on A5 in Wednesday's paper contained misleading information. ***** </p>
<p>Surgeons transplanting two new lungs in a life-saving operation on an Edmonton man faced an unprecedented complication last fall when they discovered the organs they had just transferred were infected with the H1N1 flu virus, a report has revealed.</p>
<p>Michael Cunningham appears to be the first double-lung transplant patient in the world to have contracted the pandemic virus as he underwent the complex procedure, his doctors say.</p>
<p>Patients with underlying breathing problems face the greatest risk from the swine flu, and the infection presented a major challenge for the medical team.</p>
<p>Transplant patients are pumped full of drugs to actually suppress their immune systems. Designed to ease acceptance of someone else's organs, the medication made fighting a potentially deadly flu that much more dicey.</p>
<p>"It's a really unique case," said Dr. Mohammed Al-Aklabi, a University of Alberta surgeon and lead author of a paper just published on the case. "Patients who are already sick with other problems and get H1N1, they are at higher risk of dying."</p>
<p>Cunningham said his reaction was "holy cow" when he learned he had the new flu. An aggressive course of anti-viral drugs beat back the infection and helped contribute to a full recovery.</p>

</div><div>SHANNON PROUDFOOT   </div>
<div>Postmedia News</div>
<div>468 words</div><div>14 July 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>A coalition of influential organizations and individuals called on the Conservatives yesterday to reverse a decision to axe the long-form census, warning the move will hobble governments, cities and private businesses, waste money and leave Canada struggling to compete.</p>
<p>"The information derived from the census long-form questionnaire is the backbone of an information society that needs and wants to know about itself," Armine Yalnizyan, senior economist at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives, said at a news conference in Toronto.</p>
<p>She was joined at the event by representatives from the Canadian Association of Business Economists, the Canadian Institute of Planners, United Way Toronto, the Canadian Association of University Teachers, the Ontario Council of Agencies Serving Immigrants and others who decried the government's decision.</p>
<p>The group is drafting a letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Industry Minister Tony Clement, who oversees Statistics Canada, urging them to reverse the decision and open the issue to consultation.</p>
<p>If reliable local demographic information isn't available, businesses and organizations will simply be guessing about where to allocate resources, Yalnizyan said, and they'll end up wasting money as a result.</p>
<p>"Without this information, we are all punching in the dark," she said.</p>
<p>Mel Cappe, president of the Institute for Research on Public Policy and formerly Canada's top public servant as clerk of the Privy Council, said the government is right that the census is coercive, but like other "obligations of citizenship" such as jury duty, obeying stop signs and filling out passport forms, it's necessary.</p>
<p>"Those are all coercions of the state, and every five years for 20 per cent of the population to be coerced to spend 20 minutes to fill out the long form does not offend me," he said. "Someone had to make a judgment about that freedom, and the prime minister has come to a judgment on it and I hope he's open to being convinced that he should change that judgment."</p>
<p>Carol Timmings, director of planning and policy at Toronto Public Health, likened doing public health work in any Canadian city without robust demographic data to assisting a surgeon in the operating room with the lights turned out.</p>
<p>"In the H1N1 pandemic, if we had not had access to this information, we could not possibly have understood the priority populations that were most at risk for a pandemic," Timmings said.</p>
<p>Don Drummond, former chief economist for TD Bank and a member of the National Statistics Council, Statistics Canada's national advisory body, said these changes to the 2011 census will leave Canada "in a fog" for years to come.</p>
<p>In a statement yesterday, Clement said he stood by the decision.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tories to review health bonuses; Stelmach says new model necessary</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>944 words</div><div>13 July 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>P remier Ed Stelmach says his government will review the structure that pays lucrative bonuses to health superboard executives -- arguing "a different model is necessary" -- but won't reopen current contracts.</p>
<p>His pledge is being met with skepticism, though, as opposition parties declared it empty rhetoric, while Stelmach's spending czar defended the pay model as necessary to attract top talent to the public sector.</p>
<p>The Tories and Alberta Health Services have drawn fire for the hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses paid to superboard brass last fiscal year, as the agency ran an $885-million deficit and failed to meet targets for improving health-care access and quality.</p>
<p>"It's a time where we have to look at a different model to reimburse CEOs, especially of public authorities," Stelmach told reporters at his annual Stampede breakfast at the McDougall Centre.</p>
<p>"I've asked the minister just to review and come back to me personally to see how we can do this diff erently."</p>
<p>The premier's call for a review of health executive bonuses comes less than a week after AHS released financial statements for the 2009-10 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett was paid $149,000 in bonuses and other benefits.</p>
<p>He collected $744,000 in total compensation, during a year in which wait lists grew, the superboard ran a large deficit and fumbled its H1N1 vaccination rollout.</p>
<p>Duckett was paid $595,000 in base salary, as well as $139,000 in other cash benefits (including bonuses, overtime and vacation payouts), and $10,000 in non-cash benefits that included pension contributions.</p>
<p>He was eligible for a bonus of 25 per cent of his salary -- or $143,750 in direct bonus pay -- and eventually received $76,619, or 53 per cent of it, based on meeting about half of his set targets.</p>
<p>David Eggen with Friends of Medicare said health executives already receive a large base salary and should not have exorbitant bonuses written into their contracts.</p>
<p>"There should be a diffe-ent pay structure that doesn't include grotesque bonuses," Eggen said. "I hope the premier has some sense to act on this."</p>
<p>But while about 6,000 other government managers will forgo bonuses again this fiscal year, the premier said he won't renege on any contracts with health-care executives.</p>
<p>"A contract is a contract. Whatever the agreement was, we're past this year," Stelmach added.</p>
<p>More than a half-dozen health vice-presidents received bonuses ranging from about $26,000 to $82,000, for reaching 64 per cent to 71 per cent of their targets. The bonuses are approved by the AHS board.</p>
<p>All told, Duckett and more than a dozen other executives were paid $5.8 million in salary, bonuses and benefits in the 2009-10 fiscal year.</p>
<p>Tory MLA Fred Horne, who's leading provincewide consultations on proposed changes to health legislation, said he's received an earful on AHS compensation, even though it's not part of his committee's mandate.</p>
<p>"A number of people have raised the issue," said Horne. "In some cases, they perceive a disconnect between the bonuses that have been recently announced and progress on issues in their local community."</p>
<p>Yet, Treasury Board president Lloyd Snelgrove cautioned Albertans against overreacting to the bonuses, stressing the province must pay fair wages to attract talent to the health system.</p>
<p>"If we want to have the best health-care system -- and Albertans do -- it costs us to have that. Good management costs money," Snelgrove said.</p>
<p>He also noted the province is reviewing the number of bosses in the public service, as it hopes to find the "appropriate management structure" and relax the hiring freeze on front-line staff.</p>
<p>With new communication tools and improved efficiency at the management level, "it would seem that you can do more with less people," he said. "It's about being flexible and making sure that you have the right number of people in the right spot."</p>
<p>At AHS, seven vice-presidents and senior officials received total compensation of $400,000 or more last year, including the vice-president of quality and service improvement snaring $812,000 in base salary, cash benefits and other non-cash benefits.</p>
<p>Opposition critics assailed the health board and premier for allowing bonuses to be paid out during a year in which AHS admittedly failed to reach its targets for improving access and quality of care.</p>
<p>"He (Stelmach) has done nothing up to this point. I don't think we should expect much out of this," said NDP house leader Rachel Notley.</p>
<p>The health board achieved, however, at least $500 million in annualized cost savings, including reducing executive compensation by $12.4 million by slashing the number of vice-presidents from 144 under the former regions to 79 today.</p>
<p>Dr. Tom Noseworthy, a health policy expert at the University of Calgary, said Duckett's total compensation is fair considering he's responsible for an $11-billion organization with 90,000 staff.</p>
<p>Also, AHS's new performance-based bonus structure is a responsible approach to rewarding senior health executives and far better than the framework under the former health regions, he said.</p>
<p>"It's a huge step forward to the snouts in the trough before Alberta Health Services," Noseworthy said. "This is an example of the (health) board doing something reasonable."</p>

<p>Anticipation was high yesterday for Fidel Castro's interview on Cuban television, a rare occurrence since the former Cuban leader became a shut-in about four years ago. What would he say? Would he appear healthy? What colour of co-ordinated leisure suit would he wear?</p>
<p>The answer to the first question was simple. Judging by Fidel's frequent editorials, which have appeared in state-run media since the 83-year-old handed power (nudge, wink) to brother Raul in 2006, he would say whatever pops into his bearded head.</p>
<p>Health-care reform? Elections in Latin America? The World Baseball Classic? No subject is off limits for the former dictator's meandering thoughts, which are called "Reflections by comrade Fidel," although they would be more accurately titled "Streams of Consciousness" by comrade Fidel.</p>
<p>Mr. Castro's writings are best suited to one of those bullet-point-style columns ( "It is only a matter of time until the Yankee imperialists crumble ... You can't beat a chicken sandwich and a glass of iced tea on a hot day") but he has eschewed such conventions and instead veers from topic to topic in the same Reflection, from the weighty to the banal.</p>
<p>Usually his observations come to a thudding end, although sometimes he employs a sign-off, as with this gem from last year: "I have nothing else to say today." (Admittedly, this is a device I have considered when struggling to find an end to a column.)</p>
<p>Take this example from last January, after Mr. Castro met with the Argentine President, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner. Headlined "Meeting Cristina," the editorial noted "she was presented with a doctor's white coat, which she immediately put on the orange jacket and slacks she was wearing."</p>
<p>He then summed her up this way: "Cristina is a devoted President who likes to work on a full-time basis. However, when she travels to other countries, she protects her right to have a number of hours to adapt and to exercise; and this everyone respects." Yes, she is admired the world over for her commitment to getting in a little time on the stairclimber.</p>
<p>It's not unexpected that Mr. Castro has devoted much of his writing to blasting the United States and its allies ( "Seven Daggers at the Heart of the Americas"), but he also reserves a considerable amount of space for, well, crazy talk.</p>
<p>First he suspected the H1N1 virus was developed by the CIA, then he decided it wasn't but that Mexico deliberately hid its existence until after Barack Obama visited that country in the spring of 2009.</p>
<p>He thought the 2009 World Baseball Classic was rigged to allow the United States to avoid playing the best teams until late in the tournament. (Fidel was oddly fixated on that sporting event, which he portrayed as a clash between Asian industriousness and work ethic, Cuban moral superiority and American sloth and excess.)</p>
<p>Most recently, he has taken to reflecting upon the unavoidability of Armageddon, in the form of a nuclear clash between Israel and Iran, or the United States and North Korea, or maybe a little from Column A and a little from Column B.</p>
<p>One of his most doomsaying entries, rather plaintively titled "I Would So Much Like to Be Wrong," includes this bit of geopolitical analysis:</p>
<p>"I initially thought ... that the conflict would start at the Korean peninsula, where the second Korean War would break out, and that another war would immediately follow; the one that the United States would impose on Iran. Now, we are witnessing a different turn of events: the war in Iran will immediately spark off that of Korea."</p>
<p>He understands, though, that most people are not paying attention to the impending End of the World:</p>
<p>"It is only fair that football fans freely enjoy the competitions of this World Cup. I simply fulfill my duty of informing our people, as I think mostly of our youths, full of life and hope, especially our wonderful children, so that the developments do not catch them by surprise."</p>
<p>In fact, for much of the past six weeks Mr. Castro has written only about the coming nuclear standoff, with occasional toe-dipping into the pool of soccer analysis.</p>
<p>Here he is on July 4, zinging the United States on its birthday: "The empire is about to make an irreparable mistake and nothing can stop it. It walks inexorably towards a sinister fate."</p>
<p>Then, the very next paragraph after that bold assertion of doom:</p>
<p>"The only thing sure now is that the Football World Cup had its quarterfinals. Thus, the fans of that sport could enjoy the exciting matches where we saw incredible things happen. It is said that the Netherlands team had not lost a World Cup match on a Friday, in 36 years. Only computers could make it possible to register such an event."</p>
<p>Computers: Aren't they the best?</p>
<p>That July 4 reflection was actually a climbdown from a week earlier, when Mr. Castro asserted that President Obama had promised to attend the World Cup on July 2 only because he knew "better than anyone that the quarterfinals will not be contested because very serious developments will take place before that."</p>
<p>But while he did predict that war would stop the World Cup, he was unwilling to predict how a nuclear catastrophe would impact our ecosystem.</p>
<p>"We don't know which will be the effect on the environment of the nuclear weapons that will unavoidably explode in various parts of the world, and that in the least serious variant will happen in abundance," he wrote on June 27. "To advance a hypothesis would be pure science fiction."</p>
<p>I have nothing else to say today.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health boss hands out staff bonuses worth up to $500</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>695 words</div><div>10 July 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>As backlash mounted Friday over lucrative bonuses paid to Alberta Health Services executives, the superboard's CEO announced he will personally pay out six cash awards between $250 and $500 to employees for innovative ideas.</p>
<p>Opposition critics charged the front-line employees are being offered a pittance for ideas that earned big bosses eye-popping bonuses.</p>
<p>The government's political opponents also demanded that AHS executive bonuses be scrapped; stunned that hundreds of thousands of dollars in financial rewards could be paid out for the past fiscal year when the super-board bled red ink and missed many of its targets.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services chief executive Stephen Duckett -- who received $149,000 in bonuses and other benefits -- had launched an "Action Your Ideas" initiative that encouraged AHS employees to submit their thoughts on how to find operational efficiencies and cost savings.</p>
<p>He disclosed Friday on his blog that six unnamed ideas have been picked out of 700 submissions from staff and physicians, with the awards ranging from $250 to $500.</p>
<p>"It was about creating an opportunity to demonstrate that ideas from all parts of our organization are valued and important. So it was always much more than just a contest," Duckett posted on his blog.</p>
<p>"The submissions show real understanding of the complexities of health care and pride in your work. I enjoyed learning more about how things work 'on the ground' and hearing in your own words a sense of commitment to care," he added.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, efficiency and cost-saving are freeing resources to improve quality and patient care. After many weeks of focus on the budget, I found this personally very rewarding and inspiring. Thank-you."</p>
<p>But opposition parties are wondering if the cost savings are simply being used to help pay out the hundreds of thousands of dollars in bonuses for superboard executives.</p>
<p>All told, Duckett and more than a dozen other executives were paid $5.8 million in salary, bonuses and benefits in the 2009-10 fiscal year, according to newly released financial statements.</p>
<p>Duckett collected $744,000 in total compensation, during a year in which wait lists grew, the superboard ran an $885-million deficit and fumbled its H1N1 vaccination rollout.</p>
<p>He was paid $595,000 in base salary, as well as $139,000 in other cash benefits (including bonuses, overtime and vacation payouts), and $10,000 in non-cash benefits that included contributions to a pension plan.</p>
<p>"It's an insult to people's intelligence to hand out $250 to an employee who's giving him an idea that helps him get a bonus (and cash benefits) of $139,000," said Liberal health critic Kevin Taft.</p>
<p>Paul Hinman, Wildrose MLA for Calgary-Glenmore, said AHS bonuses reflect the organization is bloated with too many managers, and is "out of touch" with current economic realities.</p>
<p>Duckett was eligible for a bonus of about 25 per cent of his salary -- or $143,750 in direct bonus pay -- and eventually received $76,619, or 53 per cent of it, based on meeting about half of his set targets.</p>
<p>More than a half-dozen other vice-presidents received bonuses ranging between about $26,000 and $82,000, for reaching about 64 per cent to 71 per cent of their targets.</p>
<p>Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky said the public will be satisfied -- and accepting of bonuses -- as long as the system is improving.</p>
<p>The health board achieved, however, at least $500 million in annualized cost savings, including reducing executive compensation by $12.4 million by slashing the number of vice-presidents from 144 under the former regions to 79 today.</p>
<p>In a statement provided to the Herald, board vice-chair Catherine Roozen said the new bonus system (dubbed pay-at-risk) is based solely on meeting performance targets and is much more transparent than the ad hoc one in place under the former regional health authorities.</p>
<p>She also noted executive compensation was set at the national average.</p>

</p>
<p>A lberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett collected $744,000 in total compensation last fiscal year -- including $149,000 in bonuses and other benefits -- during a year some wait lists grew and the superboard ran an $885-million deficit.</p>
<p>The release Thursday of AHS's financial statements for the 2009-10 fiscal year reveals about a dozen vice-presidents and other senior executives also received annual compensation each in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<p>Health organizations and opposition parties said the bonuses paid to Duckett and his senior brass are exorbitant for an organization that can't balance its books and hasn't seen improvement on certain wait times and surgery queues.</p>
<p>Duckett was paid $595,000 in base salary, as well as $139,000 in other cash benefits (including bonuses, overtime and vacation payouts), and $10,000 in non-cash benefits that included contributions to a pension plan.</p>
<p>The superboard CEO was eligible for a bonus of about 25 per cent of his salary -- or $143,750 in direct bonus pay (dubbed pay-at-risk because it's contingent upon meeting performance targets).</p>
<p>He eventually received $76,619, or 53 per cent of it, based on meeting about half of his set targets -- but fell well short on improving access to the system.</p>
<p>The final bonus amount is determined by the AHS board.</p>
<p>"There's still some work to do. By and large, his performance has been satisfactory," said Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky.</p>
<p>" The board felt this was fair and adequate compensation."</p>
<p>To receive the bonus, Duckett and AHS must reach certain targets, such as reducing the number of patients waiting for hospital beds in the community and reducing emergency waiting times.</p>
<p>On the health board's goals of improving access and wait times (which is weighted for 40 per cent of his bonus), he received only 3.3 per cent.</p>
<p>The superboard failed to open as many acute-care beds as originally planned and didn't hit its targets for reducing wait times in emergency departments and for hip replacement surgeries.</p>
<p>Duckett was awarded 20 out of a possible 30 per cent of his bonus for improving quality of care, including meeting targets for developing an incident report system and establishing health advisory councils.</p>
<p>And on the sustainability side (which is contingent upon hitting budget targets, among others), he received 30 out of 30.</p>
<p>"Albertans are rightly outraged at some of the bonuses that are handed out in spite of the chaos that now exists in our health-care system," said Liberal Leader David Swann, a medical doctor.</p>
<p>There's no reason to be forking out bonuses to health executives who are simply doing their job, and a poor one at that, Swann said.</p>
<p>More than a half-dozen other vice-presidents received bonuses, ranging between about $26,000 and $82,000, for reaching about 64 per cent to 71 per cent of their targets.</p>
<p>Seven other vice-presidents and senior officials received total compensation of $400,000 or more last year, including the VP of quality and service improvement snaring $812,000 in base salary, cash benefits and other non-cash benefits.</p>
<p>AHS board chairman Ken Hughes and other board members weren't available for comment.</p>
<p>Health-care professionals and opposition critics said myriad problems in the health system over the last year should have made it nearly impossible for executives to earn a bonus.</p>
<p>Beyond AHS failing to meet many of its own targets, the agency ran a $885-million deficit last year.</p>
<p>Wait lists for long-term care have grown compared with two years ago, according to recent data.</p>
<p>Furthermore, access to cancer doctors and facilities has been at crisis levels in Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p>"How you get a bonus out of that kind of performance is beyond me," said the NDP's Rachel Notley.</p>
<p>Heather Smith, president of the United Nurses of Alberta, said many of her members would argue Duckett doesn't deserve much of a bonus -- if any.</p>
<p>Smith said the health board CEO has alienated nurses during his tenure and was responsible for many "covert layoffs" over the last year by not filling vacant positions.</p>
<p>Other notable findings from the AHS financial statements:</p>
<p>-Total costs to fight the H1N1 influenza outbreak were $58.7 million last fiscal year;</p>
<p>-AHS is named as a defendant in 379 legal claims totalling at least $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, contracts for a previously announced cataract surgery blitz were unveiled by Zwozdesky on Thursday.</p>
<p>In May, the ministry said it would pump $2 million to fund 1,400 additional cataract surgeries.</p>
<p>Ophthalmologists said they were pleased by the announcement, which is expected to reduce a one-year wait-list for the procedure.</p>
<p>The contracts will enable additional clinics to perform the surgery. Five non-hospital facilities have been approved in Calgary.</p>

<p>It is with great irony that on the day that 80 new Canadians receive their citizenship, the government announces funding cuts for the English Express, cancelling a valuable tool to help immigrants integrate into our Canadian society.</p>
<p>I am a Grade 4 teacher in Millwoods. Ten out of 25 of my students this past school year were new to Canada or new Canadians. Our school has a total of 241 different cultures represented.</p>
<p>The newspaper was used for reading in the class, but was also a source of information for explaining the electoral process, how to file taxes, how to make a dental or doctor's appointment; it explained the H1N1 flu, its symptoms and what to do about them.

<p>After using the paper in class, the students took it home to share with their brothers and sisters and to read to their parents. Children learn English much more quickly than their parents do and the parents rely on their children for information about how this new society operates.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Public Health looks back at H1N1 virus Only 30 per cent in region vaccinated for H1N1, but fewer contracted serious illness</b>
</div><div>By Johanna Weidner   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>445 words</div><div>9 July 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Fewer people got vaccinated for H1N1 than expected in the region, but fewer people got seriously ill.</p>
<p>Just under 30 per cent of Waterloo Region residents were vaccinated for the flu strain last year, while there were only 33 H1N1-related hospitalizations and no confirmed deaths, according to recently released annual report from Region of Waterloo Public Health.</p>
<p>"Overall, I'm pleased," said regional medical officer of health Dr. Liana Nolan.</p>
<p>Public Health will present an in-depth report to the regional community services committee in August, detailing how they did and what could be done better.</p>
<p>"You always learn something with every event," Nolan said.</p>
<p>Although a big problem with the campaign was out of Public Health's control. The supply of vaccines from the province was slow and spotty at the beginning and just couldn't meet the demand.</p>
<p>"We just weren't able to get enough vaccine at the time people wanted it the most," Nolan said. "By the time we had enough vaccine to immunize everybody, interest had waned."</p>
<p>The first public immunization clinics were swamped, leading the region to limit vaccinations to high risk groups in the beginning and implementing a wristband system to manage the long waits.</p>
<p>The region reported a 29.3 per cent vaccination rate, similar to other jurisdictions in the province but a far cry from the rate of almost 50 per cent for the regular seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"I'm actually surprised by the number in the end," Nolan said.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the H1N1 virus caused far less serious illness and death than predicted or planned for in the worst-case scenarios when the outbreak began last April and the virus spread quickly around the world. Most cases locally were between May and November.</p>
<p>Deaths were kept low partly because the virus affected mostly younger people, while the seasonal flu affects the elderly, who are at greater risk of serious complications from existing health conditions.</p>
<p>Most cases were mild and the majority of people recovered at home.</p>
<p>"It just wasn't as virulent a virus," Nolan said.</p>
<p>33 H1N1-related hospitalizations</p>
<p>32 community immunization clinics</p>
<p>38,500 immunizations administered at community clinics</p>
<p>113,500 immunizations distributed to primary care providers</p>
<p>6,892 phone calls to the H1N1 general information line</p>
<p>116,010 visits to the region's pandemic website</p>
<p>224 visits to assessment centres</p>
<p>29.3 % immunization rate</p>

<div id="hd"><b>B.C. deficit $1 billion less than projected; After a year of cuts, province won't loosen purse strings, Hansen says</b>
</div><div>Rob Shaw   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>1074 words</div><div>9 July 2010</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>A year of deep cuts to B.C. government programs and services has resulted in a deficit that's almost $1 billion less than expected, Finance Minister Colin Hansen said yesterday. But that doesn't mean there's more money to spend, or that the government will return to balanced budgets any faster, he warned.</p>
<p>The province ran a deficit of $1.779 billion in the fiscal year that ended March 31, say public accounts statements; the forecast, made in September, was for $2.775 billion.</p>
<p>Hansen said the reduction is primarily due to less spending. Provincial revenue, including personal and corporate income tax and natural resource royalties, continued to slump. But the government cut $833 million in spending through internal belt-tightening, said Hansen. That included layoff notices to 772 civil servants, and cuts to discretionary, administrative and travel spending in virtually every government ministry.</p>
<p>Hansen said the cuts were so effective -- for example, travel budgets fell 50 per cent, instead of a targeted 22 per cent -- that the government exceeded its goals.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, lesser-priority items will still have to be cut to fund future projects, said Hansen. "We do not anticipate that we're going to have fiscal room in these next few years to expand new programs unless there are savings found elsewhere across the fiscal plan."</p>
<p>Hansen dismissed suggestions that government restore the funding it cut from programs and services, including grants to non-profit arts, sports and theatre groups. Nor will it reverse cuts to community mental health programs and addiction services.</p>
<p>That refusal will lead to long-term costs in other parts of the health-care system, said Jennifer Charlesworth, executive director of the Federation of Community Social Services of B.C. "That's, for me, a bitter pill," she said. "None of us want to have a province that's got big deficits and is crippled financially ... but it gets [down] to making smart decisions on what to cut."</p>
<p>While overall economic growth remained sluggish, Hansen said the province remains on track for a</p>
<p>$1.7-billion deficit this year, which it forecast in March. The government says it can return to balanced budgets by 2013-14.</p>
<p>"We are still not projecting we are going to be out of deficit any sooner than we were projecting a year ago," said Hansen. The smaller deficit simply means "we have slightly less debt in the province to pass on to the next generation."</p>
<p>Overall, the B.C. economy is recovering modestly as expected, said Helmut Pastrick, chief economist for <span class="companylink">Central 1 Credit Union</span> and a member of the government's forecast council. "The assumptions that the government used on their revenue side, economic assumptions, seemed to be prudent and conservative at the time and I think for the most part they've held up," he said.</p>
<p>Opposition NDP finance critic Bruce Ralston said the revised deficit numbers are another example of broken Liberal promises.</p>
<p>The B.C. Liberals had pledged to run only a $495-million deficit during the 2009 spring election campaign. But after winning re-election, they revised the deficit to $2.8 billion in a September budget update. The fact it's now almost $1.8 billion is not as important as the fact the deficit is four times what was promised in last year's election, Ralston said.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Carole James has said an NDP government would run deficits for more years than the Liberals so that fewer programs and services would have to be cut.</p>
<p>The government plans to release this year's first quarterly report by mid-September.</p>
<p>rfshaw@tc.canwest.com</p>
<p>CREDIT CARD PURCHASES</p>
<p>The B.C. government released a list of credit card purchases made by employees and ministries in 2009/10 as part of public accounts yesterday. Among the highlights:</p>
<p>- $20,691.20 from the Ministry of Attorney General to Klassic European Grocery for "lunches provided to prisoners."</p>
<p>- $2,585.80 to Quail's Gate Estate Winery for the Canadian Council of Chief Judges spring seminar. (Quail's Gate is owned by the family of Liberal cabinet minister Ben Stewart.)</p>
<p>- $1,045.77 from the Ministry of Education to Bytes and Grins (an online educational gift store) for "staff recognition gifts."</p>
<p>- $277 by the Ministry of Children and Family Development to "Friendfinder" (an online dating website). The ministry says the credit card was stolen and the payment was disputed.</p>
<p>- $12,054.60 to the Giftcard Boutique website for "recruitment incentive and employee perfect attendance programs" in the Ministry of Public Safety and Solicitor General.</p>
<p>- $2,466.07 for metal detectors for the North Coast.</p>
<p>- $2,174.02 for five licenses to <span class="companylink">Google</span> Earth Pro.</p>

<p>- $200 in "staff recognition gifts" to The Keg Steakhouse & Bar on Fort Street in Victoria for the Transportation Ministry.</p>
<p>- $2,226.68 for hand sanitizers and pumps at various government facilities.</p>
<p>- $29,433.31 in video-game systems for B.C. Corrections inmates, which the solicitor general's ministry said was reimbursed by an Inmate Benefit Fund.</p>
<p>- $498.56 to Lululemon for "ministry-wide healthy workplace activities" in the Ministry of Healthy Living and Sport.</p>
<p>- $198.61 to Joe the Bartender (a Victoria business) for a snow-cone rental machine for public service week.</p>
<p>- $7,293.12 to RV Days (an Okanagan holiday trailer rental company) for "emergency crew accommodation during the Summerland Iron Man Triathlon."</p>
<p>- $51.48 to The Pig Site website for books on the swine industry.</p>

<p>The government also released a list of marketing and publication expenses, highlights of which included:</p>
<p>- $36.67 million for the Tourism B.C. "You Gotta Be Here" marketing campaign, in which prominent B.C. celebrities such as Michael J. Fox and Ryan Reynolds described the beauty of the province through advertisements.</p>
<p>- Approximately $2 million for H1N1 radio, TV, print and online advertising.</p>
<p>- Approximately $500,000 for radio ads about forest fire prevention.</p>
<p>- Approximately $124,000 for recruitment advertising for job opportunities in the B.C. Public Service Agency.</p>
<p>- $273,848 to inform people about the programs, services and job opportunities at the Officers of the Legislature (including the privacy commissioner, children's representative, police complaints commissioner, Elections B.C., etc.)</p>

<p>Parastoo Yaghmaee holds out a bag of dried pineapple, so I say thanks and take out a couple of chunks.</p>
<p>It's dry and crunchy. I pop it in my mouth. It's tart, sweet and aromatic, indistinguishable in flavour from fresh pineapple.</p>
<p>On the same display table as the pineapple are bags of pinkish cantaloupe, fire red chilies, forest green brussels sprouts, beige bananas and more than a dozen other dried foods including fish and shrimp.</p>
<p>The foods have a few things in common. They are in their pure form -- free of additives, colouring agents and preservatives, they retain most of their original nutrition and colour -- and they were all produced in a research laboratory at the University of British Columbia using a leading-edge dehydration technology that its developers hope will turn the processing of food, food ingredients, and even vaccines and antibiotics on its ear.</p>
<p>Yaghmaee, who has a doctorate in food science, and her boss Tim Durance have been fine-tuning the technology for more than a decade, taking it from the realm of theory to practical science and engineering.</p>
<p>A company formed around the science, <span class="companylink">EnWave Corp</span>., has sold one dehydrator to a local blueberry producer and is collaborating with <span class="companylink">Danisco</span>, a leading global producer of food components, on pilot tests for the manufacture of probiotics for yogurt.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the Canadian Institute of Food Science and Technology recognized En-Wave with an award for "outstanding applied development in the food sector."</p>
<p>Durance, who has been a professor in UBC's food, nutrition and health program since 1987, and holds 14 patents, accepted the award on behalf of EnWave.</p>
<p>The technology is straightforward in concept, involving a microwave generator not unlike the one you've got in your kitchen, connected to a vacuum chamber where the food is rotated in a manner similar to a front-load washing machine in order to ensure even exposure to the microwaves.</p>
<p>The key is the vacuum chamber, which is where Durance and EnWave co-CEO John Mc-Nicol believe their technology has a significant edge over conventional freeze-drying.</p>
<p>"When you put something under vacuum it lowers the boiling point. Just like going up a mountain, water boils at a lower temperature because the pressure is lower," Durance explains during a visit to the company's test lab.</p>
<p>"We reduce the pressure [in the vacuum chamber] until the boiling point of water is about body temperature. The problem with vacuum is that it reduces the transfer of energy -- it doesn't cross a vacuum well, except for radiant energy. So we use microwave as a source of radiant energy.</p>
<p>"So then, you can dry things as fast as you want. You can dry it in minute if you want.</p>
<p>"Practically speaking, we usually end up around 10 or 15 minutes but it's really just as fast as you want to put the energy in."</p>
<p>EnWave calls the process "radiant energy vacuum" or REV.</p>
<p>Rapid dehydration in a vacuum means there's no time for food to spoil: no opportunity for oxidization to turn apple slices brown because there's no oxygen to set it off, no moisture to allow micro-organisms to release enzymes that cause food to decay. "You will never get anything growing on it," Durance said. "You won't get bacteria or mould growing if the water level is low enough. So we dry it to the point where microbial spoilage is not a problem, not an issue.</p>
<p>"Drying is an excellent preservative. Actually, it's the same preservative as freezing which removes the water as ice -- while drying just removes the water."</p>
<p>The difference is that the REV method is faster than freeze-drying by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>However, even after the technology proved viable for food, EnWave foundered both as a potential commercial enterprise and as a publicly traded company.</p>
<p>Some of that was a due to a lack of promotional acumen. Some was due to the need for an innovation that would increase the number of ways the technology could be applied, expanding EnWave's potential to market its technology.</p>
<p>Things began to fall into place in 2007 when Durance finally figured out how to tweak the food-drying method to encompass other organic materials -- particularly for medical applications by lowering the temperature at which the biological material can be successfully processed.</p>
<p>At present, vaccines can be preserved for a few months with refrigeration, but En-Wave's tests with its dehydration method suggest that something like a flu shot or an inoculation against polio could remain viable for a longer period of time without being kept cold.</p>
<p>EnWave achieves that result by exposing the pharmaceutical materials to a level of vacuum that lowers the boiling point of the material to a level below that which would be required to freeze it -- essentially freeze-drying without using refrigeration.</p>
<p>It remains to be proven that REV will be cost effective at a mass production level, but the implications are intriguing for efforts to distribute medical aide in the Third World, or quickly vaccinate large numbers of people against an H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>One of the company's pharmaceutical dehydrators is undergoing tests by the Saskatchewan Research Council, one of Canada's leading agencies for research into the commercialization of technology.</p>
<p>McNicol came aboard in 2007 as the broader possibilities of REV became apparent, bringing a level of entrepreneurial acumen he'd acquired in the successful development of an unrelated drying technology, using paper products, a decade earlier.</p>
<p>Today the company has $6 million in capital, a $175,000 a month cash-burn rate, no debt and a market cap of $60 million.</p>
<p>"The freeze-dry industry has been around for 50 years. It was extremely established," McNicol said in an interview. "When I got in there and looked at how they do it, it was anywhere from 24 to 72 hours of processing time in batches.</p>
<p>"It's old, very slow, and very expensive. I call it a beautiful science but it's an awkward operating method."</p>
<p>EnWave's business model will centre on licensing the technology and collecting royalties from the companies that use it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Make domestic child health a priority; Canada should mimic its global policy; invest in our own vulnerable youth</b>
</div><div>Paul Kershaw   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>793 words</div><div>8 July 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>This year on Canada Day we had lots to celebrate, including the fact that Canadians hosted the world twice: for athletic excellence during the Olympics, and global politics during the G8/G20 summits.</p>
<p>We were leaders in both venues, winning more gold medals, and committing proportionately more new aid to child and maternal health in developing nations than any other country. There is good reason to feel proud.</p>
<p>But as the Canada Day festivities slip into memory, it is time to reflect on our shortcomings as much as our strengths. The G8/G20 focus on child health is a good starting point.</p>
<p>Presently, our global leadership on this issue is a case of "do as I say, not as I do."</p>
<p>Although it is important to support child health elsewhere, it is ironic for Canadians to feign leadership when nearly 30 per cent of our own children are vulnerable by the time they reach kindergarten.</p>
<p>Vulnerable young Canadians struggle with age-appropriate tasks such as holding a pencil, climbing stairs, following teachers' instructions, getting along on the playground, and knowing 10 letters.</p>
<p>Our domestic child development woes received little attention in advance of the G8/G20 summits, while international maternal and child health was debated in the House of Commons and in the media.</p>
<p>Why? Part of the answer is that pride in our medical system inclines us to believe incorrectly that Canada excels at promoting health.</p>
<p>There is no doubt our system is good at preventing women and children from dying during pregnancy and childbirth. In fact, we are comfortable spending hundreds of thousands of dollars, if not more, to save one pre-term baby.</p>
<p>But while we go to heroic measures to help one sick individual, we are not generous in promoting the population's health by guaranteeing all families with children access to decent housing, food, early learning or quality child care, and enough unstressed time together.</p>
<p>The limited availability of these community supports is why nearly a third of the next generation of Canadians are vulnerable before they start school.</p>
<p>Put bluntly, we have a disease fetish in Canada. And the medical care system reinforces it.</p>
<p>Think about our impressive reaction to the H1N1 epidemic. Perhaps because we were able to inoculate so many, we had fewer flu deaths that year than on average.</p>
<p>Although this is important, our fear about H1N1 obscured the real pandemic.</p>
<p>Research shows that our early vulnerability rate predisposes a third of the population to more obesity, high blood pressure and mental illness by age 30 and 40; more coronary heart disease and diabetes by age 50 and 60; and premature aging and memory loss thereafter.</p>
<p>In short, our population will be sicker and suffer far more premature deaths so long as we tolerate the unnecessarily high rate of child vulnerability.</p>
<p>Regrettably, it is hard to re-think the health-care system in Canada, even as it absorbs larger shares of total public spending.</p>
<p>Sure there is a debate about how much private delivery should be permitted.</p>
<p>But this distracts from the most pressing question: What do we owe one another when our ability to treat illness and stave off death grows with costly new drugs and technology?</p>
<p>Our answers to this question impede health promotion. We were reminded of this most recently in B.C. as preventive health services were cut during the recession; and we consistently resist investing in child care and other early health-promotion services because funds are required to pay for the growing clinical budget.</p>
<p>Questioning the extent to which illness treatment crowds out investment in other social policy must become non-partisan.</p>
<p>This critique is presently risky for politicians, because publicly funded medical care is so important to Canadian identity; we refer to it when distinguishing ourselves from neighbours to the south.</p>
<p>But this means "being Canadian" is literally making us sick. So long as we leave unquestioned the place of medical care in our broader social policy strategy, we risk our population's health by failing to invest in its social determinants, especially during childhood.</p>
<p>Canada ranks near the bottom internationally when it comes to policies that help parents have enough resources, community services and time to care personally.</p>
<p>If we really prioritize child health, as suggested at the G8/G20 summits, Canadians must redress this poor ranking by also investing in such policies domestically.</p>

<p>Thornhill, Ont. -- As co-chair of a coalition of emergency doctors and paramedics urging more bystander CPR, I was heartened by your editorial advocating compulsory CPR education in high schools (CPR Should Be Compulsory In High-School Education – editorial, July 2). This will gradually increase the number of citizens performing this life-saving measure. Moreover, the costs are negligible.</p>
<p>Although large sums were spent on the perceived H1N1 epidemic,</p>
<p>exponentially more lives could be saved if more people learned</p>
<p>bystander CPR. Studies confirm that a person's rate of “completely intact” survival goes up at least four times when bystander CPR is done.</p>
<p>We have advocated making CPR courses tax deductible. This would be a small tax saving for an individual but a substantial saving for a large corporation and would help ensure a safer workplace. It would also help immensely to increase the critical mass in the population of those who could do bystander CPR.</p>
<p>Our coalition has made overtures to the health, education and finance ministers of Ontario to meet and advance these critical initiatives. So far, we've been refused any meeting: Where are the real priorities of this government on Ontarians' health?</p>

</div><div>Michael Rachlis

</p>
<p>Canadians tend to mock Americans' ignorance of our country and the rest of the world. We do know more about their country than they know about ours. But we also tend to be unsophisticated when it comes to the rest of the world. Canadians need to become a lot more refined if we want medicare to be there for the next generation.</p>
<p>When we compare ourselves internationally, we start and often stop with the United States. Of course, our health system does well when compared with the U.S. But so do almost all other developed countries' health systems. It's like winning a high jump contest against a bunch of midgets. The bar is very low. It means a lot more when we beat the U.S. at hockey.</p>
<p>The U.S.-based Commonwealth Fund released their latest comparison of seven health systems on June 25. Predictably, the U.S. system rated last overall and that was the focus of the fund's report and the U.S. and international coverage. But Canada was second last. We were last for overall quality, effective care and timeliness of access. We scored second last on efficiency.</p>
<p>The report compared Canada with other countries 18 times in the text. These included two favourable comparisons and 16 unfavourable ones, including indictments for long waits, the poor management of chronic conditions (like diabetes), the lack of electronic systems, poor care coordination and the failure to involve patients in decisions about their care.</p>
<p>Other countries, such as the U.K., scored better than Canada while spending a smaller share of their economy on health. And the U.K.'s system is actually more public than ours.</p>
<p>The main determinant of overall health-care system performance is the quality of primary health care. Unfortunately, Canada's system of family doctors and a few community health centres just isn't built to carry the load that it must if Canada is to beat anyone but the U.S. in the health-care Olympics.</p>
<p>The Ontario Health Quality Council has shown that this province's primary health-care services have been getting slightly more effective. The provincial government has established a plethora of new primary health-care models for private doctors. Anecdotally, there is some innovation and many doctors report rejuvenated professional lives. But evaluations indicate that the province has spent a lot of money establishing family health teams in wealthier areas of the province and the new patients enrolled have tended to be relatively healthy.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hundreds of thousands of Ontarians still don't have a primary care provider and the vast majority of current practices in this province still lack integrated health records. As the H1N1 flu problems demonstrated, we need to fully engage primary health care with its natural partner, public health. Ontarians should find it cold comfort to know that primary health care is as bad or worse in other provinces.</p>
<p>Primary health care was identified as a priority by Justice Emmett Hall's national review of medicare in 1980, Dr. John Evans' Ontario-based review in 1987, and dozens of times since. Yet change is still something feared by most providers and many patients as we cling to the mantra that we are better than the U.S.</p>
<p>Paul Martin's 10-year federal-provincial-territorial health accord of 2004 was supposed to heal health care for a generation. But it turned out to be just enough to get the feds back into the health policy arena and give the old system some breathing space.</p>
<p>The Romanow Commission called for federal money to buy change. Unfortunately from my perspective, the calculus of federal-provincial politics ensured that the 2004 accord gave money without strings. It looks even bleaker for those of us favouring a strong federal presence at the table in 2014.</p>
<p>That means it's up to the provinces to take on the heavy lifting of reform. Father of medicare Tommy Douglas always said that medicare would be implemented in two stages.</p>
<p>The first was public payment for the old system based on treating illness in hospitals. He said the second stage would feature a new system, designed as much as possible to keep people healthy.</p>
<p>He predicted that the second stage would be more difficult to attain than the first and he was right. But we need to move quickly on the second stage or we will risk losing the first. As the Commonwealth Fund study reminds us, we have a long journey ahead of us.</p>

</p>
<p>Two traumatized Hamilton-Wentworth Detention Centre correctional officers have been unable to return to work since being forced to the ground at gunpoint in November by a pair of masked men helping a prisoner to escape.</p>
<p>Assistant Crown attorney Brent Bentham said it likely came as "cold comfort" to the jail guards -- a woman and a man -- to learn the handguns pointed at their heads were replicas.</p>
<p>Bentham urged a prison sentence of six to eight years yesterday for Aram Hadi, 20, one of four men accused of participating in the brazen daylight escape.</p>
<p>The correctional officers were rushed by two men at 11:20 a.m. on Nov. 24, 2009 as they escorted the handcuffed and shackled prisoner from Hamilton General Hospital. The inmate had been at the hospital for treatment of gunshot wounds sustained in a previous robbery.</p>
<p>Hadi, who knew the wounded inmate from jail, pleaded guilty on June 16 to five charges, including using an imitation firearm, assisting an escape, robbery, being masked in the commission of a crime and breach of probation.</p>
<p>Bentham asked Ontario Court Justice Maria Speyer to prohibit Hadi for life from possessing firearms, ammunition or explosives and to order his DNA profile entered into Canada's national crime database.</p>
<p>At the time of the escape, Hadi was serving a sentence on weekends at a Toronto jail and was on probation for cocaine trafficking.</p>
<p>The prisoner escape was orchestrated from inside the Barton Street jail and began with a coded message sent to a man on the outside. That message was communicated by cellphone to the get-away driver, who notified Hadi and his accomplice to take up their positions outside the hospital.</p>
<p>At the time of Hadi's guilty plea, the judge imposed a ban on publication of the accomplices' identities to protect their right to a fair trial.</p>
<p>Two men wearing dark hoodies and respiratory masks had been seen hanging around the hospital the day before. Their masks did not attract a lot of attention, given heightened concerns about infection control following last year's H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Bentham said the plan to threaten the unarmed guards with imitation firearms demonstrated the "level of violence that Mr. Hadi was prepared to buy into, even at this relatively young stage of his life."</p>
<p>Defence lawyer Ian Begg recommended a sentence of three to five years. He said rehabilitation was still a prospect for a young man with one prior conviction on his adult record.</p>
<p>Hamilton police began a massive manhunt for the escaped prisoner and his accomplices. Hadi and the other gunman were arrested two days later at an east Hamilton residence. A day after that, the get-away driver and escaped prisoner were also found.</p>
<p>Hadi still faces a charge of being unlawfully at large after he was questioned by police and initially released, but then failed to show up at the Toronto jail to serve his weekend sentence.</p>
<p>Judge Speyer is expected to sentence Hadi on July 12.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Google this: a cure for Parkinson's; Search engine's co-founder uses power to harness a disease he will likely develop</b>
</div><div>Nick Allen   </div>
<div>Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>617 words</div><div>3 July 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Sergey Brin, the co-founder of <span class="companylink">Google</span>, is harnessing the power of his search engine in an attempt to find a cure for Parkinson's disease.</p>
<p>Brin, 36, is creating a database of information from thousands of sufferers and will use computers to find links between them.</p>
<p>Brin, who is worth about $17.5 billion US, entered the medical research field after discovering several years ago that he has a high chance of developing Parkinson's himself.</p>
<p>His mother Eugenia, a former NASA mathematician, was diagnosed in 1999 and a genetic test put Brin's own chances of developing the disease at 80 per cent.</p>
<p>He has described the pace of research into Parkinson's as "glacial" compared with developments on the Internet and hopes that his methods will dramatically accelerate the search for a cure.</p>
<p>He has invited 10,000 Parkinson's sufferers to take part in the project, asking them to pay a nominal fee to make sure they are committed. About 4,000 have already signed up. Those involved are sent a test kit, which they spit into and return for analysis. They are also asked to answer detailed questionnaires about their lifestyle, as environmental factors can affect chances of developing the disease.</p>
<p>Algorithms will be used to find meaningful patterns in the flood of data.</p>
<p>Most previous research into Parkinson's has followed the traditional process of scientists coming up with a hypothesis and carrying out focused studies on smaller groups of patients.</p>
<p>Brin wants to reverse the process, collecting vast amounts of information first and then using computers to look for trends.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Google</span> has entered the health field before, quickly detecting outbreaks of flu and swine flu by tracking search queries entered by Internet users around the world.</p>
<p>In an interview with Wired magazine, Brin said: "It just goes to show that when you apply our new found computational power to large amounts of data, and sometimes it's not perfect data, it can be very powerful. We could be looking lots of places and collecting lots of information and, if we see a pattern, that could lead somewhere."</p>
<p>Parkinson's is a degenerative neurological condition that impairs functions such as speech and movement. There is currently no cure.</p>
<p>Around 10,000 people are diagnosed in Britain each year, with the first symptoms usually appearing in those over 50. In Canada, about 100,000 people are currently living the disease.</p>
<p>Brin is the latest in a line of wealthy philanthropists who have tried to find a cure for their own conditions and has already contributed some $50 million to Parkinson's research.</p>
<p>He discovered his increased chance of developing Parkinson's after taking a test offered by a genetic testing company called 23andMe, which is run by his wife, Anne Wojcicki.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Google</span> has invested more than $6 million in the company and Brin has put in $10 million of his own. It is gathering the data for his Parkinson's study.</p>
<p>His test showed he had inherited a mutation of the LRRK2 gene from his mother, increasing his own chances of developing Parkinson's. His one year-old son is also being tested for the mutation.</p>

historic Chelsea Market in New York City in 2009. Brin is using the
power of the search engine to help find a cure for Parkinson's
disease, which he says he has a high probability of developing.   </p>

<div id="hd"><b>Eric McCormack part of scenery at Arts Club Theatre fundraiser</b>
</div><div>Malcolm Parry   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>906 words</div><div>3 July 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>THERE'S A WILL: Former Will & Grace TV series star Eric McCormack will play a realtor from hell in an Arts Club Theatre staging of David Mamet's Glengarry Glen Ross. His character could find few better listings than the West Vancouver residence Mc-Cormack visited Wednesday. It was the forest-fringing home of <span class="companylink">Tricor Pacific Capital</span> co-founder David Rowntree and entrepreneur Leah Costello, where MCL Motor Cars and Zahra Mamdani's Wear Else clothing chain sponsored a benefit for the theatre company. Arts Club chief Bill Millerd, who emceed the soiree, could see the waterfront locale of his family's cannery, now a fisheries research station.</p>
<p>Costello has a big fish hooked, too. It's Sarah Palin, the putative U.S. presidential candidate who will speak Oct. 13 in the Bon Mot Book Club series Costello launched recently. Others addressing $500-a-ticket events at the Vancouver Club will include former Pakistan president Pervez Musharraf and economist-author Michael Lewis, whose The Big Short reportedly details "how the U.S. economy was driven over the cliff."</p>
<p>Rowntree, who co-owns the city-based Douglas & McIntyre publishing firm, looked to be on life's cliff edge recently. But surgeons opened his skull "like a coconut," and removed a benign tumour from his right eye-socket, said Costello, who by any reckoning is a sight for sore eyes.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>MORE LOVING: It's been 15 years since B.C. diving gold-medallist Heather Clifford left the small screen -- she'd played Lily on the soap Loving -- to sell big houses, nowadays in Whistler. There she met RCMP Insp. Norm McPhail, the Sea to Sky region commander who is now provincial liaison officer.</p>
<p>"My job is to bring government and police agencies together to reduce crime ... and make sure all RCMP detachments in B.C. have a crime-reduction policy in place," he said. Clifford believes her squeeze of 18 months should have an elected-office policy in place.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>BACK TO LIFE: Movie and theatre producer Paul Armstrong found Vancouver Life magazine's March 1968 edition at MacLeod's Books recently. Its cover story about Vancouver' influential citizens was written by James Holt. That was a pseudonym for then-Vancouver Sun columnist Alan Fotheringham, who moved easily in such circles. Not so in the case of late bookseller Don MacLeod, who was a far-left-winger but could still rationalize the capitalist good life. When neighbours questioned the loaded Chevrolet hardtop he bought new in 1968, MacLeod smilingly riposted: "Built by the workers."</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>ANOTHER BAILS UP: Our [expletive deleted] spellchecking system did it again recently. I wrote -- albeit, preciously --of folk having "their gasts flabbered." The ever-helpful system changed it to "their gases flabbered," which sounds like intestinal Armageddon. Curiously, it did accept the non-word "flabbered" rather than inserting "jabbered."</p>
<p>That brings to mind Lewis Carroll's children's poem, Jabberwocky, which begins: "'Twas brillig, and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe; / All mimsy were the borogoves, / and the mome raths outgrabe." Had spellchecking computers existed in 1872, it might have been printed as Jabber Wacky and read: "Twos drilling and the smithy tones / did lyre and gamble in the wave; / All misty were the borough ones, / And the home paths out grave."</p>
<p>As for Robert Burns's "Hae, there's a ripp to thy auld baggie: / Tho' thou's howe-backit now, an' knaggie," let's leave unwell enough alone.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>DRAW FAST, ARTISTS: Curator Julie Lee usually undertakes large arts-related function such as last month's Unite With Art gala that raised a reported $460,000 for UNICEF Canada's AIDS-related activities. But she handles smaller projects, too, like Drawing Party 2 that ran at Gallery Jones recently. It kicked off the July 17-Aug. 7 Drawn Festival, where 15 city galleries will show contemporary works. Draw well and you can do anything, the saying goes. The Gallery Jones function encouraged that with wall-mounted paper sheets for anyone to embellish, including Lee's goddaughter, Clara Leiterman-Joy.</p>
<p>-</p>
<p>TAKE A SEAT: As for sculpture, Jenny Lee wrote in Tuesday's Vancouver Sun about the ever-more-popular Fidelity Denim jeans that company founder-designer Jason Trotzuk calls "bras for the butt." Under-buttock darts enhance contouring, Trotzuk once said, while side seams stitched further forward seemingly slim a wearer's thighs. Artists need muses, of course. Trotzuk's was wife Kitty, who needs no cutting-room artifice.</p>

<p>I don't plan to retire any time soon, but for years I had a retirement plan worked out with my long-time friend and fellow journalist Phil Anwyl. It was impressive in its simplicity, perhaps because it dates back to simpler days when the Free Press was located downtown, where a newspaper office should be, and Central Park was the kind of place where burnt-out newspapermen might actually feel comfortable.</p>
<p>Our intention was to meet every morning at the Ellice Avenue Liquor Commission, each buy a bottle of bingo in a brown paper bag and proceed to the park where would we sip away and play checkers all day among the other old-timers. When we had drunk our plonk and been mugged sufficiently by the gang members and others who were indigenous to Central Park, we would go home. There was a certain genius to it all, given the constrained economic circumstances that retired hacks often find themselves in.</p>
<p>Phil spoiled that plan, however. He died, and I don't play checkers by myself. Come to think of it, I don't even like checkers, although I do like a bottle of good bingo once in a while. And then the city put the final kibosh on my Freedom 75 retirement plan by restoring genuine park status to Central Park.</p>
<p>For decades the downtown bit of greenery had deteriorated into a gathering place for gangs and drunks and panhandlers, a place where a decent citizen would dread to tread, even in daylight hours.</p>
<p>Now, however, the city is taking back a bit of downtown, reclaiming the park for the kids and families to whom it rightfully belongs. A $5.6 million renovation of Central Park will be officially unveiled at the end of July. The fountain has been refurbished and will actually have water running in it again, there is a soccer pitch for kids to play on in the summer and a water park. In the winter there will be a slide and a skating rink. It will be a park for the people all year round rather than the hide away for hooligans that it has been for so many years -- since the renovations began, there has been 17 per cent drop in crime reported in and around the park, the population has risen by 11 per cent and families, mothers with their children, have replaced the gangsters and the plonk drinkers.</p>
<p>Central Park serves as a model of urban renewal, and even though Phil and I will never play checkers there as we had planned, I am pretty sure that from his vantage point in St. Vital cemetery, he is happy to see what has happened.</p>
<p>one to watch...</p>
<p>There is a serious problem with flu viruses: they mutate and change so readily that a new vaccine has to be created each flu season, and sometimes, as with last year's H1N1, the vaccine is barely designed and manufactured in time. It seems inevitable that a mutation will come along that develops so quickly and lethally that the vaccine labs can't catch up, and the world will have the kind of pandemic that it feared last year, or like it had in 1919. But no matter how a virus mutates, it seems, some regions on the virus remain unchanged through the evolutionary process. Now, a small Seattle biotech company, Theraclone, has discovered rare anti-flu antibodies that lock onto that common area. Starting with 100,000 antibodies in 140 patients, Theraclone scientists did the proverbial needle-in-a-haystack search and found 17 of them that qualified. So far, the antibodies, administered in large doses, have protected mice from flu viruses. It's an encouraging first step," said Matthew Moyle, study chief scientific officer at Theraclone, Perhaps in a year, there will be tests on humans. If all goes well, the antibodies could be administered as flu protection. That would be a stopgap measure during the outbreak of a potentially lethal strain of flu. The next step would be to create a vaccine that induced each of us to produce those universal antibodies, protecting us not only against killer strains, but also the nuisance varieties that lay so many people low each season. In the meantime, cover your mouth when you sneeze.</p>
<p>Call yourselves anarchists?</p>
<p>Not you Black Bloc thugs</p>
<p>Canadians had their first major confrontation with anarchy during the G20 summit in Toronto last weekend. So-called, self-styled Black Bloc anarchists fomented much or most of the violence that marked the summit, but they were not in fact anarchists at all. There is a certain naive nobility to the true concept of anarchy. According to the classical definitions, it consists of societies that "have no rulership or enforced authority..." but exist in "a social state in which there is no governing person or group of people, but each individual has absolute liberty (without the implication of disorder) but is bound by a social code."</p>
<p>That clearly doesn't apply to the Black Bloc or almost anyone else who identifies herself as an anarchist these days. True anarchy implies that people are capable of keeping order without state authority -- a wonderfully fanciful notion -- and the Black Bloc, if it proves anything except that some people are just plain bad, indicates that most cannot. In fact, there has hardly ever been an anarchist who could keep order without a policeman keeping an eye on him.</p>
<p>The well-known anarchist Camille Paglia said "My thinking tends to be libertarian. That is, I oppose intrusions of the state into the private realm -- as in abortion, sodomy, prostitution, pornography, drug use, or suicide, all of which I would strongly defend as matters of free choice in a representative democracy."</p>
<p>This is not what traditional political anarchists such as Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin had in mind when they started terroristic anarchism in Russia in the 1800s. They were all in favour of violence, but they did not hide in crowds like the Black Bloc did in Toronto, letting peaceful protesters take the heat from the police, nor did they see themselves as diversions, hiding behind the skirts of Quebec schoolgirls so that other organizations could take the lead in trying to change the world.</p>
<p>And finally, they weren't trying to create a world that was safe for "abortion, sodomy, prostitution, pornography, drug use, or suicide." In fact, in the imaginary village world they were trying to create, none of those things would have been allowed. There is a kind of honour in genuine anarchy. There is no honour, no courage, not even any apparent political principle in the Black Bloc. As the Toronto police say and most Canadians now know, they are simply thugs.</p>
<p>Idle hands at tax office</p>
<p>not a bad idea, on reflection</p>
<p>Using the Access to Information Act, The Canadian Press has discovered that a lot of Canada Revenue Agency employees are using their working hours to browse through the Internet rather than your tax returns, as they should be doing.</p>
<p>About 85 employees a year are disciplined, although not very harshly, for spending their well-paid working days gambling on the Internet, surfing the Web, chatting with co-workers, friends and relatives and "promoting 'illegal substances,' sharing offensive cartoons and running pyramid schemes," the news agency reports. And that's just the ones who get caught.</p>
<p>Some of them do even worse than that, checking the tax returns of their former husbands or wives, relatives and creditors. One allegedly -- the case is still in progress -- specialized in exposing the financial affairs and tax returns of sports celebrities. Personally, I would prefer to know about politicians, but to each his own.</p>
<p>The initial reaction of honest taxpayers to this situation is naturally one of outrage. To start with, no one likes tax collectors anyway, and lazy, indolent, overpaid, underworked, gossip-mongering tax collectors are really stretching the limits.</p>
<p>But let's not be too hasty here. There are at least a couple of reasons to be more tolerant of these revenuers' indiscretions. For one, "honest taxpayer" is probably an oxymoron, since most of you avoid paying taxes on anything you think you can get away with, and even a Canadian court has ruled that it is every citizen's duty to diligently avoid paying any tax she isn't absolutely legally bound to pay.</p>
<p>And there is the more practical reason for taking the more reasoned position in judging the revenuers' idling and lollygagging. That is precisely that, while they are idling their time away lollygagging on the Internet, they are not looking through your tax returns in the hope of finding something they can use to either bankrupt you or send you to jail.</p>
<p>If you think about it that way, the tax returns of Ken Dryden and other sports stars start to look pretty darn interesting, and who is to judge what makes a cartoon "offensive" anyway?</p>

<p>More than nine million doses of antiviral medications in the country's stockpile -- three million of which were set aside to be used in the event of a "national emergency" -- will expire by the end of this year, but health officials say they will still have enough drugs on hand if an influenza pandemic strikes Canada.</p>
<p>Of the 23.8 million doses of antiviral medicines in the federal National Emergency Stockpile System -- comprised of oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza) -- about three million will expire at the end of 2010. Tamiflu that was manufactured prior to 2008 carries a five-year shelf-life.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada "is discussing options with the supplier" about what to do with antivirals that have reached their stated shelf life, spokeswoman Charlene Wiles said in an e-mail. Options include purchasing new antivirals and disposing of the expired product, or returning nearly expired antivirals to the manufacturer in exchange for new antivirals with a seven-year shelf life at a reduced cost.</p>
<p>A separate plan to reprocess the existing stock -- extracting the active agent from Tamiflu tablets and capsules to prolong its shelf life -- has yet to receive regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The mission of the emergency stockpile program is to provide a "rapid response to an emerging pandemic."</p>
<p>Wiles said that, despite the fact that more than 10 per cent of the federal stockpile is set to expire this year, a review conducted in March indicated that Canada will still have enough drugs on hand to meet the terms of the country's pandemic influenza plan, which suggests holding enough antivirals for 17.5 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>This emergency supply is considered a backup to the regular provincially or territorially administered stockpile, known as the National Antiviral Stockpile.</p>
<p>The useful life of some of this stockpile, comprised of 58 million doses of antiviral medications distributed to provinces and territories on a per-capita basis, is also set to end. About six million of those doses have expired, or will expire this year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, provincial and federal governments are also debating tossing away millions of dollars worth of H1N1 vaccine because it was not used during swine flu season and will soon expire.</p>
<p>Governments had planned to keep much of the leftover vaccine in case of another outbreak, because doses were supposed to be good for 18 months. But in April, Health Canada abruptly reduced the best-before date to only six months because the adjuvanted H1N1 antigen was shown to decline in strength over time, catching many provinces off guard.</p>
<p>Now, Manitoba stands to lose $2 million worth of excess vaccine; Saskatchewan might have to dispose of 470,000 unused doses, at an unknown cost; and in B.C., 2.5 million doses worth $20 million are set to expire.</p>

</div><div>Mariam Ibrahim   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal, with files from Julianna Cummins</div>

<p>After 28 years helping Canadian immigrants and refugees improve their English language skills, a newspaper sponsored by the provincial government has lost its funding.</p>
<p>English Express, published by the Alberta Advanced Education and Technology, is designed to help adults improve their reading skills. It is distributed in 259 communities across the province, and in almost 50 communities in the Yukon, the Northwest and in the Nunavut territories.</p>
<p>In an e-mail Thursday, government spokeswoman Katrina Bluetchen confirmed that after consideration of resources and priorities, the ministry has decided not to continue publishing the newspaper, which has a total circulation of about 60,000.</p>
<p>"We need to ensure that we are making the best possible use of our resources to support learners and that we are focusing our efforts where we can have the greatest impact," she said.</p>
<p>"While this publication is winding down, we will (continue) to work with our stakeholders to help support adult learning in Alberta's communities."</p>
<p>The government's decision is cause for concern for people who work to enhance adult literacy; earlier this week, a co-ordinator with the Learning Centre Literacy Association sent an e-mail to volunteers urging them to lobby "decision-makers."</p>
<p>English Express is distributed to various literacy and adult-learning agencies in the province, along with businesses and public libraries.</p>
<p>The content is provided in three different proficiencies, up to about a Grade 4 level, and sometimes includes special inserts with helpful tips for newcomers, such as workplace safety and health advice.</p>
<p>As public concerns about H1N1 flu ramped up last winter, English Express explained what was going on to new Canadians.</p>
<p>Keith Anderson, an Edmonton-based ESL tutor, said the paper has been an invaluable resource in helping adults learn English in a way that is easy and relevant.</p>
<p>"For me, working with my student, when we work with textbooks, a lot of the material is old," Anderson said. "( English Express) is always current, interesting, up-to-date and my student looks forward to it so much."</p>
<p>Anderson said he hopes the ministry will reconsider its decision and the impact it may have on adults in Alberta trying to improve their literacy.</p>
<p>"It's too important," Anderson said. "And for the small amount of money it costs or whatever gain they'll get by axing it, it's not worth it.</p>
<p>"It's the kind of thing the government of Alberta should be proud of."</p>

<p>During last year's H1N1 flu pandemic, health officials repeatedly urged pregnant women to get vaccinated and to take anti-flu drugs if they became sick, calling the medicines important safeguards against a virus that hit the pregnant especially hard.</p>
<p>But now the Public Health Agency of Canada is commissioning a $500,000 study to track possible long-term effects of the flu, the vaccine and anti-viral medicine on women who were expecting during the pandemic -- and the children born to them since.</p>
<p>Though research so far has shown no harm from the drugs, "there remains concern about the relative paucity of information available regarding the safety of both the pandemic vaccine and of anti-virals during pregnancy," the agency said in a recently posted document.</p>

</p>
<p>More than $18-million worth of Tamiflu in federal and provincial warehouses has started to expire, forcing health officials to decide on the value of spending public dollars to restock antiviral drugs in case of a future pandemic.</p>
<p>About three million doses of the drug in Ottawa's national emergency stockpile are nearing the end of their five-year shelf life. About six million more have been expiring in British Columbia, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Public health officials, in the midst of evaluating their response to H1N1, are faced with three options: Destroy the expired oseltamivir – Tamiflu's generic name – and purchase more; reprocess the existing stock to prolong its shelf life (a program that has yet to receive regulatory approval and would also come with a hefty price tag); or make do with the millions of antiviral drugs it purchased just before and during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The benefits of bolstering the stockpile of antivirals to treat influenza have to be weighed against shelling out millions of dollars more for an expensive drug, the effectiveness of which is under some debate, and when there's vaccine already on hand. Tamiflu costs $50 for a 10-pack (a five-day supply), although Hoffmann-La Roche, its Swiss maker, said the Canadian government gets the drug at a discounted rate.</p>
<p>“We now have the opportunity to look a little bit more rigorously at how large does that stockpile need to be. … I think it's a legitimate question to ask, ‘Does it need to be replenished to the level it was?' ” said Lynn Johnston, president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.</p>
<p>The country's $2-billion campaign to protect Canadians against an influenza pandemic has come under scrutiny. Despite the millions spent, less than half the population was vaccinated. And in yet another controversy, <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical</span>, which is owned by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, has filed four separate applications in Federal Court to stop the government from making public the contract it received to produce the H1N1 vaccine. The contract became a source of controversy during the pandemic as serious issues with supply and delivery of the vaccine occurred and the government failed to release important details about the nature of its relationship with GSK.</p>
<p>John Spika, director general of the centre for immunization and respiratory infectious diseases at the Public Health Agency of Canada, said the government is reviewing its response to the pandemic, including the use of antivirals, and will likely have a decision by the fall on what it will do with its expiring stockpile.</p>
<p>The country's pandemic plan recommended the purchase of enough antivirals for 17.5 per cent of the population, although such provinces as B.C. and Ontario decided to augment that amount when significant stockpiling began in 2004. The federal government's national emergency stockpile system has another 23 million doses of antivirals, which includes Relenza, a less popular option because it must be inhaled.</p>
<p>Tamiflu works best when taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms, such as fever, cough and sore throat. Eric Young, B.C.'s deputy provincial health officer, said that even though the H1N1 pandemic was not as severe as feared, the antivirals reduced the death rate and the number of people hospitalized. His province recently exchanged its 2.9 million expired doses for ones with a seven-year shelf life.</p>
<p>“It still behooves us to plan for a moderate pandemic and be prepared to actually treat hundreds of thousands of people,” Dr. Young said.</p>
<p>Citing competitive reasons, Hoffmann-La Roche declined to reveal how much it charges Ottawa for the antivirals, although the total cost of the federal government's emergency stockpile shows that each dose costs just over $2.</p>

</p>
<p>RECOVERY</p>
<p>Eminem</p>
<p>(Interscope/Universal)</p>
<p>Rating 1 (out of five)</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Ah, Eminem. After finding new and more juvenile ways to offend on last year's desperate comeback album Relapse, he has finally hit rock bottom. Where he used to make you marvel at his ingenuity even as he said things that made you cringe, rap's once-reigning king/ court jester has finally become the butt of his own bathroom humour.</p>
<p>On Relapse, he turned five years of drug dependency and paranoia into a misogynistic, pill-popping slasher odyssey. It was offensive and stupid, but still, in its own twisted way, entertaining. It's the entertainment factor that's lacking this time out. Apparently trying to come back from his failed comeback, Em sounds tired, uninspired and simply sad.</p>
<p>He piles up superfluous expletives on opener Cold Wind Blows, having a relative moment of clarity when he says "might as well let my lips pucker like Elton John / Cause I'm a mean (expletive)."</p>
<p>No kidding. But really? Your buddy Elton? Again? Still?</p>
<p>He also drags old foils Mariah Carey and Michael J. Fox through the mud again as he grasps at relevance.</p>
<p>What is meant as the album's confessional anchor serves only to confirm his pathetic plight. "I almost made a song dissing Lil Wayne," he says, recalling his days of drug-fuelled delusion, on Talkin' 2 Myself. "It's like I was jealous of him cause of the attention he was getting."</p>
<p>He continues: "You're lying to yourself / You're slowing dying / You're denying your health is declining with your self-esteem / You're crying out for help."</p>
<p>If only we cared.</p>
<p>Questionable esthetic and lyrical choices pile up, but Eminem's biggest crime is simply being boring. He can't keep our attention, railing against who knows what on the blues-sampling stomper Won't Back Down: "Bitch, need I remind you, that I don't need the (expletive) swine flu / to be a sick pig."</p>
<p>Really? Swine flu?</p>
<p>He attempts an anthem on the redundant W.T.P. (which stands for White Trash Party), but finds clarity on the Ozzy Osbournesampling Going Through Changes: "I am finally realizing I need help." Ya think?</p>
<p>Even mid-confessional, Eminem is far from sympathetic. He is so far gone, so disconnected from anything resembling reality that attempted moments of truth come off like post-train-wreck Britney. But somehow Britney is more compelling.</p>

<p>The rows of desks were empty, the doors were sealed and the signs of corporate power taken down or concealed.</p>
<p>But that didn't mean the thousands of employees who regularly stalk the streets of Canada's financial district didn't have to work.</p>
<p>On Friday, security concerns and traffic tie-ups linked to the G20 summit meant most of the firms near the security zone adopted strategies to have employees work from home or in satellite offices.</p>
<p>"Is it preferable, no. Clearly it is an inconvenience to the business. But in general I think it went as well as could have been expected," said Jacqui d'Eon, a spokesperson for professional services firm <span class="companylink">Deloitte & Touche LLP</span>, explaining how the company remained productive with 2,000 workers locked out of downtown offices.</p>
<p>"A lot of our plans for the G20, in terms of the mobility of our workforce, were built around our plans for the H1N1 pandemic. So we were well prepared."</p>
<p>From Monday to Thursday staff were given the option to work from home or at any of the company's offices in Vaughan, Mississauga or North York. http://www.deloitte.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/view/en_CA/ca/index.htmDeloitteEND[http://www.deloitte.com.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/view/en_CA/ca/index.htmDeloitteEND] employs people in five locations in and around the financial district.</p>
<p>Staff working remotely is common, said d'Eon.</p>
<p>On Friday everyone was told to avoid the downtown area. Many used a virtual private network to remain connected, said d'Eon.</p>
<p>"We could have conference calls, we could have meetings ... everything worked beautifully," she said. The remote system could be sustained for several days, unless there were issues with servers, she said.</p>
<p>Part of her role meant keeping in touch with Deloitte's crisis team throughout the weekend to see if their offices had been damaged and all systems were working, said d'Eon. There was minor damage at a few locations, she said.</p>
<p>Her own work was interrupted a few times, as d'Eon lives at Queen St. W. and Spadina Ave. The busy intersection was the site of several standoffs with police.</p>
<p>"There were some moments on Saturday evening when thehttp://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829587--the-fire-the-accused-and-the-cop[http://www.thestar.com/news/gta/torontog20summit/article/829587--the-fire-the-accused-and-the-cop] cars were burning ENDI wasn't sure if I would be able to stay in the building or not," said d'Eon, who added the smell of burning police cruisers was perceptible in the hallway of her building.</p>

To the best of her knowledge, she said, clients' needs were met.</p>
<p>"The beauty of the G20 was we could plan," said O'Donnell. "I think the planning paid off."</p>
<p>She said part of the remote work plan resembled the approach the company would take during a severe storm or pandemic.</p>
<p>On Friday and the week leading up to the G20 summit in Toronto, staff were instructed to meet with clients outside the downtown core, she said.</p>
<p>One potential challenge was providing cheques for real estate closings, or court documents, but they prepared many in advance, she said.</p>
<p>Employees kept on top of emails and voicemails throughout the day - "something lawyers would do anyway" - and had on-call staff ready to help provide documentation via email.</p>
<p>Bob Fortier, president of http://www.ivc.ca/Inno-Visions[http://www.ivc.ca/Inno-Visions] CanadaEND, which specializes in remote work, said most large businesses have plans in place to allow workers to maintain productivity remotely for several days.</p>
<p>"In a way this is no different from a corporation being concerned about business continuity for other reasons," such as a snowstorm, strike or bomb scare, he said.</p>
<p>"We have remote work within our modern corporate DNA, so the stretch to doing it a little further away when it become difficult to get to our building is not a big one," Fortier added.</p>
<p>Jacqui d'Eon, of Deloitte & Touche LLP, says the firm remained productive during the G20 despite the fact workers were locked out of their offices.

</p>
<p>The Muskoka Initiative, formally announced Friday, has largely failed to inspire both at home and abroad. Despite the $2.85-billion, five-year commitment of Canadian taxpayer money, the initiative is high on rhetoric but short on detail.</p>
<p>Buzzwords -- like voluntary family planning, country ownership, health workers, information systems, continuum of care, accountability and effectiveness -- are abundant. But the details are missing. How will the initiative be co-ordinated with existing global health activities, particularly the Global Fund? Will the initiative promote universal access to health care for women and children, and if so, how will this be financed? While named in the communiqué, it is not clear how the initiative fits in with the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) as well as the UN Joint Action Plan for Women's and Children's Health.</p>
<p>The G8 communiqué claims the initiative will prevent the deaths of 1.3 million children five years and under and 64,000 maternal deaths while enabling 12 million couples to access family planning. Yet no information is provided on how these goals will be achieved. Perhaps this lack of specificity is the reason that matching contributions from other G8 countries were disappointingly low. A request for billions of dollars is normally accompanied by a strategic plan.</p>
<p>The lack of enthusiasm abroad is met with skepticism at home. This government recently cut funds to organizations working for the rights of women in Canada and abroad. It also decimated Status of Women Canada, and shut down gender equality units at the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA).</p>
<p>If Prime Minister Stephen Harper wants Canada to contribute to reducing maternal mortality, he must recognize that maternal health is not a one-off, stand-alone issue.</p>
<p>Improving maternal health depends on the protection, promotion and advancement of the rights and freedoms of women and girls. Canada needs to push countries to fully respect these rights and support programs at home and abroad that allow women and girls to realize them.</p>
<p>Such rights include the ability to access affordable, appropriate and effective health care, as well as the right to clean water and sanitation. Women have a right to be educated, deserve equal opportunities for employment and credit, as well as protection of their property and inheritance rights. The right of women to mobilize as members of civil society and to seek political office must be supported. Voluntary family planning is only voluntary if women's rights are respected and if they have choice. To quote from the Beijing Platform, women must "have control over and decide freely and responsibly on matters related to their sexuality, including sexual and reproductive health, free of coercion, discrimination and violence."</p>
<p>The Muskoka Initiative also needs to be closely linked to Canadian engagement in broader global health initiatives. In advance of the UN's September MDG Summit, experts are debating how to generate more resources while ensuring that global health interventions are better co-ordinated and managed at the country level. Despite its G8 focus on maternal health, Canada has been largely silent on these debates, nor are they reflected in the G8 communiqué.</p>
<p>This silence is not new. Canada's response to global health challenges has been largely reactive, driven by public policy issues such as the threat of H1N1, or by international processes at the World Health Organization and other multilateral agencies. This policy vacuum is accompanied by institutional fragmentation. Global health responsibilities are dispersed among CIDA, Health Canada, and the Public Health Agency of Canada. CIDA does not even list health as one of its three priorities, while Health Canada has few resources for international programming.</p>
<p>Canada, with its expertise in public health and its experience delivering universal health care to a dispersed and diverse population, should be a natural leader in global health. To realize this leadership potential, the government should articulate a bold Global Health Strategy -- like the U.S. and British strategies -- that identifies how Canada's global health engagement will protect and improve the health of Canadians and of people around the world. This vision would articulate how best to marshal Canadian government, civil society and academic resources, and clearly delineate institutional responsibilities to implement global health initiatives.</p>
<p>Harper can take this opportunity to frame the maternal health initiative as a key component of Canada's larger engagement on global health, and accompany the initiative by championing the rights of women and girls. Doing so will not only allay the cynics, it will provide a more inspirational, successful and sustainable foundation for the Muskoka Maternal Health Initiative.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>We need to help-- and innovate</b>
</div><div>Peter A. Singer   </div>
<div>Special to the National Post</div>
<div>892 words</div><div>28 June 2010</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A22</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2010 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>As a Canadian, I am proud that our Prime Minister chose to focus the G8 meeting in Muskoka on maternal and child health. There are about eight million child deaths and 350,000 maternal deaths every year, mostly in the developing world. It is simply unethical that 13 times as many children die in developing countries than in rich countries, or that 50 times as many women die in childbirth. These are unconscionable figures since we have many solutions and can find new solutions where they are currently lacking.</p>
<p>Harnessing global political will to confront these challenges is essential. Fortunately, the G8 and G20 can play a critical role in global health. We need to take the solutions we know to scale to reach many more people. We also need to innovate to create new and better solutions. Scaling and innovation together will save lives.</p>
<p>We know a great deal about the causes of maternal and child health problems. The main reasons for maternal deaths are bleeding, infection, obstructed labour, eclampsia (life-threatening high blood pressure in pregnancy) and unsafe abortion. The main causes of deaths in newborns are infection, birth asphyxia and pre-term birth. The main causes of childhood deaths beyond the newborn period are diarrhea, pneumonia, malaria, measles, HIV/AIDS and, underlying many of these deaths, malnutrition.</p>
<p>We also know a lot about many of the solutions. The G8 should continue to fund these crucial activities. I applaud the announcement to provide $7.3-billion over five years for maternal and child health. But while scaling up and delivering what we know is necessary, it is not enough. We need to innovate to discover new solutions-- to lessen what we don't know.</p>
<p>What don't we know about maternal and child health? We know very little about eclampsia (which kills women) and pre-term labour (which kills newborns) in the developing world. To prevent childhood deaths, we are just now developing a pneumococcal vaccine for the developing world, have only recently developed a rotavirus diarrhea vaccine and still don't have a malaria vaccine -- although a partially effective one is close. We also don't know how malnutrition impedes the intellectual development of children, robbing them of their potential. Even with improved delivery of health services we have more to learn. A recent study showed that</p>
<p>despite its name the Accelerated Child Survival and Development program, in two West African countries, did not accelerate survival.</p>
<p>Let's assume for the sake of argument that we know 75% of the causes of and solutions to maternal and child health problems. We need to bring to scale this 75%. Scaling known interventions is primarily the funding role the G8 has traditionally filled. It's important. It generates results. It should be strongly supported.</p>
<p>But then there's the 25% we don't know. Here we need to innovate because innovation saves lives and provides new and better (and more affordable) ways of doing things.</p>
<p>Other leaders that attended the G20 summit in Toronto this past weekend -- from China, India, Brazil, South Africa and South Korea (this year's G20 co-chair)-- likely have little time for the charity narrative alone (where rich countries send money to help poor countries) when their own growth engines are fuelled by innovation.</p>
<p>China has produced one of the first H1N1 vaccines on the market this year through a company called Sinovac. India has developed affordable insulin manufactured by a company called Biocon, an affordable hepatitis vaccine manufactured by a company called Shantha and affordable cataract care provided though business innovations at Aravind Eye Care. These examples show why G20 members must be engaged through innovation.</p>
<p>In Canada, we have a new model for international aid, based on innovation. Last month, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty launched Grand Challenges Canada, an independent not-for-profit corporation governed by its own Board of Directors, working with Canada's International Development Research Centre and The Canadian Institutes of Health Research, and funded by the Canadian government's Development Innovation Fund at $225-million over five years.</p>
<p>Grand Challenges Canada's commitment is to fund developing world innovators, and, where appropriate, to link them to innovators in Canada. These developing world scientists are on the front lines. Their knowledge and skills will be key to identifying effective long-term solutions.</p>
<p>The Canadian government is test-driving this innovation approach which can provide a model for other G8 and G20 countries' foreign aid, help bridge the G8 and G20 approaches to development and provide a way for different countries to work with each other, and also with foundations and other organizations, to tackle specific global challenges.</p>
<p>As a global community, we can no longer tolerate the unconscionable loss of women and children's lives in the developing world. Both scaling the known and innovating to tackle the unknown are needed to build a better future for women and children -- a future that starts today.</p>

</p>
<p>The Toronto 18 trials wrapped up this week, as the final two accused were found guilty of plotting to commit violence in the name of militant Islam.</p>
<p>Originally, many people assumed the allegations were exaggerated. These were just a bunch of angry young men fantasizing out loud, more stupid than dangerous. In the end, however, it turned out to be the real deal, a textbook example of self-radicalization and homegrown terrorism.</p>
<p>Now that 11 of the original 18 suspects have been convicted, you'd think there would be a sense of relief. Not really. As the Toronto Star reported, focus groups organized by McGill University indicate some 90 per cent of Muslim youth believe the Toronto terrorism case was a government conspiracy, concocted to make Muslims look bad.</p>
<p>It's hard to overstate how depressing this is, even though we've seen it before. The most disheartening event surrounding the 9/11 attack, other than the attack itself, was the mass denial among Muslim communities right here in the West.</p>
<p>The tradition of conspiracy-thinking in the Muslim world is entrenched and quite fascinating. My first exposure to it was back in journalism school at Carleton University. It was 1993, and I was part of a student television crew sent to cover, as a class assignment, an anti-Israel protest outside the Ottawa Congress Centre, where then-Israeli foreign minister Shimon Peres was speaking.</p>
<p>As we walked into the crowd lugging our TV equipment, an Arab demonstrator pointed to our camera and screamed "Mossad!" Other demonstrators, wearing Yasser Arafat-style kafiyas, became very agitated and started jostling us, yelling "Mossad! Mossad!" We showed our university student IDs. The mob grew angrier, convinced the cards were fake.</p>
<p>Now it's true that all cultures have conspiracy industries. Here in the industrialized West, there are people who believe in alien abduction, that pharmaceutical companies orchestrated the H1N1 vaccination campaign, and that Bobby Kennedy killed Marilyn Monroe.</p>
<p>In the West, however, this stuff is relegated to the fringe. Conversely, the culture of conspiracy in the Arab and Muslim world is mainstream, promoted in mass-circulation media and by influential intellectual, religious and political leaders.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the daily Iranian newspaper Jomhouri-ye Eslami reported that the Taliban and al-Qaeda are secret arms of the U.S. government. Whenever the Americans want to justify imperial aggression, they simply order up another "terror" attack from their ally Osama bin Laden. Another daily Iranian newspaper, Kayhan, reported that the U.S. and Israel used secret technology to trigger the Haiti earthquake, to provide an excuse for western governments to station troops in Haiti and destabilize nearby Cuba and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Last month, a prominent Pakistani columnist wrote in the Peshawar daily Frontier Post that the attempted bombing in Times Square was actually a CIA-Mossad plot. The purpose? To provide an excuse for the U.S. to attack and invade Pakistan.</p>
<p>Just this month, the head of the Palestinian Writers' Union in Gaza, Abu Al-Subh, published a series of articles explaining how Jews are planning to take over the planet by brainwashing future leaders and corrupting the education systems of countries around the world. Al-Subh is an important figure not just because he heads up the writers' union, but also because he has also served as culture minister in the Hamas government.</p>
<p>The above examples come courtesy of the Middle East Media Research Institute, an invaluable organization that provides English translations of what is being said in the mainstream Arab and Muslim press -- again, not the fringe, but mainstream. (If you check it out at memri.org, you'll see that it translates liberal and moderate Muslim voices, too, where it can find them.)</p>
<p>So why has a culture of conspiracy and paranoia come to be institutionalized in the Muslim Middle East? There is a growing academic literature on the subject, but two principal explanations stand out.</p>
<p>One is that conspiracy theories are a tool by which illiberal Muslim leaders preserve power. Conspiracy theories allow corrupt autocrats to deflect criticism and blame outsiders -- Zionists, the CIA and so on --for all the poverty, illiteracy and suffering in their own mismanaged societies.</p>
<p>The second explanation is that Muslims willingly embrace conspiracist thinking as a collective defence mechanism, a way of rationalizing the gap in human development between the West and Islam.</p>
<p>In many Muslim societies, honour is paramount. The collision between Islam and modernity has led to chronic underachievement in the Muslim world, and that, some scholars say, is a profound humiliation. Conspiracy theories help ease the shame, by explaining how Islam, once a glorious empire, came to this sorry state.</p>
<p>Conspiracist thinking is a symptom of total dysfunction. An obsession for external enemies, especially invented ones, means there will never be an imperative to look for the real enemies within, and to embrace the long, painful reforms that ultimately must begin at home.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>McGuinty approved secret powers; New rules that grant summit police sweeping authority are decried as 'police state regulations'</b>
</div><div>David Rider, Robert Benzie, Rob Ferguson  and Robyn Doolittle  Toronto Star   </div>
<div>852 words</div><div>26 June 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty denies it was an abuse of power for his government to secretly approve sweeping new powers for police.</p>
<p>"I just think it's in keeping with the values and standards of Ontarians," McGuinty told the Star on Friday amid a battery of complaints from opposition parties, city councillors, civil libertarians and regular Torontonians that the new rules were kept secret and, some say, may go too far.</p>
<p>The rules allow police to arrest and potentially jail anyone refusing to produce identification or be searched within five metres of the G20 security zone.</p>
<p>"Most Ontarians understand that there's something extraordinary happening inside our province," the Premier said.</p>
<p>"We've tried to limit the intrusiveness to a specific secure zone as much as we can by working together with our police."</p>
<p>McGuinty acknowledged he was in on the cabinet decision to approve the regulation.</p>
<p>A city hall source said Toronto Mayor David Miller was blindsided by a front-page Star story about the regulation passed at the request of police Chief Bill Blair. An unhappy Miller and Blair - normally close allies - later had a brief conversation about it and Miller refused interview requests from the Star.</p>
<p>And nine councillors and mayoral candidates canvassed Friday unanimously said Torontonians should have been told loud and clear their rights had changed. All but one said there was no doubt it was incumbent on Blair to consult, or at least inform, Miller.</p>
<p>"These are police state regulations - we fought wars to protect freedoms like these," thundered Councillor Howard Moscoe.</p>
<p>"Yes, (Blair) should have made the change public. Not everyone carries ID and they have a right to know if they're breaking the law by going near a fence."</p>
<p>At Queen's Park, NDP justice critic and lawyer Peter Kormos said: "This law was not only passed in secret, it was kept secret.</p>
<p>"This is the stuff Kafka wrote novels about. Secret laws that the citizenry is not aware of are the hallmarks of tin pot dictatorships."</p>
<p>The measure, carrying a penalty of up to two months in jail or a $500 fine upon conviction, was revealed after a 31-year-old York University master's student refused to show identification near the fence and was arrested based on a regulation few knew existed. He was held for five hours in a pen at a temporary holding centre on Eastern Ave.</p>
<p>Seeking to calm the uproar, Blair held a news conference Friday defending his request. And he insisted posting the change on a government website was enough notice. "Several months ago we spoke to the province of Ontario regarding that area which will be fenced off. We were seeking clarification of the authorities that the police would require to restrict people's access ... We wanted to ensure there was a core articulation of those authorities," Blair, appearing uncharacteristically anxious, told reporters.</p>
<p>"It was not a secret. It was passed in exactly the procedure that is described in our legislation ... It was published on e-laws, June 16, 2010. Most lawyers actually pay attention to that," said Blair. "We are not seeking extraordinary powers to arrest our citizens. We are only seeking an authority, a clear authority, to enable us to maintain a secure perimeter."</p>
<p>Blair requested in May that "guards" appointed under Ontario's Public Works Protection Act be temporarily given the power to arrest anyone who, in specific areas, comes within five metres of the security zone.</p>
<p>Lawyer Julian Falconer speculates that Blair likely anticipated backlash over the secrecy, but knew if they came out publicly, it would likely have been overturned before the G20.</p>
<p>"The inescapable inference of the secret methods used to pass this legislation is that they knew it was vulnerable to constitutional challenge," he said. "This is brand new in our world. I've never seen this in all of my years as a human rights lawyer and it's disturbing."</p>
<p>The law was approved June 2 through an order-in-council, with no debate in the Legislature, after being discussed by the legislation and regulations committee of McGuinty's cabinet. The regulatory amendment was quietly posted June 16 on the government's e-laws website.</p>
<p>On June 2, the government put out four news releases touting stronger protection of retirement home residents, announcing some new deputy ministers, boasting about the province's response to last year's H1N1 pandemic, and disclosing $2 million in funding for public libraries.</p>
<p>But there was nary a word from the province's massive communications' machine on a sweeping change to civil liberties in downtown Toronto.</p>
<p>Community Safety Minister Rick Bartolucci insists standard protocol was followed on the regulation because it was posted online within two weeks after its passage.</p>
<p>"This is customary for regulations," Bartolucci said in an interview. "There's no secrecy attached to this at all."</p>
<p>Stuart Green, Mayor Miller's spokesman, confirmed Friday that Blair did not consult Miller.</p>

</p>
<p>My assignment: challenge the fence. Thirty seconds after locking my bicycle in front of Metro Hall on John St., I strolled past a few dozen police officers into the red zone. It was silent except for chirping birds and the distant squeal of the King streetcar.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Star uncovered a secret law that enabled officers to arrest anyone within five metres of the G20 security zone who refused to produce identification or submit to a police search. I didn't produce identification nor was I searched. So I kept walking with my point-and-shoot camera in hand. I had been instructed to provide identification if asked - getting arrested wasn't part of the assignment.</p>
<p>We summit reporters were advised to avoid dressing like protesters - or the mainstream media. I wore a white-collared tennis shirt, black surf shorts and off-white Converse. I still stood out because police greatly outnumbered civilians in the red zone. I wove my way through the security area for 45 minutes, snapping pictures, before I was finally stopped. I had just taken a picture of six officers standing in front of the Royal York hotel.</p>
<p>"Sir," came a voice from behind. "Sir."</p>
<p>"Yes," I said, turning around.</p>
<p>"I noticed you've been taking a lot of pictures," the Halton Region officer said. I told him I was with the press. He asked for ID.</p>
<p>Uh-oh. Due to an administrative error, I do not have an official G20 pass - just my driver's licence and a laminated Star media pass.</p>
<p>I gave him my identification, just as a photographer walked by with two cameras over his shoulders. The officer spelled my name into his walkie-talkie, then rummaged through my bag, which contained another camera, a voice recorder, pens and notepads. He didn't find my vinegar-soaked bandana (an antidote in case of a tear gas attack).</p>
<p>"Am I not supposed to be here?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No, you are," he said.</p>
<p>"When does the fence close?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I thought it was supposed to be closed by now," he said. His radio crackled; he responded with a "10-4" and returned my ID.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, over at Front and John Sts., I was stopped a second time. Two officers questioned me. One took my licence and filled out a card, including my height and weight. The second officer peppered me with questions.</p>
<p>"When you're covering the protests for the Star, do you ever participate in them?" the officer asked.</p>
<p>"Um, no," I said, wondering if that was a trick question.</p>
<p>"Hey, Casey," a voice yelled from the street, "Officer, check that man's bag thoroughly!"</p>
<p>It was a friend - a Toronto police sergeant. "No, no, he's okay. I'm just joking," he yelled from a burgundy minivan. (He's part of a mobile response unit.)</p>
<p>I draped my large camera around my neck and snaked through what could accurately be called a dead zone except for scores of police officers. At Front and Simcoe Sts. I came across the only protester I found within the security zone.</p>
<p>Abdul Adam, a Toronto financial adviser, was carrying a sign detailing a lengthy protest over the H1N1 vaccine. He blames the death of his 5-year-old daughter, Amina Abudu, on the vaccine. He said he had no problem with police.</p>
<p>"This is a peaceful protest 'cause my daughter died peacefully," Adam said, wiping tears away.</p>
<p>I headed south to the Steam Whistle brewery - more employees than patrons. Then to Lake Shore Blvd. and the southern perimeter.</p>
<p>An officer, who wished to remain anonymous, gave me a tour of that area. He checked all the fire hydrants we passed. Apparently some time last week persons unknown has loosened the giant side screws on several fire hydrants. These heavy screws could be used as projectiles, the officer said.</p>
<p>The officer also told me they would remove bicycles from bike racks near the security fence. Bicycles had been thrown under police horses' feet during the Queen's Park riot in 2000.</p>
<p>I headed back to Metro Hall. My bike was still there, along with dozens of others. I rode back through the security zone and was stopped once more. That made it just three searches between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Not bad for a police state.</p>
<p>But things will be utterly different now that the fence has closed.</p>
<p>Police outside the Royal York hotel questioned Star reporter Liam Casey about the photos he was taking.

<p>mwente@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Motherhood came easily to my mom. She popped out the three of us, as reliably as toast, every other year. But by modern standards she was a mediocre parent. She smoked. She drank. She drove us around without seatbelts, while she smoked. After I turned 10, she often left the three of us at home, unsupervised, for hours at a time. (She figured I was smart enough to call a neighbour if the house burned down.) We raced around without bike helmets, and made our way to school on our own. We never wore sunscreen except at the beach.</p>
<p>Apart from the violin (which, to everyone's relief, I quickly abandoned), we had little in the way of extracurricular enrichment. In summer, we hung around and did nothing. During the long summer evenings, my parents would sit around in the backyard with their friends, smoking and drinking to excess, while we ran wild through wooded vacant lots and hazardous construction sites. One time, when I was around 8, my mom allowed me to go to a Cubs game in the company of the friendly school bus driver (!!!). It's amazing we lived to adulthood.</p>
<p>Times were simpler then. Nobody had heard of child abuse or BPA. Mothers used cloth diapers, not because they were environmentally responsible, but because Pampers hadn't been invented yet. Peanut allergies were virtually unknown, and breastfeeding was regarded as faintly backward.</p>
<p>Now we know better. The obligations of responsible mothering have been ratcheted way up. They start before conception, when you must swear off alcohol and tobacco so as not to harm your hypothetical embryo. Abstinence from all things, including ice cream (you can't gain too much weight!) extends through pregnancy. Natural childbirth? Of course, preferably at home. Epidurals are for losers.</p>
<p>And then the real work starts. The modern world is full of invisible threats, from toxic plastic to UVA. Vaccines and cellphones are supposed to be safe, but who knows? Last fall, vigilant mothers I know spent hours on the Internet, researching the ins and outs of the H1N1 vaccine, and quarantining their kids from contact with anyone who'd had contact with someone who might have had the flu. They don't trust experts and they take these matters seriously. As The Globe and Mail's Siri Agrell wrote recently in Toronto Life (Totally Freaked Out, March), “A generation of moms and dads has taken a purity pledge for their kids. You can't throw an organic terry cloth teething ring today without hitting a parent obsessing over pesticides on apples and phthalates in soothers.”</p>
<p>Every generation of mothers is buffeted by different waves of social panic. Ten years ago, it was child abuse – the fear that dangerous pedophiles lurked in every bush. Consequently, middle-class kids now live in a world where no child is left alone, not even for a moment. Now, we are afraid of anything that isn't chemical-free. Conscientious moms scrub down the kitchen with green cleaners (which aren't nearly as effective as the hard-core stuff), and hang their washing out to dry to save the planet. I see some of them at Whole Foods, filling up at the quinoa bin, towing tots armoured in hats, sunglasses, and SPF 100 sunscreen.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, the conveniences of modern life (processed foods, Lysol spray, disposable diapers, clothes dryers, polyester sheets) liberated women like my mother from their chains. But now, their granddaughters are clamouring to clap the shackles on again. Someone's got to mash the organic applesauce, hang the diapers out to dry, and breastfeed the kid. No matter how enlightened the parental units, that someone will generally be Mom.</p>
<p>It seems to me that if you had deliberately devised a plot to oppress women, it couldn't get more diabolical than this. Highly educated, progressive and enlightened mothers don't need men to oppress them. They're perfectly capable of oppressing themselves!</p>
<p>Today, the baby has become “the best ally of masculine domination,” argues Elisabeth Badinter, a controversial French feminist. Her new book (Le Conflit: La Femme et La Mère, translated as Conflict: The Woman and the Mother) argues that the moral requirements of modern motherhood – especially the back-to-nature, eco-mommy trend – have struck a blow to women's freedom. “Women's lives have grown more difficult in the last 20 years,” she told The New York Times. “Professional life is ever harder, ever more stressful and unattractive, and on the other hand, there is an accumulation of new moral duties weighing on women.”</p>
<p>The new ethic of mothering promises that you will find wisdom, happiness, and connectedness, not only with your children but with the earth itself. Instead, what you mostly get is guilt. So you fed your kids fast food last week? Bad mommy!</p>
<p>Ms. Badinter contends that there is nothing wrong with being a mediocre mother. She was one herself. Natural childbirth, she says, is highly overrated, as is breastfeeding, which doesn't always produce that mystical bond that it's supposed to. She has even argued that the maternal instinct does not exist, citing long periods of French history during which women were generally indifferent to their children.</p>
<p>I'm not sure about that (although I am sure it's not nearly as common or intense as we suppose.) But it occurs to me that the high moral bar we've set for modern motherhood is a tremendous deterrent to motherhood itself. Any thoughtful woman would have to think twice, thrice, or three times thrice before committing to a task with such demanding standards. Can you blame them for deciding not to? If we want to raise the birth rate, perhaps we need to lower the bar. So long as you keep the kids from running out into the traffic, they'll probably be fine. It seemed to work for Mom.</p>

</p>
<p>Though it has treated patients for months and is still incomplete, the East Edmonton Health Centre officially opened on Thursday.</p>
<p>When the doors to the new centre opened late last year, there was no time for ceremony because of the H1N1 vaccination drive.</p>
<p>The centre, at 79th Street and 112th Avenue, is a multi-service facility, with home care, social services, dental, speech and language programs, communicable disease programs and addictions services.</p>
<p>However, a planned urgent care centre and six family physicians have yet to be added, with no solid deadline or timetable in sight.</p>
<p>Marianne Stewart, vice-president, Edmonton Zone, for Alberta Health Services, said those departments will definitely be added.</p>
<p>"You always have to look at the plan, and no one has ever wavered on what the plan is going to be. We knew we would be opening some services first, and we were uncertain when we could bring in the urgent care and family medicine. Now we can start to think at what point are we going to have the resources to open it operationally."</p>
<p>Both Alberta Health and Wellness Minister Gene Zwozdesky and Alberta Health Services CEO Dr. Stephen Duckett said the facility will be completed.</p>
<p>Zwozdesky echoed Stewart when he said the centre was meant to open in stages. He added that he hoped the facility would be expanded "within a year or two."</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason, who also represents the riding where the centre is located, said the original plan is being delayed.</p>
<p>"I was involved with this project, working with the community to sign on with the project and the intention was always to have an urgent care facility, and to bring doctors and specialists into the neighbourhood. That was always part of the plan, but it's been held back because of the government not following through on their funding commitment."</p>
<p>The urgent-care facility, expected to provide emergency medical services without the beds of an emergency room, was supposed to relieve some congestion at the Royal Alexandra Hospital and reduce waiting times.</p>
<p>The family physicians were seen as important to the area because it is home to more than 7,000 seniors and 9,000 students.</p>
<p>The centre cost $44 million. Urgent care and family medicine would need an estimated $8.4 million a year to operate.</p>

</p>
<p>From making our national anthem accessible to more people, to fighting stigmas about sexuality, Calgary's seniors continue to impress with the depth of their contributions.</p>
<p>Nowhere was this more apparent than during two recent award ceremonies.</p>
<p>The 2010 Outstanding Calgary Seniors Awards recognized dozens of nominees in six categories, with one from each category receiving full honours.</p>
<p>All accomplishments had to take place after nominees turned 65.</p>
<p>Ella O'Donnell was honoured in the volunteerism category for her work with the Royal Canadian Legion Auxiliary, Rosedale Hospice, Col. Belcher Care Centre, Tom Baker Cancer Centre and other organizations. She has also offered her services at H1N1 flu clinics.</p>
<p>"It's all part of giving back," she says.</p>
<p>"I'm a cancer survivor, so I figure I got a second chance at life. I wouldn't trade the opportunity for all the money in the bank."</p>
<p>Shamsher Singh Sandhu says he didn't start learning to write poetry until after he turned 65.</p>
<p>"I learned after 65 how to type on the computer -- how to publish books, yourself -- and I did all the selling of my books, myself," says the recipient of the arts category honour.</p>
<p>He's self-published six collections of his works so far, with a seventh in preparation. But he is most proud of his work in translating Alberta's Song and O Canada into Punjabi, with his O Canada translation now in Library and Archives Canada's collection.</p>
<p>"Just being in Canada is not enough," says Sandhu. "The most important thing is to have a sense of belonging. I wanted to get a message to people who came from Punjab and (elsewhere in) India that if you've adopted this country and this country has adopted you, this is your national anthem."</p>
<p>The awards honoured self-sacrifice and caring for others in the Caregiving category.</p>
<p>Gerda Wlodarczak was recognized for her untiring devotion in taking care of her adult son, Joachim.</p>
<p>"My son had a lack of oxygen at birth and was supposed to be in an institution," says Wlodarczak, who came to Canada from Germany in 1955. "After my husband passed away, I relocated to Calgary and started a completely new life, and I had my son with me."</p>
<p>Dalut Janmohamed won the general category for her work as a volunteer case manager with the Quality of Life Improvement Program, which aids families dealing with poverty and other life challenges.</p>
<p>She also has volunteered with the Taradale Co-op Food Bank Drive and helps students at Chris Akkerman School.</p>
<p>"This is to be a role model -- spread the word and tell others: 'You go for it'," she says of the importance of these awards.</p>
<p>Janmohamed, whose husband, Sadrudin, was a nominee in the leadership category this year, says she enjoys being able to help others, such as a refugee family from Afghanistan she assisted through the Quality of Life program.</p>
<p>Marilyn Truscott was recognized in the active living category for work that includes paddling with the Dragonhearts, hiking the Chilkoot Trail, kayaking Pacific Rim National Park and cycling on behalf of the B.C. Lung Association.</p>
<p>"I think as a senior you have more time to do these leisure activities, which is a bonus," she says. "I've always been interested in sports, and I like to sing -- there are always so many things to do."</p>
<p>George Hopkins took home the leadership category award for his work with projects such as Seniors A GOGO (Growing Older, Getting it On), which partnered with the Foundation Lab and Calgary Sexual Health Centre to promote open discussion of sexuality issues in seniors.</p>
<p>"It's a series of monologues that we do," says Hopkins, a founding member of the Seniors Action Group.</p>
<p>"So many people think sexuality is just sex, but when you get to be a senior, sex is a small part of sexuality. It's how you feel about yourself and how you feel about other people."</p>
<p>Seniors have a tendency to not be acknowledged as much as they should be, says Glenn Skimming, incoming president of the Calgary Chapter Alberta Association on Gerontology, which has organized and co-sponsored the awards since 2005.</p>
<p>"To be able to honour them really brings to attention the work seniors do as they age. They may have been just as busy when they were younger, but they're continuing to be involved in the community."</p>
<p>The awards' planning committee, as well as the program's judges, are each seniors themselves.</p>
<p>This year, one member of the committee was herself honoured at the Minister's Seniors Service Awards, which were presented at Government House in Edmonton a few days before the Calgary celebration.</p>
<p>Mary Bereziuk was honoured for her work with the Ukrainian Assumption Seniors Club, where she's been president for 21 years, and for assisting seniors whose first language isn't English. Her work with the Alberta Association on Gerontology was also recognized.</p>
<p>"Most of our members came to Canada after the war," she says.</p>
<p>"They had labourer jobs and their recreation was things like working on their gardens. When we formed the club, we started weekly bingos, trips, wine and cheese parties, and New Year's Eve parties."</p>
<p>Bereziuk, who received an Outstanding Calgary Seniors Award last year, says her club also supports important causes, such as the food bank and War Amps, and donated $500 for Haitian earthquake relief efforts.</p>
<p>Anne Hartley of Okotoks, a longtime Kerby Centre volunteer with more than 20,000 hours of service, was honoured by the province for her work with Kerby and for raising awareness of financial abuse of seniors.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ten years and counting; Chubb Insurance and PCL Constructors lead best employers list for a decade</b>
</div><div>Madhavi Acharya-Tom Yew Toronto Star    </div>
<div>871 words</div><div>19 June 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>M1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>Employee-ownership, paid time-off for volunteer work, continuing education and communication are the ingredients that have kept two very different Toronto companies - <span class="companylink">Chubb Insurance Co. of Canada</span> and <span class="companylink">PCL Constructors Inc</span>.- perched on the list of the best employers in the Greater Toronto Area for a decade.</p>
<p>"Keeping our employees engaged allows us to retain the best in the business," says Ellen Moore, chair, president and chief executive officer of <span class="companylink">Chubb Insurance</span>. "Staff spend the vast majority of their weeks and months and years with us, so if they're not coming to work with the right frame of mind, we're going to lose a fair amount of productivity and valuable resourcing.</p>
<p>"It's critical for us to have the staff know that we take their feedback seriously. It's our commitment to the staff that we truly can't get the job done without them."</p>
<p>That commitment even includes the company's quarterly town hall meeting with its 450 staff across Canada.</p>
<p>Each meeting includes information about Chubb's business performance, but also highlights community service work and individual achievement.</p>
<p>Chubb takes the time to give updates on pressing issues of the day, whether it's the financial crisis, the H1N1 pandemic or the upcoming G20 summit.</p>
<p>Including as many staff members as possible, and as painlessly as possible, is a priority and that's why they use video conferencing.</p>
<p>"We used to do them at 9 a.m. in Toronto and now we do them at 11 a.m. so that each office can roll in on their own time frame. It feels more like a community of staff when we can include them," Moore says.</p>
<p>"They told us this is what they would like. We tried it a couple of years ago but the technology wasn't quite there so we said let's try it again. Now we get better and better at it each quarter."</p>
<p>A few years ago, Chubb introduced paid time off for volunteer work for employees in good standing. Staff have taken up the call, and volunteer on a range of causes from palliative care to building homes with Habitat for Humanity.</p>
<p>"It shows our staff that we believe there's power in community activism and we want you to do it," she says.</p>
<p>Moore concedes that time is given on an honour system basis. "There's a level of trust and respect that we have for each other that is fundamental. If we run the risk of one individual perhaps gaming the system, they're probably doing other things we're not happy with and we'll find out over time. But that shouldn't abrogate a great program for the rest of the staff."</p>
<p>These programs and spending on employee communication have been a priority even through the recession, Moore says. "It's a little myopic of business leaders to pull back on that spending in tough times because that's when you need employees to really feel empowered in their workplace."</p>
<p>"We're not without resource constraints. Our organization has had a flat expense mandate for the last number of years so we reach pretty deep to make sure people are still well compensated."</p>
<p>PCL, in business for 104 years in Canada, has worked on some of the biggest construction projects in Toronto, including Scotia Plaza, BCE Place (now Brookfield Place), the Air Canada Centre, BMO Field, and the Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts.</p>
<p>The high-profile projects serve as a powerful calling card to potential top employees.</p>
<p>"Our business is all about people," says Jim Dougan, president, central and eastern Canadian buildings. "People build buildings, not companies. If you don't have the best people, our business won't be successful."</p>
<p>PCL is 100 per cent employee owned - it has nearly 3,200 employee shareholders.</p>
<p>"It's very much a family in terms of supporting each other. We are all shareholders and we recognize that we all have to work together, and if we can succeed individually we will succeed collectively," Dougan says.</p>
<p>Over the years, it has racked up accolades and awards for its safety record, its commitment to being environmentally friendly, and community spirit.</p>
<p>This year, it also came in as Canada's Best Managed company.</p>
<p>The Canadian company has 27 offices in North America, is the biggest contractor in Canada and seventh largest in North America.</p>
<p>Dougan points to the company's focus on continuing education as part of what keep employees so engaged. Each year, all employees are required to achieve 40 hours at the PCL College of Construction.</p>
<p>"It's all part of their career development, how they can advance in the company. It keeps people growing and very engaged in what we're doing," Dougan says.</p>
<p>Similar to Chubb, employees can receive paid time off for volunteer work and regular communication with staff is a priority. "They're all shareholders so they need to know where we're going and how we're doing," Dougan says.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rain can't dampen Ex-citement - 59th annual event endures a soggy start, but the best is yet to come</b>
</div><div>By Geoff Kirbyson    </div>
<div>525 words</div><div>19 June 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Do you want to get wetter?</p>
<p>That may as well have been the tag line for the man on the microphone at the Polar Express ride -- replacing the iconic "do you want to go faster? -- as the 59th annual Red River Exhibition got underway Friday afternoon under a combination of drizzle, rain and a torrential downpour.</p>
<p>"It's like when you wake up in the middle of the night sweating from a nightmare," said Garth Rogerson, CEO of the Red River Exhibition Association, with a laugh. "You never like to see rain but for a 10-day event in the spring, it's not whether you'll get rain but how many rainy days you'll get."</p>
<p>Rogerson recommended fair-goers, when the weather's not fair, try out Niagara Falls, a simulated log ride that takes thrill-seekers down two falls.</p>
<p>"You go there and get wet anyway," he said.</p>
<p>That was certainly Leo Snaefeld Pallsson's strategy. The 13-year-old, who was in town from Iceland this week on a trip with his school choir, was oblivious to the precipitation.</p>
<p>"We came here to have the best fun ever," he said, noting he was the only boy among his 21 fellow singers. He said the Niagara Falls was his favourite part of the trip -- he never had to wait in line all afternoon -- even eclipsing a visit to Gimli.</p>
<p>"I want to move here. We went to Boston Pizza four days in a row," he said.</p>
<p>Many games-of-chance operators and vendors wore rain ponchos and talked among themselves as the weather kept all but the most hardy away. Darren Raeside was philosophical about the rain as he stood in front of the Raeside Concessions booth, which had Spider-Man inflatable toys and novelties as well as umbrellas on display.</p>
<p>"It's a day to get the kinks out. One day of rain isn't too big a deal," he said.</p>
<p>Despite the soggy start, Rogerson is optimistic attendance this year will shatter not only last year's total of 181,345 but the all-time record of 197,000 set about a decade ago.</p>
<p>"We had so many things going against us last year. There was H1N1 and the (poor) economy. We should see 200,000 people this year," he said.</p>
<p>The Ex runs until June 27.</p>
<p>geoff.kirbyson@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>By the numbers:</p>
<p>20,000 -- the number of people who can go on all the fair's rides in an hour.</p>
<p>40,000 -- the one-day attendance record set June 20, 2009.</p>
<p>51,000 -- the number off litres of fuel to run the rides that can't be powered by electricity for 10 days.</p>
<p>$152 -- the amount spent by an average group during a single visit.</p>
<p>167,709 -- the number of mini-doughnuts consumed annually.</p>
<p>611 -- the number of ride inspections.</p>
<p>277,377 -- the number of "whack-a-moles" whacked every year.</p>
<p>116,178 -- the number of splashes on the Niagara Falls water ride.</p>

<p>The recent contract settlement with the 11,000 publicly paid nurses reveals the sleight of hand, deficit-budgeting scheme that makes a lie of the Selinger government's tough talk on civil servant salaries. After repeated warnings that publicly paid employees would have to agree to a two-year wage freeze "or else," the government this year will give nurses a two per cent, lump-sum payment.</p>
<p>How can a government that will rack up more than $2 billion in deficits in five years reconcile that with a promise to spread the pain among public salaries for two years? Easy, says Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk. She tucked money away under a different shell. That shell was last year's budget, where the finance minister conveniently stored $21.2 million for a lump-sum deal with nurses.</p>
<p>There were more goodies for the nurses, whose union -- conveniently, again, for the NDP governing party -- ran advertisements about the oh-so-happy state of public health care shortly before the 2007 election campaign. The Selinger government has agreed to help top up the nurses' pension fund, damaged by the recessionary stock market, and to begin contributing in 2014 to a new fund that will give cost-of-living raises to pensions as of 2018. Further, in the third year of the collective agreement, veteran nurses will get a top-up of two per cent and all nurses will see wages rise by four per cent. Manitoba nurses become among the best paid in Canada.</p>
<p>The deficit the province amassed in 2009/10 was blamed upon the global economic slump, which barely nicked Manitoba's finances, and "extraordinary" costs such as the expense of fighting H1N1. Premier Greg Selinger, who served as finance minister for much of 2009, never mentioned to the taxpayer that money was being secretly hived off for a yet-to-be negotiated contract with the powerful union.</p>
<p>How much more cash lies around in secreted kitties? The public has a right to feel hoodwinked and betrayed by the government's claim to careful management of the province's finances in these "unavoidable" deficit-funding years. The tough talk of forcing publicly paid employees -- up next: 13,500 civil servants -- into wage freezes or job reductions or forced unpaid days off, for the next two years is hollow and fraudulent, a sleight of hand by a government indebted to unions for its tenure in office.</p>

<p>Those annoying notices seem to be everywhere these days, telling us to wash our hands and stop the spread of germs. We can't enter a store or a school or a ferry, it seems, without seeing a handy dispenser that will help us avoid picking up or passing on a nasty bug.</p>
<p>It's like Big Brother is watching us -- except today's Big Brother is dressed in medical garb and is repeating the things we learned from our parents and teachers.</p>
<p>It all seems silly, because everyone knows about handwashing, right?</p>
<p>Apparently not. And to make matters worse, it turns out that some of the biggest offenders are people who should know better, because they have been trained in the ways of preventing the spread of disease.</p>
<p>They are physicians working on Vancouver Island. The Vancouver Island Health Authority has audited the hospital handwashing rate, of all things, and found that just</p>
<p>18 per cent of doctors washed their hands when visiting a patient. About 30 per cent of all health-care workers washed their hands.</p>
<p>At Saanich Peninsula Hospital, only eight per cent of staff complied with the hand-hygiene protocols. Compliance was higher at Victoria General Hospital and Royal Jubilee Hospital, but still, at least 60 per cent of the people working in local hospitals do not take one of the easiest steps to reduce the spread of disease.</p>
<p>VIHA's head of patient safety describes results like that as "disappointing" and "unacceptable."</p>
<p>It is hard to understand the reluctance of health-care professionals to practise one of the most important ways of reducing the spread of disease. The past year has seen the H1N1 influenza scare and serious outbreaks of disease in Nanaimo and Victoria hospitals.</p>
<p>If the people who deal with illness every day don't see the need for keeping their hands clean, they cannot be expected to lead the rest of us -- the great unwashed, one might say -- to a higher level of awareness.</p>
<p>Simple handwashing can keep us out of the sick bay and keep health-care costs down. Doctors know that. It's time for them to put that knowledge to good use.</p>

<div>Issues & Ideas</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Health care cuts are counterproductive; Instead of redirecting existing funding, Victoria should be expanding the infrastructure for public health</b>
</div><div>John Blatherwick   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>785 words</div><div>17 June 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The B.C. Ministry of Health Services has recently asked health authorities to identify at least a 10-percent portion of their public health budgets to be redirected toward priorities to be identified by Victoria. This is contrary to the recognition following the SARS crisis that Canada's public health infrastructure needs to be expanded. Rather than reduce funding to current core programs, the minister should focus on introducing healthy public policies that promote health and prevent disease, which can markedly contribute to a healthier British Columbia.</p>
<p>Currently, only three per cent of the B.C. health care budget is directed toward public health, prevention efforts -an amount already considered inadequate to produce significant prevention results. Promoting the health of the public and preventing disease lacks the glamour of many health interventions and rarely makes headlines until there are serious threats to population health. The critical work of public health includes a number of broad initiatives that immunize kids, ensure a safe food supply, reduce tobacco use and support families in creating healthy lifestyles. These initiatives have proven to be cost effective in promoting health and preventing disease.</p>
<p>Moving around existing public health prevention resources will not necessarily improve the health of British Columbians in a dramatic way. Instead of redirecting existing funds toward untested programs or media campaigns, the Health Minister Kevin Falcon should introduce, advocate for and support healthy public policies (such as those below) that have the potential to produce significant results in overall improved health of British Columbians.</p>
<p>(1) A comprehensive poverty reduction legislation, as in other jurisdictions in Canada, which includes a detailed and accountable strategy with concrete and legislated targets and timelines to dramatically reduce homelessness and poverty in our province. Poverty is one of the most powerful determinants of health. People on low income suffer more chronic illness, and poor children in particular begin to develop health issues that will challenge them throughout their lives. There is an incredible amount of consensus across the country that there is a way to achieve reductions in poverty and long-term improvements in health. A comprehensive strategy would include:</p>
<p>- Adequate and accessible income support for the non-employed;</p>
<p>- Improved earnings and working conditions of those in the low-wage workforce;</p>
<p>- A plan for affordable housing and supportive housing in B.C.;</p>
<p>- Promoting early childhood development through the provision of universal publicly funded child care.</p>
<p>(2) Policy actions that address chronic disease through the creation of supportive environments in communities. Policies that make healthy choices the easy choices for families and individuals include:</p>
<p>- Provincial leadership in securing federal/provincial policies with respect to food composition (e. g., reduce the salt in processed foods and sugar in beverages);</p>
<p>- Provincial support for unambiguous labelling of healthy choices on chain restaurant menus;</p>
<p>- Provincial initiatives that improve literacy and health literacy, especially for new immigrant and refugee populations;</p>
<p>- Promote, protect and support breastfeeding in B.C. by implementing baby-friendly hospitals, workplaces and communities;</p>
<p>- Support for low-income families to access sport and recreation opportunities.</p>
<p>A health care system that treats illness instead of promoting health is unsustainable and costly. The government's own Standing Committee on Health report on childhood obesity calls for an increase of the budget to six per cent for public health initiatives. If we can continue to find millions for sickness care, we should be able to find the small amount needed to increase prevention to six per cent of the health care budget. Have we forgotten the lesson of SARS, the Walkerton E. coli outbreak, the recent H1N1 response and the overwhelming effectiveness of our immunization program, to cite merely a few examples? We should increase the budget and expenditures in public health -- not erode the already scarce resources.</p>
<p>The government and the minster have policy tools available to them that would significantly improve the health of British Columbians to a degree far greater than any re-directed program funding. Implementing these policies would also reduce health inequities that contribute to the poor health status of many of our citizens, which in turn deprives many, particularly young children living in poverty, the opportunity for success, lifelong achievement and good health. These strategies require leadership and action through legislation, regulation, and healthy public policies without raiding the existing public health budget.</p>

<div>1092 words</div><div>17 June 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L1</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>Canada's public health leaders took time out this week to do something they rarely do: celebrate success.</p>
<p>The annual conference of the Canadian Public Health Association was, in part, a 100th birthday party. It was an occasion to look at the triumphs of the past century, of which there are an astonishing number.</p>
<p>The CPHA published an e-book, This is Public Health: A Canadian History (available free at www.cpha100.ca[http://www.cpha100.ca]) and produced a list of the 12 greatest public health achievements of the past 100 years.</p>
<p>The paradox of public health is that when it is effective it is invisible.</p>
<p>Virtually all the successes on the list are things we take for granted: the disease-sparing benefits of vaccination, food safety, safe childbirth, contraception and so on.</p>
<p>Yet each has had a profound effect on society and on our collective health. Since the CPHA was formed in 1910, life expectancy in Canada has climbed to over 80 from barely 50. To put it another way, every year a person was born after 1910 added four months to their life.</p>
<p>While medical care has improved dramatically, the vast majority of those gains are due to pretty simple public health measures.</p>
<p>A century ago, rates of child and maternal mortality were sickeningly high. The population was constantly stalked by outbreaks of disease. Unpasteurized milk, inadequately treated water and lack of sewage treatment killed. Many people risked their lives every day they went to work. Disability was a death sentence. Far too many Canadians were beaten down by poverty, particularly seniors. Prior to medicare, an illness could bankrupt a family.</p>
<p>To its credit, however, the Canadian Public Health Association did not simply look back, but cast its eyes to the challenges that lay ahead.</p>
<p>A century ago, the task was to build sewage systems and water treatment plants.</p>
<p>These were massive infrastructure investments that have paid off in spades.</p>
<p>Today, the challenge is to move well beyond the dumping of feces and spread of microbes and to clean up the environment even more broadly.</p>
<p>Some of the most pressing issues for public health circa 2010 are to cap gushing oil wells (and reduce the damaging effects of fossil fuels generally), to put an end to massive deforestation and to slow (or reverse) global warming.</p>
<p>“In 100 years, when we look back, we will be judged by how well we adapted to our changing environment,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, told delegates.</p>
<p>The environment has become one of the primary concerns of public health in the 21st century: not only the natural environment, but the built environment too.</p>
<p>The fact that 90 per cent of the population now lives in cities has a tremendous impact on health and that should be reflected in public health priorities.</p>
<p>So too should the modern workplace. While workplaces are much safer today than they were in 1910, it is debatable whether they are actually healthier. Chemicals are not the sole source of toxicity: Overwork can be deadly, and loss of work-life balance broadly damaging.</p>
<p>While infectious diseases do a lot less damage than they used to – at least in wealthy countries like Canada – there are always new ones, from HIV-AIDS to SARS to H1N1.</p>
<p>And immunization, despite its astounding benefits, remains a tough sell. A century ago, anti-vaccinationists torched the house of Canada's Chief Vaccinator; today, they do their damage online by spreading falsehoods and sowing fear.</p>
<p>This serves as a reminder that: 1) progress cannot be taken for granted and; 2) effective communication remains primary for successful public health initiatives.</p>
<p>While public health gets a tiny fraction of health dollars – about 4 per cent of spending goes to prevention and health promotion and 96 per cent to sickness care – it has always batted well above its weight.</p>
<p>Public health has always been a voice for the underdog. That is why, during the CPHA conference, much of the discussion was dominated by talk of social determinants of health.</p>
<p>The reality is that the economic and social conditions in which we live – income, housing, education, physical environment and support networks – ultimately have more impact on our health than genetics or lifestyle choices.</p>
<p>The most socially and economically disadvantaged in society have the worst health outcomes – and in Canada that means aboriginal people, immigrants, people with mental and physical disabilities and, to a lesser extent, women.</p>
<p>In Canada, social programs have been used to correct some of those imbalances, one of the principal reasons we have good health outcomes. But in recent years there has been a sharp decline in income-redistribution programs; social assistance has become a dirty word.</p>
<p>Among aboriginal people on reserves, in particular, health circumstances and outcomes are shockingly similar to 1910. It has been a lost century of public health advances for First Nations.</p>
<p>One of the priorities for public health has to be to tackle this national shame. There has been recognition, but now action is required. Doing so will require promoting civic engagement and social solidarity, to create (or recreate) a society in which it's not okay to not care.</p>
<p>After all, as a country, we are only as healthy as the least healthy among us.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>What's been achieved</p>
<p>Vaccination</p>
<p>Once-common killers of children such as polio, smallpox and measles have virtually disappeared.</p>
<p>Acting on social determinants</p>
<p>There is a growing recognition that education, housing and income are keys to health outcomes.</p>
<p>Workplaces</p>
<p>Safety initiatives and greater attention to physical environment has improved the lot of workers.</p>
<p>Cardiovascular health</p>
<p>Changes in diet and investment in prevention have led to sharp declines in death from heart disease and stroke.</p>
<p>Food</p>
<p>Regulation and inspection has dramatically reduced food-borne disease.</p>
<p>Infectious diseases</p>
<p>Epidemics of cholera, typhus and tuberculosis were once common.</p>
<p>Mothers and babies</p>
<p>A century ago, one in seven children died before age 2, and death during childbirth was common.</p>
<p>Family planning</p>
<p>The legalization of birth control and decriminalization of abortion has given women reproductive rights.</p>
<p>Tobacco use</p>
<p>In the 1950s, more than half of adults smoked; today, the figure is less than 1 in 5.</p>
<p>Environment</p>
<p>Air pollution and water pollution are far less common.</p>
<p>Motor vehicles</p>
<p>The rate of road deaths has fallen by more than half since the 1970s through initiatives like seatbelt laws.</p>
<p>Social programs</p>
<p>Medicare, child benefits and old-age pensions have reduced inequities.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wine with your cheesedog? - Red River Ex expands its appeal to Merlot- and midway-lovers alike</b>
</div><div>By Carolin Vesely   </div>

</p>
<p>The dog days of summer are still a ways off, but for the next 10 days you'll be able to get your fill of hotdogs, corn dogs and Extreme Canines stunt dogs as the Red River Exhibition kicks off its 59th season.</p>
<p>If mystery meat and "fur-flying family fun" aren't up your alley, how about noshing on escargot and sipping wine, followed by a stroll through an art exhibit?</p>
<p>"This is the new direction of the Ex, creating those kinds of 'fair' things," says Garth Rogerson, CEO of Red River Exhibition Park, which runs the June 18-27 event.</p>
<p>"You go to some of the biggest fairs in North America and wine-tasting is part of it. It's just something for everybody and that's what we're trying to do here."</p>
<p>In 2009, Red River Ex organizers launched a five-year plan to "put the exhibit back in exhibition" and thus make Manitoba's largest attraction more attractive to folks whose appetite for summer fair fare doesn't necessarily include gut-wrenching rides, carnival games and deep-fried anything on a stick.</p>
<p>While the midway, with its scream-inducing, metallic behemoths and flashing lights, is an iconic part of any summer urban landscape, and a favourite of young fairgoers, it hasn't done much to help Winnipeg reach attendance numbers achieved by cities with similar-sized fairs.</p>
<p>Red River Ex attendance has been stagnating at around 181,000 people (mainly in the under-34 demographic) for the last decade, while Edmonton's Capital EX typically draws close to 800,000 and the Saskatoon Ex routinely brings in more than 200,000.</p>
<p>Still, we did set a new record in 2009, when an estimated 190,000 people attended the 10-day event. It was no easy feat, given the poor economy and growing fears over H1N1, says Rogerson, who attributes the increase to new exhibits and features that were added to the Ex under Phase 1 of its five-year plan. But he admits he was disappointed.</p>
<p>"I had anticipated a stronger growth than that."</p>
<p>Enter Phase 2 of the Red River Ex rejuvenation project.</p>
<p>Its centrepiece is Exhibition Place, a brand-new $3-million, 39,000-square-foot building that will house many of this year's new attractions, including Savoir-Faire: The Food and Wine Experience.</p>
<p>Guests can purchase tickets to sample made-in-Manitoba delicacies created by some of the city's best chefs, and sip wine, beer and spirits chosen to complement the cuisine. They'll also get some take-home tips about wine pairing from the "roving sommelier" and learn about gourmet cooking and flair bartending from celebrity chefs Anna Olson and Ken Kostick.</p>
<p>Exhibition Place will also host the new Creative Arts Extravaganza, a juried art show featuring the painting, drawing, sculpture and photographic talents of Manitoba's amateur artists.</p>
<p>There will also be yoga and tai chi demonstrations and an exhibit called Ex in Motion to promote physical fitness -- the first 100 visitors will receive a free pedometer -- and a concession booth selling food for the health-conscious.</p>
<p>"We're trying to show the Ex in a different light and perhaps encourage a little older audience," Rogerson says.</p>
<p>"We're already getting a broad cross-section of people, but for families in particular, we're trying to create lots of fun things they can do that are free."</p>
<p>General admission to the Ex has increased $2 to $10 this year, but Rogerson points to a number of special promotions that will ensure the fair remains inclusive. A free pancake breakfast will be held on June 20 from 11 a.m. to noon, with free gate admission until 11:30 (a non-perishable food item is encouraged). Admission is free of charge from noon to 3 p.m. on June 21, Aboriginal Day. From June 21 to 24, fairgoers pay only $5 if they enter the Ex before 5 p.m.</p>
<p>A definite highlight of the 2010 Red River Exhibition is the opportunity to visit Centreplace Manitoba, the award-winning pavilion that put our province in the spotlight during the winter Olympics in Vancouver. Inside the 2,560-square-foot, sustainable-living building, visitors will watch a panoramic video presentation and virtual tour of Manitoba and get a preview of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, a partner in the pavilion.</p>
<p>Of course, no summer fair is complete without midway rides that threaten to make you lose your grease-and-sugar filled lunch, and Rogerson promises the Ex will keep things new and exciting on that front. In fact, about to make its stomach-churning Canadian debut is The Skater, which gives the rider "the sensation of riding a skateboard through a half pipe" -- 11 metres in the air.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Slice of hockey heaven ... in Iowa; Jessica Barnett: Relishes North Shore homecoming, but field of dreams lies elsewhere</b>
</div><div>Howard Tsumura  </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>725 words</div><div>16 June 2010</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A41</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Province  </div>
</p>
<p>here's a line in the movie Field Of Dreams when John Kinsella asks his son Ray: "Is this heaven?"</p>
<p>"It's Iowa," Ray replies.</p>
<p>That's a little how North Vancouver's Jessica Barnett is beginning to feel about her own home away from home at the University of Iowa.</p>
<p>"You start to love a place once you get used to everything," Barnett, a member of The Province's 2009 Head of the Class, said earlier this month of the Iowa City campus where she spent her first year as a freshman on the Hawkeyes' field hockey team.</p>
<p>"I really like it down there." And it's obvious that the feeling from Iowa head coach Tracey Griesbaum for the former Handsworth Secondary multi-sport star is mutual.</p>
<p>Barnett, who impressed the coaching staff early with her skill and work ethic, not only wound up starting every game for the Big 10 Conference team last season as a rookie, she never left the field.</p>
<p>"I think I really wanted to be a starter at Iowa," said Barnett, whose passion is field hockey, but who also helped lead Handsworth to provincial Triple-A titles in soccer and basketball during her senior season.</p>
<p>"That was the goal, but this past season definitely exceeded my expectations. I never thought that as a freshman I would be starting every game and playing every single minute. It was like being thrown into the fire, but it was an awesome feeling."</p>
<p>So much so that Barnett, while happy to be back with family and friends on the North Shore since May, has circled the early July date when she is set to return to Iowa City, this time a month ahead of last season. The reason: She and her teammates just can't stand to be apart.</p>
<p>"There are going to be about 10 or 11 of us headed down together," said Barnett of an Iowa team that wants to rebound this coming season after a 2009 campaign in which its string of three straight Big 10 Tournament titles was snapped with a second-round loss to Michigan State.</p>
<p>"Actually, Iowa doesn't have high school field hockey, so all of the players are from out of state and most of the recruits come from the East Coast. So now, I've got a lot of friends from places like Pennsylvania, Delaware and North Carolina. I want to go and visit them, and they all want to come to Vancouver to visit because we all watched the Olympics together in February."</p>
<p>And so here's to another smooth-and-successful transition from high school to university life? Ah, Barnett won't lie. There were tough moments, too.</p>
<p>"The biggest challenge at first is being so far away from home and learning to deal with your own problems by yourself," said Barnett. "One morning, my roommate was looking at me lying in my laundry. I was just balling 'I am so sick.'"</p>
<p>"I had an exam that day, and that weekend we had to play at Northwestern," Barnett said of the trip to the Chicago area where the Hawkeyes eventually won 1-0 in overtime.</p>
<p>"I went in for tests before the game, then when we got back the coaches told me that I had swine flu. So I played an entire game and an overtime with swine flu."</p>
<p>And there's more.</p>
<p>"There was a time during the preseason when I was staying at one of the sophomore's houses," Barnett said, "and there it was in the middle of the night, a bat flying around in my room. It was three in the morning and I phoned my parents crying, 'There's a bat in my room, I don't know what to do.' So yeah, you know, all those little things."</p>
<p>It may not have been heaven every minute, but it was Iowa and Jessica Barnett can't wait to go back.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A tool for redesigning LIFE itself; The risks of synthetic biology are outweighed by the hope it may help us avert environmental catastrophe</b>
</div><div>PETER SINGER   </div>
<div>938 words</div><div>15 June 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Professor of bioethics at Princeton University; laureate professor at the University of Melbourne</p>
<p>In the 16th century, the alchemist Paracelsus offered a recipe for creating a living being that began with putting sperm into putrefying “venter equinus.” This is usually translated as “horse manure,” but the Latin “venter” means abdomen or uterus.</p>
<p>So occultists now will no doubt have a fine time with the fact that Craig Venter was the driving force behind the team of scientists that last month announced they had created a synthetic form of life: a bacterium with a genome designed and created from chemicals in a laboratory.</p>
<p>The new bacterium, nicknamed “Synthia,” replicates and produces proteins. By any reasonable definition, it is alive. Although it is very similar to a natural bacterium from which it was largely copied, the creators put distinctive strings of DNA into its genome to prove that it is not a natural object. These strings spell out, in code, a website address, the names of the researchers, and apt quotations, such as Richard Feynman's “What I cannot build, I cannot understand.”</p>
<p>For some years now, synthetic biology has been looming as the next big issue in bioethics. The scientists at the J. Craig Venter Institute expected to be told that they were “playing God,” and they were not disappointed. Yes, if one believes that life was created by God, then this comes as close to “playing God” as humans have come, so far.</p>
<p>Well-known University of Pennsylvania bioethicist Art Caplan says that the achievement ranks as a discovery of historic significance, because it “would seem to extinguish the argument that life requires a special force or power to exist.” Asked about the significance of what the team had done, Mr. Venter described it as bringing about “a giant philosophical change in how we view life.”</p>
<p>Others have pointed out that, although the team produced a synthetic genome, they put it into a cell from another bacterium, replacing that cell's DNA. We have yet to build a living organism entirely from bottles of chemicals, so anyone who believes in a “life force” that only a divine being could imbue into inert matter will no doubt continue to believe in it.</p>
<p>At a more practical level, Mr. Venter said, the team's work has produced “a very powerful set of tools” for redesigning life. He has been criticized for the fact that the research was funded by <span class="companylink">Synthetic Genomics</span>, a company that he co-founded, which will hold the intellectual property rights resulting from the research – and has already filed for 13 patents related to it. But the work has taken 20 scientists a decade to complete, at an estimated cost of $40-million, and commercial investors are an obvious source for such funds.</p>
<p>Others object that living things should not be patented. That battle was lost in 1980, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided that a genetically modified micro-organism designed to clean up oil spills could be patented. (Obviously, given the damage caused by the BP spill in the Gulf of Mexico, there is still some work to be done on that particular organism.)</p>
<p>Patenting life was taken a step further in 1984, when Harvard University successfully applied for a patent on its “oncomouse,” a laboratory mouse specifically designed to get cancer easily, so that it would be more useful as a research tool. There are good grounds for objecting to turning a sentient being into a patented laboratory tool, but it is not so easy to see why patent law should not cover newly designed bacteria or algae, which can feel nothing and may be as useful as any other invention.</p>
<p>Indeed, Synthia's very existence challenges the distinction between living and artificial that underlies much of the opposition to “patenting life” – though pointing this out is not to approve the granting of sweeping patents that prevent other scientists from making their own discoveries in this important new field.</p>
<p>As for the likely usefulness of synthetic bacteria, the fact that Synthia's birth had to compete for headlines with news of the world's worst-ever oil spill made the point more effectively than any public-relations effort could have done. One day, we may be able to design bacteria that can quickly, safely and effectively clean up oil spills. And, according to Mr. Venter, if his team's new technology had been available last year, it would have been possible to produce a vaccine to protect ourselves against H1N1 influenza in 24 hours, rather than several weeks.</p>
<p>The most exciting prospect held out by Mr. Venter, however, is a form of algae that can absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and use it to create diesel fuel or gasoline. <span class="companylink">Synthetic Genomics</span> has a $600-million agreement with <span class="companylink">ExxonMobil</span> to obtain fuel from algae.</p>
<p>Obviously, the release of any synthetic organism must be carefully regulated, just like the release of any genetically modified organism. But any risk must be weighed against other grave threats that we face. For example, international climate-change negotiations appear to have reached an impasse, and public skepticism about global warming is rising, even as the scientific evidence continues to show that it is real and will endanger the lives of billions of people.</p>
<p>In such circumstances, the admittedly very real risks of synthetic biology seem decisively outweighed by the hope that it may enable us to avert a looming environmental catastrophe.</p>

<p>OFFICE EPIDEMIC / SOCCER SICKNESS</p>
<p>Wonder why all your employees have come down with food poisoning? More likely, they're infected with World Cup fever. Twelve per cent of British men say they'd use food poisoning as an excuse to stay home and watch soccer, HR Magazine reports. Seven per cent would cite a doctor, dentist, or physiotherapy appointment. But since hangover symptoms can resemble the effects of a stomach bug, beer-swilling World Cup fans may be forgiven for confusing the two. The average British person goes to work hung over three times a month, says the magazine, which warns that rate is likely to soar during the soccer event. Forget H1N1. World Cup fever may turn out to be the real productivity killer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Federal government to offer cash incentives</b>
</div><div>Kathryn May   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>472 words</div><div>15 June 2010</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Treasury Board President Stockwell Day is offering public servants cash awards if they can find ways to save money while improving service to Canadians.</p>
<p>On Monday, Day announced the new Employee Innovation Program at the awards ceremony that kicked off National Public Service Week to recognize the country's more than 277,000 public servants. But more importantly, it's an incentive scheme to tackle the Conservatives' mounting deficit and the $1.7 billion Day is looking for in savings this year.</p>
<p>The individual or team of workers who come up with the best ideas are in line for a 10 per cent cut of the first year's savings up to a maximum of $10,000. "I hear about ideas out there so this gives them the chance to prove it," Day told reporters after the ceremony. "This is a lot more than a suggestion box."</p>
<p>The money-savings ideas are supposed to creative, yet practical. The aim is to find ways to deliver programs and services in a better way while saving money.</p>
<p>The ideas being pitched will have to be submitted with a plan of action that the proponents will get a chance to implement. An audit will be conducted six months after the plan is unrolled and if actual savings are achieved, the bureaucrats cash in with a capped share of the savings.</p>
<p>"This is geared to employees who identify ways to deliver a service that saves money and once that program has been audited that they did save that money, they get to keep 10 per cent, up to $10,000, and the taxpayer gets 90 per cent," said Day.</p>
<p>The programs is open to all bureaucrats but Day said it is aimed at frontline workers. Federal executives already get performance pay and bonuses to recognize their work, but there are no incentive programs for rank and file workers.</p>
<p>But Day assured the crowd that savings aren't coming from laying off workers. "The idea cannot include letting their workmates go," Day said. That's not part of the innovation we are looking for."</p>
<p>For now, the award scheme is being tried as a two-year pilot in eight departments: Parks Canada, Veterans Affairs Canada, Health Canada, Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency, Environment Canada, Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada and Treasury Board.</p>
<p>The government has a slew of awards for public servants, including the `awards of excellence' given Monday to more than 200 public servants during the annual awards ceremony in Gatineau, Que.</p>
<p>Top honours went to bureaucrats for outstanding individual achievements as well as the teams who worked on pressing issues, such as the relief effort in Haiti; managing the H1N1 pandemic and supporting the Afghanistan mission.</p>

</p>
<p>Fewer than one in five Vancouver Island doctors washes hands before seeing patients, the regional health authority's head of patient safety has found.</p>
<p>According to hand hygiene compliance audits conducted in January and February, just 18 per cent of doctors washed their hands when visiting a patient, compared to the total score of 30 per cent for all types of health care workers combined.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority's audit improved over last year's scores of 15 per cent, but, considering the intensive handwashing campaign launched in the face of H1N1 influenza and the increasing number of outbreaks at various facilities, staff members need to do better, says Dr. Martin Wale, executive medical director of quality and patient safety.</p>
<p>Scores at Nanaimo Regional General Hospital improved from last year as well, but over all, the nurses, physicians, specialists and housekeepers received a failing 41 per cent score during the one-day snapshot of each of the units.</p>
<p>Some areas of the hospital set off alarm bells for Wale, particularly in medical imaging, which received 14-per-cent compliance and is used by patients from all over the hospital.</p>
<p>Other low scores include nine-percent compliance in the surgical-recovery room and seven per cent in the perinatal unit.</p>
<p>The finding has inspired a new policy to change people's hand hygiene practice at NRGH.</p>
<p>The 11-month outbreak of C. difficile that began at NRGH in July 2008 alerted health officials of the need to improve housekeeping and hand hygiene, among other issues.</p>
<p>Since then, VIHA has introduced hand sanitizers throughout care facilities and launched hand hygiene education campaigns, but still "hand hygiene compliance results are unacceptable," Wale wrote in a memorandum to staff Thursday.</p>
<p>Clostridium difficile infection rates have decreased at NRGH in recent weeks, but Wale said he is reluctant to call off the continuing outbreak that began March 31, particularly considering the latest hand hygiene audits.</p>
<p>He said he wants to see 95 per cent compliance.</p>
<p>One suggestion is that hospital staff could improve their results dramatically simply by removing jewelry.</p>
<p>Hospital staff are under tremendous pressure, Wale explained.</p>
<p>NRGH is consistently operating above capacity and the aging building lacks handwashing units, according to a scathing report from a B.C. Centre of Disease Control inspection conducted during the 2008-09 outbreak that infected nearly 100 people and killed five.</p>
<p>"None of [the unit scores] are anywhere near okay," Wale said. "Yes, the staff are busy and yes, the building is old, but we need to provide the best care we can with the facilities we've got."</p>
<p>Physicians need to improve their scores to set an example, Wale added.</p>

</p>
<p>I first learned about Twitter two years ago this month at a conference on the future of journalism.</p>
<p>The online social networking tool was then the new thing in communications technology and few of the veteran journalists in the room had yet heard of http://twitter.com/TwitterEND[http://twitter.com/TwitterEND], let alone tried to tweet.</p>
<p>Since then, I have become a Twitterer (albeit a sporadic one) and watched closely as Twitter took centre stage in the digital media zeitgeist. By last June, al"Twitter revolution" was declared when protestors in Iran turned to Twitter to connect to the world at large and communicate their opposition to the re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p>
<p>Now, with more than 105 million users worldwide and 2 million new users signing on every week, Twitter is fast becoming an important tool within mainstream media for breaking news, reporting in real-time, finding story ideas, connecting with sources, engaging with audiences and disseminating our work to wider audiences.</p>
<p>A study released last week concluded that journalists who cover Canadian politics are using Twitter far more extensively and to better advantage than politicians. The study, by Tamara Small, an assistant professor at Mount Allison University, analyzed political messaging on Twitter and also found that Twitter is spreading the influence of political reporting and analysis in traditional media.</p>
<p>It would be an overstatement to suggest that all journalists have taken to Twitter. The Star'swebsite links to only about 30 journalists who routinely tweet for this news organization (though other Star staff make personal use of Twitter). Within any gathering of journalists, it's not unusual to hear news veterans state that they "don't Twitter" and to condescendingly question what can be communicated in a 140-character tweet.</p>
<p>Given that Twitter is hardly novel these days, that view is beginning to sound dated. Isn't it time we put this debate to rest and recognize that Twitter and other tools of new media can actually enhance our journalism?</p>
<p>Certainly the Star's Joanna Smith proved that in her reporting from earthquake-ravaged Haiti earlier this year. With little access to telephone lines and computers, Twitter became Smith's lifeline, allowing her to file instant, constant updates through her mobile phone. Smith's tweets brought dramatic real-time reporting and interactivity to - and from - followers around the world.</p>
<p>Smith's tweeting from the earthquake zone has been widely lauded. Two weeks ago, she was invited to speak about journalism and Twitter at Mesh, Canada's preeminent web conference.</p>
<p>Time magazine followed Smith's tweets from Haiti, and Twitter itself singled her out on its media blog. The blog boasted of Twitter's role in helping journalists communicate from the earthquake zone and stated: "But the tweets from one reporter, Joanna Smith from the Toronto Star, were a little different.</p>
<p>"Joanna's tweets were like tiny stories unto themselves - whole narratives in 140 characters. And her thumbnail descriptions, packed with telling details, communicated things that blaring headlines couldn't."</p>
<p>As an example, the blog cited one of many tweets Smith filed from a Haiti hospital: "Woman in A-line skirt, clean white blouse, wanders thru ward, singing, praying w book in hand: 'Chants d'esperance.'"</p>
<p>What do Smith's tweets tell us, the Twitter blog asks? - "There's power in great writing, even (or especially) at 140 characters."</p>
<p>Smith, a political reporter in the Star's Ottawa bureau, regards Twitter as "an incredibly valuable reporting tool." She has been tweeting from parliamentary committee meetings for some time and notes that many Parliament Hill reporters have now embraced Twitter. She believes Twitter has the potential to "transform" journalism by making it more collaborative and reflective of readers' concerns:</p>
<p>"Journalists have always crafted our stories in a sort of vacuum and then suddenly unveiled them to the world and moved on to the next thing. Twitter allows journalists to let readers in on the process of crafting a story, tweeting little bits of information as we go along."</p>
<p>In covering the H1N1 "pandemic" last fall, Smith used Twitter to connect with readers and sources. "I would often get questions and suggestions from readers who had an interesting perspective on the issue. A mother whose child is sick is going to have something different to say than an epidemiologist at a research hospital, and without Twitter I might not have ever known about it."</p>
<p>Smith now connects directly - and transparently - with sources on Twitter: "Just this morning I received direct feedback from a cabinet minister I had mentioned in a tweet and was able to respond to it just as directly," she told me.</p>
<p>Clearly, Twitter offers rich possibilities for enhancing journalism. But, like other digital tools that are transforming traditional journalism, Twitter brings with it new ethical issues for journalists. I'll tell you more about that next week.</p>

<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>. is diversifying by opening a Mexico-based tour operator, targeting Mexican leisure travellers who take vacations within their own country and in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>For Transat, whose stock price has fallen more than 50 per cent since the start of the year, the strategic move is designed to give it a lift in Mexico during the summer season, when Canadians turn their sights to Europe and away from sunny climes south.</p>
<p>Eleva Travel, based in Monterrey, Mexico, will sell its products starting in July, primarily through travel agents, Transat chief executive officer Jean-Marc Eustache said Thursday during the firm's second-quarter conference call with analysts.</p>
<p>Montreal-based Transat has been stung by fierce competition from rivals such as <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. and Air Canada, resulting in lower prices for vacations and fewer packages sold. Canada's largest tour operator still managed to post a $6.2-million profit for the three months ended April 30, albeit down from a $42.2-million profit in the same period last year.</p>
<p>The latest results translated into an adjusted share loss of 7 cents, which was better than analysts' loss estimates of 9 cents for a quarter that traditionally should be healthy. Quarterly revenue slipped 6 per cent to $1.06-billion. Flight disruptions due to volcanic ash from Iceland in April prompted Transat to absorb $4-million in costs arising from cancellations and delays.</p>
<p>“Transat has faced heavy discounts on North American package prices as WestJet targets expansion through its vacations division,” <span class="companylink">RBC Dominion Securities Inc</span>. analyst Tanya Messinger said in a research note.</p>
<p>But Ms. Messinger said the Eleva initiative could help Transat fill three Mexican hotels, co-owned through its Ocean Hotels joint venture, during the seasonally weaker summer period in the country. Eleva will focus on the Mexican markets of Cancun, Puerto Vallarta, Acapulco, Los Cabos and Ixtapa. Las Vegas will also be marketed as a key tourist destination for Mexicans.</p>
<p>The global tourism industry is still recovering from the recession and the H1N1 influenza outbreak. Last year, the Canadian government's requirement that Mexicans obtain visas to visit Canada, effective last July, hurt inbound visits from Mexico. For now, Canada won't be on Eleva's radar.</p>
<p>“We believe as Eleva builds its operations, it will enable Transat to somewhat offset competitive pressure on Canada-Mexico packages by allowing Transat to better manage its hotel commitments in Mexico, as Mexicans typically focus on domestic destinations and may also potentially lead to better deals with hoteliers if volumes increase,” <span class="companylink">National Bank Financial Inc</span>. analyst David Newman said in a research note.</p>
<p>Transat's capacity to Europe this summer is up 15 per cent from a year earlier, but Versant Partners Inc. analyst Cameron Doerksen said next winter's Mexican and Caribbean markets look challenging.</p>
<p>This past winter's travel industry overcapacity and associated price discounting hurt Transat. Mr. Doerksen said WestJet, Air Canada, Sunwing Travel Group and Thomas Cook Canada Ltd.'s Sunquest will be battling it out for customers next winter, with the potential for a new entrant, Direct Save Holidays, under the leadership of travel industry veteran Robbie Goldberg.</p>
<p>Mr. Doerksen reduced his one-year target price on Transat to $12.75 from $15.</p>

<p>apicard@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Friday will mark the one-year anniversary of influenza A/H1N1 being declared a pandemic. The pesky little virus, despite some early hype, didn't turn out to be much of a killer, but it continues to make headlines.</p>
<p>Let's take a look behind one of those headlines, as it appeared in The Globe and Mail: The Flu Reality: Ottawa's Mass Immunization Program Failed was a story about the dramatically different vaccination rates during the mass immunization campaign.</p>
<p>There is no doubt that vaccination rates were abysmal, particularly given the investment in a “universal” campaign. Public-health officials said repeatedly that they were hoping to get at least 70 per cent of citizens immunized, a level at which there would be herd immunity so even the unvaccinated would be largely protected.</p>
<p>More than $2-billion was spent buying vaccine, setting up clinics and on a massive advertising campaign, and it was supplemented by blanket media coverage.</p>
<p>Yet, in three provinces – Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba – barely one-third of citizens received the vaccine.</p>
<p>In Canada's biggest city, Toronto, only one in four people got a pandemic flu shot.</p>
<p>Only one province, Newfoundland, reached the 70-per-cent target.</p>
<p>But does that mean the vaccination campaign was a failure?</p>
<p>What matters ultimately is the health of the public and the bottom line was that 2009-10 will be remembered as one of the mildest, least deadly flu seasons on record.</p>
<p>Sure, Mother Nature played a role: The feared pandemic strain H1N1 turned out to be pretty lame, though it did kill a troubling number of young healthy people. And let's not forget that, along with the flu, rates of other viral diseases plummeted, a result of heightened awareness and the new-found fondness for hand washing.</p>
<p>Canada's pandemic preparedness plan also got its first real-life test and there should be some valuable lessons learned.</p>
<p>Two lessons stand out above all others: 1) good communication is paramount and 2) mass campaigns don't really work in the 21st century.</p>
<p>Put another way, the notion that we could vaccinate 70 per cent or more of the population in a short time period is unrealistic.</p>
<p>And the idea that we could convince them to do so by essentially yelling at them through a bullhorn is fantastical.</p>
<p>The hallmark of modern society is individualism, with communities fragmented into subpopulations.</p>
<p>We also live in skeptical times, cynical times even. Anything that the government says is good or necessary will trigger a backlash.</p>
<p>Finally, in our fast-paced world, we live in the present. Nothing is a threat unless it is in our face – and then we expect instant help.</p>
<p>We saw all these factors come into play with H1N1. Conspiracy theories abounded. Many people decided they would only get the vaccine if there was an imminent threat to their own health. In fact, vaccination rates were highest in small communities, where people had personal knowledge of those sick with H1N1.</p>
<p>Despite these modern realities – all of them well known – public-health and government officials opted for a big, centralized, vaccine campaign with dour messaging from wooden public officials.</p>
<p>A distinctly 20th-century approach that was costly and not particularly effective.</p>
<p>We have to be careful here not to judge the performance of public health too harshly, or in hindsight. There was an honest scientific belief that a pandemic strain of influenza would necessarily be more virulent and deadly. The reality too is it takes months to produce vaccines, essentially forcing governments to take all-or-nothing gambles.</p>
<p>Still, the implementation of the vaccine campaign could have been much better – particularly on the communications side.</p>
<p>So what big lessons need to be retained and acted upon in updating pandemic planning and public-health messaging more generally?</p>
<p>First and foremost, public-health officials have to stop behaving like vaccination is an opiate for the masses.</p>
<p>Preachy sloganeering is not enough. You need to engage the public, sell the benefits, talk openly about the risks, and roll up your sleeves and take on the critics. There is much skepticism and it has only grown because of H1N1.</p>
<p>In a fragmented media market, six-page newspaper ads don't cut it. Public-health messaging has to be more pointed and targeted at specific communities.</p>
<p>In the era of the 24-hour news cycle, the traditional once-a-day press conference featuring talking heads with a bunch of fancy titles has to be revamped and supplemented with Twitter posts, <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos and the like.</p>
<p>The public needs to be engaged in conversations and debate about issues of public health, they don't need to be lectured to.</p>
<p>While there needs to be a variety of methods, the message needs to be clear. During H1N1, there was much “conflusion,” much of it stemming from a desire to act on a large scale and reluctance on the part of public officials to utter the words: “We don't know.”</p>
<p>Knowledge evolves, sometimes day-to-day. The public understands this, so give them some credit.</p>
<p>In times of (potential) crisis such as a feared pandemic, existing networks have to be put to good use. One of the big mistakes of the H1N1 vaccination campaign was not providing vaccine to individual physicians and clinics. The large clinics, which were costly and took a lot of time to set up, should have supplemented not supplanted normal operations.</p>
<p>Finally, public health has to be a lot more pro-active, and less reactive.</p>
<p>It is telling that the story comparing vaccination rates between provinces was based on the research of a reporter. The Public Health Agency of Canada refused to release the information, contenting itself with blandishments such as: “More than half the population was vaccinated.”</p>
<p>Public health needs to be more open about its successes and its failures. It can be bruising, but that's how you earn the public trust.</p>

<p>- The federal government is taking heat for a decision to spend $2 million to build an indoor lake in downtown Toronto to impress international journalists covering the G8 and G20 summits. Liberal MPs have referred to the lake as Gilligan's Island. Which leads to an obvious question: Mr. Howell or the Skipper?</p>
<p>- From a reader: "So, $1 billion for security at the upcoming G20 conference! Sort of makes you long for the good old days of the 1997 APEC meeting when Canada first set the bar for world-class security with just a few cans of pepper spray.''</p>

<p>- Apple CEO Steve Jobs couldn't get a Wi-Fi connection during the unveiling of the iPhone 4 the other day. Now he knows how the rest of us feel.</p>
<p>- Reports indicate that nearly half of Saskatoon's residents received the H1N1 vaccination during the flu outbreak late last year, including about 70 per cent of children under age 10. While the threatened pandemic never materialized, a reader hopes the vaccine could yet be effective in warding off the next threatened pandemic that will sweep the city -- Justin Bieber fever.</p>
<p>- Why would a radio talking head say, "as we told you two weeks ago," when the story to which he was referring was a rip-and-read from the newspaper?</p>
<p>- It took a jury pool of 1,200 to find the 12 that are hearing the case of a Regina doctor charged with sexual assault. Was this a jury selection or an American Idol audition?</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic didn't so much sweep through Canada's 30-million-plus population as putter along, leaving Canadians relatively unscathed but feeling confused and much poorer. When the H1N1 pandemic loomed at its most threatening, Canada spent $2 billion trying to inoculate every man, woman, and child in the country.</p>
<p>But as a new report points out, it failed quite miserably to do that in many provinces. The highest provincial inoculation rate was in Newfoundland, at 70 per cent. Alberta's rate was the lowest at 35 per cent. In Hamilton, Ont., barely 25 per cent of people were inoculated.</p>
<p>For all the panic and the government's desperate scrambling to get its hands on 50 million doses of vaccine, in Canada H1N1 left fewer dead and ill than a run-of-the-mill influenza in any given year. In the year between March 2009, when the outbreak started, and March this year, 428 deaths and more than 8,600 hospitalizations were attributed to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Does this mean our response to the pandemic was a failure? That's not a useful way to look at it. We were lucky. H1N1 was not as deadly as international medical experts had originally feared it would be.</p>
<p>The best thing would be to consider our response the equivalent of a fire drill. We had a chance to see how well we could roll out a countrywide inoculation program under pressure.</p>
<p>Some things did go wrong: Alberta opened its vaccination clinics to all, ignoring the agreed-on priority list in which small children and pregnant women would be inoculated first. Clinics were promptly over-run and ran out of vaccine. Ontario also used a first-come, first-inoculated policy, resulting in people waiting for hours in lineups, not an ideal arrangement in the midst of a supposed pandemic.</p>
<p>The media, it has to be admitted, sometimes stoked a sense of panic. It was not helpful to demand elected officials resign if a single person died.</p>
<p>Other people took too sanguine an approach, convinced that health officials were over-reacting. The problem with that attitude is there's no way of knowing how deadly a pandemic will turn out to be.</p>
<p>There could well be a real threat one day. Without solving the problems that arose in how Canada handled the H1N1 pandemic, we could find ourselves in a deadly dilemma, making exactly the same mistakes as we did this time around, only with far worse results.</p>
<p>Let's learn from the past.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- With the H1N1 flu all but over in many parts of the world and questions about the World Health Organization's handling of the pandemic beginning to mount, the head of the global health body has come out swinging at her critics.</p>
<p>Director-General Margaret Chan rejected claims that the WHO provoked unnecessary fear, and then, directing her comments to an article published in a prominent British medical journal, she dismissed suggestions that her decisions on the pandemic were influenced by ties to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>“At no time, not for one second, did commercial interests enter my decision-making,” Dr. Chan said in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her comments are in response to last week's report in the BMJ that said three scientists at the WHO received payments from Roche and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, manufacturers of antiviral drugs, and also helped prepare pandemic guidelines in 2004 that included the use of antivirals. The WHO did not publicly disclose their conflicts of interests, the journal stated. Further, the journal asked why the names of those who sit on the emergency committee and advise Dr. Chan are shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>In an accompanying editorial, BMJ editor Fiona Godlee said the WHO's credibility had been damaged. “Recovery will be fastest if it publishes its own report without delay or defensive comment; makes public the membership and conflicts of interest of its emergency committee; and develops, commits to, and monitors stricter rules of engagement with industry that keep commercial influence away from its decision making,” Dr. Godlee wrote.</p>
<p>The WHO's handling of the outbreak is being reviewed by an independent committee, which will likely report back by next year. In the meantime, Dr. Chan said the BMJ article leaves an unfair impression that the WHO's decision to declare a pandemic was partially motivated by a desire to fatten the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry, which stood to profit from the sale of the vaccine and anti-viral medications.</p>

<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>With the H1N1 flu all but over in many parts of the world and questions about the World Health Organization’s handling of the pandemic beginning to mount, the head of the global health body has come out swinging at her critics.</p>
<p>Director-General Margaret Chan rejected claims that the WHO provoked unnecessary fear, and then, directing her comments to an article published in a prominent British medical journal, she dismissed suggestions that her decisions on the pandemic were influenced by ties to the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
<p>“At no time, not for one second, did commercial interests enter my decision-making,” Dr. Chan said in a statement Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her comments are in response to last week’s report in the BMJ that said three scientists at the WHO received payments from Roche and GlaxoSmithKline, manufacturers of antiviral drugs, and also helped prepare pandemic guidelines in 2004 that included the use of antivirals. The WHO did not publicly disclose their conflicts of interests, the journal stated. Further, the journal asked why the names of those who sit on the emergency committee and advise Dr. Chan are shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>In an accompanying editorial, BMJ editor Fiona Godlee said the WHO’s credibility had been damaged. “Recovery will be fastest if it publishes its own report without delay or defensive comment; makes public the membership and conflicts of interest of its emergency committee; and develops, commits to, and monitors stricter rules of engagement with industry that keep commercial influence away from its decision making,” Dr. Godlee wrote.</p>
<p>The WHO’s handling of the outbreak is being reviewed by an independent committee, which will likely report back by next year. In the meantime, Dr. Chan said the BMJ article leaves an unfair impression that the WHO’s decision to declare a pandemic was partially motivated by a desire to fatten the pockets of the pharmaceutical industry, which stood to profit from the sale of the vaccine and anti-viral medications.</p>
<p>“The bottom line, however, is that decisions to raise the level of pandemic alert were based on clearly defined virological and epidemiological criteria. It is hard to bend these criteria, no matter what the motive,” she said.</p>
<p>The review committee, she said, will examine the events leading up to the pandemic and the WHO will be open to its recommendations and criticisms. “Should this committee decide that the current definition of a pandemic and the phases leading up to its declaration need to be tightened or otherwise revised, this will be another recommendation that we will welcome, and act on,” Dr. Chan said.</p>
<p>She added that the names of members on the emergency committee will be made public once their work is completed, and that the reason decision not to identify them release it beforehand is to protect them from commercial or other influences.</p>

</p>
<p>"People were nervous ... typically we would equip one person with a gown, mask and goggles so he or she could go in close to assess a patient ... but we made it up as we went along. What standards should we have been following?"</p>
<p>For those at the front line of Canada's first global flu pandemic in more than 40 years, H1N1 exposed serious gaps in the nation's pandemic planning, according to a white paper produced by CSA Standards, the Canadian Standards Association.</p>
<p>According to the paper -the result of a roundtable discussion held in December with key leaders representing doctors, nurses, hospitals and first-responders -a patchwork of pandemic plans at different government levels caused "tremendous confusion" on the front lines. Confusion reigned over who should be given protective equipment, what kind and under what circumstances; how fast the virus was spreading, and where it was spreading most quickly; who was at greatest risk for infection and death; whether there were sufficient antiviral medications available; and whether the new vaccine was safe, especially for children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>The outbreak exposed unreasonable guidelines that simply couldn't be followed in real-world settings, participants said. For example, Canada's pandemic plan recommends nurses and doctors stand "six feet away from a potentially infectious person" and that a "clean room" be used to keep flu patients away from other patients -guidelines that "could simply not be followed in many hospitals and in most primary care settings," the paper says.</p>
<p>"The 2009 influenza pandemic was less lethal than it might have been and while there clearly were lives lost, a fact the roundtable participants do not wish in any way to minimize, Canadians were fortunate in that it could have been much, much worse."</p>
<p>Participants told of hospitals running out of protective masks early in the pandemic. Others said governments "over promised" the vaccine in early days and that better vaccine distribution systems must be designed for future outbreaks to avoid the hours-long lineups that occurred in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>The white paper will be presented today at the World Conference on Disaster Management in Toronto.</p>
<p>One issue that flared up was the use of masks, "and this whole debate about surgical masks versus N95s, and waiting for the science to somehow prove that a surgical mask is going to be safe," said Dr. Allan Holmes, an emergency physician and pandemic expert who moderated the roundtable discussion.</p>
<p>N95 masks are designed to prevent airborne transmission of disease. As opposed to surgical masks that are cheap and straightforward to use, the N95 masks are custom-fitted and require training to wear properly.</p>
<p>"We're in conflict with the science and the experts saying, oh no, surgical masks are just fine but you're dealing with the reality of people who actually have to stand in front of infected patients," Holmes said.</p>
<p>He said a single, pan-Canadian approach to pandemic planning is needed, as well as some kind of severity index to put future outbreaks into context.</p>

<p>The vaccine queues and emergency room pandemonium are dim memories for most people, but last year's H1N1 pandemic is still on the minds of health officials across the country and around the world.</p>
<p>Now that the pandemic is over in Canada (though it lingers in some parts of the world), health and government officials have been examining what went wrong and what went right, and trying to figure out how things could be done differently next time -- for it is likely there will be a next time.</p>
<p>While H1N1 met the technical definition of a worldwide pandemic, it wasn't nearly as dangerous a plague as people feared. The death toll was lower than predicted (some 426 deaths in Canada). Yet health officials were scared because H1N1 presented itself differently than strains of flu that normally circulate during the winter. It seemed to hit young people the hardest, whereas normal flus typically hit the elderly. Microbiologists couldn't help but think of the devastating 1918 influenza that turned the lungs of healthy young people to mush.</p>
<p>In the end, H1N1 was nothing like the 1918 outbreak, so the question being asked today is if governments and the World Health Organization overreacted, spending money that could have been spent elsewhere. The allegation health officials cried wolf is worrisome, because it means many people might ignore warnings about the next pandemic and decline to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>It may even be the H1N1 vaccination campaign was not as effective as it should have been. In Hamilton, only between 19 and 25 per cent of the population was immunized. The province of Alberta was only able to achieve a vaccination rate of 35 per cent. Manitoba, the scene of some of the worst effects of the flu, especially on northern reserves, had a similarly unimpressive vaccination rate.</p>
<p>Ottawa did well with a vaccination rate of about 53 per cent -- one of the highest in the province. Despite lineups early on, the Ottawa effort was efficient and effective, which is likely one reason so many people got the shot. Officials from cities such as Ottawa might have something to teach other communities about running a vaccine campaign.</p>
<p>But municipalities can't do it alone. Federal health officials must also look seriously at the concerns of Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, who has noted that poor communications about vaccine supply obstructed the campaign.</p>
<p>Rather than becoming complacent on the grounds that H1N1 wasn't so bad after all -- or, worse, embracing conspiracy theories that Big Pharma manipulated scientists into expressing alarm, in order to sell more vaccines -- Canadians should simply acknowledge that epidemiology is an inexact science and be thankful that we got off lucky this time.</p>
<p>The proper response is to consider H1N1 a trial run -- and to hope that, next time around, better communications and planning will produce higher vaccination rates.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Learn from H1N1 crisis</b>
</div><div>261 words</div><div>5 June 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>

<p>This editorial ran in Friday's Waterloo Region Record:</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu pandemic has moved - or, rather, seems to have moved - into the medical history books.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this virus never turned out to be quite as dangerous to the general population as initially feared. The virus, however, was a contributing factor to the deaths of several local residents who had medical conditions that made them more susceptible to it.</p>
<p>Medical officials and health ministries in this country may now look back and assess what they did during the crisis. The point of looking back is not to criticize those who made decisions in good faith but to learn how better to manage similar viral outbreaks in future. Sadly, in this age when travelling around the world is relatively easy there is little doubt that more viruses will spread around the globe.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief officer of health, has concluded that about 38 per cent of Ontarians received the H1N1 vaccine. This is considerably below the province's target. It is also one of the lowest rates for any Canadian province. Speaking last December, King said this province wanted to vaccinate about 75 per cent of Ontarians.</p>
<p>The province should try to find out why relatively few Ontarians bothered to get the shot.</p>
<p>Behind all the problems was an imbalance between supply and demand. The vaccine was in short supply when the virus was in its acute stage, but more than enough was available later when the virus appeared not to be so virulent.</p>

<p>TORONTO -- The World Health Organization is facing criticism of its handling of the H1N1 pandemic as two new reports accuse the global health body of failing to disclose possible ties with the pharmaceutical industry and of pushing countries to waste millions of dollars by overstating the threat.</p>
<p>The reports from Europe were released on Friday, at the end of a week in which the WHO said that the H1N1 pandemic is not over, although its most intense activity has passed in many parts of the world.</p>
<p>The health committee of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe accused the WHO of exaggerating the threat of H1N1, unnecessarily scaring the public and causing countries to waste millions of dollars fighting it. A report by BMJ, a prominent medical journal in Britain, said the WHO relied on advice from scientists with ties to pharmaceutical companies when it developed guidelines on the use of antiviral drugs, and it asked why the names of those who sit on the WHO's emergency committee are shrouded in secrecy.</p>
<p>A WHO spokesman said the agency's response to the virus was necessary given its potential threat, and that the organization is careful not to let the drug industry influence its decision making.</p>
<p>“I think there will always be perhaps attempts by the pharmaceutical industry. But WHO has systems in place to prevent any attempts to exert undue influence. Those are stopped,” Gregory Hartl said.</p>
<p>The BMJ article said three experts who received payments from <span class="companylink">Roche Holdings AG</span> and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span>, manufacturers of antiviral drugs, also helped in preparing pandemic guidelines in 2004, which included the use of antivirals. The WHO did not publicly disclose their conflicts of interest, the journal stated.</p>
<p>But Mr. Hartl said it's standard procedure at the WHO for everyone to declare their conflicts. He said the names of emergency committee members won't be disclosed until their work is completed because “there could be any number of different pressures which would be placed on these committee members. … It would make it far more difficult for these people to give good advice if their names were public.”</p>
<p>Donald Low, chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said it's not surprising that scientists have some association with industry at some point in their careers. But he agreed with the BMJ that the names of the committee members and their possible conflicts of interest should be made public.</p>

<p>Toronto -- How can it be said that the vaccination program failed (The Flu Reality: Ottawa's Mass Immunization Program Failed – June 3)? The reality is that many people decided, regardless of the government's efforts, not to bother with the flu shot. Why would that, in the context of an overblown description of the risks, be considered a failure? Perhaps people in Ontario, Alberta and Manitoba think for themselves more than people in other provinces, while in others, they are more likely to do what the government says. The failure here was not the low levels of vaccination, but the overreaction to a relatively harmless strain of flu in the first place.</p>

<p>Toronto -- Working as a physician in one of the largest HIV clinics in Canada, it was evident from the outset our response to the H1N1 pandemic virus would be less than adequate (Ottawa Blames Provinces For Low H1N1 Vaccine Turnout – June 4). Ottawa must take some accountability for the dismal supply of vaccine, produced here by a single manufacturer. Managing the clinical needs of more than 2,600 patients living with HIV should have identified us a “high risk” clinic yet, despite many letters and calls, we received only 200 to 400 doses at a time, often weeks apart. When we did get vaccine, a ridiculous amount of administrative paperwork was burdened upon us by provincial authorities.</p>
<p>A major challenge not often mentioned, however, is the media's role. Many of my patients were quoting TV, Internet and newspapers regarding the theoretical risks of the vaccine, resulting in apprehension to being immunized. The same weight was often given to the vaccine's theoretical risks, frequently voiced by non-experts, and the real risks of the infection. Most physicians I know supported the use of the vaccine, yet this message was overshadowed.</p>
<p>We were fortunate that the lethality of the virus was less than initially thought; one hopes we will learn from our bungled efforts before the next pandemic.</p>
