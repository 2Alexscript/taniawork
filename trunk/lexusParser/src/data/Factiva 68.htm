<p>Re: "Canadian swine flu cases confirmed; 'Mild' illness for N.S., B.C. victims," The Journal, April 27.</p>
<p>As swine flu approaches Alberta from both coasts, we're advised to take common-sense precautions, such as washing our hands frequently and avoiding crowds.</p>
<p>In the last few days, I've seen people on city sidewalks have bouts of sneezing, which they didn't attempt to smother, sending clouds of particles onto passersby. The particles were probably harmless, though unhygienic, but they're a sign of the times.</p>
<p>Before the flu arrives in Edmonton, we should remind people to cover their mouths when clearing their throats. In fact, we should bring back the slogan broadcast during the 1957 flu season -- "Coughs and sneezes spread diseases; catch them all in your handkerchievzes!" Except now, we'd have to say "tissues."</p>

<p>Travellers returning from Mexico don't need to isolate themselves from co-workers, family, or friends if they are not experiencing flu-like symptoms, says Alberta's top public health doctor.</p>
<p>"We are trying to help people understand that even if they have travelled to Mexico, and if they are feeling well, they don't really need to do anything," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"If they have symptoms, those are the people we are concerned about. Other people who haven't travelled and are developing flu-like illness, they should treat it the way they always do, because we still have a lot of other types of viruses that are circulating."</p>
<p>Those who have come in contact with swine flu carriers are being asked to "self-isolate" at home, but the public health department is not putting harsh restrictions on their movements if they are not experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We don't forbid, if they are asymptomatic, to do their regular business. Certainly, we want them to avoid parties or crowds or public settings. But if they need to do their grocery shopping, and they are asymptomatic, then it's not like a quarantine is imposed."</p>
<p>All travellers to Mexico are being asked to contact their doctors if they experience fever, cough or difficulty breathing. The incubation period for the flu can be up to seven days, but more often is three to four days.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says the best way to protect yourself from the flu is to wash your hands, cover your coughs and sneezes, stay away from crowded places if you are sick, and get an annual flu shot.</p>

<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>

</p>
<p>The first two confirmed cases of swine flu in Alberta are likely just the beginning, but it remains unclear how badly the province will be hit, health authorities say.</p>
<p>"Right now, (the evidence) doesn't tell us about how severe it's going to be, how far it's going to go and how quickly it's going to die out," said Andre Corriveau, the province's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"If it behaves like every flu virus we know, it has a seasonal pattern, so we could expect that we'll have a few weeks of cases and then it will peter out. Then it's really in the southern hemisphere where we might see what happens next."</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the illness, Premier Ed Stelmach urged Albertans not to panic.</p>
<p>"I just ask everybody, calm down," he said.</p>
<p>Stelmach said the swine flu cases may make good headlines because they play on people's emotions and fears.</p>
<p>"We're following very closely the advice of the medical officer of health, and whatever resources he needs, they will be provided."</p>
<p>The confirmed cases announced Tuesday were found in two men, one from Calgary and one from an undisclosed location in northern Alberta.</p>
<p>Both victims had a mild form of human swine flu after recently travelling to Mexico and neither was hospitalized for the illness. The man from northern Alberta has fully recovered and the Calgarian has nearly recovered.</p>
<p>"We became aware of the cases late (Monday) night and we had to take some time to make sure the patients were notified," Corriveau said.</p>
<p>There are 13 confirmed Canadian cases in four different provinces -- two in Alberta, four in Ontario, four in Nova Scotia and three in British Columbia. All have links with travel to Mexico, where the illness is suspected of killing more than 150 people and sickening more than 1,600.</p>
<p>Corriveau said the Alberta cases were expected since many people travel this time of year to Mexico. The victims are not elderly, though Corriveau would not provide any other information on their ages. Nor would he say where they spent time in Mexico, citing privacy concerns.</p>
<p>The Alberta cases were confirmed by provincial laboratories in Calgary and Edmonton, which were equipped this week to do the appropriate testing.</p>
<p>Corriveau refused to say how the men were identified as candidates for testing, or whether they sought testing themselves.</p>
<p>He also declined to detail the timeline of the cases, including when the men became sick and whether they went to work or any public venues after returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>He said the victims were asked to stay home. As their symptoms disappear, they are essentially free to resume their routines.</p>
<p>"They were seen fairly soon after coming back, within a couple of days," Corriveau said. "They were advised to avoid spreading. But at this point they have recovered, so, as far as I know, there is no reason to keep them from enjoying a normal life."</p>
<p>Public health staff have been monitoring the men's family members and everyone else they have seen since returning to Alberta.</p>
<p>No one is under official quarantine. Relatives are being asked to stay home as much as possible and avoid large crowds, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>Stelmach said the province has received word the federal government will beef up its tracking of foreign workers who may have come into contact with the influenza in Mexico.</p>
<p>"This is the season where we will see a lot of migrant workers coming to Alberta, to Canada," Stelmach said. "So we have to be very vigilant in making sure the protocols are in place and that we follow them."</p>
<p>Alberta Liberal Leader David Swann said it is key for the province to establish a seamless communications strategy, not only internally among health-care workers, but externally so the public understands what is happening, and emergency rooms aren't overwhelmed.</p>
<p>"We are in a serious state if this does manifest itself in a massive way," he said. "The problem is, do we have the resources to deal with it?"</p>
<p>Corriveau said it's important to keep the outbreak in perspective, because during a normal winter, up to 300 Albertans may die from regular forms of flu.</p>

<p>For the second day in a row, swine flu fears pulled down Canada'smainexchange.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSXCompositeIndexlost 46.77 points, or 0.50%, to 9348.03, with losers outpacing gainers almost two-to-one and seven of 10 subindices closing in negative territory. The <span class="companylink">TSX Venture Exchange</span> was also down, losing 9.88 points, or 0.99%, to 993.10. The Canadian dollar closed at US$0.8193, down sevenbasis points.</p>
<p>"Most of us didn't know what swine flu was four days ago," said Adrian Mastracci, portfolio manager with KCMWealth Management.</p>
<p>"Andnow, all of sudden, investors have one more worry to consider at a time when it is already difficult to gauge where markets andthe economy are headed." In Toronto, travel-related stocks continued to suffer. Air Canada was down 1.25%, <span class="companylink">Transat AT Inc</span>. lost 1.3% and WestJetAirlinesLtd. was unchanged.</p>
<p>Concern that a global outbreak of swine flu will delay an economic recovery has also impacted the price of commodities over the past two days. During yesterday's session, energy stocks fell 0.90% as oil prices dropped to US$49.92 a barrel, down US$0.22. The group, made up primarily of oil and gas companies, was also weighed down by <span class="companylink">UTS Energy Corp</span>. , whose shares lost 4%to $1.52 after TotalSA, Europe's third-largest oil company, withdrew its $830-million bid when it failed to get the minimumnumber of shares required.</p>
<p>Materials also fell, shedding 1.63% as gold prices declined US$14.60 to US$893.80 an ounce, while copper prices were unchanged.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Viterra Inc</span>. , Canada's largest grain handler, dropped 10% on news it is in talks to buy Australian-based ABBGrain Ltd. for asmuch as US$1.1-billion.</p>
<p>Gainers on Tuesday included the financials sector, despite concerns across the border that banks needmore capital.</p>
<p>Montreal-basedNovekoInternational Inc. was also higher, rising another 2.5%.</p>
<p>The company, which makes air filters and face masks, has risen almost 50% over the past two days.</p>
<p>In the U.S., stocks also retreated. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 8.05 points, or 0.10%, to 8016.95. The S&P 500 lost 2.35 points, or 0.27%, to 855.16 and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 5.60 points, or 0.33%, to 1673.81.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Bank of America Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Citigroup Inc</span>. slumped 8.63% and 5.86%, respectively, on a report that government stress testsmay show the banks needmore cashto shore up balance sheets.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines Inc</span>. , the largest U.S. airline, fell another 9.9% on flu concerns, and GeneralMotors Corp. tumbled 11% as bondholders saidaplan toexchange $27- billion indebt for equity is unreasonable.</p>

<p>POTENT BARCELONA SHOOTS BLANKS</p>
<p>BARCELONA -- Chelsea held Barcelona to a 0-0 tie in the opening game of their Champions League semifinal to become the first team to leave the Spanish league leader's Nou Camp stadium without conceding a goal in 28 matches this season. Two-time champion Barcelona, which has scored 94 times in the Spanish league, couldn't add to its tournament-leading 29 goals even after outshooting Chelsea 20-3. Chelsea hosts the return match on May 6, with the final set for May 27 in Rome. Defending champion Manchester United and Arsenal begin their semifinal today.</p>

<p>SIX BEIJING ATHLETES FAIL DOPE TESTS</p>
<p>LAUSANNE -- Eight months after the end of the Beijing Olympics, six athletes have failed doping tests after previously tested samples were re-checked, the International Olympic Committee said Tuesday. The samples were re-tested for CERA, a new version of an endurance-enhancing hormone. Names of the athletes have not yet been released, but one is reportedly a male gold medallist in track and field and the other a cyclist. Italian media identified the cyclist as Davide Rebellin, a silver medallist in the men's road race.</p>

<p>NEW YORK -- The New York Yankees reduced season-ticket prices for some premium seats by up to 50 per cent, offering refunds and free tickets to others who had already purchased seats at the new stadium for as much as $2,500 a game. The 2009 price adjustments are effective immediately for a few hundred seats at the $1.5-billion Yankee Stadium. The decision came more than three weeks after Yankees managing general partner Hal Steinbrenner said a small number of seats were overpriced because of economic conditions.</p>

<p>The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius as health secretary, filling a crucial spot in President Barack Obama's cabinet amid growing fears of a possible swine flu pandemic. The Senate voted 65-31 for Sebelius, brushing back Republican opposition to her support for abortion rights. Sebelius was tapped by Obama to lead his push to overhaul the U.S. health care system.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Global network of scientists race to develop vaccine for new flu, but it could take six months or longer; Until a vaccine is ready, Canada's primary line of defence will be the government's national stockpile of antiviral drugs</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>

</p>
<p>To vaccinate or not to vaccinate.</p>
<p>That is one of a host of difficult questions that Canadian public-health officials will face if the swine flu outbreak escalates.</p>
<p>In 1976, then U.S. president Gerald Ford ordered a national vaccination campaign in response to an outbreak of swine flu at a military base in New Jersey. In the end, only one person died from swine flu, while roughly 25 people died from a rare neurological syndrome believed to have been a side-effect of the vaccine. The program, now considered a case study in how not to handle a flu outbreak, cost roughly $500 million US in today's dollars.</p>
<p>Working with the World Health Organization, an international network of scientists is racing to develop a vaccine for the new swine flu strain. Canada is one of the few countries in the world that has a drug manufacturer on contract to supply the vaccine once it is developed.</p>
<p>But the Public Health Agency of Canada estimates it will take as long as six months to produce a vaccine, and some experts believe it could take longer.</p>
<p>"When everybody talks about six months, that's with no glitches. You start to get glitches, and all of a sudden you're fighting to solve problems," said Earl Brown, a flu specialist at the University of Ottawa's faculty of medicine.</p>
<p>Until a vaccine is ready, the primary line of defence will be the government's national stockpile of antiviral drugs. Unlike a vaccine, antivirals do not immunize patients from a flu strain, but they can relieve the symptoms, and some experts believe they can prevent infection and slow its spread.</p>
<p>Canada has stockpiled two antiviral drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza. The stockpile contains 55 million doses, which officials say is enough to treat the Canadians who will require medical treatment during a pandemic. But Canadian officials and medical experts warn the current swine flu strain could become resistant to such antivirals if the drugs are used on a wide scale too early.</p>
<p>"The good news so far is that the antivirals are working," said Dr. Robert Ouellet, president of the Canadian Medical Association. He cautioned that Canadians who haven't been exposed to the outbreak shouldn't look to antivirals as a preventive measure. "Some people will be afraid and will ask to have antivirals right now, even if they don't have the disease.... This is not something we should do."</p>
<p>Even with the stockpile, federal and provincial officials and health-care workers will have to decide on the fly how to coordinate testing for the flu, as well as how to distribute and administer the antivirals.</p>
<p>The logistical challenges would be even more daunting if a mass vaccination program becomes necessary. The Public Health Agency admits there would be many unknowns in the event of a pandemic, including the nature and severity of the flu strain, the availability and safety of a vaccine and the tone of the public's reaction.</p>
<p>For one thing, the government will have to decide who gets the vaccine first, a potentially explosive decision. The agency has identified several categories of people who would likely be first in line, including health-care workers, emergency responders and "key societal decision makers," but it says the decision would depend on the nature of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Despite such challenges, health officials and pandemic experts insist Canada is better prepared than during the SARS outbreak of 2003, which killed 44 Canadians and cost the economy an estimated $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>The outbreak prompted the creation of the Public Health Agency, which now coordinates Canada's pandemic plan.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Travel to Mexico slows almost to halt; Lone Mexican airline still operating to country; others suspend flights until outbreak is contained</b>

</p>
<p>The check-in counter at Mexicana airlines at Vancouver International Airport was quiet Tuesday afternoon as many travellers chose to cancel or change scheduled flights to Mexico because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Mexicana is one of the few airlines still flying to the beleaguered country, now the subject of a Canadian travel advisory warning against all non-essential travel there.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, Nolitours, Transat Holidays, <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span> and Sunwing Vacations have suspended all travel from Canada to Mexico until the outbreak is under control.</p>
<p>"The airlines are being quite flexible," said Marco Hernandez, president of the Vancouver-based travel agency Mexico Travel Link.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> and its partner tour companies have cancelled all flights to Mexico until June 1. People who were booked on those flights have until Oct. 31 of this year to use flight credits to travel anywhere the airline flies. Customers will be required to pay extra, however, if their new destination is more expensive than Mexico.</p>
<p>The policy is similar at <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span> and Sunwing Vacations, both of which cancelled flights to Mexico until June 4 and May 29, respectively.</p>
<p>Flights are still coming into Canada though, as tour operators bring home customers and employees who have been in Mexico.</p>
<p>Paul Graham and Jordan Myrol of Langley arrived on a flight from Mexico City on Tuesday afternoon. The pair had a one-night layover at the Mexico City airport on their way back from a vacation in Guatemala.</p>
<p>Neither of the young men were too concerned about the swine flu, but were surprised their airline did not provide masks on the flight or supply them with information about the outbreak.</p>
<p>"They didn't say anything to us," Graham said.</p>
<p>Myrol said he was asked at customs whether he had been sniffling or coughing recently, but there was no screening beyond that. Both men said they would immediately go to a doctor, however, if they noticed any flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Quarantine officers are regularly stationed at the airport to handle anyone who is exhibiting serious symptoms of illness, but no additional screening measures have been implemented since the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Border agents at airports have been directed to ask passengers if they have any of the swine flu symptoms -- fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, coughing, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhea -- or if they have been in contact with anyone who has symptoms, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Elimelec Galvez wore a mask as he waited at the airport Tuesday afternoon for his cousin to arrive from Mexico City.</p>
<p>"I'm just concerned. I know the risk is low, but I want to take precautions," Galvez said.</p>
<p>Dale Urquhart, director of travel services with BCAA, said anyone who was planning to go to Mexico in the coming weeks should talk directly to their travel provider to learn about their options.</p>
<p>"It's changing so quickly. Nothing is black and white," she said.</p>
<p>Air Canada and WestJet have waived their rebooking fees for all Mexico flights scheduled to depart from now until May 6 and May 8, respectively.</p>
<p>In other developments Tuesday, Mexico ordered the closure of all archeological sites -- such as world-famous Aztec and Mayan pyramids that are tourist favourites -- as part of a drive to end public gatherings.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carnival Cruise Lines said that it has also "decided to cancel calls at Mexican ports for all current sailings," representative Aly Bello said in an e-mail Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>"Additionally, we will cancel calls in Mexico for all voyages departing Thursday through Monday."</p>
<p>She said in "many cases" Carnival will be able to substitute the cancelled call with an alternative port.</p>
<p>Tour companies in Britain, France and Germany have canceled trips to Mexico, and Argentina and Cuba have banned all flights from Mexico for the next week.</p>

<p>DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p>CANADA: Now has 13 confirmed cases, all mild and all in people who had visited Mexico. New cases include a third case in B.C., two cases in Alberta and four in Ontario. Ontario said all people arriving at hospitals with respiratory ailments would be required to don a mask.</p>
<p>MEXICO: Mexico City has told all restaurants and cafes to stop serving sit-down customers and operate on a takeout basis only until at least May 6.</p>
<p>U.S.: The president asked Congress for another $1.5 billion to fight swine flu. The U.S. reported its first suspected cases where the person did not catch the illness in Mexico, but from someone who had been in Mexico. The confirmed caseload jumped to 65 people across six states (11 in California, two in Kansas, 45 in New York, one in Ohio, six in Texas, one in Indiana). Health officials said only five U.S. cases have required hospitalization, but they have said they expect more serious cases -- and possibly deaths -- as surveillance expands. In California, Texas and New York City, authorities have ordered schools shut where students have tested positive for the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>TRAVEL ALERTS: The governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Sri Lanka, Switzerland and the U.S. advise against travel to Mexico.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Masks won't fully shield you from infection; Respirators more effective than face masks, but experts can't say how helpful either device is</b>
</div><div>Shari Roan   </div>
<div>Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>563 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Don't count on those disposable masks to completely protect you against the swine flu percolating around the globe.</p>
<p>Many people in Mexico City, as well as travellers to and from there, have been seen wearing mouth and nose protection of one type or another in recent days.</p>
<p>Most were wearing face masks, which are loose-fitting and designed to help stop droplets from spreading from the person wearing the mask. They also protect the wearer's mouth and nose from splashes. They are not created to protect the wearer from breathing in very small particles.</p>
<p>Respirators, on the other hand, are made for just that. They are similar in appearance to the relatively inexpensive face masks but are designed to protect the wearer from breathing in particles. These masks, known as N95 for their filtering ability, fit more snugly on the face than face masks so that air is breathed through the filter. They work best if they are fitted to the person wearing the mask.</p>
<p>A respirator that fits snugly can filter out small particles that can be inhaled around the edges of a face mask. But it's easier to breathe through a face mask than a respirator over a long period of time, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention experts said.</p>
<p>Federal health officials said Monday that they don't know how helpful either device is in preventing swine flu infection.</p>
<p>If used correctly, masks and -- more likely -- respirators might reduce the risk of getting influenza, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>But for people who live in areas with confirmed cases, no single action will provide complete protection. It simply isn't practical to wear a mask all the time, and they are not 100-per-cent effective.</p>
<p>Face masks and respirators are most useful for people in crowded settings, such as classrooms or airplanes, to protect the mouth and nose from inhaling germs and to reduce the likelihood of coughing or sneezing on other people.</p>
<p>Face masks and respirators are often recommended for people in close contact with an infected person. "Close contact" is defined as a metre or less by the World Health Organization and two metres or less by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration.</p>
<p>Face masks and respirators should be worn once, according to the World Health Organization. Look for masks labeled for surgical, dental, medical procedure, isolation or laser use.</p>
<p>Health experts say that masks and respirators should be used along with other precautions, such as frequent hand-washing, covering coughs, staying at home if ill and avoiding crowds.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Third B.C. resident confirmed to have swine flu; Victoria woman who fell ill at a Cancun, Mexico, resort is 'fine' after testing at Royal Jubilee Hospital</b>
</div><div>Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun; With file from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>825 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>With another B.C. resident confirmed to have swine flu Tuesday, public health officials said it's reassuring there are only three cases in the province so far, a sign the virus is neither highly virulent nor contagious.</p>
<p>"It remains true that across Canada, there have been 13 cases, no hospitalizations and no deaths so far," said Dr. Danuta Skowronski of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control (BCCDC).</p>
<p>"However, we're monitoring for that possibility. We don't want to be complacent. I expect there to be more cases. I expect there may be hospitalizations and deaths. That's why we need to think ahead and prepare for that possibility."</p>
<p>B.C.'s third confirmed case is Michelle Bossi, 30, of Victoria, who fell ill at a Cancun resort last Thursday and went to Royal Jubilee Hospital for testing on her return home Saturday.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Bossi said Tuesday afternoon after learning that her test results had been confirmed by BCCDC earlier in the day.</p>
<p>However, Bossi is concerned she may have inadvertently spread the virus after health professionals told her Saturday she was not contagious.</p>
<p>'I'm annoyed I could have affected other people," she said.</p>
<p>But the Vancouver Island Health Authority said all protocols were followed and, even though the swine flu situation was still evolving when Bossi first went to the hospital, there were no undue infection risks as she waited in Royal Jubilee Hospital emergency department or later visited a walk-in clinic.</p>
<p>"Our emergency department responded as would be expected. The management was appropriate," said chief medical health officer Dr. Richard Stanwick.</p>
<p>Dr. Pamela Kibsey, VIHA medical director for microbiology and infection control, said those with the virus are most infectious the first two days, although they continue to be infectious for seven days, and Bossi was on her fourth day of illness before returning to Canada. That is also why initial tests, most effective in the first 48 hours of the illness, did not raise alarms, she said.</p>
<p>Skowronski refused to say how many other cases are now under investigation, a departure from a day earlier, when a BCCDC official said there were about six possible cases. The results of testing in those cases were not available Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Skowronski said the number of possible cases wouldn't be given because she doesn't want the public to get "fixated" on numbers. "Remember we have put our health care system on high alert to be detecting influenza-like illness and our lab is responding to increased requests for lab tests. We have a number of reports we're following up," she said, noting that results are usually back within 48 hours, once nasal swabs and blood are collected.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Sun has disclosed that two of the three confirmed cases acquired swine flu while on holiday in Cancun, but Skowronski said public health officials are sticking to their plan not to disclose where affected patients have been because "we don't want to mislead people into thinking there may be safe zones you can go in Mexico.</p>
<p>"As you know, Canada has now issued a travel health warning restricting non-essential travel to Mexico generally. We would prefer people to consider Mexico in its entirety as a possible risk area," she added.</p>
<p>The BCCDC's Dr. David Patrick said it is important to put into perspective the fact that each year, 400,000 to 800,000 B.C. residents get influenza, and as many as 1,400 die from it. Influenza outbreaks typically occur during winter months, so it is expected that even the swine influenza A (H1N1) should eventually fizzle out.</p>
<p>Until that happens, however, experts are reiterating the need for people with symptoms like fever and coughs to isolate themselves so as not to spread their germs.</p>
<p>Skowronski said she hopes the current public health threat helps change the culture so that if healthy bystanders see someone sick in schools or workplaces, they will say to the ill person: "'You don't look so good, maybe you should go home.'"</p>
<p>The swine influenza in humans is spread the same way as typical influenza -- through coughing, sneezing and germs on the hands. Symptoms of swine flu are also the same as common strains of influenza -- fever, lethargy, cough, lack of appetite, sore throat, runny nose, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

</p>
<p>It's likely beyond containment now, but to describe the Mexican swine flu outbreak as a potential rerun of the Spanish Influenza pandemic seems, subject to change without notice, wildly alarmist.</p>
<p>The 1918 influenza pandemic claimed 50,000 of Canada's eight million citizens, almost as many casualties as the First World War, while statistically shortening the average lifespan by 10 years. One doctor observed at the time that some patients "died struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth."</p>
<p>Yuck.</p>
<p>That virus hit with astonishing speed in an age before vaccines were mass produced. One newspaper reported that four women had been happily playing bridge late into the night. By the next morning, three were dead.</p>
<p>The Alberta government ordered all residents to wear masks outdoors that horrific autumn. A sneeze or a cough in a public place would cost you a fine in Regina. Funerals in the hardest-hit areas were limited to 15 minutes to clear the body backlog.</p>
<p>Today's swine flu is no 1918 influenza, so perish the comparison.</p>
<p>The infected number hit 13 across four provinces on Tuesday as the government ramped up a travel warning against going to Mexico.</p>
<p>At statistical face value, lathering up the current outbreak into an all-consuming global crisis, one that saw U.S President Barack Obama unleash $1.8 billion for American defences against the bug, seems ludicrous.</p>
<p>The Mexican health ministry says 1,995 Mexicans are being monitored for showing symptoms of the virus, but there are only 26 confirmed cases. The rest of the world combined has still not cracked into triple digits and symptoms have been so regular-flu mild, most victims are recovered before tests confirm they had the virus.</p>
<p>Even so, the WHO went to unprecedented Level 4 of its six-stage alert to signal a sustained human-to-human transmission virus is on the loose, riding jetstreams around the world with the capacity to deliver community-wide sickness.</p>
<p>The trouble with assessing pandemic responses is the impossibility of arguing against an abundance of precaution while the scale of the outbreak rages as hypothetical and expert opinion on its potential ranges from grave danger to a basic flu.</p>
<p>But the Government of Canada has so far taken a more reasonable response to the swine flu crisis than the American throw-more-money approach or the Asian travel bans to North America, admitting nervous concern and rushing to get a vaccine out without signs of dramatic panic.</p>
<p>While one opposition MP's proposal to strike a special committee to monitor the outbreak was correctly shrugged off by the government as pointless political posturing, questions of the government in the Commons have been a search for important information.</p>
<p>MPs on Tuesday merely wanted to know the potential timetable for a swine flu vaccine and asked if migrant workers from Mexico, who might be heading here for summer work, would be tested at the border.</p>
<p>Both are legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>Once-invisible Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has been a steady performer, delivering answers without partisan drama. She stands in favourable contrast to Quebec Premier Jean Charest, who see-sawed between a go and no-go position on travelling to Mexico on a single day.</p>
<p>The website by Health Canada, a federal department ironically born out of the 1918 pandemic, is informative and appears current.</p>
<p>The reaction by medical experts has been equally reassuring. When they know the answer, they give it. When they don't have solid data, they admit that, too, with a shrug. Deaths are likely as the outbreak spreads, they warned, but to suggest otherwise would be sugar-coating reality. Every year, 500 to 1,500 Canadians succumb to regular flu strains. It only stands to reason a more severe bug would have similar deadly consequences.</p>
<p>If nothing else, consider the bright side to this ruckus. If the pandemic fizzles, Mexican vacations next winter will be had at giveaway prices.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quarantine and the public good; History shows authorities must act decisively to take advantage of early goodwill toward strict pandemic control measures</b>
</div><div>Alexandra M. Stern and Howard Markel   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>1128 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>In Mexico, the swine flu is thought to have infected at least 1,995 people (and probably thousands more) and killed at least 149. Here in the United States, the swine flu has infected at least 65 people. The number is growing fast -- and spreading from border states like Texas and California to places like Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Ontario.</p>
<p>Is it time to panic? In a word, no. But it is time to prepare.</p>
<p>This epidemic is caused by a novel strain of influenza A/H1N1 virus. Predicting the progress of flu pandemics is fraught with problems, given the ease with which influenza spreads and its inherent biological unpredictability. It is too early to tell if the swine flu outbreak that began in central Mexico and has spread to more than 10 countries across the globe will reach the severity of the deadly 1918-1919 pandemic that killed approximately 55,000 in Canada, 675,000 in the United States, and 50 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Like then, we potentially are confronting a virus which appears to sicken and sometimes kill not only the very old and the very young, but those in the primes of their lives. However, due to developments in science and public health, we are in a much better position to weather this crisis. Scientists already have identified the strain of this new A/H1N1 virus, epidemiological surveillance is moving at a nearly instantaneous pace, and there exists at least a limited stockpile of anti-virals that can help treat those infected. Seed virus already has been collected to manufacture a swine flu vaccine in the months to come.</p>
<p>It is imperative that government authorities -- at the local, state, national and international levels -- monitor the situation, communicate with one another, and assure that they are ready to intervene immediately if evidence of a deadly pandemic emerges.</p>
<p>And this is precisely what's been happening. For example, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been in constant contact with Mexican health authorities, Health Canada, the health agencies of other affected nations, the World Health Organization, as well as local authorities in communities affected by the flu.</p>
<p>No matter what any expert tells you, it is unclear how this global health event will unfold in the weeks and months to come. But even if this is not the Hurricane Katrina of flu crises, it would be foolish not to use this situation to enhance pandemic preparedness. In reality, the alternative to over-reacting is under-reacting. And that is a prescription for disaster.</p>
<p>On April 28, Premier Dalton McGuinty declared that Ontario was well prepared to handle a swine flu outbreak having "learned the painful lessons of SARS six years ago." In case you forgot, it was then that Toronto became our hemisphere's epicentre for an outbreak which took the lives of 44 Canadians, infected over 400, and involved the home quarantine of thousands more. In the years since, Ontario and Toronto have worked diligently to develop pandemic preparedness plans and applied many lessons from that episode. The real test of the protocols they have developed will depend largely on the spread and progress of swine flu.</p>
<p>But even with the most sophisticated planning, hitting the sweet spot in epidemic control -- one that protects the most people from disease and minimizes disruptions to society -- is even tougher than hitting a fast ball thrown by a major league pitcher.</p>
<p>The greatest tension that erupted during the SARS epidemic in Toronto related to pushback against recommended home quarantines for the sick and the heavy responsibility placed on front-line health care professionals. Nearly nine decades earlier, during the 1918-1919 influenza pandemic, North American communities faced similar tensions when it came to restrictions on individual liberties during an extended health emergency.</p>
<p>Confronting escalating cases and deaths in the fall of 1918, communities had to decide whether and when the public health measures that today we term non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) -- such as quarantine and public gathering bans -- should be voluntary or mandatory and, if decreed by law, how they could be enforced fairly and effectively. Communities in Canada and the United States navigated these tricky decisions as they determined when and if to shutter schools, how to close theatres and business establishments without inciting panic, and how to encourage volunteers, above all women who were seen as natural caretakers, to nurse the ill.</p>
<p>The historical record and recent studies of pandemic awareness suggest that the majority of people will acquiesce to if not embrace voluntary NPI. Compliance with home quarantine was very high during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Toronto. Furthermore, a 2006 health survey conducted by Harvard University indicates that most Americans voluntarily would sequester themselves at home during a severe pandemic for at least one month. Today, one is impressed by the willingness of most Mexico City citizens to wear the face masks that the police have been distributing.</p>
<p>It is heartening that many people, due to a combination of self interest and civic duty, are willing to comply with voluntary NPI, at least for certain periods of time. Such goodwill, however, can evaporate quickly when government officials institute mandatory NPI, particularly if such orders are not communicated well.</p>
<p>In 1918, a mandatory face mask ordinance in San Francisco was met with protests, scoff-laws, and time-consuming arrests. One of the lessons from 1918 is that officials should be careful not to squander the first instance of implementation when community receptivity is likely to be the highest. The 1918 experience reveals numerous instances when NPI were activated, de-activated, and then re-activated, ultimately leading to skepticism or fatigue among city residents.</p>
<p>In the end, the effective management of the swine flu of 2009 will require a solid foundation of public health science that is acted upon with high degrees of inter-agency co-ordination, transparent communication, and civic co-operation.</p>
<p>Regardless of the outcome of this crisis, we all need to do our part to co-exist in a world stalked by newly emerging and deadly infectious diseases.</p>

</div><div>Chris Ayres, Tim Reid and Matt Spence   </div>
<div>The Times, London</div>
<div>798 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>A U.S.-owned pig farm in the Mexican state where the first swine flu cases were detected came under pressure to release internal documents about its waste-handling practices Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Attention has focused on Granjas Carroll de Mexico, a subsidiary of <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods</span>, which operates several large-scale pig farms near the village of La Gloria in the state of Veracruz.</p>
<p>The first known swine flu sufferer, a four-year-old boy named Edgar Hernandez, is from the state.</p>
<p>The boy has made a full recovery, although the virus has since killed an estimated 149 people in Mexico, caused nearly 2,000 others to fall ill, and prompted the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic threat level to four on a scale of one to six.</p>
<p>Although officials from the WHO have said that it is too early to pinpoint the origins of the virus, residents of La Gloria have been complaining since March that the odour from "manure lagoons" created by Granjas Carroll were causing severe respiratory infections.</p>
<p>This month, before swine flu emerged as a global threat, they held a demonstration at which they carried signs of pigs crossed with an X and marked with the word Peligro -- danger.</p>
<p>Now they say that they live at the "ground zero" of the crisis.</p>
<p>It has been claimed that several hundred of the town's 3,000 residents have fallen ill, and that three children under the age of two have died.</p>
<p>The bodies have not been exhumed, although there is increasing pressure on the Mexican government to carry out testing to isolate the source of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Residents of La Gloria have long complained that their concerns -- such as swarms of flies being attracted to the manure -- have not been taken seriously.</p>
<p>Jose Luis Martinez, 34, a resident of La Gloria, said that when he heard about the swine outbreak he recognized immediately the symptoms of fever, coughing, aching joints, severe headaches and, in some cases, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>"When we saw it on the television, we said to ourselves, 'This is what we had'," he said. "It all came from here ... the symptoms they are suffering are the same that we had here."</p>
<p>Not everyone is so convinced. Local health officials and Health Minister Jose Cordova have downplayed claims that the swine flu epidemic could have started in La Gloria, noting that of 30 mucous samples taken from victims of respiratory diseases there, only one -- that of Edgar Hernandez -- came back positive.</p>
<p>The deaths of the three children have been described by officials as isolated and unrelated.</p>
<p>The Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. said Tuesday that although it was helping the Mexican government with its investigation it could not discuss its operations, if any, in La Gloria.</p>
<p>Smithfield declined to comment on the request by the Veracruz legislature for internal documents, saying that it would not respond to rumours.</p>
<p>It said that the company had found no clinical signs or symptoms of the presence of swine influenza in its pig herd or in its employees at any of its joint ventures in Mexico.</p>
<p>The company -- which supplies the <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> and Subway fast-food chains -- was fined $12.3 million in 1997 for violating the Clean Water Act.</p>

<p>Air Canada and WestJet joined the airlines and tour operators suspending or altering travel to Mexico as the sun destination grapples with a swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>All travel from Canada to Mexico has been suspended by <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, Nolitours, Transat Holidays, <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span> and Sunwing Vacations.</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, Air Canada said it "currently plans to maintain flights to Mexico City," although it said customers with reservations for travel to or from Mexico City up to May 6 may rebook or cancel their travel arrangements without penalty.</p>
<p>However, the statement said, "Air Canada and Air Canada Vacations will suspend all operations to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta until June 1."</p>
<p>Calgary-based WestJet airline also issued a travel advisory to its clients Tuesday, saying it will cease service to Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, effective May 4.</p>
<p>It said service will resume to Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta on June 20. Service to Cancun, a seasonal destination for WestJet, will return in the fall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carnival Cruise Lines said that it has also "decided to cancel calls at Mexican ports for all current sailings," spokeswoman Aly Bello said in an e-mail Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>Travel agents were scrambling to juggle vacation plans Tuesday, switching customer's Mexican vacations to other sun destinations such as Cuba and Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>Air Canada and WestJet joined the airlines and tour operators suspending or altering travel to Mexico as the sun destination grapples with a swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The news came after travel from Canada to Mexico had been suspended by <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, Nolitours, Transat Holidays, <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span> and Sunwing Vacations.</p>
<p>Marlin Travel agent Brenda Nobel said they have been receiving e-mails and calls from people asking questions about their options due to the concern over the swine flu outbreak in Mexico.</p>
<p>Nobel said, so far -- since the Canadian government has not issued a blanket ban on travel to Mexico -- travellers cannot receive a full refund on their trips, even if they have travel insurance.</p>
<p>However, she said, tour operators are allowing clients to switch destinations.</p>
<p>"Air Canada and WestJet ... were offering no penalties for anyone that wanted to change. ... Sunquest just cancelled all of their groups until June 4. So when you call, you won't get your money back, but you will get your trip altered with no penalty," Nobel said, adding the customer will only have to pay "the difference" for destinations that usually cost more, like Jamaica.</p>
<p>She said "cancellation insurance does not kick in until the government puts a ban on the country," and she urged travellers to monitor the Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada website.</p>
<p>So far, the department has issued an official warning against non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Algonquin Travel agent Nikita Mathura says she dealt with about 10 customers over the past couple of days who had plans to travel to Mexico in May.</p>
<p>Like Marlin Travel, she says Algonquin Travel is not cancelling trips, just rebooking clients to different destinations.</p>
<p>"What will happen is we will give them a different destination that is available for the dates that they are allowed to go on," Mathura said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Carnival Cruise Lines said that it has also "decided to cancel calls at Mexican ports for all current sailings," spokeswoman Aly Bello said in an e-mail Tuesday evening.</p>

<p>An Ottawa man who returned from a Mexico honeymoon last week brought back more than snapshots and knick-knacks.</p>
<p>Marc Dazé, 37, touched down in Ottawa last Wednesday with a worrying fever that quickly left him gasping for breath.</p>
<p>He now believes he will be among the first confirmed cases of swine flu in the province -- and the first in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"I can't see it being anything else," Dazé said in a telephone interview yesterday.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, confirmed the first four cases of swine flu in the province. Three Ontario women and one man -- all in their 20s -- are said to have suffered mild illness and are at home recovering. The four cases are in Durham and York regions, just outside Toronto.</p>
<p>The cases bring the total number of swine flu cases in Canada to 13.</p>
<p>Williams said the four Ontario swine flu patients had all recently returned from Mexico suffering from "cough, respiratory problems and a fever."</p>
<p>"We're expecting there are more cases out there," he told reporters. "The good news is the cases we've seen in the United States and Canada have been mild."</p>
<p>"News of the flu is moving faster than the flu is," said Dr. Vivek Goel, head of Ontario's Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>The swine flu virus is behind as many as 149 deaths in Mexico and is suspected of sickening more than 1,900 in the country.</p>
<p>'Like An Asthma Attack'</p>
<p>When Dazé woke up with a sore throat last Tuesday, he thought he had caught a cold from the air conditioning in his Cancun hotel room.</p>
<p>"It was so hot and humid there, I thought maybe I turned the air conditioning too low that night," he says.</p>
<p>The coughing soon gave way to feverish symptoms. He suffered through an uncomfortable plane ride home, sweating and coughing all the way. By Thursday morning, Dazé's breathing was so bad he decided to visit the hospital.</p>
<p>"My chest pretty much closed right down on me," he says, coughing. "I would walk four or five feet and I'd have to pause to get my breath. It's like an asthma attack."</p>
<p>At the time, Dazé, an Internet technician for an Ottawa-based charitable organization, hadn't heard anything about the swine flu virus that has since sparked worldwide panic. Staff at The Ottawa Hospital's General campus clearly had.</p>
<p>"I said I just got back from Mexico and I just want to make sure I didn't catch a bug. I think that must have set off alarms ... I was sitting there for less than a minute and they took me into an isolation room right away."</p>
<p>He spent 12 hours in the hospital while doctors took swabs and ran a battery of breathing and blood tests on him, then asked to leave.</p>
<p>"They wanted to keep me in for observation," he says. "Maybe it was the wrong decision, but they told me if there were any other symptoms -- anything -- I should come right back in."</p>
<p>Since then, he has stayed at home in a self-imposed -- and fearful -- quarantine. As news of a new global flu pandemic spread, Dazé and his wife, Yvonne Léger, feel they have been left in the dark.</p>
<p>The couple is upset by what they see as poor communication by local public health officials. "I feel like I've been given the runaround," he says. "Everyone tells me to call someone else. I think I should be put on a little higher priority."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, he tried to get information from a provincial hotline set up specially to deal with swine flu concerns.</p>
<p>"The woman told me no news is good news," he said. "I mean, give me a break. That's ridiculous."</p>
<p>Williams, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, has said lab results are taking four to five days to turn around.</p>
<p>Dazé is heartened to hear Canadians are suffering milder variants of the new illness. "I'm not as worried about it. But I'd still like to know."</p>
<p>Both local and provincial officials refused to discuss Dazé's case, citing privacy concerns. A spokeswoman for The Ottawa Hospital couldn't confirm he was a patient there last week.</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, ignored several requests for an interview.</p>
<p>Dazé's wife is scheduled to return to work today. While she hasn't shown any symptoms, she wants to know if she will be putting anyone at risk.</p>
<p>"It's kind of scary," she says about the experience. "It's not something you want to go through."</p>
<p>Screening Increased</p>
<p>Canada stepped up its screening measures at airports Tuesday to check passengers returning from Mexico for swine flu symptoms amid news that the virus has infected 13 Canadians in four provinces.</p>
<p>Seven new cases were confirmed Tuesday -- two in Alberta, the four in Ontario and one in British Columbia -- adding to six announced Sunday. All have links with travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Canadians who choose to maintain their travel plans to Mexico, despite a travel warning issued Monday by the Public Health Agency of Canada to delay trips if possible, will face questions about their health from customs officers upon their return. Border agents at airports have been directed to ask passengers if they have any of the swine flu symptoms -- fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, coughing, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhea -- or if they have been in contact with anyone who has symptoms.</p>
<p>If anyone answers "yes," they will be assessed further and possibly referred to a quarantine officer who may then advise travellers to go home and self-isolate or go to a hospital.</p>
<p>"These measures will help to prevent further spread and protect the health of Canadians and we thank you for your patience and co-operation with this process," Dr. David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer, said here Tuesday at a news conference.</p>
<p>Airline passengers will also receive handouts with information about swine flu and will hear public service announcements on the plane.</p>
<p>The new Canadian cases reported Tuesday came as no surprise to health officials.</p>
<p>"Today's new cases were anticipated by the government and by public health officials and they do not change our course of action," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said at a news conference.</p>
<p>The health minister said the federal government is following a six-point plan to deal with the swine flu outbreak, and is "on top of what is happening."</p>
<p>World health authorities are warning the swine flu outbreak could develop into a pandemic. Its spread around the globe and its person-to-person transmission prompted the World Health Organization on Monday afternoon to heighten its global pandemic alert system from level three to four.</p>
<p>WHO said the change is a signal that the world is a step closer to a pandemic, but that one is not inevitable.</p>
<p>Researchers are struggling to understand why the virus, which has a genetic makeup that has never been seen before, has been deadly only in Mexico and why it seems to severely affect relatively young and healthy people.</p>
<p>WHO said even if countries are successful in mitigating the spread of the virus and its incidence goes down, it likely will be months before the outbreak can be declared over.</p>
<p>"It will be very hard to know whether this virus has actually disappeared until several months have gone by at the very least," said Fukuda. "That's the nature of this infection and that is something we will be on the lookout for."</p>

<p>Highlights of Canada's Pandemic Flu Plan:</p>
<p>Canada produced its first detailed pandemic flu plan in 1988, and now updates it every few years. A global flu pandemic typically occurs three or four times each century (the last being the Hong Kong flu of 1968-69), but public-health officials say it is all but impossible to predict when the next will occur. In a "moderately severe" pandemic scenario, 4.5 million to 10.6 million Canadians would fall ill, and 11,000 to 58,000 Canadians would die, public-health officials estimate. Here are some highlights of Canada's plan, which is overseen by the Public Health Agency of Canada:</p>
<p>- Surveillance and alerts: Federal officials would enhance surveillance of flu strains by a network of labs across the country, and push information to the public through updates on the Public Health Agency's website.</p>
<p>- Vaccine: Canada is one of few countries in the world that has a contract with a private drug manufacturer (<span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>) to produce enough flu vaccine for all Canadians. However, supply could initially be scarce, since it could take up to six months to produce a vaccine, so the plan calls for health-care workers and those at high risk to receive the vaccine first.</p>
<p>- Antivirals: Millions of doses of antiviral drugs, which can reduce symptoms and slow the reproduction of the virus, have already been distributed to the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>- Isolation and quarantine: Infected individuals will be isolated at home or hospitals, but officials say it is not feasible to quarantine everyone who may have been exposed. In certain cases, authorities may decide to close schools and daycares.</p>
<p>- Communications: Federal officials have developed a national communications plan to ensure Canadians receive accurate information about the pandemic as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>- Co-ordination: Other federal departments and agencies could be called into action through Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness Canada, an interdepartmental body created after 9/11.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization has raised its pandemic alert for swine flu to the second highest level, meaning that it believes a global outbreak of the disease is imminent.</p>
<p>WHO says the phase 5 alert means there is sustained human-to-human spread in at least two countries.</p>
<p>It also signals that efforts to produce a vaccine will be ramped up.</p>
<p>WHO has confirmed human cases of swine flu in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Britain, Israel, New Zealand and Spain.</p>
<p>Mexico and the United States have reported deaths.</p>
<p>WHO Director-General Margaret Chan made the decision today to raise the alert level from phase 4 — signifying transmission in only one country — after reviewing the latest scientific evidence on the outbreak.</p>
<p>Dr. Chan urged international cooperation and encouraged countries to view the raised alert level as an opportunity to ramp up efforts to contain the virus.</p>
<p>"It really is all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic," Dr. Chan said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Ontario, there are three new confirmed cases, bringing the provincial total to seven. British Columbia also reported three new cases, bringing the total to 19 confirmed cases in Canada.</p>
<p>Officials at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control say all the new cases are in the Vancouver region.They say five of the six cases were people who were travelling recently in Mexico, but health officials say the transmission link in one of case is unclear.</p>
<p>One person in B.C. was hospitalized overnight but nationwide, all cases have been described by health officials as mild.</p>
<p>Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting Chief Medical Officer of Health, said at a media briefing that two of the individuals who tested positive on Wednesday recently travelled to Mexico. He said it is still not clear whether the third individual visited Mexico.</p>
<p>All seven individuals in the province live in the suburbs surrounding Toronto, are in their twenties and suffered mild symptoms.</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised at all," with the number of cases, Dr. Williams told reporters.</p>
<p>"I expect some more as the days go on."</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the World Health Organization said it was moving closer to raising the pandemic alert level once again as the swine flu outbreak continued to hop from one country to the next and claimed its first life outside of Mexico, the epicentre of the disease.</p>
<p>"It's clear that the virus is spreading and we don't see any evidence of this slowing down at this point," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, WHO acting assistant director-general, said in a conference call from Geneva.</p>
<p>Government officials confirmed the first U.S. death from the new H1N1 swine flu today - a 23-month-old child who died in Texas. It is the first death from swine flu reported outside Mexico, the country hardest hit by the influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>"This is quite sad news," Dr. Richard Besser, the acting director of the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control, told a morning teleconference.</p>
<p>"As a parent, as a pediatrician, I am moved by this and my heart goes out to the family in Texas who is dealing with this situation."</p>
<p>The official number of those infected in the United States climbed to 91 today from 64 the day before, and there are now confirmed cases in 10 states, up from five on Tuesday. But, said Dr. Besser, those numbers are out of date even as they are being released.</p>
<p>Germany confirmed its first cases of swine flu today: a 22-year-old woman hospitalized in Hamburg, a man in his late 30s at a hospital in Regensburg, north of Munich, and a 37-year-old woman from another Bavarian town. All three had recently returned from Mexico. And Austria health ministry said a 28-year-old woman who recently returned from a month-long trip to Guatemala via Mexico City and Miami has the virus but is recovering.</p>
<p>The WHO raised the pandemic level to 4 on Monday, the first time since the system was devised four years ago. Level 6 is a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>Swine flu is suspected of killing more than 150 people in Mexico and sickening over 2,400 there. The city's mayor said the outbreak seemed to be stabilizing and he was considering easing the citywide shutdown that closed schools, restaurants, concert halls and sports arenas.</p>
<p>But as fear and uncertainty continued around the world, nations took all sorts of precautions, some more useful than others.</p>
<p>Britain closed a school after a 12-year-old girl was found to have the disease. Egypt slaughtered all its pigs and the central African nation of Gabon became the latest nation to ban pork imports, despite assurances that swine flu was not related to eating pork.</p>
<p>Cuba eased its flight ban, deciding just to block flights coming in from Mexico. Asian nations greeted returning airport travellers with teams of medical workers and carts of disinfectants, eager to keep swine flu from infecting their continent.</p>
<p>And in the House of Commons in Ottawa, the human resources director said extra cleaning is being done in high-traffic areas and places where the public can visit, just in case. Additional hand sanitizer stations are also being installed.</p>
<p>Both Canada and United States this week issued advisories, urging that all unnecessary trips to Mexico be cancelled or postponed.</p>
<p>Until today's death in the United States, the cases outside of Mexico have been relatively mild. The swine flu virus has similar symptoms as seasonal influenza, including fever and joint aches.</p>
<p>Dr. Fukuda said health officials are at a loss to explain why those in Mexico are suffering more severe symptoms than others elsewhere in the world.</p>
<p>But he cautioned: "It's probably premature to think of this as a mild pandemic, [or] as a severe pandemic. It's very clear that we cannot predict what the course of this will be."</p>
<p>Dr. Besser at the CDC characterized this time as "a pre-pandemic period."</p>
<p>"What you call this matters much less than what you do about it. And we are being aggressive in our efforts," he said.</p>
<p>The cases in the U.S., like those in Canada, have been milder than Mexico, but "as we continue to look for cases, we expect to see more cases in a broader spectrum — and that is what we are seeing," said Dr. Besser.</p>
<p>The disease originated in pigs. But health authorities in the U.S. are going to start referring to it as the 2009 H1N1 virus, rather than swine flu, to halt any misconception that it can be spread by eating pork.</p>
<p>Ordinary influenza normally claims 36,000 lives in the United States, which prompted reporters to ask why there has been so much attention paid to this particular virus.</p>
<p>American health officials explained that it is a virus that has never been seen before, which means there is no background immunity in the population, and it is spreading from human to human. That means it has the potential to become a pandemic.</p>
<p>"At the start of an outbreak, you don't know what the course is going to look like," Dr. Besser said. "You don't know if this is a virus that is going to fizzle out in a couple of weeks or one that is going to become more or less severe in the diseases it causes."</p>
<p>The American border will remain open. But, as in Canada, customs officials will be actively looking of people who are sick.</p>

</p>
<p>For Pauline Rafferty, chief executive of the Royal B.C. Museum, it's not just a stroll through a new gallery but a walk through the history of mankind spanning 1.5 million years.</p>
<p>But for the Victoria tourism industry, the RBCM's special exhibit, Treasures: The World's Cultures from the British Museum, which opens Friday, is a key component to buoying the sector amid both economic uncertainty and the latest in a series of challenges to be thrown at the tourism industry -- the swine flu.</p>
<p>"The museum plays a big role, period, it has a great draw locally and on the Island," said Rob Gialloreto, CEO of Tourism Victoria. "It gives people a reason to come here. They already know Victoria is a great place, but the museum makes us a much stronger competitor."</p>
<p>And the rest of the industry seems to know it and has jumped on the opportunity to both promote and be associated with a major draw.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Treasures exhibit, which offers 309 pieces including 1.5-million year-old handaxes from Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania and art work from Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse, a number of local hotels and stores are offering Treasures-themed packages.</p>
<p>Hotels like the Fairmont Empress, Grand Pacific and Laurel Point Inn are offering accommodation and food and beverage combinations, while Skanda jewellers is creating original jewelry inspired by the collection.</p>
<p>"Our [industry] partners are in Treasures mode," said Gialloreto, noting his travel media department is also working publications and trade shows to drive coverage of the event.</p>
<p>It has paid off in the past.</p>
<p>The Titanic exhibit in 2007, which drew 451,120 visitors, was credited with bringing $30.2 million in extra spending to Victoria, eclipsing the $16.1 million generated by the 416,000 visitors to the Leonardo da Vinci exhibit in 1999.</p>
<p>The museum is anticipating in excess of 300,000 visits which would more than cover the $3 million cost of staging the exhibit.</p>
<p>"The Royal B.C. Museum has an impact all the time, and when you see the tourism community get behind things like this, you know they are going to see the change on their bottom line," said Rafferty. "They get behind it because it makes good business sense."</p>
<p>At this point of the year, revenue from visitors is slightly ahead of last year's pace, according to figures from Chemistry Consulting and indicates a good season ahead, but there's nothing set in stone as tourists now tend to book just before travelling so there's little indication via reservations of what the summer months will bring.</p>
<p>"We're doing damn well compared to last year. We've a safe location, seen as friendly, it's beautiful and an ideal oasis in the midst of chaos in the world," said Frank Bourree, tourism industry consultant with Chemistry Consulting.</p>
<p>And that will be key in weathering the latest storm caused by swine flu that has resulted in travel advisories from some countries suggesting travellers avoid Canada where there have been confirmed cases.</p>
<p>"Every year there's something new thrown at us whether it's SARS, the price of oil, the rising dollar, it's always a changing landscape," said Bourree, who said generally Victoria has been quick to respond to these challenges.</p>
<p>Still, Victoria is a destination constantly in transition and the industry and travellers are changing -- they are booking closer to their travel dates, looking for value and want experiences and not just a pretty place to see.</p>
<p>The origin of those tourists may also be changing.</p>
<p>Gialloreto said the industry is looking at emerging markets like India to make up for the shortfall from traditionally strong markets like the U.K..</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Airlines, tour operators cancel flights to Mexico; Swine flu prompts travel advisory</b>
</div><div>Scott Deveau </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>796 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>Travel to Mexico was abruptly curtailed yesterday following an edict from Ottawa to limit non-essential trips to the country because of an outbreak of swine flu that has killed more than 150 people.</p>
<p>The warning prompted Air Canada to cancel all of its flights to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta until the end of May, and offer to re-book or cancel existing reservations to Mexico City without penalty.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. said it would halt all of its flights to the country until June 20, and offered a full refund or to re-book flights for those scheduled to depart during that period.</p>
<p>The announcements followed similar ones earlier in the day by Canada's travel tour operators, who abruptly cancelled all of their service to Mexico until the end of May, upsetting the holiday plans of thousands of Canadians.</p>
<p>Carnival Cruises also announced it was ceasing some of its stops in the country.</p>
<p>All of the swine flu cases have links with travel to Mexico, where the illness is suspected of sickening more than 1,600.</p>
<p>The spread of the disease beyond Mexico's borders has prompted countries around the world to impose travel bans.</p>
<p>Cuba suspended flights to and from Mexico for 48 hours. In France, two national associations representing tour companies and travel agents said they were halting all departures for Mexico, "in agreement with all retailers and main travel agents offering trips to Mexico" due to the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>In Britain, travel firms grounded flights to Mexico and suspended trips to the resort of Cancun yesterday. And Germany's leading tourism group <span class="companylink">TUI</span> has said it would cancel Mexico City visits until May 5.</p>
<p>The Canadian announcements kept travel agencies busy yesterday as customers scrambled to find what had become of their vacation plans.</p>
<p>"We've had a lot of calls over the weekend, which were more inquiries. But today there has been a lot of actual re-booking and other changes," said Allison Wallace, Flight Centre Canada spokeswoman. She said hundreds of Flight Centre customers had planned to fly to Mexico this week.</p>
<p>Few, however, will likely be as affected by the news as Sherry Wasserman, whose daughter, Amanda, intends to be married in Mexico in two weeks.</p>
<p>Ms. Wasserman has been planning her daughter's wedding at the family's favourite holiday destination in Los Zacotitos for the better part of a year. And while she is committed to making the trip, she has serious concerns that many of their 46 guests won't be able to join them.</p>
<p>"I'll know by this weekend who will cancel," she said. "Everything's in limbo and my daughter's in tears."</p>
<p>Canadian officials issued the travel warning late Monday and led members of the Canadian Association of Tour Operators, including <span class="companylink">Transat A. T</span>., Sunwing Vacations, <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span> and <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span>, to abruptly cancel all their flights to the country until the end of May, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Passengers, including those of Air Canada Vacations, are, however, able to postpone their trips or rebook their trips to other destinations.</p>
<p>However, covering the difference in the cost rests on the shoulders of the consumer, and no refunds were being offered by the packaged-tour operators.</p>
<p>The news came as a blow to consumers, who were still reeling from the collapse of Conquest Vacations Inc. earlier this month.</p>
<p>"We were forced to do it because of the decision by the Canadian government," said</p>
<p>Stephen Hunter, the head of operations at Sunwing. "Once the government puts something like that out, there's no possible way that we could tell people they have to go somewhere."</p>
<p>Mr. Hunter expressed frustration over the blanket travel warning issued by Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>He said it is the same sort of move that decimated travel to all parts of Canada after an outbreak of SARS isolated Toronto in 2003.</p>
<p>"They painted the whole thing with the same brush, and the same thing is happening in Mexico," he said.</p>
<p>Sunwing, however, along with many of its competitors, is in the process of redeploying their Mexico flights to destinations in Cuba, the Dominican Republic and other Caribbean destinations in order to accommodate those who still wish to travel south.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only silver lining is that fewer travellers will be affected than would have been a month ago. Tour operators are in the midst of switching to summer schedules, which sees them switch their flights from sunny locales to other destinations in Canada and overseas.</p>
<p>Transat, for instance, had 45 weekly flights to Mexico last week, but only had 18 planned for next week, according to a company spokesman.</p>

<p>Shawn Hansen is hoping the swine flu outbreak fizzles and doesn't escalate into a full-blown pandemic that could closed Canada's borders to Mexican farm labourers.</p>
<p>As owner of Craven Riverside Gardens, a commercial market garden operation, Hansen is dependent on farm labourers from Mexico to help harvest his potato and vegetable crops.</p>
<p>"I don't think they (immigration officials) know how bad it is going to be yet. I was just listening to the province's chief medical health officer and I think the feeling is that in a week's time they will know how severe this is going to be -- whether it is going to continue to spread or is something that is going to play itself out,'' Hansen said Tuesday in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>Hansen said the Mexican Consulate in Vancouver sent him a circular instructing his Mexican fieldworkers to notify him if they become ill so that he can get them to a doctor to ensure they don't have swine flu.</p>
<p>Hansen said two Mexican fieldworkers, who have been working for him since late March, appear to be fine and symptom free. Another two workers are scheduled to arrive May 7 and at the peak of harvest he will have 10 Mexican farm labourers working for his operation.</p>
<p>While the swine flu outbreak may be a concern for his Canadian employees, Hansen said his Mexican help don't appear to be overly concerned about the outbreak which is concentrated mainly in Mexico City.</p>
<p>"Their greatest worry is what is happening to their families back home in Mexico,'' he said.</p>
<p>Hansen is monitoring the situation because if the outbreak continues to get worse the next wave of workers could get held back at the Mexican border.</p>
<p>"We are keeping our fingers crossed. Hopefully this doesn't blow up into something more serious,'' he said.</p>
<p>They are screening all workers getting on planes to come to Canada --taking their temperatures two days before they leave and again on the morning of their departure, he said, adding if workers ill they are pulled from the foreign farm labour program until they recover.</p>
<p>"If the workers are stopped at the border (market gardeners reliant on these workers) will be in a real jam,'' he said.</p>
<p>"We would probably have to leave some crop in the field if we don't have access to these workers. The reason we bring in Mexican farm labourers is because we can't hire Canadian workers to begin with. So there really are very few options.''</p>

<p>Air Canada and WestJet joined the airlines and tour operators suspending or altering travel to Mexico as the sun destination grapples with a swine flu outbreak possibly linked to more than 150 deaths.</p>
<p>All travel from Canada to Mexico has been suspended by <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, Nolitours, Transat Holidays, <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span> and Sunwing Vacations.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> said Tuesday all flights to Mexico with the airline and its partner tour companies have been cancelled until June 1.</p>
<p>The company said a May 3 flight from Mexico to Canada will go ahead as planned, with more returning flights announced shortly "in order to bring home its customers, passengers and employees now in Mexico."</p>
<p>Passengers have until Oct. 31 to use a flight credit for travel anywhere <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> flies, the airline said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span>, operated by the <span class="companylink">Thomas Cook Group</span>, also cancelled flights to Mexico until June 4. Customers with these bookings will receive a credit toward any flight or vacation with the tour operator to be used any time up to Oct. 31, 2009.</p>
<p>Sunwing Vacations has suspended all flights to Mexico until May 29.</p>
<p>With all these tour operators, customers will not be entitled for a refund and will be asked to pay the difference if their next trip is more expensive than the one to Mexico.</p>
<p>Late Tuesday, Air Canada said it "currently plans to maintain flights to Mexico City," although it said customers with reservations for travel to or from Mexico City up to May 6, may rebook or cancel their travel arrangements without penalty.</p>
<p>However, the statement said "Air Canada and Air Canada Vacations will suspend all operations to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta until June 1."</p>
<p>The airline said customers booked to travel to those destinations between April 28 and June 1, 2009, inclusive, can rebook their holiday with no change fees.</p>
<p>More than one million Canadians go to Mexico each year, spending an annual $13 billion in that country.</p>

</p>
<p>The Canadian Blood Services (CBS) is closely monitoring the latest developments in the global outbreak of swine flu, but it is business as usual at blood clinics across the country.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, there were no confirmed cases of swine flu in Saskatchewan, although 10 cases are under investigation. Nationally there are 13 confirmed cases in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario and Nova Scotia</p>
<p>"Obviously safety of the blood supply is our number one priority,'' said blood services spokeswoman Lindy McIntyre.</p>
<p>"But at the present time, there is no additional risk to the blood supply requiring extra screening measures and that is because there has been no reported cases of blood-transfusion transmission of respiratory viruses such as influenza to date.''</p>
<p>Influenza is spread primarily through direct contact and also by droplets in the air generated by infected people coughing or sneezing, McIntyre said.</p>
<p>"That said, individuals who may be infected with a cold or flu or who are not feeling well and have visited Mexico recently should wait two weeks before coming to a blood donor clinic,'' McIntyre said.</p>
<p>"I guess the incubation period is one to seven days and because it is a short period, it is unlikely that an individual infected (with the swine flu) in Mexico, would returned to Canada and then come to a clinic to donate within that short a time frame.''</p>
<p>While donors who are sick wouldn't likely come in to donate, she said donors with mild fevers would be screened and deferred.</p>
<p>Donors who visited Mexico recently but are feeling well and symptom free can donate blood provided they have not visited a malaria endemic area of Mexico, she added.</p>
<p>CBS is part of an international surveillance group that is closely monitoring world flu activity to anticipate potential threats to the blood system and put protective measures in place.</p>
<p>"In the event of an influenza pandemic, the principal threat to the blood system is Canada's ability to collect sufficient quantities of blood to meet the need of Canadian patients,'' McIntyre said.</p>
<p>A lack of donors and employee absenteeism during a pandemic may affect blood services ability to collect, test, process and distribute blood, she noted.</p>
<p>"Protecting Canada's blood supply is our top priority,'' she said, noting blood services has contingency plans prepared should the current swine flu outbreak escalate into a full-blown pandemic.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada stepped up its screening measures at airports Tuesday to check passengers returning from Mexico for swine flu symptoms amid news that the virus has now infected 13 Canadians in four different provinces.</p>
<p>Seven new cases were confirmed Tuesday -- two in Alberta, four in Ontario and one in British Columbia -- adding to six announced Sunday. All have links with travel to Mexico, where the illness is suspected of killing more than 150 people and of sickening more than 1,600.</p>
<p>Canadians who choose to maintain their travel plans to Mexico, despite a travel warning issued Monday by the Public Health Agency of Canada to delay trips if possible, will face questions about their health from customs officers upon their return. Border agents at airports have been directed to ask passengers if they have any of the swine flu symptoms -- fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, coughing, sore throat, vomiting and diarrhea -- or if they have been in contact with anyone who has symptoms.</p>
<p>If anyone answers "yes" they will be assessed further and possibly referred to a quarantine officer who may then advise travellers to go home and self-isolate or to go to a hospital.</p>
<p>"These measures will help to prevent further spread and protect the health of Canadians and we thank you for your patience and co-operation with this process," Dr. David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer, said here Tuesday at a news conference.</p>
<p>Airline passengers will also receive handouts with information about swine flu and will hear announcements on the plane.</p>
<p>But Canadians who were planning on travelling to Mexico soon are out of luck if they were booked on an <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> flight. The airline announced Tuesday that all flights to Mexico with <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> and its partner tour companies -- Transat Holidays and Nolitours -- have been cancelled until June 1. Customers will receive a credit for travel anywhere the airline flies that must be used before the end of October.</p>
<p>WestJet and WestJet Vacations announced Tuesday evening it will stop flying and vacation planning for Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan, and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, effective Monday, May 4, 2009.</p>
<p>Air Canada announced Tuesday evening that it will maintain its scheduled flights into Mexico City. But the airline also said customers with flights booked to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta between now and June 1 can rebook their holiday with no change fees.</p>
<p>Swine flu has now spread far beyond Mexico however, with more than 80 cases now confirmed in the United States, Canada, Spain, Scotland, Israel and New Zealand. There are also suspected cases in many more countries but laboratory tests have not yet confirmed whether they are cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>The United States now has at least 64 confirmed cases in five states. Ten cases are in California which declared a state of emergency Tuesday to tackle the outbreak.</p>
<p>The new Canadian cases reported Tuesday came as no surprise to health officials.</p>
<p>"Today's new cases were anticipated by the government and by public health officials and they do not change our course of action," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said at a news conference.</p>
<p>The first cases for Ontario include one man and three women in their 20s who live in the Toronto area. The Alberta cases involve men from Calgary and the northern part of the province, while the newest British Columbia case involves Victoria resident Michelle Bossi, 30.</p>
<p>Bossi, who got sick while in Mexico, wore a mask on her trip back to Victoria. But she's concerned she may have infected others after being told by health professionals in Victoria late Saturday she was not contagious.</p>
<p>"I'm annoyed I could have affected other people," said Bossi, who's recovering at home.</p>
<p>British Columbia now has a total of three swine flu cases and Nova Scotia has four. The cases in Canada are all considered mild.</p>
<p>The health minister said the federal government is following a six-point plan to deal with the swine flu outbreak, and is "on top of what is happening."</p>
<p>World health authorities are warning the swine flu outbreak could develop into a pandemic. Its spread around the globe and its person-to-person transmission prompted the World Health Organization on Monday afternoon to heighten its global pandemic alert system from level three to four.</p>
<p>WHO said the change is a signal that the world is a step closer to a pandemic but that one is not inevitable.</p>
<p>During a news briefing, WHO's assistant director-general of health security, Keiji Fukuda, said countries should anticipate what their needs will be if the outbreak becomes a pandemic, and that it will be a global responsibility to assist developing countries.</p>

</p>
<p>Fears of swine flu in Mexico are sending shock waves through the tourism industry as travel companies cautiously begin to pull the popular holiday destination from the itineraries of their planes and ships.</p>
<p>Reacting to the World Health Organization's decision to raise it's the level of the swine flu alert to Phase 4, several tour operators and airlines began yesterday to redirect passengers away from Mexican cities, cancelling flights and turning ships en route to Mexican harbours.</p>
<p>Air Canada and Air Canada Vacations will suspend all operations to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, until June 1. However, the airline said it will maintain its flights to Mexico City.</p>
<p>Air Canada Vacations customers booked for Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta may rebook their holiday with no change fees to any destination or resort offered by the company.</p>
<p>Montreal-based Transat AT, said it was bringing its customers and employees in Mexico back to Canada and postponing any further flights to the country until at least June 1.</p>
<p>"Transat is following the situation closely and could take additional measures depending on decisions that will be made by the public health authorities and governments concerned,'' the company said in a release.</p>
<p>"Similarly, the aforementioned measures could be changed as the situation evolves.''</p>
<p>Customers booked for future trips with <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, Transat Holidays, Nolitours, Vacances Transat and <span class="companylink">Look Voyages</span> scheduled to fly to Mexico between now and June 1 can change their travel plans with no additional charges.</p>
<p>It is also planning additional flights to other destinations to accommodate travellers.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Sunwing Vacations also put on hold all departures for Mexico until May 29, offering to rebook clients to other destinations or cancel their holiday and receive a credit for a future Sunwing holiday later this year.</p>
<p>Sunquest cancelled all of its tours to Mexico until June 4, offering customers the chance to change their bookings to any other Sunquest destination for travel up to Oct. 31.</p>
<p>In a similar move, Miami-based Carnival Cruise Lines suspended stops at Mexican ports for three ships scheduled to visit the country Tuesday, saying it hasn't yet announced a decision on future stops there.</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Mexican farm labourers face extra screening for swine flu but have not been barred from Ontario farms.</p>
<p>That's good news, because farmers depend on the imported labour, local apple farmer Steve Martin says.</p>
<p>"The impact would be absolutely horrific," said Martin, of Martin's Family Fruit Farm, north of Waterloo.</p>
<p>"If it's time to harvest, and you don't have the people there to harvest, you lose the crop."</p>
<p>Martin employs up to 95 seasonal workers at various sites and times. Most are from Trinidad but he also had a few Mexicans last year.</p>
<p>While he sees swine flu as a big concern, he sees no need at this time to bar skilled Mexican labourers who can't be easily replaced.</p>
<p>Challenges include government regulations and a shortage of farm labourers in other countries that supply them. "I think the government presently is taking a wise move," Martin said.</p>
<p>Ontario farms employed 8,500 Mexicans last year through a federal farm labour program. About 7,200 seasonal workers came from other Caribbean countries.</p>
<p>The workers must have physical examinations before arriving. Canada now says two physicians will also take temperatures in Mexico before labourers can leave for Canada.</p>
<p>Once here, seasonal workers can stay up to eight months, labouring in fields and greenhouses.</p>
<p>Farmers say they can't find Canadians to do the same jobs at an affordable cost. Barring cheaper Mexican labourers would cripple Ontario farms, they warn.</p>
<p>"We'd be done, it's as simple as that," said Ken Forth, who employs seasonal Jamaican labourers to farm broccoli near Hamilton. "These are the core workers. A lot of farms would be in serious trouble." Forth helps direct an agency that brings foreign farm workers here.</p>
<p>Ontario Federation of Agriculture president Bette Jean Crews employs two Mexicans who have been at her farm near Trenton for almost two weeks. She expects to employ a half-dozen more Mexicans for the apple harvest next fall.</p>
<p>"I think the government is doing the right thing," she said. "Everyone is checked before they get on the plane."</p>
<p>Crews is satisfied food safety is not being put at risk. "I think farmers are very much aware of food safety issues," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu hits Ontario; 13 cases in Canada as WHO considers raising alert level</b>
</div><div>Steve Rennie   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>857 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada has grown to 13 as health authorities in Alberta and Ontario reported their first outbreaks of the virus.</p>
<p>Seven new cases were reported yesterday: four in Ontario, two in Alberta, and one in British Columbia.</p>
<p>The new cases, like Canada's previous ones, are all linked to people who have been to Mexico, or travellers who have infected family and friends.</p>
<p>Canadian scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, which helped identify the new flu virus last week, are learning more about the Mexican bug. It appears to have an incubation period of between two and seven days.</p>
<p>There's also evidence it can spread to a so-called second and third generation, beyond the person initially infected, as the virus infects a second person who then gives it to a third person.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says it may raise the pandemic alert to Phase 5 on its six-point scale -- Phase 6 being a full pandemic -- if it finds evidence the swine flu virus can pass beyond second generation.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said while the new cases reported yesterday are all mild, the spread of the virus heightens the risk of a pandemic.</p>
<p>"While we are not in a pandemic, it simply means that the risk of one has increased,'' she told a news conference.</p>
<p>Canada's top medical officer, David Butler-Jones, said it's too soon to know how the virus will spread.</p>
<p>"Nature is always inventive, and it can go in either direction,'' he said.</p>
<p>"You can have severe presentation in Mexico . . . or it could be, as in 1918, where the first round was relatively mild and the next round was much more severe.''</p>
<p>He was referring to the Spanish flu pandemic that started in 1918, possibly the deadliest outbreak of all time, which killed an estimated 50 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Officials at Grand River Hospital are emphasizing preparedness over panic.</p>
<p>"In the short term, the important messages for the public are the same as any other time influenza is present in the community," chief executive officer Malcolm Maxwell said in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>If you're not feeling well, stay at home to rest and reduce the risk of infecting others. Seek medical care as you normally would. Be vigilant about washing your hands and covering up coughs and sneezes.</p>
<p>The hospital has established an operations committee to co-ordinate daily actions and hold teleconferences with St. Mary's General Hospital, although it has not had to implement its pandemic plan. Waterloo Region Public Health is giving daily updates from provincial and international authorities.</p>
<p>Incoming patients are being screened for symptoms, staff are being informed about proper isolation protocols and protective equipment should someone with symptoms turn up, and the hospital is stockpiling some equipment and drugs.</p>
<p>Visitors are not being screened yet, but are being asked not to come if they have symptoms of cold, flu or stomach virus.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said the government will continue with its six-point plan to deal with the threat, including: surveillance, international co-operation, research on vaccine development, stockpiles of antiviral medication, health services, and communications.</p>
<p>The minister said she has instructed customs officers to begin "enhanced screening'' of air travellers from Mexico.</p>
<p>In Ontario, the acting chief medical officer of health said all four cases there were considered mild and the individuals are recovering at their homes in the regions just outside Toronto.</p>
<p>"Personally, I know we're going to see a lot more cases. It's only a matter of time because of the amount of flow of public that go back and forth to Mexico,'' Dr. David Williams said. "It would not be surprising that we have some more confirmed cases.''</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer, Dr. Andre Corriveau, confirmed two mild cases of swine flu -- one in Calgary and the other in the northern part of the province.</p>
<p>Both individuals are male and contracted the influenza virus during recent travel to Mexico, Corriveau said. Neither man was treated in hospital. One no longer has symptoms, while the other has almost made a full recovery.</p>
<p>B.C. health authorities confirmed one more case yesterday, bringing the total in the province to three.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia had previously reported four cases.</p>
<p>On Monday, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to Phase 4 from Phase 3 to signal the increasing severity of the situation.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama administration not fully prepared to deal with swine flu</b>
</div><div>567 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>The following editorial appeared in the New York Times.</p>
<p>Is the new swine flu virus that has killed many people in Mexico and has spread to the United States and other countries the start of a much feared pandemic? Or is this yet another false alarm -- the latest in a long history of worrying that some day a hugely lethal flu strain might sweep through the world and kill tens of millions of people, much as it did in 1918-1919?</p>
<p>The answer at this point is that nobody knows for sure. There are some disquieting elements about the severity of the symptoms appearing in Mexico, offset by the apparently far milder behaviour of the virus in the United States. Experts clearly need to learn more about the origins, transmissibility and lethality of the new virus in coming weeks.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama hit the right note on Monday when he said there is reason for concern and for a heightened state of alert but no cause for alarm. Although the new strain of influenza is suspected of killing 149 people and sickening some 1,600 others in Mexico, the toll, so far, in the United States appears slight. There have been 40 confirmed swine flu cases. The illnesses have all been mild; only one patient was hospitalized and no one has died.</p>
<p>This situation does call for careful surveillance and preparations for the worst. American health officials have taken reasonable steps. They have made preparations to distribute up to a quarter of the anti-flu medicines from the government's strategic stockpile to states and localities should they be swamped with a wave of swine flu cases. They also have taken preliminary steps toward possible formulation of a vaccine to combat the new strain. Although it would take months to produce such a vaccine, it could be ready should another wave of swine flu emerge in the next influenza season.</p>
<p>Individuals who feel sick are advised to stay home so as not to infect others. They should cover their noses and mouths when sneezing. Healthy people are advised to avoid those who are sick, wash their hands often and thoroughly, and try to stay in good general health. Face masks are of unproven value.</p>
<p>Officials also have recommended that Americans forgo "nonessential travel" to Mexico while criticizing a similar warning from a European Union health official against travel to the United States. The American complaint is less self-serving than it might seem, given that the disease is more widespread and more severe in Mexico. The World Health Organization raised its alert level for the swine flu on Monday but recommended against closing borders or restricting international travel.</p>
<p>While health officials scramble to keep up with the fast-moving virus, it is deeply disquieting that the Obama administration has few of its top health officials in place. The Senate, delayed by Republican objections, is finally scheduled to debate the confirmation of Kathleen Sebelius on Tuesday to be secretary of health and human services. And the White House has yet to announce a nominee for director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>If the Obama administration is to be judged, as it should be, on how well it responds to this potential crisis, it would be best to have the full team in place.</p>

<p>The following is an edited excerpt from an editorial that appeared in yesterday's Toronto Star.</p>
<p>It is understandable that concerns are rising over the spread of deadly swine flu -- a virus suspected in illnesses around the world, including half a dozen confirmed cases in Canada. But health officials are surely right in advocating prudence rather than panic.</p>
<p>"We remain vigilant," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said yesterday. "While the risk to most Canadians remains low, we all need to practise basic flu prevention techniques (such as frequent handwashing) all the time."</p>
<p>Here in Toronto, epicentre of Canada's 2003 SARS outbreak, we certainly know the cost of failing to respond quickly and effectively to public health threats. The price was paid in lives (44 Canadians died in the SARS outbreak) and in the economy (as tourism slumped badly). But Canada is now better prepared to handle an infectious agent like the new H1N1 swine flu strain spreading outward from Mexico.</p>
<p>Since the SARS outbreak, hospitals have drafted pandemic plans and increased the number of isolation rooms and "negative pressure" rooms that are able to contain a virus. There's also better collaboration between various health agencies, more lab capacity, and stockpiles of antiviral drugs. All that should serve us well.</p>
<p>Still, our health-care network is far from perfect, and there is concern that budget pressures, including layoffs in some Ontario hospitals, have weakened its ability to handle an epidemic's surging demands.</p>

</p>
<p>An escalating viral outbreak with pandemic potential continued its slow paralysis of Mexico's once-bustling capital city yesterday as a growing number of swine flu cases in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere left the world bracing for the impact of a deepening global public-health crisis.</p>
<p>Nowhere were matters more urgent than in Mexico City, where swimming pools and pool halls were closed, restaurants offered only takeout and officials contemplated shutting the city's subway system, which ranks as the seventh-busiest in the world.</p>
<p>But the sense of alarm was mounting elsewhere as well as the number of confirmed cases in the U.S., including at least seven involving hospitalization, climbed to 68, up from 40 on Monday.</p>
<p>"I fully expect we will see deaths from this infection'' as cases are investigated, said Richard Besser, acting director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Canada confirmed seven more cases, bringing its total to 13 -- four in Nova Scotia, four in Ontario, three in B.C. and two in Alberta. All 13 cases were described as mild, but that offered little comfort to officials all too familiar with influenza's notoriously unpredictable nature.</p>
<p>"Anybody who thinks they know what this virus is going to do weeks, months or years from now really doesn't have a clue what they're talking about,'' said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>In New York, where the bulk of the American cases are concentrated, several hundred students had fallen ill at a school already hit by the outbreak after a group of students went on a spring break trip to Mexico, city officials said.</p>
<p>"It is here and it is spreading,'' New York City Health Commissioner Thomas Frieden said of the virus. "We do not know whether it will continue to spread.''</p>
<p>There were 17 confirmed cases outside North America: two in Scotland, 11 in New Zealand, two in Spain and two in Israel.</p>
<p>In Mexico, some 152 deaths have been attributed to the outbreak, which is confirmed or suspected in nearly 2,000 cases. So far, swine flu has not been blamed for deaths outside Mexico, but officials have warned that's almost certain to change.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress for $1.5 billion to fight the fast-spreading disease as federal officials suggested the flu may be spreading so fast, there may be no practical way to contain it.</p>
<p>"Based on the pattern of illness we're seeing, we don't think this virus can be contained,'' Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat, the Centers for Disease Control interim science and public health deputy director, told a Senate health subcommittee. "We do think we can reduce the impact of its spread, and reduce its impact on health.'' Still, she warned, not only might the disease get worse, "it might get much worse.''</p>
<p>In Mexico City, widely viewed as the epicentre of the outbreak, officials moved to prevent large gatherings -- public facilities like gyms, movie theatres, zoos and museums were ordered to shut. Schools remained closed across the country.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Home-care workers are beefing up precautions against swine flu as they visit clients throughout the region.</p>
<p>Red Cross workers arriving at residences, for example, will ask if clients have flu-like symptoms, spokesperson Tanya Elliott said yesterday.</p>
<p>"They do a screening when they arrive."</p>
<p>If a client is ill, the worker will take precautions such as donning a surgical mask and reporting the case promptly to health investigators.</p>
<p>"We're monitoring the situation closely," Elliott said.</p>
<p>Authorities are grappling with a widening swine-flu crisis, including yesterday's discovery of four mild, but uncomfortably close, cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>Dr. Nicola Mercer, the local medical health officer, said three cases are in Durham Region and one is in York.</p>
<p>This follows outbreaks in Mexico and a widening swath of the United States affecting hundreds of people.</p>
<p>Public health in Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph issued an alert to health-care workers on Monday, advising them to use "meticulous infection prevention and control."</p>
<p>Mercer noted this includes "appropriate use of personal protective equipment," such as masks, gloves and eye protection, along with good hand hygiene when in contact with patients, and the cleaning and disinfecting of equipment.</p>
<p>With her encouragement, hospitals are also advising visitors with flu-like symptoms to don masks, sanitize hands and inform front-line nurses immediately after coming to emergency wards.</p>
<p>Triage nurses at the Guelph General Hospital are now masked as a precaution.</p>
<p>Mercer said yesterday that her health board continues to monitor a few suspected cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>Samples were sent away Monday for lab testing, and it will take 48 hours to 10 days to get the results</p>
<p>"We continue to follow a number of individuals with symptoms," Mercer said.</p>
<p>Elliott said the precautions being taken by home-care workers were devised by the provincial Ministry of Health in the aftermath of the outbreak of SARS, the severe acute respiratory syndrome that struck the Toronto area and other parts of the world in the early years of this decade.</p>
<p>The ministry's appeal this week for precautionary measures such as masks and early reporting of patients with symptoms "has been reinforced with our workers," Elliott said.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Mercer advised Canadians planning vacations to get their flu shots before visiting Mexico, the country with the highest number of swine flu cases.</p>
<p>While it's unclear whether vaccines against the human strains of influenza can play a role in protecting against the swine flu versions now circulating, Mercer said yesterday that she still advises getting flu shots.</p>
<p>This is because the regular flu season, winter through spring, hasn't ended in that southern tourist mecca, she said.</p>
<p>"If you are insisting on travelling in Mexico, the seasonal flu is still circulating," Mercer said.</p>
<p>The conventional human flu virus circulates among people, while the new swine flu has migrated from pigs to humans and birds.</p>
<p>"The two diseases would look similar to physicians and feel similar to patients," Mercer said.</p>
<p>The swine flu outbreak has captured the attention of the public.</p>
<p>Well.ca, the online Canadian drugstore based in Guelph, is reporting a run on surgical masks and hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>"We are actually sold out of every single mask," Ali Asaria, the founder and chief executive, said yesterday. The company is also low on sanitizers.</p>
<p>He estimates sales of masks rose 2,000 per cent over the past three days.</p>
<p>Asaria's last 1,000 masks went out the door yesterday.</p>
<p>"We're getting customer calls all the time," Asaria said.</p>
<p>He has ordered more masks more from suppliers but isn't sure when they'll arrive.</p>
<p>"It's really hard to get anything right now."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Noveko boosted by swine flu concerns; Developer Of Germ-Killing Masks Up 450%In Month</b>
</div><div>John Greenwood   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>732 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Pandemics are bad for the economy, the stock market and business in general-- that is unless you're Andre Leroux, metals tycoon-turned-biotech entrepreneur.</p>
<p>Mr. Leroux's company, <span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>., is a developer of germ-killing medical masks and over the past few days its shares have skyrocketed, moving up more than 50% as swine flu fears spark speculation its products might be in high demand.</p>
<p>Over the past month Noveko shares have jumped 450%, boosting its market value to more than $200-million.</p>
<p>"Right now because of the Mexican situation, it's the mask that's the big feature for the time being, so we have to accelerate our marketing process," Mr. Leroux said in an interview.</p>
<p>The Montreal-based company also makes air-filter technology for buildings, recently striking a two-year distribution agreement with Aerosys Technologies of France, an aerospace-industry supplier.</p>
<p>Until now the story of Noveko has been mostly about a company struggling to get its product off the ground, but Mr. Leroux, the chief executive and biggest shareholder, figures victory is now in sight.</p>
<p>The powerful U. S. Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to approve Noveko's masks and if the result is positive-- as Mr. Leroux predicts it will be -- that would almost certainly spark a surge in sales. (The product has already been given the green light by Health Canada.)</p>
<p>Plenty of companies make masks that filter out germs but, according to Mr. Leroux, Noveko's are different because they are made with an anti-bacterial agent that also "neutralizes" the bugs that get trapped in the fibres. The company claims that even after extended use the masks continue to kill germs, unlike conventional products that merely trap microbes and end up contributing to the spread of disease.</p>
<p>But financial success is still a long way off.</p>
<p>Founded by Mr. Leroux about seven years ago, Noveko has yet to turn a significant profit. In the quarter ended Dec. 31, the company had a loss of $6.9-million, or 10¢ a share, compared with a loss of $3-million (6¢) in the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>At its current burn rate, the company has enough cash to last another 15 months, though Mr. Leroux hopes to break even before the end of 2009.</p>
<p>The biotech sector has faced an uphill battle in recent years, as players failed to follow through on their ambitious plans and ended up getting bought or simply going out of business.</p>
<p>"There's not a lot of viable companies left, really," said Cormark Securities analyst David Dean.</p>
<p>Still, biotech stocks often do well in times of health crises. In the first half of the decade, <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical</span> of Vancouver became a stock-market star after investors took a shine to its flu vaccine amid growing concern over bird flu. In 2005, <span class="companylink">ID Biomedical</span> was acquired by U. K. drugmaker <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span> for about $1.4-billion.</p>
<p>Whether Noveko proves to be part of a new wave of successful players is open to question, but Mr. Leroux is determined to see it happen.</p>
<p>A former chief executive of Leroux Steel, his family's steel company, he sat in the driver's seat from 1974 until 1999, by which time it was the third-biggest steel distributor in Canada. After selling his shares to his brother, Mr. Leroux formed Noveko, which at first operated in a variety of industries, including steel processing. About three years ago, Mr. Leroux moved into medical masks.</p>
<p>"I think the industry we are now in is a global industry and our market is the planet," he said. "Demand for biomedical products is huge."</p>

<p>Class amid crisis</p>
<p>The Canadian director of an upcoming Liam Neeson movie says Neeson showed remarkable professionalism in returning to work so soon after the death of wife Natasha Richardson. Atom Egoyan praised Neeson for returning to the Toronto set of Chloe the week after Richardson's death. Neeson came back for a couple days' work to complete his scenes for the thriller directed by Egoyan.</p>
<p>"He was very committed to the film and finishing his role, and he didn't need to come back that soon," Egoyan said in an interview for his new drama Adoration, which opens May 8. "But he really thought it would be best for the film, and it was just such an unspeakably generous thing for him to do. And he's an extraordinary, extraordinary person."</p>

<p>A source said: "Victoria really felt that 35 was a turning point. Since moving to Los Angeles in 2007, she been surrounded by young Hollywood stars and she wants to keep up with them."</p>
<p>FLU FEARS SIDELINE Wolverine</p>
<p>Even the mighty Wolverine is taking precautions when it comes to swine flu. Film distributor 20th Century Fox says it has cancelled actor Hugh Jackman's scheduled appearance in Mexico City to promote X-Men Origins: Wolverine.</p>
<p>The U.S. and several other countries have warned citizens to avoid nonessential travel to Mexico, where the number of deaths blamed on the new virus has surpassed 150. Meanwhile, movie theatres in Mexico City are closed to prevent the flu from spreading.</p>
<p>20th Century Fox representative Christina Inman says a Mexico première at the National Auditorium and media events today have been cancelled until further notice.</p>

<p>Pete Doherty has sparked speculation he has swine flu, after being pictured with Britain's first sufferer. A photo of the Babyshambles front man with Dawn Askham -- who is believed to have contracted the potentially life-threatening virus along with her husband, Iain, while on their honeymoon in Mexico -- has emerged showing Dawn with her arms wrapped around the rocker. Dawn and Iain, from Scotland, returned from their holiday on April 21 and were transferred to an isolation ward in hospital on Saturday. A source said: "Pete's friends are worried he may have the deadly illness. He has got himself clean of drugs, the last thing he needs is this." It is not known when the photo of Pete and Dawn was taken.</p>
<p>Goodness gracious, now he's a road</p>
<p>Jerry Lee Lewis, the piano-pounding rock 'n' roller known as The Killer, has been honoured by Tennessee legislators who voted to name a stretch of road after him.</p>
<p>A proposal unanimously approved Monday evening by the House designates a stretch of Getwell Road in Shelby County as the Jerry Lee Lewis Highway.</p>
<p>The section runs from the Mississippi state line to Interstate 240.</p>
<p>Lewis, well-known for his hit Great Balls of Fire, said "it's not every day you get a street named after you -- it's a great honour."</p>
<p>A companion bill unanimously passed the Senate earlier this month and now goes to Governor Phil Bredesen for his consideration. Sun Records, the label credited with discovering Lewis back in the 1950s, is based in Memphis.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pigs can incubate viruses, says flu expert</b>
</div><div>Steve Connor   </div>
<div>The Independent, London</div>
<div>332 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A09</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>One of Britain's leading flu experts has urged the Mexican authorities to investigate the level to which the country's pig population is infected with the H1N1 strain of influenza virus responsible for the human outbreak.</p>
<p>An analysis of the H1N1 virus present in humans has found that it contains viral genes shared with swine flu, but as yet there has been no confirmed cases of the virus in pig herds in Mexico, said Professor Alan Hay of the MRC National Institute for Medical Research.</p>
<p>Pigs are known to be able to incubate both human and avian flu viruses, as well as swine flu, and this multiple infection in one animal can lead to "triple reassortment" whereby a completely novel influenza virus emerges that can then sweep through the human population as pandemic flu, Hay said.</p>
<p>Now that the H1N1 virus has spread within the human population it can evolve into forms that can be more easily transmitted between people, as well as into forms that become more dangerous over time.</p>
<p>"Many of the infections, particularly in the United States and elsewhere have not been due to exposure to pigs and many of the infections in Mexico have not been associated with contact with pigs, it is quickly clearly spreading in the human population," Hay said.</p>
<p>Scientists fear that as the H1N1 strain of the virus circulates within the human population it could undergo further mutations that could make it more virulent, and deadly, over time. This could lead to second or third flu waves that cause high death rates.</p>
<p>Angus Nichol, head of the Influenza Programme at the European Centre for Disease Control in Stockholm, said: "Influenza viruses are very slippery creatures. You don't know how they are going to behave and their behaviour can change over time.</p>

<p>PETERBOROUGH</p>
<p>Surrounded by family and friends, Dylan Pazzano stood in front of the Peterborough Regional Health Centre yesterday, speaking about his wife Victoria, unconscious and on life support in the hospital's intensive care unit.</p>
<p>"I'm going to lose my wife. The people behind me are all going to lose somebody so special. But we finally achieved what we wanted, to get her back home... ."</p>
<p>Victoria George-Pazzano, a 29-year-old market researcher from Toronto, suffered a severe asthma attack while vacationing in Cancun with her husband and five-year-old son Isaac last Tuesday.</p>
<p>Since then, it has been a battle for Pazzano to bring his wife home and into a Canadian hospital.</p>
<p>He believes the recent fear over the swine flu in Mexico delayed her trip back.</p>
<p>His dying wife arrived in Toronto by air ambulance early yesterday morning and was taken to the Peterborough hospital, where doctors are conducting a full assessment.</p>
<p>While in Mexico, Pazzano said he dealt with the Canadian Consulate, which did everything it could from its end.</p>
<p>He can't speak highly enough about the care the doctors and nurses in Cancun gave his wife.</p>
<p>"I understand that. What I can't accept is what is happened to us up here."</p>
<p>An Ontario ministry spokesperson had stated earlier that no orders were issued restricting admission of people from Mexico into Ontario's hospitals.</p>
<p>Federal officials had also said they had been working with Mexican organizations to bring her back to Canada.</p>

<p>Michael Gligic will play in a professional golf tournament this week where spectators and even caddies are banned, where medical personnel will be standing by and some of his fellow competitors may even be wearing masks.</p>
<p>This wasn't the way Gligic had imagined his career on the Canadian Professional Golf Tour would begin.</p>
<p>The 19-year-old from Burlington, one of the youngest players on the Canadian Tour, is in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a city that is believed to be one of the hotspots of the swine flu outbreak. He's there for the second of the Canadian Tour's four events in Mexico.</p>
<p>Some reports have the confirmed cases of swine flu in San Louis Potosi to be as high as two dozen.</p>
<p>Gligic, who played in last week's event in Mazatlan, said he seriously considered pulling out of this week's event to fly home. He had even gone as far as removing his luggage from the bus that was taking the players to the tournament site. He changed his mind, however, and decided to go to San Luis Potosi.</p>
<p>"I talked to my dad the next morning and he'd calmed down a little bit and we came to an agreement that I'd come here and if it was really that bad, I would just fly home from here," said Gligic, who admits that the lack of concrete information the players have been able to get is a little unsettling.</p>
<p>"For the most part, it seems fine and I'm just going from the hotel to the golf course."</p>
<p>The Canadian Tour is taking extraordinary measures to protect the players by banning spectators and caddies.</p>
<p>"The golf course is basically a fortress," said Canadian Tour commissioner Rick Janes. "We're monitoring this situation minute to minute."</p>
<p>Janes said the Canadian Tour, which is based in Oakville, will have an emergency evacuation plan in place by today to get everyone out if they have to. He said they are also prepared to cancel the Tour's other two events in Merida Yucatan and Riviera Maya if the situation gets worse. They were scheduled to meet with the players last night to update them on the situation.</p>
<p>"Pretty much everyone here is starting to wear masks and even some of the guys on Tour are starting to wear them," Gligic said. "I bought one when I went to the grocery store the day I arrived here.</p>
<p>"Everything here is closed, restaurants, schools, universities, churches, but I don't really want to go walking the streets anyway."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu could be pandemic; Global health crisis looms as numbers rise</b>
</div><div>James Mccarten   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>777 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>An escalating viral outbreak with pandemic potential continued its slow paralysis of Mexico's once-bustling capital city yesterday as a growing number of swine flu cases in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere left the world bracing for the impact of a deepening global public-health crisis.</p>
<p>Nowhere were matters more urgent than in Mexico City, where swimming pools and pool halls were closed, restaurants offered only takeout and officials contemplated severing the city's spinal column: a serpentine subway system that ranks as the seventh-busiest in the world.</p>
<p>But the sense of alarm was mounting elsewhere as well as the number of confirmed cases in the U.S., including at least five involving hospitalization, climbed to 68, up from 40 on Monday.</p>
<p>"I fully expect we will see deaths from this infection" as cases are investigated, said Richard Besser, acting director of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Canada confirmed seven more cases, bringing its total to 13.</p>
<p>"Anybody who thinks they know what this virus is going to do weeks, months or years from now really doesn't have a clue what they're talking about," said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>In New York, where the bulk of the American cases are concentrated, several hundred students had fallen ill at a school already hit by the outbreak after a group of students went on a spring break trip to Mexico, city officials said.</p>
<p>"It is here and it is spreading," New York City Health Commissioner Thomas Frieden said of the virus. "We do not know whether it will continue to spread."</p>
<p>Outside of North America, there were 17 other confirmed cases: two in Scotland, 11 in New Zealand, two in Spain and two in Israel.</p>
<p>In Mexico, some 152 deaths have been attributed to the outbreak, which is confirmed or suspected in nearly 2,000 cases of illness. So far, swine flu has not been blamed for any deaths outside Mexico, but officials have warned that's almost certain to change.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization, which on Monday ratcheted up its pandemic alert level from Phase 3 to Phase 4, was looking for evidence the virus was spreading in sustained waves before moving to Phase 5, said the agency's top influenza expert, Dr. Keiji Fukuda.</p>
<p>The WHO and its panel of expert advisers want to see that the swine flu virus has actually taken root in countries other than Mexico and are continuing to transmit, said Fukuda, the WHO's acting assistant director-general for health security and environment.</p>
<p>"What we are looking for also are cases in outbreak which indicate that the infection is becoming established in a community or becoming established in a country," Fukuda said.</p>
<p>The global health body insisted that travel restrictions were ineffective.</p>
<p>"Border controls do not work. Travel restrictions do not work," WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl said, recalling the 2003 SARS epidemic that killed 774 people and slowed the global economy.</p>
<p>"There was much more economic disruption caused by these measures than there was public health benefit," he said, adding that WHO is advising countries to provide treatment for the sick and make sure national plans are in place to ease the effects of a larger outbreak.</p>
<p>Flu deaths are nothing new in the United States or elsewhere. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that about 36,000 people died of flu-related causes each year, on average, during the 1990s in the United States.</p>
<p>But the new flu strain is a combination of pig, bird and human viruses that humans may have no natural immunity to.</p>
<p>A decision by WHO to put an alert at Phases 4 or 5 signals that the virus is becoming increasingly adept at spreading among humans. Phase 6 is for a full-blown pandemic, characterized by outbreaks in at least two regions of the world.</p>
<p>Symptoms include a fever of more than 38C, coughing, joint aches, severe headache and, in some cases, vomiting and diarrhea. Many victims have been in their 30s and 40s -- not the very old or young who typically succumb to the flu.</p>
<p>It could take four to six months before the first batch of vaccines are available, WHO said.</p>

</p>
<p>Ontario confirmed its first four cases of swine flu yesterday, as officials warned against misinformation about the new flu strain circulating on Twitter and the web.</p>
<p>The Canadian tally for A/H1N1 influenza, which originated in Mexico, stood at 13 cases yesterday, including three in Ontario's Durham Region and one in York.</p>
<p>The Canadian cases are mild, and involve only patients who had been in Mexico, providing no reason yet for anyone to over-react, said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer. He acknowledged there will be more cases, but said the public should avoid blogs and other sites where unreliable posters are speculating about the flu.</p>
<p>"We have lots of scenariologists, I'm going to call them ... and those are only people's opinions on how they might think things are going."</p>
<p>But a full scale pandemic remained an unnerving possibility, with dozens of cases under investigation in Canada alone. Three of those were in Hamilton, the city's public health department said.</p>
<p>Scientists are only in the initial stages of assessing the full threat.</p>
<p>"Anybody who thinks they know what this virus is going to do weeks, months or years from now really doesn't have a clue what they're talking about," said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>In New York, several hundred children are now ill at a school hit by swine flu after some students returned from a Mexican trip.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed American cases rose to 68 as President Barack Obama asked Congress for $1.5 billion US to fight the flu. California declared a state of health emergency that would trigger aid.</p>
<p>The rate of flu infection dropped slightly in Mexico City, epicentre of the outbreak, where public facilities such as theatres and restaurants have shut. The flu has caused an estimated 150 deaths and infected 2,000 in Mexico.</p>
<p>Advisories from Canada and other countries to skip non-essential travel to Mexico prompted Montreal-based Transat to bring customers and employees home.</p>
<p>Transat is postponing any further trips to Mexico until June.</p>
<p>The Carnival cruise line also cancelled Mexican stops and Cuba became the first country to suspend flights to and from Mexico temporarily as a precaution .</p>
<p>Dozens of events were cancelled, including actor Hugh Jackman's appearance in Mexico City to promote a movie. The delivery of bid books by candidates for the 2015 Pan Am Games was also delayed.</p>
<p>American health officials suggested there may be no practical way to stop spread of the flu.</p>
<p>"Based on the pattern of illness we're seeing, we don't think this virus can be contained," Rear Admiral Anne Schuchat of the Centers for Disease Control told a U.S. Senate committee. "We do think we can reduce the impact of its spread, and reduce its impact on health."</p>
<p>In Canada, the head of Ontario's Health Protection and Promotion Agency said "there is already evidence this virus is mutating pretty rapidly, as influenza does."</p>
<p>Vivek Goel, agency CEO, said it is too early to tell precisely where the strain is going, but there is still no evidence of the widespread person-to-person transmission that would constitute a pandemic.</p>
<p>Goel stressed the need for calm while scientists do their work.</p>
<p>"News of the flu is moving faster than the flu is," he said. "The comment about Twitter and the blogosphere is really important."</p>
<p>Inaccurate buzz about the flu on microblogging sites prompted the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta to start using Twitter to counter-balance the errors.</p>
<p>Across Canada, seven new cases were reported yesterday for the total of 13 -- the four in Ontario, two in Alberta and one in B.C.</p>

<p>Get serious</p>
<p>In the last two days, I have come across at least five articles or op-eds reflecting upon Susan Boyle in this newspaper, to say nothing of the saturation of her story across every other form of media in the past week. I cannot recall the last time I saw a headline containing the words Tamil or Darfur in the Free Press. There are more important things happening in the world. Can we please move on?</p>
<p>Devin Morrow</p>
<p>Winnipeg</p>
<p>Source of disease</p>
<p>I find it incredible that neither the Free Press nor the television news dig a little deeper about the swine flu and link it to intensive livestock operations. The caging of hundreds and thousands of pigs is becoming incompatible with our survival on this planet. They overuse antibiotics, they don't manage the manure properly, and they damage our water systems. The swine flu is one indication that we have to rethink the way we treat livestock and produce meat.</p>

<p>Convert to green</p>
<p>The talking heads on Broadway, in their rush to appear green, have wasted thousands of taxpayer dollars and created an environmental monster.</p>
<p>There are now thousands of pounds of unwanted and unusable porcelain with nowhere to go.</p>
<p>It is too bad that someone didn't Google "dual flush conversion kits." I did and found several manufacturers of them. Some were Canadian.</p>
<p>With all of the engineering resources at their disposal, the provincial government could have investigated and tested some of these kits and determined if they were, in fact, a feasible alternative to the wholesale replacement of toilets</p>

<p>Put up a patio</p>
<p>Re: David Square's letter Stop the speakeasy (April 25). To refer to Pizzeria Gusto as a pizza joint points out all too clearly that he has never been there to experience the first-class menu, the knowledgeable, courteous staff, the attractive decor as well as the classy ambiance.</p>
<p>A restaurant that has been named one of the top 10 new restaurants in Canada, as well as the number one new restaurant in Winnipeg, does not become a dirty, noisy speakeasy because of the addition of a patio.</p>
<p>The patio will enhance the whole area. Imagine being able to walk to such a restaurant with great food and enjoy a glass of wine, sitting under the stars, savouring the few days of summer that we have.</p>

<p>Weather the culprit</p>
<p>Re: Hubert (Jack) Jonasson's letter Little faith in engineers (April 24). He disagrees with the considerable hydraulic analysis that has been undertaken regarding ice jamming. The reality is that this spring's major flood challenge was ice jamming that resulted in flooding south of the floodway, within Winnipeg, and north of the floodway. The floodway was not the cause of ice jamming -- ice jamming was caused by unprecedented weather conditions, including high water levels and unusual ice conditions.</p>
<p>During the Clean Environment Commission hearing on floodway expansion, the CEC heard from the coalition's expert as well as the MFA's expert. The CEC brought in a third-party expert who agreed with the MFA position that ice jamming is the result of weather conditions, along with the geographic characteristics of the river.The CEC recognized that the floodway does not create water but simply diverts a portion of the Red's flow around Winnipeg. By diverting the flow, the floodway did its job and kept water levels about nine feet lower within Winnipeg.</p>

<p>Correcting Walker</p>
<p>Just a couple of corrections to Morley Walker's review (Milton for Dummies this isn't, April 25) of Paradise Lost: The poem is not free verse but blank verse, and the lyrics to the song were written by that veritable Milton Grant Guy, not Sharon Bajer, though doubtless a veritable Milton herself. As for his musings that "Better to reign in Hell" etc. may have been directed at Klassen, I won't spoil Walker's fun (veiled gossip?) by disabusing him of the notion. Gave me a good laugh, anyway.</p>

<p>Incomparable Cohen</p>
<p>Re: Battle of the bards (April 25). When I found Leonard Cohen, I think I found a poet for the ages. I am fairly certain that he will rank up there with the big poets (and songwriters) of all time. A quote in the article suggested that this would not be the case. I think Gordon Lightfoot is a Canadian "icon" for my generation and maybe generations to come, but I don't think it is fair to compare him to a giant like Cohen.</p>

<p>Re: Cruise ship turns table on Somali pirates, returns fire, April 27. A while ago, I wrote that pirates can be defeated by putting armed personnel, military or civilian, with water cannon and firearms, on merchant ships, to "ride shotgun" and "repel boarders." Now it appears that the owners of the Italian cruise ship Melody have done that, with success, namely private Israeli security forces. Who knew that they get the Free Press in Genoa?</p>

<p>WHAT ARE WE LOOKING FOR?</p>
<p>Between the credit crisis, global recession and now a swine flu outbreak, these are risky times for investors. What better way to ride out the turmoil than with blue-chip stocks that pay rising dividends?</p>
<p>Dividend growth stocks are attractive for a few reasons. They put a growing stream of cash in your pocket. The income is taxed at a favourable rate, thanks to the dividend tax credit. And studies have shown that, over long periods, stocks with rising dividends beat those with flat or no dividends.</p>
<p>That makes dividend stocks an excellent choice for investors, including retirees, BMO Nesbitt Burns' chief economist Sherry Cooper says in her latest book, The New Retirement: How It Will Change Our Future.</p>
<p>“The most favourable are those stocks with an attractive yield, a history of steady dividend growth above the rate of inflation, a low payout ratio and an improving position in the marketplace,” she writes.</p>
<p>TODAY'S SCREEN</p>
<p>We'll update a stock screen that Ms. Cooper presents in her book. To make the cut, the company had to have a dividend yield of more than 2.5 per cent and a five-year dividend growth rate of more than 10 per cent. To emphasize dividend safety, the payout ratio – dividends divided by earnings – had to be less than 60 per cent. And because we want stocks that are less risky, the beta – a measure of a stock's volatility in relation to the market – had to be less than 1.</p>
<p>WHAT DID WE FIND?</p>
<p>Reflecting the sinking economy, the list has shrunk from 12 companies when we last ran the screen in February to just seven today. Most are making a return appearance, but there are a couple of new names on the list – <span class="companylink">Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd</span>., which made a bundle betting against U.S. subprime mortgages, and specialty TV and radio operator <span class="companylink">Corus Entertainment Inc</span>.</p>
<p>Tomorrow we'll look at U.S. dividend growth stocks.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Shamed by SARS, China vows transparency; Though it has yet to confirm a single case, Beijing swings into action against swine flu in a dramatic contrast to 2003's policy of denial</b>
</div><div>MARK MacKINNON   </div>
<div>794 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>BEIJING -- There has not yet been a single confirmed case of swine flu in China, but an epidemic of official anxiety over the virus has already struck this country, with the government taking pains to show that it has learned from its bungled handling of the SARS outbreak in 2003.</p>
<p>“Precaution” was the one-word headline in the official China Daily newspaper yesterday, running amid a series of photographs of people around the world wearing face masks to guard against the spread of the killer swine flu. President Hu Jintao ordered the government to step up efforts to keep the virus from entering China and to control any possible outbreak to “ensure the people's health and safety,” state television reported. Premier Wen Jiabao weighed in as well, and government officials of every level were tripping over themselves yesterday to declare how swiftly and transparently they would report on any swine flu outbreak in this country of 1.3 billion people.</p>
<p>A school was closed Sunday in the northwestern province of Shaanxi and students were examined after several displayed flu-like symptoms that were reportedly later determined to have been caused by relatively common Type-B influenza. Several other suspected cases were being examined, although none were described by the World Health Organization as likely to be the H1N1 strain of swine flu that has killed scores in Mexico and rapidly spread to Canada, the United States and several other countries. South Korea and Thailand were among the countries investigating probable cases of swine flu yesterday.</p>
<p>Hans Troedsson, the WHO's representative in China, said the reporting of suspected cases in Shaanxi and elsewhere suggested that the government is well prepared for the potential spread of the virus. “If you don't have any suspected cases, I would say that your surveillance system might not work that well. So, it's actually a good indication that they have a surveillance system that works,” he said after meeting with representatives from the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>Though bigger tests are likely to lie ahead, the government's willingness to report even suspected cases of swine flu already stands in stark contrast to 2003, when Chinese officials were accused of abetting the spread of SARS, or severe acute respiratory syndrome, by initially denying its existence and then underreporting the scope of what was happening. SARS eventually killed 650 people in China and the handling of the epidemic sparked rare public displays of anger at the government.</p>
<p>Shamed and smartened, Beijing is vowing to be a model of transparency this time around. The policy-making State Council declared fighting the spread of the swine flu virus its “central task” and ordered a host of measures be put into place, including the creation of a “direct reporting system on the epidemic leading to early discovery, early reports, early diagnosis, early quarantine and early treatment.”</p>
<p>“As soon as cases are discovered in our borders they must be publicly announced in a timely manner,” a statement released by the State Council said. The government also banned pork imports from Mexico and the U.S. states of Texas, Kansas and California.</p>
<p>Because of its mammoth population and densely packed cities – not to mention the 450 million pigs raised here, half the global total – China is seen as being at high risk as the virus spreads and any outbreak of swine flu could have devastating effects here.</p>
<p>However, the SARS experience should help China cope if swine flu does cross its borders. Temperature screening machines have been in use at many Chinese airports since the epidemic. The special autonomous region of Hong Kong – which was hit hardest by SARS, with 1,755 infections and 299 deaths in 2003 – is among the best-prepared cities anywhere, with 1,400 beds available in respiratory isolation units as a result of SARS and a stockpile of some 20 million treatment courses of Tamiflu, a medicine to which the swine flu has yet to develop resistance, for its population of seven million people.</p>
<p>Even the official press has made clear that the public expects better from its leaders this time around. “China must remember the lessons it learned from the SARS experience: that transparency of information is essential for combatting the spread of an infectious outbreak,” read yesterday's editorial in the Global Times, a mouthpiece of the Communist Party. “The more information the public is provided with, the better equipped we will be as a country and as a society to decrease its potential impact.”</p>

<p>The Canadian Tour is cutting short its swing through Mexico because of the country's swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The developmental circuit said late yesterday it's postponing the Yucatan Country Club Classic and Iberostar Riviera Maya Open in May as a “precaution.”</p>
<p>The Yucatan was to begin May 7, the Iberostar the following Thursday. They were to be the third and final stop, respectively, of the tour's annual trek through Mexico.</p>
<p>The second tournament, the San Luis Potosi Open, is still on and is to begin tomorrow. However, between 10 and 15 golfers have already withdrawn amid the country's growing health crisis.</p>

<p>Officials of this weekend's Canada Cup diving tournament in Montreal are breaking out the hand sanitizers, keeping a doctor on standby and cautioning athletes on methods of disease prevention after the swine flu outbreak created havoc at the diving World Series event last week in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Divers competed in front of empty stands and fans were banned by health authorities from attending the Mexican event because of concerns about contagion. Organizers lost as much as $600,000, said Mitch Geller, chief technical officer for Diving Canada.</p>
<p>“It was an aggressive move to go that far,” Mr. Geller said. “I'm not aware of it ever being done. It was a strange circumstance. … It obviously can affect the competition and it makes the money invested by the Mexican federation and the city a total writeoff. You have to fly in judges, supply prize money …”</p>
<p>There will be 67 divers from 14 nations competing at Montreal Olympic Sport Park, tomorrow through Sunday. Some of them – Canadians, Australians and Mexicans – competed last week, but none of the athletes have displayed any flu symptoms, Mr. Geller said. If any do, they can be isolated from the others in a private room, said Patrick Godbout, director of media relations for Diving Canada.</p>
<p>Canada Cup officials are taking precautions “but not treating it as a problem. We're making sure everyone knows the basics of being careful. We're not shutting down. We welcome people to come,” Mr. Godbout said.</p>
<p>Australia's Olympic gold medal diver Matthew Mitcham and silver medal-winning teammates Melissa Wu and Bree Cole retreated to their hotel rooms following the World Series final in Mexico City and waited for their flight to Canada.</p>
<p>“They kicked people out of the competition there, they just shut it down to the public. It was a little bit bizarre competing in that situation,” Mr. Mitcham told The Australian newspaper. “There were masks available at the reception desk of our hotel [in Mexico] and we wore them whenever we went out in public.”</p>

<p>Will wearing a mask protect me against swine flu?</p>
<p>A mask can, theoretically, limit the spread of the virus by an infected person and limit exposure to the virus among non-infected individuals. But at this point there is no evidence of community spread of swine flu in Canada, so unless you're living with a person with swine flu, a mask is unnecessary. Should swine flu gain a foothold in Canada, however, public officials will likely recommend use of masks (or respirators as they are known officially). If that happens, the key is to get a mask that fits and filters well. An N-95 mask that fits snuggly to the mouth and nose is the ideal. A surgical mask is largely useless.</p>
<p>How is swine flu treated?</p>
<p>The symptoms of swine flu are similar to those of seasonal influenza and the treatment is the same: Drink plenty of liquids and get lots of rest. Some patients are treated with oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza). In severe influenza cases, where the virus overwhelms the lungs, patients are admitted to hospital where they receive antibiotics to prevent secondary infections, intravenous fluids to avoid dehydration, and breathing support, including oxygen and sometimes a ventilator.</p>
<p>Isn't the flu a winter disease? I thought the virus didn't spread in warm weather.</p>
<p>Influenza is much more common in the winter months, in large part because people spend more time indoors in confined spaces. The flu virus also spreads less easily when it is humid. However, there are exceptions. The Spanish flu, the most deadly pandemic in history, like the swine flu, first appeared in Canada in the spring of 1918 and became increasingly deadly in the summer and fall.</p>
<p>Why do I keep hearing public health officials say that “it's going to get worse before it gets better”? Is a pandemic inevitable?</p>
<p>Infectious diseases tend to spread in a fairly predictable manner – the number of infected individuals rises steadily to an epidemic peak and then new infections gradually decline. The steady reporting of new cases of swine flu suggests that the curve is still rising. The great unknown is when the peak will be reached – it could be a few thousand infections or hundreds of millions. Swine flu could peter out quickly (like SARS), spread with increasing ferocity for months (like Spanish flu), or flare up unpredictably (like the bird flu). Keiji Fukuda of the World Health Organization summed up the view of public health officials yesterday when he said: “Evolution toward a pandemic cannot be considered inevitable but countries should take this opportunity to prepare themselves for the possibility of a pandemic.”</p>
<p>What is the incubation period for swine flu? It seems to me this is important, with thousands of migrant workers heading to Canada.</p>
<p>The incubation period for influenza is brief, 24 to 48 hours. Practically, that means people with swine flu can infect others only one or two days before their own symptoms arise. People with the flu are also infectious and can continue to be for up to a week after becoming sick. Canadian public health officials have been dispatched to Mexico to conduct screening of migrant workers before they come to Canada.</p>

<div>THE SWINE FLU: ANALYSIS: MEDIA RESPONSIBILITY</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Keep fear-o-meter on low for now</b>
</div><div>ANDRÉ PICARD   </div>
<div>955 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>It has been just more than six years since the advent of severe acute respiratory syndrome, an outbreak whose trajectory is eerily similar to Mexican swine flu.</p>
<p>Swine flu stories have come to dominate the news, just as in the early days of SARS. Politicians and public-health officials have done non-stop briefings. Mexico City looks strangely like Toronto circa spring 2003, a city of mask-wearing residents living in fear.</p>
<p>But should we be more alarmed by the pandemic potential of swine flu than we were by SARS?</p>
<p>Almost all of the cases of swine flu we have seen in Canada are in travellers returning from Mexico. The virus is spreading human-to-human, which is worrisome, but there is no evidence of this occurring on a sustained or widespread basis outside of Mexico.</p>
<p>Unless the swine flu virus begins spreading in the community – in schools, shopping malls, etc. – we should keep the fear-o-meter on low. (That's exactly what level 4 of the WHO pandemic alert scale represents. We are a long way from level 6, a pandemic.)</p>
<p>There are valuable lessons to be learned from the SARS outbreak that can help us keep the threat of swine flu in perspective.</p>
<p>Yet, the media seems to have lost sight of one of the key lessons of SARS: Beware the numbers game.</p>
<p>During SARS, journalists tracked the number of cases, suspected and confirmed – not to mention the body count – obsessively.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the swine flu numbers game kicked into high gear, with hour-by-hour updates. This is misleading and unhelpful, neglecting the basic science of epidemics: Infections rise according to a predictable pattern, following an increasingly rapid curve until they hit a peak, then tail off. This is precisely what is happening with swine flu. There is no question that in the days – and likely weeks – to come, the number of confirmed infections and deaths will increase. This is not, in itself, a cause for panic. It is entirely predictable.</p>
<p>SARS was essentially a hospital-acquired infection. Virtually everyone who contracted the disease, after a traveller brought the pathogen from Hong Kong to Toronto, did so in a hospital, or was infected by a close relative who worked or was treated in a health-care facility.</p>
<p>There was never a threat in the general community. And, in the end, there were only 44 SARS deaths in Canada. (This is not to minimize these deaths, but to provide context: There are about 12,000 deaths annually in the country caused by other hospital-acquired infections.)</p>
<p>To reiterate, swine flu remains a travel-related infection that has affected relatively few people.</p>
<p>So far, the outbreak of swine flu news coverage has been far more severe than the outbreak of the disease itself. The good news is that there are stark differences in the response of politicians and public-health officials to swine flu, compared with SARS.</p>
<p>When SARS came along in 2003, Canada's public-health infrastructure was in disarray, relations between provincial and federal health officials were poisonous, and Canada spent more time bickering with the World Health Organization than working in tandem. This time, there is a co-ordinated response and it is led by people with expertise in infectious disease.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public-health officer – a position created in direct response to the SARS debacle – and his provincial and territorial counterparts are singing from the same hymn book. Similarly, the response of politicians has been impressive. Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq has shown quiet leadership, demonstrating enough smarts to defer to public-health experts.</p>
<p>The change has been even more spectacular in Ontario. The final report of the SARS inquiry described Ontario's public-health system as “broken, neglected, inadequate and dysfunctional,” but today the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion is not only functional, but on the leading edge. The agency sent out an alert about a worrisome disease outbreak in Mexico on April 21, before the swine flu was identified as a new pathogen. It is hard to imagine how it could have done more.</p>
<p>Public-health officials have communicated well, delivering the message that we need to be concerned about the possibility of a pandemic flu, but not alarmed by what has occurred. The message has, unfortunately, sometimes been lost in the media frenzy.</p>
<p>Candace Gibson, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Western Ontario, noted there is an unofficial rule in medical literature (where multi-author papers are common) that there should never be more authors than subjects.</p>
<p>Similarly, Prof. Gibson says, there should never be more stories about a health threat than actual sick people.</p>
<p>With swine flu, hopefully, that balance will be achieved not with more death, but with a little more restraint.</p>

<p>Pork producers and hog farmers around the world say they are being sideswiped by the swine flu outbreak and many want the name of the disease changed to “North American flu.”</p>
<p>Yesterday, roughly a dozen countries joined Russia and China in banning imports of pork products from parts of the United States, Mexico and elsewhere. South Korea and Ukraine have banned all pork and live hogs from North America and Indonesia is destroying products already brought in.</p>
<p>While Canada has been spared the brunt of the trade action, many hog farmers here are worried consumers will stop eating pork. Canada exports about one million tonnes of pork products annually, mainly to the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>A variety of organizations, including the Canadian Pork Council, American Meat Institute and World Organization for Animal Health, have called on health officials to drop the “swine flu” name. They say the pork industry is being unfairly linked to the illness.</p>
<p>“There are serious misunderstandings which the general public in countries around the world have acquired about the role of pork meat in the transfer of the virus, simply because it is being referred to as swine flu,” Canadian Pork Council President Jurgen Preugschas said in a letter yesterday to federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said yesterday that it plans to stick with “swine flu.” But U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said he is considering using another name.</p>

<p>With cancellations of flights to Mexico piling up, a handful of Canadians recovering in quarantine and California declaring a state of emergency, the fervent efforts to trace the origin of the fatal swine flu have come to rest, if only momentarily, on the shoulders of a five-year-old boy.</p>
<p>Edgar Hernandez, wide-eyed with a cheeky grin, looks today like any other kindergartener in the Mexican town of La Gloria, in Veracruz state.</p>
<p>What has officials puzzled is a cold Edgar caught last month, shortly after 450 of the town's 3,000 residents were diagnosed with acute respiratory illnesses. Edgar, whose symptoms included a headache and fever, was given antibiotics and recovered in days.</p>
<p>But the state's governor visited last Monday, telling Edgar's mother her son's brief cold the month before was the country's earliest identified case of swine flu. Of 35 sick residents tested, only Edgar was found to have had swine flu.</p>
<p>As a result of Edgar's test results, residents of the small hillside town fear that some of the hundreds of colds were, in fact, swine flu, and point to a massive pig farm eight kilometres upwind as evidence.</p>
<p>Officials are shooting down the theory, and a U.S. company that owns part of the pig farm said it has no confirmed cases in its animals or staff.</p>
<p>But some residents nevertheless believe their town to be ground zero of the outbreak.</p>
<p>“When we saw it on the television, we said to ourselves, ‘This is what we had,' ” La Gloria resident Jose Luis Martinez, 34, said on Monday. “It all came from here. … The symptoms they are suffering are the same that we had here.”</p>
<p>The theory of the 450 La Gloria residents who have had respiratory problems and who blame the nearby farm appears to fall in line with the observations of a U.S. company, Veratect, that tracks disease outbreaks globally. It has been following the respiratory illnesses in Edgar's hometown for nearly a month.</p>
<p>Its chronology suggests a connection between the pig farm and whatever sickened the town's residents. Earlier this month, Veratect reported statements by a municipal health official in Mexico “that preliminary investigations indicated that the disease vector was a type of fly that reproduces in pig waste and that the outbreak was linked to the pig farms. It was unclear whether health officials had identified a suspected pathogen responsible for this outbreak.”</p>
<p>But health officials in Mexico and abroad have said the swine flu virus, despite its name, is not solely caused by pigs. Swine influenza A H1N1 is a genetic mixture of viruses seen in pigs, birds and humans.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods</span>, a U.S. company that owns part of the nearby farm, said in a statement yesterday that it has found no clinical signs or symptoms of swine influenza in its herd or among its employees at the joint venture in Mexico.</p>
<p>“Those operations are fully co-operating with Mexican officials and are submitting samples from their swine herds to confirm the absence of North American influenza,” the company stated.</p>
<p>Keiji Fukuda, the World Health Organization's assistant director-general for health security and environment, said “it's too early right now to speculate about the origins” of the new strain of swine flu that has appeared in Mexico.</p>
<p>A Canadian expert said it's unlikely the farm was the starting point. Cate Dewey, chair of the department of population medicine at the University of Guelph and professor of swine health management and epidemiology, said that while residents near a pig farm may have respiratory concerns, it doesn't mean it's swine flu.</p>
<p>“Are they concerned about the smell of the pigs in the air? Quite likely. Does this have anything to do with swine flu? Probably not,” she said.</p>
<p>Prof. Dewey said there's no evidence that this particular strain of influenza is in the pig population or can even grow in pigs.</p>
<p>“It's quite unlikely that it came from the nearby pig farm,” she said.</p>
<p>“If the nearby pig farm had an outbreak of a new flu, then samples of those pigs would have gone to the lab, they would have got the virus out of those pigs and identified it as a new virus.”</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters who have descended upon her small town, Edgar's mother, Maria del Carmen Hernandez, wasn't holding out hope that officials will ever pinpoint whether her son was, in fact, the first victim of a flu that has killed 152 people in Mexico so far.</p>
<p>“If the people who are supposed to be familiar with this didn't know what it was, how will we ever know how my son got it?”</p>

<p>There's usually not much reason to celebrate when a vacation must be cancelled abruptly. But yesterday was the exception for people planning vacations in Mexico as they learned that the government's travel advisory means their travel insurance will kick in if they stay home rather than risk contracting swine flu.</p>
<p>Carolyn Condon-Burns, a travel agent at Carlson Wagonlit Travel in Peterborough, Ont., had been on the phone with one of her clients eight times since Monday trying to find a way to get her out of her trip without major penalties. Yesterday, she was finally able to deliver some good news.</p>
<p>“She was going to vacation south of Cancun with her daughter and figured she didn't want to take that chance,” Condon-Burns says. “Thankfully, she had insurance and it was triggered by the government warning.”</p>
<p>The World Health Organization upped its pandemic alert level to Phase 4 from Phase 3 Monday, a sign of the increasing severity of the outbreak, though the United Nations agency maintained yesterday that it didn't see a swine flu pandemic as inevitable. The flu has been linked to the deaths of about 150 Mexicans, and 12 Canadians have been diagnosed, though their symptoms have been mild.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada issued its travel warning late Monday.</p>
<p>Condon-Burns says 95 per cent of her clients opt for travel insurance, which can include clauses that cover sickness and allow for flights home in the case of a family emergency. “If they turn it down, I'll bring it back up two or three times to try and get them to change their minds.”</p>
<p>Insurance costs vary by destination and duration, but in the case of the mother heading to Mexico, it cost $102 on a $1,500 package. Some credit-card companies also provide users with cancellation insurance.</p>
<p>Yesterday, tour operator <span class="companylink">Transat A.T</span>. announced it is cancelling flights to Mexico and rescheduling packaged holidays to the country for June. As of press time yesterday, Air Canada and <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines</span> had not changed their schedules.</p>
<p>Passengers with both Transat and Air Canada Vacations can rebook trips for any time before Oct. 31 without penalty.</p>
<p>In both instances, there are no penalties to reschedule, though there may be costs if the new trip is more expensive.</p>
<p>Cancelling shouldn't necessarily be someone's first instinct, Condon-Burns says. The breakout is centred in Mexico City and, as of yesterday, other parts of the country appeared to be less affected.</p>
<p>The Canadian government suggests travellers take precautions for travel, regardless of the warning – such as flu shots, frequent handwashing, and covering coughs and sneezes.</p>

<p>Free pandemic tool kit online</p>
<p>THE International Centre for Infectious Diseases has a free online pandemic tool kit for businesses fretting about how they will function if employee absenteeism skyrockets. President Terry Duguid said up to 75 per cent of businesses haven't considered the impact a flu pandemic will have, despite the fact that between 25 and 50 per cent of employees won't come to work during a severe pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's a double-whammy right now," Duguid said, noting Mexican businesses have suffered a huge blow from travel restrictions. "All businesses in North America are experiencing a recession and (swine flu) is piled on top."</p>

<p>TRANSAT AT, Canada's largest leisure travel company, announced on Tuesday it is bringing its customers and employees in Mexico back to this country and cancelling all flights until June 1.</p>
<p>As well, Carnival Cruise Lines has decided not to drop anchor at any Mexican ports.</p>
<p>Samantha Charron, spokeswoman for CAA Manitoba, said direct flights from Winnipeg to Mexico had already ended last month before the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>But Charron said Winnipeggers can still get to and from Mexico through Toronto, but even there people are changing their plans.</p>
<p>"Air Canada is giving their customers the option to reschedule flights at no extra cost," she said.</p>
<p>"We have a couple who are doing that right now."</p>
<p>Charron said CAA has already advised their travel agents what to say if someone calls wanting to go to Mexico.</p>
<p>"We'll advise them not to and refer them to the Health Canada update. If they still want to travel, we'll tell them they are travelling at their own risk."</p>
<p>With the travel industry already reeling from a recession, Charron said the swine flu outbreak doesn't help.</p>
<p>"But if this was winter, there would be a lot more damage," she said.</p>
<p>"Had this been in December there would have been a lot more trouble."</p>

<p>physician and writer Vincent Lam, of the 2006 book The</p>
<p>Flu Pandemic and You:</p>
<p>A Canadian Guide.</p>
<p>Every year thousands die of flu. What makes this outbreak of swine flu different?</p>
<p>This particular swine flu is worrisome because it appears to be close to fulfilling the requirements for a pandemic flu strain. It is a new strain that we have never seen before in humans. We likely have little immunity to it and do not currently have an effective vaccine against it.</p>
<p>It seems to be virulent, meaning it causes serious illness, at least in Mexico, where there have been a number of hospitalizations and deaths, particularly in the young and healthy. This is reminiscent of the 1918 Spanish Flu. However, outside of Mexico, the cases appear milder, including those in Canada. Finally, it seems to be contagious from person-to-person, as those who are ill do not seem to have contracted it from pigs.</p>
<p>What are the most important questions epidemiologists are now trying to answer about this flu?</p>
<p>The most important questions are: How contagious it is from person-to-person; how virulent (its ability to cause serious illness); and, can we make a vaccine against it if this becomes a pandemic? The investment to make a vaccine is huge and to do it, you have to isolate the flu strain, which only happened four days ago. From the time you isolate it to producing a vaccine takes four to six months. Scientists have begun the process of making a vaccine, but whether or not it comes to fruition in time depends on many factors, including how the outbreak progresses.</p>
<p>Why do scientists think that, so far, only those sick in Mexico have died from this flu?</p>
<p>There are a number of hypotheses. Mexicans may be more susceptible because of genetic factors or medical conditions. There may be a lot more Mexicans who have a mild version of this flu but who are not been seen and therefore not officially counted. They may not have gone to a doctor or hospital. Or, if they did, may not have been tested, given Mexico's limited testing capabilities. If this is the case, the percentage of those in Mexico who have serious illness is currently being overestimated. It is also possible we have not seen enough cases outside of Mexico to see serious illness. Or, the virus may have mutated in the past weeks and become less virulent outside of Mexico.</p>
<p>Why is this important to know?</p>
<p>If this flu can cause serious illness and death, this is more ominous, and makes it more likely it could become a pandemic strain.</p>
<p>In your book, you note that most governments were preparing for a pandemic of avian flu, and now we have so-called swine flu. What is the difference?</p>
<p>In terms of preparation for a pandemic, there is no difference. We have been preparing for a flu pandemic whose origin could be avian or swine. The difference has to do with genetic makeup. The current strain of H1N1 has most of its origins in swine, while H5N1 “bird flu” has most of its origins in birds.</p>
<p>In 1976, there was a small outbreak of swine flu in a U.S. military camp which infected about 230 soldiers. A dozen were seriously ill and one died. At that time, the U.S. government believed it was likely a pandemic strain and produced a swine flu vaccine and began vaccinating the population.</p>
<p>Any advice you can give people who are worried about a flu pandemic?</p>
<p>During the last two pandemics, in 1957 and 1968, the most vulnerable were those who were the least healthy – the elderly and people with medical conditions. The best way to prepare for a pandemic is to be as healthy as possible before one. Eat healthily, exercise, and get your recommended vaccinations. As well, have an emergency kit of supplies at home, including non-perishable food, batteries, a flashlight, candles and matches. If you are taking prescription medication, keep an extra month's supply. Stock up on contraceptives, pain killers, multivitamins and oral re-hydration fluids. During the Spanish Flu of 1918, healthy young adults and pregnant women were more vulnerable than usual, though researchers aren't sure why.</p>
<p>Why does the World Health Organization say travel advisories are of no use, and may make things worse?</p>
<p>Historically, travel advisories and quarantine measures do not seem to have prevented the spread of pandemics, even in times when air travel was less common than today. Travel advisories can cause anxiety and panic. During SARS, travel advisories did not seem to decrease its spread.</p>

<div>THE EXPLAINER: RICHARD BLACKWELL ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON THE FINANCIAL CRISIS</div>
<div>Report on Business: Money & Markets</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Rating a worst-case scenario for swine flu</b>
</div><div>RICHARD BLACKWELL   </div>
<div>336 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>What's the worst-case scenario for the economy if there is a full-fledged swine flu pandemic?</p>
<p>Last year, the World Bank issued a report that said a severe worldwide flu pandemic of the proportions of the 1918-19 Spanish flu outbreak could cost $3.1-trillion (U.S.) and dent global gross domestic product by 4.8 per cent.</p>
<p>The report, written in the wake of concerns about a possible avian flu pandemic, said a severe influenza outbreak could kill as many as 71 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Considering that the current economic meltdown will cut worldwide GDP by 1.3 per cent this year (according to the International Monetary Fund), a drop of almost four times that magnitude would be devastating. However, the chances of an outbreak that severe are considered very remote.</p>
<p>What did the World Bank project for a milder outbreak?</p>
<p>In a less severe scenario, with about 1.4 million deaths around the world, global GDP would fall by about 0.7 per cent, the agency said. This simulation is based on the Hong Kong flu outbreak of 1968-1969.</p>
<p>The employment insurance numbers released yesterday looked pretty grim, especially in the West. How bad are things in Alberta now?</p>
<p>The number of people receiving employment insurance benefits in Western Canada has risen dramatically.</p>
<p>In Alberta, the number of recipients jumped 27 per cent between January and February, and almost doubled year over year to 30,630.</p>
<p>In Calgary alone, there were 114 per cent more people on EI in February than a year earlier, reaching 11,690. In Edmonton the numbers rose 96 per cent, to 10,880.</p>
<p>Outside Alberta, the city with the worst rise in EI claims was Windsor, Ont., the home of several automotive manufacturing plants. There, the number of claimants jumped 104 per cent year over year to 11,660.</p>

<p>The recent swine flu outbreak won't have any impact on Central Saanich's Vantreight Farms, which employs migrant Mexican workers, because the workers are already here, said Ian Vantreight. "We've got all that we're going to be bringing up this season already up now," he said. Vantreight Farms, one of the biggest on the Peninsula, employed 75 Mexican workers for picking of daffodils earlier this spring. They arrived here in February, and they are permitted to stay in the country for up to eight months.</p>

<p>The swine flu outbreak is viral in real life -- and on the Internet.</p>
<p>As the disease spreads across the globe, chatter about swine flu has exploded on Twitter and other social networking sites as people seek information and speculate on the scale of the outbreak.</p>
<p>Some are advising people not to eat pork -- despite health officials saying it is not necessary -- while others are openly asserting the outbreak could be a form of "germ warfare."</p>
<p>Spammers are cashing in on people's fears by sending millions of e-mails peddling counterfeit drugs as remedies.</p>
<p>As online gossip mounts, experts are urging web users not to spread panic about the swine flu outbreak and be careful about the swirl of misinformation. "You cannot catch swine flu by using Twitter," contributor Robert Cringely wrote on PCWorld website.</p>

<p>Feeling feverish, coughing, aching all over?</p>
<p>Stay home and put yourself in isolation for seven days or until the symptoms disappear, emphasizes Dr. Richard Stanwick, Vancouver Island Health Authority chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>That will be the main tool in fighting the expected increase in numbers of Vancouver Island residents with swine flu, he said.</p>
<p>"In our efforts as a country to control this particular virus, it is critical we have a social contract with the community that if people are sick [they should] stay home," Stanwick said.</p>
<p>"One of the big problems we have experienced with influenza generally is that people have another condition called presentitis -- they have to show up for work. ... Cemeteries are full of irreplaceable people," he said.</p>
<p>Ideally, one person should act as a caregiver to limit the spread and people who have been in close contact with the infected person -- meaning they could have been in contact with saliva -- should be informed, Stanwick said.</p>
<p>Those who believe they have swine flu should alert their doctor, walk-in clinic or hospital emergency department before visiting. Go to the emergency department if you are having difficulty breathing or shortness of breath as staff are now on heightened alert and will be looking for cases of pneumonia, but go to your doctor or stay home if you have a case of the sniffles, said Dr. Simon Hoogewerf, South Island chief of emergency medicine.</p>
<p>"We are prepared to care for people who are truly sick and, if they need further care in hospital, I hope we are able to manage that," he said. "But if everyone in the city who has a fever and headache comes in we will be swamped. We can't cope with that."</p>
<p>As more cases are identified it is increasingly important to sneeze or cough into your arm, held high over nose and mouth, said Stanwick, demonstrating the technique.</p>
<p>Also, don't rub your eyes or pick your nose and use hand-hygiene products before collecting a grocery cart.</p>
<p>Tamiflu is most effective during the first two days of being struck by the virus and helps reduce infection rates, but it is hoped a vaccine will be developed shortly.</p>
<p>If it is a pandemic, the second wave is usually the killer and that could be expected in three to seven months, Stanwick said.</p>
<p>However, it should be put in the context of 4,000 people who die annually in Canada from other types of influenza, he said.</p>

<p>A Saanich man who sells protective face masks says sales have skyrocketed in last few days as fears escalate around the swine-flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Since Saturday, Bob Butler has sold about 29,000 masks to people looking to stockpile the disposable blue masks in case the virus scare turns into a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>That's about five times the activity Butler's business received during recent outbreaks of the avian flu, the virus that sparked him to launch his website www.survivetheflu.com[http://www.survivetheflu.com] a few years ago.</p>
<p>"It was a complete surprise. I woke up [Saturday] and had orders for thousands of masks," he said, adding they are being bought by individuals by the box-load.</p>
<p>The masks are being scooped up mostly by Americans, Butler said, many in California and states that share a border with Mexico, where more than 150 people have died from the flu. Only about five per cent of his customers are from Canada, he said, with no buyers from British Columbia.</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">Alpha Pro Tech</span> N-95 Particulate Respirator that Butler sells is manufactured in Arizona and distributed from a warehouse in Michigan.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, warned Monday that Canadians will likely see more severe cases of the virus, possibly causing death, and that if it develops into a pandemic, the public will have to take extra precautions.</p>
<p>"My opinion is that if there is a pandemic, and people are dying from it, it would be absolutely foolish not to have masks," Butler said.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't venture out into the public at all without wearing a mask [in the case of a pandemic]."</p>
<p>While there is a chance the virus can seep through the pores of the mask, he said they can trap a sneeze or a cough and can prevent people from touching their face if their hands come in contact with the virus.</p>
<p>However, the Vancouver Island Health Authority's medical director for microbiology and infection control cautions that at this stage, masks aren't necessary.</p>
<p>"You just have to wear masks when making close contact with people [with the virus] within one metre," said Pamela Kibsey. "For casual activities like walking down the street, you don't need a mask."</p>
<p>She said people just have to use caution like washing their hands often and using hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Butler acknowledged some people might be panicking prematurely but it's better to be safe than sorry.</p>
<p>He said the masks are already growing scarce, with one supplier of a more sophisticated breathing mask upping its price 50 per cent to about $13 each. (His sell for $34.95 US for a box of 35 masks.)</p>

</p>
<p>A 30-year-old Victoria woman who recently returned from a resort in Cancun, Mexico, is Vancouver Island's first confirmed case in the swine flu outbreak that is spreading across the world.</p>
<p>Seven new cases were confirmed in Canada yesterday -- Michelle Bossi of Victoria, along with two in Alberta, four in Ontario and one in British Columbia -- adding to six announced Sunday. All have links with travel to Mexico, where the illness is suspected of killing at least 150 people and of sickening more than 1,600. About 80 cases are now confirmed in other countries.</p>
<p>The new cases came as Canada bolstered screening at airports, issued a travel warning telling Canadians to delay their trips, and airlines cancelled flights to affected areas in Mexico.</p>
<p>Bossi, who is recovering at home after being tested at Royal Jubilee Hospital late Saturday, worries that she might have inadvertently spread the virus after originally being told by health professionals that she was not contagious.</p>
<p>"I'm fine," Bossi said yesterday after learning that her test results were confirmed by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver earlier in the day. But she added: "I'm annoyed I could have affected other people."</p>
<p>Bossi returned to Canada on Saturday after she and a friend fell ill on Thursday while in Cancun. After being examined by a doctor, they went to a hospital where they they were given an IV, an X-ray, medication and a mask. Bossi said they were told they had bronchitis and advised to stay in the hospital.</p>
<p>But the women wanted to get home on their return Sunwing charter flight to Vancouver early Saturday morning. Bossi noted a lot of fellow passengers were coughing during the flight. "An abnormal amount."</p>
<p>Bossi wore a mask on her flight to Vancouver and while travelling by bus and the 1 p.m. ferry to Victoria.</p>
<p>When she arrived, her mother took her directly to Royal Jubilee Hospital's emergency department where, after a 60-minute wait, she explained she had just been in Mexico and was really sick. She raised the possibility of swine flu.</p>
<p>Bossi was placed in isolation and, after several hours, was given an IV and medication to help reduce her fever. She also underwent tests. Around midnight, Bossi said she was told she did not have the flu, was not contagious and could go home.</p>
<p>But late Sunday afternoon, she received a call from the Vancouver Island Health Authority saying swine flu was a possibility and she should stay home for a week.</p>
<p>The swine flu was not confirmed until yesterday morning because specimens taken from Bossi on Saturday were not sent to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control for testing until the next appropriate flight, which was on Monday, said Dr. Pamela Kibsey, the health authority's medical director for microbiology and infection control.</p>
<p>VIHA officials say that despite the delay in diagnosis, all proper protocols were followed, and there were no undue risks of spreading the infection. People providing care to anyone with a flu-like illness should wear a mask, but there is little threat through casual contact, said Kibsey. "It is spread through saliva. Even if you are in the line of fire of a forceful cough, it's a one-metre direct saliva spread."</p>

<p>On April 2, a 4-year-old boy was stricken with H1N1 swine flu virus in the state of Veracruz, Mexico. Citizens in Veracruz had been protesting the pollution caused by a large pig farm. According to The Associated Press, two days after the first reported victim, a health alert was declared in the town of La Gloria, also in Veracruz, when 60 per cent of the 3,000 inhabitants came down with the flu. This week, Mexico City closed schools, museums and sporting events. The death toll in Mexico is 152 and counting - and the virus is spreading fast.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization (WHO) has raised its pandemic alert status to phase four, meaning that there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, warns: "Nobody should take this for granted in any way."</p>
<p>Globalization is full of delights, such as a group of Nova Scotia high-school students travelling to Mexico to learn about a different language and culture. But it is full of dangers, too, as a virus that jumps from animals to humans in any part of the world is only a plane ride away from Halifax or Toronto. A 2008 paper prepared for a Queen's University conference on pandemic preparedness declared: "An interdependent, interconnected and highly mobile world appears to be concurrent with potential and extant threats to global public health security on scales heretofore unimagined."</p>
<p>New diseases are appearing, and old ones are re-emerging, at an unprecedented rate. Nearly 40 previously unknown diseases have been identified since the 1970s, and the WHO has recorded more than 1,100 epidemic occurrences in the last five years. Currently, between 60 and 80 per cent of all new diseases are animal-born. More than 2.1 billion people travelled by air in 2006. As the H1N1 Mexican swine flu virus has demonstrated, these characteristics of our modern world ensure that public health outbreaks are no longer local tragedies; they are instead global menaces.</p>
<p>In response to this evident threat, the WHO has promulgated International Health Regulations (IHR) to protect the global community. After the 2003 SARS outbreak, the WHO revised the regulations to require that all international public health risks should be immediately reported to the WHO (China had held back information about SARS); that a global surveillance system should be built; and that states, especially the undeveloped, should be assisted in developing proactive response capacity. The 193 member states of the WHO must assess their current public health infrastructure by this year, and all states have promised to meet the new IHR requirements by 2012.</p>
<p>These International Health Regulations are the primary international management weapon in the battle against infectious disease outbreaks. The H1N1 outbreak demonstrates how urgent it is that the 2009 and 2012 goals be met.</p>
<p>It is one thing to sign an international treaty promising to develop a proactive response capability; it is another thing to achieve it. Many countries do not have the resources or expertise to achieve these tasks. And if domestic capacity is lacking in much of the world, so, too, is the capacity of the international organization most concerned: the WHO. In 2008-09, the assessed contributions of all WHO members provided a little more than $900 million (U.S.) a year, about the same as the police budget for the City of Toronto. The Gates Foundation spends as much on public health as the core budget of the WHO. The WHO also receives voluntary contribution from states, private foundations, the World Bank etc. But its total health budget from all sources for all world diseases is only $4.2 billion (U.S.). The 2009 City of Toronto budget is $8.7 billion (Canadian). One Canadian city alone has double the budget of the organization responsible for world health. The capacity gap between what we expect and require the WHO to do, and what it can actually do, is enormous.</p>
<p>Canada can help close this yawning capacity gap. The single greatest security threat to Canada is not the Taliban in Afghanistan but the inability of countries in Africa, Asia and South America to develop public health capacity to monitor and treat infectious disease. Improving global public health should become the central priority in our foreign policy, national security and development agenda.</p>
<p>Beyond money, Canada also has ideas and expertise to offer. Dr. Dick Zoutman of Queen's University, for example, has created a pandemic portal that assists smaller and rural Ontario hospitals in pandemic planning, online training, mentoring and regular monitoring. What works in Ontario can work just as well in Mexico, Indonesia and Nigeria.</p>
<p>Universal vulnerability means universal responsibility. Global public health security demands that all nations work together to build up capacity. Countries must work hard to overcome the obstacles that prevent them from implementing the IHR. Canada has the right combination of interests, values and expertise to lead the international health community in the fight for global health security. Helping the world combat disease combines the idealism of Canadian values with the hard-headed realism of preventing epidemics from coming here.</p>

<p>Four healthy people in their 20s who recently returned from trips to Mexico have become Ontario's first confirmed cases of swine flu, provincial health authorities say.</p>
<p>Three of the patients, all female, live in Durham Region and the other, a male, is from York Region.</p>
<p>All are recovering at home from mild cases of the flu, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health, said yesterday.</p>
<p>The total number of confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada grew to 13 yesterday as Alberta confirmed its first two cases, and British Columbia confirmed its third. Nova Scotia had already reported four cases of the flu.</p>
<p>The previously unknown virus has killed up to 159 Mexicans and made as many as 6,000 ill.</p>
<p>There are 68 confirmed cases in the U.S. and confirmed cases have been reported in Israel, New Zealand, Scotland and Spain.</p>
<p>Hundreds of students at St. Francis Preparatory in Queens, N.Y. developed symptoms consistent with swine flu, although many hadn't been tested to confirm it, officials said. Some students recently went on a spring break trip to Mexico.</p>
<p>U.S. President Barack Obama asked Congress for $1.5 billion in emergency funds to fight the fast-spreading disease. The funds would help build drug stockpiles and monitor future cases as well as help international efforts.</p>
<p>Montreal-based travel giant Transat AT announced plans to bring home Canadians booked into Mexican resorts and cancel flights to Mexico until June 1. Customers scheduled to fly to Mexico between now and June 1 can change their travel plans at no additional cost.</p>
<p>Air Canada and Air Canada Vacations also announced the suspension of all operations to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta until June 1, 2009. Customers booked for travel between April 28 and June 1, 2009, inclusive, can rebook at no extra cost. Air Canada plans to maintain flights to Mexico City.</p>
<p>Toronto public health officials held a news conference to outline the city's pandemic preparedness plan, saying the city is well-stocked and well-prepared for a major outbreak.</p>
<p>The four Ontario residents had the same strain of swine influenza A (H1N1) that is circulating in the United States and in Mexico, Williams said during a press conference yesterday. The four were seen within seven days of their return.</p>
<p>"All illnesses are mild and the individuals are recovering at home," Williams said.</p>
<p>Health experts are puzzled as to why the illnesses in the U.S. and Canada are milder than the cases in Mexico and are awaiting more data from Mexican authorities.</p>
<p>Each Ontario patient suffered fever, cough and respiratory ailments but none was hospitalized or given antiviral medication, said Williams.</p>
<p>He did not provide further information other than to say some of the four did travel together.</p>
<p>Another 20 potential cases are under investigation, said Williams.</p>
<p>Ottawa has issued a travel advisory warning Canadians to postpone all non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the newly confirmed cases would not change what authorities are doing to respond to the outbreak.</p>
<p>"These cases were anticipated by public health officials and do not change our course of action," he told a news conference in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director general at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said researchers have now learned the incubation period is from two to seven days, which is comparable to the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty encouraged Ontarians to "stay calm" and trust the government has learned the lessons of the 2003 SARS outbreak killed 44 people, quarantined thousands, and ravaged the local tourism industry.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The fear of eating pork spread globally yesterday even though public health authorities insist there is no evidence that the new swine flu strain can be caught from bacon or any other food.</p>
<p>That did not stop Ukraine from banning live hogs and pork products from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. South Korea banned swine from all three countries but is still testing pork products, and veterinary authorities in Croatia reported a ban on all imports of live hogs from North and South America.</p>
<p>International Trade Minister Stockwell Day decried the move.</p>
<p>"There is no scientifically justifiable reason to impose trade restrictions on pork or pork products from Canada," Day said through his spokesperson, Melisa Leclerc.</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council sent an open letter to Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq yesterday asking her to change the name of the virus to "North American influenza."</p>
<p>La Gloria, a small town in the Veracruz mountains whose residents have been protesting pollution at a large nearby hog farm half-owned by Virginia-based <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods Inc</span>., has been described as the "ground zero" of the outbreak after Mexican authorities said their first confirmed case of the H1N1 virus was a 4-year-old boy there.</p>
<p>Smithfield issued a statement yesterday saying there is no evidence of the flu in any of its swineherds or employees at any of its operations around the world.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency said its representatives in Mexico are investigating the Smithfield connection but all information so far indicates the herd at its farm near La Gloria did not have any illness.</p>
<p>The CFIA has also asked private veterinarians and hog producers to be on the alert for any flu-like illness in Canadian swineherds and send any samples to the National Centre for Foreign Animal Diseases in Winnipeg. So far, nothing has shown up.</p>
<p>"This appears to be uniquely and strictly a human health issue and animals do not appear to be playing a role or a part in the disease transmission or origin of it," said Dr. Jim Clark, national manager for disease control in the CFIA's animal health division.</p>
<p>Clark agreed with public health officials that there was no need to test pork products. "There is no test that I'm aware of that could be applied to food in general that would be able to detect influenza virus should it be present."</p>
<p>Clark also said Canada has never imported any live animals from Mexico and does not import pork products from the country.</p>

<p>LEAMINGTON, Ont. -- Manuel Martinez arrived from Mexico Monday night and sailed through Pearson airport without problems or questions on his way to a job as a farm worker.</p>
<p>Sitting in Tony's Tacos here yesterday, Martinez, 63, and five other farm workers said they were tested in Mexico for swine flu symptoms before boarding their Air Canada flight.</p>
<p>"We had no problem leaving Mexico," said Martinez, who comes from Oaxaca, where the first death from swine flu occurred.</p>
<p>Williams Nursery in Leamington had already been told its farm workers would be delayed, said Mary Vidal of the Agricultural Workers Alliance, which is run by the United Food and Commercial Workers Union.</p>
<p>She started handing out Spanish-language flyers yesterday to the 4,000 farm workers, most of them from Mexico, who arrived in January to work in the Leamington greenhouses.</p>
<p>St. Michael's Church in Leamington also warned workers at Sunday mass to watch for symptoms.</p>
<p>The fear isn't for workers here: it's for what an undetected, asymptomatic case of swine flu might do in the crowded bunk houses the workers will be living in all summer as the growing season gets into full swing.</p>
<p>"I don't think the hospitals are ready for it if it grows," said Vidal.</p>
<p>Farm workers are at less risk than temporary foreign workers because they are part of a government program and are getting increased screening, said Dr. Jenna Hennebry, associate director of the International Migration Research Centre at Wilfrid Laurier University.</p>
<p>Tied to one employer and not tracked by either the Mexican or Canadian governments, the temporary foreign workers are arriving to work in construction, meat packing, hotels, farms and the food industry without the same surveillance as farm workers, she said.</p>
<p>"They are more at risk," Hennebry said. "They have to wait three months for health care. The health authorities need to set up immediate clinics."</p>
<p>Public health authorities she has been talking to seem to realize the urgency of testing on southern Ontario farms, where the first wave of 15,000 migrant workers begins arriving this weekend.</p>
<p>"These farmers would be done, probably forever. The cost would be in the billions" if swine flu strangled the supply of migrant workers or infected their ranks here, said Ken Forth, spokesperson for Foreign Agricultural Resource Management Services, which oversees the seasonal workers program.</p>
<p>Farm worker activist Evelyn Encalada Grez said she is infuriated at how Mexican workers were being screened "when there are hundreds of Canadians flying back from Mexico. "I had no problems getting back to Canada (from Mexico) on Sunday," she said. "There was no screening of any sort."</p>

<p>A designed-in-Toronto face mask, born out of the 2003 SARS crisis, is catching the attention of governments and health-care institutions around the world as fears of a swine flu pandemic continue to soar.</p>
<p>Toronto-based FaceSeal Technologies is already working with officials in Mexico, and is fielding requests for its next-generation face masks from Israel, Germany, Korea and the Philippines.</p>
<p>Hospitals, paramedic personnel and other front-line health services in Canada and the U.S. are also interested in the mask.</p>
<p>"We are trying to rev up production as quickly as possible because we are getting so many demands," said Dr. Gabor Lantos, a co-inventor of the face mask and director of personal protective equipment development at FaceSeal Technologies. The form-fitting face mask, technically called a respirator and dubbed FitSeal, adheres to the face without the need for elastic bands and completely seals off the nose and mouth. Lantos said FitSeal is designed to better protect front-line workers from airborne infectious disease, including influenza.</p>
<p>The face masks currently used for protection against infectious disease are held in place with elastic bands and use metallic clips to form a seal around the nose, said Lantos.</p>
<p>These N95 respirators can be easily dislodged, which allows air underneath the mask, he said.</p>
<p>"Anybody who has worn one will tell you they are difficult to breathe in, hard to wear for any length of time and it's hard to communicate with one on," said Lantos.</p>
<p>Another problem with the current masks is the wearer must find the right brand, model and size to fit properly and create a protective seal, he said.</p>

<p>"You know there's a (federal) travel advisory out on Mexico?" nurse Jean Sawyer asked warily yesterday, after we told her we were off to Mexico City.</p>
<p>Yes, we know. But covering the swine flu outbreak in Mexico is the whole point for Toronto Star photographer Carlos Osorio and me, so we'd arrived early yesterday at Medisys Travel Health Clinic on Edward St., in Toronto, to prepare.</p>
<p>Somehow, I had imagined one shot and then I'd be immune to whatever flu strain is causing the damage. But, unfortunately, that's not how it works.</p>
<p>Instead, Sawyer gave us both prescriptions for Tamiflu, 75 milligram tablets, and instructions on how to take them as either a preventative or in case of flu.</p>
<p>The odds? With Tamiflu, she said, we'd have a 30 per cent chance of not getting sick. The other side of that equation doesn't look so good.</p>
<p>Then, she prescribed super-strength Cipro tablets as an anti-biotic for serious intestinal distress (as a former foreign correspondent, I've probably taken crates of Cipro) and recommended an antidiarrheal and rehydration salts, as well as handwipes and face masks.</p>
<p>She finished by bringing us both up to date on our travel shots.</p>
<p>At Victor Pharmacy downstairs, Victor Lee had only 18 boxes of Tamiflu left by mid-morning - so it's going fast. Sawyer said it's in short supply. Another recommended anti-flu agent isn't available yet, Lee said.</p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p>I'm about to take my first Tamiflu tablet. Here's hoping.</p>
<p>Any way to have better odds? I asked Sawyer.</p>
<p>"Well," she said, "don't go."</p>

<p>Swine flu lands in Canada,</p>
<p>April 27</p>
<p>I'm concerned. The news in America is focused on creating abject panic regarding swine flu. American media have done nothing to explain the event, much less dissuade the population of panic. I suspect it's because it sells.</p>
<p>Markedly, CBC - a national treasure worth supporting at any cost, I think - the other night presented a "just the facts, ma'am" explanation of what's taking place.</p>

<p>Swine flu outbreak: What you need</p>
<p>to know, April 27</p>
<p>As with every other media outlet, the Star is quick to reassure us that pork is still safe to eat. However, there is no mention of the deeper connection between our excessive consumption of meat, factory farming and the spread of deadly disease.</p>
<p>Meat production has increased 500 per cent since 1950 in order to feed not only our growing population but our growing consumption. Mad cow disease, foot and mouth disease, avian flu and now swine flu are all recent outbreaks, all connected to intensive, industrialized agriculture, and all are deadly.</p>
<p>How many times do we have to see the rise of possible pandemics before we connect the dots?</p>

<p>Thousands of Canadians could have their holiday plans disrupted as tour operators cancel Mexico bookings over the next month in the wake of the widening swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Transat AT Inc</span>., Canada's largest tour operator, said yesterday it is "postponing" flights from Canada to Mexico operated by Transat and its partner airlines until June 1.</p>
<p>However, the seller of packaged holidays will maintain its schedule of return flights, and will be adding new flights to bring home customers, passengers and about 20 employees now in Mexico.</p>
<p>Transat said it took the measures because of the World Health Organization's decision to raise its alert to Level 4, with Level 6 being a full blown pandemic, and because of travel directives issued by governments of several countries, including Canada.</p>
<p>Air Canada and Air Canada Vacations are also suspending flights to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta until June 1 due to the outbreak.</p>
<p>The airline will maintain service to Mexico City and flights to Cancun, Cozumel and Puerto will continue until May 4 to bring home passengers.</p>
<p>Affected customers of both carriers will be allowed to rebook at a later date or travel to another destination, the companies said. However, passengers must cover the price difference if the rebooked vacations are more expensive and will not receive refunds.</p>
<p>"We're trying to offer people the best alternative possible," said Transat spokesperson Jean-Michel Laberge, who added that Transat will continue to evaluate the situation as it unfolds.</p>
<p>Similarly, <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span> said yesterday it was cancelling trips until June 4, giving passengers the option to rebook to other destinations, while Sunwing Vacations has cancelled all trips until May 29.</p>
<p>In the United States, Carnival Cruise Lines and <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean Cruises</span> have cancelled stops at Mexican ports over concerns about swine flu.</p>
<p>The moves come as Ontario health officials confirmed four cases in the Greater Toronto Area while another two were confirmed in Alberta, bringing the total confirmed cases in Canada to 13.</p>
<p>No deaths related to swine flu have been reported outside of Mexico so far. The country is at the epicentre of the outbreak, with 1,900 people ill and 150 deaths reported.</p>
<p>WestJet and WestJet Vacations announced last night that it will cease service to Cancun, Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta effective Monday. It plans to resume flights to Cabo San Lucas, Mazatlan and Puerto Vallarta on June 20, but service to Cancun, a seasonal destination for WestJet, won't return until the fall schedule.</p>
<p>On Monday, the Public Health Agency of Canada issued an advisory for Mexico, warning against all non-essential travel.</p>

<p>The Toronto stock market closed lower again yesterday, as investors continued to take profits from a seven-week-old spring rally.</p>
<p>New York markets closed relatively unchanged, as the release of a better-than-expected reading of U.S. consumer confidence helped investors deal with fresh concerns about banks.</p>
<p>"I think these events that come out of left field, (such as) swine flu, are unfortunate. They cannot be priced and I do not think investors should act or modify their behaviour or base any decision on those factors," said Vincent Delisle, portfolio strategist at Scotia Capital in Montreal.</p>
<p>"The sustainability of this rally will depend on the U.S. economic data coming in ... better than expected, and that's precisely what we got this morning with the U.S. consumer confidence numbers, which were very, very positive."</p>
<p>Toronto's S&P/TSX composite index lost 46.77 points to 9,348.03, dragged down by oil stocks as crude prices remained under pressure on concerns that the spread of swine flu could cut fuel demand.</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">TSX Venture Exchange</span> fell 9.88 points to 993.1 while the Canadian dollar was down 0.07 of a U.S. cent to 81.93 cents.</p>
<p>New York's Dow Jones industrial average slipped 8.05 points to 8,016.95.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index ebbed 5.6 points to 1,673.81, while the S&P 500 index shaved off 2.35 points to 855.16, after the U.S. Conference Board said that its consumer confidence index rose 12 points to 39.2. The reading marks the highest point since November and far surpasses economists' expectations for a level of 29.5.</p>
<p>"This is yet another indicator suggesting that some sort of bottom may have possibly formed in the economy," said BMO Capital Markets senior economist Jennifer Lee.</p>
<p>"Well, at least prior to the latest blow, swine flu, and that will be another test of everyone's will."</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its alert on swine flu to Phase 4, meaning there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus, causing outbreaks in at least one country.</p>
<p>Analysts point out that the market was already vulnerable after a string of gains that have taken the TSX up about 24 per cent since March 10.</p>
<p>"Swine flu or not ... this market will look for reasons to pull back, modestly," Delisle said.</p>

<p>Chuck With Cheese: When it comes to saving the TV series Chuck from cancellation, fans are putting their money - and submarine sandwiches - where their mouths are. With NBC saying it will decide by May 5 whether to order a third season of the show that aired its second season finale on Monday, fans and TV critics have united with a spirited online campaign to save the series from extinction. Chuck airs on Citytv here. Fans urged each other to pack Subway restaurants Monday as part of a campaign to save the show by boosting one of its primary advertisers. Their strategy was to buy a footlong Subway sandwich then fill out a comment card crediting Chuck with the purchase - a nod to a storyline. The show's star, Zachary Levi, gave the campaign a boost when he led hundreds of fans to a Subway in Birmingham, England, over the weekend.</p>
<p>Leno's Sick Laughs: Jay Leno milked his recent illness for jokes on his return to The Tonight Show Monday, riffing off the swine flu outbreak with the line: "What happened was - and I think was a mistake - I ate a raw pig a friend brought back from Mexico.... It was delicious." Leno didn't specify what put him in hospital last Thursday but blamed his 103-degree fever on driving to the Burbank studio on a cold morning in a Model T without a jacket and "ODN, overly dramatic nurse." NBC aired reruns in place of two Tonight shows last week, the first time it had to cover for an ailing Leno since he took over as host in 1992.</p>
<p>Rycroft Takes a Ribbing: Speaking of absentees, last week's top-scoring hoofer and Bachelor reject Melissa Rycroft was missing from Monday's Dancing With the Stars because of a rib injury. Rycroft has been told by doctors she has a hairline fracture but can continue on the ABC reality competition.</p>
<p>Zach May Be Back: ABC is in talks to renew the veteran comedy Scrubs for a ninth season and Variety says star Zach Braff might come back for at least some episodes if it does. Last summer, creator Bill Lawrence and ABC chief Stephen McPherson said they hoped to keep Scrubs going with new cast members, a la NBC's ER, but now it sounds like some or all of the original cast members could be back.</p>
<p>Camera-Shy Conrad Departs Hills: The Hills is losing one of its original cast members. Lauren Conrad is expected to leave at the end of this season, but MTV has announced that the show will be back with regulars Heidi, Audrina, Spencer, Brody, Stephanie, Lo and Justin Bobby. Former Hills star Whitney Port says Conrad's leaving because "she needs to put herself first" and was tired of having a camera in her face at all times</p>

<div id="hd"><b>City prepares for pandemic; Supplies that ran out in last outbreak, including medication, masks and gowns, have been stockpiled</b>
</div><div>Megan Ogilvie and Donovan Vincent   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>773 words</div><div>29 April 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The hard lessons learned during the 2003 SARS outbreak have helped infectious disease experts in Toronto and across the country in preparing for a deadly flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The province and cities, including Toronto, have stockpiled appropriate protective equipment, including gowns, gloves, masks and antibacterial hand sanitizer - critical supplies that, in some institutions, ran out during the SARS crisis.</p>
<p>Two antiviral medications - Tamiflu and Relenza - are stockpiled to protect front-line health care providers.</p>
<p>There is now a new Ontario public health agency. And more money has been invested in what were woefully underfunded public labs before 2003.</p>
<p>Surveillance systems within health care facilities have also improved, so doctors are better able to quickly identify, diagnose and treat significant or unusual disease, says Dr. Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre.</p>
<p>That surveillance, in turn, is better communicated between hospitals, public health authorities and public health labs, he said.</p>
<p>"We are in a much better situation to deal with pandemic influenza now than we were several years ago, largely because of what we learned from the SARS experience," Simor said.</p>
<p>A commission on the SARS outbreak found better surveillance and communication systems could have likely prevented the virus from spreading beyond the initial cluster of cases.</p>
<p>While Toronto has a stockpile for its front-line workers, Peel Region does not, and will rely on the national stockpile, says Dr. Eileen de Villa, associate medical officer of health for the region.</p>
<p>"There is some debate (with) respect to stockpiling," de Villa said yesterday.</p>
<p>Part of that debate is over what amount of Tamiflu should be stockpiled for preventative care, versus treatment for those who are sick.</p>
<p>As for flu assessment centres, de Villa said Peel's plan is to open them if the World Health Organization's alert level for swine flu reaches 6 - it's now at 4 - and if the region's primary care system is "overwhelmed."</p>
<p>Durham's environmental health director, Ken Gorman, said the region's hospitals and physicians are now following the provincial pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"We're on heightened alert," Gorman said.</p>
<p>Durham, unlike Toronto, relies on the provincial stockpile of Tamiflu.</p>
<p>As the Toronto area braces for the prospect of more cases of swine flu - four cases were confirmed yesterday - health officials say plans for a possible pandemic started almost immediately after the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>Toronto's planning and preparedness activities for an influenza pandemic have been under way since 2005, co-ordinated by the Office of Emergency Management under the supervision of the Toronto Emergency Planning Committee, which Mayor David Miller chairs.</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health also has its own pandemic plan.</p>
<p>The health agency issued an alert Monday to hospitals, emergency rooms, infection control practitioners, walk-in clinics and physicians to ensure they are aware of the situation and reporting any cases.</p>
<p>Pandemic plans also outline how hospitals and clinics should deal with a surge of sick, infectious patients, including how to triage patients who come to hospital and how to deal with limited capacity in intensive care units, said Simor.</p>
<p>"Again, that planning was done well in advance so it makes it easier to implement as opposed to SARS where we were doing things by the seat of our pants," he said.</p>
<p>Simor noted there are still areas of pandemic planning that could improve, with the most important being the implementation of electronic health records. These, he said, help communication efforts, allow specialists to collect and share surveillance data in real time and help them analyze a pandemic situation more quickly.</p>
<p>During a press conference at city hall yesterday, held before the four Toronto-area cases were announced, Dr. David McKeown, the city's medical officer of health, said swine flu is "sensitive" to both Tamiflu and Relenza, but no vaccine exists for this strain.</p>
<p>In the meantime, to protect against the virus, health officials are stressing the importance of people washing their hands, covering their mouths when they cough and using their sleeves when they have to sneeze.</p>
<p>Officials also recommend people stay home if they are not feeling well.</p>

</p>
<p>Four provinces have now confirmed cases of swine flu -- bringing Canada's total to 13 -- but results of possible cases in Saskatchewan have so far all come back negative.</p>
<p>However, the province had 10 possible cases "under investigation" as of Tuesday evening, including four in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region, the Ministry of Health said.</p>
<p>"We are reacting to this pandemic threat seriously. However, we reiterate that it may just burn itself out. It may be a mild pandemic," said Saskatchewan's chief medical officer of health Dr. Moira McKinnon at a news conference.</p>
<p>"We just don't know what this virus is going to do. We are asking people to be aware, but not to panic, not to be alarmed at all the activity that's going on."</p>
<p>McKinnon initially told reporters Tuesday that the province would no longer specify how many cases are under investigation here because it was creating confusion about Canada's tally of confirmed cases.</p>
<p>She also said the situation is "fluid," meaning the number of cases under investigation changes as some test results come back negative and other new potential cases arise.</p>
<p>Jurisdictions across the country had all agreed Tuesday morning they would report on the confirmed numbers only, she said.</p>
<p>However, the Saskatchewan ministry reversed that decision a few hours later, and announced that any confirmed cases that arise -- as well as the number of cases under investigation -- will be updated daily at 11 a.m. at www.health.gov.sk.ca[http://www.health.gov.sk.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca]. The 10 cases currently being investigated also involve the Cypress, Five Hills, Heartland, Prince Albert Parkland and Prairie North health regions.</p>
<p>So far, confirmed Canadian swine flu cases include three in B.C., two in Alberta, four in Ontario and four in Nova Scotia involving people who had traveled to Mexico.</p>
<p>The cases outside of Mexico, where the virus is suspected in about 150 deaths, have been described as mild.</p>
<p>The spreading swine flu prompted the World Health Organization to raise its pandemic alert on Monday from level three to four on its six-level scale, but the agency noted that doesn't mean a pandemic is inevitable.</p>
<p>A travel advisory was also issued Monday by Canada advising people to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>McKinnon said possible swine flu cases involve people who develop flu symptoms within seven days of returning from Mexico, instead of the 10-day time frame health officials were initially following, or people who are in contact with others who currently have the illness.</p>
<p>But McKinnon emphasized that Saskatchewan residents should not worry about being near people who have recently returned from Mexico if those people are not showing influenza symptoms.</p>
<p>Prescriptions for anti-virals, for which the province will foot the cost, will be provided to treat residents who fall ill, McKinnon said. Some pharmacies already have some of the medicine in stock, while the ministry also has a stockpile that it will be distributing, she said.</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's preparedness plans are also in gear, said Dr. Maurice Hennink, deputy medical health officer.</p>
<p>The region had by Monday set up its own emergency operations centre to monitor the situation, keep information flowing across the region and stay in contact provincial officials, Hennink said.</p>
<p>Emergency rooms and staff have also been advised on what to look for to detect the illness, he added.</p>
<p>But routine business of the health region is continuing as it normally would, Hennink said.</p>
<p>"As the situation unfolds, one will constantly monitor that."</p>
<p>He urged members of the public to practice good "respiratory etiquette" when it comes to coughing and sneezing and to regularly wash their hands as flu prevention measures.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan residents are being encouraged to call the HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002 if they have concerns.</p>

<p>Experts baffled by the conflicting evidence around a new swine flu are hoping a Canadian epidemiologist and other medical detectives on the ground in Mexico can shed more light on the mysterious virus, and help predict what shape it might yet take around the world.</p>
<p>With questions growing about the bug's virulence, death rate and other basic characteristics, the World Health Organization promised yesterday to convene a meeting of world scientists today to discuss what they know of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>It comes amid news of seven more confirmed swine flu cases in Canada, and comments by one public-health official that all 13 Canadian cases are more mild even than the regular seasonal flu.</p>
<p>That assessment contrasts starkly with the growing death toll and acute illnesses that Mexican officials have blamed on the same microbe, although few of its cases have actually been confirmed by lab tests, and Mexico has no capacity even to conduct tests itself.</p>
<p>Regardless, it is impossible to predict how the virus might spread in Canada without knowing more about it, said Dr. Vivek Goel, chief executive</p>
<p>of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>"A model is only as good as the data that goes into it and at this point we're still trying to get the data on the outbreak in Mexico," he told a news briefing. "Everyone around the world is waiting on that."</p>
<p>Ontario reported four lab-confirmed cases yesterday, two in Alberta and one in British Columbia, bringing the national total to 13, all involving people who had recently travelled to Mexico or live with someone who had.</p>
<p>News of the outbreak of a new swine flu, which actually contains the genetics of pig, bird and human viruses, emerged this month from Mexico with alarming statistics about its impact. The country has attributed about 1,900 cases and 150 deaths to the novel flu.</p>
<p>Yet the 68 cases identified in the United States, 13 now in Canada and 17 elsewhere in the world are mostly moderate ones, with few patients even ending up in hospital.</p>
<p>Some experts speculate that Mexico may itself have had tens of thousands of unreported mild cases of the virus, making the number of more severe infections and deaths seem less intimidating.</p>
<p>In fact, only 26 Mexican cases have been confirmed -- by labs in Canada and the United States -- as the new swine flu. Mexico does not have the ability to test for the virus, although a Public Health Agency of Canada scientist and others are there now to help build up its capacity, said Dr. Frank Plummer, medical director of the agency's microbiology labs in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>An epidemiologist with the agency is also in the country to help investigate the microbe's transmissibility, virulence and other attributes.</p>
<p>"There is much more unknown about this than there is known," Dr. Plummer told a news briefing in Ottawa.</p>
<p>One complicating factor is that regular human flu is also circulating in Mexico, noted Dr. David Butler-Jones, the agency's head.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization promised yesterday to compile a review of findings by various scientists investigating the outbreak, in response to "requests from the scientific community for more detailed scientific information on swine influenza."</p>
<p>The WHO and other experts in Mexico now are looking at the demographic profile and circumstances of patients, why certain people got sicker than others and the biological makeup of the virus, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the organization's chief official on the swine flu situation.</p>
<p>Dr. Fukuda cautioned that the relatively benign nature of the virus outside of Mexico could yet change, noting that the infamous 1918 pandemic started at this time of year with relatively mild cases, then turned deadly later, eventually killing about 50 million people worldwide.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer, said the "very mild" strain developing in Canada so far is less serious even than the influenza-A that hits every fall and winter.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Kamran Kahn, an infectious disease specialist at Toronto's St. Michael's Hospital, said research that he and colleagues recently completed for the public-health agency -- called the Bio-diaspora Project -- found that Mexico is one of the 13 places around the world most likely to introduce infectious disease to Canada.</p>
<p>His assessment was based on such factors as population size, the volume of air traffic into Canada, and the ability of the country's health-care system to respond to outbreaks. The findings mean that Canada should step up its efforts to help those countries deal with their health challenges, said Dr. Khan.</p>

<p>'Calls have been flying furiously back and forth," I'm told, between Toronto's party-ready-ier ladies.</p>
<p>The quandary? To go short or to go long? For Thursday's Innovators' Ball, that is. File under: One of the More Anticipated Shindigs of the Year.</p>
<p>"People are really taking the 'Femme Fatale' theme very seriously," one who would know tells me. Many are even going out and getting professionally styled to bring out their inner</p>
<p>MataHari!</p>
<p>So, what are you wearing, par exemple? I had to ask. My social-circle spy spills this: "I am wearing Izzy Camilleri or <span class="companylink">Louis Vuitton</span>. I bought two dresses, just in case." What she wears will depend on "what kind of mood" she's in!</p>
<p>Ah, yes, the whole "mood" thing.</p>
<p>Either she'll go for the vampish, dark dress with '30s coif to match. Or she'll go with the siren-red one with shades of RitaHayworth.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is one person who has zeroed things down to one dress. She's committed. She knows. That would be Mrs. Ben Mulroney, Jessica Brownstein. Together, the young A-couple are cochairing this year's benefit for the Ontario Science Centre. And, on this night, expect her to be in "Max Azria runway" -- paired with shoes from Browns (that latter part was easy: Her family founded the company).</p>
<p>Jessica says she's shaking up the classic femme fatale look by going for something with a more "nouveau vintage feel." She adds, seductively, "It's time for party guests to throw caution to the wind."</p>
<p>A few -- very few -- tickets remain for the LG Innovators' Ball, by the way. The dinner's sold out. See ontariosciencecentre.ca for deets!</p>
<p>Scene! Heard!</p>
<p>This! That! - CNN lothario John Roberts had a hankering the other day for good, old-fashioned Canadian candy bars. "Coffee Crisp ..." he tweeted. "Yum." - Hilary Duff, who's dating bona fide Canadian hockey player Mike Comrie, tells JustJared.com that she's no good with <span class="companylink">Google</span>--her boyfriend often has to search things for her!</p>
<p>That! This! - Howie Mandel, who's a germa-phobe at the best of times, has gone "super-extra-nutso," I'm told, about the current swine flu scenario. All the more fodder, I guess, for his book</p>
<p>coming out in December. It's called Here's the Deal -- Don't Touch Me! - The always-game Tie Domi was at Le Petit Castor the other night celebrating, he said, the closing of a "really big deal." - Margaret Atwood seen bearing La Boheme at the Four Seasons Centre on Saturday night. Did you know it comes with three intermissions?</p>

<p>A mutant superhero is no match for the swine flu that has killed up to 152 people in Mexico. Hollywood movie studio 20th Century Fox said on Monday it was scrapping plans to release X-Men Origins: Wolverine in Mexico this weekend. Jackman, pictured, was to have attended the film's premiere in Mexico City, but that plan has now been abandoned, with a studio representative citing safety concerns: "We were not only concerned about Hugh's welfare -- and we would never send anyone into harm's way -- but we also have an enormous office filled with people we care about." Wolverine is still on schedule to open virtually everywhere else in the world this weekend.</p>

<p>For the second day in a row, swine flu fears pulled down Canada's main exchange.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index lost 46.77 points or 0.5% to 9348.03, with losers outpacing gainers almost two-to-one and seven of 10 subindices closing in negative territory. The TSX venture exchange was also down, losing 9.88 points or 1% to 993.10. The Canadian dollar closed at US81.93¢, down seven basis points.</p>
<p>"Most of us didn't know what swine flu was four days ago," said Adrian Mastracci, portfolio manager with KCM Wealth Management. "And now all of sudden, investors have one more worry to consider at a time when it is already difficult to gauge where markets and the economy are headed."</p>
<p>In Toronto, travel-related stocks continued to suffer. Air Canada was down 1.25%, <span class="companylink">Transat A. T. Inc</span>. lost 1.3% and <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. was unchanged.</p>
<p>Concern that a global outbreak of swine flu will delay an economic recovery has also impacted the price of commodities over the past two days. During yesterday's session, energy stocks fell 0.9% as oil prices dropped to US$49.92 a barrel, down 22¢.</p>
<p>Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>. (EKO/TSX) was one beneficiary of the swine flu fear, rising another 2.5%. The company, which makes air filters and face masks, has risen almost 50% over the past two days.</p>

</p>
<p>Swine-flu deaths may be expected in B.C., a top health official said for the first time yesterday.</p>
<p>"I expect there may be hospitalizations and deaths," said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, flu expert at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Skowronski said officials are trying to determine the scope of the outbreak in B.C., where only three mild cases have so far been identified.</p>
<p>The virus has now infected 13 Canadians in four provinces. Seven new cases were confirmed yesterday -- two in Alberta, four in Ontario and one in B.C.</p>
<p>More than 150 people are believed to have died from swine flu in Mexico, and more than 1,600 are ill.</p>
<p>The United States now has at least 64 confirmed cases in five states. Ten cases are in California, which yesterday declared a state of emergency. Authorities in Los Angeles are also investigating what may be the first American death from swine flu.</p>
<p>"How big could it be? That's the million-dollar question," Skowronski said. "Numerous reports are being investigated. Officials need time to work through their investigation."</p>
<p>She said the disease does not seem to move easily from person to person.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence of sustained transmission, although we have had clusters of cases in other places," she said. "We have certainly not seen transmissions that would lead us to close shopping malls."</p>
<p>Skowronski said the province's emergency plan is "as good as anywhere in the world," but she conceded B.C. can "never be 100-per-cent prepared for a prolonged crisis."</p>
<p>She advises anyone experiencing coughing and flu symptoms to stay home for seven days.</p>
<p>"This is a time for everyone to work together. Please don't expose others," she said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the B.C. Nurses Union said the province "might not be prepared as much as it needs to be."</p>
<p>"Hospitals are full and they are putting patients in hallways. B.C. is also short of nurses," said Margaret Dhillon, the nurses' executive councillor for health and safety.</p>
<p>B.C.'s emergency plans call for 10 weeks' supply of N95 facemasks, described by one health professional as the "Cadillac" of all masks. They would be given to health-care workers treating confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Increasing numbers of requests for the masks are being received by Metro Vancouver drug stores.</p>
<p>"We are increasing our inventory of masks. Most stores should have them in the next day or so," said John Tse, London Drugs vice-president of pharmacy. The masks sell for $7 for a package of two.</p>
<p>Tse said customers are also asking for other germ-fighting aids such as portable hand-sanitizers.</p>

</p>
<p>A 30-year-old Victoria woman who recently returned home from a Mexican holiday is Vancouver Island's first confirmed case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Michelle Bossi is recovering at home. "I'm fine," she said yesterday after learning that her test results had been confirmed by the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>But she's upset that doctors at Victoria's Royal Jubilee Hospital first told her she wasn't contagious and sent her home.</p>
<p>"I'm annoyed I could have affected other people," she said.</p>
<p>Bossi and a female Victoria friend became sick last Thursday, while staying at a resort in Cancun, on Mexico's east coast.</p>
<p>Both women became so sick they had trouble getting out of bed the next day.</p>
<p>After being examined by a hotel doctor, they were advised to go to the local hospital. There, they were given an IV, an X-ray, medication and a mask. Bossi said they were told they had bronchitis and were advised to remain in the hospital.</p>
<p>But the women decided to fly home early Saturday with the rest of their charter Sunwing flight.</p>
<p>"I heard a lot of people coughing, an abnormal amount," Bossi said.</p>
<p>They wore masks on the flight and on the bus and ferry ride back to Victoria.</p>
<p>Her mother took her straight to Royal Jubilee's emergency department, where, after a 60-minute wait, she explained she had just been in Mexico and was really sick. She raised the possibility of swine flu.</p>
<p>Bossi says she was placed in isolation and after several hours was given an IV and medication to help reduce her fever. She had blood, nasal and sputum tests, and an X-ray.</p>
<p>Around midnight, Bossi said, she was told she did not have the flu, was not contagious and could go home.</p>
<p>Late Sunday afternoon, she received a call from someone she understood was from the Vancouver Island Health Authority, saying swine flu was a possibility. By that time, her boyfriend and mother were taking care of her. Bossi was told to stay home for a week, avoid people and monitor her symptoms.</p>
<p>Bossi believes her Cancun travel-mate is doing better than herself but has not recently talked with her.</p>

<p>The Canadian Tour is rescheduling two golf tournaments in Mexico due to health concerns surrounding recent reports of Swine Flu.</p>
<p>The IDN Yucatan Country Club Classic was scheduled for May 7 and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open was scheduled to begin May 14. Both have been cancelled and will be played on consecutive weeks at a later date that has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>"With the heightened alerts in Mexico, we have taken the precaution of protecting the health and safety of our members," said tour commissioner Richard Janes in a press release on Tuesday. "The Canadian Tour is making the necessary arrangements with its travel partners to bring our players home."</p>
<p>The San Luis Potosi Open, which begins Thursday at the Nicklaus La Loma golf course in San Luis Potosi, is going ahead as scheduled.</p>
<p>Players are already on location and have conferred with Tour officials on the decision to go ahead with the tournament.</p>
<p>Restricted access to the course and a number of health and sanitary measures have been enacted by Canadian Tour officials to protect players from exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>"We are taking every precaution with our players at San Luis Potosi and will watch the situation closely," Janes said in a press release on Monday. "While we have seen 10 to 15 players withdraw, our players are all independent contractors and many are still arriving from Latin America, the United States and Canada, all eager to play."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada released a statement on Monday asking that travellers from Canada should "postpone elective or non-essential" journeys to Mexico.</p>

<p>Three people in Windsor and Essex County have been tested for the swine flu but so far there are no confirmed local cases linked to the outbreak.</p>
<p>"We have three individuals who have been swabbed over the last couple days, but none of the individuals are in hospital. None of the individuals have serious flu-like symptoms," Windsor-Essex Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Heimann said one of the three is a temporary worker from Mexico but has been in the area for some time and the case was not suspected to be swine flu.</p>
<p>"It was done as a precaution," Heimann said.</p>
<p>The test results can take 48 to 72 hours.</p>
<p>Health officials announced Tuesday that four cases of swine flu had been confirmed in Ontario in the Toronto area involving travellers to Mexico. Those cases were described as mild and didn't require hospitalization.</p>
<p>That brings the cases in Canada to 13, with two new cases confirmed in Alberta and one in British Columbia Tuesday. Leamington has thousands of agricultural workers who travel from Mexico each year.</p>
<p>The greenhouse workers arrive in January and February and haven't likely been back to Mexico.</p>
<p>More workers will come in the summer as fruit and vegetables are ready for harvest.</p>
<p>Heimann said the greenhouse workers from Mexico who have been here for months are no different than residents who have not travelled to Mexico recently. "It's people who are coming back from Mexico that we are concerned about," he said.</p>
<p>Seasonal agricultural workers from Mexico are being screened with a questionnaire and a physical examination.</p>
<p>On Monday, 75 workers were examined in Mexico City and four were left behind, said Citizenship and Immigration Canada spokeswoman Danielle Norris Tuesday. Another 150 workers heading to Canada were to be screened Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The program continues and we are taking extra steps to ensure the people who get on the plane aren't showing any symptoms," she said.</p>
<p>Leamington Mayor John Adams, a farmer, said he was confident in the testing.</p>
<p>"If all the proper precautions have taken place, the odds of anybody catching the swine flu in Leamington from the migrant workers is one out of a million," Adams said.</p>
<p>He estimates the Leamington area gets about 5,000 workers a year with about 4,000 from Mexico and about 1,000 from the Caribbean. He estimated about 3,500 migrant workers are already in the area.</p>
<p>The Migrant Worker Community Program in Leamington sent out information about swine flu in Spanish and English Monday that employers could post.</p>
<p>Charlene Houle, the program's general manager, said she's not worried about swine flu in Leamington. The program, which acts as a cultural link between residents and the workers, is going ahead with its annual Cinco de Mayo festival Sunday at the local legion. She said the 3 to 6 p.m. festival usually attracts a few hundred people.</p>
<p>Leamington District Memorial Hospital is asking emergency room patients questions, such as whether they have travelled recently to Mexico, in an effort to screen for the flu.</p>
<p>Recent travellers to Mexico or the United States who are experiencing respiratory illness are asked to call their doctor.</p>
<p>Symptoms include high fever, a headache, cough, fatigue and a sore throat.</p>
<p>Health officials are advising people to cough and sneeze in their arms or sleeve, not hands, to wash their hands regularly and to stay home if they are sick.</p>

</p>
<p>Information that 4,000 farm workers from Mexico arrived in Ontario in January and February to work in greenhouses in the Leamington and Simcoe areas was misattributed to federal immigration minister Jason Kenney. 20090605</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government is seriously considering warning Canadians against travel to Mexico, but stopped short of issuing an advisory yesterday despite a deadly outbreak of swine flu that has killed about 150 people there.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones said telling Canadians to stay away from a certain area of the world is a complicated decision.</p>
<p>"Every decision has consequences: good effects and bad effects," Butler-Jones told a news conference in Ottawa. "If you issue a travel advisory, not only are you impacting on a theoretical risk of exposure, but also the impacts of people not travelling, what that does economically, etc., which then has health impacts."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has been distributing health advice to travellers through its website, inflight announcements and on posters that went up at airports and border crossings today. The advice urges everyone going to and from Mexico to cover coughs and sneezes, get flu shots, wash hands regularly and seek medical attention if flu-like symptoms develop.</p>
<p>Federal officials said yesterday Canada knew of a case of swine flu in Mexico at the beginning of April but did not know it was a new strain or that it would spread as it has.</p>
<p>"It was rather an isolated event," said Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director general of the National Microbiology Laboratory.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said the government has a six-point plan to deal with the threat, including: monitoring flu cases, international co-operation, research on vaccine development, stockpiles of antiviral medication, health services, and communications.</p>
<p>Canadian border officials are ready to quarantine anyone with suspicious symptoms.</p>
<p>Canadian Citizenship and Immigration also set up a pre-departure screening process in Mexico City to help ensure Mexican temporary foreign workers headed to farms across Canada would not bring swine flu with them.</p>
<p>Those workers must now fill out a questionnaire, undergo a physical exam and have their temperatures taken by two doctors before collecting their permits, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said.</p>
<p>About 4,000 farm workers from Mexico arrived in Ontario in January and February to work in greenhouses in the Leamington and Simcoe areas, he said. So far, there have been no signs of swine flu infection.</p>
<p>Another 15,000 Mexicans destined for outside farm work, mostly in Ontario, begin arriving in weekly planeloads at the end of this week.</p>

<p>(PUBLISHED APRIL 30, 2009, PAGE A18) Cartoon meant no offence to Mexico: Aislin's Tuesday cartoon, about tourists returning from Mexico, evoked some irate comments from readers. Here is the cartoonist's response:</p>
<p>I'm a little puzzled by readers' concern over Tuesday's cartoon.</p>
<p>We Canadians (myself included) travel a great deal to Mexico, often returning with souvenir T-shirts and silly sombreros we never wear again.</p>
<p>But now returning tourists (as pictured all week in the news) might be carrying a deadly virus, too. This is a serious, far-reaching problem. The cartoon says exactly that.</p>
<p>The imagery of the skull apparently bothered some readers. But the skull is a very common symbol in Mexican graphic art, and not considered to be anywhere near as threatening as it is in our culture.</p>
<p>It was a famous Mexican cartoonist named Posada who popularized the skull, in connection with the Day of the Dead, at the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>I personally know many contemporary Mexican cartoonists working in Mexico City who use the symbol frequently.</p>

</div><div>Andrew Mayeda and Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1040 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>(From The Edmonton Journal, April 30, 2009) Australia has not issued an alert to its citizens to restrict travel to countries where cases of swine flu have been confirmed, including Canada. Erroneous information was contained in a Canwest News story published Tuesday.***** </p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level Monday amid a worldwide battle against the swine flu outbreak, while Canadian health officials warned to expect more cases and likely some deaths in Canada.</p>
<p>As cases were confirmed for the first time in Spain and Scotland, the WHO raised its pandemic alert phase from three to four on a scale of one to six. It's the first time the pandemic alert has reached that level since the world health agency created the system in 2005.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, WHO officials cautioned a flu pandemic is not "inevitable."</p>
<p>"What this can really be interpreted as is a significant step towards pandemic influenza, but also it is a phase which says that we are not there yet," said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of health security at the WHO. "We think that we have taken a step in that direction but a pandemic is not considered inevitable at this time."</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of confirmed cases remained at six Monday: four in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia. Symptoms in the Canadian cases have been milder than those in Mexico, where 20 deaths have been confirmed.</p>
<p>However, Canadian health officials warned the public the worst could be yet to come.</p>
<p>"Simply because we're seeing mild symptoms so far does not mean we can take this for granted. We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illnesses and we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well," David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"We hope not. But that is a normal part of an influenza outbreak of any type."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canada began implementing its national flu-pandemic plan, with officials stepping up surveillance for flu cases and government scientists rushing to develop a vaccine.</p>
<p>The federal government also took additional steps to protect travellers and "has issued a health-alert notice to the airlines that they are now distributing," Aglukkaq said in a release Monday night.</p>
<p>"In addition, airlines are making onboard announcements to advise travellers of health precautions."</p>
<p>Seasonal workers travelling to Canada from Mexico, many of whom work in agriculture during the summer, must now receive a physical exam and be tested for fever before they depart.</p>
<p>Washington declared a public health emergency and warned Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>But Canadian officials were still weighing whether to follow the U.S. and issue a travel advisory against Mexico.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, countries such as India, Australia and Malaysia cautioned their citizens to restrict travel to countries where cases have been confirmed, including Canada.</p>
<p>The moves drew a harsh rebuke from federal officials.</p>
<p>"Different countries apply their own approaches . . . and one of the challenges is avoiding the knee-jerk reactions. One of the things you want to avoid is actually making problems worse," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan called the travel advisories against Canada an "overreaction."</p>
<p>"I think that countries should be prudent in only taking that step if there is clear evidence of a very real danger and risk," he told reporters.</p>
<p>In Mexico, where the outbreak is believed to have originated earlier this month, there are 20 confirmed deaths, and officials estimate the toll could rise to 149. More than 700 people are being treated in hospital for serious respiratory illnesses and 1,070 have been discharged.</p>
<p>There are 40 confirmed cases in the United States, all mild, in five states -- New York, Ohio, Kansas, Texas and California. There are 26 confirmed cases in Mexico, one in Spain and two in Scotland.</p>
<p>In its briefing Monday, the WHO said it's too late to try and contain the virus, so countries should focus on mitigation measures. Those measures, however, do not include closing borders or restricting travel.</p>
<p>On the WHO's alert scale, level six is considered a pandemic. At level three, limited human-to-human transmission of the virus may occur, but the strain is not believed to be contagious enough to cause a pandemic. At level four, the strain has moved beyond causing outbreaks among small clusters of people to triggering "community-level outbreaks," thus increasing the risk of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Swine flu is common among pigs, but sometimes spreads to humans. Scientists are still researching the nature of the new strain. They say it is notable because it is killing people aged 20 to 50, not the young and elderly, who are typically the most susceptible.</p>
<p>The flu affects millions of Canadians each year, resulting in 20,000 admissions to hospital, on average, and 4,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Normally, fewer than 0.1 per cent of people with influenza die, if they have no underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>SWINE FLU FACTS</p>
<p>- What is human swine flu?</p>
<p>Symptoms are similar to those of the normal seasonal flu, including fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, coughing and sore throat. Some people with swine flu have also reported vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>- How does it spread?</p>
<p>Health officials believe it is passing from human to human when an infected person coughs or sneezes and someone breathes in the particles, or when someone touches a surface with flu particles and then touches their mouth.</p>
<p>- How serious is the outbreak?</p>
<p>It is too early to say if the outbreak will develop into a pandemic, which occurs three or four times a century, spreads quickly among humans and covers a wide geographic area.</p>
<p>- How can I protect myself?</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency recommends washing hands thoroughly, or using hand sanitizer. It also suggests staying home if sick, and checking www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca] for alerts and www.voyage.gc.ca[http://www.voyage.gc.ca] for travel advisories. See a doctor if you have severe flu-like symptoms.</p>

<p>With cases confirmed yesterday in Spain and Scotland, the WHO raised its pandemic alert phase to four from three, on a scale with six as the most severe.</p>
<p>It's the first time the pandemic alert has reached four since the world health agency created the system in 2005. "What this can really be interpreted as is a significant step towards pandemic influenza but also it is a phase which says that we are not there yet. In other words, at this time we think that we have taken a step in that direction but a pandemic is not considered inevitable at this time," said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of health security at the WHO.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of confirmed cases remained at six yesterday: four in Nova Scotia and two in B.C.</p>
<p>Symptoms in the Canadian cases have been milder than those in Mexico, where 149 deaths have been blamed on the swine flu.</p>
<p>Richmond resident Ryan Windsor said he's one of the two cases in B.C.</p>
<p>On the last day of his Mexican vacation, Windsor was tired and light-headed, and thought he had heat stroke. On the plane home the next day, "I was freezing cold. I was wrapped in two blankets and flight attendants gave me hot chocolate and hot water bottles."</p>
<p>Windsor, 26, said he flew to Cancun on April 14 with a friend, and enjoyed the sunshine and beach vacation he had anticipated, but began feeling sick before his return flight last Wednesday. When he got home, he spent the next two days bedridden with all the symptoms of the common flu, only magnified.</p>
<p>He described swine flu as like the worse case of food poisoning imaginable, but lasting four days instead of 24 hours. "It's the sickest I've been," he said.</p>
<p>By Friday morning, with his symptoms persisting, Windsor was quarantined in Richmond Hospital for testing. Blood was drawn and chest X-rays were taken. He was sent home the same day and told to stay there and wear a mask.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Windsor said, he received a call from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control confirming he had swine flu, after his blood was sent to California for testing.</p>
<p>"We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illnesses and we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well," Canadian Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones told reporters in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Canadian officials have started giving swine-flu alerts to travellers departing for or returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>Seasonal workers arriving in Canada from Mexico, many of whom work in the agricultural sector during the summer, must now receive a physical exam, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said.</p>
<p>Washington warned Americans to avoid travel to Mexico. Canadian officials are still weighing whether to follow the U.S. advisory against Mexico.</p>
<p>Countries such as India, Australia and Malaysia have cautioned their citizens to restrict travel to countries where cases have been confirmed, including Canada. Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan called the travel advisories against Canada an overreaction.</p>

<p>Despite assurances from Montreal health officials, there's a whiff of panic in the street - pharmacies emptying of face masks and travellers are stockpiling medication.</p>
<p>At least two cases of suspected swine flu are under observation in Montreal and one in the Mauricie region, according Dominique Breton of the Quebec Health Department.</p>
<p>All North American cases, including six confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada, have been relatively mild and people have recovered or are recovering, said Terry Nan Tannenbaum, head of Montreal's Public Health Department.</p>
<p>Mexican health officials yesterday raised the suspected death toll from the outbreak to 149. But the severe illnesses and swine flu deaths sweeping Mexico have not translated to other countries, Tannenbaum said.</p>
<p>"We're not seeing that here. Be reassured that the cases are very mild," Tannenbaum said. "We're on very high alert. It's a new virus and it's being followed closely. We are releasing the information as we get it."</p>
<p>Tannenbaum cautioned against buying antiviral medication because the federal government already stocks medication.</p>
<p>"But it's not clear yet who should be treated and what medications are best," she said. "Stockpiling medication has never been recommended."</p>
<p>But that's precisely what is happening at some private clinics.</p>
<p>At Medisys travel health clinic, which gets an average of 200 patients a day for travel vaccination and other medication, "everyone coming in is asking for a prescription" of the antiviral Tamiflu regardless of their destination, said medical director Dominique Tessier. "We gave it out all day."</p>
<p>Pandemic fears are rising as new cases appear in new locations.</p>
<p>For Jocelyn Tremblay, manager of an east-end clothing store, all travel to and from Mexico should be banned because it's the epicentre of the outbreak.</p>
<p>"The federal government is asleep at the switch. If I had a plane ticket to Mexico, I wouldn't go. It's the source of the infection. And it's virulent," he said. "In people who are hard hit - the medication doesn't work."</p>
<p>Canada is well prepared to deal with a pandemic, said Brian Ward, chief of McGill University's division of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>"Healthy young adults have died and that's a scary thing," Ward said. Experts do not know why the same strain of swine flu is killing Mexicans, but shows up relatively mild elsewhere, he added.</p>
<p>"It's a mystery as to what is going on in Mexico," he said. "But there is no reason to panic (here)."</p>
<p>Hospitals have implemented ER pre-triage patient screening at the door. Anyone travelling in Mexico - and the people they've with been in contact with - that present with flu-like symptoms, will be given masks and placed in separate quarters and tested for swine flu, said Lucie Dufresne of Centre hospitalier de l'Université de Montréal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Laval University yesterday imposed a moratorium on travel to Mexico, California and Texas for its students as a preventive measure. About 30 students saw their spring training postponed. Another four Laval students already in Mexico have reported no illnesses.</p>
