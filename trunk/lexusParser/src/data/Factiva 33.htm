<p>Colorado Avalanche coach Joe Sacco confirmed on Tuesday morning practice that ailing goalie peter Budaj is a victim of the swine flu.</p>
<p>Budaj was supposed to start for the Avs last Friday night against the Carolina Hurricanes in Denver, but was scratched. Doctors determined he had the H1n1 virus.</p>
<p>"We've taken the necessary steps and precautions to keep him from the guys," said Sacco, who indicated Budaj, the Avs' backup goalie, could rejoin the club some time on their four-game road trip.</p>
<p>They play in Calgary tonight, in San Jose on Friday, and in Vancouver on Sunday.</p>

<p>Edmonton Oilers defenceman Ladislav Smid has been playing with the H1N1 flu virus, commonly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Smid had a fever between games 10 days ago and missed a practice, but didn't miss any games, logging almost 20 minutes in Tuesday's 3-0 loss to the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>The test results didn't come back until Tuesday, by which time Smid was feeling bettter.</p>
<p>He was well enough to soldierethrough the games, unlike Ales Hemsky, Mike Comrie and Gilbert Brule, who missed one, two and three games, respectively, with flu-like symptoms. Brule returned Sunday in Vancouver, Comrie against the Colorado Avalanche Tuesday. Hemsky sat out an Oct. 16 game against Minnesota.</p>
<p>"There's a five-day window to get the results," said Oilers coach Pat Quinn, who has seen a platoon of his players get sick. Defenceman Lubomir Visnovsky left Tuesday's game after a couple of shifts in the third period. Visnovsky sits beside Smid, his defence partner, in the dressing room.</p>
<p>"People in the community will be affected by this flu and our players are not immune to this new virus," said team doctor Dhiren Naidu.</p>
<p>"It's important to note that our player recovered in very short order, and has since resumed playing.</p>
<p>We continue to be diligent in our defences aginst the virus and encourage everyone to do the same."</p>

<p>AVALANCHE AT OILERS</p>

<p>EDMONTON 0 0 0 -- 0</p>
<p>GAME STAR</p>
<p>COLORADO</p>
<p>Wojtek Wolski</p>
<p>He had two goals in the third period, including one that was awarded when hooked by Taylor Chorney on a breakaway with Oilers goalie nikolai Khabibulin pulled for an extra attacker.</p>
<p>SCRATCHES</p>
<p>AVALAnCHe--Darcy Tucker (concussion), peter Budaj (swine flu) matt Hendricks (groin), T.J. Hensick. OiLerS--Sheldon Souray and Steve Staios (concussions), marc pouliot (hernia), Fernando pisani (back) ryan Stone (knee), Steve macintyre, Theo peckham,</p>
<p>WHY OILERS LOST</p>
<p>Because they played like the whole team had the flu, and the Avs might be the fastest skating team in the league, with a terrific transition game and wonderful puck support. Almost no energy from the Oilers, who have now gone seven periods without a goal.</p>
<p>TURNING POINT</p>
<p>With the Avs up 1-0 midway through the second, the Oilers had a five-on-three for 17 seconds and then a single power play right afterward, but had only two shots on Craig Anderson. They miss Sheldon Souray's big bomb to give opposing goalies a fright.</p>

</p>
<p>While Peter Budaj recovers in Denver from the swine flu, Craig Anderson has been on fire.</p>
<p>Anderson has been one of the hottest NHL goalies in the season's first month, playing every minute of the Colorado Avalanche's 12 games, proving that stopping pucks is the only position where teams don't write you off the older you get.</p>
<p>Anderson, the league's best free-agent signing at a salary-cap hit of $1.8 million US over two years, has patiently bided his time to be the go-to guy in net. He was originally drafted by Calgary in 1999, but the Flames didn't sign him and he went back into the draft in 2001, when the Chicago Blackhawks took him. He was on waivers three times in less than three weeks in 2006 and belonged to the Boston Bruins, Chicago, the St. Louis Blues and Florida Panthers in a six-month span.</p>
<p>He lived in Sweden and inserted a double-s in the middle of his surname to to fit in. When he played for the Blackhawks, he had an incorrect spelling on the name bar of his jersey until the NHL, as he says, "questioned the legality of it."</p>
<p>He has never played more than 31 games in a season, but he might play 60 or more this year. He's been so good, the folks picking Team USA for the 2010 Olympics have had their eyes opened wide. He wasn't at their summer camp but he's in the picture now, with Ryan Miller, Tim Thomas and Jonathan Quick.</p>
<p>He has sparkled for Colorado, heading into Tuesday's contest with a 2.14 goals-against average and a .936 save percentage while facing an average of 34 shots a game.</p>
<p>"I don't think you're ever too old to be a (starting NHL) goalie ... when you think about it, there's only 30 spots and sometimes you might have to wait and sit on the bench for five or six years," said Anderson.</p>
<p>"All I know is, when you get the opportunity, you'd better make the most of it before some other kid takes that opportunity from you ... the advantage when you're older is you hopefully know more about the game. You learn tendencies of shooters, not to do too much, just worry about doing the job you're supposed to do, not everybody else's. Once you figure that out, the game gets easier."</p>
<p>Anderson had no problem with his lot in life in Florida, knowing Tomas Vokoun had paid more NHL dues and got more rope as a starter than the backup.</p>
<p>"You earn that ... you put together a couple of good seasons of 60 or 70 games, and that (respect) comes," Anderson said.</p>
<p>Same with the Olympic team snub. He wasn't upset that the U.S. Olympic squad passed on him for the camp in Chicago.</p>
<p>"Thomas and Miller are both really good starters, and Quick played 50 or so games last year in L.A. The ball's in their (U. S. Olympic management) court now. If I do my job, and they choose me to go along, that would great. If not, that's their decision," he said.</p>
<p>Anderson wasn't about to re-sign with the Florida Panthers, who are paying Vokoun $5.7 million a year, when he hit the free-agent market. He was good last year, with a 2.71 average, but the clock was ticking. Colorado called on the second day of free-agency.</p>
<p>"We had a few teams pegged that we wanted to talk to ... I wasn't afraid I wouldn't get an NHL job somewhere. I thought I could be a backup on all 30 teams, but it was great Colorado called. They wanted a guy to battle for the No. 1 job," he said.</p>
<p>Budaj had been a little maddening --often excellent, but with a tendency to give up a suspect goal--so the Avs took a shot on Anderson. He has carried them so far, even if many are waiting for the wheels to fall off this young hard-working team.</p>
<p>"We tighten the lug-nuts every day to make sure they're on tight," joked Anderson, who's riding the wave along with everybody else.</p>
<p>When the guys in front of the net-minder believe their puck-stopper is as good as the guy in the opposing net, it's a safety blanket. They know he's not going to give up a goal from the boards, or a floater with no screen. Anderson has been rock solid.</p>
<p>"If you're talking about a 28-year-old forward, if you make the NHL, then that's rare, but goalies take longer to establish themselves," said Colorado coach Joe Sacco. "Andy's in the prime of his career. He's got the opportunity and he's running with it. I think he's on a mission to be not just a No. 1 goalie, but one of the best (in the NHL)."</p>

</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, Pat Quinn lamented the fact that he had but one line that could score.</p>
<p>By Tuesday night, the Edmonton Oilers head coach wasn't even that fortunate.</p>
<p>No matter the speed at which he blends, no matter the healthy players he slaps together with those who have been sick or may even be getting sick, the duos and trios he combines in fits of desperation, he has not been able to squeeze a single goal out of this sickened lineup for seven periods now.</p>
<p>Oilers fans have traded early enthusiasm for recent worry with the team in an 0-3 spin. Though it's way too early to even look for the panic button, much less give it a whack, there is now an official medical reason to be concerned about the next couple of games at least.</p>
<p>The flu that has ravaged Quinn's team -- defenceman Ladislav Smid has been diagnosed as H1N1-positive but recovered quickly and didn't miss a game--is undeniably responsible for some of what we are seeing.</p>
<p>While only one case of H1N1 has been detected, illness has affected far more than one Oiler. Each time, energy levels are sapped and the recovery takes four or five days.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, Smid's defence partner Lubomir Visnovsky was out of energy in the latter stages of a 3-0 loss to the Colorado Avalanche, so it's a factor.</p>
<p>Even now, theirs isn't so much a dressing room as it is a germ exchange. Completely healthy Oilers are vastly out-numbered by those who are feeling a bug of some sort in varying degrees, or have emerged with varying amounts of strength.</p>
<p>Somehow, a few players like Andrew Cogliano, Jason Strudwick, Zack Stortini, Robert Nilsson and Sam Gagner have stayed out of harm's way.</p>
<p>"Garlic pills," Gagner said. "My dad hasn't had the sniffles for 15 years. I hope I didn't jinx it."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Mike Comrie was playing his first game since the bug beat the energy out of him so badly that he missed a couple of games on the weekend. He said on Tuesday morning that he was "good enough" to play.</p>
<p>Let's be honest, that's the kind of lineup Quinn has been forced to ice. Anybody feeling good enough to play, plays. "Like I said, we have four or five guys in by default," Quinn said about his patchwork lineup.</p>
<p>We're pretty sure he wasn't talking about the slumping Shawn Horcoff.</p>
<p>The Oilers are not using flu as an excuse for Tuesday's loss, or any other for that matter, and that's good because it cannot be the sole cause of their offensive drought.</p>
<p>Instead, Quinn must go in search of answers for a power play that has no power and five-on-five hockey that produces few chances. These are not suddenly last year's Oilers, true, but they are not the same team that made Rexall Place a much tougher place to play just a week ago.</p>
<p>"That's what we were tonight, a team that was ready to play easy," said Quinn.</p>
<p>The Oilers do not hit as much as they did even last week, and the offence that flowed so easily and quickly through nine games is a rumour.</p>
<p>Recent evidence to the contrary, this is a better offensive team than last year's edition, with a potent top line of scrappy Gagner centring the enigmatic Ales Hemsky and resurgent Dustin Penner.</p>
<p>But they have to start proving it again. Soon. After combining for 13 points in a comeback win over the Columbus Blue Jackets, they levelled off against the Calgary Flames and did just this side of nothing against the Vancouver Canucks.</p>
<p>They were invisible early and unlucky late against the Avalanche, too.</p>
<p>"As a first line, you're relied upon to score goals and create offence," said Gagner. "I feel like we're creating. It's just one of those things. It's never a good feeling to get shut out. Obviously, we've got to change something up."</p>
<p>Any line with Penner and Hemsky on it is now expected to lead the way on offence and they are suddenly failing. Making things worse is the fact nobody behind them is chipping in now.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, they would rely on whatever line Horcoff centres to provide a spark. Alas, his traditional early-season offensive struggles have yet to abate and he's no longer the de facto No. 1 centre. In facto, he's not even an offensive player. He has only two points.</p>
<p>Horcoff is clearly not delivering bang for the buck and worse, the depth chart jockeying that was inspired by his ridiculous slump has inspired Quinn's very own Catch-22. He put Gagner, Hemsky and Penner together because all he had at the time was one scoring line.</p>
<p>Horcoff and Hemsky were together, as always, and both struggling like crazy, which is somewhat less predictable.</p>
<p>Rather than ride it out, Quinn did what MacTavish generally speaking would not. He broke them up in an effort to spread the scoring around and try to get both of them going. Darn.</p>
<p>"We're trying to find the right guys for (Horcoff) to play with," Quinn said on Tuesday morning. "It is not a sole game. He had a lot of success with Ales before, but we tried to move it around, thinking we'd increase our flexibility. We can't play with one line.</p>
<p>"I said that coming in," Quinn continued. "Because of injury, because of a few things, we switched it around. Well, guess what. We ended up with one line again. We've got to fix that."</p>
<p>As of Tuesday night, it was either broken or at the very least suffering from the flu.</p>

</p>
<p>The sigh escaped quickly--much like the Edmonton Oilers grasp on their game.</p>
<p>"Frustrating. Disappointing. We really struggled all over," Patrick O'Sullivan said after Colorado Avalanche netminder Craig Anderson blocked 25 shots to fashion a 3-0 shutout on Tuesday at Rexall Place.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just scoring. It was everything we tried to do," O'Sullivan continued. "It didn't work. Mental mistakes. You name it."</p>
<p>Now winless in their last three games--and shut out in two straight -- the Oilers record has fallen to 6-5-1.</p>
<p>The energetic Avs, who jumped out to a 1-0 lead 25 seconds after the puck dropped, are 9-1-2.</p>
<p>"The way Colorado plays, they try and entice you with turnovers and we played right into their hands by trying to go through everybody," Sam Gagner said. "We have to get back to the drawing board.</p>
<p>"We have to get back to the way we were playing. It seemed everybody was chipping in, everybody was playing loose, but the last few games we've got too frustrated when it hasn't gone our way in the first period. We didn't even show up in the first period tonight ... It's just embarrassing to be shut out two games in a row."</p>
<p>The last time the Oilers were blanked in consecutive games was April 3 and 5, 2007, in a pair of 3-0 losses to the Minnesota Wild.</p>
<p>The Oilers are starting to look like the team that was easy prey last season. They were outshot 33-25 on Tuesday, the power play was 0-for-3 (after an 0-for-6 outing in Vancouver on Sunday), and they were consistently turning the puck over in the neutral zone.</p>
<p>"We have to come out harder," said Shawn Horcoff, who was on the ice for the fateful first shift.</p>
<p>Horcoff had the puck on the stick, defenceman Lubomir Visnovsky whacked at it, and seconds later, Milan Hejduk turned the game's first gaffe into a 1-0 lead.</p>
<p>Midway through the third period, Wojtek Wolski zipped up the wing and slipped the backbreaker past goaltender Nikolai Khabibulin, who did what he could to leave the door open for his struggling mates.</p>
<p>In the dying minutes of the contest, Wolski, racing towards an open net with the puck on his stick, was hooked by Taylor Chorney on the breakaway and awarded his second goal of the game.</p>
<p>"They got that goal so early," said head coach Pat Quinn. "We lost the opening faceoff ...and the next thing you know it was in our net.</p>
<p>"They got the one-goal lead, then went to the trap. We had lots of discussion about how to beat that, but we did not do it on a regular enough basis. They didn't care if they got another one. They were going to wait until we turned it over, and we did," Quinn continued. "We were on our heels for much of the night."</p>
<p>In an attempt to kickstart Horcoff, who has gone seven games without a point, Quinn put him between Patrick O'Sullivan and Mike Comrie, who had missed the previous two games with the flu.</p>
<p>Before the game was out, Visnovsky left because he was too sick too continue playing. His defensive partner, Ladislav Smid, was diagnosed as the team's first official H1N1 victim. Smid did not miss a game.</p>
<p>Others have managed to avoid the flu but not the cold hands.</p>
<p>Andrew Cogliano has gone six games without a point, while J.F. Jacques and Ethan Moreau have played eight games and nine games, respectively, without a goal.</p>
<p>"Everyone wants to contribute. Everyone wants to go out there and earn their money. I'm no different," said Horcoff. "In a lot of ways, that's my downfall. I let it bother me too much and then it becomes tough as each period, each game goes on.</p>
<p>"You have to focus on trying to contribute anyway you can."</p>

<p>The wave of germs that is keeping a growing number of Edmonton area students at home sick now appears to be thinning the ranks of staff at some schools.</p>
<p>In some cases, even substitutes being called to fill in for teachers away due to illness or professional development are declining work due to their own sickness.</p>
<p>In the search for 848 substitute teachers, custodial staff and school secretaries on Tuesday, 324 people on the Edmonton Public Schools supply list of about 2,000 reported they were sick, district spokeswoman Jane Sterling said. While many first-year teachers were away from school for training, the district reported it has 10 schools or departments in which more than 10 per cent of their staff were absent on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"Anybody on our supply list we've said, 'Please don't accept a position if you experience flu-like symptoms.'</p>
<p>"What we're trying to do is keep people with flu-like symptoms out of the schools. Many of our teachers in consulting services could be asked to go back into classrooms if this starts to grow, as all signs indicate it is going to."</p>
<p>As of mid-Tuesday afternoon, 36 public schools in Edmonton had at least 10 per cent of its students absent--10 more schools than on Monday. Edmonton Catholic Schools spokeswoman Lori Nagy said there is not necessarily a connection between the schools in that district with a high number of students absent and a higher number of sick staff. As of Tuesday morning, nine Catholic schools had a 10-to 15-percent absentee rate today, while another small school had 27 per cent of its students away.</p>
<p>"The school that has 27 per cent of the kids away have no staff away and neither does another school that has 10 per cent of the children absent since last Thursday," Nagy said. "We have one school that has 16 per cent of staff away and they've got 14 per cent of their kids away."</p>
<p>Districts are monitoring absentee rates carefully to help monitor the spread of H1N1 influenza in the community. When schools have more than one-tenth of their students absent, they must inform Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>Health officials said last week they are no longer testing at every school that has a 10-per-cent absentee rate. Many schools are asking for more detailed information than in previous years when a parent phones in an absence. Schools at all grade levels seem to be feeling the impact, officials from both Edmonton districts said.</p>
<p>"It started out being elementary students and now our high schools are really involved," Nagy said. "At the beginning, we noticed it was more on the south side. Now it's all over the city."</p>
<p>At St. Albert Catholic's Ecole Secondaire Sainte Marguerite d'Youville, for example, only five per cent of its students were away Tuesday compared to 33 per cent of its 450 junior and senior high school students one week earlier.</p>

</p>
<p>It is not in my nature to join a long line. In fact, I'm down on lineups in general.</p>
<p>I'm not a fan of physical pain, either. I avoid pain like the plague.</p>
<p>There's only one thing I avoid like the plague more than I avoid pain like the plague: The Plague.</p>
<p>So here I am, outside Westmount Centre on a sunny fall morning, lined up to get pig-stuck with not one, but two needles of anti-plague vaccine. Granted, the strains of flu available for catching these days might not qualify as The Plague.</p>
<p>But my raging, neurotic hypochondria will hear none of it.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's obsessing about the kid in the line ahead. The kid with the rattling cough. The Plague Carrier. I turn my back. And apply hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>It's 10:05 a.m. Monday and the line at the Westmount Centre stretches from the mall's north side, around the corner and down a block. I estimate a few hundred people are ahead of me.</p>
<p>It's relatively warm out. Good thing. A person could catch his death waiting for a flu shot.</p>
<p>By 10:15 I'm restless. My ADD kicks in hard and takes a run at my raging, neurotic hypochondria. My ADD gets its arse kicked. Fear of lingering death trumps boredom. So I stay.</p>
<p>I take out my BlackBerry, again. No new e-mail. Now I've got to pee. So I negotiate with the elderly gent behind me and run across to the library. When I return, the elderly gent pretends he can't remember me. For the rest of our shuffling journey together, I bust Harvey Appelt's chops about being senile.</p>
<p>Harvey, now retired, used to be a meat inspector. We chat until we notice a hush fall over the line. An ambulance drives slowly past. The medics eye us like meat inspectors.</p>
<p>Then a TV news crew shows up. The cameraman jokes that the H1N1 shot will turn us into zombies. My new motto: Better undead than dead.</p>
<p>Then, more boredom. In conversational gaps I distract myself with entrepreneurial ideas for H1N1 queues: Lawn chair rentals; pay toilets; funeral planning; drug dealing.</p>
<p>At 11:15 we reach the outside door. A child yells out: "I can see the light." It's the Plague Carrier. Go the light, child, the line will be shorter.</p>
<p>We shuffle inside and finally see clinic staff, who cheerily tell us we've reached the halfway point. Excuse me?</p>
<p>But that can't be. We can see the stairs now. One final ascent to the summit, a couple of horse needles and we're done. Right?</p>
<p>A sign by the stairs says: Caution, use handrail. No way, man. Hands use that handrail. I back away and sanitize twice for good measure.</p>
<p>We reach the top of the stairs, to a cavernous room.</p>
<p>The line snakes back and forth into the distance. Halfway there?If we're lucky.</p>
<p>A thought crosses my mind. Why not use your media credentials to whisk past everyone. Go up to one of the nurses, pretend to interview her, then say: Well, since I'm here, you might as well vaccinate me.</p>
<p>But the mom in front of me is minding three toddlers. She's packing one on her shoulders, while keeping the other two entertained.</p>
<p>She is awesome, in the true sense of the word. So is Harvey, who laughs at my lame senility jokes.</p>
<p>Then there's Gayle, who gets ushered next to us in line, then suffers a barrage of jokes about being a queue jumper.</p>
<p>Gayle, who is 40-ish, says her medical condition convinced her to line up for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Gayle: "It's a long story." Me: "Well, we have time."</p>
<p>We're soon swapping stories about life troubles. She once suffered a stroke and ended up in intensive care.</p>
<p>Her prognosis was so grim they unplugged the machines.</p>
<p>She laughs about it now, then teases me about being a fancy-pants columnist. I like her. In fact, I like everyone right now.</p>
<p>I bet another woman about the ETA of our needles. I offer to sell my spot for$1,000 to a man about 50 people back. The mood in line is strangely serene, even upbeat.</p>
<p>Sure, the system could be better. The city needs more vaccination sites. Frail citizens can't stand in line for hours.</p>
<p>But every human system is flawed, or starts out that way. Especially ones created in a rush, under fears of a public health emergency.</p>
<p>I've read that many people won't get the H1N1 vaccine because it's inconvenient.</p>
<p>Well, that's true. But you know what's really inconvenient? Carrying and spreading the H1N1 virus because you couldn't bother to line up.</p>
<p>I lost more than three hours of my life in that lineup. What I gained, besides a vaccine for illness and hypochondria, was a renewed sense of self and community.</p>
<p>The needle, when it came, hardly hurt. A bit of a letdown, to be honest.</p>
<p>The journey, as is often the case, trumped the destination.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Don't make bed closures an issue of public safety; Framing Alberta Hospital debate in those terms does disservice to patients</b>
</div><div>Austin Mardon   </div>
<div>Freelance</div>
<div>932 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The province, the premier and especially the new head of Alberta Health Services have been taking a lot of heat lately for belt-tightening decisions.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that we have to make tough financial decisions during this time of economic hardship, but no one can agree on what those cuts should look like.</p>
<p>Someone with a sick child would not want to see any cuts to the Stollery. Those with elderly parents don't want to see seniors' services cut. People like me, with a serious mental illness, are terrified about cuts to any mental health services, such as those proposed to Alberta Hospital Edmonton.</p>
<p>We can be quick to criticize and often very slow to praise. Lost in the rhetoric of recent weeks were some decisions that were just as difficult to make, but necessary and even courageous.</p>
<p>The province has added an expensive, but very promising new drug to the formulary called Respiradol Consta that had previously only been available on a limited basis, and then only to those on AISH. I am prejudiced where Consta is concerned, since it is the medication I use, and has been responsible for a dramatic improvement in my condition, and the quality of my life. I know I'm not the only one who feels this way about it since I've heard more than one AISH social worker describe it as a miracle drug.</p>
<p>Still, there were dissenting opinions about putting this medication on the formulary, but the premier and the health minister choose to side with patient well-being over finances, and I am profoundly grateful.</p>
<p>The second courageous decision the province made recently was in progressing with the use of Community Treatment Orders (CTOs). This is an issue that has been hotly debated in every jurisdiction where they have been implemented.</p>
<p>Just as a parent has to make difficult decisions sometimes for their children, the province has made the difficult call to force some mentally ill individuals to take treatment against their wishes when they are too ill to understand how sick they really are.</p>
<p>CTOs are vilified by civil libertarians, but a godsend to the families who can only stand hopelessly by and watch their loved ones drift away into madness. I applaud the premier and his ministers for being willing to add these two necessary items to the debit side of the provincial budget.</p>
<p>I had the privilege of speaking before the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees (AUPE)meeting several weeks ago about the potential bed closures. Those with schizophrenia fight against stigma every day of their lives, and I think it is important for me to speak at such events if for no other reason than to show them someone living with schizophrenia who is stable. That is not the stereotype that we deal with on a daily basis.</p>
<p>When I tell someone that I have schizophrenia, their first response is rarely delight. It is fear. I wouldn't get a worse response had I told them I had the H1N1 flu, and then proceeded to cough in their faces.</p>
<p>Statistics show that individuals with schizophrenia are many times more likely to harm themselves than act out violently toward anyone else. That doesn't keep people from being afraid of us, because when one of us does act out, it often ends up on the front page of the newspaper.</p>
<p>I guess that is why I have become increasingly troubled by the AUPE television ad campaign. When speaking about the loss of psychiatric beds, I try to focus on the harm that may do to patients. I want our community to take a realistic look at the services that are needed. I want people to engage in reasoned debate based on facts and not on sensationalism and fear.</p>
<p>One of the symptoms of my illness is an inability to read body language or social clues. It can make me seem rude, abrupt, or even clueless. Things that most children pick up easily on the playground, I had to be taught.</p>
<p>One lesson I did learn, is how to play fair. The Marques of Queensbury knew that there are lines we don't cross, even in a fight. Hitting below the belt is one.</p>
<p>Making the debate over bed closures about preventing the mentally ill from endangering the public is hitting below the belt. The mentally ill aren't helped by making the public more afraid of us than they are already.</p>
<p>It doesn't help anyone. All it does is take the focus off of where it should be: On the best interests of the patients.</p>
<p>If this debate was about closing cardiac beds, no one would suggest those heart patients were going to riot in the streets.</p>
<p>Ads that try to scare taxpayers by telling them the bed closures will endanger our safety aren't playing fair.</p>
<p>Increasing the stigma that we live with every day to scare the powers that be into taking an action they feel that can't fiscally take is a bullying tactic best left on the playground.</p>

<p>After reading all the information on the H1N1 vaccine, we decided to take a gamble and get the shot. After standing in line for hours at the Westmount Clinic and talking to the staff, here are some observations: - The government presently does not have enough vaccine for all Albertans; - There were 35 vaccination tables set up, but only seven were staffed by nurses; - A lot of time was lost by having staff and nurses fill out silly, meaningless forms.</p>
<p>Suggestions for improvement: - Many companies offer flu shots to their staff. Why not use this infrastructure that is already in place? - Get more nurses out and staff those empty vaccination tables; - Forget filling out forms. Just stick the needle in and get on with it. With the sore arm you get from the H1N1 vaccine, no one will come back for seconds; - Have more, smaller clinics available in communities to minimize the long lineups that discourage people from getting vaccinated.</p>
<p>Health officials did a very poor job of organizing this vaccination program.</p>

<p>Monday was the first day for the H1N1 shots in Alberta. It was a major failure.</p>
<p>Some groups have been deemed high risks and should be vaccinated first. Others should receive the vaccination later.</p>
<p>That is not what happened in Edmonton. If you stood in the line long enough, you got a shot. After waiting two hours in line at Westmount Centre, one man told me he and his son, who has Type 1 diabetes, were turned away. This is infuriating and has potentially dangerous consequences.</p>
<p>People who are most vulnerable to the H1N1 flu virus should get their shots immediately. This group includes pregnant women, those between six months and 24 years old, caregivers or parents of infants, health-care and emergency services personnel and people ages 25 through 64 who have certain health conditions.</p>
<p>But lines Monday were clogged with senior citizens and healthy adults over age 25.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services failed to ensure those of us at high risk could access the clinics. Instead, the clinics were a free for all.</p>

<p>Re: "Thousands brave chill for flu shots," Health Services looks for ways to streamline vaccinations; in the meantime, they suggest bringing a book," The Journal, Oct. 27.</p>
<p>I was troubled by the pictures of massive lineups and stories of long wait times for H1N1 shots in Calgary and Edmonton. Before blaming the minister and Alberta Health Services, I would ask readers to actually look at the pictures.</p>
<p>The priority groups at this time include pregnant women. Why are seniors--the only group who evidence shows should not be in early lineups--clogging the lines? Maybe the system can work, but it certainly cannot work unless people who are not priorities stay out of the lineups until the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Somebody running this show is definitely at fault for not properly advertising and managing the priorities.</p>

<p>Premier Ed Stelmach apologized Tuesday for disparaging remarks he made in the legislature about NDP Leader Brian Mason's old job as a bus driver.</p>
<p>But Mason wouldn't accept the premier's apology, saying it was halfhearted and disingenuous.</p>
<p>The spat started when Mason accused the premier of failing to provide the H1N1 vaccine for homeless and transient people. Mason's first question was referred to Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Yvonne Fritz.</p>
<p>After Fritz answered, Mason asked what the housing minister would know about a vaccine, then directed another question at Stelmach.</p>
<p>Stelmach replied: "...Mr. Speaker, you know what? I'm going to take the word of this nurse (Fritz) over any bus driver any doggone time."</p>
<p>"You know, we could all refer to each other by our previous jobs and I could do that to the premier, but it's beneath me and it should be beneath him as well," Mason shot back.</p>

</p>
<p>At least seven more deaths in Canada from the H1N1 virus came to light Tuesday as the second wave of the pandemic continued to spread, with some schools reporting absences akin to peak flu season and hospitals taking in more patients infected with the bug.</p>
<p>News that a 13-year-old Toronto boy area succumbed to the human swine flu came as thousands more Canadians crammed vaccination clinics for their second day of offering shots to those believed to be most at risk.</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health disclosed that Evan Frustaglio, a Grade 8 student and minor hockey player, who seemed otherwise healthy, died suddenly after showing only minor symptoms over the weekend.</p>
<p>"The sad news of this boy's death is a reminder that while most flu illness is mild, severe illness and death is a part of the picture of this pandemic," said David McKeown, Toronto's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Frustaglio began developing flu-like symptoms during a hockey tournament in London, Ont., over the weekend, said his father, Paul Frustaglio.</p>
<p>After returning to Toronto early Sunday, his parents took him to a local walk-in clinic, where he was examined and sent home.</p>
<p>"The physician listened to his lungs and assured us that everything is fine, he is breathing normally," Paul Frustaglio told CBC News. "Less than 24 hours later, my son was gone. That's all I know."</p>
<p>After the boy reportedly collapsed on the floor of his family home Monday morning, Paul Frustaglio rushed his son to St. Joseph's Health Centre, where he died. "It hit my son like a lightening bolt within a half-hour (Monday) morning."</p>
<p>British Columbia and Alberta also posted figures on their web-sites showing three more deaths in each of the two provinces since Friday, but the victims were not identified. Two of the victims died in the Fraser Valley region of B.C. and another death occurred in the Vancouver area.</p>
<p>The deaths bring the total of known deaths in Canada, related to complications from HIN1, to 94.</p>
<p>Included in the total is a preteen girl from eastern Ontario who fell victim on the weekend. More than 1,500 have been hospitalized and provinces reported that the numbers are growing.</p>
<p>As high-risk Canadians lined up at vaccination clinics across the country, Toronto announced it would speed up its public immunization campaign for high-priority residents, which will begin on Thursday, rather than next Monday as scheduled.</p>
<p>Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Arlene King, hinted that demand may outstrip supply, as she was unable to confirm a government plan to open vaccinations to the general public next week.</p>
<p>Shots are currently on offer to children between six-months and five-years-old, pregnant women, health-care workers and people under 65 suffering from chronic conditions, such as asthma.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, public health officials also struggled to cope for the second day. As Ottawa residents rolled up their sleeves, Ottawa's top health official reported that about 20 per cent of city schools have absentee rates of 10 per cent or higher.</p>
<p>While there is no proof that absent students have H1N1 flu, Dr. Isra Levy said the empty desks are the strongest indication yet of the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>A school in Quebec City wasn't taking any chances on Tuesday. When almost 18 per cent of students at the Sacre-Coeur primary school called in sick after coming down with flu-like symptoms, including fever, school officials ordered that the premises be disinfected.</p>
<p>A school board spokeswoman, however, cautioned that there were no confirmed cases of H1N1 and no students had been hospitalized at the time.</p>
<p>Dr. Bonnie Henry, director of public health emergency management at the B.C. Center for Disease Control, cautioned against reading too much into the deaths of two young people this week.</p>
<p>"The average age of hospitalization we're seeing is young children under 15," she said.</p>
<p>"Most of them get better, and their illnesses don't progress. But because there are so many people susceptible to this virus, it's inevitable that we're going to see people without any underlying risk factors get very sick and die from it, unfortunately."</p>
<p>Dr. Gerald Evans, president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada, said it's important to put the deaths of the two teens into context, because teens die during regular flu season, as well.</p>
<p>"It gets over-amplified because there is so much in the press right now about pandemic flu," he said.</p>
<p>"What we do know is that, whenever there are initial reports of healthy people, particularly healthy young people dying ... that this is going to drive people to suddenly rethink their position on whether they should be vaccinated or not."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province to ease flu-shot wait; Health minister publicly apologizes for long lineups</b>
</div><div>Archie Mclean and Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1106 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta's health minister apologized to people who waited in hours-long lineups for their H1N1 flu shots Monday before unveiling new measures meant to ease the crunch.</p>
<p>Ron Liepert said Alberta Health Services is setting up 11 new vaccination sites across the province.</p>
<p>No new clinics will be added in Edmonton, where five are currently running, though new ones will be set up in St. Albert, Sherwood Park and other outlying communities.</p>
<p>Calgary will get one new clinic.</p>
<p>In addition, physicians across the province will be able to order the vaccine to inoculate patients in their own clinics, since another shipment of 200,000 doses should arrive from Quebec on Thursday. That's on top of the 400,000 available doses.</p>
<p>More than 400 pharmacists who are certified to administer the shots can also place orders for vaccination supplies. The combined effect of all these new initiatives should soon see calmer situations at hectic clinics, Liepert said.</p>
<p>"I would say that within days this situation will be greatly alleviated," he said, adding that Monday's vaccination of 51,000 Albertans--which included 13,000 health-care workers --was a good start to the vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>In the last week, three Albertans have died from H1N1, bringing the provincial total to 12 deaths. Of the four deaths linked to the flu's second wave, two were from the Calgary area, one from south of Calgary and one from the Edmonton area.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, 38 more people were hospitalized.</p>
<p>In the Edmonton area, 13,579 people received the H1N1 shot Monday, compared to 9,619 who were immunized the first day of the seasonal influenza campaign last year.</p>
<p>"There are only so many trained professionals to handle this," said Liepert, noting that nursing staff had to be brought in from other health programs to roll out the H1N1 campaign.</p>
<p>It's good that so many Albertans want the vaccine, but he said, so far, it appears those who are healthy and not at high risk for getting the virus have overwhelmed the system.</p>
<p>"They wanted to be protected and that's not a bad thing," Liepert said. "But it clearly did create situations yesterday that were unacceptable and we're going to work toward making sure that we take corrective action."</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, Alberta's senior medical officer of health, urged healthy people to stay home right now to let priority cases to the front of the line. Healthy people won't be turned away or screened out, since some would still insist they need a shot, such as those going on holidays.</p>
<p>He said more nurses are being hired, including senior administrative nurses to work evenings and weekends. Home-care nurses may immunize people who aren't physically able to wait in line. For those who do go to the mass clinics, the goal is to have them in and out within 60 minutes.</p>
<p>"Obviously, we weren't as well prepared as we could have been, but we have no way of knowing how many people would show up," Predy said.</p>
<p>But Liberal Leader David Swann said the province's response to the crisis has been unacceptable, given the amount of time officials had to plan for it. He put the blame on the government's changes to the health-care system, including the termination of contracts for some provincial public health doctors last year.</p>
<p>"I don't think they have done a good job in health care and they know it. And Albertans are saying it in droves," Swann said.</p>
<p>Monique Melloche showed up at Bonnie Doon Mall around 6 p.m. Monday with her twin two-yearolds, but was turned away because the line was already too long. She went back around at the same time Tuesday and just made it in before closing time.</p>
<p>"I just want it as soon as possible for them, because I work in a hospital," she said of her children. "It would be nice to have more clinics open, but there's probably not many resources."</p>
<p>Gloria Pickard and her two sons all have asthma. They showed up at the mall around 6:15 p.m. and seemed likely to get in.</p>
<p>"I don't care if I have to wait, I'll wait," she said.</p>
<p>"But they should have more places open. They should have one line for people with health problems so they don't have to wait."</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach offered no apologies for his government's handling of the largest vaccination program in Alberta history.</p>
<p>"We're doing the best we can," Stelmach said. "And remember, we're running a health system at the same time."</p>
<p>Despite the scale of the vaccination program, Swann said Liepert and the government should not have been overwhelmed by it.</p>
<p>"This is not something new for Alberta. We've had thousands of clinics across this province for many, many years," he said. "Still, we see the inefficiency and long wait times. The premier and the minister today confirmed that they've covered 38,000 people (from the public) in one day. That's a good start, but with three million people, that's going to leave us until Valentine's Day before we get people fully immunized. I'm not sure that's performance."</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason said the government has failed the most vulnerable Albertans, especially those in Edmonton's downtown area.</p>
<p>"The inner-city clinics are telling us they can't get vaccine, they can't get an answer from Alberta Health," Mason said. "You've got people in rooming houses, you've got people in homeless shelters, you've got people on the street that are the most vulnerable of all. And those are the people we should be targeting first."</p>
<p>Cecilia Blasetti, executive director of Boyle McCauley Health Centre, disagreed with the criticism and said while there is no specific clinic dates for the inner-city population, she is hopeful something will be set up over the next week.</p>
<p>"Our people are going to be a priority soon," she said, noting that Alberta Health Services will be working with her health centre and the public health unit to make sure the shots get out to the vulnerable population.</p>

<div>673 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>M any hotels in Alberta suffered a summer tourism slump, a new report has revealed.</p>
<p>The global economic crisis, coupled with the threat of H1N1 flu and new passport rules for American travellers, created a "perfect storm" of factors that led to a tough season for tourism operators across the province, particularly in the major centres and the national parks.</p>
<p>Hotels in Banff National Park saw a significant drop in international visitors.</p>
<p>Banff revenues were affected by the competitive market and less discretionary spending by tourists, said the Post-Summer 2009 Alberta Tourism Operator Survey, which was prepared for the provincial Tourism Department.</p>
<p>Businesses tightening their belts and cutting back on corporate travel, meanwhile, also affected hotels in Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p>Major events such as WorldSkills and the world water ski championships helped some numbers, but not enough to keep local hotels from a difficult summer season, said Tourism Calgary's chief operating officer, Aldon Wells.</p>
<p>"It would have been a disaster without those events. You would have seen the trough much deeper than we saw," he said.</p>
<p>The combination of factors affecting tourism was a "perfect storm"--something the tourism industry has seen before, Wells said.</p>
<p>"Those perfect storms seem to be catching tourism quite often," he said. "Whether it's the wars in Iraq, the disease that we ended up going through with the cattle, they all come at the same time and it makes it difficult for anyone in the industry."</p>
<p>The global recession was the most significant factor in the drop in tourism numbers, according to the report, but Wells said there was some relief from the Travel Alberta "Stay" campaign.</p>
<p>The strategy had been in the works for a number of years, but the timing of the campaign--encouraging Albertans to explore their own province-- did help, Wells said.</p>
<p>Travel Alberta's new CEO said a lot of people living in the province did just as the ads suggested. "It was beyond our wildest dreams," Bruce Okabe said of the campaign.</p>
<p>While hotels and motels struggled with declining numbers, campground and RV park operators were busy.</p>
<p>For Sue Gyonyor, who runs the Buffalo Plains RV Park and Campground near Fort Macleod with her husband, 2009 was probably their busiest summer yet.</p>
<p>Those filling the 31 sites and some of their unserviced overflow lot mostly came from within the province but were staying longer than usual, she said.</p>
<p>"We have noticed a lot more people coming from Calgary, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge--and coming to stay four or five (nights) or even a week."</p>
<p>The family campground near Head-Smashed-in-Buffalo Jump did see some travellers from Switzerland, Germany and France, but had fewer making the trip from the United States, New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p>Gyonyor was expecting a good summer given the year started with more reservations than usual.</p>
<p>"I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. It was better than expected," she said.</p>
<p>Tourism operators now casting an eye to the future are hoping to see some ripple effect from the Winter Olympics in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Travel Alberta's Okabe said they hope to encourage visitors who want to see more of the country after coming for the games, and those tourists trying to avoid the spectacle altogether.</p>
<p>"We will see the Olympic aversion effect at Whistler-Blackcomb in the months of January to March because everyone has the impression it will be expensive, closed or busy," he said.</p>
<p>The hope is those looking to ski or snowboard will turn to Nakiska, Sunshine, Lake Louise and other Alberta hills instead.</p>
<p>In addition, Alberta will have a presence at the games in an effort to boost visitor numbers.</p>
<p>"We'll be using the Olympic Games to show the province to its advantage," Okabe said.</p>

<p>We have been inundated with messaging from various health organizations that we should get the seasonal and H1N1 flu shots. I believe it is my duty to remain healthy so that I can contribute to society and take care of my family. I arrived at Avenida Mall at 7:55 a.m. and was approximately 400 people from the start of the line. I was finally finished at 12:15. Imagine my indignation when I heard that the much smaller city of Winnipeg has 12 flu shot clinics. I believe that the people who made the decision to set up four clinics to service one million people are truly out of touch with reality. How many people are going to get sick because they had to wait more than four hours out in the cold to get a flu shot so they don't get sick?</p>

<p>Re: "Calgarians flood clinics for first H1N1 flu shots," Oct. 27.</p>
<p>I want to get an H1N1 flu shot, but I can't wait in a line at one of four clinics all day to get one and I am relatively young. What about the elderly? Is the health board going to make them wait in a line in the cold? When is the board going to allow pharmacies to give shots for free? We had appointments at our nearby pharmacy to get free regular shots, then we were called to say we would have to pay $18 for them. Has the board got an actual plan or do we all run around like chickens--or maybe pigs?</p>

<p>A U. S. government agency says the Internet in that country could actually break if an H1N1 flu pandemic forced millions to telecommute from home, a finding that has implications for Canada because the continent's telecommunications backbones are so closely connected.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office(GAO) --an agency whose function closely resembles Canada's auditor general -- warned this week that if millions of Americans stayed away from work or school because of the flu, but tried to work or study using home Internet connections, the resulting congestion would bring network traffic to a halt.</p>
<p>"A functioning Internet will be important during a pandemic because it could be one important way that governments and private entities share necessary information with the public," the GAO said.</p>
<p>"Using the Internet to allow people to communicate effectively without coming together physically would assist in creating 'social distance' to reduce the potential for illness to further spread. In addition, many organizations, including (U. S. public-health officials), have been advocating that businesses and other enterprises consider increased use of telework by their workforce as a way to continue operations, while maintaining physical separation from other workers during a pandemic."</p>
<p>But while the Internet "pipes" are built big enough around office towers or large post-secondary campuses to handle Internet use during a normal workday, the infrastructure that services most residential neighbourhoods is not designed for the kind of intensive use typical of most workplaces, said the GAO.</p>
<p>The GAO warned that government agencies, public-health agencies and other vital services could cease to function, or could function poorly, if Internet access disappeared or was disabled.</p>
<p>It also said more planning needed to be done by U.S. government agencies to prepare for such an eventuality.</p>
<p>Canwest News Service asked Industry Canada if federal government agencies had made backup plans, but had not received a response by late Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Telus and <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>, the country's biggest telecommunications firms, believe web services used by most consumers would remain up and running in most circumstances.</p>

<p>The lack of made-in-Canada medical evidence used to determine the safety of the H1N1 vaccine is a symptom of a weak and poorly funded public-health system, says one of this country's leading infectious disease experts.</p>
<p>"We systematically underfund public health badly and seriously. And if we don't fund public health, they can't do their job," said Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>McGeer was responding to Health Canada's decision to approve the H1N1 vaccine without evaluating its safety and effectiveness in a single Canadian.</p>

</p>
<p>Calgary's homeless shelters will soon start immunizing hundreds of people against the H1N1 virus, as the province tries to prevent a flu outbreak within the vulnerable population.</p>
<p>The Calgary Drop-In Centre, which sleeps about 1,100 people a night, expects to receive the vaccine today and will start immunizing its clients by Thursday or Friday.</p>
<p>"They are more vulnerable," said Dr. Janette Hurley, medical director at the shelter. "Many of them are immuno suppressed.</p>
<p>"So when you take that into consideration, from a public health perspective, you need to get them where they are at."</p>
<p>Hurley said homeless Calgarians also don't have the same opportunities to get to a clinic as the general population, which is why they are offering the vaccine directly to homeless people.</p>
<p>"We'll ask everybody to get immunized," she said, noting there's some hesitation among some of the shelter's clients. "It's a very useful vaccine to have. The benefits outweigh the risks."</p>
<p>Thousands of Calgarians stay at local homeless shelters each night, and the population has grown in the past year as the recession hits families hard.</p>
<p>Housing and Urban Affairs Minister Yvonne Fritz said homeless people are "extremely vulnerable to the H1N1 virus and they have very complex needs and a host of other needs as well.</p>
<p>"I can tell you that since they live in close quarters, traditional advice like stay home and rest is just not going to work."</p>
<p>As a result, Fritz said it's important to immunize the population on an "urgent basis" and noted Tuesday that the clinics will roll out to shelters across the province in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Another local agency, the Mustard Seed Street Ministry, will be immunizing its clients at the downtown location on Nov. 10.</p>

</p>
<p>All will soon be calm on the flu shot front, says Health Minister Ron Liepert, as more H1N1 vaccine arrives for doctors' offices, pharmacies and workplaces.</p>
<p>So Liepert sincerely hopes. So the cabinet prays.</p>
<p>The vaccination lineups threaten to explode into yet another serious political problem for beleaguered Premier Ed Stelmach.</p>
<p>Facing a party leadership review Nov. 7, the last thing he needs is more public hostility. There's already plenty going around for this premier who rarely misses a cow pie.</p>
<p>Stelmach hit one dead centre in the legislature Tuesday when ND Leader Brian Mason attacked the lack of plans for vaccinating the homeless.</p>
<p>After questioning Urban Affair Minister Yvonne Fritz, who bobbed and weaved as best she could, Mason asked Stelmach:</p>
<p>"Why have you ignored them?Why haven't you provided vaccine for them, Mr. Premier?"</p>
<p>Astonishingly, the premier retorted. "Mr. Speaker, you know what? I'm going to take the word of this nurse over any bus driver any doggone time."</p>
<p>Mason used to be a bus driver; Fritz worked as a registered nurse for 20 years. It's hard to imagine any facts less relevant to the debate. But Stelmach dragged them out with a bizarre crack that sounded dismissive toward working people. He surely didn't mean it; nobody who knows him personally would believe that.</p>
<p>But once again, the premier's deaf ear to political undertones turned an innocuous moment into trouble.</p>
<p>Mason took quick and brutal advantage. "We could all refer to each other by our previous occupations," he said. "I could do that to the premier, but it's beneath me. It should be beneath him as well. . . Your arrogance is beyond belief."</p>
<p>Stelmach later apologized to bus drivers. He couldn't have got to school without them, he said.</p>
<p>By now it was getting silly, but Mason clearly won on points. Master of only two legislature seats, he made the majority premier look inept at best.</p>
<p>Now the government has to hope the vaccination logjams clear quickly. In two days, there have already been several key mistakes.</p>
<p>Edmonton got five clinics and Calgary four--a blunder quickly corrected, but what were they thinking of?</p>
<p>Also, high-risk people were invited to get their shots first, but officials also said nobody would be turned away. The sick and the pregnant ended up in long lines.</p>
<p>The fifth clinic will now be reserved for those high-risk people. Why not establish it right at the start?</p>
<p>These mistakes were made, oddly enough, because the government really is trying to take politics out of health care.</p>
<p>The decisions were left entirely to the Health Services Board, which made them on medical grounds at a moment when vaccine supplies were limited.</p>
<p>Officials also misjudged the common sense of Albertans who ignored the bizarre mistrust of the vaccine that's sweeping the Internet.</p>
<p>Most of us will get through this vaccinated.</p>
<p>Some waits are inevitable in a unique situation.</p>
<p>It has to be said, too, that the dedicated health workers in the clinics are working themselves to exhaustion. But elements of this campaign have been botched, oddly enough, through a lack of sensible political calculation.</p>
<p>As usual the annoyance circles back to the government-- and a leader whose political sense could surely use a shot of something.</p>

</p>
<p>As the province's health minister apologized on Tuesday to Albertans who waited for hours to get the H1N1 vaccine, opposition parties warned the long lines are a symptom of nurse shortages and other fractures in the health system.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert acknowledged the province was caught off guard by the large number of Albertans-- nearly 38,000--who flooded immunization clinics across the province Monday, the first day of a massive vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>Liepert pointed to the federal government's early delivery of the vaccine and the challenge of finding and training appropriate medical staff as underlying causes for the long waits. He also noted many Albertans who sought early H1N1 shots were not part of high-risk groups, which include people under 65 with chronic health issues, pregnant women, and residents who live in remote or isolated communities.</p>
<p>"To those Albertans who lined up yesterday for several hours I would express my apologies for having to wait in line," Liepert said at the legislature. "Many who weren't considered high risk felt they wanted to be protected, and that's not a bad thing.</p>
<p>"But it clearly did create situations yesterday that were unacceptable and we're going to work towards making sure that we take corrective action."</p>
<p>The measures include setting up 11 additional vaccination clinics in Alberta, one of which is slated for Calgary. Liepert said the province will also soon distribute the vaccine to family doctors interested in giving the shot and to about 400 pharmacists who have been certified to handle the vaccine.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said he's encouraged Albertans appear to be keen to roll up their sleeves, despite opinion polls showing many Canadians were reluctant to get the H1N1 shot. He suggested the lengthy waits will soon diminish and dismissed the notion they point to a lack of government preparedness.</p>
<p>"We're doing the best we can," Stelmach said. "Remember we're running a health system at the same time."</p>
<p>Opposition parties, however, blasted the province's and health board's handling of the H1N1 campaign, contending the long lines and limited vaccination clinics underscore mismanagement.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader David Swann questioned why only nine clinics were established in Calgary and Edmonton when many more are set up each year for regular flu shots.</p>
<p>"This government has been warned for the past year that its handling of Alberta Health Services was creating an organizational train wreck," Swann said Tuesday, noting many people in the province's two largest cities stood in the cold for hours to get the vaccine, while several rural parts of Alberta don't yet have nearby H1N1 clinics. "Albertans are now living the train wreck and they're angry."</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason drew attention to what he contends are inadequate plans to quickly immunize homeless people and aboriginals. While he welcomed the extra clinics and new measures announced Tuesday, Mason suggested they underline a lack of planning.</p>
<p>"They've had months and months to plan this and yet they're unable to develop an effective plan to roll out the immunization," the NDP leader said, adding he suspects the province is struggling to deliver H1N1 vaccines in part because a shortage of nurses.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Do You Have The Cold Or Flu?</p>
<p>Many people confuse a cold with a flu. A cold generally takes a few days to develop, with sneezes and a runny nose. The flu can strike within three to six hours, hitting you like a tonne of bricks. The H1N1 virus has basically the same symptoms as the usual flu, with one exception: some people experience shortness of breath, which can be fatal. Here are some differences between the cold and the flu:</p>
<p>Cold Symptoms</p>
<p>Fever and chills are rare.</p>
<p>Stuffy nose and sneezing typically go away within a week.</p>
<p>Hacking, mucus-producing cough.</p>
<p>Mild to moderate chest discomfort.</p>
<p>Slight body aches and pains can be part of a cold.</p>
<p>If You Get The Flu, What Should You Do?</p>
<p>Rest, avoid contact with others and drink lots of fluids, suggests Alberta Health and Wellness. Consider using lozenges, nose drops and a warm salt water gargle. If your symptoms are severe, talk to a health professional.</p>
<p>Flu Symptoms</p>
<p>Fever and chills are usually present with the flu. A temperature of 100°F or higher for three to four days can be common.</p>
<p>Stuffy nose and sneezing not usually present.</p>
<p>Dry cough.</p>
<p>Severe chest discomfort.</p>
<p>Severe aches and pains.</p>

</div><div>Amy Husser And Mike Barber   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>708 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A 13-year-old minor league hockey player from Toronto has died of the H1N1 virus, Toronto Public Health confirmed Tuesday.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio began developing flu-like symptoms during a hockey tournament in London, Ont., over the weekend, said his father, Paul Frustaglio.</p>
<p>After returning to Toronto early Sunday, his parents took him to a local walk-in clinic, where he was examined and sent home.</p>
<p>"The physician listened to his lungs and assured us that everything is fine, he is breathing normally," Paul Frustaglio told CBC News. "Less than 24 hours later, my son was gone. That's all I know."</p>
<p>After the boy reportedly collapsed on the floor of his family home Monday morning, Paul Frustaglio rushed his son to St. Joseph's Health Centre, where he died. "It hit my son like a lightning bolt within a half-hour(Monday) morning."</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health, which did not identify the boy by name, said a news conference will be held Tuesday afternoon to provide an update on increasing flu activity in the city.</p>
<p>Frustaglio was a player with the Greater Toronto Hockey League's Mississauga North Stars minor bantam AA team.</p>
<p>GTHL president John Gardner said Tuesday that a team meeting was held Monday night to inform the players of Frustaglio's death.</p>
<p>"It's a tragedy, first of all, when any 13-year-old (dies)," said Gardner, urging parents not to panic.</p>
<p>"We're monitoring the situation very closely. I think the big thing here is we don't want parents to have a knee-jerk reaction. . . . These things, unfortunately, can happen in school or any place."</p>
<p>Mississauga North Stars president Peter Johnson added that the team has cancelled two games this week and has brought in grief counsellors for the other boys.</p>
<p>"We have heightened, across the organization, the defensive steps we need to take," said Johnson. "We are taking steps because we can't take any chances, but officially we don't know(what he died from); it's all just rumour right now."</p>
<p>Johnson said he knew of one other boy on the team who was sick and staying home.</p>
<p>He did not want to comment further out of respect for the family.</p>
<p>"All that is private. Dealing with grief is a private thing."</p>
<p>It is not clear if Frustaglio had any other underlying conditions. An autopsy was scheduled for Tuesday.</p>
<p>Paul Frustaglio said he wanted to remember his son as a "fun-loving kid" who liked to be the centre of attention, would help anybody and loved life.</p>
<p>"It's just not fair that a 13-year-old boy has to go so quickly," he said, sobbing. "It's just not right."</p>
<p>Frustaglio is the second young person to have died of swine flu within the last week.</p>
<p>Also on the weekend, a preteen girl from Eastern Ontario was admitted to hospital in Ottawa where she died of the H1N1 flu virus, according to Paul Roumeliotis, medical officer of health for the Eastern Ontario Health Unit.</p>
<p>The deaths coincided with the nationwide release of a vaccine for the virus.</p>
<p>On Monday, health authorities in Ontario suggested that all those under the age of 18 should get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I think it's quite appropriate for us to say now that we want to vaccinate all school-age children this week," said Roumeliotis.</p>
<p>As the vaccinations began Monday, thousands of at-risk Canadians waited patiently in long queues to be among the first to receive the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Lines containing hundreds of people snaked through shopping malls, arenas and community centres, as mothers and fathers pushing strollers, seniors, pregnant women and other Canadians believed to be most at risk of serious flu complications lined up before clinics opened.</p>

<p>With the H1N1 virus being linked to two deaths in recent days of Ontario children 13 and under, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Paediatric Society says parents should be honest with their kids about the virus and try to keep them calm.</p>
<p>Parents have an arsenal of information at their fingertips to keep their families as safe as possible from H1N1, but with otherwise healthy kids dying from H1N1 complications, federal health authorities and pediatric experts are stressing the importance of the H1N1 vaccine and education.</p>
<p>"For children, you have to explain, 'Yes it hurts, but then it's over with,' and then it protects you from getting much sicker," said Dr. Danielle Grenier, medical affairs director for the Canadian Paediatric Society. "Be honest, and get it done--that's No. 1.</p>
<p>"You need to explain that you can get sick with the flu, but if you get the vaccine (your chances) are going down . . . You have to be very positive and stay away from alarming them . . . They need that reassurance and know that their parents will do everything they can for them."</p>
<p>On Monday, 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio--a minor hockey player from Toronto--died of H1N1 after falling ill on Sunday. In a separate case, an eastern Ontario preteen girl died in an Ottawa hospital after getting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Grenier said getting vaccinated is the safest way to protect entire families and strongly recommended that parents of young children consider getting the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>"This is the circle of care-- everybody who is around that child should be vaccinated to protect that child," said Grenier, who has been practicing child medicine for 31 years. "That's the most important thing because they are considered a high-risk group.</p>
<p>"If you have a child under five years old, and you're a parent, that child is in an at-risk group and you as a parent need to be vaccinated to protect your own."</p>
<p>Grenier also recommends children spend more time playing outside instead of hanging out in closed spaces, such as shopping malls, to keep themselves better protected against the virus.</p>
<p>Tips to protect your family from H1N1: - Wash your child's hands, or teach them to wash their own hands, for at least 20 seconds. - When possible, cover their coughs and sneezes and encourage older children to sneeze into their arms instead of their hands. - For children over the age of six months, have them receive vaccines for both the seasonal flu and the H1N1 virus. - Talk to your children about germs and how they spread. - Encourage children to keep their hands away from their faces to avoid the spread of germs. - Keep children at home from group activities, including day care, if they are ill. Ensure they are free of all symptoms before allowing them to resume group activities. - Maintain clean surfaces on toys and other surfaces within the home.</p>

</div><div>Michelle Lang   </div>

</p>
<p>A s medical officials confirmed three more H1N1-related deaths in the province Tuesday, Alberta Health Services announced a fifth Calgary clinic to tackle massive lineups for immunizations against the new flu strain.</p>
<p>The health superboard said it's opening the new clinic today at 8:30 a.m. at the Olympic Oval to serve people who have trouble standing in lineups, including pregnant women, young children and seniors.</p>
<p>The organization is also trying to boost access to existing swine flu vaccine clinics by increasing staff and the number of vaccination stations at the existing sites.</p>
<p>On Monday, about 8,000 Calgarians received a shot at the local H1N1 vaccination clinics, leading to waits as long as six hours and criticism four sites were not enough for the city.</p>
<p>"We have had long lineups, so this is our attempt to try to respond to some of the very important concerns that were raised yesterday," Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health for the superboard, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>To boost staffing at the clinics and open a fifth location, Alberta Health Services is suspending Calgary Community Health Centres--where vaccines for sicknesses such as measles and mumps are delivered -- for at least one week to redeploy staff and resources.</p>
<p>The changes to the H1N1 clinics come as Alberta Health announced the number of deaths in the province linked with the new strain of influenza has risen to 12 from nine since Friday.</p>
<p>The victims include a Calgary woman who was in her 50s, an elderly man from Edmonton and a woman over age 50 from the southern part of the province.</p>
<p>All three are believed to have had risk factors that would predispose them to developing a serious disease from the virus.</p>
<p>Nearly 200 people in Alberta have been hospitalized with H1N1 since the outbreak began last spring.</p>
<p>At some of the Calgary H1N1 vaccination clinics, meanwhile, lineups appeared to be shorter Tuesday than when the massive vaccination campaign was launched a day earlier.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon, patients at the Whitehorn clinic in northeast Calgary were only waiting a few minutes to receive a shot.</p>
<p>"There was no wait," said Glynese Brown, 62. "By the time I grabbed a number, I was in. My husband waited five hours yesterday."</p>
<p>Jill Lockerbie, a 35-year-old pregnant Calgarian, said she waited 10 minutes at the clinic.</p>
<p>"I think people were scared off by media reports of seven-hour waits," she said.</p>
<p>However, some patients at other locations in the city said they waited at least three hours for a shot and felt Calgary should have far more flu shot locations.</p>
<p>Several people noted that Winnipeg health officials set up 12 clinics for a city that is smaller than Calgary.</p>
<p>"It's appalling," said Julia Hillier, 24, as she stood in a long line at the Brentwood Village clinic.</p>
<p>"If we're a city of a million, how can that small number of clinics serve us?"</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said the new Calgary clinic and the additional vaccination stations at existing sites should help ease the lineups.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert also said Tuesday the province will set up 10 other H1N1 vaccination clinics, in addition to the new Calgary location.</p>
<p>Officials with Alberta Health did not provide details on where the other 10 sites will be. Meanwhile, Alberta Health Services did confirm at least one rural area ran out of the shots Tuesday, but said doses will be redistributed to ensure clinics can continue operating.</p>
<p>In Calgary, the Olympic Oval clinic is targeted at pregnant women, children aged six months to less than 10 years, seniors and accompanying family members.</p>
<p>The clinic, on the second floor of the Oval at the University of Calgary, will be open Mondays to Thursdays from 8:30 a.m. to 8 p.m. and Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m..</p>
<p>The other four clinics in the city will operate under the same time schedule.</p>
<p>The province had 400,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine at the start of the week and expected to receive more within days.</p>
<p>Seasonal flu shots are being suspended at Calgary H1N1 flu clinics to concentrate on the swine flu vaccine.</p>

<p>Colorado Avalanche backup goalie Peter Budaj has been diagnosed with swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The team's coach, Joe Sacco, confirmed the illness after practice Tuesday morning in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Budaj missed his scheduled first start of the season last Friday because of the flu.</p>
<p>"We've taken the necessary steps, the necessary precautions, to keep him away from the guys at the right time," Sacco told the Denver Post. "Hopefully, he'll be joining us on this trip."</p>
<p>Tyler Weiman, recalled from Lake Erie last week, will replace Budaj behind starter Craig Anderson.</p>

<p>Like most people, the Ottawa Senators are trying to cope with the threat of the H1N1 flu virus through common sense.</p>
<p>There are hand sanitizers mounted everywhere you look. Players are being made more conscious of coughing into their sleeves, of not using the same towels on the bench, and especially of not using the same water bottles.</p>
<p>As for getting the H1N1 flu shot, they're in the same boat as everyone else: stand in line.</p>
<p>There's no special dispensation for professional hockey players.</p>
<p>They may be able to jump to the front of the line -- for a price, of course -- for an MRI. But if they want a flu shot, they have to stand in line like everyone else.</p>
<p>"We are doing everything we can to make sure our players are accommodated and safe," said general manager Bryan Murray.</p>
<p>"Our intent would be for them to receive the vaccine, but like every member of the public, we have to wait our turn for that to happen. That's on a schedule that I really don't have any control over."</p>
<p>The flu has already claimed several victims. Pascal Leclaire, Peter Regin, and Erik Karlsson were all sidelined by it this week.</p>
<p>This is something that generally happens once a year to every team in the league, but the H1N1 scare makes it more of a concern.</p>
<p>"I think it's the same thing every year," said Leclaire.</p>
<p>"We try to wash our hands as much as we can. You try to keep the bottle that you drink out of, and not cough into everybody's face. There's nothing really special about it.</p>
<p>"Everybody tries to be a little smart about it, but it's hard just to get away from it, too. Do what we can, I guess."</p>
<p>He said he'd probably get the H1N1 vaccine if the team's doctors thought it was going to help them.</p>
<p>Regin didn't know whether he would get the vaccine. He also was waiting to hear what the doctors said. But he was taking precautions, in particular using his own water bottle.</p>
<p>Daniel Alfredsson said he doesn't plan to get a flu shot, but that he could change his mind.</p>
<p>He also said if he were in the playoffs right now, he wouldn't hesitate to shake hands at the end of a round.</p>
<p>Back to Wood for Spezza?</p>
<p>As he enters his 10th game without a goal, Jason Spezza set two special sticks aside for the team's two-game trip to Florida. They were two of his private stock of Sherwood wood sticks.</p>
<p>For the past two seasons, Spezza has been using a Reebok composite stick with a wood blade. It's been OK. He has eight assists, but no goals.</p>
<p>So he has occasionally taken the wood sticks out of storage, as he did in the shootout of Saturday's game against the Boston Bruins, when he was thwarted by Tim Thomas.</p>
<p>Injury Update</p>
<p>Defenceman Filip Kuba (lower body) and centre Peter Regin (flu) practised with the team Tuesday and it appears that both will be able to play tonight against the Panthers.</p>
<p>But coach Cory Clouston hedged a bit, suggesting he'll wait to see how the players feel this morning.</p>

<p>All Ottawans have a duty to get vaccinated against the pandemic H1N1 flu. But not yet.</p>
<p>For this week, and possibly next, the duty of most Ottawans is to stay away from the clinics and let people in high-risk groups get the vaccine.</p>
<p>It's hard to say how many people were at the clinics in the first day or two who shouldn't have been there, and it certainly isn't anyone's right to pass judgment on the person standing in front of them in line. Many people have chronic health conditions that aren't apparent, or they might be caregivers for infants or people with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>And we can also all give some benefit of the doubt to people who might have been a little confused about the definition of "priority group" as the vaccination program began. The fact that at least one health unit in Ontario -- but not Ottawa, so far -- is adding children under 18 to the list might add to the confusion, and lead more people to stand in line with children who aren't eligible.</p>
<p>If you're at all confused, though, check the website at ottawa.ca/health. The priority groups are listed in clear language.</p>
<p>Long line-ups are themselves a risk.</p>
<p>People with some chronic conditions, or pregnant women with swollen feet, or nursing mothers, are likely to find it difficult to stand in line for several hours, especially since some line-ups are outside in the rain and chilly weather. They'll also worry that spending that much time in a crowd might itself be a risk factor for catching flu.</p>
<p>So if the line-ups stay this long, people in high-risk groups might delay getting the vaccine. That would lead to serious consequences for them and for our health-care system.</p>

<p>There is a whole demographic of Ottawans for whom Ottawa has failed to provide reasonable access to the H1N1 vaccine. We are the people who live centrally in the most built-up and densely populated area of this city, who are out and about mingling on foot every day, who rely upon and support public transit, who don't have a car, who don't have the $80 to $120 in taxi fares needed to get to one of those vaccination centres in the boonies, and who must be at work during the four dates with short stints for vaccinations scheduled to be held at City Hall at 110 Laurier Ave, W. (We wouldn't all even fit into that building in such a short time frame.)</p>
<p>It is a public health authority's job to get a vaccine to the public. Yet, our city has located the H1N1 vaccine in places that only car users can reach.</p>
<p>Toronto has 67 clinics with many dotted across its downtown core. On the basis of population, Ottawa should then have 21 centres but we have only seven and these seven are completely inaccessible without a car.</p>
<p>In South America this summer during its winter, cities with populations of up to 13,000,000 put their seasonal flu vaccine in outlets everywhere across the downtown. It took at most 15 minutes' walking or a seven-minute bus along packed streets to get a flu shot and this delivery system wasn't even touted as an achievement. A city in a wealthy country like Canada is fully capable of doing at least what a Third World country does naturally for its people.</p>
<p>We desperately need full-time clinics downtown. If Ottawa doesn't do this now, it must instead put the H1N1 vaccine destined for our downtown population into the hands of our downtown's family physicians and pharmacies.</p>

<p>I took my young children to receive the H1N1 vaccine Monday. It took just over five hours. I commend the public health staff on their professionalism in a difficult situation.</p>
<p>Every Canadian should be vaccinated, but waits of this length will deter many of them. The reason the process is so slow is that Ottawa public health and the ministry of health are trying to collect very detailed data on every patient who is vaccinated. This takes time and personnel. No doubt this data will be very useful, but the priority should be to vaccinate as many people as possible, quickly. The actual injection does not take long, and could be even quicker if the syringes were drawn up ahead of time.</p>
<p>As for all the paperwork, the patients could fill out any necessary forms in the lines, and it could all be inputted into ministry databases at a later date. Public health must streamline the process if we are to have any hope of averting the looming disaster: a full-blown pandemic.</p>

<p>Re: Ottawans swarm flu clinics, Oct. 27.</p>
<p>I am a family physician in Barrhaven who was very disappointed at the way the H1N1 clinics were organized.</p>
<p>As a high risk, front-line worker who already has had to care for many patients stricken with the H1N1 illness, I went to the City of Ottawa administrative building at 100 Constellation Dr. immediately after work on Monday evening. When I got there at 6 p.m., the nurse told me they had reached their capacity of 500 for the evening. The rest of us were told to come back two to three hours earlier another day and wait in a line outside the building in order to have a better chance to get the shot.</p>
<p>Is this what health-care workers, young children, pregnant women and people with significant health issues have to do to get a shot?</p>
<p>My group of doctors in Barrhaven cares for about 4,000 patients. At the rate of 125 people immunized per hour, the four time slots allotted for Barrhaven patients at Walter Baker Sports Centre today and Thursday and on two dates in November will only care for 3,000 patients, not even taking into account the children under nine who need two shots. Although the health officials are urging everyone to get immunized, how are they planning to immunize more than 40,000 people in Barrhaven in 24 hours of clinic time?</p>
<p>Why didn't the health officials ask the family physicians and walk-in clinics to help with the vaccinations as we do the regular flu shots? Everyone would probably have been immunized much faster and more efficiently than under the present system.</p>

<p>- Making swine flu vaccinations free would spur their uptake, according to a survey of Hong Kong residents that showed demand would wane if a charge was incurred. A shot given free would persuade about 45 per cent of respondents to be immunized against the new H1N1 influenza virus. Acceptance fell to 15 per cent if it cost more than $26 U.S., researchers at the Chinese University of Hong Kong said in a study published in the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>- China has placed orders for 42 million doses if vaccine, but it plans to inoculate only five per cent of the population, or 65 million people, against swine flu by year's end. So far, 300,000 people have received the vaccination. More than 35,000 cases of H1N1 have been reported in China, and two deaths have been confirmed.</p>
<p>- Russia has recorded 1,349 confirmed cases of swine flu, with four dead. Two people have died in Turkey. Worldwide, at least 4,999 people have died from swine flu infections since April, the World Health Organization said.</p>

<p>Demand for H1N1 vaccinations in Ontario may temporarily outstrip supply, the province's top public health official hinted Tuesday, as she was unable to confirm a government plan to open vaccinations to the general public next week.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, said officials would focus on vaccinating priority groups next week, including children between six months and five years old, pregnant women, health-care workers and people under 65 suffering from chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>"We will start adding other groups as supply permits," King told reporters. "But I think it's going to be very vaccine-supply dependent on how quickly we can get it into everyone else."</p>
<p>That message is very different from one being delivered by Ontario's Ministry of Health, which says clinics across the province will be open to the general public as of Monday.</p>
<p>"Starting next week, and we're saying that for everyone, if you're part of the average population -- under 65, no chronic health conditions, not taking care of an infant --you are free to go out and get a shot," said Ivan Langrish, a spokesman for Health Minister Deb Matthews.</p>
<p>Toronto public health officials have also announced broad public access to H1N1 vaccines beginning on Monday.</p>
<p>It was unclear why King's office and ministry officials were issuing such different messages.</p>
<p>Langrish said the province was still having a hard time figuring out how high demand for the flu vaccination would be.</p>
<p>"She's being measured about it," he said, suggesting King was taking a cautious approach to the sequenced rollout.</p>
<p>The comments come in the wake of the death of a 13-year-old Mississauga boy Monday.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio, an avid hockey player, became the city's first victim of the H1N1 virus this fall.</p>
<p>Despite the death, Ontario officials are not considering including all youth 18 years and younger in the priority group.</p>
<p>King said that decision was due partly to a numbers game.</p>
<p>"We are monitoring our supply and our capacity to deliver on a day to day basis to determine how quickly we can actually roll out the program," she said.</p>
<p>She added death from H1N1 was very rare in that age group.</p>
<p>Since April, 28 Ontarians have died of the H1N1 flu virus, including six children. The average age of those who die from the virus is 55.</p>
<p>Ontario has received roughly 1.72 million doses of the vaccine, more than half of which are being shipped to local health units.</p>
<p>"We will have enough to immunize everyone who needs and wants it in the province of Ontario," King said. "But we aren't getting it all at once."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Weakened system put to the test; The lack of Canadian trials of the vaccine is a symptom of a bigger problem, expert says</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>951 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The lack of made-in-Canada medical evidence used to determine the safety of the H1N1 vaccine is a symptom of a weak and poorly funded public-health system, one of this country's leading infectious disease experts says.</p>
<p>Those weaknesses are apparent when quick, decisive action is needed to respond to a pandemic, said Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"We, as a society, are unwilling to pay for public health in this country," McGeer said Tuesday. "We systematically underfund public health badly and seriously, and if we don't fund public health, they can't do their job."</p>
<p>McGeer was responding to Health Canada's decision last week to give its stamp of approval to the H1N1 vaccine without evaluating its safety and effectiveness in a single Canadian.</p>
<p>Instead, the federal drug regulator approved the pandemic flu shot based on the results of a small clinical trial conducted in Belgium.</p>
<p>The study involved 130 healthy adults, who were inoculated with the same version of Canada's vaccine, which is produced by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> under the trade name Arepanrix.</p>
<p>In the race to approve the vaccine, experts say Health Canada didn't have time to wait for Canadian scientists, who started testing the Glaxo vaccine two weeks ago and indicated it could take up to seven weeks to collect the early results from Canadian test subjects.</p>
<p>The situation stands in marked contrast to the United States, where federally funded scientists last month published early results of their safety and effectiveness tests weeks ahead of the vaccine's approval by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p>The fact that a similar sequence of events did not happen in Canada points to inherent weaknesses with the Public Health Agency of Canada, which does not have a large enough budget to commission its own pre-market vaccine studies, McGeer said.</p>
<p>"Yes, we should have better data. Yes, we should have been doing pre-licensure trials of vaccines in Canada. Yes, we should have better communication. Yes, we should have better expertise nationally. But you want that? You just have to pay for it."</p>
<p>In the race to test and approve the H1N1 vaccine, experts say, Health Canada was caught between getting the pandemic flu shot to Canadians as quickly as possible and ensuring enough science was done to establish its safety and effectiveness.</p>
<p>Complicating the situation were indications that the pandemic's second wave was intensifying in many parts of the country.</p>
<p>While large clinical trials are always more reliable, the federal drug regulator chose to move as soon as some scientific evidence was available. That came in the form of the Belgian study, which allowed Health Canada to issue an "interim order," an emergency measure that stops short of granting Glaxo a full market licence to sell the vaccine.</p>
<p>"It's obviously a situation of competing priorities," said Dr. David Scheifele, director of the vaccine evaluation centre at British Columbia's Child and Family Research Institute. "One wants to get a vaccine out as quickly as possible, and that does limit the amount of data that you can generate."</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Hébert, an expert in clinical trials at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, believes Health Canada made the right call.</p>
<p>"All of this extra data collection costs us millions, and it means the vaccine is going to get out slower," said Hébert, who is also editor-in-chief of the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>In an editorial published in last month's journal, Hébert criticized the federal government for rolling out the H1N1 vaccine too slowly, particularly for high-risk groups such as health-care workers and pregnant women.</p>
<p>In addition to the Belgian data, Scheifele said, federal regulators would have also drawn on the "huge foundation of evidence" that exists over more than 50 years of producing seasonal flu vaccines. The method involves growing a vaccine virus in hen's eggs, purifying it and then treating it with a chemical that inactivates it.</p>
<p>The technology has such an established safety record that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, "which is one of the most conservative, cautious regulators on the planet, requires no testing of the seasonal flu vaccine at all before it's released," Scheifele said.</p>
<p>Health Canada requires each year's seasonal flu vaccine to be tested in at least 120 healthy adults. The regulation was introduced after an incident nine years ago, when more than 900 people across Canada became ill after being injected with a flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Their symptoms, including trouble breathing, chest tightness, coughing and wheezing, were diagnosed as oculorespiratory syndrome. Scientists attributed the symptoms to the Fluviral vaccine. Shire Biologics, the manufacturer, has since reformulated it.</p>
<p>McGeer says fewer than one in 10,000 people who get seasonal flu shots suffer from rare side-effects such as oculorespiratory syndrome.</p>
<p>The rates of Guillain-Barré Syndrome, a neurological condition that can cause temporary paralysis, are even more rare, affecting less than one in a million people who are vaccinated against flu.</p>
<p>In contrast, swine flu is estimated to have killed more than two in every million so far.</p>
<p>For that reason, McGeer said, choosing not to get the H1N1 vaccine would be risky behaviour.</p>

<p>- At least seven more deaths in Canada from the H1N1 virus came to light Tuesday. In addition to confirmation that Toronto's Evan Frustaglio, 13, had died of swine flu, British Columbia and Alberta posted figures showing three more deaths in each of those provinces since Friday. Those victims were not identified. The deaths bring the total of known deaths in Canada related to complications from HIN1 to 94. More than 1,500 have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>- In Calgary, people began lining up before dawn for their shots at all four of the city's clinics, with as many as 800 people crowded outside one shopping-mall venue when the doors opened. Similar scenes played out in Victoria and in Edmonton. Montrealers officials scrambled to distribute 155,000 doses of the vaccine that were delivered to the city over the weekend. That means workers at most Montreal hospitals, who were expected to start receiving shots Monday, will have to wait until next week.</p>

</p>
<p>Lines were long again, and patience short, on Day 2 of Ottawa's flu vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>For frustrated people who ask, "What's taking them so long?" part of the answer lies in the paperwork.</p>
<p>A case in point: At the Kanata Recreation Centre, a nurse in blue stuck a needle into a bare shoulder at 3:19 p.m., and had the pinprick wiped off and "Band-Aid-ed" in seconds, but it was nine minutes before she jabbed a needle into someone else.</p>
<p>The nurse was working non-stop. However, it took five minutes before the shot to ask her patient a series of questions. Two more minutes after the shot for follow-up questions. A couple of minutes more for record-keeping.</p>
<p>While her next patient zipped through in record time (he was a medical doctor), the one after that was a little girl. It took 10 full minutes to talk to her mother, reassure the child and give the shot.</p>
<p>So it went, all afternoon and evening.</p>
<p>"Even after five or six hours of wait, people are patient ... very patient, considering they've been there with young children who are hungry and tired," said Dr. Isra Levy, the city's medical officer of health. "But obviously we saw a lot of frustrated people, and that's disappointing for us.</p>
<p>"The biggest concern I have is that those people will not come back (after being turned away.) This is a good intervention and people need it."</p>
<p>Dozens were turned away before 2 p.m. at Fred G. Barrett Arena Tuesday, as only people holding numbers given out Monday received shots Tuesday.</p>
<p>The rink on Leitrim Road was the busiest of the city's new vaccination clinics Monday and hundreds were sent home still holding butcher-style priority numbers that gave them places in line. Only those who kept their ticket stubs overnight were seen Tuesday.</p>
<p>Norma Pichia arrived at 12:15 p.m. and waited nearly two hours before being disappointed.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's right," she said. "I have a heart problem, and I've been waiting all this time, and now they're sending us home."</p>
<p>Pichia said she would try again today, but was frustrated by the lack of organization and communication at the south-end clinic.</p>
<p>Pavel Estefanov booked the day off work Tuesday to take his two-year-old son to get the shot, and he never even obtained a number.</p>
<p>"It's stupid," Estefanov said. "They should have told us what was happening from the beginning. I waited here a couple of hours for nothing."</p>
<p>Levy called the flu campaign "a multi-month exercise, the biggest campaign in Canadian history. All the people who want to be vaccinated are not going to get vaccinated on Day 1.</p>
<p>"What we learned (on Monday) is that things do tend to go a little more slowly than we thought. People have questions. Parents of young children, sometimes disabled people, when they're at the immunization stations and they're in front of a nurse, they often have questions, so it's going somewhat more slowly than we thought."</p>
<p>As a result, Levy's staff recalculated the hoped-for estimate of a top capacity of 12,000 shots a day. It will be more like 8,400 a day -- double Monday's total -- once all the wrinkles are ironed out, unless the department can find more staff, Levy said.</p>
<p>The goal is to limit waits to one hour after the initial surge of demand.</p>
<p>Some new staffers have already arrived. Paramedics have joined nurses in giving shots, and extra public-health workers are on duty to answer questions. There were 357 workers spread among the six clinics, up from 260 on Monday.</p>
<p>At Tom Brown Arena on the west side of downtown, the line was about 20 people deep at noon, and the first person -- spooked by Monday's lengthy wait -- arrived before 9 a.m.</p>
<p>"You're going to have to wait, either way," said Kenny Moore, who arrived at the arena around 11 a.m. "The difference is you line up now and get in or you line up later and risk it."</p>
<p>About 40 people had lined up at the Vanier clinic by 1 p.m. on Tuesday. Parents brought lots of material to entertain their children during the wait, including cards, games and a mobile DVD player.</p>
<p>Martha LeBreton was first in line with her two-year-old son, neighbour Claire Pilon and Pilon's 11-year-old granddaughter.</p>
<p>"I've never gotten the flu shot, even though my family has gotten the flu twice before, but I'm going to have my family get (the H1N1 shot) because this has killed people and I'm not going to risk dying," LeBreton said. "I think all kids should get it."</p>
<p>Orthopedic surgeon J. P. Desjardins of The Ottawa Hospital came to the Kanata clinic with his wife, arriving at about 12:30 p.m. (two hours early) and getting the process wrapped up a little after 3:30.</p>
<p>"There were about 150 before us," he said.</p>
<p>The doctor wasn't impressed with the system of centralized clinics.</p>
<p>"They should have obviously distributed the vaccine a lot more to the hospitals. Hospital clinics should have had them, as well as medical clinics in Plantagenet and places like that," he said. "The organization is not right."</p>
<p>At the city's vaccination clinic on Centrum Boulevard in Orléans, the line was cut off early in the afternoon, and then reopened. Staff distributed about 700 numbers to people who had been in line, and when they ran out, newcomers were turned away.</p>
<p>With a line still forming outside, however, they soon decided to distribute another 500 numbers with the recommendation that anyone getting a number after 3:30 p.m. return at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>The staff at the clinic said that if they didn't get through all the numbers last night, leftover numbers would be honoured when the clinic reopens this afternoon.</p>
<p>Levy acknowledged that the record-keeping causes some delay.</p>
<p>"People are signing a consent form. And the consent form has very detailed information," he said. "Obviously when anyone receives vaccine or a medication, one of the steps that a health care practitioner goes through is (to) make sure the person understands what they're doing, and we're very fastidious with our consents. And that means informing people of studies that have been done."</p>
<p>There's additional record-keeping for this year's vaccine, he said. "What we are doing is tracking very closely and very carefully everyone who gets the vaccine, which is typically done for any new intervention."</p>
<p>At the Nepean clinic on Constellation Drive, lines were smaller than the day before. With scheduled hours of 5-9 p.m., the clinic, on Day 1, stayed open late, vaccinating people until after 11 p.m. Tuesday night, they kept to the scheduled hours.</p>
<p>Although the line was cut off partway through the evening, based on time projections, not nearly as many people were turned away as the night before.</p>
<p>Sherry Beadle, a public health manager on site at the Constellation clinic, said things were certainly improved on Day 2.</p>
<p>"We learned from yesterday," she said.</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 flu clinics in the western part of the Ottawa Valley will begin this week and continue throughout next week as public health officials confirm that the swine flu virus is spreading widely.</p>
<p>The clinics will begin Thursday at two locations in the Leeds, Grenville and Lanark District Health Unit, while public clinics for the Renfrew County and District Health Unit will start on Monday at 10 locations.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Corriveau, medical officer of health of the Renfrew health unit, said the district didn't publish a list of H1N1 cases, but he acknowledged that the numbers are growing.</p>
<p>"We know it has been identified everywhere in our jurisdiction," he said. "It is circulating pretty vigorously, but no deaths to date."</p>
<p>He said the health unit was monitoring schools in the district and about five of them had reported absentee rates of about 15 per cent because of flu-like symptoms. Ontario requires school authorities to report absentee rates of 10 per cent to health officials.</p>
<p>Corriveau said Renfrew just completed seasonal-flu clinics for seniors. He said the health unit distributed most of the first batch of 4,500 doses of the H1N1 flu vaccine it received to hospitals and physicians, and the rest would be administered to paramedics this week. Public clinics will begin Monday at locations stretching from Arnprior to Pembroke and Barrys Bay.</p>
<p>"We decided to differ a bit from Ottawa in the sense that we have distributed our initial lot of vaccine to the primary-care system -- hospitals, physicians -- the people that will have access to the high-risk priority groups," he said. "Because of our geography, and given we are a very spread-out community, we thought it was better to get the vaccine to our primary-care partners than try to run clinics."</p>
<p>Corriveau says the health district is expecting another 4,500 doses of the vaccine this week; that will go to clinics to be administered according to priorities set by the province. He said among those first in line would be people under 65 with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and healthy children from six months old to five years. He advised area residents to honour the priority list because anyone not listed would likely not get the flu shot.</p>
<p>In Leeds, Grenville and Lanark, flu clinics have so far been planned at the Brockville Memorial Centre and the Smiths Falls Collegiate Institute. The communications co-ordinator for the health district, Susan Healey, said efforts to open more locations were under way, and she advised residents to keep checking the health unit's website for more information. Those first in line to receive shots include health workers, people under 65 with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and new mothers within four weeks of delivery.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>High-priority status for schools reconsidered; Getting clinics up to capacity top priority</b>
</div><div>Tom Spears, Maria Cook and Joanne Laucius   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1295 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ottawa's public-health department is reconsidering raising school-aged children to high-priority status for the first round of H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>The question "is actually under active consideration amongst all provincial medical officers of health," medical officer of health Dr. Isra Levy said Tuesday during a brief news conference.</p>
<p>Asked whether children should get shots sooner, he replied that the question was "largely moot" because everyone was now at risk.</p>
<p>The main goal is to get flu clinics operating at maximum capacity, Levy said. Within "a very few days," either the province will change the rules to include children of all ages or there will be such a large vaccine supply that there's no more need to have a priority system.</p>
<p>Levy called CHEO's decision to restrict access to the hospital a "very sensible" way to limit the spread of flu.</p>
<p>"Just over" 20 per cent of all Ottawa schools have absentee rates of more than 10 per cent, he said. That doesn't mean all those students have H1N1, but it's a strong suggestion.</p>
<p>Councillor Diane Deans is calling for clinics to admit children of all ages after the recent deaths of two children in Cornwall and Toronto.</p>
<p>"Personally, as a parent, I would like to see them add children, and that's my opinion," Deans said after the news conference.</p>
<p>"I actually had this discussion with Dr. Levy because I'm a parent, too, and you can't help hearing these horrific stories about children without any underlying illness suddenly dying," said Deans, who chairs the city's community and protective services committee.</p>
<p>"What we wanted to do in this first group was (to vaccinate) the people most at risk, and you have to kind of conclude that they must be at risk, especially in a school setting, so maybe they should be included."</p>
<p>To help limit the spread of the H1N1 virus, Ottawa-Carleton District School Board custodians are giving extra scrubs to classroom areas that are often touched, such as doorknobs, desktops, countertops and computers.</p>
<p>"Maintenance staff are concentrating on those areas more than floors, for example," board spokeswoman Sharlene Hunter said.</p>
<p>There is no additional cost, she said. "It's not extra hours, but a different focus.</p>
<p>"The message is we have to wash our hands, we have to cough into our sleeve," Hunter said. "When children are ill, they should stay home; if healthy, they should come to school.</p>
<p>"It is a community disease, not a school-related disease. We are taking precautions. We want healthy kids and healthy teachers," she said. "Principals are speaking to teachers on a daily basis. If any parents have concerns, they should speak to the principal."</p>
<p>The board is ready to set up flu-shot clinics in schools if asked. "We are working in collaboration with the health unit," Hunter said. "If they need our facilities, we will be there to assist them."</p>
<p>The Ottawa public health department requires school boards to report absenteeism above 10 per cent every day.</p>
<p>The board and health department will not publicly release names of schools with high absenteeism because it would cause "high anxiety," Hunter said, adding that the names would change daily and infection was not limited to schools.</p>
<p>At the Ottawa Catholic School Board, only two out of the board's 81 schools reported absentee rates of more than 10 per cent on Friday, deputy director of education Julian Hanlon said.</p>
<p>By Monday, that number had increased to 11 schools. As of late Tuesday, no final numbers had been reported, but Hanlon said the numbers were not out of the ordinary for flu season in general. It's impossible to say which absences are because of flu and which are for other reasons, such as sporting events and regular medical appointments, he said. "We're into the flu season. I'm sure these numbers will go up."</p>
<p>Hanlon said the board was ready to offer its schools as sites for clinics, both for students and the community in general. Schools are already the sites for mass vaccinations, such as the HPV shots for Grade 7 girls, and principals know the procedure for obtaining permission from parents. "We could ratchet up that kind of program in short order because we've done it in the past," he said.</p>
<p>Leaders representing some of the public board's unions expressed concerns about the measures taken by the board.</p>
<p>"We don't really buy that it's a community disease as opposed to a school issue," said Peter Giuliani, president of the Ottawa-Carleton Elementary Teachers' Federation. "Everybody talks about good consistent handwashing and social distancing, but you don't get that with little kids."</p>
<p>Of particular concern are schools such as the Crystal Bay Centre for Special Education or Clifford Bowie Public School, which serve students with physical and mental disabilities.</p>
<p>"You're handling the children all the time," Giuliani said. "They require assistance at all levels. You can say, 'Wash your hands,' but, within eight seconds, it's back in their nose. They're all in the same petrie dish."</p>
<p>Giuliani questioned whether custodians were able to keep schools exceptionally clean without additional funds from the province. "We have massive concerns for pregnant teachers," he said.</p>
<p>The union is in discussion with the board for alternative placements for teachers at high-risk, where H1N1 is identified or there is a high absenteeism rate.</p>
<p>Cindy Dubue, Ottawa-Carleton district president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, echoed the concern about high-risk employees such as pregnant women and those with respiratory ailments.</p>
<p>"At this point, the employer hasn't determined they will accommodate them," she said. "Our employer has said those people can take sick leave. We would rather have an alternative. There's no reason someone should use sick leave because a workplace is unsafe.</p>
<p>"We are asking teachers to keep a social distance. If students are ill, they should ensure proper procedures: an isolation area and having the parents called."</p>
<p>Dubue also expressed concern for educational assistants, who work closely with students with disabilities.</p>
<p>According to the board's pandemic plan, posted on its website, the board plans to keep schools open "for as long as it is safe to do so."</p>
<p>If safety becomes an issue, some or all schools may be closed, a decision of public health officials.</p>
<p>Schools are required to report absences of staff and students diagnosed with influenza or suspected cases of influenza.</p>
<p>"Based on a worst-case scenario, one-third of our employee group could potentially be ill due to a pandemic virus," the board memo said, noting there was a contingency staff plan.</p>
<p>Disruptions to normal activities are to be expected, including possible cancellation of field trips or pizza/hot dog days and after-school activities.</p>
<p>"Parents will decide whether or not to keep their children home from school if they perceive a possible threat to their children's health," the memo said.</p>
<p>Director of education Lyall Thomson said in an online letter to parents that students who displayed flu symptoms must remain at home until they were symptom-free for 24 hours. He urged parents to be ready to respond to calls from school to pick up sick children.</p>

</p>
<p>Anxious parents and their coughing, feverish children are flocking to CHEO, prompting the hospital to expand its emergency department, impose new restrictions on visitors, reduce service in three clinics and redeploy staff to the crowded emergency department.</p>
<p>On a typical October day, the emergency clinic sees 150 children, said Dr. Lindy Samson, head of infectious diseases and pandemic planning for the hospital. That figure has risen sharply in the past week, with 320 children appearing on Monday: two-thirds with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>That has created an "all hands on deck" situation, with staff from all over the hospital pitching in for long hours, but even that hasn't been enough, Samson said.</p>
<p>"Our wait times have increased, and there has sometimes been a shortage of seating in the emergency department," Samson said during a briefing Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>To manage the influx, CHEO is moving to the next stage of its H1N1 pandemic plan. On Tuesday, the hospital expanded its emergency clinic to create a separate isolation area for patients with flu-like symptoms. Service to gastroenterology, respirology and endocrinology clinics has been reduced to urgent cases only, and staff from those departments have been redeployed to the emergency clinic. Parents will receive calls telling them if their children's appointments are postponed.</p>
<p>"Every child that needs to be seen in any one of those (regular clinics) will still be seen," Samson said. "Where the child's regular clinical appointments can be deferred, we will do that until the level of H1N1 activity quiets down a bit."</p>
<p>To reduce the chance of infections among current patients, CHEO is limiting the number of visitors a patient can have to two parents or guardians only -- no friends or other relatives. In the emergency room, only one parent or guardian may accompany a child.</p>
<p>To help parents, the hospital is creating a hotline with recorded advice on assessing symptoms of H1N1 and expects to announce the phone number in the next few days.</p>
<p>"At this point in Ottawa, if it looks like influenza, it's H1N1. We don't have any seasonal flu circulating," Samson said. "Most children and youth and adults recover uneventfully at home with supportive care in seven to 10 days, sometimes a little bit before that. There are some who are getting much sicker than that. We can't at this point predict who will get sicker, but the severity of the disease, at this point, does not seem to be increasing."</p>
<p>In the past week, CHEO has had 49 per cent more patients than it normally does at this time of year. A "fair number" of those children could have been cared for at home or by primary-care doctors, Samson said, but that's not to say the danger from flu isn't real. As of Tuesday morning, there were 16 patients admitted to CHEO with confirmed or suspected cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>"We do have some children in the intensive-care unit," Samson said. "Everybody is on the way to recovery at this point."</p>
<p>CHEO is no longer testing patients for H1N1 unless they require admission to hospital.</p>
<p>"So the expectation that some people are coming to get the H1N1 test has to change," Samson said. "We will only test those who require admission to hospital."</p>
<p>Ottawa's public health department has shipped 3,500 doses of H1N1 vaccine to hospitals and the paramedic service to give to front-line health-care workers in their own work settings. That keeps doctors, nurses and paramedics from spending hours in line at public clinics.</p>
<p>If they do go to public clinics, those workers are supposed to be in an "expedited line," Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, said during a news conference.</p>

<p>The H1N1 is hitting Canadian workplaces as more people call in sick and employers beef up contingency plans.</p>
<p>Most larger employers, such as the big banks, are well prepared, particularly those that weathered the SARS outbreak in 2003.</p>
<p>It's a different story for smaller businesses with more limited resources, though.</p>
<p>Almost half of small business owners are unfamiliar with business continuity planning, and 80 per cent say preparing for potential disruptions is low on their to-do lists, a American Express survey showed last week.</p>
<p>Employees, too, are grappling with whether to call in sick – and potentially miss a week's pay – or show up for work, to the ire of their co-workers.</p>
<p>In Quebec, almost a quarter of employees say they would still show up for work even if they had the H1N1 flu virus, a poll commissioned by the Ordre des conseillers en resources humaines found this month.</p>
<p>Here's a temperature reading on what some employers in some sectors are doing, and what advisers are saying:.</p>
<p>Transport</p>
<p>Like many other large companies, Via Rail, which employs 3,000 people across the country, has shifted into high gear. Via's pandemic working group, which used to gather infrequently, now meets every 15 days to discuss the status of the swine flu outbreak, said spokeswoman Catherine Kaloutsky.</p>
<p>The company has run tests to simulate how it would run if 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent of its work force is missing. If absenteeism grows beyond 30 per cent, train service would be interrupted, it estimates.</p>
<p>Should the outbreak affect Toronto train lines, it plans to bring in workers from Vancouver to pitch in.</p>
<p>Banks</p>
<p>Bank of Nova Scotia has several tools to educate employees about swine flu. Like many large employers, its central intranet site gives employees contact information and links to public health agency websites. It sends out regular all-staff e-mails on the issue. And it's distributing a “flu flyer” – a brochure for staff with information on the flu.</p>
<p>Most big banks have a chief medical officer on staff to advise on pandemics and other health issues.</p>
<p>The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada, which oversees the banks, is asking institutions to review and update their business continuity plans.</p>
<p>Consultancies</p>
<p>Swine flu is causing many companies to bolster their telecommunication capabilities.</p>
<p>Workers at Toronto communications consulting firm Cohn & Wolfe are now equipped with laptops and BlackBerrys, so they can work from home. “It's accelerated plans for portable communication,” said Dave Gordon, executive vice president.</p>
<p>It has tested its technology to ensure that all of its 35 employees can now work offsite if need be.</p>
<p>The other change around the office? “A lot of people are saying ‘you know, the storeroom is out of Kleenex and Purell.' They notice that now and they wouldn't have before. And the employer wouldn't have been expected to stock it.”</p>
<p>Insurers</p>
<p>The insurance industry is monitoring developments “very closely” and is in contact with governments and public health agencies, says Wendy Hope, spokeswoman for Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association.</p>
<p>This week, the association added an H1N1 section to its website, which has links and will provide industry-specific information as it becomes available.</p>
<p>What lawyers say</p>
<p>Employment lawyers are being swamped with calls.</p>
<p>The main questions are whether an employer should pay a worker off sick for a week; how employers can encourage staff to stay home if sick; how to tell whether someone's legitimately ill, and how to set up a business so people can work remotely, says Janice Rubin, an employment lawyer at Toronto-based Rubin Thomlinson LLP.</p>
<p>Another potential worry is if an employee spreads rumours about the health status of a co-worker. “If there are rumours swirling around about you being sick and you infecting people, and it becomes impossible for you to come to work, that is theoretically a case of discrimination under the human rights code,” she cautions.</p>
<p>What doctors say</p>
<p>Employers: skip the doctor's note. That's the recent message from the Ontario Medical Association.</p>
<p>Doctors are asking employers to stop asking for a sick note from a physician as medical caseloads rise.</p>
<p>Rather, they should trust their employees. And employees shouldn't take advantage of this year's flu season to skip off work, it says.</p>
<p>“In order to help reduce the transmission of H1N1 and other illnesses, Ontario's doctors believe it is wise for patients to stay home when they have flu-like symptoms,” said Dr. Suzanne Strasberg, president of the association.</p>
<p>“Employers need to recognize that by requiring a sick note, they are encouraging those who are experiencing their worst symptoms and are most infectious to go out, when they should just be home in bed.”</p>

<p>Unpublished correction: The H1N1 vaccine contains a preservative with trace amounts of mercury, although the levels are lower than the organic mercury in a typical can of tuna and below recommended daily exposure limits. Per FL*** </p>
<p>Eleven of the 12 people in B.C. who died with the H1N1 flu had an underlying health condition but no one disease or ailment predominated, according to Travis Hottes, influenza epidemiologist with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Among those underlying conditions were diabetes, heart disease, asthma, immune suppression, lung disease and neurological diseases.</p>
<p>"It's generally people who have some condition that makes it difficult for their immune system to clear the virus," said Hottes.</p>
<p>The conditions are similar to what has been reported in other countries suffering deaths from H1N1.</p>
<p>- There are adequate numbers of ventilators in B.C. "for what we're projecting," said Health Ministry spokesman Ryan Jabs yesterday.</p>
<p>He said there were about 1,000 in the province. But when a new order of 25 arrives, only 433 of that total can be used to deal with H1N1.</p>
<p>Jabs said there were another 500 ventilators that the federal government can ship to any major centre within 24 hours and to anywhere in the country within 48 hours.</p>
<p>- The vaccine cannot cause flu and is 80 to 95 per cent effective.</p>
<p>- The H1N1 vaccine does not contain mercury.</p>
<p>- H1N1 is not worse than the regular flu for most people. A flu includes a fever (of 38 C or higher), shaking and chills, severe muscle aches, headaches and coughing. H1N1 can also be marked by a shortness of breath. If that is the case, seek medical attention.</p>
<p>- 95 per cent of those who get H1N1 will get it from airborne droplets spread by infected people, likely through coughs.</p>
<p>- What's the point of getting vaccinated if most people will be fine after a few days sick in bed?, is one common question. "The fear is that many people will get sick around the same time," said Ariel Fenster, a chemistry professor at McGill University. "Imagine if all at once there weren't enough nurses or bus drivers, for example."</p>
<p>- The flu generally has a six-week time frame to do its worst. The H1N1 season is here, and it could last weeks or months longer than the regular flu season.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- A question about pregnant women and the H1N1 vaccine provoked a bizarre bout of heckling and laughter on the Tory benches in the Commons on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, a physician and former public health minister, was shouted down when she tried to raise the issue of confusion surrounding what kind of vaccinations pregnant women should be getting.</p>
<p>Bennett initially couldn't finish her question, overcome by roars of derision and mockery from the Conservative backbenches.</p>
<p>"This is not funny," Bennett protested.</p>
<p>The noise eventually died down enough for her to pose her questions, which revolved around whether pregnant women should get the vaccine with or without "adjuvant" - a substance added to the vaccine to stretch supply and boost immunity.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq replied that both vaccines were safe for pregnant women and the government was taking the issue "very seriously."</p>
<p>The heckling left Bennett shaken.</p>
<p>I "just was astounded," she told reporters after question period. "I don't know why these people think it's funny or whether it's just offensive or what it is. ... They were just heckling and laughing."</p>
<p>Bennett said the confusion is real, and frightening to many pregnant women in Canada.</p>

</p>
<p>Thirteen-year-old Evan Frustaglio was scared of getting the flu.</p>
<p>After the hockey player's death Monday from the H1N1 virus - just three days after he began complaining of symptoms - one painful memory gnaws at his father, Paul.</p>
<p>"We told him it was all okay," he said of their family chats last spring when the first wave of the virus hit.</p>
<p>Like many parents, the Frustaglios tried to allay his fears.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, public health officials confirmed Evan's death was due to H1N1 complications. After earlier stating Evan had a mild case of asthma, Toronto Public Health later said that was not true; it was "an error we regret."</p>
<p>When Evan had a sore throat and dry cough at a hockey tournament in London on the weekend, he was told by doctors and pharmacists it was a simple flu or seasonal cold. He was sent home from a Toronto walk-in clinic on Sunday, and told to take Tylenol.</p>
<p>"I would have brought my son to the hospital," Frustaglio said. "It gave us a false sense of security."</p>
<p>On Monday morning, he said, his son looked better.</p>
<p>Evan took a bath, his dad helped dry him off, and he went to lie down in his bedroom. His father left the room to call the doctor, and when he returned five minutes later, he found his son unconscious on the bathroom rug.</p>
<p>"We called 911, and brought him to the hospital, and now he's gone," said Frustaglio, struggling to stay composed.</p>
<p>Vaughan Councillor Joyce Frustaglio, whose husband is the first cousin of the boy's father, said the family "is very closely knit. This tragedy will leave a mark on everyone," she said from her office.</p>
<p>"I was always Auntie Joyce. He was a respectful, kind and happy child, with a sense of humour. He loved life and he loved hockey."</p>
<p>Toronto's medical officer of health, Dr. David McKeown, said he couldn't speculate on what might have happened if Evan went to hospital on Sunday, but advised parents to keep children at home, know what symptoms to look for, and consult with a doctor if symptoms become worrisome.</p>
<p>"This does not mean there is a higher risk of severe illness for anyone who may have been in contact with him," McKeown said.</p>
<p>At a shared news conference with McKeown, Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, called Evan's death a "very rare occurrence." She said 28 people have died of H1N1 complications in Ontario since April.</p>
<p>Mississauga North Stars coach Al Reisman said members of his hockey team are worried.</p>
<p>"Everyone I talked to said, 'I was there, I was with Evan.'" All of the boys swam in the pool together, went to the hot tub and shared water bottles at a tournament in London this weekend, he said.</p>
<p>Reisman said the team captain has been quarantined until Friday and another player is taking Tamiflu.</p>
<p>The Frustaglio family has also been prescribed Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Evan's school, Hill Academy in Vaughan, was closed Tuesday but will reopen Wednesday "informally," said CEO Peter Merrill.</p>
<p>In addition to playing most of the school's sports, Evan was one of the driving forces that brought hockey to his school, said vice-principal Rocco Coluccio.</p>

</p>
<p>People die of the flu. This is no consolation to the family of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio, the Toronto boy who died Monday, apparently after contracting swine flu. But it is true.</p>
<p>This was so before this latest pandemic. It will almost certainly continue to be so in the future. But it is no reason to go off the deep end.</p>
<p>Keep things in perspective. What is worrisome about this particular strain, sometimes known as Novel Swine-origin Influenza A (H1N1), is its newness. We know, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, that is contains genes from pigs, humans and birds. We know from experience that such a mix gives it the potential to pass back and forth between species and to become particularly virulent.</p>
<p>Which is presumably one reason why the public health establishment is so fixated on swine flu. The other reason may that world governments are using this pandemic as a test run to see how they would respond to a real crisis.</p>
<p>But what we also know is that, so far, this flu strain has been no more serious than any other.</p>
<p>To put it another way: Before the H1N1 scare, the death from flu of a 13-year-old boy wouldn't have led newscasts across the nation.</p>
<p>Consider the facts.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, fewer than 5,000 people have died around the globe from this variant of swine flu. In any normal year, influenza causes between 250,000 and 500,000 deaths worldwide.</p>
<p>In the Southern Hemisphere, the winter flu season is now over. In spite of dire predictions, only 185 people died from swine flu in Australia - considerably fewer than the roughly 3,000 who succumb to seasonal influenza in that country each year.</p>
<p>And no, it wasn't because the population was immunized. Australia's vaccination campaign against swine flu took off last month.</p>
<p>Last week, U.S. President Barack Obama declared swine flu a national emergency after about 1,000 Americans died. Yet according to the Centers for Disease Control, roughly 50,000 Americans die every year from seasonal flu - without any politician paying much attention.</p>
<p>What does seem to be true, according to early statistics, is that this particular strain is harder on people in the prime of their lives. Common flu strains tend to hit the very young and very old.</p>
<p>In that sense, the real novelty of this novel H1N1 strain may be that it is killing the wrong people.</p>
<p>For those youngish and middle-aged people who tend to dominate both politics and the media, this is understandably worrying.</p>
<p>What's more unnerving, however, is the level of hype surrounding this flu virus, hype that at times comes dangerously close to hysteria.</p>
<p>The public health dictum suggesting that people wash their hands to prevent the virus' spread has transformed itself, in some areas (like the Catholic Archdiocese of Ottawa) into a near-ban on shaking hands.</p>
<p>Demand for hand sanitizers has exploded, as individuals and institutions search for ways to make physical contact safe.</p>
<p>Yet experts are divided over handwashing. A 2007 study done for the Public Health Agency of Canada and chaired by Toronto microbiologist Donald Low concluded that the practice does little to prevent flu transmission, largely because this particular virus is airborne.</p>
<p>Polls show that the public is taking a casual attitude toward swine flu. This alarms those beating the H1N1 drum. But given the actual evidence, maybe the public is onto something.</p>
<p>Thomas Walkom's column appears Wednesday and Saturday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The new National loses reality; The CBC news flagship is fast-paced and flashy, but the tight show feels like a rehearsed drama</b>

</p>
<p>CBC-TV's revamped news flagship The National bowed in Monday night, flashing new graphics, a glitzy, wide-open set, a faster pace, a larger reporting crew.</p>
<p>Its now unseated anchor, Peter Mansbridge, plays a cross between a wandering, gracious maitre d' and - when he's standing behind the new Plexiglas counter - an avuncular publican pressing messengers to unburden themselves.</p>
<p>Gone is the pomp and circumstance of old, the age-soaked wisdom the national broadcaster oozed at 10 p.m., with Mansbridge as chief pooh-bah, the steel-jawed herd boss who once commanded a far-reaching news empire bound by the red and white of the nation's flag and by the sobriety and authority it represents.</p>
<p>Monday night, The National revealed new colours - cool variations of blue throbbing incessantly on giant screens that surround the massive set, complete with constantly shifting graphics designed to impress viewers with the urgency and immediacy, the fundamental here-and-nowness of the mother corp.'s new enterprise.</p>
<p>It's too early to judge whether the program is short-changing us with news of substance, but the lingering impression is of compression and pace at all costs.</p>
<p>An awful lot of little bits seemed to be packaged into the new National's 55 minutes:</p>
<p>Gasping reports on the H1N1 lineups in different cities on the first day of inoculation.</p>
<p>Adrienne Arsenault in London soliciting a demonstration of British upper-class umbrage over the fact a new report indicates four out of five Canadians don't give a hoot about the royal family.</p>
<p>Wendy Mesley's cheeky vignette suggesting drug companies and doctors just might be making money on the swine flu scare.</p>
<p>No one item seemed more pressing than another. Nothing hit hard.</p>
<p>That may be because the new, centralized, multi-platform CBC news system is still getting its bearings. With so many to serve - the all-news network CBC NN (formerly Newsworld), the main TV network and local outlets, CBC Radio news, the CBC news website and downloadable versions of The National - The Hub, the key new assignment desk, may need time to fine-tune, to prioritize.</p>
<p>It may also be that reporters and host Mansbridge are a little overexcited with their impressive new circumstances and crackling format. There was certainly a breathless, first-date ambience to Monday night's debut, and a few smirks.</p>
<p>What doesn't sit well, however, is the surreal, theatrical nature of the new National.</p>
<p>It's less a news program than a piece of rehearsed drama. Characters step up to their marks to speak a part, such as retired general Rick Hillier, who bellied up to Mansbridge's pristine bar to deliver a broadside about Ottawa's ineffectiveness in backing up Canadian Forces in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>What The National has gained in speed and visual wallop seems to be at the expense of the appearance of reality. It was all a little, sad to say, self-satisfied and contrived.</p>

</p>
<p>Confronted with a surge in flu cases that included the death of a healthy 13-year-old boy, Toronto Public Health officials will start giving shots to the public Thursday - four days earlier than planned.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio, a minor hockey player, was found unconscious in his bathroom Monday, just three days after he first complained of a sore throat and a dry cough.</p>
<p>The teen's sudden death sparked a flurry of concern. Among the hundreds who lined up for vaccinations in Whitby were dozens who said the news about Frustaglio prompted them to get their children immunized quickly. Some doctors' phone lines were going straight to an answering machine that said the offices were overwhelmed by H1N1-related calls; the messages redirected patients to public health.</p>
<p>And some minor hockey teams reconsidered cherished traditions: the shared water bottle, the post-game handshake.</p>
<p>But despite the teen's death, preteens won't be added to the list of "priority groups" to get advance immunization against the virus, said Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, at a news conference.</p>
<p>"The sequencing has been established ... clearly the younger people are experiencing a higher burden of illness, but by and large it doesn't result in serious complications. This (death) is rare, this is a very rare occurrence."</p>
<p>In the lineup outside the Whitby clinic was Joanna Lawrence and her 5-year-old son.</p>
<p>"I was a little bit hesitant until today," she said. "The safety of our children, our loved ones, comes first and there's really not enough time to wait for additional research and take that chance."</p>
<p>Nissa Belmonte, also waiting, said the death "jolted a lot of people into thinking about" getting immunized.</p>
<p>Around 6 p.m., a clinic employee advised people at the back of the line to leave, saying they would probably not get in by the 8 p.m. closing time.</p>
<p>"The second wave of H1N1 flu is most definitely upon us," King said Tuesday. "It's only the end of October and we're already seeing the numbers we usually experience at the peak of the flu season."</p>
<p>Public clinics in York, Peel and Halton will open Wednesday, Toronto facilities on Thursday. While the city had planned to immunize only frontline workers this week, the clinics will accept "priority groups" - people with chronic medical conditions younger than 65, healthy children from six months to five years old, people who provide care to at-risk persons who cannot be immunized, health-care workers and pregnant women.</p>
<p>Tuula Katz of Thornhill, whose 11-year-old son also plays minor hockey, said Frustaglio's death had made her reconsider her reluctance to instruct her son to get the shot.</p>
<p>"If you'd asked me last week, I'd have told you I wasn't going to get him vaccinated," she said. "It hit a little too close to home."</p>
<p>Still, some parents say there is no chance they will get their children vaccinated.</p>
<p>"To me, if the disease does not get you, the vaccine will. So pick your poison," said Fabiola Hernandez.</p>
<p>The Etobicoke woman, who has a 13-year-old daughter and 6-year-old son, said she is building up her children's immune systems naturally. They don't participate in any after-school activities such as hockey or swimming, but even if they did, she said she wouldn't pull them out over H1N1 concerns.</p>
<p>Yet several Greater Toronto Hockey League coaches said they plan to be more vigilant in enforcing health policies.</p>
<p>David Cook, coach of a Toronto Penguins peewee team, said he would ensure his players were drinking from their own water bottles. Eddie Choi, a North York Rangers coach who also runs a hockey school, said he would lecture players on cleanliness and prohibit post-game handshakes. From now on, he said, he will ask them to bump fists - with their gloves on.</p>
<p>"This was a huge wake-up call for the hockey community," Choi said.</p>
<p>Public health units are keeping an eye on absentee rates at schools.</p>
<p>At six Toronto public schools, more than 10 per cent of students are absent with flu-like symptoms. Other GTA school boards are also reporting higher-than-normal absentee numbers.</p>
<p>"It's hard to tell if you're dealing with absenteeism due to illness or absenteeism because of fear of illness," said Ross Virgo, spokesperson for the York Region District School Board.</p>
<p>Health officials dismissed the idea of closing schools to curb transmission. Teachers can enforce hand washing and other preventative measures, they said.</p>
<p>In Peel schools, any student with flu-like symptoms will be sequestered until someone can pick them up, board spokesman Brian Woodland said.</p>

</p>
<p>Pricey fight for H1N1</p>
<p>THE fights against H1N1 flu will cost the Winnipeg Region Health Authority "tens of millions of dollars" not budgeted for in 2009-10, said the health authority's outgoing president, Brian Postl.</p>
<p>Money is being spent to expand intensive-care units and for buying equipment like ventilators, intravenous pumps, monitors, defibrillators and dialysis machines, he said.</p>
<p>Extra staffing has been needed for higher patient loads and more full intensive-care units. The WRHA expects the provincial government is going to help pay those costs. "I hope so," Postl said.</p>
<p>The increased expenditures follow on the heels of a $4-million deficit announced yesterday at the health authority's annual meeting. Postl said the deficit is from higher patient volumes than anticipated.</p>
<p>Salaries make up 73 per cent of WRHA costs.</p>
<p>Postl said the deficit amounts to less than one per cent of the WRHA's $2 billion budget.</p>
<p>"In many sectors, if your finances are within one per cent of your budget base, you're pretty successful," he said. The health authority's last deficit was four years ago.</p>
<p>Postl also commented on the seemingly healthy 13-year-old Toronto boy who died from H1N1 on Monday.</p>
<p>"That's why we keep telling people to get vaccinated. It's very unpredictable who's going to be severely affected. When it happens to young people it's especially tragic," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WRHA sets up Siloam clinic -</b>

</p>
<p>THE down and out along Main Street got a hot breakfast Tuesday morning at the Siloam Mission and followed it with a shot of H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority worked with Siloam to set up a clinic, one of a possible 30 such clinics the WRHA will hold specifically for disadvantaged and homeles.</p>
<p>"I was beat up pretty bad a couple of weeks ago and I figured with the shape I'm in right now, if I get (H1N1), I'd probably be dead," Maxie Arnott, 59, said after he was the first at Siloam to get the shot.</p>
<p>The clinic is part of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority initiative to counter the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We know the virus is in Winnipeg and if we can get enough people vaccinated, we believe we can keep the number of infected people down," Dr. Sande Harlos, a WRHA medical officer of health, said.</p>
<p>The WRHA had run similar clinics across the city for the seasonal flu in locations close to the city's disadvantaged and approached those spots again when the H1N1 virus became available.</p>
<p>"We jumped at the opportunity to have the clinic here," Kari Enns, director of Siloam Missions's Saul Sair Health Centre, said.</p>
<p>About 95 people received H1N1 vaccines at Siloam Mission by 2 p.m., when the WRHA moved the clinic one block north to the Union Gospel Mission.</p>
<p>The WRHA hopes to immunize between 300 and 500 disadvantaged people weekly.</p>

<p>Another beacon</p>
<p>Robert Galston's assertion (Union tower a beacon for downtown, Oct. 25) that the Union tower's revival will be a beacon for downtown renewal is absolutely correct. Red River College deserves praise for its inspiring plans to transform this historic skyscraper into a dynamic student residence, educational and retail centre, as well as for the current Princess Street Campus.</p>
<p>However, Galston's suggestion that the University of Winnipeg has not had a "good effect" on the local community is not only dead wrong; it completely ignores the facts. If Galston actually took the time to walk south of Ellice Avenue today, he would see community renewal in action: a vibrant, pedestrian mall on Spence Street and a front lawn teeming with students, faculty and local residents alike; a basketball court regularly used by children and youth from the local neighbourhood; a brand new building called McFeetors Hall, home not only to nearly 200 students, but dozens of families from the local community, and a new day care centre -- one of the largest in Manitoba -- serving children not only of students, but from the community as well. On the north side of Ellice, he would see the Helen Betty Osborne building, home to the Wii Chi Waakanak learning centre (a community computer lab) and the Global Welcome Centre for immigrants and refugees, many of whom live in the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>Galston says that "only by understanding the nature of urban environments and how people use them can renewal projects lend themselves to their surroundings." I could not agree more. That is why I invite Galston to come to the U of W campus to actually see with his own eyes this notion in action.</p>

<p>Queue jumping?</p>
<p>I saw on the Free Press website a photo of Brian Postl, the big cheese of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, getting the H1N1 vaccine. I can understand this if he is in the vulnerable categories, but if he by-passed the people who really need it first because he is the head of the WRHA, this would make the who-needs-it-first list meaningless. Is he on the priority list of the vulnerable or did he get it because of his position? Someone should ask the WRHA this question.</p>

<p>Focus on criminals</p>
<p>Darcy Brooks wrote (Bad math on guns, Oct. 23) "one cannot help but conclude that in terms of lives potentially lost, the cost of scrapping the long-gun registry would be much too high."</p>
<p>Why do the words "pre-crime" and "thought-crime" immediately come to mind? The problem with people like Brooks is that they've forgotten that laws are meant to punish the people who actually do commit a crime, not the ones who might commit one.</p>
<p>What Brooks is telling us is that focusing on a potential crime that may or may not ever happen sometime in the foggy future is more important than dealing with the crimes that are actually being committed every day.</p>
<p>How about instead of fighting to maintain a useless database that keeps lists of the law-abiding, Brooks turns some of that energy towards lobbying for laws that actually focus on the criminals?</p>

<p>Unfair fabrications</p>
<p>It is very upsetting to see the Free Press publish articles by the Frontier Centre which always contain incorrect and misleading information to push a wacko far-right agenda. A few weeks ago the centre stated that Alberta pays out twice as much money for automobile insurance claims as Manitoba. What wasn't stated was that Alberta has nearly three times the population of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Recently they stated that the spread between public servants' and private sector employees' wages in Manitoba is the highest in Canada. What the centre fails to state is that private sector wages in Manitoba are among the lowest in Canada and that public sector wages are well below many provinces. For example, the average Manitoba teacher's wage is 15 to 20 per cent below the average Ontario teacher's.</p>
<p>Although I disagree with the Frontier Centre on most issues, in a free society they have the right to express their views but I wish they would stop twisting the truth to make their points.</p>

<p>Funding for all Canadians?</p>
<p>I was happy to read that another focus for the Canadian Human Rights Museum was on children. The museum's latest newsletter reads "Each region of the country will be consulted to ensure that the development of the Canadian Museum for Human Rights is representative of all Canadians." Bravo! I take from this that they will also be speaking for those who cannot speak for themselves, primarily the thousands of Canadian unborn human beings that are losing their lives every day from abortion. If the museum can confirm this fact with me I would be very pleased to help in its funding.</p>

<p>Friendly Manitoba! Since a few days ago, there is no more free parking on Saturday around our building. This is a seniors' residence and many people have visitors on weekends. Now there are new payboxes and you have to pay on Saturday along Assiniboine, Fort, Garry and Navy -- is that friendly? Is it good for downtown business?</p>

<p>Dirty buses</p>
<p>Re: Transit due for a cleaning (Oct. 26). Let me congratulate Michael Thompson on his one day excursion on a bus. On his trip he noticed the filth on the bus, empty sign boards, and floors that looked like they hadn't been washed for weeks. If Thompson had taken the bus more than once, he might also have noticed drunks on buses, abusive behaviour ignored by the bus driver, and low floor bus ramps not in working order while bus drivers refused to lift them down manually.</p>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, the fare collection system is being updated and "smart cards" are being implemented by the end of 2009!</p>
<p>So, while spending millions of dollars on transit improvements may be important and necessary, it won't make any difference if the buses aren't kept clean and safe for those using them.</p>

<p>From hopping the bus to extending a hand, an early symptom of the swine flu pandemic is the change it is bringing to social behaviour. Afraid to get it, and worried about spreading it, families, workplaces and community groups are making new, no-flu rules.</p>
<p>Sports</p>
<p>At the end of the game, win or lose, minor league hockey players have been told to keep their gloves on and wave at their opponents from the blue line. So far, tournaments are going ahead as planned, but Hockey Canada coaches are ensuring players don't share water bottles, and keep their gear separate in the locker room. Andy Ives, who is a trainer for his nine-year-old son's house league team and co-ordinator for the men's league in Manotick, Ont., says one adult player even proposed a ban on spitting while on the bench. England's Health Protection Agency is one step ahead of that: They've issued a notice to soccer players warning that spitting could cause the spread of infection and players should avoid doing so. Similar care is being taken at the Olympics this winter, where athletes are already being coached to do the “elbow bump” when greeting fellow competitors.</p>
<p>Kids</p>
<p>Some U.S. schools have suspended their perfect attendance prizes to encourage students to stay home when they are sick. And while Halloween is still on the calendar for most families, some parents say they have started avoiding playgroups and restaurants, and more closely monitoring illnesses when their children do go for play dates. Rachel Riordan, a Toronto-based illustrator who works at home with her two-year-old twins, says she has cancelled sandbox visits at the park and music classes. “My kids will stick anything in their mouths – to my horror.”</p>
<p>Greetings</p>
<p>At business meetings, churches, parties and university convocations, the friendly handshake is disappearing – never mind the double-cheeked kiss. More churches have stopped passing the peace for fear of also passing along the virus, relying on bows and nods to spread well-wishes. At the University of Ottawa's convocation last weekend, there were curtseys and Obama fist bumps – but old-fashioned palm-pressing was not permitted. As university president Allan Rock, a former federal minister of health, told the audience: “We still have to communicate our sense of joy….So here are some ideas for you: You can wink or you can nod or you can wave or you can salute.”</p>
<p>Public transit</p>
<p>Muffle those coughs, or brace for dirty looks. In Victoria this month, an elderly woman asked a passenger to get off the bus when she coughed into her sleeve. (She did not have the H1N1 virus.) “We're developing war regulations around public displays of ill health,” says Victoria city Councillor Philippe Lucas, who thinks buses should carry hand sanitizer for passengers.</p>
<p>Work</p>
<p>Sniffling employees increasingly find themselves caught between the pressure to show up and the insistence of wary co-workers that they stay home. Last week, when Catherine Kaloutsky, a spokeswoman for Via Rail, coughed at the office – just to clear her throat – it was enough to rattle her colleagues. “Quite literally, everybody around me said, ‘Are you sick? Do you think you're sick, because you should go home. We don't want you here,' ” she recounts. Workers at the Toronto communications consulting firm <span class="companylink">Cohn & Wolfe</span> are now equipped with laptops and BlackBerrys so they can work from home. “It's accelerated plans for portable communication,” says Dave Gordon, executive vice-president. In some workplaces, the measures are more informal: One employee at a career counselling centre in Brockville, Ont., comes in early each day to wipe down all the doorknobs and countertops.</p>

</p>
<p>Paul Frustaglio sat on the front step of his Etobicoke home yesterday still stunned to find himself accepting condolences for his son's death.</p>
<p>It had all happened so quickly. On Saturday, his 13-year-old son Evan was sick with the flu, but still playing hockey. By Monday morning, Mr. Frustaglio was holding his son's limp body in his arms, trying frantically to revive him.</p>
<p>After patiently giving dozens of interviews, the grief finally overwhelmed him. As he embraced a friend outside his home, he let out a long, painful cry that echoed along the quiet suburban street.</p>
<p>“My boy is gone,” he said. “My God, my baby. He's gone.”</p>
<p>He described his son as an independent free spirit and a leader among his peers. He was a hard-charging hockey player who nicknamed himself “Evan the edge,” and who until this year had always worn the 93 jersey in tribute to Doug Gilmour.</p>
<p>Evan attended Hill Academy, a school with a sports emphasis, in Vaughan, and played hockey for the Mississauga North Stars.</p>
<p>It was at a hockey tournament in London, Ont., over the weekend that he fell ill. A classmate said Evan had complained of a sore back late last week. By the time he and his mother, a registered nurse, arrived in London Friday night, he was feeling worse. He played brilliantly in the game that night, but the next morning his back pain intensified and he developed a sore throat and fever. His coach, Al Reisman, said Evan was held out of long stretches during his two games Saturday, but was still among the team's best players.</p>
<p>His mother went to a pharmacy in London that day. The pharmacist recommended some over-the-counter medications for his sore throat and pain.</p>
<p>Evan called his father that night, angry that his team had been knocked out of the tournament. His father, who runs an endoscopy clinic, was coaching Evan's 10-year-old brother's team and couldn't make it to London to see him play. After dinner, Evan's illness worsened. He vomited during the night. His mother decided to pack up and return to Toronto at 4:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Around 2 p.m., she took him to a walk-in clinic at the Six Points plaza in Etobicoke. The clinic is an MCI Doctor's Office, part of a chain of clinics in Ontario, Alberta and B.C. Evan vomited while he waited to be seen.</p>
<p>“The doctor said his lungs are fine and that he's breathing okay. He's got slight redness in his throat. But he didn't feel at this juncture there was any reason to prescribe any medications like antibiotics or Tamiflu,” Mr. Frustaglio said.</p>
<p>Evan continued to vomit overnight. By Monday morning, he was feeling a little better. Around 11 a.m., he asked his father to draw him a bath.</p>
<p>“I just wasn't happy with the way he took the bath. He went from him being reasonable in the morning to lethargic. He had a sort of heat rash on his leg. I said I don't like that. Father's intuition, I just didn't feel good about it,” he said.</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Mr. Frustaglio was about to dial his family doctor when he heard the patter of his son's feet returning to the bathroom.</p>
<p>I said, “Evan where are you going? And he said, “I'm just going to the bathroom, Dad.” I said, ‘You okay?' and he said, “Yeah, I'm okay.”</p>
<p>Mr. Frustaglio walked downstairs to find Evan curled up on the floor. At first he thought he was trying to ease his fever on the cool, marble tile. He tried to help his son to his feet.</p>
<p>“I start picking him up and he collapses. And that's it,” his father said, fighting back tears. “The way he collapsed in my arms, he had nothing. His body just went limp.”</p>
<p>Paramedics arrived within minutes to rush Evan to hospital, but he never regained consciousness.</p>
<p>He is the sixth child to die in Ontario of H1N1 influenza since April. Toronto Public Health said he also suffered from mild asthma, but what's shocked many observers is how quickly he died. He was an otherwise healthy boy and an excellent athlete with no serious underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>His coach, Mr. Reisman, said his teammates are devastated. At least two of them are also in quarantine, and Mr. Reisman said he has fallen ill with flu, though he doesn't know if it's H1N1.</p>
<p>A distraught Mr. Frustaglio said he doesn't know how he'll get by without his son, whom he called his best friend.</p>
<p>“Every day was a memory with my son,” he said. “Me waking him up, driving him to school, saying goodbye. Him calling me during the day, why am I late from work, hurry up and get home I'm waiting for you, Dad. Everywhere I went he called me. I talked to my kid a thousand times a day.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>EVAN'S FINAL DAYS</p>
<p>Friday: Evan had been complaining of a sore back, a classmate said. He travelled with his mother to a hockey tournament where he scored the opening goal and got two assists. He developed a sore throat that night.</p>
<p>Saturday: Evan complained of soreness and showed some mild flu symptoms. He still scored a goal and two assists. After dinner his condition worsened. He vomited several times.</p>
<p>Sunday: After Evan vomited through the night, he and his mother left London and visited an Etobicoke walk-in clinic around 2 p.m. The doctor said his lungs and breathing were fine and there was redness in his throat, Evan's father said. The doctor advised over-the-counter medication.</p>
<p>Monday: Evan's fever and soreness seemed to improve, although he vomited several times overnight. Around 11 a.m., Evan curled up on the bathroom floor and went limp. He was rushed to hospital and never regained consciousness. Joe Friesen</p>

<p>VANCOUVER -- A prisoner in a federal penitentiary in B.C. with the H1N1 virus has been placed in an isolated hospital unit, but so far correctional officers have seen no sign that the virus is spreading through the tightly confined prison system, a union official said yesterday.</p>
<p>The prisoner is in an institution in Abbotsford, Gord Robertson, Pacific regional president of the Union of Canadian Correctional Officers, said in an interview.</p>
<p>The privacy law restricts information that can be released about the prisoner, Mr. Robertson said. But he revealed that sheriffs wearing masks and gloves recently brought the prisoner from a provincial detention centre to a prison hospital equipped with specialized facilities to handle those with contagious illnesses.</p>
<p>“I think it will be an isolated case, because he just came from the province,” Mr. Robertson said. “It's not really a huge issue for us.”</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson said he anticipated that correctional officers in the federal prisons will have the option of having the H1N1 vaccination around the same time as the prisoners or shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>Caroline McNicoll, a spokewoman for Correctional Service Canada, confirmed that one federal inmate with H1N1 is in isolation in a hospital.</p>
<p>“The inmate is stable and being monitored,” she stated in an e-mail response to a request for information about the H1N1 flu situation in prisons.</p>
<p>She also said that many federal inmates in federal institutions are among those groups that have priority for the vaccinations.</p>
<p>“We will work with local public health authorities to ensure appropriate access to H1N1 vaccines,” she stated.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, the B.C. government announced that three more people in the province have died from the virus in the past week, raising the total of confirmed deaths from H1N1 to 12.</p>
<p>Eleven of those people had underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>One person, who died about 2½ weeks ago, was completely healthy before contacting the H1N1 virus, said an official with the B.C. Minister of Healthy Living and Sport who was not authorized to be quoted in the media.</p>
<p>Also, the number of new, severe cases has jumped significantly in the past week.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has identified 199 severe cases since April, with 88 of those confirmed since Oct. 20. Twenty-one of the 88 infected patients were admitted to intensive-care units.</p>
<p>“It's a jump [in the number of cases], but it is what the province has been preparing for,” the official said. B.C. was the first province in Canada to see a resurgence of H1N1 this fall, he said. “This is the expected ramp-up.”</p>
<p>Health officials anticipate the number of cases has not yet peaked, he added, but authorities will likely not pinpoint the peak until after it has passed.</p>
<p>In Vancouver yesterday, the lineups for flu shots were considerably shorter than on Monday, the first day the vaccinations were available for pregnant women, those under 65 with chronic conditions and those living in remote and isolated communities.</p>
<p>Dozens of people were turned away Monday from a flu-shot clinic. Anna Marie D'Angelo, a spokeswoman for Vancouver Coastal Health, said the clinic extended its hours to deal with 120 people lined up for shots at closing time. But others were told to return the next day.</p>
<p>Not all of those who were turned away were among the priority group that qualified for flu shots this week, she said, adding that a lot of people are confused by the process that provides flu shots first to those most at risk.</p>
<p>About 100 people were waiting for the clinic to open yesterday morning. But by mid-morning, the line was down to around 10 people.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, those eligible to receive the vaccine will include children under five years old, health-care workers and infant-care providers. The vaccine is expected to be available to anyone who wants it by mid-November.</p>

The fear is real but the flu's risk is small, public health reporter André Picard writes. So what should anxious parents do? Get their kids vaccinated and keep up their daily routines</b>

</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>The deaths of two young, previously healthy children are bound to terrify families, and to ramp up the fear related to H1N1 influenza several notches. Many parents are now wondering: Should they keep their kids home from school, should they keep them away from hockey practice and gymnastics and should they – horror of horrors – put the kibosh on Halloween? The answer to those questions is no – an equivocal no.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean that there is no risk, of course. The chances of contracting H1N1 are relatively high, and it is estimated that, by the time all is said and done, as many as one in three Canadians could be afflicted by the disease. Still, that is only slightly higher than seasonal flu.</p>
<p>While H1N1 flu is unpleasant, only a fraction of the infected will get so sick that they require hospitalization, and fewer still will die. But because the denominator is so large, a lot of severely ill people will be in intensive care in the coming weeks, and the deaths will be counted in the hundreds, perhaps thousands.</p>
<p>Statistics, of course, are abstract. The deaths of those two children – their stories and photos splashed across the front page of newspapers and on TV newscasts – are painfully and frighteningly real.</p>
<p>What is difficult is putting this risk in context so that it is meaningful.</p>
<p>In 21st century Canada, risk is a largely unfamiliar concept. In a country of 34 million people that has nearly 400,000 births annually, fewer than 800 children aged 1-14 die each year. (Another 1,200 or so under the age of 1 die, most of congenital abnormalities.) In Canada, the greatest danger to children is falls and motor vehicle collisions. Deaths from infectious disease are remarkably few, in large part due to vaccination.</p>
<p>Yet the H1N1 vaccine is hard to come by, even for high priority groups such as children. And while mass immunization campaigns are rolling out across the nation, the lines are frustratingly long.</p>
<p>So, what should parents do?</p>
<p>First and foremost, they should bite the bullet and get their children vaccinated. Pack a book, a GameBoy, and an iPod and get in line.</p>
<p>Stand in line and relish the thought that we live in a country where one of the greatest threats to our children is a bug with a relatively small risk. And don't forget that the risks of the vaccine itself are vanishingly small.</p>
<p>Paradoxically, the lineups for the vaccine are creating huge gatherings, something that should be avoided during an outbreak of disease.</p>
<p>But this risk too has to be kept in context.</p>
<p>The best and most reasoned information on the matter comes from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, which has published a document entitled “Guidance for State and Local Public Health Officials and School Administrators for School (K-12) Responses to Influenza.”</p>
<p>The guidelines say, essentially, that there is no point closing schools, except in circumstances where there are huge numbers of infected students and staff. (Similar reasoning applies to other community activities such as sports and trick-or-treating.) What the CDC says is that individual children (and adults) should stay home if they are sick to avoid infecting others. But closing schools only creates alternate gathering places, such as malls and makeshift daycares.</p>
<p>The CDC also says that when children (and adults) are out and about, they should practise hand hygiene and etiquette to minimize the spread of germs. Only in rare instances should activities be cancelled.</p>
<p>In other words, life can and should go on during flu season.</p>
<p>Isolation and quarantine are not very effective public health measures on a large scale. They don't substantially reduce the risk of the spread of disease and they greatly increase panic and fear.</p>
<p>After all, what is risk?</p>
<p>The dictionary definition is: “The possibility of suffering harm or loss: danger.”</p>
<p>A more modern and timely definition comes from Peter Sandman, a professor at Rutgers University and the guru of risk management, and the creator of the formula “Risk = Hazard + Outrage.”</p>
<p>We know, in a mathematical way, the risk of H1N1 influenza: low but still significant. What is more difficult to measure is outrage, or fear.</p>
<p>When children die, fear rises in an exponential manner.</p>
<p>If nothing else, the tragic deaths of Evan Frustaglio, 13, of Toronto, and Vanetia Warner, 10, of Cornwall, Ont., should shake Canadians out of their complacency. But the largely-indifferent-until-now masses should not hurtle to the other extreme, panic. Between complacency and panic is a vast territory – one we should occupy actively, by working, by going to school and, yes, by trick-or-treating.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Well-prepared navy took migrant ship; Armed with guns, armour, hand sanitizer</b>

<p>During a mission to intercept the illegal ship that brought 76 Tamil migrants to the West Coast, a navy crew was armed with guns, protective armour and hand sanitizer to ward off H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>“If the ship had any infectious diseases, my personnel were ready to protect themselves,” Petty Officer 1st Class Tim Edwards told a navy newspaper.</p>
<p>An account published in Lookout, CFB Esquimalt's newspaper, on Monday said the suspicious vessel first appeared on the radar of an Aurora long-range patrol aircraft on Oct. 15, two days before it arrived in Victoria, escorted by the RCMP and military. The air crew knew the ship, which did not have a flag or identification number, was carrying migrants, the newspaper said.</p>
<p>In an interception mission dubbed Operation Poseidon, the vessel was followed covertly for 20 hours by the aircraft and HMCS Regina, a patrol frigate carrying officers from the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency. The illegal boat bore the name Ocean Lady, but has since been identified as the Princess Easwary.</p>
<p>As it neared Port Renfrew, B.C., the ship was swarmed by several RCMP boats and the Regina. Once Mounties secured the vessel, its crew and the migrants, navy personnel assessed the engine room, which the paper noted was “was surprisingly clean” despite having “antiquated technology.” Its controls were labelled in a foreign language.</p>
<p>“Most of us have done this kind of thing before, which gave us automatic confidence. And this was a real time evolution, so the confidence was there and the adrenalin and the excitement because it was a real life insertion,” PO1 Edwards told the newspaper.</p>
<p>The illegal ship was running short on fuel, and with the navy crew at its helm, was brought slowly to Victoria.</p>

</div><div>By Carol Sanders   </div>

</p>
<p>THE H1N1 vaccine isn't for everyone.</p>
<p>Since the mass immunization began in Winnipeg Monday, two people have had rare allergic reactions to it, according to the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>"We have had two incidents involving some allergic-type symptoms," said Dr. Sande Harlos, a WRHA medical officer of health. "This is what we're prepared to deal with."</p>
<p>The maker of the H1N1 vaccine, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, warns that up to one in 1,000 doses may result in an allergic reaction leading to a "dangerous decrease of blood pressure."</p>
<p>"That's why you're asked to wait 15 minutes afterwards," Harlos said. A severe reaction will happen within minutes of getting the shot.</p>
<p>By 3 p.m. Tuesday, 15,695 Winnipeggers had been immunized without incident. When someone reacts badly to the vaccine, there are medical staff on hand to help, Harlos said.</p>
<p>The vaccine recipient is taken to hospital to be kept under observation. Harlos said the two people who reacted badly to the vaccine -- one on Monday and one on Tuesday -- are OK. "They left in good condition."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Winnipegger Janice Dehod is worried about her allergy to the mercury-based preservative thimerosal used in the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I know if it is in eye drops or contact lens preserver, it will make my the skin around my eyes puff up and swell in a really ugly way," she said. "I am not sure what thimerosal will do in my veins."</p>
<p>Harlos said unless someone has a severe egg or thimerosal allergy, they shouldn't have a severe reaction to the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Some people have a mild reaction when it's used topically. That isn't the same as a systemic whole-body reaction," Harlos said.</p>
<p>A severe allergic reaction is an anaphylactic response -- the throat closes, blood pressure plunges and airways tighten, said Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Dehod said she has had an adverse reaction to a flu vaccine in the past, but doesn't know if it contained thimerosal. She wishes Manitoba would obtain vaccine without thimerosal.</p>
<p>"I don't want to be one of those people that falls through the cracks and gets H1N1 because Manitoba Health did a pretty good job for most people and gambled with the health of those that are a little more sensitive to preservative."</p>
<p>carol.sanders@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Mercury downplayed</p>
<p>Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative. In large concentrations, or over extended periods of exposure, mercury can cause damage to the brain and kidneys. However, the Public Health Agency of Canada says the amount of mercury in the H1N1 flu vaccine is significantly less than in a can of tuna.</p>
<p>The National Advisory Committee on Immunization has recommended a long-term goal of removing thimerosal from vaccines, provided that safe alternatives to this preservative can be found. "This will help to reduce unnecessary environmental exposure to mercury."</p>

<p>Victoria -- The coverage of swine flu in your newspaper (Historic Vaccine Rollout Begins As Flu Ramps Up – front page, Oct. 27) reminds me of the old story of the man beating a drum in his backyard and telling his neighbour it was to keep the lions away. “But there are no lions here,” said the neighbour. “Yes,” came the reply, “it's very effective, isn't it?”</p>

<p>Should you be immunized against the H1N1 influenza? That depends on who you are, where you live and when you ask. Notwithstanding the increasingly hard sell from some public-health authorities, the truth is that the vaccine will be too late to be of real value for many Canadians.</p>
<p>H1N1 is already active in many parts of Canada. It's an early flu season, but a relatively mild one. “Mild” still means that more than a million Canadians will get a little sick and a small number will get very ill. But this is no more than we expect every year from influenza.</p>
<p>We had the measure of H1N1 even before we had a vaccine. Our health-care system will not be overwhelmed. Commerce will not grind to a halt. Women are no more vulnerable than men. Mortality rates are highest in people of middle age or older.</p>
<p>Two-thirds of severe illness and death will be in people with serious underlying medical problems.</p>
<p>Healthy people have little to fear from H1N1. The virus itself has not changed. About one in 20 will develop an unpleasant but short-lived “flu.” Their chances of dying from H1N1 are about 1 in 250,000. The same healthy person is about 20 times more likely to die this year from a motor-vehicle crash.</p>
<p>Over the next few weeks, we will see a few more deaths in otherwise healthy young people – because more people are getting infected than in a usual flu season. Unfortunately, these individual tragedies will be blown out of proportion by the media.</p>
<p>In addition to people with underlying medical problems, H1N1 tends to be more severe in pregnant women and in children under the age of 5. Babies under six months of age are also vulnerable but cannot be immunized. (People living with a young baby should be immunized to avoid bringing the virus home.)</p>
<p>The Canadian government is boasting that there is enough vaccine for everyone. This is a tad disingenuous. The vaccine is arriving in weekly aliquots of two million to three million doses. We don't actually have enough vaccine to immunize everyone right now. And, as it turns out, timing is a crucial issue for many Canadians.</p>
<p>Local flu outbreaks typically peak within four or five weeks and then drop off rapidly. The vaccine takes time – probably a week – to provide protection after it is given. When H1N1 is gone, it's almost certainly gone for this flu season.</p>
<p>The worst of H1N1 will have passed from some areas of Canada – Southern Ontario and the lower mainland of British Columbia, at least – before healthy people can even roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>The new adjuvanted influenza vaccine is safe and effective. The risk of a significant reaction is extremely small. But we don't immunize people just because we can. We're supposed to base our recommendations on expectations of benefit.</p>
<p>Quite appropriately, public-health authorities are giving priority to immunizing the most vulnerable. They should get immunized as quickly as possible. Two-thirds of all immunization benefits will come from protecting these small groups. Everyone else should wait. It's far too late to apprehend the outbreak anyway.</p>
<p>So what about the healthy general public?</p>
<p>If the vaccine becomes available to you before H1N1 hits your part of the country, then it's entirely reasonable to be immunized. It's also reasonable to take a pass. The anticipated benefits from immunization are very small, and the risks are tiny. But if H1N1 has already peaked in your community, these benefits drop off dramatically. It's too late.</p>
<p>But there is a place where our surplus Canadian vaccine – all 30 million doses or so – can do some real good. Send it to developing countries that will soon face a second wave of H1N1 without a vaccine, antiviral drugs or intensive-care units to assist their most vulnerable.</p>
<p>There's still time to do that.</p>

<p>‘Help! Help! The new CBC News format overboggles the mind”</p>
<p>Regarding CBC Newsworld – now “CBC News Network” – and the radical rejigging of The National, I make an appeal. Please send me your thoughts and observations. It's too much for one man to deal with, there is only so much boggling a mind can take.</p>
<p>Herewith, my observations. And stick with me because there's a climax at the end: Pastor Mansbridge on his feet, looking like a man behind the counter of a bar wondering who stole the beer taps.</p>
<p>Mid-morning on Monday, eyes adjusted to the swirling orange colour and pop-up giant computer screens, and ears adjusted to the rinky-dink disco music, I noted a bit on the News Network (there are tons of “bits,” perhaps on the assumption that all of us are four years old and have the attention span of a fruit fly) about why “folks” are reluctant to get the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>I was looking at the list when it disappeared and along came Jelena Adzic to deliver the entertainment news. I knew this because on a big screen behind Adzic, it said “Entertainment.” In orange, of course. Not that the orange matched or complemented the colourful dress Adzic was wearing, which was distracting.</p>
<p>Next came Suhana Meharchand who performed the remarkable trick of standing up. Standing up is a big thing with CBC News Network and The National. As if, you know, the great Canadian public had long laboured under the false impression that everybody at CBC only sat down for a living. Anyway, Wendy Mesley was also standing nearby and Meharchand announced, “Wendy Mesley is totally lovable and great!” Mesley looked pleased. Anybody would. I was surprised the pair didn't go for lattes to discuss how great and lovable Mesley is. But that might have involved sitting down, which is verboten.</p>
<p>Instead Mesley and Meharchand talked about CBC News Network's new look and attitude. Helpfully, the text on the screen said, “New look. New attitude.” Mind you, I couldn't help but notice that the channel remains infested with those Grey Power car-insurance commercials featuring that screaming crazy-lady. New look, my posterior.</p>
<p>Then came Carole MacNeil who was – God bless my soul! – sitting down. She must have got special dispensation. Frankly, it was a disappointing departure from the new orthodoxy. I know for a fact she can stand up and do stuff while vertical. Anyway, the big story in the afternoon was the “flash” protest in the House of Commons. “Blood was on the stairs,” declared Rosemary Barton, whom I think was sitting down. The story was presented in a deeply confusing manner and Barton had the air of someone who thought the protest was an outrageous intrusion into the congenial, predictable workday on the Hill. You can jazz it up, but you can't erase the self-importance of CBC's Ottawa bureau.</p>
<p>Things went awry, briefly. “I'm having trouble hearing you, Rosemary,” MacNeil said. So Rosemary said something again, louder. Then MacNeil said, “I think somebody's got something going on upstairs!” And waved her hand in winding motion, like you indicate that somebody's a bit loopy. All too true, Miss.</p>
<p>Next, The Lang & O'Leary Exchange, to cover the business news of the day. It was conducted as a “He said/she said” exchange between Kevin O'Leary and Amanda Lang and it was contrived, trivial nonsense. After the banter, the other business news was introduced as – and I kid you not – “The Other Stuff.” Soon, however, O'Leary came over all hostile and sneering with Finance Minister Jim Flaherty. Flaherty looked furious. It was priceless. Can O'Leary do that every day, please? Highlight of the day.</p>
<p>Evan Solomon arrived to do Power & Politics. As the whole country knows, Solomon is no Don Newman. But he sure can stand up. Mind you, he's no Wolf Blitzer either. Some protesters in Ottawa were interviewed. This was good – one had an obviously injured face – but Solomon stuck to the matter of the global warming policy they protested. I was thinking, “Hey, Solomon, look – there's a guy with a seriously injured face, right there.” Then Rosemary Barton intervened and got snooty all over again with the protesters.</p>
<p>Time passed. Eventually came the big moment – the new-look National. Pastor Mansbridge on his feet, helluva thing. The top story was, again, the H1N1 flu shot story. Next, some survey about how Canadians feel about the Royal Family. Hellooo? Some drivel about the royals is the second-most important news story in Canada? At that point I imagined both Lloyd Robertson and Kevin Newman laughing their heads off. The Royal freakin' Family?</p>
<p>Time passed again, but more slowly. There was a shot of a mysterious blond lady standing face to face with the Pastor. Her presence went unexplained for a while. Turned out it was reporter Kelly Crowe. The Pastor and Crowe conducted a discussion, standing up, face-to-face. Like two people about to play hacky sack. Crowe had the footwear for it. The Pastor didn't. Claire Martin did the weather. With many hand gestures, she talked about hurricanes in the Philippines and without missing a beat said, “That's your forecast, Peter.” I'm serious. She did. Storm in the Philippines was the forecast.</p>
<p>Then the Pastor went behind the counter of the bar that is now the National set. He played bartender. Among those playing customers were Amanda Lang and former chief of the defence staff, retired general Rick Hillier. Nobody got a drink. The beer taps and liquor bottles were missing. Hillier looked like he could use a beverage. Me too. Watching all that standing up made me tired.</p>
<p>Am I wrong here? Is there not something farcical and fatuous about the standing up, the orange screens and the belief that this is, somehow, a better way to deliver the news? I'm asking you.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Airing tonight</p>
<p>The Botany of Desire (PBS, 9 p.m.) is a lavish, lovely, two-hour doc based on Michael Pollan's best-selling book of the same title. Narrated by Frances McDormand, it explores the social history of four plants, the apple, the tulip, cannabis and the potato. It's about ideas of beauty, desire and, well, food. It also about what motivates us in dealing with nature – sweetness, beauty, intoxication and power.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>High fever, cough among symptoms</b>
</div><div>Megan O'Toole    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>626 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Q How many people have died from H1N1 in Canada?</p>
<p>A The latest numbers from the Public Health Agency of Canada show a total of 96 deaths countrywide from H1N1. The majority of those cases were in Ontario and Quebec, with the East Coast and northern Canada largely spared.</p>
<p>Q Should we be concerned about this?</p>
<p>A These numbers are not cause for panic, health officials say. Death from H1N1 is "a rare event, and is a particularly rare event in young people," noted Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health. In that province, the average age of those who have died from H1N1 is 55, and nearly 90% of those who have succumbed to the virus had a pre-existing health condition.</p>
<p>Q How quickly does the virus progress in the body?</p>
<p>A That depends. It can progress more quickly in those with chronic conditions, such as a respiratory illness, by leading to complications. In general, officials say, it takes two to seven days after exposure for symptoms of H1N1 to develop.</p>
<p>Q In light of this week's death of a healthy young teenager, should all children be vaccinated early?</p>
<p>A The H1N1 flu virus affects younger people more, officials say, but most experience few complications from the disease. A number of ''priority groups'' has been identified nationally who should get the vaccine first, but preteen and teenaged children are not among them.</p>
<p>Q So who are the priority groups?</p>
<p>A They include pregnant and breastfeeding women, health-care workers, young children between six months and five years of age, people with chronic medical conditions, care providers and those living in remote or isolated communities.</p>
<p>Q What are the symptoms of H1N1?</p>
<p>A If a child develops a high fever and cough, parents should watch closely for additional symptoms, such as breathing difficulties, discoloration of the lips, extreme drowsiness, crankiness or fussiness in infants, or not drinking enough fluids, Dr. King said. If there is cause for concern, citizens are advised to contact a health-care provider.</p>
<p>Q How do you know if you've contracted a mild or severe case of the flu?</p>
<p>A Both mild and severe cases come from the same strain of the flu, and because H1N1 is a "novel" virus, it is more likely to cause severe illness in people who are otherwise young and healthy, said Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's medical officer of health. It is not clear why some of those people die and others do not.</p>
<p>Q Should I pull my child out of school or extracurricular events?</p>
<p>A School closures have not been shown to be effective, Dr. King said, because young people tend to congregate in groups outside of school regardless. In addition, school can be a good place to teach children about how to prevent infection. "I think it's important that we keep living our lives," she said. Children involved in outside activities such as sports teams should take care to keep their hands clean and not share water bottles, Dr. McKeown said.</p>
<p>Q What should we do to prevent the spread of H1N1?</p>
<p>A Getting the vaccination is the No. 1 way to prevent its spread, officials say. But other helpful tips include washing hands often, keeping common surfaces clean, coughing or sneezing into your sleeve if a tissue is unavailable, and staying home from work if symptoms show up.</p>
<p>Q Is there enough vaccine to go around?</p>
<p>A Yes. "We are very fortunate in this country to have enough vaccine for anyone who will need and want it, and we are rolling out that vaccine as quickly as possible," Dr. King said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'This took my son'; 13-year-old boy developed cough on Saturday</b>
</div><div>Mary Vallis    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>622 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio was a healthy 13-year-old who loved playing minor hockey. But after developing a cough and sore throat on Saturday, he collapsed in his family's Toronto bathroom and died on Monday morning while his father tried to revive him.</p>
<p>"This took my son," Paul Frustaglio, Evan's father, said in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>"We're victims, now, of this dreaded disease."</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health yesterday confirmed that Evan died of the H1N1 virus, and the highly publicized case about such an atypical swine flu victim galvanized parents once skeptical of the H1N1 vaccine to consider getting their children the shot and even prompted the city to launch its public vaccination clinics early.</p>
<p>A national vaccination campaign began Monday, the same day Evan died.</p>
<p>The virus has now contributed to more than 90 deaths in Canada. Three new deaths in British Columbia and another three in Alberta were also announced yesterday.</p>
<p>"The sad news of this boy's death is a reminder that while most flu illness is mild, severe illness and death are a part of the picture of this pandemic," said Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health. Dr. McKeown said Evan had suffered from mild asthma. But Mr. Frustaglio said that was not the case.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, characterized Evan's death as "a very, very rare occurrence."</p>
<p>Two other boys who play for the Mississauga North Stars, the same minor bantam AA hockey team as Evan, have reported flu-like symptoms, said John Gardner, president of the Greater Toronto Hockey League. "This is something you just can't predict," Mr. Gardner said. "All you can do is encourage concentration on doing the right thing, in terms of keeping clean."</p>
<p>Before Evan's death, the league advised players not to share water bottles and clean their equipment thoroughly because of the virus. The league has cancelled the team's next two games in tribute to Evan.</p>
<p>In an emotional interview, Mr. Frustaglio described how his son, an otherwise healthy boy who attended a school for student athletes, developed a sore throat and fever during a hockey tournament in London, Ont., on Saturday.</p>
<p>Evan and his mother, Ann-Marie, a registered nurse, drove back to their Toronto home early Sunday morning. That afternoon, Evan's parents took him to a walk-in clinic. A doctor said the boy's lungs were clear; they returned home without a prescription, with instructions to give him Gravol to control nausea.</p>
<p>After seeing the doctor, Evan vomited several times. By the next morning, however, he appeared to be on the mend. Mr. Frustaglio stayed home from work and kept Evan home from school. Evan asked to take a bath. He collapsed on the bathroom floor afterwards; Mr. Frustaglio called 911 and began CPR. But Evan was later pronounced dead at St. Joseph's Health Centre. The coroner's office told Mr. Frustaglio that an autopsy will not be conducted on his son's body.</p>
<p>Evan's school, Hill Academy, in Vaughan, cancelled classes yesterday. Evan's classmates have posted tributes on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> praising the Grade 8 student's friendly nature and athleticism.</p>
<p>Evan's parents planned to vaccinate their boys against H1N1, are urging everyone to get the controversial vaccine.</p>
<p>"To be honest with you, everybody should know about what's going on. We don't really know what's going on," Mr. Frustaglio said of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"All I know is that my son died real quick and he shouldn't have.... We just don't know what's going on."</p>

<p>British Columbians looking for information on H1N1 swine flu are jamming telephone services and smashing website records.</p>
<p>It began Monday and continued yesterday, the first two days of what is being billed as the largest vaccination effort ever undertaken in B.C. Public-health officials are aiming for an H1N1 vaccination rate of 70 per cent of the population, a number they say will stop the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>The provincial health line, 8-1-1, where callers can ask questions of a registered nurse or other health-care provider, is being inundated with calls, most about H1N1.</p>
<p>Extra lines should be in service today, with up to 40 health-care providers ready to answer questions, said Health minister Kevin Falcon.</p>
<p>"We do recognize and have said from the beginning that our system is going to be taxed as we go through the onset and expansion of the pandemic," said Falcon. "We are asking British Columbians to have some patience as we go through what is the largest vaccination program in provincial history."</p>
<p>Falcon asked 8-1-1 callers who encounter a busy signal to wait five minutes and call back, or go to the website www.healthlinkbc.ca[http://www.healthlinkbc.ca], where a series of questions and answers can help patients better understand their condition.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority's website recorded 13,500 hits on Monday, up from 2,000 on the Monday a week earlier.</p>
<p>Inoculations continued yesterday, at the Victoria Public Health Unit on Cook Street, and on Pender Island.</p>
<p>This week, people with underlying health conditions such as asthma or diabetes, pregnant women and people in remote communities are being targeted. Next week, it's children aged six months to five years, health-care workers, people in household contact with infants under six months and people with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>Sandra Herbison, manager of public health units, estimated that 500 people received shots in Victoria yesterday, a jump from the opening day's 360.</p>
<p>To improve crowd control, numbers were handed out to people in line and an express lane was set up for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>"It went much smoother and we got a lot of people through," said Herbison.</p>
<p>Even though waits were as long as two hours for some people, most were understanding, she said.</p>
<p>Vaccinations continue today at the centre court of Hillside Centre at 1644 Hillside Ave., Gordon Head Recreation Centre at 4100 Lambrick Way, and Saturna Island. Check the health authority's website at www.viha.ca/h1n1[http://www.viha.ca/h1n1] for times and locations.</p>
<p>Clinics will also proceed in Campbell River, Cumberland, Duncan, Lake Cowichan and Nanaimo.</p>
<p>A bigger test awaits health workers tomorrow, when the first mass vaccination clinic happens at Westshore Town Centre, 2945 Jacklin Rd, from 1 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. It's hoped as many as 2,500 people will be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Falcon said there are bound to be hiccups in such a massive undertaking. "But I have great confidence in our public-health officials and our system to be able to manage our way through it."</p>

<p>When pigs fly ... well, the swine flu: There is a lot to consider when deciding how to protect your family from the pandemic of swine flu. And yes, I know the name has been formally changed to H1N1, but that sounds more like a short, round robot from Star Wars than a worldwide contagion. Although I am not big on vaccinations and have never gotten the shot for seasonal flu, I am thinking that I may get the vaccine to help protect my family.</p>
<p>With the travel that we do for football, as well as the physical nature of the game, I would hate to catch the virus and spread it to our teenaged daughter, nine-month-old son or my pregnant wife. Also, we have to consider the possible risks of vaccination while sifting through mountains of information out there. Some of it is downright frightening.</p>
<p>Mohawk Vaccine? The Rider Mohawk has been spreading around our locker room. In a mid-October Leader-Post article, Andy Fantuz explained: "Some guys grow playoff beards, we're growing Mohawks. It's good to see a bunch of guys buying into it. They don't care what other people think and it shows that we're in this together.'' At the time, only a few guys had braved the clippers and they were recruiting others to join them.</p>
<p>Chris Getzlaf claimed that he had to maintain a level of professionalism for his job at Investors Group. A couple of days later -- Hawked up. I stated that the idea was great to have the starting five receivers and quarterback show unity with their Mohawks (conveniently, I was not included in that group). Last week, that statement bit me back when I was inserted into the starting lineup. By game time, both Johnny Quinn and I were Hawked up. In that same Leader-Post article, our leader proved to be a bit of a soothsayer ...</p>
<p>"We're trying to build something here,'' said Durant, whose head is normally clean-shaven. "I know that we're going to have more guys jump on the wagon this week. Hopefully we'll have a team full of Mohawks going into the playoffs.'' It's getting awful close to the playoffs, Stevie Baggs and Joel Bell ...</p>
<p>Our last Wild Game was not on TSN: The annual Wild Game Dinner took place on Monday night for Riders players, staff and alumni. It is an event that combines food, fellowship, a few cold ones and some stiff competition. The annual crib tournament seems to feature Jeremy O'Day in the final year after year (Team Szarka took the title), and an 11-player poker tournament lasted for hours with Andy Fantuz claiming bragging rights. The main event of the night was the dishes of wild game served for dinner. Pheasant, elk, duck, venison, bison and many other wild game were served and enjoyed by all of us at the Seven Oaks.</p>

<p>The Regina Pats are trying to be proactive in the fight against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The WHL club's players and staff received their regularly scheduled flu inoculations on Tuesday and are slated to receive a second shot next month when the H1N1 vaccinations are made available to the general public. In the meantime, the Pats are taking extra precautions to protect their players, who fall within an age group (16-20) that's considered most susceptible.</p>
<p>According to GM Brent Parker, none of his players have contracted the virus to this point, but the team is well aware of the risks. The Pats spend a great deal of time in confined spaces like dressing rooms and buses. The team also billets its players with families that include young children. In addition, the players have regular contact with the public, be it through attending high school, making autograph appearances or visiting schools through literacy and drug-education initiatives.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure we monitor it properly and do the things we need to do to make sure the kids are looked after," offered Parker. "I don't think you want to cause undue panic but you have to be smart enough to do the little things that are required to keep yourself healthy."</p>
<p>Regina health-care workers have been offered the first round of the H1N1 vaccine this week. It's slated to be delivered to other high-risk groups beginning on Monday, followed by the general public in the middle of the month. This comes in the wake of news that a 13-year-old hockey player from Toronto died of H1N1 earlier this week.</p>
<p>"That's an awful thing for that family to be dealing with," said Parker. "You have to be mindful of (the risks). You'd be foolish not to. That's why we're taking the steps that we are. We're always trying to do everything we can to keep the kids healthy and safe. Having said that, because our guys are in a high-risk situation, there are certainly no guarantees that one of them won't contract it regardless of whether they get a shot. You just try to lessen the risk of that happening."</p>
<p>With that in mind, Pats athletic therapist Greg Mayer has talked to the players about ways of reducing the danger. That includes washing their hands frequently, coughing into their arms instead of their hands, getting proper rest and staying hydrated. In addition to making hand sanitizer readily available, the Pats provide multi-vitamins and dietary supplements to aid their health and immune systems. The team also washes its equipment in hot water and sterilizes water bottles.</p>
<p>"People die of a normal flu all the time but usually it's a complication because maybe they had cancer, maybe they had some kind auto-immune deficiency or something that is usually a precursor," explained Mayer. "Most healthy people don't die of the flu but one is too many. We'd rather make sure our guys are protected."</p>
<p>The Pats' team doctor Ian Hill placed an order for the H1N1 shots about four months ago in hopes that the vaccine would be ready by the fall. However, due to high demand, that order didn't go through and the Pats will have to wait until it's released to the general public.</p>

<p>The province's first flu assessment site opened in Estevan Tuesday because the local hospital's emergency room was swamped.</p>
<p>"St. Joseph's Hospital in Estevan has seen higher-than-usual activity in the emergency department last week and through the weekend," Dr. Shauna Hudson, the Sun Country Health Region's medical health officer, said in a news release Tuesday. "There was a smaller increase in emergency room visits for influenza-like illness at the Weyburn General Hospital over the weekend."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 50 cases of H1N1 influenza were confirmed in 12 towns and two cities in the region. Ten schools reported at least 10 per cent of students absent because of illness. Not all of the sickness is influenza-like illness.</p>
<p>Of the lab-confirmed cases, 54 per cent were females and the average age was 18 years. Twenty-nine people under age 15 tested positive for H1N1.</p>
<p>Also among the confirmed cases were two children under the age of one, one case in the one- to- four-year category, 10 children between five and nine years and 16 between 10 and 14 years.</p>
<p>People with mild influenza-like symptoms also will be redirected to the assessment centre. The region stresses that emergency rooms exist to treat life-threatening illness such as difficulty breathing, uncontrolled bleeding, chest pain, numbness or paralysis.</p>
<p>"We knew that, at some point in a pandemic, we would need to ask people to change how they access care in our hospitals to have their conditions assessed," Hudson said. "We are prepared for this possibility."</p>
<p>Elective procedures and surgeries at St. Joseph's are postponed until further notice.</p>
<p>Regina's schools have not yet been impacted by H1N1. According to spokespeople for the Regina Catholic and public systems on Tuesday, no schools have reported an absenteeism rate over 10 per cent.</p>
<p>The number of lab-confirmed H1N1 cases in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region was under 20 last week, but it is not releasing further numbers, stating: "(It) is following the lead of the federal and provincial governments in not reporting confirmed cases of H1N1 as they do not fully reflect the situation in the community. We know that H1N1 is present in Saskatchewan and RQHR and we encourage people to continue to follow good hand hygiene and get their pandemic H1N1 vaccinations when clinics begin."</p>
<p>Regina's hospitals aren't moving emergency rooms off-site to protect noninfected patients from those with H1N1, but Michael Redenbach, vice-president of primary health care for the region, said planning has been done for a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>"We do have provisions in place to operate a field hospital -- how we would staff it and how we would do the supplies and all of the other components of operating an off-site facility, but we have no evidence at this point that is upcoming."</p>
<p>Health regions will look at contingency plans if there's a major flu surge, said Health Minister Don McMorris following Question Period.</p>
<p>"In the event that there is a huge increase in H1N1, there is going to be certainly some pressures. There isn't a system across Canada that, if you have a huge influx, there isn't going to be pressure on their system and some contingency plans will be put in place," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Union warns of respiratory therapist shortage</b>
</div><div>Anne Kyle   </div>
<div>Leader-Post</div>
<div>439 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>The union representing respiratory therapists (RTs) is warning that, in a worst-case scenario, there may not be enough staff to care for ventilated H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>"Respiratory therapists continue to be a hard-to-recruit position,'' Health Sciences Association of Saskatchewan (HSAS) president Chris Driol said, calling on the government to hire more health-care professionals.</p>
<p>Health Minister Don McMorris said Tuesday that more recruiting needs to be done, but that the province has made strides hiring 30 additional RTs since 2007.</p>
<p>"It is important to remember it takes 41/2 full-time equivalents to keep a staff person on site 24/7. It is not like these ventilated patients will be ill from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday to Friday,'' Driol said.</p>
<p>Acceptable standards of care for acutely ill ventilated patients call for a ratio of one RT for every four to six ventilators, the union said.</p>
<p>In a serious H1N1 outbreak, based on other health-care jurisdictions experiences, the workload could double and RTs could be forced to work 16- to 20-hour days, every day for the next six to eight weeks, he said.</p>
<p>"Our gravest concern is whether our respiratory therapists will have sufficient numbers to keep up with the workload. And that raises some grave concerns about their ability to work effectively and provide the best possible care'' Driol said.</p>
<p>Stephen Chard, the registrar with the Saskatchewan College of Respiratory Therapists, noted Saskatchewan has 158 licensed RTs compared to Nova Scotia, which has 260 RTs, but also relies on doctors and some critical-care paramedics under the guidance of physicians to manage ventilated patients.</p>
<p>"I would wager that most health regions would plan to use respiratory therapists and other health-care professionals to the full scope of practise in order to maximize their impact in a worse-case-scenario,'' Chard said.</p>
<p>McMorris reiterated that health regions will be looking at contingency plans if there's a major flu surge to ensure enough staff is in place, possibly by moving workers around.</p>
<p>"In the event that there is a huge increase in H1N1, there is going to be, certainly, some pressures. There isn't a system across Canada that, if you have a huge influx, there isn't going to be pressure on their system and, some contingency plans will be put in place," McMorris said.</p>
<p>As part of their pandemic planning, the Saskatoon and the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Regions are training critical care nurses to provide assistance to RTs in monitoring acutely ill patients.</p>

<p>Hannah Dicks was always a fighter.</p>
<p>She rallied her way through battle after battle with medical problems over the 61/2 years of her too-short life, starting with a viral infection that put her in a coma at the age of five weeks.</p>
<p>Always tube-fed and never able to speak or walk, she was no stranger to intensive care units. But when she was admitted to a Saskatoon hospital in July for treatment of a bone condition, no one imagined her last fight would be a losing one -- with the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"It came as a complete shock to us," said her father, Paul Dicks, in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p>"She was a strong little girl and a real fighter, and she was sick an awful lot -- so what they say about H1N1 is very true, that it certainly has an effect on the sick ... an awful lot faster than it does on you and me."</p>
<p>Hannah contracted the virus while in hospital, and it killed her in less than week. Hers was the third death attributed to H1N1 in Saskatchewan this year.</p>
<p>According to provincial health officials, there have been five so far.</p>
<p>They don't know exactly how she caught it, but Dicks is not interested in pointing fingers.</p>
<p>"A lot of people (ask if) I blame the hospital. No I don't, because this is part of what happens in life, you know? There's not much else you can do," he said.</p>
<p>Hannah was dearly loved, and until very recently, Dicks was too devastated to feel comfortable talking about his family's loss. But he wanted to do something.</p>
<p>As general manager of a busy hotel in La Ronge, he started thinking about ways the business could set an example with its prevention efforts during the pandemic, besides the usual hand-sanitizing stations.</p>
<p>"Our staff came up with -- oh, goodness gracious, 30 ideas that were put in place," he said.</p>
<p>For example, the hotel's busy restaurant now completely clears its tables between servings, so cutlery and condiment dispensers aren't sitting around waiting for someone to sneeze on them. Servers, kitchen workers and housekeeping staff wear disposable gloves. Shower curtains are laundered daily, and door handles are sprayed with a disinfectant every hour.</p>
<p>"I don't know if we're going to make a difference, but if we all try and if we all went a little bit farther, I think we can all make a difference," he said.</p>
<p>Health authorities rightly feel obligated to strongly advise people about handwashing and other basic measures during the pandemic, but it's not up to them to pass restrictive laws or dictate how businesses are run, Dicks added.</p>
<p>"But it not only affects our customers, it affects our staff. If the H1N1 virus goes through this building, I've seen how sick somebody can get. I could lose half my staff overnight, you know, being out sick. Subsequently, it shuts down my business, and we need to protect our customers and protect our staff to make sure that we can operate."</p>
<p>He admits it sometimes bothers him when people who aren't aware of his loss show complacency about the threat of the pandemic.</p>
<p>"But I can change what I can change," he said. "I'm challenging every restaurant and hotel in our province to step up to the plate and do a little bit more. If we all work together, what's considered a big threat right now could become a small threat, if we all understand what we have to do."</p>
<p>Dicks and his family are living, grieving reminders that not everyone is lucky enough to be in a low-risk category and have no loved ones vulnerable to this flu.</p>
<p>"If I can help keep people well, that's what it's about for me right now, anyway," he said.</p>

<p>In any service industry, people are bound to complain. But in family medical practices, it seems as though the number of complaints has beenincreasing. Many of these are not related to the provision of care, but rather reflect "administrative issues." Speaking to my colleagues, the problem is endemic.</p>
<p>There are four primary areas of patient dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>The first relates to in-office waiting. Understandably, patients want to be seen at their appointment time. They cannot understand why I fall behind schedule. After all, they have other commitments. Frankly, being tardy is unfair to the patient, stresses me out and stretches my day by a number of hours. Occasionally, the problem is overbooking. I may have delivered a baby on a previous day and am trying to accommodate patients whose appointments were cancelled.</p>
<p>Patients are also frequently not forthcoming about the true intent of their visit, telling my secretary that it will only be a few minutes. Few things take only "a few minutes," and invariably the problem is much more complex (and urgent) than implied. Other times, patients arrive with an entourage, asking me to check others who were not booked. It is tough to say no to a worried mother. Regardless of time constraints, I will not cut corners.</p>
<p>Another major cause of time delays is added questions. Lately, every patient has asked me about the H1N1 vaccination. If I spend just three minutes with 20 patients addressing this question -- that's an hour of unexpected delay.</p>
<p>The second complaint concerns the difficulty of arranging an appointment. There are many reasons for this, not the least of which are demands brought on by the exponential increase in paperwork and telephone communications. I have stopped booking patients on Fridays to try to keep up with this work and fewer hours are available for direct care.</p>
<p>The third complaint is the amount of time it takes to get a referral. Inconsistencies between consultants' demands, an increase in the number of consultants who are limiting the range of their practice, and a general dearth of services have all contributed to this problem.</p>
<p>The fourth complaint relates to the difficulty getting through on the phone. Our secretaries are inundated with calls from patients who want telephone answers, referrals, results, etc. Staff are constantly on the phone trying to arrange referrals, scheduling investigations and dealing with a myriad of patient concerns.</p>
<p>This list is not exhaustive. Perhaps knowing what transpires behind the scenes will give you insight into why those things that trouble you are happening. I know we are all trying our best.</p>

<p>It's hockey season. Time for concussions, contusions and sprains. This year, it also means influenza and its infamous variant, H1N1. This week's tragic story of Etobicoke, Ont., teen Evan Frustaglio, who died of the illness only days after a hockey tournament, has thrust the issue into the limelight. To echo the advice of health officials and Hockey Canada, there is no need for parents to panic. This infection usually makes you feel miserable for a few days, and then it fades away. That being said, thousands of coughing, sneezing youths will be crowded into dressing rooms and team buses this winter. Serious illness aside, if team officials don't follow a strategy to beat the flu, some team rosters could be seriously depleted before they even hit the ice.</p>
<p>Hockey has always shared the seasonal calendar with the usual illness caused by influenza A. But H1N1 adds a new twist to the perennial challenge. In itself, H1N1 is no more dangerous than ordinary seasonal flu. The symptoms of H1N1 (fever, headache, chills, nausea, sore muscles, runny nose) are the same and no more severe than seasonal flu. What makes the newcomer scary is the speed with which it spreads. More people are dying or becoming seriously ill from H1N1 because, overall, more people are contracting the illness. Youngsters, most of whom are otherwise healthy, are targets because their immune systems simply haven't "seen" this viral variant. Bear in mind, it's been 41 years since the last global flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The fact that H1N1 only carries a 1% risk of causing serious illness or death means that some coaches, athletes and trainers may take it lightly. But as several NFL teams learned last week, H1N1 can keep key players in bed, where the only effect they will have on the game is through the TV remote. Last week, the Cleveland Browns had 12 players home sick with flu-like symptoms and the team scaled back practice sessions. And even in youth hockey, since no player likes seeing his team lose, some of these no-shows may come back too soon, thinking they're</p>
<p>doing their comrades a favour. They're not.</p>
<p>Dr. Dhiren Naidu, head team physician for the NHL's Edmonton Oilers, has taken a firm stand against the flu this year. It's a layered approach that combines prevention, treatment and confining the spread of the disease. "The team policy begins with hand-washing," Naidu says, "wiping down exercise equipment and making hand sanitizer [an alcohol-based gel] available throughout the dressing room." Naidu and his associates keep a keen watch for symptoms. "Any player that has a fever, abrupt onset of cough, myalgias [muscle aches], fatigue, sore throat or runny nose is not to come to the dressing room or rink. They need to phone the head trainer and see a team physician for assessment."</p>
<p>The Oilers offer every player vaccination for both seasonal flu and H1N1, and Naidu urges players to get both shots. Infected Oilers are treated with anti-viral medication if they have a chronic disease or are severely ill. But keeping in mind that adults are usually contagious for about a week, players aren't allowed to return to the ice prematurely, no matter how good they feel. "We're very careful in this regard," Naidu says.</p>
<p>The Oilers' strategy is worth emulating at any level of the game. Your child should be washing his or her hands and not sharing water bottles as a matter of course. Parents and coaches should be aware that children remain contagious longer than adults -- as long as 10 days -- and make that a consideration when allowing even a non-symptomatic child back into play. Now is not the time to worry about appearing like the only nagging parent on the team. Give your children a tiny bottle of hand sanitizer and persistently remind them to use it. It's as wholesome as chicken soup.</p>
<p>The greatest challenge is breaking the chain of contagion. For the sake of everyone, teach your kids to sneeze into their sleeve or the crook of their elbow. All it takes is for an infected player to cough or sneeze into his hand and to apply that hand to a doorknob. The next player who uses that doorknob may then raise his hand to his face and away we go. Coaches and players still need to perfect their shooting, blocking and puck control. But when hockey season clashes with flu season, teams need to add infection control if they want to win.</p>

<p>Recent news reports have suggested confusion among Canadians as to whether or not to get the H1N1 flu shot for themselves or their children. Perhaps this has something to do with the media's rush to bombard us about the H1N1 "pandemic" close to two months ago -- even though the meaning of "pandemic" is seemingly not understood by anyone.</p>
<p>What happened after "pandemic" was splashed all across the news? Not only did the vast majority of us did not get sick, we also did not personally know anyone who did contract H1N1! Typical media hype, we thought.</p>
<p>Now that the flu shot is being made available some people are not sure if they will get it even though medical professionals recommend it. And why? Because the very same media that once talked of pandemics now gives equal air time to vaccinationskeptics as they do the medical profssionals!</p>
<p>Newspapers and television networks will claim that this is "balance," but it is worth noting that on many other issues, the media will build up a story without any attempt to feign balance. Global warming, anyone? Or should I say climate change?</p>
<p>This attitude may boost ratings and circulation but is counter-productive. It is getting to the point, having been exposed to so much sensationalism and biased reporting, no one believes "the news," even when it is providing information that might save lives.</p>
<p>Thank God for newspapers like the Post!</p>

</p>
<p>Families anxious to get their children the H1N1 flu shot arrived in droves to the region's first clinic Tuesday, forming a line that -- at its longest -- wound through the parking lot and along the sidewalk and required more than a two-hour wait.</p>
<p>The clinic opened at 2 p.m. with people already waiting. It was supposed to last until 8 p.m., but at around 6:30 p.m. no more people were allowed to line up, with the expectation that it would take until 9 p.m. to serve those already in line.</p>
<p>OPP officers directed traffic outside the Tecumseh Knights of Columbus hall on Lesperance Road and one officer was stationed at the back of the line to tell people they were out of luck.</p>
<p>"My husband was going 'you better go, you better go,' but when I got here the police officer said we'd have to come back at another time," said Sandi Singh, who brought her four-year-old son at around 7 p.m. "I guess we'll have to come back another time. It's a little ridiculous, but what can you do?"</p>
<p>A man named Joe was more exasperated.</p>
<p>He'd come with his two kids and was frustrated to be turned away. "I'm a teacher, I'm getting thrown in the fire every day," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Jody Hurst, a family physician who'd arrived with her children to get the shot and was turned away, said the vaccination program should have been better planned. "All this hype across the country," she said. "Here it is and nobody's prepared."</p>
<p>Health unit staff didn't have a count Tuesday night of how many people got the shot, but the number is more than 1,000. They brought 2,000 doses to the clinic.</p>
<p>Less than an hour after the clinic opened at 2 p.m., at least 100 people were lined up. Inside the hall, more were waiting to get vaccinated -- everyone from crying babies and toddlers to seniors in wheelchairs.</p>
<p>Agata Inch said she researched the pros and cons of the H1N1 vaccine before bringing her sons, six-year-old Max and five-year-old Mikhail, to the clinic.</p>
<p>"We have doctors in our family and they have strongly recommended it," said Inch, who also got the flu shot.</p>
<p>"I think the risks of not getting the shot are greater. We want to be protected."</p>
<p>Children between the ages of six months and 10 years are being given the vaccine in two half doses separated by 21 days because their immune systems are not as developed as those of adults.</p>
<p>For some parents, the sudden death of a 13-year-old Toronto boy with H1N1, which made headlines Tuesday, was enough to convince them to get their children immunized.</p>
<p>"It's too late for that kid," said Cindy Smith of Windsor as she waited in line with her husband Tyler and their sons, two-year-old Oden and seven-month-old Ajax. When she read about the young hockey player, who died shortly after developing flu-like symptoms, Smith gathered her family and headed to the flu shot clinic, unwilling to wait until another one opens in Windsor Thursday.</p>
<p>"We're not waiting. We don't want to take any chances," she said.</p>
<p>It took a total of two hours of waiting for Karl Masse and his two daughters, Kassandra, 8, and Karissa, 6, to get the shot. "It's for my kids, mainly, I want to take care of them," Masse said. He said it's been "nerve wracking" hearing about children getting sick and dying from H1N1. The wait went pretty smoothly, he said, and Kassandra reported the shot felt like "a pinch."</p>
<p>Early in the day, most people waited up to an hour to see a nurse and get the H1N1 shot, but the wait was longer as the day went on.</p>
<p>Jim Sauter, 55, said he was reluctant to get the shot until his wife convinced him that, as an asthma sufferer, he risked getting seriously ill and ending up in hospital.</p>
<p>"I also thought about my grandchildren -- what if I got sick and passed it on to them?" he said. "But I definitely understand why people are scared to get it. We don't know how effective it is and what the long-term effects are."</p>
<p>John Sabga, 69, arrived to get the shot at 3 p.m., and seeing the long line decided to go leave and come back later. When he came back, he learned the line had been closed. "I'll get it one way or another," he said. "I just want to be protected, plus I have heart problems so I should get it."</p>
<p>The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is aiming to immunize high-risk groups first -- those with pre-existing and chronic conditions, pregnant women and people under 30, since they appear to be more susceptible to the complications of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Medical officer of health Dr. Allen Heimann said doses of the H1N1 vaccine have been shipped to some doctors' offices in the area. He said the health unit is trying to make the vaccine available to physicians who have a large roster of patients and especially those who care for pregnant women and children. People should check with their family doctors to see if they will be providing the vaccine.</p>
<p>There have been 68 local lab-confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu, Heimann said.</p>
<p>The next public H1N1 flu shot clinic will be held Thursday at the Windsor Knights of Columbus hall on 2401 Columbus St., from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>For a complete list of all clinic dates, visit the health unit's website at www.wechealthunit.org[http://www.wechealthunit.org] or call the H1N1 hotline at 519-258-2146, ext. 1433.</p>

<p>Chances of the H1N1 vaccine going terribly wonky are pegged at a million-to-one. Those are pretty good odds.</p>
<p>If you don't get the vaccine, chances are four-to-one you will get sick. Those odds come courtesy of your friendly neighborhood epidemiologist who is, after all , in the business of calculating such risks.</p>
<p>With that information, getting the H1N1 shot would seem a no-brainer. Yet, according to polls, approximately 50 per cent of Canadians have no plans to get vaccinated. This rather significant percentage has certainly caught the attention of the medical community in our country.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler Jones, has urged everyone to get vaccinated, if not for themselves, then for the vulnerable population at large.</p>
<p>If you are someone choosing to not get an H1N1 or seasonal flu shot, we recommend you reconsider that decision. That said, we also fully respect your right to make that choice for yourself and/or your family.</p>
<p>Most importantly, we do not support bullying from either side in this debate. Telling someone who does not want a shot that his or her actions are reckless and selfish does no one any good.</p>

</p>
<p>Lee Christensen's trip to Prince Edward Island for the 2009 World Junior A Hockey Challenge included a visit to the doctor's office Tuesday.</p>
<p>Christensen, one of only two Saskatchewan Junior Hockey League players named to the Canada West team, hasn't had much luck in the health department this season.</p>
<p>"It's been terrible -- terrible timing," Christensen, a Melfort Mustangs' defenceman, said Tuesday via cellphone from Summerside, P.E.I., where Team West is busy preparing for the tournament.</p>
<p>"I'm not feeling so good. We practised this morning -- I skated and everything -- but I'm told I have to stay away from the team, basically, for a couple of days until I'm better."</p>
<p>The young blue-liner has already missed eight of 13 games during the SJHL's regular season due to a shoulder injury. Now, he appears to be the victim of some form of influenza.</p>
<p>"They tested me for it (H1N1 virus), but I don't know if it is," Christensen explained. "Either way, I have to stay away so I don't get anybody else sick."</p>
<p>The 2009 World Junior A Challenge runs Nov. 1-8.</p>
<p>"It's huge," said Christensen, who hails from Winnipeg. "It's very exciting. Playing for your country, for Team West representing Western Canada, is awesome."</p>
<p>Christensen, 18, is a former standout for the Winnipeg Midget AAA Wild.</p>
<p>"Lee is a really skilled offensive defenceman," says Mustangs coach and general manager Darrell Mann. "He was at regionals for the Winnipeg Wild at Swift Current. He was the top defenceman there. Unfortunately, he's been a guy who has been hurt for us here for most of the season, but, in exhibition, he was without a doubt the best defenceman on our hockey club."</p>
<p>The 6-foot-1, 170-pound Christensen is joined on the Canada West squad by Yorkton Terriers' winger Clarke Breitkreuz, a native of Springside, who leads Yorkton with six goals and eight assists for 14 points in 15 games.</p>
<p>"It's too bad (there are only two SJHLers)," noted Mann. "You look at the young guys who are in our league and, unfortunately, we don't pick the team."</p>
<p>Canada West has appeared in the gold-medal game at all three previous World Junior A Challenges, winning gold in 2006 at Yorkton and 2007 at Trail, B.C., before settling for silver last year in Camrose, Alta..</p>
<p>The Canada West roster is comprised of 11 players from the British Columbia Hockey League (BCHL), four players from the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL), four from the Manitoba Junior Hockey League (MJHL), one from the Superior International Junior Hockey League (SIJHL) and two SJHLers.</p>
<p>"After a high-intensity camp in Okotoks, (Alta.), last month, we are confident we have chosen the right players who can bring the gold medal back to Canada West," said head coach Rylan Ferster (Salmon Arm, BCHL).</p>
<p>The selection process involved extensive scouting by Ferster, general manager Leonard Strandberg of Melfort and assistant coaches Barry Butler (Waywayseecappo, MJHL) and Larry Wintoneak (Kindersley).</p>
<p>Canada West will play in Group A at the Junior A Challenge, joined by Russia and Sweden, while Canada East, Belarus and the United States will make up Group B.</p>
<p>The gold-medal game, which will be shown nationally on TSN/RDS, is Sunday, Nov. 8. All preliminary round games, quarter-finals, semifinals and the bronze-medal game can be seen live via webcast through FASTHockey at hockeycanada.fasthockey.com.</p>
<p>PLAYERS OF THE WEEK</p>
<p>Clarke Breitkreuz of the Yorkton Terriers is the SJHL's player of the week after scoring two goals and three assists in two games this past week.</p>
<p>Defenceman of the week honours go to Harrison Tribble of the Melfort Mustangs. The 20-year-old D-man, from Carstairs, Alta., has been a key player in Melfort's comeback from a slow start. The Mustangs have gone 4-0-1-1 in their last six games. Offensively, Tribble generated a goal and three assists in two games last week.</p>
<p>The SJHL's goalie of the week is Adam Bartko of the La Ronge Ice Wolves. Bartko, 19, is getting an opportunity to play frequently and he's taking advantage of it. He blanked the Estevan Bruins with a 37-save shutout on Sunday night after turning away 36 of 38 shots against Kindersley earlier in the week. He finished the week with a 2-0 record, 1.0 goals-against average and .973 save-percentage.</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu has claimed the lives of three more people in B.C. since Oct. 20, bringing the number of dead since April to 12.</p>
<p>In 11 of the 12 deaths, the patients suffered underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>There have been an additional 21 new cases admitted to intensive-care units in the last week, authorities said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Travis Hottes, an influenza epidemiologist with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said the increase in deaths and severe cases was "significant."</p>
<p>"It's not unexpected," said Hotte, adding that the activity levels are higher than in an average season, but he couldn't predict exactly where the province is in terms of the pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's probably a little too early to tell," he said.</p>
<p>Since Oct. 20, there have been 88 new severe cases. The majority of those cases, 43, occurred in the Fraser Health region, which has the most cases (87) and the most deaths (seven).</p>
<p>Vancouver Coastal has the second-highest number of severe cases requiring hospitalization (60) but only one death.</p>
<p>There have been 31 severe cases in the Interior, including three deaths, while there have been 15 severe cases and one death on Vancouver Island and six severe cases in the Northern Health region.</p>
<p>There have now been a total of 199 lab-confirmed H1N1 cases that required hospitalization, with 51 being admitted to intensive care units.</p>
<p>According to the provincial health ministry, only severe cases are being included in the statistics. The majority of lab-confirmed cases in the province have been mild or moderate in severity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, public interest in information on H1N1 is straining government health helplines.</p>
<p>Record numbers of calls to 811, the flu information line, and visits to the website healthlinkbc.ca are being made.</p>
<p>The current daily volume of calls to 811 is around 4,000, about four times the normal rate. The website is receiving 8,500 visitors daily, about a third of which are using the site's H1N1 symptom checker. That rate is more than twice what's normally seen.</p>
<p>Health Minister Kevin Falcon announced yesterday that 24 more lines, staffed by 40 registered nurses and health professionals, will go active as of this morning.</p>
<p>Fraser Health chief medical officer, Dr. Roland Guasparini, defended his health agency's strategy, which doesn't include any public clinics until next week, even though Vancouver Coastal Health has already begun public clinics.</p>
<p>He said the 70,000 doses of vaccine that Fraser Health received this week went to the region's roughly 1,200 doctors, who are prioritizing vaccinations.</p>

</p>
<p>Patients who need public health services have a couple more weeks before operations wind down so health-care workers can focus their efforts on combating the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region says public health centres remain open as usual until Nov. 9, when services will be scaled back significantly to run public immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Clinics have already started this week in Saskatoon to immunize health-care workers in hospitals and long-term care homes. Until Nov. 6, health-care workers based in the community (such as at private doctors' offices) can go to public health clinics to be immunized against H1N1.</p>
<p>As of Nov. 9, public health services in the health region will only be open for routine immunization of infants aged two months, four months, six months and 12 months. Patients' parents should book appointments at public health centres for these immunizations.</p>
<p>Public health services are expected to return to normal once public H1N1 immunization clinics wind down.</p>
<p>Starting today, the health region has opened its "4-Flu" information line. Workers can answer questions between 8 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on weekdays, or a message can be returned on the next business day. Call 306-655-4358.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan so far has received 112,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine -- enough to immunize one-10th of the province's population.</p>
<p>Across the country, the vaccine is distributed on a per-capita basis, said Rick Trimp, executive director of the Ministry of Health's population health branch.</p>
<p>"Health-care workers have been identified as the first priority across Canada," Trimp said. "Some (jurisdictions) have opened up their vaccination clinics for the high-risk groups as well. Right now, Canada hasn't received its full allotment of vaccine; it's coming out on a weekly basis. As we get more and more vaccine, we will be moving up those going to the priority list."</p>
<p>Trimp said there is sporadic H1N1 virus activity throughout the province.</p>
<p>He said Canada's second wave of the H1N1 influenza began in B.C. and is moving through Alberta and Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>"It's making its way from west to east, but we're starting to see places like Ottawa with cases," Trimp said.</p>
<p>"It's becoming quite widespread and it's no different in Saskatchewan."</p>

</p>
<p>Exercise is a known immunity booster, which is why Health Canada recommends regular workouts as part of its strategy to protect against the H1N1 virus. But is the gym the best place to avoid the flu, or is the shared equipment and sweaty population prime breeding ground for a virus that experts say has reached pandemic status?</p>
<p>"You're more likely to get the flu from the guy on the treadmill next to you than from the treadmill itself," said Dalius Briedis, an infectious-disease specialist at the McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>H1N1 is predominantly transferred from individual to individual through aerosol droplets in the air - which means being coughed on by someone beside you is the most likely way for the flu to be transmitted. So, the first step in staying healthy is asking exercisers to avoid the gym when they are sick.</p>
<p>That being said, Briedis noted that it is possible for the virus to stay viable for a short period of time on a hard surface like a piece of fitness equipment. Therefore it's prudent to take extra precautions when using equipment that is passed from one exerciser to the next, like cardio and weight training machines, exercise balls and dumbbells.</p>
<p>"If you come in contact with the virus and then touch your face, nose or eyes, it's possible to get the flu," said Briedis.</p>
<p>Wiping down equipment with a cleaning solution after use, draping a clean towel over an exercise mat or bench and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after a workout should be standard practice in gyms across the country.</p>
<p>But gym rats aren't the only exercisers who need to take special precautions when it comes to avoiding the flu. According to Briedis sport teams are also at increased risk of exposure to the H1N1 virus. The proximity of athletes to each other and to their personal belongings makes the virus easy to pass along from one teammate to the next. And once the flu hits one team member, there's no telling how quickly it will spread and the kind of impact it can have on a team's ability to field enough players to compete.</p>
<p>A look back in history suggests that the flu can have devastating effects on a team.</p>
<p>"In the winter of 1918/19, the Stanley Cup playoffs were cancelled due to an outbreak of the Spanish flu," said Briedis. "Four members of the Canadiens team got sick and one died."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the H1N1 virus has been linked to a small number of fatalities worldwide and, for the most part, results in a moderate fever, fatigue and aches and pains, which in a healthy population means spending a few days in bed recuperating. But that doesn't mean it can be treated lightly by teams and leagues across the country.</p>
<p>Simple precautions can reduce the risk. Water bottles and towels shouldn't be shared between athletes (all towels should be removed from team benches) and a protocol should be in place to keep sick athletes away from their healthy teammates.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends quarantining an athlete until they are symptom-free (no coughing or fever) for 24 hours. If an athlete gets sick on the road, they should be put in a private room and wear a mask during the bus ride home where they should sit as far away from their teammates as possible.</p>
<p>The same goes for the sick athlete's roommate, who should be kept under a watchful eye for three days before being placed back on the playing roster.</p>
<p>As for the ritual of shaking hands after a game, Briedis isn't in favour of suspending this age-old tradition. With physical contact a natural consequence of most team sports, there is little to be gained by forgoing shaking hands, especially if athletes wash their hands or use hand sanitizers immediately after the game.</p>
<p>The ritual Briedis is in favour of forgoing, however, is the Montreal two-cheek kiss, which he claims should be suspended until after the H1N1 virus runs its course.</p>
<p>If the flu does strike, the decision to exercise or compete is probably moot as fever and the associated aches and pains will relegate all but the hardiest to bed until the symptoms abate. The average time to recuperate is three to seven days, after which exercisers are encouraged to get back in the game or gym slowly.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends waiting for 24 hours after the fever has abated before resuming light exercise. A body recuperating from flu is quick to fatigue, so respect the signals your body is sending and take it easy if you feel less than 100 per cent during your workout.</p>
<p>Precautions should also be taken before exercising in the cold, especially if your flu symptoms included a cough. Cold air can further irritate already inflamed bronchial pathways, causing a rebound case of bronchitis and another couple of days in bed.</p>
<p>Once you feel up to speed, go ahead and resume your normal workouts. Exercise is still the best medicine for a healthy mind and body.</p>

<p>The following discussion was originally published on Oct. 23, 2009 and was conducted live from 1-2 p.m. ET. It has been edited for clarity and to better help answer your questions on swine flu/H1N1. Read the transcript from the original discussion here. (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/science/our-experts-answered-your-swine-flu-questions/article1335617/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/science/our-experts-answered-your-swine-flu-questions/article1335617/])</p>
<p>Caroline Alphonso: Welcome everyone to our H1N1 discussion with Dr. Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency of Health Protection and Promotion. Health Canada approved the vaccine on Wednesday, and local public health authorities are embarking on mass vaccination clinics starting the week of Oct. 25 across the country. This is the country's largest immunization campaign.</p>
<p>The following questions were posed to Dr. Gardam from readers.</p>
<p>Q: Do you as a doctor feel safe taking the H1N1 flu shot? I mean the Canadian studies aren't even done yet! I for one won't be taking the shot!</p>
<p>A: I actually had planned to get my shot this morning but our hospital hasn't received it yet--hopefully I can get it Monday. This vaccine is like any other vaccine or drug -- we don't need Canadian studies to say that they are safe and effective. The data for this vaccine come from Europe. The Canadian studies are more about fine tuning the vaccination process...</p>
<p>Q: My son is 3 1/2, recently had an asthma attack for first time, should he get the vaccine with or without the adjuvant?</p>
<p>A: I think your son should get the adjuvanted vaccine. Here is why: He is in the age group that is likely to get infected; he has asthma which is a risk factor for more severe flu; the adjuvanted vaccine gives a better immune response than the unadjuvanted vaccine (it works better); and it is available now, whereas the unadjuvanted vaccine won't be available for awhile.</p>
<p>Q: My son has epilepsy and everything that I read leads me to agree that he needs the vaccine. I am nervous, however, as you hear so many conflicting reports regarding the safety of the vaccine. I have always believed in vaccination, but this time I am very worried. What are your take on the safety of this vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The reality is that there really are not any credible reports about any safety issues with the vaccine. we have been giving flu shots for decades ... this is just another flu shot. The only difference is the adjuvant, which has been used in millions of people around the world. The adjuvant is made up of two natural fats: vitamin E and squalene which is a molecule your body makes (the squalene in the vaccine comes from fish oil). I'm giving it to my kids without any worries.</p>
<p>Q: I have just received innoculation for the seasonal flu. ... when should I receive the HiNI flu shot ? I am over 65 years of age?</p>
<p>A: There is no reason why you can't get the H1N1 vaccine as well. The good news is you are more likely than someone under-65 to already have protective immunity to H1N1 (so you are less likely to get infected), but if you do get infected, you have a higher risk than someone younger of ending up really sick. So bottom line, I would get it.</p>
<p>Q: I am over 65 and am a doctor. Should I get the H1N1 shot first, wait for a while and then get the regular flu shot? Or the other way round? or both together? Is it necessary to wait a specified period of time between the two flu shots?</p>
<p>A: You can get both shots at the same time, one in each arm.</p>
<p>Q: Myself and two of my children have already had the flu this season (we're in Vancouver and our school has been hit hard). We don't know for sure if it was H1N1, but it likely was. Do we still need to be vacinated?</p>
<p>A: Eventhough we had a peak of flu last spring going into the summer, the reality is that the majority of people who had symptoms during that time did not have H1N1 - there were other viruses circulating in the community at that time. Certainly if you had a positive test for H1N1 I don't think you need to run out and get vaccinated, but otherwise, the odds are you didn't have H1N1.</p>
<p>Q: There is so much controversy about the vaccine - in fact, several friends' doctors advised them not to get the vaccine for themselves or their young children. I am surprised at this but don't know why their doctors are advising that. It makes me even more nervous to hear that and even though my own doctor advised me to get the vaccine, I am confused. What are people afraid of?</p>
<p>A: As sad as it is for me to type this, not all doctors know what they are talking about. Much of our education has actually been aimed at doctors to make sure that they have the facts straight. There is almost no reason why somebody shouldn't get vaccinated ... it all comes down to whether you want to prevent yourself from getting the flu.</p>
<p>Q: I'm running the New York marathon on Nov. 1st. What, if any, are the possible down sides of getting the vaccine so close to race day? Should I just wait until I return to get my vaccination?</p>
<p>A: I love the marathon question, being crazy enough to do that kind of running myself. I definitely would get the vaccine. You don't want to be coughing up a lung on race day. You are going to be miserable enough as it is. Hope you get a PR.</p>
<p>Q: Have clinical studies showed any negative effects to getting the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>A: There are studies and lots and lots of experience with components of this vaccine in millions of people that all say this vaccine is safe. There are no data saying it isn't safe.</p>
<p>Q: I'm concerned about the adjuvant squaline that is being added to the vaccine. This is the same substance that was added to the anthrax vaccine and was implicated in causing Gulf War Syndrome in American soldiers. I've heard people say this theory has been debunked, but I continue to hear evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>A: I am glad you brought this up. If squalene is a problem, then we are all in trouble as we are all making it in our livers right now. It is a natural compound produced by your body. And the anthrax vaccine story is wrong. There was no squalene in that vaccine and it has never been scientifically linked to Gulf War syndrome. When people get sick they look for something to blame and vaccines seem to make a nice, easy target.</p>
<p>Q: Could you please talk about pregnant women? I understand the numbers in terms of risk of contracting the illness, but not in terms of getting seriously ill. Scary news stories have covered women dying/losing their babies who have underlying conditions/are smokers, etc. (mostly glossing over those facts), but what are the risks of getting really sick as a regular, healthy pregnant woman? And what are those risks vs the risks of getting the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The risk of a pregnant woman contracting flu is the same as a non-pregnant woman. The risk of a pregnant woman getting really sick and potentially dying from flu is about 4-5 fold higher though. This has been shown consistently throughout this pandemic in multiple countries. The absolute risk of getting really sick though is still very small even if you are pregnant. I can't give you an exact numbers because that kind of data is not yet available.</p>
<p>Think of it this way: There is a small but documented risk of serious disease if you are pregnant, and serious disease is definitely a risk to your fetus. On the other hand, there is no evidence that any component of this vaccine is harmful to your fetus.</p>
<p>Q: My family has been sick but we were not tested. I realize testing everyone is time consuming and expensive but if I knew that I have already had, and survived, the swine flu I could then stop worrying for the rest of the winter (I worry about my kids as one has asthma and I have emphsyma) and my vaccine could go to some other person or country that may be short vaccines so in that sense why is testing not done on all people that show all the signs?</p>
<p>A: Lots of people want to know if they have had this already. The problem is there is no good routine lab test to figure that out. We can look for antibodies but this is only done in a small number of research labs and the test is not that good...and this is not unique to Canada; all labs are having the same issue.</p>
<p>Q: Dr. Gardam, I have a question that isn't related to vaccinations. I understand that complications from H1N1 is highest in certain vulnerable groups (e.g. immunocompromised) but there was recently a story about the young and healthy woman from B.C. who died from H1N1. Are you able to comment on this?</p>
<p>A: Yes a fair percentage of people who have died from H1N1 around the world have had no identifiable risk factors.</p>
<p>Q: Is it true the H1N1 flu vaccine is still being tested on the public? Is it true that tests do not mean the future side effect are known? Would it be better for a person over 65 to just have the regular flu shot than take a gamble on future problems from the H1N1 flu vaccine?? Lots of people do not trust this vaccine!</p>
<p>A: This vaccine is being treated like any other vaccine. One cannot do studies of millions of people before licensing so there is what we call post licensing surveillance where people report in very rare side effects.</p>
<p>Q: I am breastfeeding a three month old and considering getting the vaccine so that I don't get H1N1 and pass it to my baby and toddler (or be too sick to properly take care of them). However, I'm concerned that in the few days after I get the vaccine, my breastmilk will contain too much of the vaccine for my baby. I'm also concerned about the adjuvant. I know they have no clinical results for adjuvants in pregnant women but do they have clinical results to show it is safe in breastfeeding women? Should I dump my breastmilk for a few days after the vaccine or avoid getting the vaccine altogether since I will be breastfeeding?</p>
<p>A: No significant amounts of the vaccine will get into breast milk. And again, the adjuvant is vitamin E and squalene - your child is already producing squalene naturally. It is definitely a good idea for you to do as you say - get vaccinated to protect your baby.</p>
<p>Q: What is the age cut off for needing 2 shots of H1N1 instead of just one in children?</p>
<p>A: Kids six months to nine years old should get two half dose shots. This dosing schedule may be modified as additional trial information becomes available.</p>
<p>Q: "There is almost no reason why somebody shouldn't get vaccinated, it all comes down to whether you want to prevent yourself from getting the flu." Don't mind getting the flu - what I'd like to avoid is two weeks in a heart/lung machine and/or death. I think that's the issue for many. Getting sick occasionally isn't a big deal. Dying or killing someone else IS.</p>
<p>A: Yes you are right, nobody wants to get really sick from this. It is important for people to be aware that the risk of serious illness if you are otherwise healthy is small, but not zero.</p>
<p>Q: Why does the Globe continue to call this the Swine Flu instead of H1N1... continuing to use this term. only further damages our pork industry.</p>
<p>A: The term swine flu is common parlance. It was originally called swine flu by the World Health Organization. We make sure we refer to it as H1N1 as well. It is important that are stories be readable and accessible to the public, not overloaded with jargon.</p>
<p>Q: If a 65+ person has been vaccinated as early as this month with the seasonal flu vaccine. Do they need to be re-vaccinated again in the spring as their immunity tends to wears out after a few months?</p>
<p>A: You will likely be OK if you got your shot recently, you shouldn't need to be revaccinated this spring. Keep tuned to the public health advice this spring in case something changes</p>
<p>Q: What's the preservative that they're using in the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The preservative in the vaccine is thimerosol. This is another one of those molecules that people get worried about, because it contains mercury. The amount of mercury in a typical vaccine is the same as in less than in a can of tuna. Thimerosol has NEVER been credibly linked to any health problems, including autism, this is despite researchers trying very very hard to find a link.</p>
<p>Q: Is the nasal spray safer for children and is it available in Ontario?</p>
<p>A: The nasal spray is not available in Canada.</p>
<p>Q: Should I be concerned about GBS? Also why can children under 6 months not get the vaccine for H1N1?</p>
<p>A: Six month olds aren't vaccinated because it doesn't work, their immune system is too young to respond to the vaccine. That is why we recommend those around them get vaccinated.</p>
<p>GBS (Guillan Barre syndrome) was associated with the swine flu vaccine in 1976 and never since. An association does not mean that it was caused by the vaccine, only that they were associated (like saying that umbrellas are associated with rain, doesn't mean they cause rain). The association that year was a possible increase of 1 case per 100 000 people vaccinated. Please note:</p>
<p>that is pretty small;the risk of getting GBS from having natural flu infection is greater than that;the risk of serious complications from the flu is much greater than that; andMost cases of GBS are actually caused by infections including food poisoning. So GBS, like the adjuvant and thimerosol, are red herrings.</p>
<p>Q: There is a lot of criticism that the media is scare-mongering and confusing the public about H1N1. As a senior public health offiicial what do you think about what you read in the paper and see on TV. Is it confusing?</p>
<p>A: In general, I don't think there has been scare-mongering. Most of the coverage I have seen has been just fine. I think the biggest problem we have all faced is that flu is very very confusing, shows up in different ways and different places, and we are always looking for more information to better understand what might happen. This uncertainty means that you will see some variation in reports and that can be confusing.</p>
<p>Q: My wife is pregnant, and we're confused about the H1N1 vaccine. Would you recommend she get the vaccine available in Toronto next week, or should she wait for the adjuvant-free version? (We were surprised when her midwife suggested she go ahead and get the version available next week.) Also, which one should our two-year-old son get?</p>
<p>A: I understand your confusion Re: which vaccine for your wife. The current recommendation is that if she is less than 20 weeks and otherwise healthy, she can probably wait if she wants to get the non-adjuvanted vaccine - this is because the first trimester of pregnancy is not at increased risk of severe disease - not because of safety concerns with the adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>If she is more than 20 weeks or less than 20 weeks with underlying medical problems I think it makes the most sense to get the adjuvanted vaccine now so that she is protected as soon as possible as the country is just heading into its fall wave of flu right now.</p>
<p>Q: I would really like to know about masks -- why aren't Canadians wearing them on a daily basis in public?</p>
<p>A: Katie, surprisingly we have no data on how well masks work when worn by the general public. I think it makes sense if you are sick and coughing, and have to go out, that you wear a mask.....but nobody knows how much others wearing masks around you will protect them. We wear them (or respirators) in healthcare but also stress hand washing and may wear glowns, gloves and eye protection as well.</p>
<p>Bottom line, I have no problem with people doing that if they want, I just don't know how much it will help. I personally don't wear a mask on the subway but I definitely wash my hands a lot.</p>
<p>Q: With three family members who have died from three different autoimmune diseases, and many living with other autoimmune diseases, I'm concerned the adjuvant may trigger an underlying autoimmune disease. Can you comment on this?</p>
<p>A: This is a very tricky question that is currently being discussed and I suggest that people with serious autoimmune diseases such as lupus should talk to their immunologists about it. Again, one would have to weigh that theoretical risk versus the real risk that someone with severe autoimmune diseases is going to be at increased risk for getting bad disease from the flu.</p>
<p>Q: It was rather difficult to get the death rate attributed to influenza. Would you know it. This is for people worrying about neurological complication of 1 in a million. However hard to argue when you dont' t know the complication rate and death rate for influenza.</p>
<p>A: We don't know the actual risk of death per people infected because we don't have a good handle on the number of people infected. This is a problem all over the world because you just can't test everybody. Many people with flu won't even seek healthcare.</p>
<p>The estimates I have seen of the risk of serious disease, especially in people with underlying illnesses is certainly greater than the risk of serious adverse events from the flu shot.</p>
<p>Q: I'm a nurse and required to get a flu shot every year and I'm wondering what the cumulative effect that thimerosol will have if I'm taking one, or in this case, two flu shots per year.</p>
<p>A: There isn't a lot of thimerosol in the vaccine as I mentioned before, you are exposed to many many fold more mercury just by living in a industrialized country. Also, if your previous flu shots were given from single preloaded syringes, there was no thimerosol in the vaccine (it is only put in multidose vials). I've had at least 15 seasonal flu shots so I am right there with you.</p>
<p>Q: Can you clarify the situation with egg allergy as an absolute contraindication for the H1N1 vaccine? If you have a positive response to egg antigen with skin testing, but no symptoms at all when you eat eggs, can you have the vaccine?</p>
<p>A: The only time we worry about egg allergies is if someone has had true anaphylaxis to eggs (difficulty breathing, asthma, facial swelling etc.).</p>
<p>Q: How long does it take for the vaccine to provide immunity/to reach full effectiveness?</p>
<p>A: It takes about 10-14 days to develop immunity post vaccine. It may be a bit quicker with the adjuvanted vaccine because it works so well.</p>
<p>Q: I'm generally healthy and getting by the flu season fine without any flu shots in the past. But my boyfriend and I will go to Mexico for a week in mid November. Would that be an added motive for us to get the shot, or this virus has no particular correlation with Mexico any more? We are both in our early 30s.</p>
<p>A: There really isn't a link to Mexico anymore. I would just get it in the off chance you get flu while down there and it screws up your holiday. Nothing worse than sitting on the beach hacking up a lung.</p>
<p>Q: I have heard that in our Ontario hospitals, few people have died because of the vaccine, so everyone is pretty freaked out. Have you heard any of that?</p>
<p>A: Nobody has died because of the vaccine. But many people have died from H1N1 before the vaccine was available.</p>
<p>Q: Some people believe that taking the flu shot every year for the "run of the mill flu" defeats the purpose of building up the body's natural immunity. This year maybe people like that are thinking "I don't want to die from the big one, so I better get a shot this year". Is it fair to say this kind of thinking misses the fact that getting a shot every year has the same affect of building up immunity?</p>
<p>A: Yes you are correct. Getting a shot is the same thing as getting the flu in terms of developing immunity, only with the shot, you don't have to go through actually getting sick. which is one of the main reasons why I get it every year.</p>

<p>Paul Frustaglio spent the first days of his son's short life on the floor.</p>
<p>After he and his wife, Ann-Marie, brought Evan home from the hospital he couldn't help but worry that he firstborn might stop breathing.</p>
<p>“I slept on the floor in the room and I was just making sure he breathed all night, I just didn't want to leave his side,” Mr. Frustaglio recalled.</p>
<p>Yesterday his fears came true.</p>
<p>Less than 13 years and two months after he brought Evan home from the hospital, the 46-year-old father found his son collapsed on the bathroom floor. He called 911 and tried frantically to resuscitate Evan before paramedics arrived.</p>
<p>The healthy Grade 8 student and star hockey player died a short time later of what Mr. Frustaglio later learned was H1N1.</p>
<p>He was the 30th to die in Ontario since the H1N1 outbreak began, one of a small fraction of the flu's casualties who seemed in perfect health before they died.</p>

</p>
<p>Evan and his team were part of a 48-team minor hockey tournament that ran from Friday through Sunday at London's Western Fair Sports Centre, drawing teams from both sides of the U.S. border, said Stephen Firth, president of the London Rep Hockey Association.</p>
<p>In all, Mr. Firth gauged that close to 700 youths aged 13, 14 and 15 would have participated.</p>
<p>Evan's team, the Mississauga Senators, played three games in all, none against any London teams. They played against the Michigan Jaguars, and two teams from Toronto – North Toronto and the Ajax Knights.</p>
<p>Mr. Firth said he learned of Evan's death on Monday night, in a call from the Stratford-based Minor Hockey Alliance, adding that so far there is no sense of panic among London residents.</p>
<p>“But everybody I've talked to is surprised at the apparent speed” with which the flu claimed Evan's life.</p>
<p>“That's one of the oddities – that the boy who succumbed was very healthy and very athletic.”</p>
<p>At its regular meeting Wednesday night, the Minor Hockey Alliance will be reviewing options, he said.</p>
<p>He'd complained of a sore throat but managed to have a strong game on Saturday evening in a narrow loss that left the competitive right wing forward frustrated.</p>
<p>Like many boys his age, Evan was an eater. (He loved steak and had ordered escargot at a fancy restaurant to celebrate his 13th birthday with his family.) That night, after a dinner out with teammates, Evan began feeling sick.</p>
<p>Ms. Frustaglio said he developed “a slight fever and coughing” that progressed until he started vomiting.</p>
<p>The next day, Sunday, she backed up their bags and they drove home to Toronto.</p>
<p>That afternoon, as Evan's nausea continued, the Frustaglios became concerned and took their son to a walk-in clinic.</p>
<p>“In essence, the doctor checked him,” said Mr. Frustaglio. “He said his lungs were fine, he didn't prescribe us any meds whatsoever, he just said keep him on the Tylenol and some Gravol for his vomiting and just keep an eye on him.”</p>
<p>Evan continued to vomit through the night, but appeared to be making a recovery by yesterday morning – the vomiting had stopped and his fever was gone.</p>
<p>Shortly after Evan took a bath his father knocked on the bathroom door to check on him.</p>
<p>“I went in and he was lying on the ground and I said, ‘Evan, Come on, you got to get up off the floor!'” Mr. Frustaglio said. “So I went to pick him up and he started to get up and he essentially collapsed as I was carrying him.”</p>
<p>Both Evan and his younger brother, Will, 10, had had the flu before. Mr. Frustaglio said it wasn't until he saw the helpless look on his son's face as he lay limp on the bathroom floor that he realized that this wasn't a regular flu.</p>
<p>“All I can tell people is just watch your children and if they don't seem right to you, don't hesitate to get medical attention,” he said. “And if somebody says, Oh it's just the flu, that's not a good enough answer.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Answering questions on the H1N1 virus and pregnancy</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>

<p>Physician Paul Le Guerrier of the infectious diseases unit of the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency explains pregnancy and H1N1 vaccine issues:</p>
<p>Gazette: What are the recommendations for pregnancy?</p>
<p>Answer: The official recommendation from national health authorities and specialists is that women who are pregnant less than 20 weeks should preferably receive the unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. Those in advanced stages of pregnancy, more than 20 weeks, can get the adjuvanted one. The Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada, however, says that if the virus is circulating in the community, which is our case, that these women could get the adjuvanted vaccine because there is no data suggesting it is dangerous.</p>
<p>G: Why is the unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine preferred?</p>
<p>A: For the same reason we don't usually recommend medication and vaccines in pregnant women - it's touchy in respect to fetal growth. Pregnant women are not part of safety tests because we don't want to take any risks on their babies. Doctors have to weigh the risks vs. the benefits in every case, and that's what the experts are doing with the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>G: What's in the adjuvant?</p>
<p>A: It's made of three substances: an emulsifier that mixes water and oil, called polysorbate 80, you find it in ice cream, it's a compound used in the food industry; vitamin E; and the third component is a fish oil called Squalene, an organic compound that is produced in the body as a form of cholesterol. And those three together have been found to induce a better immune response and more antibodies.</p>
<p>The reason we are using this is because the World Health Organization has asked for more vaccines to better cover the world population. We can make four times more vaccine with the adjuvant.</p>
<p>G: Does a woman getting the H1N1 shot also vaccinate her unborn baby?</p>
<p>A: It does not immunize the baby. But the mother will produce antibodies and an immune response and she will pass on her antibodies through the placenta to the baby. We call that passive immunity, and it will protect the baby during the first six months of life.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadians swamp clinics; Vaccine imported for pregnant women</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK and JANICE TIBBETTS    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>

<p>Day 1 of the largest mass vaccination program in history saw at-risk Canadians waiting in long queues to receive the H1N1 needle.</p>
<p>Lines containing hundreds of people snaked through shopping malls, local arenas and community centres as Canadians believed to be most at risk of serious flu complications lined up.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, a west-end clinic had to turn away prospective patients after it became clear by mid-afternoon that the wait time was about four hours and not everyone would be getting a shot.</p>
<p>In Calgary, people began lining up before dawn for their shots at all four of the city clinics, with as many as 800 people crowded outside one shopping mall venue when the doors opened.</p>
<p>Similar scenes played out in Victoria and in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada has bought additional H1N1 vaccine from Australia so that pregnant woman can get their recommended shot sooner than expected, the federal government announced.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said she signed a special order to allow for the purchase of 200,000 doses of the unadjuvanted version of the vaccine from a manufacturer called CSL Australia.</p>
<p>Canada is awaiting the production and approval of 1.8 million doses from its own manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, on track to be delivered in early November.</p>
<p>The version of the vaccine with an adjuvant, or booster, was made first and is being administered to Canadians across the country.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said the additional supply of unadjuvanted vaccine was secured because of the rising rates of H1N1 cases in Canada.</p>
<p>"While the order being produced by GSK in Canada is still on target for delivery in early November, we felt that given the increase in cases of H1N1 flu virus across the country it was prudent to offer pregnant women earlier access to the unadjuvanted vaccine," the minister said at a news conference.</p>
<p>"It should be sufficient to cover the majority of pregnant women and certainly all those, I think, that want the vaccine," chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said of the order.</p>

<p>H1N1 precautions</p>
<p>After hearing that the federal government is granting paid sick leave to pregnant women whose jobs fall under federal labour laws in the event of an H1N1 outbreak, I have become incredibly frustrated. Only 10 per cent of our workforce is regulated by federal labour laws, the other 90 per cent by provincial labour laws.</p>
<p>The Quebec provincial government is granting paid leave to pregnant women covered by its provincial labour laws, so what is Ontario doing to protect our unborn children?</p>
<p>I am currently five-and-a-half-months pregnant and work in a position where I regularly deal with the public. As I will be in my third trimester when flu season begins, I am becoming increasingly concerned about the potential for serious complications should I contract the virus.</p>
<p>As of this moment, my only option in the event of an outbreak is to start my maternity leave early. Under the current guidelines, this means that I will not receive any compensation until I am eight weeks away from my due date and will shorten the amount of time I will be able to stay home to care for my daughter after her birth.</p>
<p>Is this really what is best for my child? What is the Ontario government doing to protect pregnant women and our children?</p>
