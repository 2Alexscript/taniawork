<p>MEXICO CITY</p>
<p>Soccer</p>
<p>South Americans refuse</p>
<p>to host Mexican teams</p>
<p>Colombia and Chile turned down a proposal yesterday to host two Mexican clubs' Copa Libertadores matches, fearing the players might bring swine flu with them.</p>
<p>Chivas and San Luis qualified for the round of 16 in the Copa Libertadores, the Latin American club championship.</p>
<p>"We love soccer, but as a government we have made a very responsible decision to put the public health of the people of Bogota as the first consideration," said Hector Zambrano, Bogota health secretary.</p>
<p>The developments came as Chivas defender Hector Reynoso apologized for coughing and making other gestures in an opponent's face like he was trying to spread the swine flu.</p>
<p>Tennis</p>
<p>Big guns shoot way</p>
<p>into Rome semifinals</p>
<p>Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic posted straight-set wins yesterday to set up a semifinal meeting in the Rome Masters, and three-time champion Rafael Nadal advanced in the other half of the draw.</p>
<p>Nadal cruised past eighth-seeded Fernando Verdasco 6-3, 6-3, improving to 8-0 against his fellow Spaniard. He will play 12th-seeded Fernando Gonzalez, who struggled past Argentine qualifier Juan Monaco 2-6, 6-3, 6-4.</p>
<p>Federer overcame net-charging German qualifier Mischa Zverev, advancing 7-6 (3), 6-2. Djokovic stayed on course to defend his title in this clay-court warmup for the French Open with a 6-3, 6-4 victory over fifth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro.</p>
<p>Football</p>
<p>Vikes prospect Harvin</p>
<p>admitted to hospital</p>
<p>Minnesota Vikings first-round draft pick Percy Harvin has been hospitalized due to severe dehydration.</p>
<p>According to coach Brad Childress, the wide receiver was feeling ill Thursday and vomited on a flight from Florida to Atlanta.</p>
<p>Swine flu was ruled out, but high alert for the virus had paramedics hustling to treat him once the plane landed.</p>

<p>Tragically, through the swine flu Mexican migrant farm workers have become visible as a health risk and many Canadians are opposed to their return. The majority of migrant workers undergo intensive medical examinations each year to determine their capability to continue working in Canadian fields, greenhouses and packaging plants.</p>
<p>Through my community and academic work over the years I have seen how migrant workers' health, safety and human rights are constantly violated by their work in Canada, with many being deported once they are injured at work. Some also lose their lives here while their families back in Mexico are left without any type of compensation. But for these injustices there is only silence and indifference on the part of the Canadian public.</p>
<p>Safety precautions should be taken with everyone entering Canada from Mexico until more is known about this flu. Mexicans, and Guatemalan migrant workers for that matter, should not be differentially treated by Canadian authorities. We will be working closely with Mexican migrant farm workers to monitor the backlash they may feel in their host communities across rural Ontario and when entering the country.</p>
<p>I urge the public to be clear-headed and remember the lessons from SARS when all of Chinatown became a racialized quarantine zone along with East Asian peoples. Can we do better than that and instead stand in support with our neighbours to the south? Let us not forget how interdependent we are as a continent.</p>

</p>
<p>On Thursday, the World Health Organization quietly announced that it was dropping the term swine flu. The new virus that still threatens a global pandemic, it said, would now be referred to as influenza A(H1N1).</p>
<p>The United Nations agency's decision was a victory for the beleaguered pork industry, which has seen its sales collapse since consumers began to associate pigs with disease. It was also a reminder that, in the real world, public health is never about health alone.</p>
<p>Indeed, thanks in large part to the powerful animal industry, the political economy of swine flu is even more complex than its virology.</p>
<p>While it may seem common sense that virulent epidemics should be handled on a purely medical basis, that's rarely the case.</p>
<p>In 1918, the final year of World War I, Allied governments downplayed the first North American outbreak of so-called Spanish flu for reasons of national security. That pandemic ended up killing 50 million worldwide. But the pattern of locating specific health concerns within a broader political context continued.</p>
<p>That's why so much of the global response to the current outbreak appears so contradictory. The Canadian government has advised against all unnecessary travel to Mexico, the epidemic's point of origin. Yet at the same time, Ottawa won't limit temporary Mexican farm workers entering Canada, insisting only on the most precursory of checks before they board their flights.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the WHO has refused to issue any kind of travel warning against Mexico, arguing that in this case it would do no good. And yet Mexico itself has imposed a kind of internal system of travel restrictions by requiring businesses and public establishments in the capital to temporarily close.</p>
<p>How to make sense of this? To most people, the Mexican government's response would probably seem more rational than that of the WHO. Even though the virus has spread globally, the probability of catching swine flu is almost certainly higher in a crowded Mexico City bar than in, say, Winnipeg.</p>
<p>But thanks in large part to Canada's vigorous attacks on the WHO for its decision to slap a travel advisory against Toronto during the 2003 SARS crisis, that very political UN agency has learned its lesson: Such warnings cause too much trouble.</p>
<p>In fact, the current WHO director-general, Canadian-educated Margaret Chan, was elected to the post in 2006 (with the open support of Beijing), after defeating the man largely responsible for issuing SARS travel advisories against Toronto, Hong Kong and China's Guangdong province.</p>
<p>Similarly, while Ottawa meets little political opposition at home when it advises against tourist travel to Mexico, it would face the wrath of Canadian farmers if it attempted to limit their supply of cheap seasonal labour. But nowhere are economic, political and public-health concerns more entangled than in the powerful animal industry itself.</p>
<p>It is no surprise that this particular virus originated in pigs. Since the 1930s, scientists have known that certain kinds of influenza strains may migrate between pigs and humans. In some cases, the strains hop back and forth, mutating at each stage and becoming more powerful with each new variant.</p>
<p>Such strains become even more deadly when avian flu is mixed in. Livestock operations, large or small, that keep birds, pigs and humans in close proximity are asking for trouble.</p>
<p>As Peter Thorne, director of environmental health research at the University of Iowa, points out, this is one reason why some flu pandemics originated in southern China, where peasant farmers not only lived close to their chickens and pigs but transported them, all together, live to market.</p>
<p>Yet while all forms of swine husbandry carry the risk of flu, evidence is building that large-scale industrial farming is even more susceptible. A major U.S. study last year, carried out by the Pew Charitable Trust and Johns Hopkins University, concluded that factory farming presents an "unacceptable level of risk to public health."</p>
<p>In particular, the study pointed to the practice of confining pigs in large barns where viruses can pass back and forth between animals, from them to swine workers and finally to the community at large.</p>
<p>"While transmission of new or novel viruses from animals to humans, such as avian or swine influenza, seems a rather infrequent event today," the report says, "the continual cycling of viruses and other pathogens in large herds or flocks increases opportunities...through mutation or recombination events that could result in more efficient human-to-human transmission."</p>
<p>In a 2007 paper written for the journal Environmental Health Perspectives, the University of Iowa's Thorne and five other experts came to similar conclusions. Large-scale factory farms facilitate the rapid transmission and mixing of swine flu viruses such as H1N1. If industrial hog farms are too close to avian operations (such as chicken farms) the danger of a serious flu pandemic increases yet again.</p>
<p>Which is one theory of what happened in Mexico. While it is by no means certain the epidemic began, as many Mexicans suspect, in a giant Veracruz factory farm, it is clear the virus did originate in swine somewhere and recombined later with bird flu to create a strain that could infect and kill humans.</p>
<p>For the pork industry, these are most unwelcome findings. Industrial farming is on the rise everywhere, including Ontario, as farm operators - faced with cheap competition from abroad - try to take advantage of economies of scale. The Veracruz operation, owned by U.S. pork giant Smithfield Farms, involves 950,000 hogs.</p>
<p>And with factory farming comes disease. Pigs confined in such places, usually in pens above open tanks of manure and urine, suffer stress and so-called wasting that leaves them more susceptible to disease. Weaned quickly after birth, most lack the natural defences against disease that mother's milk provides.</p>
<p>Cate Dewey, a swine-health expert at the University of Guelph, says a recent survey found that about half of Ontario's pig farms tested positive for swine flu. Roughly 80 per cent of sows and 20 per cent of so-called finishing pigs - those that are ready to be slaughtered - were infected, she says - although not necessarily with variants that can be passed from human to human.</p>
<p>And, yes, regardless of what the animal industry suggests, it seems that swine flu can be passed on in raw or undercooked pork. The 2007 paper by Thorne and his colleagues noted that influenza "can be transmitted via water, air, consumption or handling of meat products."</p>
<p>Another study, this one published in the U.S. journal Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2006, found that workers in meat-processing plants have a greater likelihood of being infected by some version of the H1N1 flu virus than the general population (the odds of pig farmers getting the disease are significantly greater again).</p>
<p>The University of Guelph's Dewey says if slaughterhouses follow the rules, flu-infected pigs should be diverted from the human to the pet-food chain.</p>
<p>She also makes the important point, that since heat kills viruses, pork that is sufficiently cooked will be flu-free.</p>
<p>These are all fairly subtle distinctions. Don't expect them to dominate the official discourse. The game here is to convince the public that, yes, this near-pandemic is important, but no - other than washing our hands - we don't have to do anything differently.</p>

<p>MEME, n: an idea, behaviour, style or usage that spreads from person</p>
<p>to person within a culture</p>
<p>"Do not take actions," Iowa's Luther College advised students in a swine flu bulletin, on account of "news media hype." Republican Texas Governor Rick Perry said "a substantial amount of media hype" should be ignored. "I refuse to get caught up in the media hype at this point," wrote the editor of Truck News, a website about the Canadian transportation agency. "Media hype is out of hand," wrote a Huffington Post blogger. The meme spread so quickly it spawned a new trend: anti-media-hype stories by the ever-pliable media. Britain's Dr. Ben Goldacre, who believes swine flu is a serious threat, was forced to turn down interview requests from both Al Jazeera and the BBC. They wanted him to argue the threat had been...overhyped. "The media themselves," he wrote, "have lost all confidence in their own ability to give us the facts."</p>

</div><div>Linda Diebel   </div>

</p>
<p>ACAPULCO, Mexico -- Despite warnings they aren't wanted from a city with swine flu, nothing stopped Mexico City residents from seizing their God-given right to party on the beach here - as they do every May long weekend.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Capitalinos woke up to the rude news Acapulco tourist officials feared they would import swine flu from their virtually locked-down city.</p>
<p>"Don't come," said Covadonga Gomez, Acapulco's hotel and tourist association chief. "There are no discos, bars or restaurants open because, contrary to normal, we invite people (from the capital) to stay at home this weekend."</p>
<p>Reports on the news said people were stoning cars with Mexico City plates in Acapulco, and police had turned back vehicles on the Highway of the Sun to Acapulco.</p>
<p>Well, not quite. This is, after all, vibrant and freethinking Mexico.</p>
<p>So, while the rest of the country remains walloped by mass cancellations of foreign tourists - and a mass exodus - Acapulco retains its tradition as the May long weekend fun capital - at least for some Mexicans.</p>
<p>"There is nothing in Mexico City except to stay in my house," said Jose Luis Velasquez Cortes, 54, an engineer from the capital, as he strolled down the main street here, Costera Miguel Aleman.</p>
<p>"A hotel in a good climate is much better, no?"</p>
<p>Besides, he expressed a view shared by many Mexicans who don't trust what the government says about swine flu.</p>
<p>The week has been a see-saw of changing numbers that reached an official count yesterday of 16 deaths from H1N1 influenza A (as it's now called by the World Health Organization) and 397 confirmed cases of illness.</p>
<p>"I don't know if the news is true or not. I don't think the government tells us the truth," said Velasquez. "There's swine flu in the capital and not here. Moreover, there's no pollution like there is in Mexico City. It's great."</p>
<p>There's no question tourism is markedly down here. Still, it's hardly deserted or dead.</p>
<p>The holiday runs from yesterday's International Workers Day to Cinco de Mayo celebrations Tuesday to mark a Mexican army victory over the French.</p>
<p>Wealthy capital city residents, who own holiday villas on the cliffs overlooking Acapulco Bay and in the development Costa Diamante, roared out from Mexico City in their Suburbans and Porsches.</p>
<p>Last night, discos like Senor Frog's were open, along with the beachfront restaurants that make this Pacific Coast vacation spot so popular. Mexican tourists dined at Sibu, La Gamba, and other hot spots.</p>
<p>There were no signs of stoning cars or hostility to Mexico City residents checking in at hotels.</p>
<p>Traffic on the main drag is lighter than in other years and lineups shorter. However, many beachfront hotels have healthy bookings until Tuesday in contrast to a worried capital, where a major hotel like the Camino Real Hotel Polanco has just 70 of its 700 rooms booked. Tourist officials say occupancy rates in the capital vary from 10 to 20 per cent.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the country, the news is grim. In Cabo San Lucas, the posh resort at the tip of Baja, California, cancellations are coming in at the rate of about 600 a day.</p>
<p>Yesterday, exit routes from Mexico City were jammed with cars, only a few drivers wearing masks. The odd rifle-toting police officer checked cars at toll booths where, occasionally, a money-taker wore a mask.</p>
<p>Unlike Mexico City, where people wear surgical masks, they are virtually non-existent in the still-swinging streets of Acapulco.</p>
<p>On the beach, a group of local youths laughed at the warnings from health officials to take precautions to avoid swine flu infection.</p>
<p>"Aw, it's all lies from the government," said a young beer-swilling man. "You know how to avoid getting sick: drink beer."</p>

<p>Andrea Page will not be sending her 10-year-old son to a classmates' house to work on a school project tomorrow.</p>
<p>She is worried her son could catch swine flu from one of the other boys who was due to return home today from a family holiday in Mexico.</p>
<p>"It's just a school project," she says. "It's just not worth the risk. I've got a 3-year-old at home. I'm not bringing flu home that might be a danger to a young child."</p>
<p>Page knows some might call her alarmist. But the Toronto mother of three and CEO of fitness company FitMom stands by the old adage of better safe than sorry. "It's my job to protect my children."</p>
<p>Page is one of thousands in the GTA who are wondering what to do in the face of a pending swine flu pandemic. As the number of cases rises across the country - there are now 12 confirmed in the GTA - people are walking a fine line between prepared and paranoid.</p>
<p>Much of the concern comes from the terminology, says Dr. Colin Lee, associate medical officer of health for Simcoe-Muskoka District Health Unit. Especially the word pandemic.</p>
<p>"Currently, we are not experiencing an influenza pandemic," said Lee, co-author of Pandemic Flu and You: a Canadian Guide. "Unfortunately the word is out there."</p>
<p>The reality, Lee said, is that people who lived through the last two influenza pandemics, in 1957 and 1968, "don't even remember experiencing it."</p>
<p>Still, there are signs of fear in the GTA. Surgical masks are being worn in grocery stores and by couples strolling downtown streets. Subway riders are cringing when a fellow passenger coughs without covering his mouth. Pharmacies have sold out of masks, including the specialized N95 respirator masks. Hand sanitizer has flown off shelves.</p>
<p>"I bought the last bottle," says Leila Monib, who popped into the Shoppers Drug Mart in Dundas Square yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Gihan Massoud, owner of Leaside Community Pharmacy, tried to order extra masks and hand sanitizer the morning after swine flu made front-page headlines.</p>
<p>"That was on Monday. But I'm not able to get any at all."</p>
<p>Telehealth Ontario, the free 24/7 phone line that connects residents with registered nurses, fielded 22,000 calls from April 25 to April 30. Last April, it received 64,500 calls for the entire month.</p>
<p>Sophie Mervin, a consultant for a public relations firm, said her fear escalated after her company began sending out multiple cautionary emails on the new virus every day and placed bottles of hand sanitizer on every employee's desk.</p>
<p>Dr. Barbara Yaffe, director of communicable disease control at Toronto Public Health, says while there has been some public anxiety, people have mostly "acted quite reasonably."</p>
<p>"They are not panicking, they are listening to our messages," she says, noting the Toronto Public Health website got more than 10,000 hits last week.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- There is plenty of mystery surrounding the new strain of influenza that has sickened at least 51 Canadians, but the top doctor charged with both warning and reassuring the public is cautiously optimistic about the coming days.</p>
<p>"This is the first time in human history where we are actually watching the development of a potential pandemic," Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones mused during his daily news conference, where federal officials rolled out the details of a public awareness campaign that will blitz the media with advice about handwashing and staying home when sick. "That has never happened before, nor have we ever had the kind of science capacity, hospital and treatment capacity, etc., than we do now."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones stressed everyone must be prepared for things to get worse: the flu could practically disappear over the summer only to return with a vengeance in the fall as the devastating Spanish flu did in 1918. The virus itself, now called H1N1 influenza A after its original name, "swine flu," caused a backlash against pork, is constantly changing. More cases will pop up as provinces do more testing.</p>
<p>But for now he looks out on the immediate horizon and sees something good.</p>
<p>"What gives me short-term optimism is we are at the end of what would be normally flu season, so the chances are that this will die down over the summer ... and we will be in a position to develop a vaccine over the summer, put more planning into place ... so whatever we face in the fall, whether it is mild or severe, we are in a better position to deal with it," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Canada is talking with pharmaceutical giant GlaxoSmithKline Inc. about manufacturing the vaccine when the time comes.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases in Canada climbed to 51 yesterday after New Brunswick reported its first case and Alberta, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Ontario reported 16 new cases. All are mild.</p>
<p>"These numbers are not unexpected," Dr. David Williams, acting chief medical officer of health for Ontario, said yesterday, adding more cases are expected soon.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hope among the ruins of Burma; A year after cyclone tore villages apart, generals allow more aid to flow but still silence critics</b>
</div><div>Olivia Ward   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>960 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Nway was in her uncle's bamboo hut in Burma's Irrawaddy Delta when the cyclone struck. As it gained terrifying force, they fled to the village chief's sturdier home and huddled there as the screaming winds passed over.</p>
<p>When it was all over, the 8-year-old's parents and three siblings were dead, bodies of friends and neighbours floated in the salty, flooding waters and the village's farming and fishing economy was drowned - along with its hopes for the future.</p>
<p>On this weekend's one-year anniversary of Cyclone Nargis - one of the deadliest storms in world history - the little girl and her surviving relatives are fighting back against poverty, hunger, trauma and the fear that comes with the onset of the yearly monsoon that can take as well as give life to the community.</p>
<p>"The ghosts of the storm still linger," says Canadian Pamela Sitko, who made a recent trip to Burma (also known as Myanmar) as a relief communications officer for World Vision. "It's been a terrifying experience, and it's in the back of everyone's mind when the wind howls."</p>
<p>The massive destruction wreaked by Nargis also lingers.</p>
<p>Although villages in the low-lying Pyapon region where Nway lives are showing new signs of life through the resilience of the residents and the efforts of international aid groups, the devastation has not disappeared.</p>
<p>More than 1 million Burmese are still living in tumbledown shacks, over 2.4 million are struggling to rebuild their lives, 138,000 are dead or missing, and at least one-third of a $477 million UN appeal is unfunded. A global appeal for a longer term recovery plan has had disappointing response.</p>
<p>"The biggest concern is continued international assistance," says Edmonton-born Sitko, who is based in Bangkok.</p>
<p>"Survivors still need tractors, boats, fertilizer, livestock. Women, who weren't the primary breadwinners, need to build up their skills to earn an income. But with the global financial crisis, and now swine flu, how do we keep up the momentum?"</p>
<p>It's a life-or-death issue for those marking the bitter anniversary in Burma, ruled by an iron-fisted military junta whose paranoia made it difficult for aid to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate people in the crucial early days of the disaster.</p>
<p>Now, aid groups say, access has improved. Humanitarian shipments from all over the world are accepted, and the number of international aid groups has doubled over the past year.</p>
<p>They even see glimmers of hope that the training and counselling local people have received to upgrade teaching, medical, and other social service skills are making small inroads into the monolithic government control that has held Burma in its grip for more than four decades.</p>
<p>But, warns Khin Maung Win, of the Democratic Voice of Burma, "it would be premature to speak of real change," and he says that could happen only if international aid can go directly to community groups, building self-sufficiency, an effort opposed by the government, which fears ceding any form of power.</p>
<p>Since the cyclone, he points out, repression has deepened for ordinary people, including those who came from other parts of the country to help cyclone victims.</p>
<p>The most famous, the comedian Zarganar, was sentenced to 59 years for the "crime" of distributing aid to his countrymen - a life sentence for the 48-year-old. He and others have been transferred to remote prisons where their families are forbidden to see them.</p>
<p>"Zarganar is now near the China border," said Win. "When his family finally arrived there, a few weeks ago, they were refused a visit. And that's not a unique case. It's a form of moral torture."</p>
<p>Human Rights Watch says the political crackdown has worsened since Cyclone Nargis, and hundreds have been slapped with long jail terms. The fate of thousands of monks who were targeted by the government after leading demonstrations in 2007 is unknown.</p>
<p>"Many of them were from outside Rangoon, and we think the government forced them to go back to where they came from," said Win, a Burmese exile based in Norway. "They went missing on the way. No more than 100 escaped to Thailand. But hundreds of thousands are still there, and we don't know what has happened to them."</p>
<p>Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi, whose house was damaged by the cyclone, is still under house arrest, although her lawyer is appealing an extension of her sentence. Government critics say she will likely be kept under guard until after an election which may be held next year.</p>
<p>In the destitute Irrawaddy Delta, politics is far from the cyclone survivors' minds.</p>
<p>The monsoon that should irrigate this year's crops is due, and Burma, known as Asia's rice-bowl, depends on it. But many are living in perilous conditions, receiving aid for daily necessities, and praying that the rains will not lash away their fragile recovery.</p>
<p>Still, the killer epidemics predicted a year ago have not materialized. Schools have opened and household repairs have been made. Signs, Sitko says, of progress.</p>
<p>"When World Vision (workers) met Nway after the cyclone, she wouldn't talk and she just clung to her aunt. This time she was putting powder on her face for our visit and singing out that a tray of fruit was on the way. A year later, she has really changed."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario resorts brace for rocky summer; Worst season in 20 years forecast as new passport rules, recession and swine flu deter U.S. tourists</b>
</div><div>Lisa Wright   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1398 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>B01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Peter Elmhirst remembers a simpler time when the charming cottages at his family-run resort in the Kawarthas were teeming with U.S. tourists eager to take leisurely fishing trips off the north shore of Rice Lake.</p>
<p>But like most Ontario resort owners, he doesn't see many licence plates from Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio anymore at his tranquil vacation spot in Keene, southeast of Peterborough.</p>
<p>So lately his family has been fishing for tourists both locally and abroad with offbeat package deals he hopes will attract business in the midst of a crippling recession the industry fears will put a sizeable dent in summer travel.</p>
<p>"We're expecting quite a decline this year. Beyond May-June, it's tough to say" how many people will show, he says.</p>
<p>Industry veterans expect the so-called 'staycation' trend to be in full force this year as more people opt to stay home and save money rather than venture out, and local travel and tourism businesses are bracing for a slow summer as a result.</p>
<p>"It's pretty challenging times for us with a lot of people staying close to home and taking these 'staycations'," says Randy Williams, president and CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of Canada.</p>
<p>He is expecting the worst season in more than 20 years, projecting a 5 per cent drop on the $75 billion spent annually on tourism across the country. The last time there was a year-over-year loss was during the SARS health crisis in 2003, and even that was less of a hit in the minus 2 per cent range.</p>
<p>Last year the strong Canadian dollar and soaring fuel prices were the culprits keeping folks at home. Before that it was SARS and the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks. Now another set of issues is conspiring to hammer Canadian tourism, from the battered economy to the swine flu scare that has put a damper on international travel generally.</p>
<p>Add to that an American law known as the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative, which as of June 1 will require United States citizens crossing the border by land or sea to carry a passport. (They are already required to have one to fly here.)</p>
<p>It's a big worry in the tourism sector since it's estimated that only about one-quarter of Americans currently have a passport. Four out of five visitors to Canada come from the U.S.</p>
<p>"The economy is just the latest nail in the coffin. Come June, they (Americans driving into Canada) are going to need a passport, which impacts all of us," Elmhirst notes.</p>
<p>So far this year, overnight trips to Canada from the U.S. were down 5.3 per cent last January and February over the same period last year, the latest figures from Statistics Canada show. Overnight trips last February fell 7 per cent compared with the same month in 2008.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the leisure travel plans of both Americans as well as Canadians - who make up 80 per cent of Canada's tourism industry through domestic travel - have dipped too.</p>
<p>In the latest survey of travel intentions by the Conference Board of Canada, 59.2 per cent of Canadians polled last February said they intend to take a summer holiday, down from 62.4 per cent in March, 2008. Trip intentions were down for holidays to both domestic and U.S. destinations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the vacation intentions of Americans remain historically low, according to the latest consumer confidence report by <span class="companylink">The Conference Board Inc</span>. in New York. Last February, 36.6 per cent of Americans polled planned to take a vacation within the next six months, down from 37.5 per cent of those polled last December.</p>
<p>"This summer is going to be slow," says Andrew Clark, vice-president of market development for the Canadian Tourism Commission, which promotes Canada as a travel destination worldwide.</p>
<p>"We're heavily reliant on the U.S., but Americans travel closer to home in times of stress," he notes.</p>
<p>Though Elmhirst's Resort in the Kawarthas was originally geared toward U.S. customers and simple fishing vacations - up to the 1980s, almost all of their visitors were from the U.S. - times have completely changed. He says only around 10 per cent of his guests come from south of the border now, 25 per cent are European and the majority are domestic customers, particularly in late fall, winter and spring.</p>
<p>Because things are growing more competitive lately in terms of rates and deals, Elmhirst is offering some fairly novel package specials that go beyond plain old fishing, from motorcycle jamborees to kiteboarding weekends and sustainability dinners (where all the food is grown and raised within a kilometre) to try to lure in that ever-fickle tourist dollar.</p>
<p>"To keep the doors open these days, you have to get creative," says Elmhirst.</p>
<p>His historic, 100-hectare resort - complete with grazing Black Angus beef cattle and a runway for bush planes - has been in operation since his grandparents opened it in the 1920s. Keeping it all in the family, his son Greg now runs it.</p>
<p>"It's a challenge and it worries you. But the worst thing you can do is sit back and wait for things to get better," he adds.</p>
<p>Over in Huntsville, the Deerhurst Resort is offering discounts on early bookings and cutting room rates for longer stays after a slow March break and a 10 per cent drop in summer bookings so far.</p>
<p>"Staying at home, staying in your backyard, is evident," says Deerhurst's general manager Joseph Klein. "There's an absolute, last-minute consumer out there. It's a buyer's market and the competition is getting very aggressive, creative and innovative."</p>
<p>About 90 per cent of Deerhurst's visitors are from the Greater Toronto Area, whether it's for leisure travel or corporate bookings year-round. Only 5 per cent to 7 per cent of the traffic is from the U.S.</p>
<p>He's also noticed that since late last year, the volume of corporate business has dropped off.</p>
<p>"Group business is more frugal. Organizations are watching their budgets and tending not to commit to future dates, or they're delaying or deferring dates" for annual, off-site company conferences, Klein says.</p>
<p>Convention business in Toronto is still holding steady, mainly because conferences are typically booked well in advance. But the trend now is toward fewer people attending and less money spent on the high-end food and beverage side, says John Houghton, executive vice-president of the Metro Toronto Convention Centre.</p>
<p>"The big corporate conventions, they have really slowed down. Corporate events have larger budgets and spend more per person than the associations (that put on conventions). But it's been dramatically downsized," he explains.</p>
<p>"It's going to be an average year, not a stellar year. Company travel budgets are getting cut back in this economy."</p>
<p>Houghton is thrilled to have landed the American Society of Association Executives this summer - essentially the motherlode in terms of people who run the associations that hold annual conventions.</p>
<p>"This is like the convention of conventions. We'll have 6,000 people here in August and we get to show how spectacular a city Toronto is for holding conventions."</p>
<p>Josef Ebner, regional vice-president and managing director of the Delta Chelsea Hotel in Toronto, considers the summer of 2009 "a question mark" at this point.</p>
<p>"We've been struggling along so far this year. Everyone is booking late because people don't really know what's happening in the world. People don't know if they will lose their jobs," he says.</p>

<p>"The Number 1 weakest link in bringing in U.S. tourists is the delays and complications with the time it takes to cross the border. Now they'll need a passport. So it's going to be an interesting summer."</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian stocks headed into the weekend on a positive note, thanks to rising oil and metals prices, but Friday's gains weren't quite enough to keep Canada's main exchange from recording its first weekly loss in nearly two months.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index jumped 172.13 points or 1.85% to 9496.96 yesterday as gainers outpaced losers by more than three-to-one and nine of 10 industry groups ended in the black.</p>
<p>Yesterday's gains helped pare losses suffered during the week that stemmed from the global outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>But the benchmark still finished down 0.55% from the previous Friday's close of 9549.48. The TSX venture exchange was also higher yesterday, jumping 1.19 points, or 0.1%, to 1010.17, and the Canadian dollar closed at US$0.8432, up 50 basis points.</p>
<p>In the United States, all three major indices overcame early losses and closed the week more than 1% higher. Yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average added 44.29 points or 0.54% to 8212.41. The S&P 500 advanced 4.71 points or 0.54% to 877.52 and the Nasdaq composite index jumped 1.90 points or 0.11% to 1719.20.</p>
<p>"It is truly impressive how investors managed to shake off the initial jitters over swine flu at the start of the week, pushing most major markets higher yet again on the week on growing signs that the worst is over for the global downturn and the fact that Mexico is reporting fewer new cases of the flu," said Doug Porter, deputy chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p>Commodity prices got a boost yesterday from a new survey that showed in April U.S. consumers felt more confident about the U.S. economy and from new data showing a slowing contraction in the U.S. manufacturing sector. In Toronto, energy stocks were 3.74% higher as oil rose US$2.08 to US$53.20 and <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. was upgraded to Goldman Sach Group Inc.'s "conviction buy" buy list. Suncor was up nearly 8% to $32.37.</p>
<p>The materials group was also higher as base metals such as copper rose on the renewed economic sentiment. Gold, meanwhile, fell US$3 to US$888.20.</p>
<p>Other stocks making noise yesterday included <span class="companylink">Research in Motion Ltd</span>., and <span class="companylink">Cott Corp</span>. The BlackBerry maker climbed more than 4% after <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst Jeffrey Fan upgraded his rating on the company from "neutral" to "buy" and increased his price target from US$85 to US$90. Cott climbed more than 70% yesterday after the generic soft drink maker beat estimates, reporting first-quarter profit of $0.28 a share, compared with its year-earlier loss of $0.30 a share.</p>

<p>Two women from Prairie Village, Kan., are accused of running a prostitution ring that attracted some of its clients from a nearby golf course. Police say Karen Rutherford, 32, and Michelle Segall, 27, allegedly met men on the greens of the course, danced for them in the clubhouse, or used golf events to meet customers. That brash approach constitutes Fore!-play ... It could be said that johns who went right from the golf course to the location of the prostitution ring were visiting the 19th 'ho' ... American swimming star Michael Phelps has revamped his freestyle stroke and plans to unveil it May 14. Noted Scott Ostler of the San Francisco Chronicle: "I predict he'll come out smoking."</p>
<p>Under Armour has recalled more than 210,000 athletic cups because they may break if they're hit. According to the recall notice, Under Armour has received five reports of cups breaking, "including an injury involving cuts and bruising." Now that is a groin injury ... If medical attention was needed after that particular incident, it brings new meaning to "doctoring the balls" ... Former major-leaguer (and admitted steroid-gobbler) Jose Canseco is to make his mixed martial arts debut May 26 against a 7-foot-2, 330-pounder named Hong Man Choi. Canseco likely misunderstood the offer and thought he was being offered a chance to make a comeback as a Giant.</p>
<p>In her soon-to-be-published book A-Rod, Sports Illustrated writer Selena Roberts suggests New York Yankees star Alex Rodriguez may have started using steroids in high school. That explains the A he got in chemistry ... The Yankees have been ridiculed this season for having priced some of their seats out of the reach of the common fan. One of those who spouted off was Major League Soccer commissioner Don Garber, who told a gathering of sports editors that it was "incomprehensible" that there would be empty front-row seats at Yankees games. Told of those comments, Yankees president Randy Levine replied: "Don Garber discussing Yankee attendance must be a joke. We draw more people in a year than his entire league does in a year ... Hey Don, worry about (David) Beckham, not the Yankees. Even he wants out of your league."</p>
<p>This week's wacky soccer story comes from Mexico, where all 176 professional matches on the schedule for this weekend will be played before empty stands. Fans have been told to stay home to avoid catching or spreading the swine flu that has swept the country, meaning all of Mexico's stadia this weekend will resemble Yankee Stadium ... The Torquay Tigers, an Aussie Rules football team, caused a stir when they displayed on their website a picture of some men in Ku Klux Klan garb to promote a club social called "All White Night." After the media caught wind of it, the Tigers took down the picture of the KKK and replaced it with an image of Snow White. Someone in the Tigers' front office truly was Dopey ... Montreal Canadiens legend Guy Lafleur faces a maximum of 14 years in prison after being convicted Friday of giving contradictory evidence at his son's bail hearing. Court heard Lafleur tried to cover up the truth -- with his toupee.</p>
<p>Before his bout against WBC super-middleweight champ Carl Froch, boxer Jermain Taylor told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette he was ready to go. "My last few fights have been all sweet, huggy, kissy," Taylor said. "I finally got somebody that I really don't like." Taylor likely hates Froch even more -- the Brit was behind on the judges' cards when he scored a TKO with 14 seconds left in the 12th and final round ... The last words this week go to a pair of cheerleaders, who may have been pulling everyone's legs in the profiles posted on their team's websites. Then again, maybe not. First there's Denver Nuggets cheerleader Krista Kay who, when asked what most people don't know about her, replied: "I speak fluent Canadian." Then there's Washington Capitals ice girl Sarah who, when asked to name her favorite book, wrote: "<span class="companylink">Facebook</span>."</p>

</p>
<p>With the World Health Organization saying that containing the outbreak of swine flu is no longer possible, global public health officials face a dilemma as they turn their attention to the production of a new vaccine against a potential pandemic.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu vaccine is normally ready for final approval in August, and distributed shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>The typical flu season lasts from November to April.</p>
<p>But with the new H1N1 flu spreading quickly, scientists at WHO and around the world, must decide whether work should begin on a new seasonal-flu vaccine now or whether they should wait and see if a pandemic really hits.</p>
<p>Beginning the process of producing a new vaccine now could interfere with the work now under way on seasonal flu, which kills tens of thousands worldwide.</p>
<p>Margaret Chan, the director general of the WHO, alerted manufacturers this week to the potential need for a pandemic vaccine, but she said there was no reason now to stop the production of seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Allan Ronald, scientific adviser to the International Centre for Infectious Diseases in Winnipeg, said scientists have been so focused on dealing with the outbreak, no one has had time to think through all the scenarios of how a new flu vaccine should be developed.</p>
<p>He noted that no flu epidemic in North America has lasted beyond May and it is likely this current outbreak will wane and then return during the next flu season.</p>
<p>That will give scientists time to develop a new vaccine.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Survivor urges all to heed warnings</b>
</div><div>Robert Remington   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service; Calgary Herald</div>
<div>734 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Funeral homes hired extra drivers to collect corpses. Carpenters built caskets as fast as they could. In the town of High River, Alta., about 60 kilometres south of Calgary, an auto-repair shop was turned into a mortuary. In Edmonton, 54 bodies awaiting burial were stored in a livery stable.</p>
<p>For eight-year-old Marion Taylor, it was a confusing and frightening time.</p>
<p>"I remember every detail. My brother was in a coma for 10 days. He had to be force-fed with his eyes closed," said Taylor, 99. "When I got sick, I laid in the bed with my head hanging over, dripping blood from my nose. My father came home and said, 'A whole family went today.'</p>
<p>"I wondered, 'Went where?' What did that mean? I was a kid. I found out later."</p>
<p>Taylor is a survivor of the 1918 influenza epidemic that killed between 30,000 and 50,000 Canadians, a toll that makes the current swine flu outbreak seem insignificant.</p>
<p>Still, Taylor warns people to heed all the precautions of health officials. She said she fears the events of 1918, seared into her memory, could happen again.</p>
<p>"People are so careless today," said the retired nurse, interviewed in her Calgary home.</p>
<p>"Most people today say. 'Oh, I'm not going to get it.' People my age who remember it are mostly all gone. The people who came after us don't realize what can happen."</p>
<p>Taylor was living in the small Saskatchewan town of Wolseley, 100 kilometres east of Regina, when the flu hit. She recalls her classmates dying.</p>
<p>"That was very hard for children. What do you tell them?"</p>
<p>The 1918-20 pandemic is "generally regarded as the most deadly disease event in human history," according to the World Health Organization. In its first year, the flu killed more than 40 million people -- five times the number of military deaths during the five years of the First World War.</p>
<p>Estimates of the pandemic's two-year global death toll vary widely from 50 to 100 million deaths, or between 2.5 and five per cent of the world's population, according to WHO. Nearly 30 per cent of the world's population fell ill.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu killed 85 per cent of the people of the Beaver Indian reserve in Alberta between November 1918 and April 1919.</p>
<p>Survivors were too weak to put the bodies on cabin roofs to keep stray dogs from devouring them. In the area of Lac La Biche, Alta., 520 kilometres northeast of Calgary, a volunteer entered one cabin to find seven people dead on the floor and one man barely alive.</p>
<p>A second pandemic that began in 1957, which left two million dead, was caused by a milder virus than the one responsible for the 1918-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Globally, the current outbreak of H1N1 as of Friday had spread to 12 countries with confirmed cases approaching 350, including more than 50 in Canada.</p>
<p>The relatively low figures are not being taken lightly by health officials, who are working on a vaccine -- said to be six months away -- in hopes of preventing a repeat of the pandemics of 1918-20, 1957-58 and 1968-69.</p>
<p>According to mathematical modelling done in 2006 by the Public Health Agency of Canada as part of its Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan, a new strain such as H1N1 could kill 10,000 to 58,000 Canadians in a period of about six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>The pandemic could also result in the hospitalization of 34,000 to 138,000 people and leave 4.5 million to 10.6 million others too sick to work, devastating the economy.</p>
<p>The agency notes on its website that its figures "should not be interpreted as predictions for the next pandemic, but instead a reflection of current opinion regarding a reasonable scenario to guide planning activities."</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of the flu in 1918, Alberta's provincial board of health ordered every person to wear a gauze masks outside of their home. Taylor remembers people wearing moistened masks with eucalyptus, which was thought to help prevent the spread of the flu.</p>
<p>"The whole country smelled of eucalyptus. I'm not sure if it did much good. It was horrible," she said.</p>
<p>"Whole families went. That was quite common. Terrible."</p>

<p>Cancelled school trips, passengers in Heathrow en route to Canada in face masks, Catholic priests in Edmonton recommending worshippers stop shaking hands in peace and just nod their heads instead.</p>
<p>As human swine flu reached 11 countries Friday, critics feared "swine flu hysteria" may spread faster than the virus itself.</p>
<p>We're going down a road with no road map, some say, with nothing to tell people how scared they should be. Given the lack of hard evidence, blind panic and total calm can both make sense.</p>
<p>Among the big unknowns: Will swine flu stay in the human population to become another seasonal flu strain? Will it die out entirely? Is the virus genetically stable as it moves from human to human? Or is it evolving, changing its properties to become more lethal?</p>
<p>We might be better off consulting the phases of the moon for insights, says University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown.</p>
<p>But "the current trend both inside and outside of Mexico is reassuring," says Brown. "We aren't seeing explosive spread with cases of pneumonia."</p>
<p>New Brunswick confirmed its first case of swine flu Friday which, along with new cases in B.C., Alberta and Nova Scotia, raised Canada's total to 51 since the first cases in Canada were reported on April 26.</p>
<p>By contrast, 1,092 Canadians tested positive for seasonal influenza during just a single, one-week period, from March 1 to 7.</p>
<p>Nearly half (47 per cent) of Canadians are concerned they, or someone in their family, might contract swine flu, according to an Ipsos Reid poll for Canwest News Service and Global National. Fifteen per cent of 1,001 adults surveyed from April 29 to 30 said they were "very much" concerned.</p>
<p>On Friday, a <span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> flight from Germany to Washington was diverted to Boston because a female passenger complained of flu symptoms. Egypt has ordered a nationwide pig slaughter. U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden said Thursday he wouldn't travel anywhere in a confined space because of swine flu.</p>
<p>"All the talk of pandemics just gets people worked up, when what we're looking at here is a public health problem," says Philip Alcabes, author of Dread: How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics from the Black Death to the Avian Flu. People are getting sick, Alcabes says. "But it's not a crisis,"</p>
<p>Horror fantasies about the flu are always about the possibility of a repeat of 1918 Spanish flu, he says. Images of horse-drawn carriages carrying corpses and of people dropping dead in the street have become somehow iconic in our thinking about flu, he says. "And I think that's a shame. Because there's a lot of influenza, it's a public health problem every year in North America."</p>
<p>It makes a lot of people sick, and it kills a lot of people, he says. "But only once in history has there been a terrible (flu) disaster, and that was 1918."</p>
<p>But the world was a different place. "We didn't have the science we have now," says Alcabes, of Hunter College of the City University of New York. "We didn't have the public apparatus we have now."</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its alert level on Wednesday to phase five on a six-phase scale. "Six is what, the bubonic plague?" says Tim Blackmore, a professor in media studies at the University of Western Ontario.</p>

<p>As the number of cases of human swine flu in Canada climbed to 51, Canada's chief public health officer expressed optimism that the outbreak might turn out to be relatively mild.</p>
<p>And a new poll suggests Canadians, for the most part, are staying calm.</p>
<p>The Ipsos Reid poll, conducted exclusively for Canwest News Service and Global National, says fewer than half of those surveyed, 47 per cent, said they are "somewhat" or "very much" concerned that they or someone in their family might contract swine flu over the coming weeks or months.</p>
<p>Eight in ten -- 81 per cent -- have confidence federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq is taking the right steps to deal with swine flu's spread, and most supported the actions of their local hospitals and health officials.</p>
<p>"I think what this poll says is that no one's panicked out there," said John Wright, senior vice-president at Ipsos Reid Public Affairs. "I don't want to downplay this, but I think the reality is that a lot of Canadians are looking at this in a very pragmatic, sensible fashion."</p>
<p>The poll suggests Canadians have given a vote of confidence to public officials, he said.</p>
<p>"There's nobody who receives poor marks."</p>
<p>Canadian public health officials confirmed 17 new cases Friday: one in New Brunswick, the province's first; six in Nova Scotia; four in Ontario; two in Alberta and four in B.C. The new cases brought Canada's total to 51.</p>
<p>Like the others before it, the new cases are considered mild and the patients are expected to recover.</p>
<p>Despite the new cases, chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said there are several encouraging signs that suggest the outbreak might not be a catastrophic pandemic on the scale of the 1918 Spanish flu.</p>
<p>"We don't know exactly where it's going to go, but what gives me short-term optimism is that we're at the end of what would be normally flu season, so the chances are that this will die down over the summer," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>That would buy time to develop a vaccine and do more planning, "so that whatever we face in the fall, whether it's mild or severe, we're in a better position to deal with it."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization said Friday researchers had cleared the first step toward a swine-flu vaccine.</p>
<p>A senior WHO official said they are in negotiations with a "few dozen" manufacturers worldwide to arrange production of a vaccine, although she cautioned it could take four to six months for the first doses to be produced.</p>
<p>"Unless really there is very soon a signal that (the spread) might not continue, it seems mostly likely that the manufacturers will proceed," said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, WHO director of the Initiative for Vaccine Research.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said negotiations were also continuing between the Canadian government and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals</span>, the drug manufacturer that has agreed to supply Canada with a vaccine. "We're in a good position, once things are in place, to move forward," he said.</p>
<p>Kieny said researchers have identified the virus in their laboratories, the first stage toward vaccine production.</p>
<p>Although the number of confirmed cases continued to increase around the world, WHO gave no indication Friday it would raise its pandemic alert level.</p>
<p>The WHO alert level is at five on a scale of six, with six being considered a full-scale pandemic.</p>
<p>WHO has noted human-to-human transmission so far appeared to be confined to North America. To move to level six, WHO would have to observe human-to-human transmission in at least two global regions.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper adopted the new terminology for the swine flu Friday, calling it the "H1N1" virus while speaking to reporters in Sask-atchewan.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a medical condition, so it makes sense to refer to it that way. And I gather that is a standard the World Health Organization is now trying to encourage," said Harper, who spoke about the evolving flu situation after making an agricultural announcement northeast of Regina.</p>
<p>"This should not affect the pork industry," Harper added.</p>
<p>"One of the reasons we are encouraging people to move away from the term swine flu ... it's because the fact is that this does not in any way impact upon pork products."</p>
<p>The hog industry had called for a new name for the swine flu, noting it's passing from human to human and can't be caught by eating pork.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan had no confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu as of Friday, although the national case count rose above the 50 mark. Cases in Canada have been described as mild.</p>
<p>Harper said he thinks the public is concerned, but doesn't sense that there is "a panic."</p>
<p>"I sense the public is listening very carefully to various advisories and warnings they are getting and responding appropriately and that's what we encourage," the prime minister said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as school districts in some jurisdictions outside Saskatchewan curtail travel both in Canada and abroad due to flu fears, Regina Public Schools spokesman Terry Lazarou said such changes don't appear to be in the works for local schools.</p>
<p>Lazarou said the school division doesn't do out-of-province travel, but rather it's organized by school community council groups and parent groups. "I haven't heard of anything changing," he said.</p>
<p>However, reminders are being sent out on good cough etiquette and other hygiene practices, a message that is being relayed to students, he said.</p>
<p>"It's a good primer for us," he said, adding they will take advice from health officials if the flu situation changes.</p>
<p>A letter from the Ministry of Education is also being sent to parents, which reiterates steps that can be taken to control infection: hand-washing with soap and water or use of alcohol-based hand gel, cough and sneeze into the crook of your elbow and not your hands, and stay home when ill.</p>
<p>Regina Catholic Schools did not return calls Friday, but information on its website states daily operations continue as normal with an emphasis on infection control measures.</p>
<p>Local businesses, too, are keeping an eye on the situation -- but the flu seems to have sparked water cooler discussion more than it has significant changes to daily operations, said Saskatchewan Chamber of Commerce chief executive Steve McLellan.</p>
<p>McLellan said he hasn't heard of businesses curtailing international travel or taking other extra precautions due to the attention on the new flu virus.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Health issued a public service announcement Friday reminding people of good cough etiquette, and directing them to find more information about H1N1 influenza at www.health.gov.sk.ca[http://www.health.gov.sk.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca]. The HealthLine can also be contacted day or night at 1-877-800-0002.</p>

<p>They have added a few pounds and shed a few hairs, but that didn't prevent the original players from a 1993 high school football game that ended in a tie from replaying the game last weekend in Easton, Penn. The game between Phillipsburg High School and Easton Area High School, a Thanksgiving tradition since 1906, ended in a 7-7 tie 16 years ago. This time Phillipsburg won 27-12. In a related story, the Saskatchewan Roughriders have asked the CFL if they could replay the last 20 seconds of the 1976 Grey Cup . . . From Wilken: "Being from Saskatchewan, I can relate to Winnipeg Blue Bombers coach Mike Kelly calling my province the crotch of Canada, but looking at my map, I see Manitoba is right behind us.'' . . . I would be remiss in not wishing Toronto Maple Leafs fans a happy anniversary. It will be five years on Monday since the Buds participated in a playoff game. How time flies when you are watching mediocre hockey . . . Is it just me, or does Darren Dreger of TSN have more sources than the CIA? . . . Littlejohn, on Vikings quarterback Sage Rosenfels saying he will wear No. 2, in part, to honour his favourite band, U2: "Good thing he doesn't favour 10,000 Maniacs." . . . From Rolfsen: "It quickly became clear that the main feature of the Oakland Raiders draft war room was a dartboard.'' . . . Hough, on Thursday's marathon game between the Chicago Bulls and Boston Celtics: "I think that game lasted longer than the Detroit Pistons lasted in the playoffs.'' . . . Wilken, on the Alberta government taking heat over the increase in wait times to get into emergency wards: "A spokesperson says now that the Flames season is over, they expect to see a lot less traffic.''</p>
<p>What's the deal with so many Toronto Blue Jays games not being shown on Sportsnet West? It makes absolutely no sense to viewers in this part of the world to have a Blue Jays game on Sportsnet Pacific and a game between, say, the Yankees and Tigers on the West channel. If this is a ploy to get people to purchase all four of their regional channels, Sportsnet is playing dirty pool. Frankly, I am surprised an unhappy Jays fan in the West hasn't gone Roger Millions on them . . . Phoenix Coyotes president Doug Moss says the NHL is not running the team and it is business as usual. What does that mean? Another day of not paying bills? . . . More Hough: "Some previously unknown letters written by Benjamin Franklin have been found. In one, the Philadelphia leader excitedly chronicled watching the rookie debut of Jamie Moyer." . . . Littlejohn, with news Heisman Award winners Tim Brown and Gino Torretta are headed to the College Football Hall of Fame: "Brown plans to donate a signed NFL football, while Torretta will donate a signed NFL clipboard.'' . . . Dwight Perry of the Seattle Times, after makers of M&M's announced the popular candy is now available in the colours of all 30 NBA teams: "Enhancing the authenticity, the Clippers M&M's even melt in your hands." . . . Wilken, on American officials advising citizens to avoid large crowds during the swine flu scare: "They are suggesting people stay home or stick to sparsely populated areas like the Yankees' box seats.''</p>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- B.C. Liberal Leader Gordon Campbell took time off the campaign trail yesterday to warn British Columbians to prepare for a growing number of cases of flu that could yet result in some deaths.</p>
<p>Until now, public-health officials have handled the daily updates on the spread of the H1N1 flu in B.C., but Mr. Campbell asked to take part in a news conference at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, saying he wanted to assure the public that his government is staying on top of the flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The issue had not been raised in the campaign – both leaders of the main political parties pledged earlier in the week not to bring the topic into the political fray.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell repeated the key message from public-health officials this week: that workers and students should isolate themselves if they have a cough or a fever by staying home for a week regardless of where they have travelled.</p>
<p>“I think it's important for everyone to realize our experts expect the number of cases will continue to rise; unfortunately we may see some deaths,” he said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, an elementary school in Vernon closed and four more cases were confirmed overnight, including a child under the age of five who was in contact with someone who had recently returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Campbell noted that people die from influenza each year in B.C., and the briefing stressed that the 19 cases confirmed by yesterday have been mild.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, the provincial health officer, stood by as Mr. Campbell conducted the morning news conference.</p>
<p>He then thanked Mr. Campbell “for contextualizing this situation … for everybody and for reiterating so clearly the key public-health messages.”</p>
<p>Asked why he felt he needed to be at the briefing, Mr. Campbell said he wanted to reassure the public that despite the election campaign, the government is still working to respond.</p>
<p>“I think it was important to point out that all of government remains actively involved,” he said.</p>
<p>But New Democratic Party Leader Carole James questioned why it was that the Liberal Leader needed to deliver that message in the middle of the election campaign.</p>
<p>“I think he has to be careful,” she said.</p>
<p>“If it's public information that's being portrayed, public officials could probably do that.”</p>

<p>So, according to Canada's Pandemic Influenza Plan, a pandemic flu could kill between 11,000 and 58,000 Canadians, could result in the hospitalization of double that, and could have a devastating impact on the economy (Provinces Release Flu Drugs As Canada Ramps Up Response – front page, May 1). That sounds pretty bad, right? Certainly bad enough to justify the 55 million doses of antiviral flu drugs held by the federal government.</p>
<p>Let's be clear on the facts. These drugs do not provide immunity, and do not prevent people from getting the flu. They may marginally lesson symptoms of those who are infected, but a 2006 review of all the studies of antivirals such as Relenza and Tamiflu found that, for prevention of influenza, “compared to placebo, [these drugs] have no [significant] effect against influenza-like illnesses.” There is no evidence these drugs would be effective against swine flu.</p>
<p>Creating the scenario where there may be shortages and distribution problems of drugs that basically don't work seems to me to be of huge benefit to the drug manufacturers but only adds to needless anxiety on the part of everyone else.</p>

<div>Q & A: HOW TO STOP THE MELTDOWN</div>
<div>Focus</div>
<div id="hd"><b>The bad-paper trail: Where are the toxic assets? To restore trust in the financial system, banks must be forced to reveal their balance sheets, Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto tells The Globe and Mail's Margaret Wente</b>

</p>
<p>Peruvian economist Hernando de Soto is famous for his pioneering work on property rights for the poor.</p>
<p>Mr. de Soto argues that delivering formal property rights to poor people can bring them out of the sway of demagogues and into the modern global economy, and he has helped to carry out reform programs in 20 countries.</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">New York Times Magazine</span> wrote, “To the leaders of poor countries, de Soto's economic gospel is one of the most hopeful things they have heard in years.”</p>
<p>For his challenge to the status quo, the Shining Path, the Peruvian Marxist terrorist group, targeted him for assassination. His offices were bombed and his car was machine-gunned. Today, the Shining Path is moribund, and Mr. de Soto continues his passionate mission.</p>
<p>On Monday, the president of the Institute for Liberty and Democracy in Lima will be in Toronto to speak about the global meltdown as part of the Grano lecture series. On June 1, he will return to the city to take part in the third semi-annual Munk Debate on the proposition that foreign aid to developing countries does more harm than good.</p>
<p>In a conversation on the spiralling economy, Mr. de Soto explains how important it is to shine a light on “toxic” assets in order to avoid a further meltdown.</p>
<p>You argue that the economic crisis is about paper, not bubbles. What do you mean?</p>
<p>The subprime mortgage defaults were a tiny, tiny problem. They were just the trigger. The real cause is all the assets people can't find – because,</p>
<p>as opposed to all the other assets in the world, there's no record of them. They can't be traced, they can't be priced.</p>
<p>All the cash in the world – all the bank notes and coins – amounts to about $13-trillion. All the paper in the world – the mortgages, bonds and all the rest – amounts to about $176-trillion. But the nominal value of all the derivatives out there is around $1-quadrillion. It far exceeds any other kind of paper, and we have no track of it, and nobody seems to be able to take it out of the system. If you want to get credit flowing again, you have to restore trust in paper as soon as possible.</p>
<p>If the law obliged all the holders of these assets to record them, then you would know who is holding the bad stuff and who is holding the good stuff. Only three or four trillion may be non-performing or toxic – we don't know. The problem is that a lot of major institutions are holding these assets and would be insolvent if they were recognized. Sooner or later, with strategy, and diplomacy, we have to put that number on the table.</p>
<p>The hard decisions about locating, valuing and isolating the toxic paper, and figuring out who will foot the bill for the losses, will be easier to make the sooner politicians realize that the alternative could be collapse of the very system that has generated the most prosperity in history.</p>
<p>The root of the problem sounds strangely like the problem you've identified in poor countries – where everything is informal and nothing is written down.</p>
<p>Having everything on the record is the basis of the legal economy. Everybody's property is recorded, every auto, every airplane, every boat, every patent, every piece of land, every passport. Global business is mostly about doing business with people you never met. Having things recorded is what allows people to trust each other.</p>
<p>One of the accusations against the Third World is that we have huge unrecorded extralegal economies. Now, you in the West have got the biggest one of them all.</p>
<p>But a lot of people worry that if the real magnitude of the problem is made public, a lot of big banks would break and trigger even more panic.</p>
<p>You can't act unless you have a diagnosis. You can't treat a swine-flu pandemic unless everybody reports. The secrecy surrounding derivatives have already cost us more than $60-trillion of our assets.</p>
<p>So, find a discreet way of doing it. I suspect the idea of nationalizing banks is a way to work it out within four closed walls. You've got to figure out how much good paper you have and how much bad paper you have and get the toxic stuff out of the system to restore trust.</p>
<p>The destruction of real value that's taking place so that a few bankers don't have to reveal the state of their balance sheet is phenomenal. Businesses going bust are far worse than stock-market declines. Stocks can go back up – but when a business goes bust, you can't put it back together again.</p>
<p>Is this the end of capitalism as we know it?</p>
<p>The global market system is going to stay. But the consequences of this meltdown are not only economic. Since Bretton Woods, the West has been telling the world they know what works, and the rules of the game are the IMF, GATT, the WHO, and so on.</p>
<p>But now, the consequences of this meltdown – for poverty, for civil conflict – will be tremendous. You've asked us to deal with our mercantilist elite. Now, you've got to deal with yours.</p>
<p>If you don't isolate the problem, it's going to spread like swine flu.</p>

<div>FLU OUTBREAK: NUMBER OF CASES GROWS</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Lessons of 1976: flu, fear, wasted millions; Governments scrambling for solutions to current outbreak risk repeating mistakes of a decades-old health-scare fiasco</b>
</div><div>LES PERREAUX   </div>
<div>1492 words</div><div>2 May 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- The great swine-flu scare of 1976 is remembered in the United States as a costly public-health fiasco during which more people died from vaccinations than the dreaded influenza.</p>
<p>In Canada, it's hardly remembered at all, though it remains vivid to Marc Lalonde, who as federal health minister in 1976 ordered some 10 million doses of vaccine.</p>
<p>“Ah, mon Dieu, that was the time I threw away $10-million,” Mr. Lalonde said in an interview yesterday. “But that is the nature of these things. If you do too little, you are accused of negligence. If you do too much, you are wasting money and causing panic. These are very difficult calls.”</p>
<p>Canadian and international health authorities are facing similar tough decisions as the flu continued to spread yesterday.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of confirmed flu cases climbed to 55, as Nova Scotia, Ontario and British Columbia reported several new cases each, all of them accompanied by dire warnings that additional cases were all but certain and deaths a very real possibility. Prime Minister Stephen Harper said he did not “sense a panic” in the country.</p>
<p>The government announced an expanded prevention campaign that will target mainstream media and social-networking sites such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter and YouTube, and emphasize the importance of hand-washing, covering sneezes and staying home when sick.</p>
<p>As the World Health Organization and public-health officials and scientists pursue a vaccine for the 2009 flu outbreak, the Canadian and U.S. experiences from 1976 offer contrasting cautionary tales.</p>
<p>THE POLITICS OF VACCINATION</p>
<p>The waste of some dollars in Canada back in 1976 was nothing next to the hysteria triggered in the U.S. by a toxic mix of flu, suspicion and politics.</p>
<p>When a sudden February outbreak of flu killed a single soldier at Fort Dix in New Jersey, officials in Ottawa warned Mr. Lalonde: Deadly swine flu could be on the way. With little fanfare, Mr. Lalonde ordered the vaccine and offered it to the provinces to distribute.</p>
<p>“There was no big announcement about it,” he said. “If there was a big announcement and nothing happened, we'd be accused of throwing away money afterward. But we wanted to go on the side of prudence.”</p>
<p>In turned out, there was no flu pandemic. Only 800,000 Canadians, mostly in Ontario, bothered to get the flu shot. The next year, Canada's nine million unused doses of vaccine expired and were eventually flushed.</p>
<p>In the U.S., president Gerald Ford was in the thick of primary election campaigning when the flu struck down the soldier. In March of 1976, he assembled a summit of scientists and ordered vaccinations for all 220 million Americans.</p>
<p>By December, 45 million Americans had received the shot but the program was in tatters. Two dozen deaths from Guillain-Barré Syndrome were blamed on the vaccine, though no conclusive link was ever proven.</p>
<p>The swine influenza outbreak was limited to the one death and a couple hundred sick soldiers in the barracks at Fort Dix. Scientists never solved the mystery of the outbreak's origin and limited spread.</p>
<p>The head of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control was fired and Gerald Ford lost to his Democratic opponent, Jimmy Carter, although the flu fiasco was just one factor in his defeat.</p>
<p>COSTLY MISTAKES</p>
<p>The world was due for a flu pandemic on the chilly day in February, 1976, when Private David Lewis told a superior he was feeling under the weather. The 19-year-old recruit still insisted on setting out from Fort Dix on the day's big hike.</p>
<p>Twenty-four hours later, Pte. Lewis was dead. Within two weeks, public-health officials announced to Americans that the swine flu, which was erroneously believed to be at the root of the catastrophic 1918 pandemic, was back.</p>
<p>Mr. Ford, fighting Ronald Reagan for the Republican nomination and desperate to show he was a man of action, quickly convened experts, including Jonas Salk and Albert Sabin, the men behind the polio vaccine.</p>
<p>Time was pressing. The full brunt of any influenza epidemic was expected with flu season the following autumn, and several months would be needed to produce enough vaccine. In an added twist, the flock of specialized chickens whose eggs were used to produce the annual flu vaccine was about to be slaughtered.</p>
<p>One month after Pte. Lewis's death, President Ford, with Dr. Salk and Dr. Sabin sharing the stage, announced on national television that the government would spend $135-million to “inoculate every man, woman and child in the United States.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ford tried to walk the now-familiar line between warning citizens and provoking panic.</p>
<p>“There is a very real possibility that unless we take effective counteractions, there could be an epidemic of this dangerous disease next fall and winter here in the United States,” President Ford said. He then added that the “facts suggest there is no cause for alarm.”</p>
<p>U.S. health authorities added to the anxiety, airing ominous public-service announcements warning how easily death could be spread. One TV sample is now the butt of jokes on YouTube.</p>
<p>In 1976, Ronald St. John was a public-health foot soldier mesmerized by the battle plan on the wall of his boss's office at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta. The chart mapped out how the government would implement President Ford's plan. But there were unexpected pitfalls.</p>
<p>DEATHS AND LAWSUITS</p>
<p>The vaccine got a serious image problem after pharmaceutical companies loudly demanded and received immunity from civil suits that might arise from complications. And arise, they did. Within months, a spike in cases of paralysis from Guillain-Barré Syndrome – a disorder in which the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system – was reported, including 25 deaths. The cases were quickly pinned on the vaccine and the U.S. government spent $90-million settling lawsuits. (Reports later surfaced later of a few mild cases of GBS in Canada.)</p>
<p>In the wake of Watergate and the Vietnam War, many U.S. citizens were prepared to believe that officials were trying to hide serious complications when they insisted the vaccine was safe.</p>
<p>“The deaths were never definitively proven to be caused by the vaccine … but nobody trusted the federal government with anything,” said Howard Markel, a physician and medical historian at the University of Michigan.</p>
<p>With no new flu cases, the U.S. vaccination program was halted in mid-December of 1976. Canada also mothballed the vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. St. John, who had a 30-year career at the CDC before moving to Health Canada and eventually taking charge of pandemic preparedness, said it's too simplistic to write off the 1976 experience as a pointless fiasco.</p>
<p>“You had a difficult dilemma, making decisions with uncertain and incomplete information,” said Dr. St. John, who retired from Health Canada in 2006. “There was a possibility of a very high mortality rate and there were a lot of unknowns. The reaction cost the director of the CDC his job and it wasn't fair. Too late, too early, it's a tough decision.”</p>
<p>Dr. Markel said his research has convinced him the 1976 U.S. program was far from a misguided disaster.</p>
<p>“The words ‘fiasco' and ‘failure' were attached to it forever, but political theatre is different from medical science, even if they sometimes collide in the field of public health,” he said.</p>
<p>“If I had been in the room, I would have done the same thing. And I suspect officials today will be making the same decision soon.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Flu: the numbers</p>
<p>At the latest count, 14 countries have confirmed cases of the swine flu, with those and others around the world also reporting suspected cases.</p>

<div>THE FLU OUTBREAK: LAB FINDINGS</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Health officials express cautious optimism; Genetic analysis of H1N1 virus done in six countries, including Canada, does not show the markers for virulence seen in 1918 outbreak</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA and TORONTO -- Armed with a week of scientific data, health experts around the world expressed cautious optimism yesterday that a new strain of influenza will not evolve into the type of scourge that killed tens of millions in 1918.</p>
<p>The confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus “so far in Canada and the U.S. have been more typical of seasonal [flu] – and mild seasonal flu, not even a severe seasonal flu,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, told an afternoon news conference.</p>
<p>But “nobody is in a position to predict what will happen. As we know, in 1918 the first round was much milder than the second round and we have to be prepared for that possibility.”</p>
<p>Nancy Cox, the chief of the influenza division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta, said the genetic analysis of the virus that has been conducted in six countries, including Canada, is promising.</p>
<p>“What we have found by looking very carefully at the sequences of the new H1N1 viruses is that we do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus,” Dr. Cox told a teleconference.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the number of confirmed cases in Canada was 55.</p>
<p>Six of the new cases reported were in Nova Scotia, all of them connected to an outbreak at King's-Edgehill School. There were also four new cases in Ontario, two in Alberta, four in British Columbia, one in New Brunswick and one in Quebec. None of them were deemed life-threatening.</p>
<p>A Mexican tourist visiting Hong Kong became Asia's first confirmed case. Authorities in that territory quarantined about 300 people at a hotel where the tourist stayed and began searching for those he may have contacted.</p>
<p>In the United States, President Barack Obama said it is not clear the swine-flu outbreak is any worse than “ordinary flu.”</p>
<p>But he said agencies across his government are preparing for the worst. Even if the new flu “is relatively mild on the front end,” he said, “it could come back in a more virulent form during the actual flu season.”</p>
<p>Chris Bauch, an associate professor of mathematics and statistics at the University of Guelph, said he and a team of math modelers have been asked by the Ontario government to make predictions on how the virus will spread.</p>
<p>Prof. Bauch will release his findings in two weeks. But he said early indicators show that this virus is not as transmissible as some pandemics in the past.</p>
<p>He said it will likely not spread as far and as fast because spring is the end of the traditional flu season. But it could pick up again in the fall.</p>
<p>“It's not 1918. Our ability to respond is better. We have better medical treatments,” he said.</p>
<p>But Prof. Bauch says we should remain vigilant.</p>
<p>“I think we should be very concerned,” he said. “It's not just a question of what's likely to happen over the next few weeks, it's also what could happen down the line, for example in the fall. Even if the infection seems mild now, it could mutate.”</p>
<p>The Canadian government has launched what it is calling a Citizen Readiness Campaign to provide tips for reducing the chance of transmission.</p>
<p>“We will give you the information you need to make the right decisions for you and your family,” said Dr. Butler-Jones. “In addition to mainstream media, we are using a variety of social media such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter to make sure that these important messages are reaching all Canadians.”</p>
<p>Dr. Cox, meanwhile, said preliminary research suggests people 60 and older have some antibodies that may offer protection against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Her team is seeing higher levels of antibodies that are reactive with the virus in people starting at about age 50, but the rise is more noticeable in people 60 and older.</p>
<p>Health officials in the United States say the median age of those infected in that country is 17. Canada has not done that kind of breakdown.</p>
<p>But “clearly when you think of the school involvement in Nova Scotia, of the other cases across the country, many of them are young. They are also young people who have travelled to Mexico on holiday, for March break, et cetera,” said Dr. Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>“So the age distribution is young. But you also expect that. Early on in influenza outbreaks, even seasonal flu, we see cases in young people, and spread among young people before we see it in older persons.”</p>

<p>These are great days. Oh yes, there's the swine flu threat. There is only one Canadian team left in the NHL playoffs. Big companies are going bust. Iggy Ignatieff, that intellectual fella who came back to lead us, is droning away at the Liberal convention in Vancouver. Inane Hollywood movies just keep coming. But cheer up. There's a lot on TV. Too much to see when it's new. There's always a chance to catch up, have a laugh and be entertained. You gotta love a weekend kickin' back and catching up.</p>
<p>Law & Order: SVU</p>
<p>Saturday, NBC, CTV, 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Saturdays are crime nights on NBC and CTV. This Law & Order: SVU is a juicy one with Carol Burnett as a former Rockette mixed up in a strip-club mess with very bad men. It's followed by Southland, 9 p.m., the excellent, tough-minded new cop drama set in the sad, mean streets of L.A. Then at 10 p.m. it's a Law & Order episode, a weird one about a trail of mysterious e-mails from a fundamentalist-religious website that lead detectives to the dead body of one of the site's creators. If you want a true crime investigation, check out W-Five (CTV, 7 p.m.), which has Victor Malarek investigating how some Canadian criminals can very easily dodge warrants for their arrest. By the way, on W tonight at 8 p.m., an airing of the Jennifer Garner movie 13 Going on 30 is used for the Sleepover for Self-Esteem campaign aimed at young women. Candice Olson from Divine Design hosts the movie and, apparently, “the ultimate sleepover party.”</p>
<p>Shut Up & Sing</p>
<p>Sunday, CMT 9 p.m.</p>
<p>This takes us back to the recent, strange days in the pre-Obama United States. The movie is summarized by its tagline: “Freedom of speech is fine as long as you don't do it in public.” Remember that in 2003, the Dixie Chicks, then the top-selling female country artists, started a battle in the U.S. culture wars. At a concert in London, just after anti-Iraq War protests there, lead singer Natalie Maines told the crowd that she was ashamed George W. Bush was from her home state of Texas. The U.S. backlash was fast and furious. The Dixie Chicks were condemned and a vast number of radio stations banned their music. Here, directors Barbara Kopple (Harlan County U.S.A.) and Cecilia Peck chronicle how the band and their supporters dealt with the storm – with dignity and, at times, fury. In retrospect, this is an illuminating and very scary picture of Bush-era America.</p>
<p>Rescue Me</p>
<p>Sunday, Showcase 10 p.m.</p>
<p>This drama – new episodes have been running for a couple of weeks – is back after a long absence. And it has loosened up. Co-creator and star Denis Leary is still there as tortured firefighter Tommy Gavin, but things have changed. The impact of 9/11 grows more distant, though his personal life is still a mess. Gavin still rants eloquently, and he's funnier now. But his father has died and, in the Leary-version of the world (relationships with fathers are key parts of Leary's comedy routines), that is hugely significant. One major storyline this season has Michael J. Fox as a guest-star – his character seems to be romantically involved with Tommy's ex-wife, Janet (Andrea Roth), and then there's a rookie firefighter dating Gavin's daughter, Colleen (Natale Distler). Oh, by the way, the little-seen Dominic Da Vinci movie The Quality of Life (CBC, 8 p.m.) re-airs tonight, and it's excellent, with Nicholas Campbell as Da Vinci, of course, and Mary Walsh as a dangerously manipulative, powerful woman.</p>

<div>Report on Business: Managing</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Getting the job done during a pandemic; Emergency plans developed during SARS are being put into action as businesses brace for the spread of H1N1. Experts say workplaces can be a key source of contagion</b>

</p>
<p>When the World Health Organization bumped its pandemic alert level to 5 on Wednesday, <span class="companylink">Emera Inc</span>.'s EMA-T health and safety team activated a plan that immediately limited travel requests and meetings bringing large groups together.</p>
<p>The Halifax-based electricity company, which had planned a series of seminars by the Nova Scotia Occupational Health and Safety Committee, is investigating whether guest speakers can instead meet with employees via video link, rather than address 100 workers at a time in a conference room. Under its emergency plan, activated by the WHO's response to swine flu, Emera is also encouraging its 2,200 employees in Nova Scotia and Maine to stay away from big crowds outside of work.</p>
<p>Emera, whose subsidiaries include <span class="companylink">Nova Scotia Power Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Bangor Hydro-Electric Co</span>., went so far as to overhaul plans for its annual meeting in Halifax . The event will be broadcast over the Internet with streaming video and two-way audio so shareholders can ask questions. They also will be able to vote on resolutions online or by phone if they do not want to attend in person.</p>
<p>Like the WHO, companies are bumping up the alert level, having developed plans, as Emera did, in response to crises such as hurricane Juan in 2003 or, as in many cases, the SARS outbreak that same year.</p>
<p>For millions of Canadians, SARS was a frightening few months that disrupted routines and damaged the economy. But for prescient businesses, the respiratory disease was a warning to get ready for pandemics to come.</p>
<p>Besides obvious health concerns, there are business issues to be dealt with. Workplaces can be a key source of contagion – employees sit close together, share washrooms and eat together. And with the recession raising extra fears about job security, many workers may be more tempted to come to work even though they're sick.</p>
<p>Companies should prepare for the possibility that a quarter to a third of their staffs would be sidelined in a pandemic, either because employees are ill or have to care for a sick member of the family, Susan Toutanen, a microbiologist and infectious disease consultant at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said yesterday.</p>
<p>Her estimate is based on figures from past pandemics, which tend to occur in waves, so “it's worthwhile to start preparing for that,” she told human resources professionals in a presentation.</p>
<p>Many are doing just that. On Monday, for example, just as the WHO raised its alert to level 4, Hank Stackhouse was chairing an extraordinary meeting of the corporate response team at Delta Hotels and Resorts.</p>
<p>As chief executive officer of the 44-hotel chain, which houses visitors from around the world, Mr. Stackhouse had been watching closely as swine flu spread beyond Mexico.</p>
<p>After the two-hour meeting in downtown Toronto, six senior executives on the response team moved quickly to prepare the chain's 7,100 employees, all of whom have been shown a public health video and power point presentation this week on procedures such as proper hand washing.</p>
<p>Cleaning at the hotels has gone into overdrive, with bathrooms and doorknobs disinfected more frequently, and extra-strength antibacterial soap placed in bathrooms.</p>
<p>The group is on duty around the clock, working with general managers across the chain. Each manager has a local hotel response team. Staff, who were affected by the 2003 SARS outbreak, were reminded to stay at home if sick, and hand wipes were distributed throughout the chain.</p>
<p>“Clearly the best thing that came out of that was a solid pandemic plan that's now in full deployment, so people aren't questioning what they need to do,” Mr. Stackhouse said.</p>
<p>At <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>., senior managers were already laying the groundwork to deal with future outbreaks before public health officials had brought SARS under control.</p>
<p>The Vancouver-based communications company had an emergency operations plan in place long before SARS struck. But the outbreak intensified efforts to make sure employees would be protected and able to keep working in the event of future pandemics or crises.</p>
<p>Today, six years after SARS gripped the country, almost all Telus office staff across the country are equipped to do their jobs remotely, with the aid of company laptops, software and security programs. About 18,000 employees are able to log in from home anywhere in Canada, including 700 customer service reps who already telecommute.</p>
<p>Like other companies, Telus is monitoring swine flu developments daily. Members of the company's emergency management operations committee gather each morning to assess the spread of the virus and to monitor new guidelines coming from international and domestic public health officials.</p>
<p>“At this point in time, our thinking is that we're not going to reach the need for those 18,000 remote connections. But we could ramp up,” said Kasey Reese, vice-president of risk management and chief internal auditor at Telus.</p>
<p>“One of the key learnings that came to us from SARS, in addition to the technology and being able to support workers, was around the need for timely, accurate and aligned communications across the organization and with the local, provincial and federal health authorities,” he said. Twice a year, Telus tests its business continuity with emergency exercises, including scenarios involving pandemic flu.</p>
<p>The plan to turn its employees into a remote team is not just about pandemic readiness. The benefits of being able to have staff work offsite and to shift work loads to different regions of the country as needed have already been proven repeatedly, Mr. Reese said.</p>
<p>A bad snow storm, for example, will push remote usage up to 3,000 or 4,000 people. In 2003, back-to-back crises tested the concept, beginning with SARS and followed by a massive global computer virus, devastating forest fires in British Columbia, an unparalleled power blackout in eastern Canada and the United States, and, to top it off, the accidental cutting of a key telecommunications cable in downtown Vancouver. A four-month labour dispute at Telus in 2005 also put this emergency planning to the test.</p>
<p>Tom Frank, who oversees business continuity planning for <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span>, spent the week meeting with BMO's chief medical officer and a pandemic planning committee, ensuring staff review emergency plans, keeping top executives in the loop, crafting e-mails to a staff of 37,000 and setting up a hotline for employees.</p>
<p>“SARS definitely gave people a wake-up call,” Mr. Frank says. “There's a huge awareness now about the importance to have strategies and plans to help mitigate the risk to our employees and potentially the risk to our ongoing processes.”</p>
<p>“Anyone who went through SARS is much better prepared now,” says Mario Possamai, a Toronto-based independent consultant who specializes in critical incidents, and who was a senior adviser to the SARS Commission.</p>
<p>He advises employers not to prepare specifically for a pandemic, but rather to plan for a “critical incident” that lasts longer than a few days, causing business interruptions, absenteeism and supply chain disturbances. “If you're ready for a pandemic, you're probably ready for an ice storm or a power outage or a hurricane.”</p>
<p>While some Canadian workplaces may be better prepared than most, efforts are still the exception. About 80 per cent of Canadian executives fret about the impact of a pandemic on their companies, and half have no pandemic plan, a 2008 survey of 418 businesses conducted by Leger Marketing indicates.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>How to prepare</p>
<p>How should workplaces prepare for a swine flu pandemic? Here are tips based on advice from <span class="companylink">McCarthy Tétrault LLP</span>, <span class="companylink">Challenger Gray & Christmas Inc</span>. and the Canadian Centre for Emergency Preparedness:</p>
<p>Preventive measures</p>
<p>Communicate. Alert employees to the symptoms and risks, as well as prevention measures.</p>
<p>Encourage sanitation. Employees should wash their hands when arriving at work and regularly throughout the day. Provide hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Get face masks. Have a stock of inexpensive paper masks available for use if infection hits the office.</p>
<p>Clean equipment daily. Wipe desks, phones and keypads daily with disinfectant, as flu viruses can survive up to 48 hours on hard surfaces.</p>
<p>Ask questions. Consider asking visitors to complete questionnaires about potential symptoms they have or contact they may have had with an infected person. Deny access to those who have any symptoms.</p>
<p>Appoint experts. Establish a pandemic response team including representatives with expertise in human resources, operations, health and safety, and communications.</p>
<p>Workplace precautions</p>
<p>Stagger work hours. This will reduce the number of people working in the office at any one time.</p>
<p>Expand personal space. An infected worker could spend an entire day or two in the office before realizing he or she is sick. Urge workers to suspend close contact, staying at least three feet from each other at all times. Encourage employees to avoid shaking hands.</p>
<p>Limit meetings. Conduct meetings via conference calls rather than gathering people together.</p>
<p>Encourage telecommuting. This will keep people off public transportation and out of the office.</p>
<p>Control safeguards</p>
<p>Send sick workers home. Tell ill workers not to come to work.</p>
<p>Facilitate home work. Provide equipment or ways to connect with the office by computer to allow quarantined employees to work from home.</p>
<p>Identify potential risks. Require employees who travel to disclose if they have been to a swine flu “hot spot.” If so, urge them to work from home for a few days until it is clear they are not infected.</p>
<p>Consider an office shutdown. Assess minimal staffing needs, alternative work locations or telework to get work done without direct human-to-human contact. Check the rules. Contact insurers to determine sickness and disability coverage for employees who may be ordered to stay in quarantine. Ensure that supervisors know what to do based on health and safety laws if employees refuse to work.</p>
<p>Consider care needs. Set up a policy on whether employees can take leave to care for sick family members.</p>
<p>Set up guidelines for communicating with employeesc.</p>

</p>
<p>With its potential to thwart the biggest money-making season for everything from concert tours and blockbuster movies, to theatre productions and festivals, the swine flu looms large over the entertainment industry's summer prospects.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has issued a level-five pandemic alert for the swine flu -- one stage below a full-blown pandemic, when a disease is considered common among the general population. If that happens, it could spell trouble for the entertainment business.</p>
<p>"I think a pandemic would have an immediate and profound impact on these industries," said Michael Mulvey, a marketing and social-trends expert at the Telfer School of Management at the University of Ottawa. "I think a considerable segment of people would avoid going to concerts and movie theatres, because most entertainment consumables are elective expenditures.</p>
<p>"You could watch a movie at home, for instance. You don't even have to go to your local Blockbuster store anymore to rent; you can download movies," Mulvey added. "Home is a sanctuary, a place people fall back to in times of crisis and unease. It happened during the SARS crisis and after 9-11, too, when people avoided public spaces."</p>
<p>U.S. movie studios, gearing up for the summer season, continue to monitor the swine-flu situation in Mexico and the rest of the world. In one week, Paramount's Star Trek is scheduled to open globally, and Warner Brother's Terminator Salvation is set to hit theatres May 20.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Twentieth Century Fox</span> already postponed the Wednesday premiere of X-Men Origins: Wolverine in Mexico City, and delayed the theatrical opening scheduled for Friday, just as the Mexican government asked residents to stay at home, closing schools and the country's movie theatre chains. The Mexican release of Star Trek has also been delayed, while <span class="companylink">Sony</span> has reportedly pushed back two of the country's opening dates: the Da Vinci Code sequel Angels & Demons from May 15 to June 12, and Terminator Salvation from June 5 to July 31.</p>
<p>"We have been closely monitoring the situation in Mexico all week," <span class="companylink">Sony</span>'s Steve Elzer told E! News.</p>
<p>If the measures taken in Mexico City to curb public gatherings are expanded elsewhere, it could be problematic for film-release schedules.</p>
<p>"From the movie studios' perspective, it would be a big deal to shift release dates, because the blockbusters are synchronized worldwide and run on a really tight schedule," Mulvey said.</p>
<p>In the case of concert promoters, he said he hopes they're well-insured, noting the large cost involved in tours. "But to some extent, they have to accept responsibility for their patrons; it's a human right," Mulvey added. "And they don't want to put their customers at risk, because they want them to be there for the future."</p>
<p>One movie box-office expert said it's too early to predict the consequences of a swine-flu scare.</p>
<p>"Certainly, something like this isn't positive for the industry in general -- or any business in general that requires people to go outside the home," said Paul Dergarabedian of Media by Numbers, the box-office tracking company.</p>
<p>Dergarabedian says people are being cautious and washing their hands more, but added, "I think when Star Trek or Wolverine opens, I'd be really surprised if the hard-core fans, or even just the audience that would flock to a movie like that, would suddenly not want to go because of that. I just don't see that happening. Just try to keep Wolverine fans or Star Trek fans away from the movie theatre."</p>
<p>And what might happen to fans who've already bought tickets?</p>
<p>"For people who've already doled out money for upcoming events, such as the Bob Dylan and Fleetwood Mac concerts, you have to decide: Should you stay or should you go? Are you in the infection's target group? How contagious is it?" Mulvey said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The price of preparedness</b>

</p>
<p>Every month, I get $100 from the federal government, or I should say my wife gets a cheque for that amount. It's a small price to pay for Ottawa to compensate me for the costs of raising a four-year-old.</p>
<p>Last month, a flyer was included with my cheque for something called Emergency Preparedness Week, which starts Monday. For the c-note, the least I could do was read the little blurb from Public Safety Canada.</p>
<p>"Is your family prepared?" read the ominous warning from the government.</p>
<p>Apparently, in addition to all the other costs associated with raising two children, I have to be ready for an emergency that could last up to 72 hours. Something tells me my $100 cheque from the government is about to disappear.</p>
<p>The "72-hour campaign" is now in its third year and perhaps the issue has never been more timely with fear of swine flu now sweeping the world.</p>
<p>"We have gone through as a country a series of natural disasters events -- the flood in Manitoba, the ice storm that caused power outages in Ontario. Those events together helped underline the need for better readiness and better preparedness," said Peter Van Loan, Minister of Public Safety, in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Van Loan said the question has come up about whether swine flu is just the latest example of people needing to be prepared.</p>
<p>"It's similar in that one has to worry about broad interests of public safety and public involvement and readiness," said Mr. Van Loan.</p>
<p>"If you end up with a full-scale public health disaster, where people have to stay home, [emergency kits] might have some utility. But you'll probably need something longer than 72 hours." For the most part, he said, there is a normalization in any emergency situation after the first three days.</p>
<p>When it comes to preparedness, the real debate is whether you want to go beyond 72 hours. There are three steps in the 72-hour plan. The first is analyzing the risks in your area, which include everything from earthquakes to hazardous spills.</p>
<p>The second step is to make a plan.</p>
<p>This includes such things as figuring out who could pick up your children if you can't, setting up a meeting place for family to reunite or knowing where your electric box or gas valve is located. The third step is the kit.</p>
<p>How much the kit costs ultimately comes down to what you want to spend to keep yourself safe for a short period of time in an emergency: Do you need to provide for you and your family for three days or 30 days? And what can you not live without? "We know of a person in the city of Toronto who has a $150,000 generator in their backyard. If the city goes down, they can live off the grid. That's the extreme," said Stan Krawitz, of Real Facilities Inc., which advises corporate clients on how to deal with disasters.</p>
<p>"There are lots of differences in what you can spend," said Elinor Fidley, owner of Angel Safety Products, in Fort Langley, B.C. She said food and water for three days is $21.95 a person, according to the Canadian Coast Guard. That includes a 3,600-calorie food bar and 12 half-cup packages of water. "A basic disaster kit is $120 with some basic safety items," said Ms. Fidley, adding that it doesn't include food and water.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No traction for auto sales; April worst in 10 years</b>
</div><div>Star News Services</div>

</p>
<p>Carmakers on Friday reported their worst April Canadian sales in 10 years as the industry's pain continued.</p>
<p>Automakers sold 143,931 vehicles nationwide in April, a 17.8 per cent decline over the same month last year, according to data from DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.</p>
<p>The industry is tracking for sales of 1.35 million vehicles by year-end, a major drop over the 1.65-million range sold over the past few years.</p>
<p>"Don't expect this to get any better," said industry analyst Dennis DesRosiers.</p>
<p>Spring marks the beginning of what is normally the busiest time of the year for sales of new cars and trucks. Without strong sales now, many automakers fear the rest of the year will be a washout.</p>
<p>Several automakers outperformed the market, including Ford, <span class="companylink">Mazda</span> and Hyundai.</p>
<p>Chrysler, which went into bankruptcy protection in the United States Thursday, saw its sales fall 37 per cent.</p>
<p>GM, which announced a revamp Monday that could see the U.S. government become majority owner of the company, reported a 23.6 per cent drop.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Toyota Canada</span> sold 16 per cent fewer cars and trucks, improving on its 23 per cent year-over-year decline in March.</p>
<p>"What we've been seeing is a slow build in the marketplace," said Stephen Beatty, managing director of <span class="companylink">Toyota Canada</span>. "There are spots of strength (in our sales) and that gives me some optimism that the market is turning around."</p>
<p>The story was no less grim in the United States.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Chrysler LLC</span>'s U.S. sales plunged 48 per cent in April, helping drag Toyota, Ford and Nissan to declines that exceeded analysts' estimates.</p>
<p>GM's 34 per cent decrease and Honda's 25 per cent drop were smaller than projections. Chrysler also trailed estimates. Ford slumped 32 per cent, Toyota tumbled 42 per cent and Nissan fell 38 per cent.</p>
<p>The results mean that the U.S. market contracted for an 18th consecutive month, as a rebound in consumer confidence was tempered by Chrysler's filing for court protection and the swine flu outbreak. While industrywide sales fell 34 per cent, that decrease was the smallest in 2009, based on Bloomberg data.</p>
<p>"We've seen stability in demand," said Jesse Toprak, director of industry analysis for automotive research firm <span class="companylink">Edmunds.com</span> in Santa Monica, Calif. "The variable in coming months is how consumers will react to Chrysler."</p>
<p>April sales ran at an annual rate of 9.3 million units, according to industry research firm Autodata of Woodcliff Lake, N.J. That lags behind March's 9.9-million rate, and approaches the 9.1-million rate in February that was the lowest since 1981. Sales totalled 13.2 million in 2008, and averaged 16.8 million this decade through 2007.</p>
<p>With Chrysler in bankruptcy court, the industry's focus now shifts to whether Detroit-based GM can avoid ending up there as well if it can't meet a June 1 restructuring deadline.</p>
<p>"I've seen everything except that a Martian is going to run <span class="companylink">General Motors</span>," the automaker's sales chief, Mark LaNeve, said on a conference call. "We've been fighting every one of these rumours, and I can tell you they don't help sales."</p>
<p>GM beat the average estimate for a 37 per cent sales decline, based on a survey of five analysts. Purchases by fleet customers buoyed results, while sales to individual consumers fell 45 per cent, GM said. Honda was projected to drop 27 per cent, based on four estimates.</p>
<p>Ford's slide exceeded the 30 per cent average estimate among five analysts surveyed by Bloomberg, and Chrysler outstripped projections for a 37 per cent drop. Toyota's decline was greater than the 37 per cent average, while Nissan's slump exceeded a projected decrease of 28 per cent.</p>

</p>
<p>It's likely beyond containment now, but to describe the Mexican swine flu outbreak as a potential rerun of the Spanish Influenza pandemic seems, subject to change without notice, wildly alarmist.</p>
<p>The 1918 influenza pandemic claimed 50,000 of Canada's eight million citizens, almost as many casualties as the First World War, while statistically shortening the average lifespan by 10 years. One doctor observed at the time that some patients "died struggling to clear their airways of a blood-tinged froth that sometimes gushed from their nose and mouth." Yuck. That virus hit with astonishing speed in an age before vaccines were mass produced. One newspaper reported that four women had been happily playing bridge late into the night. By the next morning, three were dead.</p>
<p>The Alberta government ordered all residents to wear masks outdoors that horrific autumn. A sneeze or a cough in a public place would cost you a fine in Regina. The infected number hit 19 on Wednesday in Canada as the government ramped up a travel warning against going to Mexico.</p>
<p>At statistical face value, lathering up the current outbreak into an all-consuming global crisis, one that saw U.S President Barack Obama unleash $1.8 billion for American defences against the bug, seems ludicrous.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization says 1,900 Mexicans are being monitored for showing symptoms of the virus, but there are only 26 confirmed cases. The rest of the world combined has still not cracked into triple digits and symptoms have been so regular-flu mild, most victims are fully recovered before tests confirm they had the virus.</p>
<p>Even so, the WHO went to unprecedented Phase 4 of its six-stage alert to signal a sustained human-to-human transmission virus is on the loose, riding jetstreams around the world with the capacity to deliver community-wide sickness. The trouble with assessing pandemic responses is the impossibility of arguing against an abundance of precaution while the scale of the outbreak rages as hypothetical, and expert opinion on its potential ranges from grave danger to a basic flu.</p>
<p>But the Government of Canada has so far taken a more reasonable response to the swine flu crisis than the American throw-more-money approach or the Asian travel bans to North America, admitting nervous concern and rushing to get a vaccine out without signs of dramatic panic.</p>
<p>While one opposition MP's proposal to strike a special committee to monitor the outbreak was correctly shrugged off by the government as pointless political posturing, questions of the government in the Commons have been a search for important information.</p>
<p>MPs on Tuesday merely wanted to know the potential timetable for a swine flu vaccine and asked if migrant workers from Mexico, who might be heading here for summer work, would be tested at the border. Both are legitimate concerns. The website by Health Canada, a federal department ironically born out of the 1918 pandemic, is informative and appears current.</p>
<p>The reaction by medical experts has been equally reassuring. When they know the answer, they give it. When they don't have solid data, they admit that too with a shrug. Deaths are likely as the outbreak spreads, they warned, but to suggest otherwise would be sugar-coating reality. Every year, 500 to 1,500 Canadians succumb to regular flu strains. It only stands to reason a more severe bug would have similar deadly consequences.</p>
<p>If nothing else, consider the bright side to this ruckus.</p>
<p>If the pandemic fizzles, Mexican vacations next winter will be had at giveaway prices.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Suspected cases of local swine flu increase to 20</b>
</div><div>Dave Battagello   </div>

</p>
<p>The number of suspected swine flu cases in the area has risen to 20, but none have been confirmed, the local medical officer of health said Friday.</p>
<p>Dr. Allen Heimann said he expects a handful of cases will be confirmed sometime in the next few days pending lab test results.</p>
<p>"I'd be surprised if we didn't (have any confirmations) just looking at the odds of what has happened in other jurisdictions," Heimann said.</p>
<p>It could be that many of the individuals will have already recovered having had swine flu so mild that it failed to affect their overall well-being, he said.</p>
<p>"I'm not worried at this point, but I'm concerned," Heimann said. "Looking at the confirmed cases so far, they continue to be mild."</p>
<p>There were 2,800 cases of seasonal flu this past season in Windsor and Essex County with no deaths, he said.</p>
<p>"Because this is new we are asking for additional prevention in hospitals and informing residents to take appropriate precautions," Heimann said.</p>
<p>At Windsor Regional Hospital, many patients and staff were wearing surgical masks in the hallways and waiting rooms Friday.</p>
<p>Every visitor was being screened by security guards who asked if they had a cough or fever and whether they had recently travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>"If it's a patient coming in here we mask them, deal with their medical issue, then also treat their cough and fever and test them," said hospital CEO David Musyj.</p>
<p>"There is a concern because there are patients exhibiting symptoms. Luckily, at this point, nothing has happened."</p>
<p>In Windsor, spread of swine flu could come fast, Musyj said. With children in schools, weekend gatherings, community events, it would spread quickly, he said.</p>
<p>"It might be we have nothing for an extended period, but it would not take much to snowball quickly and that's the major concern," Musyj said.</p>
<p>With 3,000 employees, 500 physicians, patients and hundreds of visitors each day, there is also concern at the hospital about what an outbreak would mean internally, Musyj said.</p>
<p>"We are a city in itself," he said. "That's why we are restricting access to entrances and taking precautions."</p>

<p>Re: Swine Flu Isn't So Scary, editorial, April 30.</p>
<p>The rapid proliferation of swine-flu throughout the world should make each and every one of us shutter in our boots. Had this virus been potent as was the SARS, even for masked and gowned hospital workers, then I suspect that the Post would be singing a different tune. Nonetheless, the Canadian government should have placed a travel advisory on flights in and out of Mexico much earlier than it did. We allowed the virus to enter our country unimpeded as there were no travel restrictions, even when we had seven confirmed Canadian cases. The genie was out of the bottle and we kept the lid open.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hysteria seems to be spreading faster than swine flu itself; 'Not A Crisis:' Expert</b>

</p>
<p>In the U. S., schools have closed, concerts cancelled and stores sold out of protective surgical masks , and yet the toll of the swine flu is 141 confirmed cases of illness and one death.</p>
<p>In Canada, school trips have been scrapped, Catholic priests in Edmonton recommend worshippers avoid shaking fellow parishioners' hands, and some people have dropped pork from their diet in a country with 51 known "mild" cases.</p>
<p>Nearly half of Canadians were concerned they or someone in their family might contract swine flu, says an Ipsos Reid poll for Canwest News Service; 15% of 1,001 adults recently surveyed said they were "very" concerned.</p>
<p>It leaves some critics fearing that swine flu hysteria is spreading faster than the virus itself. "People react strongly to the unknown," said Annalee Yassi, professor in the school of population and public health at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>"Whenever something is new and it is uncertain what the magnitude of the risk will be, people will react more than to something that is familiar -- even if a familiar risk is a whole lot riskier," she said.</p>
<p>There is certainly an awkward teetering between panic and calm; people weighing stories of an imminent pandemic with news that the cases in Canada amount to a mild bout of the flu.</p>
<p>Health officials and world leaders have not always been helpful. The World Health Organization raised its global pandemic alert to Level 5, its second-highest level, while not recommending travel restrictions; Joe Biden, the U. S. Vice-President, declared that people should avoid air travel and riding subways, earning him the nickname "VP of Panic" from critics.</p>
<p>Even the Web site for the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention places the swine flu warning below its alert of salmonella found in raw alfalfa sprouts.</p>
<p>In Canada, companies have sent out e-mails about the "outbreak," leading to overloaded servers as workers seek information. Some daycares have sent notices home to parents.</p>
<p>The advice in most of these serious-sounding alerts, however, seems both everyday and common sense: cover your cough; don't share drinks; stay home if you're sick; see a doctor if you have severe flu symptoms.</p>
<p>"All the talk of pandemics just gets people worked up, when what we're looking at here is a public health problem," said Philip Alcabes, a professor of urban public health at the City University of New York and author of Dread: How Fear and Fantasy Have Fueled Epidemics from the Black Death to the Avian Flu. People are getting sick, he said, "but it's not a crisis."</p>
<p>Mr. Alcabes said public perception is tainted by images from the devastation of the 1918 Spanish flu, when horse-drawn carriages collected the dead from the streets. "We can calm down and take some reassurance in the statistic that, even what was by far, by an order of magnitude, the worst single disease disaster in history, the chances of living were far better than the chances of dying, even in a day when there wasn't much to be done."</p>
<p>So, while some don face masks, others just make light of the situation. Asked if he was afraid of using the subway, one Toronto pedestrian quipped: "Is that why they call this Hogtown?"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Smart money is pushing away from the table; Jump in now and you may get stuck with the bill</b>

</p>
<p>Are you ready for dessert? Perhaps some flan or small slice of gateaux? Or are you too full--completo, as the Spanish say -- after the appetizer and the entree? Oh well, we'll give you some time to think about it while you enjoy your coffee.</p>
<p>On Wall Street, which knows a thing or two about gluttony and crash dieting, it's said that the big, smart money is first at the market rally table, tucking into the first and second courses, while the little guy shows up just for what the English call pudding. Moreover, he can often get stuck with the tab after the big guys have pushed away from the table.</p>
<p>With the major indexes up more than 25% since March 9, some people who have been watching the big money chowing down will now be tempted to belly up to the table just as the big money is contemplating pushing away.</p>
<p>One could sense a little of that slightly full, wait-and-see feeling creeping into the market this week. The main U. S. indexes ended the week with modest gains, to extend their weekly run to eight straight. The Canadian market ended the week with a small loss despite yesterday's 2% rally to end its run at seven up weeks.</p>
<p>The market's iffy action during a week dominated by news from the swine flu and auto fronts was punctuated Wednesday by a rally ostensibly triggered by the first-quarter U. S. GDP report. Such was the continuing appetite for stocks that a larger-than-expected 6.1% drop in output was viewed as a positive.</p>
<p>The Financial Post captured the market mood with the front-page headline "U. S. GDP So Bad It's Good," reflecting a view that such a big pullback should set the stage for an economic rebound, that when things were that bad, they could only get better. And reports yesterday showed improvements from dismal levels in both U. S. consumer confidence and manufacturing.</p>
<p>Meantime, U. S. earnings, though down about 33% in the first quarter, were beginning to beat analysts' estimates, evidence to some that the rally was justified and it was prudent to keep sitting at the table and keep nibbling away.</p>
<p>Of course, many of those at the table have been there all along. These buy-and-holders are still suffering equity portfolio losses of around 35% from the bull-market highs.</p>
<p>Long-time readers will know that Market Eye is predisposed to caution: If I'd been at the table in any big way, I'd probably have already pushed away and took some of the food with me. If I'd not been at the table, worrying and watching, I'd be most reluctant to sit down for what could be a little dessert and a big tab.</p>
<p>True, there is evidence here and there that the worst of the financial crisis is over and that most people are more confident than they were a couple of months ago. And, true, confidence is essential to economic and market recovery.</p>
<p>This just may turn out to be the rally that begins the new bull market, that the table is a still a groaning board of a feast. That seemed the mood yesterday among Canadian investors as the resource stocks, which are tied to world recovery, led the way.</p>
<p>But the higher and the faster the indexes climb, the more likely a pullback becomes as the big, confident players get set to put down their utensils, fold their napkins and push back from the table. Any reversal in the market is likely to be severe, though the levels of early March are probably secure. And, yes, a pullback could set the stage for a further big move upward -- one in which the big, quick money could have another hearty repast.</p>
<p>I'm thinking, though, that now we're into May and summer beckons there's a chance that it might be time to push away from the table and head out for what might be a teddy bears' picnic.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Prep school a window to pandemic; WHO works with New York City and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track spread of virus</b>

</p>
<p>A key reason for world health authorities fearing a pandemic is imminent is how the H1N1 or swine flu behaved at a New York school where hundreds of people got sick within days.</p>
<p>The symptoms of students at St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, a borough of New York City, are similar to those of seasonal flu, the city health commissioner, Thomas Frieden, said. What has officials concerned is that some of the 47 people at the school confirmed to be infected with H1N1 are likely to have spread the virus to hundreds of friends and family members.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is working with the city and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track the swine flu among relatives, staff and students at the school, said Gregory Hartl, a WHO spokesman in Geneva. If the flu can move quickly within such a community, it most likely can leap national borders just as easily, a finding WHO officials said helped convince the agency to raise its alert levels.</p>
<p>"We will learn many things from St. Francis, but it reminds us that flu spreads and when it gets into an environment that is closed it spreads quickly," Frieden said at a press conference Wednesday. "It is probable that it spread so quickly because it is a new strain."</p>
<p>New York City's health department has asked more than 1,000 students, teachers and staff members at St. Francis to fill out questionnaires on their health and contacts over the past few days, Frieden said.</p>
<p>All except two of the cases of H1N1 flu in the city confirmed by tests are connected to St. Francis and "many hundreds" more at the school may have been infected, Frieden said.</p>
<p>Eighty-two of 389 students at a nearby public school, P.S. 177, also called in sick with flu-like symptoms. One student at P.S. 177 had a sibling at St. Francis, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said.</p>
<p>The St. Francis outbreak began last week when students returned from a weeklong spring break. New York health officials said several traveled to Cancun, Mexico.</p>
<p>Stephanie Maglaras, a student at St. Francis, started feeling sick on April 21, she said in an e-mail interview. Throughout the week, students started going home ill and, by April 23, the line at the nurse's office stretched down the hallway, she said. Maglaras said she had nausea, vomiting, headache, body ache, coughing, sneezing and a runny nose.</p>
<p>Frieden said it is likely that many, if not all, of the students who have been ill at St. Francis have the swine flu. During a two-day period, 224 students at St. Francis went home sick, Frieden said. The school is closed at least until May 4.</p>
<p>"There were so many rumours going around as to why there were so many sick students," Maglaras said. "The nurse's office was extremely overcrowded, to the point that there was a line of students down the hallway. All of my classes were missing at least five to 10 students."</p>
<p>Maglaras, 14, created a Facebook.com page called "Prep Students Tested Positive for Swine Flu." The page is designed to help students share information about who has the illness and what their symptoms are in response to limited information provided by the school.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing in New York City is that this virus is acting like an influenza virus; so we shouldn't be surprised if there is ongoing and substantial transmission," said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease and Policy, at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. "The zillion-dollar question is how long this transmission activity will last, and what will be the evolving picture of disease severity."</p>

<div>SWINE FLU: COMING TOGETHER IN A TIME OF CRISIS</div>
<div>Comment</div>
<div id="hd"><b>A case for the three amigos; There are three sides to this story – Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. Why not just one?</b>
</div><div>ANDRÉS ROZENTAL AND ROBERT PASTOR  </div>
<div>854 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>A crisis often presents governments with an opportunity that can be either seized or missed. One lost chance came shortly after 9/11, when Mexico asked Canada to jointly negotiate a smart border agreement with the United States, as a way of ensuring that our respective land borders be kept as open as possible under Homeland Security concerns to trade in goods and services. Canada rejected the idea of working together in favour of a separate bilateral negotiation with Washington, mainly because it felt its own relationship with the United States was so special that including Mexico would only contaminate the process with issues extraneous to Ottawa's agenda. The result: two nearly identical agreements, signed six months apart, that could have been one of the first trilateral successes of the post-NAFTA era but that, instead, emphasized our differences.</p>
<p>Today, we face another such opportunity. We can only hope that, this time, Canada seizes the moment rather than following the misguided idea that excluding Mexico from the common North American agenda is in its best interest. The swine flu pandemic is an ideal issue on which we should be working together, not only to halt the spread of the virus within our own region and to third countries but to ensure that solidarity among us avoids the adoption of damaging defensive measures by others that will negatively affect trade, tourism and communications to and from all of North America.</p>
<p>The North American free-trade agreement came into being largely because of Canada, which took the lead in negotiating an earlier trade pact with the United States. When Mexico first decided to propose a separate bilateral treaty with Washington, Canada asked to be included. Although Ottawa's initial approach was mainly for defensive reasons and to preserve the gains it had achieved with its earlier bilateral FTA, the decision to negotiate à trois eventually led to the creation of the most formidable free-trade area in the world in terms of territory and, until very recently, gross product and population.</p>
<p>Since NAFTA came into force, trade has tripled and foreign direct investment has quintupled in North America. In its first seven years – until 2001 – integration among the three countries soared. From 1994 to 2001, intra-regional trade as a percentage of our total trade with the world increased from 43 per cent to 57 per cent, almost reaching the levels that Europe only achieved after five decades. But since 2001, the process has stalled, and irritants in the trilateral relationship have emerged. There are several reasons for this, but it's mainly because the three countries of North America have reverted to two bilateral relationships – U.S.-Canada and U.S.-Mexico – rather than approaching our common challenges together.</p>
<p>Recently, some Canadian voices have called for a strategy to dump Mexico and cut deals only with the United States. According to these voices, being associated with Mexico and its drug-trafficking, violence and immigration problems could infect the supposed special relationship between Ottawa and Washington. They say Canada's unique ties with its southern neighbour give it an opportunity to advance its interests more effectively on its own than if Mexico is included, especially on issues related to border security and trade irritants. They must have been very distressed when Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano suggested that the United States prefers to treat its two neighbours and its two borders on the basis of equality. Doesn't Washington know, these Canadians think, that the two borders are so different?</p>
<p>Well, they're actually not that different. In addition to the fact that both are dysfunctional and outdated for the same reasons, many of the issues we face – including the current public health emergency – can only be addressed effectively if we work together. Disease, pollution and international crime cartels don't respect territorial sovereignty, so only a concerted North American strategy can defend us against these and other threats to our health, security and well-being.</p>
<p>Today, Mexico is facing crises of unprecedented proportions. The swine flu epidemic, drugs, violence and a severe economic decline threaten our daily lives and undermine our global competitiveness. Wouldn't this be an ideal opportunity for Canada to join the United States and Mexico in mitigating these threats? Isn't this a great opportunity for Canada to join its North American neighbours and allies in working together, rather than separately?</p>
<p>Canada needs to accept Mexico as a true partner. If it does, the North American concept will be reinvigorated and become an example of progressive co-operative integration, rather than a failed experiment to be disdained and discarded.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO --</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said today it has "no doubt" that a new vaccine to fight swine flu could be made relatively quickly.</p>
<p>Marie-Paule Kieny, the WHO's director of the initiative for vaccine research, said in a conference call from Geneva that it takes anywhere between four to six months between the time the virus is isolated and the first doses are made available to the general public.</p>
<p>"We have no doubt about making a successful vaccine is possible within a relatively short period of time," Dr. Kieny told reporters.</p>
<p>Tests have shown the seasonal influenza vaccine would have little effect against those infected with swine flu, making production of a new vaccine more important.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Protection, the National Microbiology lab in Winnipeg and other labs have isolated the virus and are now trying to grow the new vaccine and determine its effectiveness. Dr. Kieny said this should be done by the end of this month, at the latest.</p>
<p>It will then be shipped to the manufacturer, who fine-tune it, let it grow in eggs and conduct clinical trials on animals such as ferrets.</p>
<p>Dr. Kieny said the WHO has spoken with manufactures in both industrialized and developing countries who are ready to start the process of developing a new vaccine, even though there is a lack of epidemiological information from Mexico and even though this swine flu virus may cause fewer deaths than seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"This is too much of a gamble over public health to say 'well, let's see if it really becomes severe,'" Dr. Kieny said. "Initial steps have already been made, and manufacturers to whom we're in daily contact, are committed to start production of vaccine as soon as possible."</p>
<p>Nancy Cox, the chief of the influenza division of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases in Atlanta, agreed that vaccine production should not be difficult.</p>
<p>Six countries — the United States, Mexico, New Zealand, Canada, the Netherlands, and Germany — have been working together to characterize the genetic makeup of virus samples collected within their jurisdictions, Dr. Cox told an afternoon teleconference.</p>
<p>"The good news is that all of the genes of all of the viruses that we have examined to date are 99 to 100 per cent identical," she said.</p>
<p>"What this means for us is that it will be somewhat easier to produce an influenza vaccine because the viruses that are spreading are so similar to each other."</p>
<p>Health officials around the world are "aggressively" taking the early steps that are necessary to ensure that a vaccine can be produced should a decision be made to go ahead and ramp up to full-scale production, said Dr. Cox.</p>
<p>Officials in Canada have already started discussions with Glaxo Smith Kline, the pharmaceutical company that has the contract to make a vaccine in this country. It is anticipated that it could be ready by the fall — when the virus could become more virulent based on the experience of previous pandemics. Scientists, meanwhile, are trying to determine the severity of the H1N1 virus and its ability to spread from one person to another.</p>
<p>In 1918, a pandemic influenza virus killed an estimated 20 million to 100 million people around the world. The new strain does not seem to pack that deadly sort of punch, said Dr. Cox.</p>
<p>"What we have found by looking very carefully at the sequences of the new H1N1 viruses is that we do not see the markers for virulence that were seen in the 1918 virus," she said.</p>
<p>"However, we know that there is a great deal that we do not understand about the virulence of the 1918 virus or other viruses that have a more severe clinical picture in humans."</p>
<p>The latest numbers out of Mexico suggest that many more people in that country have contracted the virus that originally suspected and that the spread of the disease may explain why it has seemed to be more severe there than in other countries, including Canada.</p>
<p>"In Mexico, their first attention was to more severe illness and we learned about those cases earlier. And, as they have continued to look, I understand they are finding milder cases," Dr. Cox.</p>
<p>But, she warned, "we're trying to understand the severity of this virus or estimate it at a pretty early stage. You might think about … trying to estimate a baseball player's batting average one week into the season."</p>
<p>Anne Schuchat, the interim deputy director for the science and public health program at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said one way to assess how fast a disease will spread is to examine its attack rate. That can be done by looking at families in which there has been one case of the disease and seeing how many other members get sick.</p>
<p>"At this point we are estimating an attack rate that's fairly high, in the 25 to 30 per cent range," she said. "We do think this virus is easily transmitted, similar to seasonal influenza."</p>
<p>The swine flu virus, which WHO now refers to as influenza A H1N1, has spread to 13 countries and killed as many as 176 people. Only one person has died outside of Mexico, the epicentre of the disease — a toddler from Mexico who travelled to the United States.</p>
<p>Hong Kong confirmed its first swine flu case today, Asia's first. A Mexican tourist visiting Hong Kong was diagnosed with swine flu. It may not mean much because it's coming from a traveller, except that it's moving into a very populous part of the world.</p>
<p>Cases outside of Mexico have been relatively mild, but a WHO official noted that the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed millions, started mildly.</p>
<p>"Even though we might be seeing only mild cases now, we cannot say what will happen in the future," spokesman Gregory Hartl said. "It would be remiss of us not to take this very seriously."</p>
<p>Canada has 55 confirmed cases of swine flu in British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec and Alberta. New cases were identified today in British Columbia, Nova Scotia, Ontario and Alberta.</p>
<p>In Alberta, both cases were in Calgary — both women (one young, the other middle-aged). In one of the cases, the woman had recently returned from Mexico. In the other, the person had recently travelled to Tennessee.</p>
<p>André Corriveau, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health, said all of the cases have been mild and none of the patients have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>Dr. Corriveau said it could be a coincidence that seven of the province's eight cases have been found in Calgary.</p>
<p>"We shouldn't read too much into that at this time."</p>
<p>In response to the spread of the virus, the WHO raised its pandemic alert level twice the week, stopping just short of declaring swine flu a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>A new report today by the U.S. CDC said the virus may not be as severe as it first looked, with many mild cases not immediately noticed.</p>
<p>Health authorities have been struggling to explain why there are so many deaths in Mexico and nowhere else. The CDC report suggests there is a simple explanation — there are many cases in Mexico, most are mild, and just the bad ones have been seen so far.</p>
<p>"The clinical spectrum of swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus illness is not yet well characterized in Mexico. However, evidence suggests that swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus transmission is widespread and that less severe (uncomplicated) illness is common," the CDC said in a special report.</p>
<p>"To date, case-finding in Mexico has focused on patients seeking care in hospitals, and the selection of cases for laboratory testing has focused on patients with more severe disease. Therefore, a large number of undetected cases of illness might exist in persons seeking care in primary-care settings or not seeking care at all."</p>
<p>But more information is needed. The CDC has sent test kits to Mexico that will help get a better picture of who is sick. It is difficult to know without special tests because respiratory diseases are so common and many infection look like flu.</p>
<p>"Additional investigations are needed urgently to evaluate the full clinical spectrum of disease in Mexico, the proportion of patients who have severe illness, and the extent of disease transmission," the CDC said.</p>

<p>Director-General Margaret Chan raised the pandemic alert level to 5 in response to the spreading swine flu virus. Phase 5 means that there is human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries, and sends a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent. Phase 6 is a full-blown pandemic.</p>

<p>Canadian officials have closed one school and cancelled trips abroad for students at others as concerns about the swine flu continue to grow.</p>
<p>Health officials in the B.C. city of Vernon announced yesterday it will close Beairsto Elementary School for a week after a student tested positive for swine flu.</p>
<p>The student is experiencing a mild case and is at home recovering.</p>
<p>The school closing is believed to be the first in Canada.</p>
<p>Some high schools and at least one university also cancelled trips to Mexico and the United States over the outbreak of the flu.</p>
<p>The list includes a high school band from Edmonton that returned this week from California, where the flu has sickened 14 people. The band had been scheduled to perform at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Quebec City's Université Laval has asked six students and two professors to return from Mexico, where they are on academic exchanges or internships.</p>
<p>Two Montreal-area high schools - Laurier-MacDonald and John F. Kennedy - have also cancelled plans for trips to New York City.</p>
<p>"We feel that the safety and health of our children come first," said Laurier-MacDonald principal Eileen Kelly. "I'm erring on (the side) of extreme caution."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Virus spreads to Quebec; Mild case; Local patient didn't require quarantine, officials say</b>
</div><div>The Gazette; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>926 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Quebec yesterday recorded its first confirmed case of swine flu - a Montrealer who recently returned from Mexico.</p>
<p>The news from the provincial Health Department came as the federal government announced it was beginning a public awareness campaign about the rapidly spreading illness, and the number of confirmed cases in Canada rose to 34. Worldwide, the number of cases surpassed 270.</p>
<p>As of yesterday evening, Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc's office would not reveal much information about the local case.</p>
<p>The department would not say yesterday whether the patient was male or female.</p>
<p>What was known was that the person was suffering from a mild case of the virus, and was recovering at home in the Montreal region.</p>
<p>The person had recently come back from Mexico and checked into a health institution. The patient was not given an antiviral shot to combat the symptoms of the virus.</p>
<p>"The person is at home and has been given a list of measures to take, as has the family," said Dominique Breton, a spokesperson for Bolduc.</p>
<p>Health officials don't believe the person is contagious, so there was no reason for the patient to be quarantined, Breton said, adding she did not want to give out any information that could allow the patient to be identified.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 15 new cases of the influenza virus were confirmed in Canada - four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario and five in British Columbia, in addition to the Quebecer. All the cases are considered mild.</p>
<p>One of the B.C. cases involves a youngster in Vernon whose infection has prompted a local elementary school to close for the next week. It is the first school closing in Canada because of the illness, which is being blamed for killing a dozen people in Mexico and one person in the United States.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said the new domestic numbers, an increase from 19 confirmed cases Wednesday, do not affect the federal government's approach to dealing with the spread of swine flu across the country.</p>
<p>The officials said the government is sticking to its plan of surveillance, vaccine development, ensuring antiviral supplies are adequate, and providing Canadians with the information they need.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper said there is reason for concern about what he called "the Mexican flu," but added Canadians can be assured that governments around the world are responding in an "appropriate and co-ordinated way."</p>
<p>"I believe we are doing what is necessary at the moment," Harper told reporters.</p>
<p>"We obviously recommend to the population to follow any warnings or advisories that are being given by various health authorities, whether they be federal, provincial or international," he said.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, also sought to assure Canadians that should the spread of swine flu be declared a pandemic, Canada is among the most prepared countries in the world.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is one step away from calling the outbreaks, now confirmed in at least 11 countries and suspected to be in many more, a pandemic.</p>
<p>It raised its alert level on Wednesday to Phase 5 on a six-phase scale. The change was meant to signal that a pandemic is probably imminent and countries should activate their preparedness plans.</p>
<p>The increased alert level does not necessarily mean an elevated risk to Canadians, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"Still, there are concrete actions we are taking to ramp up our response and to prepare for the next phase," he said.</p>
<p>Canadians will start seeing notices from the Public Health Agency of Canada in their newspapers as part of the awareness campaign, advising readers on how to avoid infection. As the number of cases escalates, so will the intensity of the campaign.</p>
<p>The Public Health Department also announced it will refer to the current swine flu as the "H1N1 flu virus" to make it clear that the virus is not being spread by pigs, but by humans.</p>
<p>The worldwide total of cases also rose sharply yesterday as test results poured in from laboratories testing for the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>Mexico saw its swine flu caseload jump to 260, and test results from that country are expected to start coming in faster, now that it has its own laboratory capacity. It had been sending samples to Canada and the United States for testing but experts from both countries have been on the ground in Mexico, helping health officials there set up its own infrastructure.</p>
<p>At least 109 cases have been recorded in the U.S.</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. health officials had to do damage control after Vice-President Joe Biden appeared to warn the public against travelling on airplanes and subways to prevent the spread of the illness.</p>
<p>"I think flying is safe. Going on the subway is safe. People should go out and live their lives," said Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centres for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Tour companies have cancelled trips, several countries have issued warnings against non-essential travel to Mexico, and yesterday leaders from the European Union debated, but ultimately rejected, a ban on flights to Mexico.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More flu cases no cause for alarm: Liepert; 'Live life normally,' urges health minister, as calls to public information line double</b>
</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>759 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert urged Albertans to "live life normally," despite the announcement Thursday of four new cases of swine flu in the province.</p>
<p>The new cases were confirmed in three young men and a young woman from Calgary, all of whom had recently returned from holidays together in Mexico's Cancun area.</p>
<p>The cases are all mild and all four people are recovering at home and remaining in isolation for seven days, the maximum incubation period for the virus, health officials say. Two earlier swine flu cases of a boy in northern Alberta and a young adult in Calgary also recovered quickly.</p>
<p>The new cases, along with four more in Nova Scotia, five in B.C. and one each in Ontario and Quebec, bring Canada's total confirmed cases to 34. No one in Canada has died of the disease. None of the Alberta cases required hospitalization.</p>
<p>"Live life normally," Liepert said Thursday. "We've got a plan in place. We have officials working. Things are under control, so anything that goes beyond that is basically hype and rumour."</p>
<p>Liepert advised taking a "business as usual" attitude and said the new cases were no cause for alarm. He said there were no contingency plans in place to prepare for the summer, when crowds and tourists gather at festivals.</p>
<p>"We're talking about six Albertans out of what, 3.5 million Albertans? So it's too early to give any indication that anything would change, but at this stage, there are no plans to do anything differently," Liepert said.</p>
<p>He said Alberta is nothing like Mexico City, the epicentre of the flu outbreak, where soccer stadiums are closed to the public to prevent flu transmission.</p>
<p>"I think our plan is going exceptionally well," Liepert said.</p>
<p>Alberta's Health Link information line has faced double its usual number of phone calls. On Monday, health professionals on the line handled 4,611 calls, compared to an average 2,270.</p>
<p>Another 4,183 called on Tuesday and 3,924 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>To deal with the influx of calls from people seeking flu information, the province is setting up a separate Health Link line, although no details or timeline were available.</p>
<p>Edmonton Public and Edmonton Catholic school systems have cancelled all air travel and international trips for students, something Liepert suggested was premature.</p>
<p>"Take the precautions, but let's not overreact," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said the World Health Organization's decision Wednesday to raise the pandemic threat level to five on a scale of six doesn't change things here.</p>
<p>"If you're driving your car and you hear a siren from an emergency vehicle, if it doesn't concern you, the best thing to do is move aside, let it go by and then continue wherever you were going without worrying about it too much," Corriveau said. "At this point, this is what we're trying to do."</p>
<p>Dr. Marcia Johnson, deputy medical officer of health for Alberta Health Service's Edmonton region, said officials across the province were having meetings almost daily to prepare for a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>"We need to keep preparing for the worst," Johnson said. "We don't know which way this is going to go."</p>
<p>She said most of the planning deals with how to share information quickly. An emergency operation centre is running, with people keeping close tabs on what's happening around the world and in local hospitals, physicians' offices and lab facilities.</p>
<p>While hospitals haven't been clogged with symptomatic people, Johnson said hospital teams are brushing up on, though not implementing, their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>There has been no need to turn to stockpiles of masks for everyone entering the hospital, since all cases have been mild and based in the community.</p>
<p>But managers are discussing human resource plans and the need for equipment should a pandemic arrive, Johnson said.</p>
<p>Edmonton's health region, for instance, has all-weather tents that can be used as triage centres to divert sick people away from emergency rooms.</p>
<p>Previous Journal reports in 2005 also suggested the region had seven railway containers on the outskirts of the city, filled with collapsible hospital beds.</p>
<p>None of that is needed, Johnson said.</p>
<p>"We need to be on alert," Johnson said. "Influenza has to be respected."</p>

</p>
<p>Last week, I wrote about how Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff is trying to find ways to woo women voters, and how maddening it is when male politicians talk about "women's issues" as if women were a mono-lithic bloc. I didn't know at the time that I was writing part 1 on that issue. Part 2 only materialized Thursday when I had a chance to chat with Ruby Dhalla, Liberal MP for Brampton-Springdale.</p>
<p>I remember Dhalla from when she was a little kid in Winnipeg. She was always getting her picture in the newspaper either because she'd walked off with the top prize at the school science fair or because she was, even at that young age, a dedicated community activist. In fact, when I heard that she'd been elected to Parliament back in 2004, I couldn't believe it was the same Ruby Dhalla from Winnipeg. How could she possibly be all grown up already? Then I decided that it would be definitely unfair if time had stood still for Ruby, keeping her forever 12, and I was the only one who had grown older in the interim. Where is the justice in that?</p>
<p>Dhalla was in Calgary this week, on her way to Vancouver for the Liberals' convention, and after we reminisced a bit about Winnipeg, we got down to discussing women in politics--and how far they have yet to go. Take the fashion factor, for example. Dhalla wishes that people would focus on what a woman candidate is saying, not what she's wearing. Observing the recent U. S. presidential campaign was exasperating. "They talked about what types of suits Hillary Clinton was wearing, and about Sarah Palin's hair and glasses. Did anyone ask (Barack) Obama, 'where did you get your shirt?' " Dhalla says. And don't get her started on the Belinda Stronach-Peter MacKay romance: "How relevant is anyone's personal life?" she asks.</p>
<p>Dhalla ran into a variation on this theme herself when someone introduced her at a gathering in Calgary this week with the remark that "it's great that Ruby hasn't lost her femininity."</p>
<p>Imagine introducing Stephen Harper by announcing that it's great that being prime minister hasn't caused him to lose his masculinity.</p>
<p>The trouble is, Dhalla says, the image of a politician is of a "male, 60 to 70 years old, with white hair."</p>
<p>Just such a male--former prime minister Paul Martin--appointed Dhalla to be the Liberal candidate in her riding, and once in Ottawa, she found women have an uphill battle melding the expectations in their personal lives with a career in politics. "On the Hill, no one I know of has young kids. There's no day-care centre there," Dhalla says.</p>
<p>Although past and present MPs like Deborah Grey, Alexa McDonough and Judy Wasylycia-Leis made it to Parliament under their own steam, Dhalla doesn't see anything concessionary about women candidates being appointed. "The process to get the nomination is extremely difficult," she says, mentioning the problem with building financial backing, for one. I disagree. If women want to be treated equally, then they have to run for the nomination like a man and win or lose it fair and square. And if Grey, McDonough, Wasylycia-Leis and other women could do it, so can the younger generation of bright, savvy, female would-be MPs.</p>
<p>Dhalla also feels women bring a more caring perspective to Parliament. "Women have a certain degree of compassion as daughters, sisters and mothers," she says. I'd have to part company with Dhalla on this point, too. An overabundance of caring and compassion can condition a woman to be a self-effacing doormat. The only place for a doormat in Parliament is on the steps leading up to the main entrance. And it would be a mistake to assume that every woman is gifted with a healthy dose of those qualities anyway --we all know women whose compassion quotient is only slightly higher than Attila the Hun's.</p>
<p>Women politicians have to be visible, and while Dhalla applauds Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq for her leadership in the swine flu crisis, she's watched Aglukkaq remain pretty quiet in the Commons until now. "You can't just give women titles; you have to let them participate," Dhalla says.</p>
<p>And when they do participate, please stop obsessing over what they're wearing.</p>
<p>"People take great interest (in what women politicians are wearing). Listen to what comes out of my mouth instead," says Dhalla.</p>
<p>Right on, Ruby! That's really how all women want to be treated, isn't it?</p>

<p>Taiwan's observer status at this month's World Health Assembly is a small but important victory. The self-ruled island deserves a seat on the world stage to represent the interests of its people, who have been forced to accept the deadly mixture of politics and health for too long.</p>
<p>Taiwan has largely been shut out of important global health conversations since China joined the United Nations in 1971 even though Taiwan used to be a member of the UN, and helped found the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Taiwan has lobbied since 1997 to get back into the WHO, without success. It has now won observer status at the UN's World Health Assembly, but only after China dropped its opposition. Without doubt, the invitation is a breakthrough.It's just dampened by the unsettling conditions: - Taiwan must participate under the name Chinese Taipei; a nod to China's right to the disputed territory. - It's a one-time approval. Taiwan must still grovel in future for China's permission to attend other meetings. - The extent of Taiwan's involvement will be determined by China.</p>
<p>Even so, China is demonstrating good will. The real issue is a lack of backbone by the UN and its organizations to simply recognize Taiwan's rightful place at the international table.</p>
<p>Beijing has so much control, it even determines when the flow of crucial health-related information from the WHO reaches Taiwan. That caused trouble during the 2003 SARS outbreak, with China accused of keeping Taiwan in the dark, possibly costing lives. At least now, with the swine flu outbreak, Taiwan has been included in the WHO information sharing-network.</p>
<p>These steps are good. Full membership in the World Health Organization and ultimately the United Nations would be much better. Here's hoping this is a move that will go viral.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Calgary hit by 4 new flu cases; Mild cases reported after group returns from Mexico</b>
</div><div>Michelle Lang   </div>
<div>And Canwest News Service</div>
<div>860 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Four Calgarians who recently travelled to Mexico together are confirmed to have swine flu, health officials said Thursday as they announced a toll-free phone line will be created to handle a flood of calls from concerned Albertans.</p>
<p>Alberta Health said the four "mild" infections are in three young men and one woman who are now recovering at home in Calgary. Theyhad been on vacation in Cancun.</p>
<p>The new cases of the flu --which the World Health Organization is now calling H1N1 -- follow two cases of the disease confirmed in the province earlier this week in a young Calgary man and a boy from northern Alberta.</p>
<p>The province's chief medical officer said more cases are Kids taught prevention likely, including in people who haven't been to Mexico.</p>
<p>"We certainly expect to see more cases," said Dr. Andre Corriveau. "There are still people who returned from Mexico recently. It wouldn't be a surprise if some of the contacts could turn out positive."</p>
<p>The comments come as Canada announced 15 new cases of the influenza virus Thursday -- the four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario, five in British Columbia and one in Quebec. A confirmed case in a Vernon, B. C., student led officials to close Beairsto Elementary School for the next week.</p>
<p>Canada has reported 34 cases of the disease, all mild, since swine flu was first detected in the country on Sunday. The number of cases world-wide has surpassed 270. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization raised its alert level to phase five, a signal that a pandemic could be imminent and countries should activate their preparedness plans.</p>
<p>In Canada, none of the infections have proved serious, but worried Albertans have been heading to their doctors and flooding a provincial medical helpline--HealthLink-- with questions about the disease.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Corriveau announced Alberta will establish a new phone line staffed by professionals who can answer questions about swine flu, saying this will help"unclog"the large volume of calls to HealthLink.</p>
<p>"HealthLink (staff) are expert resources for people who are actually sick," said Corriveau. "If you are just looking for more information, there should shortly be a separate line available."</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services, the agency that is setting up the toll-free line, did not have any details on when the service would be available.</p>
<p>Despite concerns about the virus, Corriveau and Health Minister Ron Liepert said the risk to the average Albertan remains low and noted all the Canadian illnesses from the virus have been mild.</p>
<p>"Live your life normal," said Liepert. "We are talking about six Albertans out of . . . three and a half million Albertans."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some Calgary doctors offices said they are facing a two-day delay from Alberta's provincial lab for distribution of a specialized nasal swab. Physicians have been instructed to use the swabs to test patients with suspected cases of the virus.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said the lab is not facing a shortage of the swabs, adding production of the swabs is ongoing.</p>
<p>"We will have thousands on hand by Friday,"said spokesman Don Stew-art. "The lab is working to ensure there is a healthy stockpile."</p>
<p>In Ottawa, the Public Health Agency of Canada also announced it will now call the swine flu virus"H1N1 flu"after the World Health Organization made a similar statement Thursday.</p>
<p>"From this time, we will be referring to this virus as the H1N1 virus to make it clear this is not spread from pigs, or pork products,"said Dr.David Butler-Jones of the agency.</p>
<p>The pork industry, which has been lobbying for governments to change the virus's name, welcomed the move. A handful of countries has banned pork products from Canada, the U. S. and Mexico in light of the outbreak, even though experts say the virus can't be transmitted from the meat.</p>
<p>The new designation "puts (the virus) in the proper perspective, and that's what we need to have," said Paul Hodgman, executive director of Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council spokesman Gary Stordy said the change will hopefully reassure people that pork is safe to eat.George Groeneveld, Alberta's agriculture minister, applauded the move to go with a name that doesn't unfairly malign pork producers.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Developments - Alberta announces four new cases, all in Calgary; - Canada announces 15 new infections Thursday; - Alberta Health working to establish a phone line to answer questions on virus; - World Health Organization and Public Health Agency of Canada begin calling the virus H1N1 instead of swine flu to clarify it is not spread from pigs or pork products.</p>

<p>As the number of confirmed cases of swine flu rises world-wide, schools in southern Alberta are taking their own precautions.</p>
<p>As has been the case in recent years, students are being reminded about personal hygiene and urged to wash their hands and cough into their sleeves.</p>
<p>For parent Laura Brubacher, handwashing has been a part of the routine for her children ever since avian flu hit the news in 2006.</p>
<p>Because of that hygiene regime, Brubacher said she doesn't have any concerns about swine flu, noting lots of people get sick from regular flu every year and that health care in Canada is very good.</p>
<p>"I worry more about them bumping their heads or getting a really bad scratch," Brubacher said of her three children who attend Sunnyside School.</p>
<p>School authorities in Calgary have posted information on their websites about swine flu, which health authorities are now referring to as the "H1N1 flu virus" to make clear that the virus is not being spread by pigs, but by humans.</p>
<p>The Calgary Catholic School District sent out ane-mail on Monday to principals, giving them the option to send home information to parents if they thought it was necessary, spokeswoman Janet Sutherland said.</p>
<p>Another notice was sent to principals Thursday and includes a series of questions and answers about swine flu provided by Alberta Health Services. That information will be posted on schools' websites or sent home to parents on Friday.</p>
<p>The Calgary Board of Education also sent a notice to principals on Monday, allowing them to decide how to relay the information to parents, spokeswoman Joanne Ramondt said.</p>
<p>In some cases, a letter was sent home, in others, it was posted on the school's web-site or could be included in a newsletter.</p>
<p>Michael Barbero, a superintendent with the Catholic school district, said a lot was learned about how to prevent the spread of illness from the SARS outbreak in Toronto and from avian flu in 2006.</p>
<p>Bar soap was replaced with dispensers in school bathrooms and hand sanitizers are also provided. Educating students on good hygiene was one of the major lessons learned --something that is applied today over swine flu worries, Barbero said.</p>
<p>"We're not in the business of scaring people," Barbero said.</p>
<p>"But we believe that people need to begin educating themselves about the issue and learning how to reduce the risk of infection."</p>
<p>Barbero said Alberta Health Services would take the lead if a student at a Catholic district school contracts swine flu.</p>
<p>That student would have to stay home. Health and school authorities would find out which class the student was in, and who had been in contact with the child, Barbero said. The classroom would be monitored for any other ill students. Measures could include disinfecting anything in the school--such as doorknobs --that students touch.</p>
<p>That's what happened about three or four years ago at an elementary school in Medicine Hat School District No. 76. The cleaning was prompted after a number of students contracted Norovirus, recalls superintendent Linda Rossler.</p>
<p>"We had four or five students that were out and the health officer advised us, and we went in and cleaned the schools," she said.</p>
<p>Barbero said Alberta Health Services are called in any time more than 10 per cent of students at a school are ill.</p>
<p>"We then walk into that building with Alberta Health Services and say, 'OK, what's going on in this building? Why have we got a high percentage of illnesses in the school?' " he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Not as deadly as flu season, but virus takes toll on the economy</b>
</div><div>Harvey Enchin   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>631 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>At the same time as the World Health Organization ramps up its alerts on the swine flu outbreak, researchers are saying it won't be as deadly as the average flu season. That's not to say it's not serious. Influenza is an enormous public health problem whether or not the WHO assigns it a number.</p>
<p>Each year, influenza results in an average of 20,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The federal government estimates that a pandemic of moderate severity, in the absence of vaccines or antivirals, would cause 11,000 to 58,000 deaths and 34,000 to 138,000 hospitalizations. There could be two million to five million outpatients and as many as 10.6 million clinically ill without formal care. But economists don't concern themselves with human misery and suffering; they just want to know how much all this is going to cost.</p>
<p>Ottawa's tally under the scenario described above is $330 million to $1.4 billion in additional health care expenses and $5 billion to $38 billion in societal costs through lost productivity.</p>
<p>Of course, the economic impact of a flu outbreak, or the spreading of any infectious disease, is increased by our response to it. For instance, more than half a dozen countries have banned swine or pork exports from Canada, including Japan, which bought $712.6 million US worth of pork from Canada last year, representing 31.3 per cent of total pork exports. Nearly two dozen countries have erected what amounts to non-tariff trade barriers in hogs and related products from North America. The measure is obviously irrational and will serve only to throw sand in the gears of global commerce.</p>
<p>Worse is to come. U.S. President Barack Obama said this week that educational authorities with confirmed cases of swine flu should consider closing schools. Imagine the ripple effects. Working parents would have to stay home to look after their children and the rise in absenteeism would deal a severe blow to the North American economy, already reeling from the recession.</p>
<p>Hardest hit, of course, is Mexico, where the disease is believed to have originated and which has closed all restaurants, bars, clubs and other public venues in the capital city in an effort to stem its spread. The jobs of nearly half a million hospitality workers are in jeopardy. Hundreds of flights to Mexico have been cancelled as tourists avoid the destination. The Mexican government estimates economic growth could drop by 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of GDP, or as much as $70 billion, due to the outbreak.</p>
<p>Most of what we know about the potential economic impact of an influenza pandemic comes from research by Martin Meltzer and his associates at the National Center for Infectious Diseases in Atlanta. Studies they published in 1999 estimated that the cost of an outbreak in the U.S. would range from $71.3 billion to $166.5 billion, of which approximately 80 per cent would be due to loss of life.</p>
<p>But World Bank economist Milan Brahmbhatt said the experience with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which spread to 28 countries in five months in 2003, suggests the most immediate economic impacts come as a result of uncoordinated efforts by individuals to avoid infection, creating severe demand shock for tourism, mass transit, retail sales, hotels and restaurants and others in the service sector, as well as supply shock through increased workplace absenteeism.</p>
<p>If there's anything good to be said about the current recession, it's that we don't have as far to fall.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu and the stock market; What's bad for some is a boost for others</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Chevreau   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>616 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>E8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The growing media coverage of swine flu comes at an inconvenient time for the shaky stock market. With the first death in the United States reported this week, we're even starting to see the word "pandemic" used in news reports, though I'm not at all sure it's appropriate at this juncture.</p>
<p>As part of the media, I tend to be skeptical about knee-jerk reactions to whatever is the crisis of the day. As a stock investor, my natural tendency to buy-and-hold for the long run also makes me reluctant to respond to such "noise."</p>
<p>Indeed, in his Inner Circle bulletins and subsequently on Twitter, investment counsellor Patrick McKeough reassured his flock with these words: " I doubt that swine flu poses an investment risk. Health authorities are just erring on the side of caution."</p>
<p>The new CanadianMoneyForum.com has an ongoing discussion entitled Swine Flu Effects on the Market. There's no question that individual stocks and sectors can be impacted in the short term: the initial market reaction was to cause aviation stocks to fall (not good for travel) but for pharmaceutical stocks to rise, especially those that make flu vaccines(such as <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.) <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span> makes the Purell hand cleaner. Swine stocks fell initially and one would expect that publicly traded makers of white masks would rise, such as 3M, which is reputed to make the best N95 respiratory mask.</p>
<p>Canadian investors may feel they've seen this movie before with the SARS virus in 2003. But most investors would agree SARS was somewhat overblown. The two are not the same. SARS was largely a hospital-acquired infection and never really spread to the population at large. Swine flu is a travel-related infection.</p>
<p>Of course, the media had a field day with SARS and, here in 2009, swine flu and those photos of Mexicans in masks are certainly minute-by-minute fodder for blogs and the incessant torrent of information that passes through social networking sites like Twitter and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p>It's possible the intense coverage will amplify what otherwise would have been a minor impact on the market, but the strong performance of the market this week -- it closed basically flat yesterday -- seems to vindicate the "don't worry, be happy" crowd.</p>
<p>Some wily investment contrarians are even considering investing in the casualties of swine flu, such as Mexican airport operator, Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sure (ASR.) In his Stingy Investor newsletter, value-oriented stock-picker Norman Rothery points out the Spanish flu of 1918 had little impact on the S&P500 index.</p>
<p>All in all, I see no reason to factor swine flu into any investment action. Over the long run, this is likely to be a blip.</p>
<p>If you're broadly invested in the market, perhaps through index funds, then I'd expect the gains in certain sectors to be offset by losses in others with no real net impact.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean all the other things stock market investors worry about don't still need to be considered. Contagion is an ongoing concern but I'm not talking about swine flu. Rather I'm referring to the ongoing credit crisis and a book entitled Contagion, written by John Talbott, who predicted the housing crash in another book. It talks about the "financial epidemic that is sweeping the global economy."</p>
<p>Now that's scary.</p>

the swine flu has had a mixed impact on the markets.

<p>Prices - Crude oil rose, heading for a third monthly gain, on speculation that the global economy and fuel demand will recover this year.</p>
<p>Oil advanced as stock markets strengthened on better-than-expected earnings and speculation the worst of the global recession is over. Industrial output in Japan increased for the first time in six months, while U. K. consumer confidence climbed to the highest level in a year. Prices fell earlier on concern the spread of swine flu may cut fuel demand.</p>
<p>Crude oil for June delivery rose 20 cents, or 0.4 per cent, to $51.17 US a barrel on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>. Prices have gained three per cent this month.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Credit goes to Harper for Grit revival</b>
</div><div>Don Martin   </div>

</p>
<p>Just in case those giddy Liberals need a reason to drink, they should raise a glass at the party convention this weekend to the founder of their serendipitous self-celebration: Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>Without the prime minister's provocative intervention last fall to eliminate all public funding for political parties, the opposition's dead-on-arrival coalition would not have formed, the ouster of hapless leader Stephane Dion would not have been accelerated and Michael Ignatieff's rivals would not have abandoned their leadership bids.</p>
<p>Thanks to Harper's unfortunate move, the division and acrimony of a hotly-contested leadership race this weekend will be replaced by Liberals singing a Hallelujah Chorus of harmony in Lotusland as they crown Ignatieff their new king and his MPs start dreaming of their preferred cabinet gigs.</p>
<p>So spooked are the Conservatives at this Liberal resurgence, there's talk of negotiating a pact with the New Democrats or Bloc Quebecois (or both) to keep the government in power until they can bask in the gold-medal after-glow of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver next February.</p>
<p>Does this ring a coalition bell to anyone? Is there any difference between this arranged marriage and the ill-fated, Liberal-led trio of government-toppling parties that a furious Harper denounced as "a betrayal of the voters of this country, a betrayal of the best interests of our economy and a betrayal of the best interests of our country"?</p>
<p>Perhaps it's slightly more legitimate as a Conservative minority scrambling to find partners to govern, as opposed to an opposition plot to seize and share power, but it still paints the prime minister as a double-standard schemer who clings to power at any cost to his principles.</p>
<p>But back to the Liberals, a party enjoying a remarkable convergence of favourable scenarios just six months after their electoral collapse to just 77 seats under Dion.</p>
<p>When Ignatieff claims the leadership uncontested on Saturday, he'll be the anti-Harper in leadership style -- a good listener who relishes contact with people, enjoys media exposure, possesses a sense of humour and has a new book out that reads like a long campaign pamphlet extolling his vision as a Canadian newly returned from three decades of globe-trotting.</p>
<p>He's basking in don't-pinch-me-I'm-dreaming voter approval, the latest being a CROP poll putting the party ahead of the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, something that hasn't happened since Paul Martin's leadership was in its brief honeymoon phase.</p>
<p>And Ignatieff has brought adult supervision to party backrooms while firing up fundraising and hammering together preliminary policy for an election the party thinks may come in the fall, but expects for sure in the spring.</p>
<p>They probably shouldn't catch snap election fever. An unusual dichotomy is taking place that spans all Canadian political parties. All four leaders need more time to get ready before fighting a campaign.</p>
<p>The Conservatives need the recession to ease and any swine flu pandemic to dissipate before they head for the polls, but not before unleashing the mother of all smear campaigns against Ignatieff as a landed immigrant filled with waffling opinions.</p>
<p>The Liberals need another year to rebuild their empty war chest and recruit star candidates.</p>
<p>The New Democrats are struggling to prevent their annihilation under a Liberal rebound. They find themselves in an ugly squeeze -- cursed if they support the government, damned if they side with the Liberals.</p>
<p>Canadians don't want their government mothballed for the election writ period when the twin horrors of an economic and health care crisis are still spiralling into the ugly unknown.</p>
<p>If the Liberals don't define Ignatieff as prime ministerial material quickly, the Conservatives will take their shot at painting him as a worthy leader -- for the Official Opposition.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama's hyperactive 100 days</b>
</div><div>The Economist</div>
<div>1026 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>On Monday, a large passenger jet flew low over Manhattan, closely pursued by a fighter aircraft. Unsurprisingly, New Yorkers panicked. Few were amused to discover later that the plane was Air Force One, and that the White House had ordered it to buzz the Statue of Liberty for a publicity photo.</p>
<p>For Barack Obama's detractors, the incident perfectly captured the new president's penchant for style over substance. "Wouldn't Photoshop have been cheaper?" asked a conservative blogger.</p>
<p>After 100 days in office, Obama is still scorned by the people who scorned him as a candidate. But they are a minority.</p>
<p>A YouGov/Polimetrix poll for The Economist found that fully 70 per cent of Americans like Obama as a person. Many are struck by his intelligence and wholesome family, complete with new dog. Few can see in him any personal vices worse than the occasional cigarette.</p>
<p>Obama scores less well as a president than as a person, but not much. YouGov found that 60 per cent of Americans like the way he is handling the job. Other pollsters put the number even higher.</p>
<p>In general, Obama is much more popular than Congress and slightly more popular than the policies he espouses. So long as this lasts, he is in a strong position to cajole Congress into approving his agenda.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, his position grew even stronger. Arlen Specter, a Republican senator from Pennsylvania, announced that he would defect to the Democrats.</p>
<p>If the Democrats also win a disputed seat in Minnesota, as seems likely, Specter's defection would give them a 60-vote super-majority in the Senate. This would make it much easier for Obama to pass his two big domestic proposals: heath-care reform and a cap-and-trade system for curbing carbon emissions.</p>
<p>However, Specter said he would continue to oppose a bill that would let unions dispense with secret-ballot elections.</p>
<p>Obama is both cursed and blessed to have taken over in the middle of a blazing financial crisis. Cursed, because he has had to spend his first 100 days frenziedly firefighting. Blessed, because no one blames him.</p>
<p>Even as joblessness soars and Americans' savings turn to cinders, Obama wins plaudits for acting boldly to douse the flames. He has enacted a huge fiscal stimulus, unveiled a hyper-Keynesian budget, propped up tottering car firms and hastily drafted new rules for how financial bailouts will proceed.</p>
<p>No one knows if Obama's fiscal fire hose will work. The economy shrank at an annualized rate of 6.1 per cent in the first three months of this year, as businesses slashed inventories and cut investment by a shocking 38 per cent.</p>
<p>This makes the current recession at least as bad as any since the Second World War. And it is unlikely to end soon: the commercial property market is groaning and swine flu is sure to cause jitters.</p>
<p>Republicans protest that since the money Obama is spraying about is borrowed, he is dooming the nation to higher taxes in the future. On April 15, the day by which Americans must file their taxes, hundreds of thousands held "tea party" protests against Obama's plan to double the deficit.</p>
<p>But overall, Americans are much more optimistic about the economy since Obama took over.</p>
<p>Most do not mind if he increases the size of government to tackle the crisis, so long as he scales it back when it is over.</p>
<p>Strikingly, 45 per cent of Americans now think the country is on the right track, up from a miserable 15 per cent before Obama was elected. The stock market, too, is up by a quarter since its low point on March 9.</p>
<p>Obama has been able to keep some of his campaign promises without congressional say-so, simply by signing executive orders.</p>
<p>In January, he ordered the closure within a year of the prison for terrorist suspects at Guantanamo Bay. This delighted his supporters, but he has not yet decided what to do with the detainees, and has not ruled out detaining some of them indefinitely.</p>
<p>In March, he gave an order to lift George W. Bush's restrictions on federal funding for stem-cell research, while delegating the task of drafting more detailed ethical rules to the National Institutes of Health. And in April, he lifted some restrictions on Cuban-Americans travelling and sending money to Cuba.</p>
<p>Abroad, Obama has won applause. He was received warmly during a visit to Europe, where audiences appreciated his promise to show more respect for world opinion than his predecessor did. Republicans berate him for exuding weakness, noting that his big speech on nuclear disarmament was upstaged by a North Korean missile test.</p>
<p>Democrats retort that Obama can be tough when necessary. He has fired missiles into Pakistan to kill suspected Taliban fighters hiding there. And he is ramping up the war in Afghanistan even as he withdraws troops from Iraq.</p>
<p>Republicans snipe that however much foreigners may like Obama, they are still not prepared to send many troops to help America in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Some of Obama's biggest headaches are being aggravated by his own party. He has banned "waterboarding," a form of torture that was used on at least three al-Qaeda members thought to have information about impending attacks. But he is resisting his supporters' demands that Bush-era officials be prosecuted for authorizing such methods of interrogation.</p>
<p>His reluctance may stem from the knowledge that his own party is also complicit. For example, Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House, was briefed about waterboarding and raised no objections. Plus, he has bigger priorities. He is trying to save what is salvageable of the American car industry. He wants to reshape the American health-care system, which is nearly a fifth of the economy. He wants to tackle climate change, but has not yet begun to explain to voters that this will raise their energy bills.</p>
<p>His honeymoon will not last forever. If he is to build on the promise of his first 100 days, he must spend his political capital cautiously.</p>

<p>Re: "Too little, too late," Editorial, April 28.</p>
<p>I strongly reject that Mexico's authorities would have hidden any information about a single swine flu case.</p>
<p>Since the first cases were registered, health authorities from Veracruz state not only conducted their own biological tests, but around 20 samples were sent without delay to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Only one sample--from a young boy--that had been determined as a case of parainfluenza also tested positive for swine flu.</p>
<p>It was on April 23 that, based on these first samples, Mexico's health authorities detected the new virus and immediately established the epidemic alert.</p>
<p>It is pointless and disparaging to try to blame a country for the dissemination of a virus. Two cases had been previously reported in California and Texas.</p>
<p>International protocols and recommendations from the World Health Organization were followed, and preventive measures continue to be implemented.</p>
<p>National institutions and state health systems throughout Mexico, including private medical services, took great pains not only to deal with cases, but to collect, document, organize and immediately inform the Secretariat of Health of all possible cases of swine flu, in the utmost detail, and paying particular concern to the symptomatology presented by patients.</p>

</p>
<p>Pierre Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act in 1970 to battle radical Quebec separatists. Would Prime Minister Stephen Harper invoke its successor legislation to combat the flu?</p>
<p>Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, which killed 44 Canadians and cost the economy an estimated $1.5 billion, public health officials have been refining a national plan to protect Canadians against a flu pandemic. The result is a 550-page document that lays out the roles and responsibilities of federal, provincial and municipal governments and their health-care authorities.</p>
<p>But like any plan, the pandemic blueprint is only an outline.</p>
<p>Depending on a range of factors, including the nature and severity of the flu strain sweeping the globe, Canada's public health officials and political leaders will have to make a number of tough decisions that would not only put their careers on the line, but also the lives of Canadians.</p>
<p>"We have a comprehensive plan, and it's extremely detailed, and we're much better off for having a plan in place, but these things never go smoothly,"said Dr.Kumanan Wilson, Canada research chair in health policy at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>Although the SARS outbreak intensified the planning efforts, the federal government has been preparing for a pandemic since 1983.A first draft was created in 1988, and federal officials update the plan every few years.</p>
<p>Canada has revised its pandemic alert system to closely mirror that of the World Health Organization, which ranks outbreaks on a scale of one to six. But even if WHO raises its alert to six, signifying a global pandemic, it's not clear all jurisdictions in Canada will operate in "pandemic" mode.</p>
<p>Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, for example, will watch closely to see if the City of Toronto officially declares that the city has entered a pandemic phase, said Dr. Allison McGeer, the hospital's director of infection control.</p>
<p>"If this turns into a pandemic, the waves are going to be in different places at different times," said Mc-Geer. "Across the full geography of Canada, there may be as much as six or eight weeks' difference between the peaks."</p>
<p>If Canada declares it has entered a pandemic phase, there are certain things to expect.</p>
<p>Canadian researchers are already involved in the global effort to develop a swine-flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Having declared a national pandemic, the government will have to decide whether to implement a mass vaccination program. They would also have to decide who gets the vaccine first, a decision officials are likely already weighing by reviewing the plan's list of "priority" groups, such as front-line doctors and nurses, and individuals most at risk of falling ill.</p>
<p>While the race to produce a vaccine continued, the provinces and territories would likely begin distributing Canada's stockpile of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada, the lead federal agency in a pandemic, would start calling up extra health-care workers and volunteers from organizations such as the Red Cross.</p>
<p>Given that officials estimate between 10,000 and 58,000 deaths in a "mild" pandemic, provinces and municipalities would be tasked with ensuring morgues and cemeteries have enough capacity.</p>
<p>If the situation becomes dire, it's possible the prime minister or Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will recommend Canadians stay home, as President Felipe Calderon asked Mexicans to do Thursday.</p>
<p>The federal government could also make recommendations to cancel public gatherings such as concerts and parades, or to close schools.</p>

</div><div>Gwendolyn Richards   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>492 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Growing concerns over swine flu should serve as a wake-up call to businesses, says a human resources expert who believes companies need to ensure they have emergency plans.</p>
<p>Even though there has only been a small number of cases of swine flu --now being called H1N1--identified, businesses should see this as one more reason to develop plans that respond to pandemics or other emergencies, such as fires, floods or events like the massive blackout in 2003.</p>
<p>"It's a reminder to them that businesses have to plan to succeed. When crises happen, you have to plan to survive," said Michael Luxton, a senior associate with Cenera who helps create such plans for companies.</p>
<p>To be fully prepared, companies should have an emergency response plan that deals with the incident itself-- such as a fire or power outage -- and a continuity plan that outlines how a business will deal with the aftermath of the emergency, Luxton said.</p>
<p>In cases of pandemics, the concern revolves around human resources, as in, staff worried about their safety, will they be available to work and will there be customers.</p>
<p>In the wake of SARS, many businesses were forced to close because revenue stopped coming in but bills still had to be paid, Luxton said.</p>
<p>A good plan can help businesses work through similar situations.</p>
<p>Luxton said at this stage there is no reason to panic, but now is a good time for companies to start working toward building a plan, rather than waiting for an emergent incident to force them to.</p>
<p>From a revenue perspective, companies should make sure they have plans to slow down expenses and costs to preserve cash funds if necessary, Luxton said.</p>
<p>But plans should also address how to ensure staff feel safe coming in and answer their questions around whether they should stay home if they feel ill and if their job will be held if that is the case.</p>
<p>Calgary Economic Development officials hope companies dusting off continuity plans will take a closer look at telework as part of the response to incidents like swine flu.</p>
<p>Through telework, employees can work remotely, either from a home office, a partner site or even a coffee shop, said telework project manager Robyn Bews, adding such a program can answer the question,"What hap-pens if a large percentage of employees are unable to come to work?"</p>
<p>"We see that organizations that have existing telework plans are in good shape in keeping the lights on and supporting customers," Bews said, adding these organizations understand that employees don't have to go to work to be at work.</p>
<p>The CED is launching a program on May 21 about telework. Part of that will be busting some myths, including the belief that if employees can't be seen, it's likely they're not working hard, Bews said.</p>

</p>
<p>Rust beats fatigue. Barely. Not everybody can lose, but a determined Chicago Blackhawk team resorted to drastic measures Thursday and surrendered a 4-on-1 rush late in the third period, forcing the Vancouver Canucks to win 5-3 in the first game of the National Hockey League's second playoff round.</p>
<p>For the Canucks, who thought they'd done enough to lose when they spilled a three-goal lead earlier in the third period, the prettiest thing about the win was, well, the win.</p>
<p>The mass choir for O Canada was cool and fans got free towels and no one, as far as we know, contracted swine flu. Beyond that, there weren't many shining moments.</p>
<p>Hey, it was a terrific win -- nobody trying to get to the Stanley Cup has ever had a bad one -- but a sloppy performance from both teams.</p>
<p>"Well said," Canuck defenceman Willie Mitchell agreed. "We didn't execute well on our power play. We should have really buried the game with how many opportunities we had. We turned over the puck a lot and they weren't very good, either. I'm sure they're saying the same thing. I expect both teams to learn from it."</p>
<p>"I don't think we even played that well in the first two periods," winger Alex Burrows said, referring to the Canucks' "good" ones. "We were up 3-0, but still, we're a much better team. They probably didn't have their best game. Same for us. This sets the table, now we're ready to go next game. We're just happy we got it done.</p>
<p>"But we can be a much better team -- better in the backcheck, better defensive-zone coverage and generate more offensively. As long as we got the first win, that's what we really wanted."</p>
<p>And that's all that mattered Thursday.</p>
<p>But the Canucks will need to be sharper Saturday because the Blackhawks can't help but be.</p>
<p>Chicago, of course, was fresh (or unfresh) from a punishing six-game series against the Calgary Flames, while the Canucks had gone eight days without playing after sweeping the St. Louis Blues.</p>
<p>The Canucks looked stale, the Blackhawks tired.</p>
<p>When Chicago captain and top centre Jonathan Toews plays only 13:46, Patrick Kane scores twice and finishes minus-three, the team's most effective player is Ben Eager, and the winning goal looks like a jail break, it's safe to conclude the Blackhawks were not in peak form.</p>
<p>Chicago's defence is mobile and highly-skilled but not especially physical, which is why Vancouver wants to pound on it whenever it can. The theory, plumbed in the first round by the Flames, is that if you abuse Cam Barker and Brian Campbell and Duncan Keith and Niklas Hjalmarsson often enough, they could become more hesitant than Canuck Pavol Demitra to go into the corners.</p>
<p>But the Canucks didn't have to win that territory because the Blackhawk defence yielded far more valuable space -- the slot. Ryan Kesler and Henrik Sedin scored from the edge of the crease without being touched.</p>
<p>The Blackhawks didn't seem to find their legs until the third period, after coach Joel Quenneville abandoned his usual line combinations.</p>
<p>By then, the Canuck power play was already 1-for-7. Vancouver coped poorly with speed and pressure when Chicago finally generated some, and the Canucks' line of Demitra, Kesler and Mats Sundin was sloppy defensively on both even-strength goals the Blackhawks produced.</p>
<p>But the last mistake lost, and the Blackhawks somehow played themselves into a 4-on-1 Canuck counter-attack when Barker and most of the Chicago roster was caught up ice.</p>
<p>Defenceman Sami Salo could barely believe his eyes when he jumped on the ice and found only Blackhawk Matt Walker and a lot of air between a cavalry of Canucks and the Chicago net. Salo scored on Steve Bernier's rebound to break the 3-3 tie with 73 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>"I was kind of like, what's going on here?" Salo said. "I might as well go. Kyle [Wellwood] told me he was right behind me, so I guess it was a 4-on-1. Both teams were kind of still figuring out what the other is doing. We just have to forget about tonight's game and move on."</p>
<p>Imagine how the Blackhawks feel.</p>
<p>"I think they're going to be better, and we've got to be much better as well," Toews said.</p>
<p>"At times, we had good shifts but we just didn't put it all together."</p>
<p>Neither did the Canucks. But they managed to win despite blowing a 3-0 lead, despite failing to execute on special teams and needing a jackhammer to dislodge the rust of the playoff layoff. All they did was win.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Q and A: Get a flu shot, even if it isn't effective on the new strain; 'It's the best thing you can do right now to decrease your chances of getting the flu,' health official says</b>

</p>
<p>What can I do?</p>
<p>Health officials are advising people to take "personal action" -- cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze, wash hands frequently and stay home if you are sick.</p>
<p>Public places?</p>
<p>If you have health problems, you may want to avoid packed public places, but healthy people shouldn't worry.</p>
<p>"If you are at terrible risk of dying of even a mild respiratory infection, [air travel] is probably a bad thing to do. I think you should avoid public areas in general, not just planes and things. You shouldn't be in a crowded movie theatre or supermarket, either," said Dr. Dalius Briedis, director of clinical infectious diseases at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal.</p>
<p>"If you're a relatively healthy person, I think it's far and away overkill to avoid travelling."</p>
<p>Should I get the flu shot?</p>
<p>This year's seasonal flu shot protects against a human strain of H1N1 influenza, "but we have absolutely no idea of whether it provides any partial or significant protection" against new H1N1 influenza that includes human, swine and avian flu DNA, Briedis says. U.S. officials say its does not.</p>
<p>James Scott of the University of Toronto's School of Public Health says the flu shot is a "hedge bet" against several different flu strains, so is worth getting if you haven't already.</p>
<p>"It's the best thing you can do right now to decrease your chances of getting the flu.</p>
<p>"It's not going to hit this flu. But what you aren't hearing is there are lots of cases of influenza A. This isn't the one and only flu that is in existence right now."</p>
<p>As well, those circulating viruses can swap genes back and forth.</p>
<p>"If you can prevent getting infected with the normal flu, it may decrease the possibility of exchanging, making a new sub-variant" of human swine flu, says University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown.</p>
<p>What about masks?</p>
<p>There are three ways of catching influenza, Briedis says.</p>
<p>"You can have somebody cough gobs of mucus directly in your face. You can touch coughed mucus on an inanimate object -- say, a door knob -- and touch your face and mouth and transmit it that way. Or by breathing in an aerosol," small particles that can hang in the air and also easily move around the edges of a regular surgical mask.</p>
<p>N95 masks, oval-shaped, tightly fitted masks that cover the whole face and nose down to below the chin, filter out these very small droplets.</p>
<p>Surgical masks "will protect you from people who are coughing in your face," Briedis says.</p>
<p>But most influenza is transmitted by the small particles. He says surgical masks will provide no more than 10-to-20-per-cent protection.</p>
<p>"They're more show than substance. People like to feel that they're doing something. It's a psychological boost. In practice, it's not particularly effective."</p>
<p>Tamiflu</p>
<p>Authorities are concerned that anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu could quickly become ineffective and are not recommending it in mild cases. But that hasn't stopped people from rushing to buy it.</p>
<p>According to Scott, "My sense is that Tamiflu's effectiveness is going to be limited to a very narrow window, right at the beginning of the onset of symptoms. If you don't start taking it then, it's not going to be of great help."</p>
<p>Am I sick?</p>
<p>About one to four days usually elapse between the time a person is infected and the onset of symptoms. Influenza normally causes symptoms such as coughing, sneezing, headaches and body aches, fever, chills, and sometimes vomiting and diarrhea. Swine flu causes the same symptoms, and may be difficult to distinguish from other strains of flu and respiratory illnesses. Severe cases of flu that lead to death are normally seen in very young and very old people whose immune systems are too weak to fight off the virus. Adults with severe illness may also have difficulty breathing, dizziness, confusion, or severe vomiting and diarrhea. Children who are breathing abnormally fast or slowly may have respiratory illness. Bluish skin indicates a need for quick attention. Children who are abnormally sluggish and sleepy, irritable, or have fever or rash may also need attention.</p>
<p>Why worry?</p>
<p>When flu viruses mix genes with one another, they can take on new forms. New flu viruses are harder for the human immune system to defend against. With little or no opposition from the immune resistance, the virus can grow quickly and invade many tissues and organs. They may also set off a harmful immune overreaction in the body, called a "cytokine storm," that may be lethal in itself. The swine flu virus from Mexico may have the ability to spread quickly and kill people, possibly causing a worldwide pandemic, according to the WHO.</p>

</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p>World: The World Health Organization said it would remain for now at its current alert level -- one notch below a pandemic. It would no longer refer to the virus as "swine flu" in a nod to beleaguered pork producers, but as influenza A (H1N1).</p>
<p>Death toll: Mexico, 176 (but only seven confirmed so far by genetic testing), U.S. one dead (confirmed by testing).</p>
<p>Illness toll: Just over 270 cases of people falling sick with the new flu have been confirmed worldwide, but thousands of cases are suspected as A/H1N1.</p>
<p>Canada: Ottawa plans to launch a public education campaign today about flu prevention. Canada has 34 confirmed cases, all mild, up from 19 on Wednesday. The first reported school closing, after a student fell ill with a confirmed case, is in Vernon. Nova Scotia reports its first case of a person catching the flu in that province, from someone who had returned from Mexico. Prime Minister Stephen Harper expressed concern at the rise in cases of what he called 'Mexican flu' and called on Canadians to heed the advice of health authorities. Fear of the flu has led to a brisk uptick in business at U.S. and Canadian drug store chains as hand sanitizers and face masks fly off the shelves. Many schools report cancelling school trips to Mexico or the U.S. An Edmonton school district cancelled trips by three school bands to Vancouver.</p>
<p>Japan: Announces its first suspected case, in a teenager who had returned from a trip to B.C.</p>
<p>Mexico: Orders all non-essential businesses and government departments to shut down until May 5 and asks people to remain at home as much as possible. Mexican doctors in surgical masks screened travellers crossing by foot into the U.S.</p>
<p>U.S.: New cases continue to be reported, but the pace appeared to slow slightly. The U.S. has 130 cases confirmed by tests, but more suspected cases. Following federal advice to close schools when a single student falls ill with suspected H1N1, more than 300 schools country-wide were closed, including one in Seattle. All schools in Fort Worth, Tex. are closed for the next few days. Most Americans over age 18 say they aren't concerned about catching swine flu, although almost a third are hedging their bets and washing their hands more often, according to a survey by BIGresearch.</p>
<p>Britain: Announces three more cases for a total of eight; unveils a massive media campaign and mailing of pamphlets to all homes outlining steps people can take to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Conspiracy theories: Dead pigs in China, evil factory farms in Mexico and an al-Qaida plot involving Mexican drug cartels are a few wild theories seeking to explain the flu outbreak that has killed up to 176 people. Nobody knows for sure, but scientists say the origins are far less sinister and likely explained by the ability of viruses to mutate and jump from species to species as animals and people increasingly live closer to each other.</p>

<p>I find it interesting that this latest outbreak of swine flu appears to have a genetic connection to avian flu. It is also interesting that these dangerous cross-species illnesses start where large populations live in close proximity to livestock.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they tend to generate in places that have high population densities where, once established, they can spread very quickly.</p>
<p>Mexico and Asia are not unique. There are many places on Earth where large populations live in high-density environments close to livestock.</p>
<p>Each one is a time bomb waiting to unleash the next lethal pandemic on the world.</p>
<p>We should be thankful not to live in these types of conditions. We should consider our living conditions precious, but do we?</p>
<p>For the last two decades, the mantra from the Vancouver planning department has been to increase the population density within the city dramatically. This is supposed reduce its ecological footprint.</p>
<p>Increased population and increased density cause large crowds to congregate.</p>
<p>Have you ever been on a crammed bus in rush hour and thought, "What if the coughing person standing next to me has avian or swine flu?"</p>
<p>It is unlikely that Vancouver will ever generate one of these deadly cross-species flus, mainly because we don't allow the keeping of livestock in the city.</p>
<p>But wait. Didn't Vancouver recently pass a bylaw allowing city residents to keep chickens? This was supposed to allow us to grow our food closer to home, reducing our dependency on transportation and its consumption of fossil fuels.</p>
<p>I'm not really comfortable with the thought of initiating a deadly viral pandemic simply because it's environmentally friendly. Perhaps now is the time for us to ask ourselves, "What the hell are we doing?"</p>

<p>I am concerned about the amount of media attention the so-called swine flu epidemic is receiving. Millions of people get the flu each year and thousands die of complications from it -- usually, viral pneumonia.</p>
<p>It seems to me that the occurrence of swine flu in Mexico is just another flu event and doesn't warrant the huge amount of media attention it has received.</p>
<p>The public should be informed and our public health authorities should prepare for the worst. However, it is counter-productive to make so much of the situation when it is extremely unlikely that it will develop into a pandemic.</p>

</p>
<p>Scared about swine flu yet? If not, we have more headlines. Like "Government not ready."</p>
<p>Oh sorry, did you miss that one? Too busy looking at that fetching statue of a Mexican lass wearing a mask ... and nothing else. Not sure how that got in the paper. But amid the "we're all gonna die" coverage there is one good reason to think we're all gonna die. Two, actually. But neither is really about swine flu.</p>
<p>As Ottawa doctor and commentator Barry Dworkin observed, to me and his radio audience, coverage of this disease is out of all proportion to its impact. How many new cases of colon cancer were diagnosed last week, he asked me, and how much press did they get? As for Third World havoc, what about malaria or trichinosis? They just don't get much ink because Hollywood celebrities and western journalists tend not to get them.</p>
<p>I don't want to spoil all the fun here. I sympathize with the impulse to panic. Killer epidemics are among my favourite fears, and I realize everyone's ready for a reprise of the dreaded Spanish flu of 1918.</p>
<p>Well, when I say "ready" I mean "not ready." So if you really want to panic I highly recommend a savoury blend of two stories from the front page of Tuesday's Citizen. The lead story had a splendidly terrifying photo of a Mexican in cowl and mask looking uncannily like the man on horse number one. But the text assured us that "Ottawa chief medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, said Monday that the city -- indeed, the country -- is as ready as it could be to face a pandemic. He said 50 million doses of antiviral drugs had been stockpiled, more than enough for every Canadian. The drugs are the first line of defence. Ottawa, he said, would be well protected."</p>
<p>Ordinarily I would have filed this under the Mandy Rice-Davies rule, named for the woman who dismissed an official's denial during Britain's Profumo scandal with the immortal "Well, he would, wouldn't he?"</p>
<p>It is a regrettable feature of modern spin control that when public figures say precisely what you expect them to, regardless of the facts, their words tell you nothing. But look across the page.</p>
<p>Lurking there was a story that "As area hospitals respond to the heightened alert over swine flu, emergency planners are grappling with whether they will have enough nurses and doctors to treat a sudden surge in patients if the deadly outbreak in Mexico triggers a pandemic here. 'It's the million-dollar question because hospitals are at the edge in terms of their capacity already,' said Thomas Hayes, who chairs a committee of emergency planners from area hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care providers."</p>
<p>That bit about hospitals at the edge of their capacity is not what they would say regardless, and tells you everything you really need to know. Our health-care system, in good times, with infectious diseases under control, a healthy, relatively young population and a long period of prosperity, has been brought to its knees by central planning.</p>
<p>No amount of Mandy Rice-Davies style declarations of allegiance to socialized medicine until the last drop of someone else's blood can change this fact.</p>
<p>Nor can a bunch of sanctimonious rhetoric about collective rights from Michael Ignatieff's latest tome change the reality that in health care, as in life generally, it is impossible to know exactly what is going to happen next so you must try to be ready for the unexpected.</p>
<p>Individuals should exercise, eat right and drink plenty of water to give their bodies a fighting chance if they do get sick. And medical systems need to be flexible, responsive, decentralized and operating well below capacity so they can absorb the ferocious blows of a real epidemic without collapsing.</p>
<p>Now look in the mirror. Do you take good care of yourself? You don't have to tell the rest of us but you know the answer.</p>
<p>Now look in the paper. Have politicians taken good care of our health-care system, or only said what you know they would say anyway to protect the well-being of their political careers? Once again you know the answer.</p>
<p>I said at the outset there are two good reasons for thinking we're all gonna die. One is everybody dies, and the goal of keeping fit, ducking when you hear loud noises and seeking appropriate medical care is simply to postpone the event as long as is reasonably possible. The other is that our health-care system is stretched to the breaking point without anything major having gone wrong.</p>
<p>The swine flu is unlikely to be that thing though you never do know. Sooner or later something really bad will happen, and smooth official assurances that everything is under control will be the predictable, useless accompaniment to man-made catastrophe.</p>
<p>There. Now you can panic.</p>

</p>
<p>In case you haven't noticed, there's a pandemic going on -- of speculative, hysterical, ratings-driven journalism.</p>
<p>Of course, we can't ignore the swine flu -- it is a legitimate, worrying story. But do we need the wall-to-wall television coverage with the special logos, contrived local angles in every paper, repetitive interviews with medical personnel trying vainly to keep things in perspective?</p>
<p>"All of humanity is under threat," one television host coolly reports, citing an authoritative source. Yes and no, medical experts hedge, as they walk a careful line between cranking up panic and discounting what is, after all, a serious illness.</p>
<p>If only the media used similar restraint. As the experts deliberately choose their words, we see endless, looping footage of masked health care workers, syringes, worried Mexicans in dusty towns. How many times do we have to be told to wash our hands, cough into our sleeves, stay home if we feel sick and postpone that trip to Mexico? Are inflammatory comparisons to the Spanish influenza epidemic relevant?</p>
<p>Nor does it help when school boards and municipal authorities casually fan the fear -- and protect their own backsides -- by cancelling innocuous school trips, warning people away from cinemas and restaurants, or distributing scary-looking, mostly useless, masks.</p>
<p>All this because of a nasty respiratory illness that, so far, has not killed anyone in this country -- and whose mostly Mexican victims did not, as far as we know, have access to prompt care, or appropriate medication. Such contagions are not caused by poverty, but they flourish in areas where general sanitation, farming methods and access to doctors are wanting -- an important qualifier, often overlooked in the avid reporting.</p>
<p>The news is expected to get worse as more cases are reported -- although the full scope of the epidemic is hard to determine, since only wealthier countries have the capacity to track the disease. But the pandemic could just as likely peak, then recede -- causing nowhere near the 36,000 annual deaths in the United States during a regular seasonal flu.</p>
<p>If the media have failed to find the middle ground, there is praise for the work of Canada's new public health agency and provincial counterparts, who appear to have learned valuable lessons from the SARS crisis. Information is being shared among provinces and with the public, at low-key daily briefings led by chief public health officer David Butler-Jones and federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>Indeed, the crisis has reminded us that we have a federal health minister. Since her appointment in October, Aglukkaq -- a rookie MP and former health minister in Nunavut -- has been all but invisible. Friends say she has been quietly mastering a complex portfolio; critics say Prime Minister Stephen Harper doesn't take the job seriously.</p>
<p>In fact, health care, as an issue, has vanished from the federal scene. Almost everyone behaves as if the problems are solved, as if waiting rooms aren't as crowded as ever, as if millions of Canadians aren't without family doctors, as if those long waits for cancer treatment, or knee replacements, or MRIs, have vanished overnight.</p>
<p>That is what is alarming -- the complacency, inattention, or despair that has left our crippled medicare system to drift. Why have the billions poured into health care by previous governments delivered so little noticeable improvement?</p>
<p>In fact, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty is in trouble this week for closing emergency rooms, transferring staff and "consolidating" services -- leaving some southern Ontario communities who are losing their ERs justifiably outraged.</p>
<p>Even the "good" news is qualified. The Canadian Institute for Health Information reported recently that in eight of 10 provinces, 79 per cent of cancer patients now get treatment in 28 days. For heart bypass surgery, the wait is a mere 26 weeks in seven of 10 provinces. The news on knee replacements is worse. Yet this is supposed to represent progress -- if you live in the right province and in a major city.</p>
<p>Anecdotal evidence is even more damning. Too many elderly patients in hospital beds, which leads to log-jams in emergency; increasing outbreaks of in-hospital infections, thanks to deteriorating standards of cleanliness; mixed-up prescriptions, misinterpreted tests; stone-age record-keeping, rigid divisions of roles, horrendous inefficiencies.</p>
<p>Harper Conservatives, of course, see health care primarily as a provincial responsibility, Liberals aren't much better: at their Vancouver convention this weekend, not one of 12 policy workshops is devoted to health care.</p>
<p>It's not that we need to re-open sterile debates over private-versus-public, or rekindle old federal-provincial power struggles. But if only the sorry state of health care would generate the same obsessive media interest, the same political attention, as the swine flu. It's not as titillating a story, but a greater threat to public health.</p>

<p>A U.S. Department of Energy employee who was part of President Barack Obama's delegation for his recent trip to Mexico came down with flu-like symptoms, and subsequently infected three family members with probable cases of swine flu, the White House said Thursday.</p>
<p>Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesman, said the man never flew on Air Force One and has since recovered and returned to work.</p>
<p>But revelations of the case struck close to home for a president and an administration that has urged vigilance among Americans to protect themselves from potential exposure to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The U.S. administration official in question was a member of the lead security detail for U.S. Energy Secretary Steven Chu during Obama's visit to Mexico City on April 16 and 17.</p>
<p>According to Gibbs, the man arrived in Mexico on April 13 and began to feel ill on April 16. He developed a fever the next day and then returned to the U.S. aboard a commercial airline April 18. He attended a working dinner in Mexico that Obama attended, but never "came within six feet" of the president, Gibbs said.</p>
<p>After the Energy Department employee arrived back in the U.S., he is believed to have infected his wife, young son and a nephew. The mother and son tested "probable" for swine flu on April 28, but "all four individuals experienced only mild symptoms, and all four have recovered," said Gibbs.</p>

<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>797 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden is in trouble for unnerving the public by saying he wouldn't travel in planes or subways now because of swine flu. However, a Canadian expert on the airborne movement of germs says Biden has a point.</p>
<p>"He's right, but I'm not sure it's the role of the politician to necessarily say anything that makes people panic in this," says Dr. James Scott, a professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.</p>
<p>"If you're sitting adjacent or in proximity to someone who is shedding virus in that enclosed indoor environment, the potential to be exposed to stuff is much greater than it is outdoors."</p>
<p>If he were to do what Biden advises against and get on a plane, "I would probably take some surgical masks with me," Scott says. "I don't think there's any reason not to. Even if it gives me only five per cent less likelihood of having the virus, it's not that uncomfortable."</p>
<p>Health officials are advising people to take "personal action" -- cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze, wash hands frequently and stay home if you are sick.</p>
<p>Still, should people get flu shots, or wear face masks? Is air travel safe?</p>
<p>"If you are at terrible risk of dying of even a mild respiratory infection, (air travel) is probably a bad thing to do," says Dr. Dalius Briedis, director of clinical infectious diseases at the Royal Victoria Hospital and a researcher in the department of microbiology at McGill University. "I think you should avoid public areas in general, not just planes and things. You shouldn't be in a crowded movie theatre or supermarket, either.</p>
<p>"If you're a relatively healthy person, I think it's far and away overkill to avoid travelling."</p>
<p>This year's flu shot protects against the human strain of H1N1 influenza, "but we have absolutely no idea of whether it provides any partial or significant protection" against human swine H1N1 influenza, Briedis says.</p>
<p>Scott says the flu shot is a "hedge bet" against several different flu strains. "It's the best thing you can do right now to decrease your chances of getting the flu. It's not going to hit this flu. But what you aren't hearing is there are lots of cases of influenza A. This isn't the one and only flu that is in existence right now."</p>
<p>As well, those circulating viruses can swap genes back and forth. "If you can prevent getting infected with the normal flu, it may decrease the possibility of exchanging, making a new sub-variant" of human swine flu, University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown says.</p>
<p>Influenza affects millions of Canadians each year, resulting in 20,000 admissions to hospital, on average, and 4,000 deaths, mostly among the elderly, very young and immune compromised.</p>
<p>The swine-flu strain appears to be susceptible to the mainline anti-flu drug, Tamiflu. There are government and hospital stockpiles. But supplies are going to private pharmacies as well. Briedis says people are filling prescriptions for Tamiflu who are not sick.</p>
<p>"The pharmacist told me this stuff is flying off the shelves. He was reordering every day. If this is going to be a real pandemic, we're going to need all the Tamiflu we can get."</p>
<p>According to Scott, "My sense is that Tamiflu's effectiveness is going to be limited to a very narrow window, right at the beginning of the onset of symptoms. If you don't start taking it then, it's not going to be of great help."</p>
<p>What about masks? There are three ways of catching influenza, Briedis says. "You can have somebody cough gobs of mucus directly in your face. You can touch coughed mucus on an inanimate object -- say, a doorknob -- and touch your face and mouth and transmit it that way. Or by breathing in an aerosol," small particles that can stay in the air almost indefinitely. They also easily move around the edges of a regular surgical mask.</p>
<p>Briedis says surgical masks will provide no more than 10 to 20 per cent protection.</p>
<p>N95 masks, oval-shaped, tightly fitted masks that cover the whole face and nose down to below the chin, filter out these very small droplets.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Researchers gain insights from game's virtual plague; World of Warcraft sheds light on making quarantines effective</b>
</div><div>Vito Pilieci   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>793 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Experts studying epidemics such as the swine flu have long been stymied by computer models that lacked one critical variable: free will. Subjects in a computer model only do what the program tells them to do, not what they necessarily want to do.</p>
<p>So where would a self-respecting expert find a model that is more like the real world? In the virtual world, of course, in the online society created by the game World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>Researchers in Canada and around the world -- the real world, that is -- are using the lessons learned from a virtual plague that tore through World of Warcraft's community four years ago to better prepare for the mass quarantines that could be part of a full pandemic.</p>
<p>Global health organizations have a better understanding of how to make mass quarantines effective because the virtual plague gave them unprecedented insights into how a real population might react.</p>
<p>"Suddenly there did exist an experimental framework to watch how people would behave during an epidemic," said Nina Fefferman, assistant professor at the Center for Discreet Mathematics and Theoretical Computer Science at Rutgers University in New Jersey, and co-author of an influential study about the Warcraft plague. "That's exactly what we worry about in real world epidemics -- the little behaviours that we don't tell people to do or not to do, because we have never seen this happen before."</p>
<p>World of Warcraft found itself at the centre of the world epidemiological community in 2007 after a plague infected the online characters of millions of real players. The game allows people to create orcs, knights or other fantastical creatures, then embark on adventures around the virtual world of Azeroth, accumulating skills and power along the way.</p>
<p>In 2005, the game's designers at Blizzard Entertainment decided that some players' characters had become too powerful, so they created a virus -- called "Corrupted Blood" -- that would make the game more challenging for the most powerful players.</p>
<p>Turns out that even in the virtual world, things don't always turn out as planned. The virus quickly infected any nearby character, regardless of its relative strength.</p>
<p>The programmers imposed a mass quarantine, and expected players to take it seriously because "death" can cause their characters to lose items, strength, weapons and armour they had accumulated over many hours of play.</p>
<p>Yet many players ignored the quarantine, spreading the virus. Eventually, more than four million of the game's six million players worldwide were infected, and millions "died."</p>
<p>"That's one of the big question marks in epidemiological research: how do you predict human behaviour?" said Fefferman, who, like all epidemiologists, was previously limited to computer models or surveys. "We don't expect people to behave the same way in a virtual world, but it's closer than asking them hypothetical questions."</p>
<p>The virtual quarantine failed for various reasons. For example, some virtual characters spontaneously developed immunity, but were still carriers -- just as would happen in the real world. Some characters' virtual pets became carriers, just as could happen in the real world.</p>
<p>Many players stayed away from the game until the outbreak was taken care of. Many others insisted on playing despite the danger, whether it was to walk their character to a virtual "store" for supplies or to flee infected "cities" in an attempt to save themselves. The plague quickly spread from its epicentre to locations around the virtual world.</p>
<p>Fefferman and a colleague studied the plague as it spread and published their findings in the internationally respected Lancet Infectious Diseases Journal in 2007. The study focused on how a pandemic would spread and affect society and the economy. Since then, she's been called upon by health agencies all over the world to consult on her findings, including the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Army. Her data has also been studied by experts in Canada and other countries.</p>
<p>"The important thing for a researcher is to have the conversations and provide the insight to the policy makers, and that I know has been done," she said.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft is not the only video game helping to plan for pandemics. Suzanne de Castell, dean and professor with the faculty of education at Simon Fraser University, uses the video game Contagion to teach students the proper way to react during a pandemic.</p>
<p>"There is just so much valuable learning that can be accomplished through intelligent games," said de Castell. "All of the generalizations in the world are not going to address the questions of what an individual child, family or community actually does."</p>

<p>A B.C. elementary school will stay closed for a week after a student was diagnosed with swine flu and health officials said it's possible the student may have passed it on to others.</p>
<p>Beairsto Elementary school in Vernon, B.C., was closed yesterday as a precautionary step, though health officials said the child who attends the 500-student French immersion school suffered only a mild case of the H1N1 influenza A virus and is now recovering well.</p>
<p>Dr. Andrew Larder with the Interior Health Authority said in an interview that the student, a girl, returned home to B.C. last week after a trip to Mexico with her family.</p>
<p>"There were several days when the child was at school when there were symptoms and when she might have been able to pass the virus on to other people,'' Larder said. "We don't know the extent of that risk because we know very little about this virus. But certainly there's the possibility that it could have been spread to other people.''</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian officials announced a torrent of new confirmed swine flu cases yesterday but maintained the symptoms are mild and the new numbers were anticipated.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper assured the public that governments around the world are working together on the issue, even as Canada's caseload almost doubled to 34 with 15 new confirmations, including the first in Quebec.</p>
<p>"Thankfully, all cases in Canada continue to be mild,'' Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference in Ottawa. "I repeat again these new cases were anticipated and do not affect our approach.''</p>
<p>One notable change in approach, however, was announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Harper presaged the move when he alluded to the outbreak as the "Mexican flu'' during a news conference in Toronto yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, later told reporters in the capital that the virus will no longer be referred to as swine flu, but instead will be called the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the change is being made "to make it very clear that this disease is not spread from pigs or from either pork or pork products."</p>
<p>Harper plans to visit a Saskatchewan farm today, where that point will likely be driven home. Pork producers have taken a beating as consumers -- and some foreign governments -- have reacted irrationally to the spreading swine flu. So far, officials are tracing most cases of the virus to travellers to Mexico, although eight Canadian cases in all were not recent travellers to the country. Health officials are keeping a keen watch for what may be secondary infections as a signal to whether the virus is becoming established in the human population.</p>
<p>"In Canada now, within the school setting, possibly we're at sort of third generation or so -- that is, a person infecting another infecting another,'' Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Quebec health officials said the province's first confirmed case is a person from the Montreal area who was in Mexico recently and is now at home with a mild case of the flu. Of the 15 new cases reported yesterday, five were in B.C., four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario and one in Quebec.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>If you've visited Mexico and feel fine, don't go to the hospital emergency ward or family physician over worries you may be infected with swine flu, the region's medical officer of health urged yesterday.</p>
<p>"There's no point," said Dr. Nicola Mercer of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. "If you feel well and you've been to Mexico, you're (likely) well."</p>
<p>Mercer didn't want health professionals swamped with needless calls for help. They're busy preparing for a potential pandemic that hasn't shown up locally in confirmed cases but may in the days ahead, she said. The public health board is investigating several suspected cases, with lab test results expected as early as today, she said.</p>
<p>Only if significant flu-like symptoms -- fever, cough, sore throat, fatigue, chills, aches, vomiting -- develop should people seek medical attention, public health advised.</p>
<p>A highly contagious pandemic that began in Mexico, where hundreds are sick, and the U.S. has spread in recent days to other countries.</p>
<p>Canadian authorities yesterday reported almost three dozen confirmed domestic cases.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mercer's health board sent out reminders to front line health-care workers, schools, municipalities and others to take infection precautions, like sanitizing hands, covering mouth and nose when sneezing and coughing, staying isolated at home when ill and keeping vaccinations current. The latter is a precaution against seasonal flu strains.</p>
<p>Public health is the lead agency responding to the potential threat, co-ordinating effort with other health professionals like hospitals as it monitors the situation closely.</p>
<p>The increasingly hectic daily routine for Mercer's staff includes a 2 p.m. roundup meeting by her incident management team; staff efforts to craft communications bulletins for health care providers, schools and others; a mid-afternoon consulting for provincial updates and regular contacts with eternal partners like hospitals, laboratories, the Public Health Agency of Canada, provincial Ministry of Health and other health agencies. There's an end-of-day meeting to discuss the day's events.</p>
<p>Beginning today, public health is launching a 4 p.m. daily update for local media to heighten public awareness in a timely, orderly fashion, Mercer's board announced yesterday.</p>
<p>The two local school boards are disseminating public health's insight on health care precautions to schools and parents.</p>
<p>"We have a communique going out today," Wellington Catholic District School Board education director Don Drone said.</p>
<p>It'll go to every principal to distribute to his or her school community. Drone said this could be in the form of a regular newsletter or separate note to parents.</p>
<p>As a planning precaution, Drone said principals are being told that if 10 per cent of their school populations fall ill, this must be reported immediately to the public health board.</p>
<p>They're also being reminded that further flu health care advice is only a phone call or website away. The health board is posting updates and advice on its website: www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org]. Information is also available by calling 1-800-454-8302 or reaching TeleHealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000, around the clock.</p>

</p>
<p>I'm not sure what the status of this whole "swine flu" is going to be by the time you read this, but I doubt it'll be over and done and ready to be never heard from again. Here's hoping, but the media smells blood in the water, and the frenzy's begun to see which shark will be the first to call "pandemic."</p>
<p>Now hysteria isn't a great thing, but if there's one part of it I do enjoy it's that it affords me a chance to act superior; "If you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs," as Rudyard Kipling once wrote.</p>
<p>Of course Kipling was talking about standing up for one's principles, so here is mine: I'm not afraid, you shouldn't be afraid, and I should be allowed to turn on the TV news without it looking like the first reel of Dawn of the Dead.</p>
<p>By my count this is our third bullpen pandemic since the start of the century. I say "bullpen pandemic" because that's always where they seem to stay. We get some disease, it infects a few thousand, kills a few hundred and it's either never heard from again --SARS -- or just never seems to be a bother anymore -- bird flu.</p>
<p>Now I know we're overdue for a pandemic, kind of like how California is overdue for a continent sinking earthquake, and I don't mean to make light, but we're officially entering boy-who-cried-wolf territory. It's like when the Bush administration had Americans looking for terrorists under every pin cushion while raising the alert level willy-nilly. As if things were especially terroristy on a given day.</p>
<p>And the advice on how to deal was just as lame. Remember when duct tape and plastic window sheeting was advertised as literally the least you could do to combat a possible bio-attack? Well, it sure sounded effective at the time. In the case of swine flu, your first defence, as outlined by Toronto Mayor David Miller, is to wash your hands frequently, cover your mouth when you cough and, if you do get stick and stay at home.</p>
<p>All sound pieces of advice, and dare I say, practical. But I wonder though: isn't this advice kind of prosaic in the face of the world-smashing potential of swine flu? Further, if simply washing your hands is the least you can do to contain this thing, then why are our TV anchors positively losing their minds over this?</p>
<p>None of this is to say there isn't a danger. Whenever a highly contagious disease runs unchecked there's a chance of things getting really bad, really fast, especially in this era of air travel. But as Jon Stewart astutely observed on The Daily Show, when six people are infected, do you really have to light up all four-million-square-miles of the country's map in blood red?</p>
<p>And just as modern transportation has altered the way a disease is spread, our methods for combating disease has changed in the 90 years since the Spanish flu, which killed 25 million people worldwide. By comparisons, SARS killed nearly 800. Why the difference? Could it be there was no universal health care in 1918? Or that there was no such thing as genetic research? Even simple things like proper personal hygiene were a luxury for many. And indoor plumbing, while not exactly new, was still kind of one of those things they had in the Big City.</p>
<p>Our reaction to SARS now seems quaint, if not uproarious, in hindsight; The Rumoli Brothers, a Toronto-based comedy duo, even wrote a satirical musical about it called SARSical. So I'm sure those guys are glad for fresh material.</p>
<p>Assuming we survive, of course.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The swine flu outbreak will have ill effects on Ontario pork producers, a leading scientist and an industry insider said yesterday.</p>
<p>Even though the new strain of influenza did not originate solely in pigs, and can't be caught by consuming pork products, the damage to producers is probably already done.</p>
<p>"This is unfortunate for the pig producers in Ontario and North America," said Cate Dewey, chair of the department of population medicine, and professor of swine health management and epidemiology at the University of Guelph. "The price for pigs has gone down dramatically over the last week."</p>
<p>Many in Mexico, where the virus was first diagnosed, blame a large hog operation in that country for generating a deadly virus that is spreading globally and is suspected of killing 168 people and making nearly 3,000 people sick. But Dewey said blaming pig producers for the flu is unfair, and singling out swine as the sole source of the virus is inaccurate.</p>
<p>What has been called swine flu in this case, she said, is actually a potent concoction of human, bird and swine influenza strains that produced a new, virulent strain.</p>
<p>While it is a H1N1 flu strain, which is common in pigs, this new virus seems to have originated in people, she said, adding that the strain has not been found in any pigs in North America.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the virus was present in 11 countries, including Canada, where there are 34 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>"They are calling it a triple reassortment," explained Dewey, who is an expert in the study of influenza in Ontario pigs. She said because the new strain spreads so successfully among people, it is her assumption that this reassortment took place in a person, not a pig.</p>
<p>"Some people are wanting to say that it was from a large pig farm in Mexico, that this new virulent virus spread to the people, and I don't think that's true," Dewey said, explaining that had there been an outbreak among the farm's pigs, symptoms would have turned up in pigs and a large number of adult animals would have died.</p>
<p>That was not the case. Instead, the virus first appeared in people, and calling it swine flu is somewhat of a misnomer.</p>
<p>Pig farmers have been hit hard in recent years by slumping prices and increased costs of production. The flu outbreak, with its partial link to pigs, will likely make things worse for them, an Ontario Pork official said.</p>
<p>"Producers are really unhappy about the fact that it is even called swine flu," said Mary-Ann Hendrikx, vice-chair of Ontario Pork and a pig farmer in the Strathroy area. "When the influenza alert first came out, some of the futures markets dropped, which ultimately effects the price that we receive."</p>
<p>Hendrikx said the science surrounding the virus is not widely understood, and that the association with pigs will cause many to avoid pork products.</p>
<p>Ontario pork is exported around the world, and the market for those products could decline as a result of the flu scare.</p>
<p>The outbreak may spur increased criticism of large-scale pig operations, Hendrikx said. But it also gives the industry a chance to educate the public.</p>

<p>Yet within the span of a week, more than a year's worth of planning quickly unravelled.</p>
<p>Girvitz and his fiancée, Jennifer, are among countless Canadian couples whose Mexico weddings are in limbo because of the virus the World Health Organization is now calling H1N1 influenza A.</p>
<p>Numerous carriers have suspended travel to the country until at least the beginning of June.</p>
<p>Girvitz said he hadn't heard about the flu outbreak until the weekend, and initially wasn't too concerned. However, family and friends began voicing concerns, and he soon became worried when the World Health Organization raised its alert level.</p>
<p>Girvitz and his fiancée were scheduled to leave for Mexico on Sunday and to get married May 7.</p>
<p>Before they were able to make a decision on how to proceed, Air Canada announced that flights had been suspended.</p>
<p>"All this planning that's been going on and preparation -- Jenny's worked so hard over the last year to make this happen (and it has) literally just gone to waste,'' he said. "We've lost a year of our lives, essentially. I mean, no one's fault. You can never plan for something like this, and I know we're not the only ones going through something like this.</p>
<p>"I'm grateful that we have each other and that when it comes to the bottom line that we're together -- I can't ask for more than that.''</p>
<p>Their plans now cancelled, they're looking to have a small wedding ceremony in Calgary on the wedding date. Girvitz admits it will be a "bittersweet day.''</p>
<p>They are considering going to Mexico on their anniversary.</p>
<p>Michelle Mackie, 23, and her fiancé, Ian Rainone, 27, weren't set to leave for Mexico until May 23, but her bags were already packed in anticipation of their Mayan Riviera wedding. With travel to Mexico on hold, their plans have now been thrown off-kilter.</p>
<p>Mackie, of Port Moody, B.C., said she tried all Wednesday to reach wedding co-ordinators by telephone and email to make alternate arrangements, to no avail.</p>
<p>Mackie said their wedding group has spent $21,000 on flights and accommodation for the wedding. She and her fiancé are trying to get the money back through insurance.</p>
<p>"We have guests that are going back to college in the fall, and everybody booked off this week for a reason,'' she said. "From talking to our guests, they're not really too keen on waiting six months to maybe go to Mexico again with all of this going on.''</p>

Transmission: Believed to occur through coughing or sneezing, or touching contaminated surfaces before touching mouth or nose. Misconceptions: The biggest is the role of pork -- the CDC says people cannot get the flu by eating pork or pork products. Advice: Health officials urge those with flu-like symptoms to avoid work or school, wash hands, cough into sleeves and get medical attention.

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Sun Life employees are being given hand sanitizers and alcohol wipes to help protect them from swine flu.</p>
<p>The company started placing sanitizers on desks across the country yesterday and expects to complete the job today. As well, employees have been urged to hold virtual meetings when possible, most often by telephone.</p>
<p>The internal website is being updated to provide employees with the latest influenza news.</p>
<p>"We're in the business of protecting the health and safety of our employees," Sun Life spokesperson Steve Kee said.</p>
<p>"And we want to have the ability to continue serving our customers," Kee said. <span class="companylink">Sun Life Financial</span> is a major local employer. Kee said the firm already had a supply of sanitizers and he would not estimate costs for the effort. Alcohol wipes can be used to clean surfaces and computers, he said.</p>
<p>"What they're doing is not what we're recommending to workplaces," said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, associate medical officer of health for Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>Handwashing is a key way to limit the spread of flu. Workplaces are being urged to stock washrooms with liquid soap, disposable towels or hand-dryers. This is to help employees practise proper hygiene, which means: washing hands after using a washroom, before eating, after sneezing, and when hands feel dirty. Placing sanitizers at every desk is not seen as more effective.</p>
<p>"We want people to get used to doing the normal handwashing," Wang said. "We have not recommended to our workplaces anything special at this point."</p>
<p>The new virus out of Mexico has sparked an international health emergency and is being watched closely for its potential to become a deadly global outbreak. Ontario has eight mild cases.</p>
<p>Kee said Sun Life has a plan in place to continue operating if the worst happens. Companies have been urged to draft such plans. Information for employers is at www.region.waterloo.on.ca[http://www.region.waterloo.on.ca] and at www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca[http://www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca].</p>

</div><div>Allison Jones   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>786 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>On a day when Canadian cases of swine flu surged to 34, officials here moved to reassure the public while world health officials cautioned Mexico against pronouncements that the deadly spread of swine flu was stabilizing.</p>
<p>Worldwide 257 people have been confirmed by the World Health Organization to have swine flu -- or H1N1 influenza A, as the WHO is now calling it.</p>
<p>Fifteen new cases were confirmed in Quebec, British Columbia, Alberta, Nova Scotia and Ontario.</p>
<p>While all of the cases seen in this country so far have been mild, it appears eight of the infected people hadn't travelled recently to Mexico or California.</p>
<p>British Columbia health officials decided to close a school in Vernon, B.C., after a student was diagnosed with swine flu.</p>
<p>The WHO also announced yesterday it would stop using the term "swine flu'' after the agriculture industry and the UN food agency expressed concerns that the term was misleading consumers about pork.</p>
<p>Egypt began slaughtering thousands of pigs Wednesday in a misguided effort to prevent swine flu and the Iraqi government decided yesterday to kill three wild boars at the Baghdad Zoo.</p>
<p>Canada followed suit with a name change in an afternoon news conference.</p>
<p>"From this time we will be referring to this human virus as the H1N1 flu virus to make it very clear that this disease is not spread from pigs or from either pork or pork products,'' said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones also moved to reassure Canadians that despite an increase in cases and the World Health Organization putting the pandemic alert level at 5, a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent, the country is ready should the situation worsen.</p>
<p>"Right now that snapshot shows that a pandemic is highly likely,'' Butler-Jones said. "How severe it is remains to be seen. But Canadians should be reassured that we are among the most prepared in the world.''</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper also said yesterday that everything possible is being done to respond to swine flu and encouraged everyone to comply with the advice of health care officials.</p>
<p>"We are all very concerned about the situation,'' Harper said. "At the same time, people should rest assured that governments around the world are responding to this in an appropriate and co-ordinated way.''</p>
<p>But while all of Canada's cases have so far been mild, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health warned that could change.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen the severe picture that was in Mexico," Williams said. "It does give some ongoing reassurance to some extent, but it's still early and the virus can mutate as well. So while I want to reassure the public that so far it continues to perform in the mild level, I don't think we can be complacent."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico's top health official declared the number of new swine flu cases to be stabilizing in the nation at the epicentre of the outbreak.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization's flu chief, reacting to similar comments from other Mexican officials, cautioned that case numbers often go up and down, and said the WHO had yet to see concrete evidence that the flu's spread was levelling off.</p>
<p>"It's a mixed pattern out there,'' Dr. Keiji Fukuda said. "What's happening in one part of the country is not necessarily what's happening in another part of the country.''</p>
<p>The swine flu is suspected of sickening 2,955 people and killing 168 in Mexico, though the confirmed cases are at 260 people ill and 12 dead. One death has been reported outside Mexico, with a 23-month-old boy from Mexico dying in Texas.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. now stands at 128, according to officials in that country. Other confirmed cases include 13 in Spain, eight in Britain, three each in Germany and New Zealand, two in Israel and one each in Austria, Switzerland and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>The Red Cross said yesterday it is readying an army of 60 million volunteers who can be deployed around the world to help slow the virus's spread.</p>

<p>1Canadian consumers are bargain hunting when it comes to brand names but will not give up their digital TV, home Internet or wireless services.</p>
<p>A new study by Toronto ad agency Bensimon Byrne and Gandalf Group reveals a “culture of thrift” emerging, with 81 per cent of those surveyed saying they have cut spending.</p>
<p>Of 1,500 people surveyed, 84 per cent said they cared less about brand names and 81 per cent said they were more likely to buy no-name products.</p>
<p>However, digital TV, home Internet and wireless have emerged as the “new utilities,” with almost 70 per cent refusing to cut back on what they deem to be essential.</p>
<p>2Avoiding germs is the best way to</p>
<p>prevent the spread of swine flu, and the makers of everything from soap to face masks want to make sure consumers get the message.</p>
<p>Purell and HandClens hand sanitizers, Dial soap and Lysol disinfectant spray are among the brands getting a marketing boost, with some brands offering coupons and free samples.</p>
<p>Retailers are also getting in on the act, with Global Autoclave Compliance offering a “Swine Flu Protection Kit” for $19, and Safety Videos Now selling a “Swine Flu Safety” DVD for $47. New York ad agency Digo is producing designer face masks that it plans to sell online for $100 (U.S.).</p>

<div id="hd"><b>CAE capitalizes on air training for military staff</b>
</div><div>BRENT JANG    </div>
<div>571 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p>For <span class="companylink">CAE Inc</span>., CAE-T the sales pitch to defence departments around the world trumpets the financial savings of training military staff in flight simulators instead of tying up helicopters and transport aircraft.</p>
<p>Every 60 minutes in a sophisticated facsimile of a real cockpit costs the same as six minutes of air training in actual copters and planes, CAE tells its receptive audiences.</p>
<p>Simulator training at just a 10th of the cost of live training also avoids the wear and tear inflicted on aircraft by rookie pilots.</p>
<p>Armed with such impressive data, Montreal-based CAE has been able to tout its state-of-the-art technology with considerable success since chief executive officer Robert Brown gave marching orders for staff to boost the military division's profile four years ago.</p>
<p>“Before, we had a high reliance on selling full-flight simulators in the civil sector, but Mr. Brown has really put the focus on diversifying,” CAE chief operating officer Marc Parent said yesterday .</p>
<p>Now, with the recession and swine flu outbreak reducing travel demand and threatening future orders of simulators from cash-strapped commercial airlines, CAE is in a good position to weather tough times because military contracts are pouring in.</p>
<p>For its fiscal year ended March 31, the company garnered a record $1.09-billion in military orders for simulation products and training services for pilots and other personnel, up 47 per cent from $740-million in the previous fiscal year, CAE announced yesterday.</p>
<p>More than $540-million in military orders came in the fourth quarter, and some analysts expect the robust business to continue for another couple of years, given ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and conflicts elsewhere. Even if peace were to somehow spread globally, analysts say, defence departments would still be spending money in preparation for the next war.</p>
<p>CAE's roots in Canada date back 62 years, marked by ongoing investments in research and development. The company currently employs 7,000 staff in 20 countries.</p>
<p>“We've been known around the world for our civil simulators, designed and manufactured in Canada,” Mr. Parent said. “On the military side, our brand and our expertise are now equally recognized. We don't build planes, but we do simulation and training, and in order to do that you need to be good at it.”</p>
<p><span class="companylink">CIBC World Markets Inc</span>. analyst Chris Murray said CAE has whipped itself into shape. He forecasts that overall revenue growth in simulation products and training services will be at least 12 per cent in the current fiscal year, but could be sluggish for civil simulation products and training.</p>
<p>“CAE has done a nice job of diversifying. They have good things happening on the military side, which is going to offset some of weakness that we'll probably see in the civil business,” Mr. Murray said.</p>
<p>Key orders have included the Canadian training contract for the C-130J military transport aircraft, an extension of training support services with Australia through 2018 and developing full-mission simulators for the British military.</p>
<p>CAE has a worldwide network of 27 civil aviation and military training centres, including its Tampa-based site for training on Lockheed Martin C-130 Hercules aircraft.</p>
<p>“The military side will be a strong story for CAE,” Mr. Murray said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Respirator masks flying off city shelves - Health officials warn against panic buying</b>
</div><div>By Kevin Rollason   </div>
<div>622 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Respirator masks are selling like hotcakes at medical supply and drug stores in Winnipeg, despite a warning from health officials that masks are unnecessary and could heighten public fear over the H1N1 influenza, formerly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Even though no one in the province has been diagnosed with the flu, at least one medical supply outlet is advertising masks for sale on a large sign outside.</p>
<p>The respirator mask of choice is the N-95, the mask recommended by both the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Centers for Disease Control in the United States. It has the ability to filter out 95 per cent or more of certain airborne particles. It also meets CDC guidelines for tuberculosis exposure control.</p>
<p>Gerald Diamond, co-owner of Diamond Athletic Medical Supplies in the building housing the Pan Am Clinic, said the store has a self-imposed restriction on sales of particulate respirator masks to individuals because of the high demand.</p>
<p>"We've been selling bazillions of them," Diamond said Thursday.</p>
<p>"We're limiting how many you can take -- five boxes or so instead of a case." As the flu spread across the continent Saturday, staff checked to see how many masks they had in stock.</p>
<p>"By Monday we were out of them," Diamond said.</p>
<p>Manitoba's chief medical officer, Dr. Joel Kettner, said he's not recommending people wear masks, since they often wear them incorrectly and have a false sense of security that they're protected against flu. Kettner said Manitobans planning to walk around in masks in malls and schools could also heighten public anxiety about the new virus that's surfaced around the globe.</p>
<p>"Masks have to actually be working properly," Kettner said. "Some people might think they're protected and they're not.</p>
<p>"I don't think it's wise."</p>
<p>Public health officials across the country are discussing issues like whether or not the general public should wear masks during their daily communication briefings. So far, Kettner said, the consensus is it's inappropriate at this stage of the outbreak, and that the only people who should wear masks are those who may be infected with H1N1 flu and the health-care workers caring for them.</p>
<p>To date, no confirmed cases of the flu have been reported in Manitoba. Nine suspected cases all tested negative for the virus.</p>
<p>Diamond said they are getting more in, but the manufacturers have already warned they may become even more scarce in the coming days. Each box holds 100 masks.</p>
<p>"The manufacturers are on a pandemic level of awareness and they say they'll provide more content to us, but hospitals and professionals are first."</p>
<p>Diamond said it's similar to when masks flew off shelves during the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto.</p>
<p>"With SARS, it seemed so traumatic at the time and the outcomes were so negative people were panicking. But the outcome here doesn't seem as bad."</p>
<p>Sarah Tattersall, a spokeswoman for 3M Canada in London, Ont., said the company is seeing high demand for its N-95 respirator masks.</p>
<p>"We have increased global production," Tattersall said.</p>
<p>"We do expect the demand will outpace the supply as we go forward, so a lot of the supply is going to the most needed areas."</p>
<p>Medigas general manager Rai Arndt said most of the sales at the McPhillips Street outlet have been to health-care professionals.</p>
<p>"We haven't had that many private people," Arndt said, adding the business has sold 400 boxes of masks in recent days when "normally we would sell a box here and there."</p>

</p>
<p>France yesterday called for all European flights to Mexico to be suspended, but the World Health Organization and some Canadian experts say travel restrictions between countries will do little to curb the spread of swine flu and may be more politically motivated than scientifically based.</p>
<p>The disease has clearly jumped beyond the borders of Mexico and into other continents, so interrupting travel routes will have no real impact, said Dr. Gerald Evans, an infectious disease specialist at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.</p>
<p>Urging people not to visit a place like Mexico could, however, needlessly increase anxiety around the situation, he said.</p>
<p>"Attempts to contain it at this point are really not there," said Dr. Evans, also president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.</p>
<p>"I don't really think that travel advisories at this point are warranted. I frankly think ... this is more of a political kind of thing. It's for political people to be able to say, 'We did something. We publicly did something.' It's based more on that kind of direction than good science or medicine."</p>
<p>Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta Hospital in Edmonton, said she agrees that choking off travel to Mexico or other affected countries will not slow the spread. "The horse is kind of out of the barn at this point."</p>
<p>She did say, however, that individuals contemplating a trip to Mexico may want to rethink their plans to avoid adding to their risks of contracting the virus.</p>
<p>European health ministers yesterday rejected the French call to suspend EU flights to Mexico, saying it would be up to individual states to decide on any travel curbs.</p>
<p>Dr. Keiji Fukuda, the WHO official leading the swine flu fight, has repeatedly advised against travel restrictions.</p>
<p>Stephen Hunter, head of operations at Sunwing Vacations, also expressed his frustration at the Canadian government's decision to issue a blanket warning on travel to Mexico this week, arguing that not all parts of Mexico were affected by the disease. He said it used the same logic that led to tourism being decimated in all parts of Canada after an outbreak of SARS in Toronto in 2003.</p>
<p>In the wake of the WHO's controversial warning against visiting Toronto during the SARS crisis, a federal advisory panel on the outbreak recommended the WHO and member nations work out an agreed set of standards for issuing travel advisories. The system should include giving advance notice to the target country and consulting with it if possible, said the panel's 2004 report.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Sunwing, along with all Canadian tour operators, cancelled their flights to Mexico out of concern for the safety of their passengers and crews. The tour operators were offering to postpone travel plans until a later date, or to fly passengers to another location, but said no refunds were being offered.</p>
<p>The decision by tour operators not to refund passengers has caused a rift between the tour operators and travel agents in Canada.</p>
<p>The Association of Retail Travel Agents, which represents hundreds of travel agents across the country, called on the tour operators yesterday to offer full refunds to their passengers, in part because consumer confidence had already been rattled by the abrupt collapse of Conquest Vacations Inc. in April.</p>
<p>"This was an elective decision," said Bruce Bishins, ARTA chief executive, about the tour operators cutting their flights. "I'm not suggesting that the voluntary cessation of tourism to Mexico is inappropriate. It is appropriate, but that does not give them the licence to hold on to the money."</p>

<p>A good panic doesn't just come out of nowhere. Sure, it seems effortless in the moment – the worried headlines, the nervous commentators, the lunchroom buzz – but really, it takes years of preparation to work up phobias that can be released on a moment's notice. Take the swine flu that's got everyone so jumpy this week. Pandemics loom large in the public imagination when it comes to apocalypse scenarios, right up there with having our robotic servants turn on us. We wouldn't be so worried that the flu would be the end of us if we hadn't been looking askance at every dead bird since the summer of SARS. This is one well-rehearsed freak-out.</p>
<p>In a way, the same can be said for the “<span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer” story that bumped the swine flu from the news (and none too soon). The label refers to one Philip Markoff, a 23-year-old Boston medical student who is charged with the murder of a woman who had posted an erotic ad on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>. Markoff allegedly answered her ad, later corresponding with her over e-mail and cellphone.It's hard to pin down exactly why the “<span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer” nickname stuck, but it did. Maybe it's our curious affinity for giving murderers the same kind of handles we give superheroes. Maybe it's the alliterative way that “the <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer” rolls off the tongue; it's certainly more assonant than “The <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, then E-mail and Cellphone Killer.” But judging by the way the case sparked a moral panic about <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> itself, the ready association people drew between the two words seems more than just phonetic.</p>
<p>The copious coverage that followed seemed to feature almost as many screenshots of <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> as they did pictures of the suspect himself. Columnists sounded off about the Internet's dark corners. Local TV news squads took to the streets, filming passersby as they shook their heads and vowed they'd never answer an ad from those creeps online.</p>
<p>And then there was a bizarre piece on ABC's Nightline, in which anchor Martin Bashir perched on the edge of founder Craig Newmark's desk and demanded to know whether Newmark is a “law-abiding citizen of America,” and if so, why he's facilitating prostitution by allowing naughty ads on his website.</p>
<p>Newmark mumbled a sort of uncategorical non-denial, but he wasn't lacking for defenders. It didn't take long for people to start pointing out the patently obvious: There is nothing about <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> that contributed to this crime. Connecting <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> to the actions of someone who answers an ad is as silly as blaming a newspaper for the actions of someone who answered an ad and did something terrible. The prudish can get worked up about the fact that <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> runs plenty of thinly veiled ads from prostitutes – but here, that's tantamount to blaming the victim: She advertised, therefore she was asking for it.</p>
<p>But just like any other outbreak of hysteria, this didn't come from nowhere. The <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> moral panic had been brewing out of sight, waiting for its moment to erupt. It's tempting to write this off as another case of semi-informed Internet phobia – remember the moral panic over MySpace, which was said to be full of child predators? – but while there's no connection between <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and the crime, it does shoulder responsibility for the panic.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> has always walked a fine line between anarchy and grungy respectability. It made its name as the under-moderated, anything-goes website. Craig Newmark has curated an image for himself as a disinterested broker whose motivations are neither corporate, commercial nor moral. He's just a guy named Craig, see, and he's got this list, and he wants to help people connect – that's his shtick.</p>
<p>There's something disconcerting about <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>'s amoral nature. The company seems to float above the mores of commerce and law. It eviscerated the classified-advertising market that supported the newspaper business, but didn't keep most of the proceeds for itself. Newmark is said to make a pretty penny, but he's not selling the site for the usual Silicon Valley billions. Instead, he gives most of its services away for free.</p>
<p>And the laissez-faire nature of those services helped make him. The fact that those who would exchange sex for cash are among the millions who advertise on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> is probably more shocking to people who don't live in cities where alt-weekly newspapers run porny ads for escort services all the time. But even for the hardened, <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> occasionally comes out with something truly eye-popping: I vividly recall discovering shelter-for-sex ads on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> after Katrina hit New Orleans.</p>
<p>The libertine act comes at a price. <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> is a pile of contradictions that nobody knows quite how to read. It's not bound by the rules of a corporation trying to look good or a non-profit trying to do good, and it's riddled with salaciousness.</p>
<p>It's a great formula, but all it took was a scandalous news story that involved some possible combination of sex, a murder and <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, and everybody's worst assumptions about the site seemed to have been realized. It didn't matter that the shoe, as it were, didn't fit. <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> has been plaguing the Internet with diffuse anxiety for years, even as we enjoyed its services. I can't feel too bad for Craig and his list, this week. It's no fair that they got stuck with the “<span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer.” But this is a panic that was waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Action Boys</p>
<p>Byung-gil Jung (South Korea)</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Look out, Stephen Chow: There's a generation of wannabe Asian film stars just dying to take your place – and some are prepared to flip a burning car as many times as it takes to get noticed. Action Boys follows the lives of several classmates of the Seoul Action School, which puts aspiring stuntmen through an intense, months-long training program to feed the Korean action-flick industry. Graduation could propel you to instant stardom – or, as most of the students find out, sentence you to years of acrobatic flips, falls and fractures (as in bone), all for 10 or 15 seconds of actual screen time. Though there are touching moments, the film moves too quickly and is too disjointed to really connect with any of its subjects. It is, however, easy to empathize with just how much these guys love the movies. And, yes, the action scenes are great. C.V.</p>

<p>Amerika Idol: A True Story</p>
<p>Barry Avrich (Canada)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>You'll be in a Borat state of mind while watching this 34-minute documentary by Toronto's Barry Avrich. It's the quasi-heroic tale of a bunch of Serbian villagers who think erecting a sculpture of Rocky Balboa in the centre of their village will boost civic pride and tourism. When the villagers learn that a replica of the famous monument Thomas Schomberg created for Rocky III will cost $1.5-million (U.S.), they turn to local artist Boris Staparac for a cement facsimile and Agroziv, “the most powerful chicken company in eastern Europe,” for the money. Avrich plays it mostly for laughs and charm, knowing the chutzpah and earnestness of his Serb subjects are mirthful enough without any parodic gilding. Sylvester Stallone pops up from time to time to cheer on the natives. World premiere. J.A.</p>

<p>Ana and Arthur</p>
<p>Larry Young (Canada)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Spoiler: There is no sex in this film. Or any Jerry Springer-style melodrama. Yes, this film documents the seven-year romance between a 70-year-old doctor named Ana and her 35-year-old protégé Arthur. But the harps are no longer playing by the time we meet them. Instead, this is a quiet portrait of the dissolution of love. Arthur has given up medicine for farming – the pair run a retreat for patients with chronic diseases – and has swapped his mentor for another woman. Being dumped is no easier in your silver years. The pain here is real and raw. “He's the first human being to which I have revealed myself,” says Ana, her voice quavering. What's missing from this universal story, though, are the particulars. The couple's past is hazy, and theirs are the only voices in the film. And how are we to judge them without the juicy details? J.T.</p>

<p>Big River Man</p>
<p>John Maringouin (U.S.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Borat meets Heart of Darkness in this chronicle of Slovenian strongman Martin Strel's quest to be the first man to swim the Amazon River. At 53, substantially overweight with high blood pressure and a fondness for booze, Strel seems like a buffoon. The film's narration, provided by Strel's son Borut, has unmistakable echoes of the ingenuous boasting of Sacha Baron Cohen's fictional character, Borat (his son's name is Borut). The actual swim is anything but funny: It's a prolonged exercise in physical and mental torture, as Strel risks his physical health and temporarily loses his sanity, in conditions where he might be killed at any time. Much of Big River Man is irresistible, but the montages designed to signify Martin's deteriorating mental state feel overcalculated. It's also discomfiting to notice that Borut's narration is co-authored by the director and another writer. L.L.</p>

<p>Burma VJ – Reporting from a Closed Country</p>
<p>Anders Ostergaard (Denmark)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Everyone remembers the headlines from September, 2007: “Nine protesters dead as Myanmar violence continues,” and “Toll mounts as brutal regime bares its teeth.” Those who watched the newscasts may also remember the videos: gritty, shaky footage of the country's security forces opening fire on thousands of protesters, led by hundreds of Buddhist monks. Burma VJ is the fascinating story of the small group of underground reporters armed with Handycams who risked their lives to get those images on tape and smuggle them to the outside world. Director Anders Ostergaard compiles footage gathered by the Democratic Voice of Burma, and “Joshua,” one of the DVB's young VJs who co-ordinated the team of reporters, tells the story. It's a rare chance to witness those weeks in September through the eyes of the people who were there. C.V.</p>

<p>Clubland</p>
<p>Eric Geringas (Canada)</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Geared toward TV rather than cinema, Clubland has as much nuance as the party kids who cram Toronto's Entertainment District on any given weekend. Ambiguities are not the film's, nor the neighbourhood's, strong suit. Clubland is a clash of interests, from the young people looking to score to the jaded club owners raking in money to the local residents putting up with the nightly bedlam outside. There's little evidence here of the culture that once made large techno dance clubs a destination for new music and a communal vibe, despite what club impresario Peter Gatien says. What's left in Clubland are kids with too much money, too much hair gel and not much of a story to tell. G.D.</p>

<p>The Cove</p>
<p>Louie Psihoyos (U.S.)</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>This slick, high-impact eco-activist film was the hit of the Sundance Film Festival and may be the documentary film of the year. The Cove follows Richard O'Barry, a former trainer and star on the TV series Flipper and now a passionate dolphin advocate, as he leads a well-resourced team on a Mission Impossible attempt to slip past Japanese security and secretly document the illegal mass harpooning of dolphins in a cove in Taiji. There is some cause for misgivings about the film's manipulative technique – would film footage of a legal abattoir be any less disturbing? – but as an effective detective story and impassioned call for change, The Cove pushes all the right buttons.

<p>Defamation</p>
<p>Yoav Shamir (Israel)</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>It begins pleasantly enough, to the sound of klezmer music, until filmmaker Yoav Shamir's 90-minute documentary becomes a film constructed almost entirely of passionately held and vigorously defended ideological positions. Shamir asks: Is anti-Zionism, or at least criticism of Israel, the same as anti-Semitism? For some Jews, such as Anti-Defamation League director Abraham Foxman, the son of Holocaust survivors, the answer is indisputably yes – it's a small step from derogatory comment to genocide. But for others, such as Norman Finkelstein, author of The Holocaust Industry – and also the son of Holocaust survivors – Israel and its American supporters have exploited the Holocaust for political and financial gain. With his affable manner and simple camera work, Shamir manages to get startling, candid comments from the two foes, as well as from other equally frank academics, religious leaders and Jews young and old. The film would make a wonderful companion piece to Jonathan Demme's Man from Plains, which followed Jimmy Carter's tour for his book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid. But on its own, Shamir's film stands as an intellectually challenging and emotionally draining look at a people pulled at, and pulled apart, by history and destiny. M.C.</p>

<p>Fierce Light: When Spirit Meets Action</p>
<p>Velcrow Ripper (Canada)</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>In this film about the marriage of spirituality to political protest, Vancouver documentarian Velcrow Ripper interviews everyone from Archbishop Desmond Tutu to environmentalist Julia Butterfly Hill (who lived in a tree for two years to save it from the axe) and films stirring demonstrations of spiritual people in action everywhere from South Central Los Angeles, where locals resist eviction from the market garden they have planted on a vacant lot, to Vietnam, where people float candles down a river to remember the war dead of both sides. Ripper claims that spiritually infused protest and action is on the rise as humanity comes to recognize its interconnectedness, but provides no objective evidence, only the testimonials of the converted. Meanwhile, he leaves pertinent details about these protests and their organizers on the cutting-room floor. This doc is mainly preaching to the choir. K.T.</p>

<p>Fixer: The Taking of Ajmal Naqshbandi</p>
<p>Ian Olds (U.S.)</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>“I bring one enemy to meet another.” This is how 24-year-old Ajmal Naqshbandi describes his job as a “fixer,” someone who helps foreign journalists negotiate, translate and arrange interviews in Afghanistan. Naqshbandi was kidnapped by the Taliban in 2007 while working with Daniele Mastrogiacomo, a reporter from Italy. Mastrogiacomo was released in a prisoner swap, but Naqshbandi was beheaded after the Afghan government refused to concede to any more of his captor's demands. His story is told through American journalist Christian Parenti, who also worked with Naqshbandi – it's an eye-opening account of how reporters operate in war zones and the relationships that develop between colleagues. A warning: some of the footage is incredibly hard to watch – but not as hard as looking at Naqshbandi's face, broad, friendly and smiling, knowing the fate that awaits. C.V.</p>

<p>Ganesh: Boy Wonder</p>
<p>Srinivas Krishna (Canada)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A young Indian boy, born with a deformity protruding where his nose should be, is treated with awe by those who see in him the elephant visage of the Hindu god Ganesh, and by others with trepidation, as all deformities are treated by mankind. While the filmmaker may have been angling for a larger investigation into the role of religious idols and customs in hectic, contemporary India, he instead chose the true heart of the story: simply two parents, barely surviving together under the strain and medical costs, and an utterly sweet, eager little boy.

<p>Inside Hana's Suitcase</p>
<p>Larry Weinstein (Canada)</p>
<p>***½</p>
<p>An expertly crafted documentary on a well-known story: A suitcase belonging to a Holocaust victim is delivered to an educator in Tokyo who wants to display it in her Holocaust resource centre. She then embarks on an international search for information on its owner, the orphaned Czech girl Hana Brady, and how her suitcase wound up among an assortment of artifacts from Auschwitz. What unfolds is a story that's remarkable on many historical and emotional levels. The film presents it all through in a highly complicated structure, building the drama by jumping narratives and using children who have studied Hana's story to give insight from a child's perspective. Weinstein handles it superbly, creating a moving and valuable film for adults and children. G.D.</p>

<p>Invisible City</p>
<p>Hubert Davis (Canada)</p>
<p>***½</p>
<p>Hubert Davis, nominated for his 2004 short Hardwood, and his beautifully serene touch tackles the subject of two inner-city boys in Toronto's Regent Park neighbourhood. The kids two can be exasperating, with their inability to see beyond their immediate school and family troubles. Dropping out is the easy option, as their neighbourhood is knocked down and redeveloped around them. As a documentary take on the alienation described in of Ralph Ellison's famous novel Invisible Man, Davis shows his deft touch at portraying the hope and pain in the mundane, the joy and strife of ordinary life. A sure sign of a strong, emerging talent, you go to a Davis film as much to see where he's taking his style as much for the actual subject matter. G.D.</p>

<p>Jackpot</p>
<p>Alan Black (Canada)</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Bingo, the game we associate with such innocent activities as church socials and teaching kids their letters and numbers, apparently has a dark side. In this modest study of one downtown Toronto bingo hall, filmmaker Alan Black follows the histories and dreams of several of the regulars, who find the bingo hall a haven from boredom and loneliness. The dark side is that this essentially boring, skill-free game is still a form of gambling and it causes compulsive players to blow hundreds of dollars that should be reserved for rent and bills. Jackpot screens alongside another Toronto-set documentary, Clubland, about the downtown entertainment district. L.L.</p>

<p>Laughology</p>
<p>Albert Nerenberg (Canada)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Laughter is no joke to director Albert Nerenberg, who has lost his sense of silly. And so he undertakes a quest to find the causes and benefits of laughter. The result is a nicely paced film about chuckling that finds out what <span class="companylink">Reader's Digest</span> has known for years – that laughter is indeed the best medicine. Specifically, it's more contagious than swine flu, as well as a life-stretching, immune-system-boosting reaction to stress. A hike for ha-ha-ha takes us the world over, including Africa, where laughing is apparently epidemic. Nerenberg's overly sober narration, meant to convey his supposed inability to giggle, isn't convincing. As for the likable film's conclusion that laughing is unstoppably catchy, your best bet for verification is to attend a pair of festival screenings. B.W.</p>

<p>Love at the Twilight Motel</p>
<p>Alison Rose (Canada)</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>This doc about a rooms-by-the-hour motel in Miami's 8th Street strip in Little Havana is a remarkable testament to the power of letting people tell their own stories. In English and in Spanish, the man with a prudish wife, the woman who is sleeping with a colleague, the massage therapist who is happy to please married women and the plus-size escort all explain why they come to a place where every parking spot features a private staircase up to a room. Director Alison Rose neither judges nor comments, but she edits highly effectively, slowly building from her subjects' commonsense justifications of sex without commitment to their underlying stories of drug addiction and despair. Nobody who hears the two prostitutes describing in heartbreaking detail how they got into this line of work could ever try to argue that nobody is getting hurt at the Twilight Motel. K.T.</p>

<p>Objectified</p>
<p>Gary Hustwit (U.S.)</p>
<p>**</p>
<p>Coming after Helvetica, one of those transformative docs that sharpens your eye and tunes your senses, Gary Hustwit's latest is a minor disappointment. That's largely because of its major theme, nothing less than a look at the broad topic of how manufactured objects, everything from cars to toothbrushes, are designed. Badly designed, in most cases. The talking heads are occasionally interesting, and the portrayed objects are often lovely, but the film suffers from its own design flaw – a lack of specificity and focus. Like an excitable moth, it flits to and fro, alighting on many fascinating issues (for example, how the microchip has shattered the old maxim that form must follow function) but tarrying on none of them. In short – more matter, less dart. R.G.</p>

<p>Alan Kohl (Canada)</p>
<p>**½</p>
<p>For a long time, street artist Peter Gibson couldn't get a break. He faced arrest and prosecution for the stencil art he painted on Montreal roads, even if locals recognized it for the wonderful work that it is. Gibson's ambivalence when describing his work doesn't help. Nor does the fact that, despite the film's best efforts to bring the work to life and to include larger discussions on public art, street art simply loses some of its impact and immediacy when analyzed on film.

<p>Greg Barker (U.S.)</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>Sergio Vieira de Mello, a dashing Brazilian-born United Nations high commissioner, was a renowned humanitarian and brilliant diplomatic fixer. Shortly after he was sent to Iraq in 2003, he was targeted by al-Qaeda and killed, along with 21 members of his staff, by a truck bomb. Filmmaker Greg Barker's film, based on the book by Samantha Powers, inter-cuts between two different timelines: One follows Vieira de Mello's remarkable globetrotting career, the other follows the circumstances of his death. The story of the attempted rescue is told by two military firemen, one a tough-minded pragmatist, the other an evangelist, who shared the diplomat's last hours and were deeply moved by the experience. Vieira de Mello was not remotely pious, or even religious, but the portrait that emerges of his life and death seems like the story of an authentic saint. L.L.</p>

<p>Tyson</p>
<p>James Toback (U.S.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>James Toback's stylized talk-therapy session with disgraced heavyweight fighter Mike Tyson is a compelling demonstration of sympathy for the devil. The retired boxer, famous for his wife abuse, rape conviction and biting off boxer Evander Holyfield's ear as he is for any of his youthful accomplishments in the ring, is typically portrayed as some species of violent animal. Toback's deep-therapy approach yields different results: Tyson, now 42, comes across as a complex, vulnerable character, reasonably bright and candid, but full of fear and suspicion. Growing up as an overweight kid with glasses and asthma, he transformed from victim to bully, and in his life seems to have trusted only one person, his late manager and mentor, Cus D'Amato. You can feel for Tyson's extraordinary loneliness and still shudder when flashes of his old rage show, especially when he talks about women. L.L.</p>

<p>Waterlife</p>
<p>Kevin McMahon (Canada)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Travelling the once-Great Lakes from the northern reaches of Superior to the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Waterlife is a dire warning in the vessel of a tone poem, simultaneously a lyrical paean to the lakes' lingering beauty and a relentless documentation of their rising toxicity. In a thirsty world, the millions of us who live by these shores have sullied our geographical blessing, both reaping and raping the lakes' bounty. What we've pumped into them – raw sewage, invasive predators, chemical pollutants – is now flowing back to us in a tide that is certainly lethal and perhaps irreversible. If some of the doc's lyricism (frolicking children, breaking waves in beatific slow-mo) begins to seem repetitive and a little precious, the dark facts themselves are an indictment to be ignored at our peril, one more inconvenient truth on the planet's mounting list.

<p>Ondi Timoner (U.S.)</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Before <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and Twitter, there was Josh Harris, an Internet pioneer who predicted the end of private life through social networking online. Director Ondi Timoner (of the rock doc, DIG!) takes us deep inside Harris's bizarre ego trip over two decades, as he rose to fame and eventually squandered his $80-million fortune on parties and sometimes sadistic experiments where he used himself and his friends as human guinea pigs. In his most famous project to celebrate the turn of the millennium, he put about 100 people in an underground bunker fixed with multiple cameras, an interrogation room, an open bar and a gun range. The tension here comes from the contradictions in Harris's personality: His personal social skills are negligible, but his vision of society has been spot on. L.L.</p>

<p>You know you've done it. You've clicked on that YouTube clip of a geeky kid performing a light-sabre routine with a golf-ball retriever. Or that guy whipping himself with his own num chucks. But these “stars” didn't seek out fame. So what's it like to find out that, say, an RV promotional video you did back in 1989 – in which you swear up a blue streak – has been seen by millions? This film tracks down one Jack Rebney, a.k.a. The Angriest Man in the World, to inquire. Along the way, though, Rebney, who still has a way with expletives, turns the tables on us: Who are the “crazy lunatics,” he asks – the man cursing in the clips, or the people who watch him? This doc is sure to be screened in Contemporary Studies classes for years to come. J.T.</p>

<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>apicard@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>I keep reading about a deadly pandemic, but it's not defined. Can you tell us bluntly how bad swine flu could get in Canada?</p>
<p>According to mathematical modelling done as part of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan, a new strain such as swine influenza A/H1N1 could kill 11,000 to 58,000 Canadians in a period of about six to eight weeks. The pandemic could also result in the hospitalization of 35,000 to 138,000 people and leave 4.5 million to 10.6 million others too sick to work, which would have a devastating economic impact.</p>
<p>The range of impact is broad and reflects the fact that it is impossible to predict how virulent a pandemic strain might be. In a typical influenza season, 10 to 25 per cent of people get infected, because many are protected by vaccination and natural immunity. In a pandemic – where essentially no one has immunity – 30 to 50 per cent of the population would likely become ill in a short time period. But it is impossible to know the “attack rate.” While these numbers can be frightening, they need to be kept in context. In a typical year, 4,000 to 8,000 Canadians die of the flu and 20,000 to 40,000 are hospitalized.</p>
<p>If there is a swine flu pandemic, will it start immediately?</p>
<p>Outbreaks and epidemics of influenza tend to happen in the winter months. While there are some swine flu cases in Canada now – 34 cases as of last night – epidemiologists think it likely that the disease will disappear in Canada in the coming weeks, with the advent of warmer weather; but they also fear it could return with a vengeance in the fall. History tells us pandemics don't hit in one fell swoop, but in waves.</p>
<p>Why is the mainstream media covering up the truth about the swine flu epidemic? It's obvious that the real reason for the epidemic is factory farming. Massive hog operations are incubators for disease and they are the source of this virus.</p>
<p>Much has been made of the fact that Edgar Hernandez, the five-year-old boy dubbed “patient zero,” lived near a big hog farm operated by U.S. company <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods</span>. But the fact remains the source of the new virus is not yet known – it could be a big farm, a small farm, or from a single pig in someone's backyard. Remember, too, that little Edgar had the first laboratory confirmed case of A/H1N1 influenza; it's highly unlikely he was the first person infected. And, unlike bird flu, the source is not particularly important as people are not contracting the illness from swine, but from other people.</p>
<p>That being said, it is worth addressing the broader issue raised – the impact of large-scale commercial farming on human health. David Waltner-Toews, author of Food, Sex and Salmonella, notes that “factory farming” is a largely meaningless term. There are well-run, large-scale operations with highly educated farmers; crowded, dirty farms where farm workers and animals alike are exploited; and everything in between, so the risk of disease spreading in animals and humans from these sites varies widely. And he adds this sobering note: “I would be the first to say that economies of scale are the economies of epidemics (large populations of susceptible animals mean that if disease gets in it will spread more easily). However, farmers are giving us what we want – low-cost meats in large quantities – in the best way they know how.” In other words, we are reaping what we sow, and disease may be a part of the harvest.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence yet in H1N1 swine flu victims of a cytokine storm?</p>
<p>The job of cytokines is to send a signal to immune cells like T-cells and macrophages that there is an invader in the body such as a swine flu virus. They also tell the immune system to produce more cytokines. Normally, this feedback loop is self-limiting but in some instances production goes into overdrive – a cytokine storm. The overstimulation of the immune system can cause a dangerously high fever and damage internal organs, the lungs in particular. It is believed that during the 1918 Spanish flu epidemic, the death rate was extremely high because the virus somehow triggered a cytokine storm.</p>
<p>But, to address the question, no, there is no evidence of a cytokine storm in people who contracted swine flu. Their symptoms are similar to seasonal influenza – sudden high fever, cough, and breathing problems in severe cases.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>From sunshine to sickness in three short days; Canadians who caught the flu in Mexico at first thought they were just a bit under the weather. Then the real symptoms kicked in</b>

<p>PORT PERRY, ONT. and VANCOUVER -- Sunshine, beaches, cocktails and a language barrier left three Port Perry, Ont., residents vacationing in Cancun blithely unaware they were near ground zero of an emerging flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Until modern technology intervened.</p>
<p>The girls were three days into their holiday, each beginning to run a fever, when text messages home were answered with cautions about “swine flu.”</p>
<p>Then their symptoms, the fever, shivers, aches and coughing, became hard to dismiss.</p>
<p>Ryan Windsor, a restaurant manager in Richmond, B.C., thought he'd had too much sun.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old Mr. Windsor was nearing the end of a one-week trip to Cancun when he woke up feeling tired and a bit dizzy, as if his legs were not quite solidly beneath him.</p>
<p>Aside from a recent trip to Mexico, what many of the 34 Canadians who recently contracted influenza A (H1N1) have in common is that at first they just thought they were a bit under the weather.</p>
<p>After only a few days, the symptoms the Port Perry girls experienced had subsided, but an outbreak of a mysterious contagion can sure put a damper on a vacation.</p>
<p>Last Friday, upon their return to Canada, the girls went straight from Pearson International Airport to a hospital in Port Perry.</p>
<p>“They did chest X-rays and took some nose swabs, and then they said, ‘Everything's okay, you can go home,'” said Barb Stevenson, the mother of one of the infected girls, Justine Stevenson, 21.</p>
<p>“I fully expected they would keep them in quarantine because they had come from Mexico and they were sick.”</p>
<p>On Monday it was confirmed the girls had contracted influenza A. On Tuesday it was confirmed that they were infected with the H1N1 strain, and only then did a quarantine begin.</p>
<p>But the girls had already come into contact with dozens of friends and relatives since their return from Mexico.</p>
<p>Ms. Stevenson was especially concerned because she runs a daycare service out of her home.</p>
<p>“They should have told them right away to stay in quarantine,” she said.</p>
<p>Her daughter has been home for nearly a week, and thankfully, neither she nor any of the children in her care have experienced any flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>When Mr. Windsor's symptoms began, he decided to take the last day of his vacation to rest in the shade.</p>
<p>Flying home to Vancouver the next day, his skin felt hot to the touch but he couldn't get warm, despite hot chocolate, extra blankets and a hot water bottle provided to him on the plane.</p>
<p>Once he was home, the shakes and chills continued, compounded by a bad cough, stomach cramps and diarrhea. Breathing felt like a chore.</p>
<p>“It was everything all at once,” Mr. Windsor said yesterday in a telephone interview. “All the washroom stuff kicked in; I'd never experienced anything like that before.”</p>
<p>That night – Thursday, April 23 – Mr. Windsor called his mother, who told him about swine-flu reports and urged him to go to the hospital. He did so the next day, when he was bustled into an isolation room for tests and treatment.</p>
<p>Mr. Windsor, who's been praised by B.C. authorities for staying away from work and limiting his contact with other people – his roommate is currently staying elsewhere – is recovering at home, gradually regaining his appetite and venturing outside yesterday for some time in the sun.</p>
<p>He says he'd go back to Mexico, but “once all of this is over.”</p>

<p>It appears the world's most popular search engine discovered the swine flu outbreak in Mexico almost a week before most of the world did.</p>
<p>The only problem is, no one was paying attention.</p>
<p>For months, <span class="companylink">Google</span> has been tracking and releasing data on the number of U.S.-based flu-related queries made to the search engine. The theory is that when people get sick, they go online to search for information. Since tracking those queries provides a near-real-time picture of how many people are sick, the data can spot outbreaks more quickly than conventional methods.</p>
<p>This week, <span class="companylink">Google</span> released data on the number of flu-related Web queries made by users in Mexico. The data shows a sharp spike in the number of queries, especially in Mexico City, beginning early in the week of April 19. By the end of that week, Mexican health officials had sounded the alarm and swine flu had become a global concern.</p>
<p>But while the data was there, no one knew to look for it until after the outbreak became major news, at which point the head start it could have given health officials was gone.</p>
<p>Last week, the CDC asked <span class="companylink">Google</span> to look back at its search queries from Mexico. The search engine released the data to the public on Wednesday.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Google</span> plans to continue updating its Mexican flu estimates and monitor the situation in the U.S. However, the search engine's models must also filter out the onslaught of flu-related queries now being made by healthy people looking for information about what has become a global crisis.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO and OTTAWA -- Provinces began to release their stockpiles of influenza treatments and a British Columbia school was the first in Canada to close its doors yesterday as the country braced for the potential onslaught of a global pandemic.</p>
<p>“We are all very concerned about the situation,” Prime Minister Stephen Harper told reporters in his first public comments on the disease that has placed international health authorities on high alert.</p>
<p>“At the same time, people should rest assured that governments around the world are responding to this in an appropriate and co-ordinated way. … I believe we are doing what is necessary at the moment but this is a serious situation.”</p>
<p>There were 15 new confirmed cases across Canada yesterday: five in B.C., four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario, and Quebec recorded its first. They bring the total number of diagnosed cases of the H1N1 virus in this country to 34, but doctors say many more people are suspected of having the disease.</p>
<p>Beairsto Elementary, a French-immersion school in Vernon, B.C., with 540 children, is being closed for a week after one of its students returned from Mexico, developed mild symptoms, and was confirmed as one of the flu cases in the province.</p>
<p>Bob Peacock, the school superintendent for the district, said the girl went to the doctor and did not show up for school yesterday. The health unit contacted the board, which then closed the school at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Mr. Peacock expressed concern. “It's like head lice. As soon as you mention head lice everybody starts to scratch their head. When there's talk about swine flu and symptoms, you naturally start looking at folks differently when they cough,” he said.</p>
<p>Across Canada, a pandemic response was being ramped up yesterday after the World Health Organization declared on Wednesday that there were strong signals of an imminent pandemic.</p>
<p>Unlike many other countries, Canada has what officials say are sufficient stockpiles of antiviral drugs to treat those who become ill and to bolster the immunity of people at risk.</p>
<p>The national antiviral stockpile of 55 million doses, made up of both Tamiflu and Relenza, has been distributed to provinces and territories on a per-capita basis and is being stored in undisclosed secure sites across the country. There are additional amounts being held in a national emergency stockpile to be used as backup.</p>
<p>“We are ensuring that the national antiviral stockpile can be mobilized as needed,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, told reporters yesterday. It is up to each province to decide how, and to whom, it will be released.</p>
<p>Health officials in Saskatchewan began on Wednesday to distribute some of its stockpile of drugs to the province's regional health authorities and pharmacies.</p>
<p>There are no confirmed cases in that province, but “we did have some cases that were presenting with symptoms, so as we're moving along, physicians do have the authority to prescribe,” said Karen Hill, a spokeswoman for the provincial Ministry of Health .</p>
<p>Other provinces have decided not to ship the drug at this time. Neither Ontario nor Manitoba, for instance, have moved their stockpiles, but both provinces say pharmacies within their jurisdictions have supplies.</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia, where eight children have come down with the disease, the stockpile has also not been distributed. But students at King's-Edgehill School in Windsor, which the children attended, have been treated.</p>
<p>Other schools and school boards across the country have started to look at ways to keep their students safe.</p>
<p>In Victoria, daily notices are being sent to parents about the flu situation and students are reminded to practise proper hygiene. The board brought in extra custodial staff to make sure door knobs, faucets and other heavily used items are kept clean. Hand sanitizers have been ordered for classrooms that don't have sinks.</p>
<p>“We certainly don't want them [students] panicked in any way. But we want them to be informed,” said John Gaiptman, superintendent of schools for the Greater Victoria School District.</p>
<p>Health-care facilities are also stepping up their flu watch.</p>
<p>In many Toronto-area hospitals, for instance, triage nurses working in the emergency departments are wearing N95 respiratory masks. Posters at the doors of hospitals tell patients and visitors coming in with a new or worsening cough, fever or shortness of breath to identify themselves immediately to the triage nurse so they can be given a surgical mask</p>
<p>On a national level, Health Canada is planning to roll out a new awareness campaign today to alert Canadians to the symptoms of the new influenza and the precautions that should be taken.</p>
<p>The government has begun discussions with GlaxoSmithKline Inc., the pharmaceutical company that is under contract to make a vaccine should one be necessary.</p>
<p>Frank Plummer, scientific director of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said yesterday that vaccine production is at a very early stage. The seed stock has been developed and scientists are now trying to grow it and determine its effectiveness.</p>
<p>The big difference between an ordinary influenza and a pandemic, said Dr. Butler-Jones, is not the severity of the disease but the numbers of people who could become ill.</p>
<p>According to Canada's Pandemic Influenza Plan, a federal plan on how to deal with wide-scale national outbreaks, a pandemic flu could kill between 11,000 and 58,000 Canadians in a period of about six to eight weeks. The disease could also result in the hospitalization of between 35,000 and 138,000 people and leave between 4.5 million and 10.6 million others too sick to work, which could have a devastating impact on the economy.</p>
<p>While the disease is mild at this point, Dr. Butler-Jones said no one can tell what the future will bring. Previous pandemics have appeared to die out with the approach of summer and then recurred with a vengeance with the return of cold weather.</p>
<p>“And that's why all of this preparation is needed, not only for today but to make sure that we don't have a bigger problem when and if it comes back in October or November,” he said.</p>
<p>In Mexico, where there were 260 confirmed cases and 12 confirmed deaths as of yesterday, citizens have been urged to stay home until Tuesday in hopes of containing the outbreak.</p>
<p>“There is no safer place to protect yourself against catching swine flu than in your house,” Mexican President Felipe Calderon said in a televised address Wednesday night.</p>

</p>
<p>With reports from Gloria Galloway in Ottawa and The Canadian Press -- In search of a catchy brand palatable to politicians, scientists, headline writers and pig farmers everywhere, the World Health Organization yesterday took a new look at an age-old question: Would that which we call swine flu, by any other name, smell so foul?</p>
<p>The agency rechristened the so-called swine flu as a sideline battle brewed, not over the potential pandemic, but what to call it. “Swine flu” is out, the WHO said, so as to clear that big stumbling block it poses – creating a pork backlash even though a human can't get the flu by eating pork.</p>
<p>But the new name – “influenza A (H1N1)” – hardly rolls off the tongue, and didn't immediately catch on. Prime Minister Stephen Harper took a freestyle approach, going with “Mexican flu” repeatedly yesterday, while pig farmers facing plummeting pork sales pushed for “North American flu.” Comedian Stephen Colbert joked that pig farmers would rather just call it “bird flu.”</p>
<p>Scientists, meanwhile, raised a point of objection – that the name influenza A H1N1 is already taken, by the virus that caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, and still exists today as a type of common flu.</p>
<p>“That's nuts,” said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy, when told the new name. “They've got to do something to distinguish it from the seasonal flu.”</p>
<p>But Canada's top public health official said the country will stick with the WHO, even if Mr. Harper missed the memo, to lessen the confusion over the deadly flu strain.</p>
<p>“From this time we will be referring to this human virus as the H1N1 flu virus to make it very clear that this disease is not spread from pigs, or from either pork or pork products,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, told reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based WHO had stood by “swine flu” as late as Wednesday before relenting. The move also came after Egypt slaughtered 300,000 pigs, which experts called unnecessary.</p>
<p>“Rather than calling this swine flu … we're going to stick with the technical scientific name H1N1 influenza A,” WHO spokesman Dick Thompson said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper's choice to call it the Mexican flu may have raised the ire of officials in that country, who are quick to point out the flu is now worldwide.</p>
<p>“It's pointless to try to blame a country, a whole country, for the dissemination of a virus, you know?” said Alberto Lozano, a spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Ottawa, who tiptoeing around the issue, praised Canada's response and said stopping the virus, whatever its name, is the priority.</p>
<p>“For the Mexican government, the official name is A H1N1.”</p>
<p>Swine flu got its name because it is thought to have been caused by a new swine influenza virus that is a hybrid of a number of pig, bird and human flu viruses.</p>
<p>Scientists don't know when it jumped to humans, but the flu hasn't appeared to infect pigs.</p>
<p>The WHO has said pigs don't factor into the equation when investigating transmission patterns. Human-to-human transfer is thought to be spreading it.</p>
<p>As such, public health officials need a catchy name that's easy to remember and doesn't assign blame to an animal or region. But scientists, who typically name influenzas after the place where they are first discovered, prefer the old name.</p>
<p>“It's called swine flu because of what is known and knowable about the virus,” said Karl Johnson, former head of special pathogens at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>“It ought to be called ‘swine H1N1 2009,'” Dr. Johnson said. “That's where I would keep it, because it tells the truth.”</p>

<p>Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, writing in the Telegraph, believes that investors are being far too relaxed about the swine flu outbreak – even as the World Health Organization moves closer to declaring the outbreak a global pandemic, the first since 1968.</p>
<p>The World Bank has estimated that an outbreak as serious as the 1918 Spanish flu would cost the global economy a total of $3-trillion (U.S.) and knock 4.8 per cent from global gross domestic product.</p>
<p>Mr. Evans-Pritchard acknowledges that these are arbitrary telephone book numbers, but even lesser losses would provide another deflationary shock to the economy and would probably ruin half of the global banking system.</p>
<p>“It is too frightful to think about,” he said. “That perhaps is why investors are doing exactly that: refusing to think about.”</p>
<p>Since the swine flu outbreak grabbed global attention – let's call it Monday – the S&P 500 has risen a total of 2.2 per cent. Over the past two days, including Thursday, it has risen 3.5 per cent. On Thursday, major European indexes were up more than 2 per cent and Japan's Nikkei 225 surged 3.9 per cent – evidently ignoring the potential devastation of a pandemic in favour of upbeat economic and earnings news from the United States.</p>
<p>Mr. Evans-Pritchard said he has been deluged by reports from analysts and economists suggesting that the swine flu's threat to the global economy is minor because the SARS epidemic in 2003 proved that outbreaks can be contained.</p>
<p>“This is a misreading of the threat we face,” he said. “SARS is a coronavirus. It is extremely hard to catch. Just 8,000 people were infected worldwide during the entire epidemic. Today's H1N1 outbreak is an influenza virus, which is far more contagious.”</p>
<p>He noted that Rob Carnell, chief economist at ING, is one of the exceptions. In a note, Mr. Carnell said: “We believe fear of infection will lead to drastically altered behaviour. It may be that swine flu does not tip the human fear scale sufficiently, but if it did, with the economy already in tatters, the results could be catastrophic.”</p>

<p>I got a chuckle from Margaret Wente's saying yesterday that the pandemic story exploded in the mass (or mass hysteria) media because it was time to change the subject from the economy. Then I gasped: OMG – what if it shifted not from tedium but paralysis? Right now, there's far more reason to panic about the economy than over a new flu. This recession emerged from a recent strain that's mutating, contagious and has no known cure. What if EGD (economic globalization disease) is the real pandemic?</p>
<p>Canada's economy was one of the first to fall victim to this new virus back in the mists of 1988, with the U.S.-Canada free-trade agreement, after the U.S. failed to make more comprehensive deals it had targeted. It fell back on a gradual strategy, and Canada was injected as an early test case. We were told our economy would be healthier, as in wealthier, with no annoying side effects on cultural or social programs. This proved false. Unemployment insurance, for instance, which used to help more than 80 per cent of the jobless through hard times, now covers well under 50 per cent.</p>
<p>The chief impact, though, was on the nature of work. Manufacturing, the economy's backbone, started to bleed whole factories to the southern United States. Under subsequent outbreaks, such as NAFTA, they spread to Mexico, then China and beyond, as the illness advanced. The jobs that remained were less rewarding, as workers and unions succumbed to threats to relocate. Many who lost out moved to “service” jobs, at <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> or <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span>.</p>
<p>As the disease progressed through the main, er, body of working Canadians, they had less to spend. Yet, their economic role was now mainly to buy what had been made elsewhere. They'd become primarily consumers, rather than producers. To fulfill this responsibility, they resorted to ever greater debt. Meanwhile, the economic boss organs, which used to focus on industry, mutated toward finance, devising ever more arcane methods to lend and borrow. Eventually, any system collapses under this kind of economic vacuity, which creates less that's real, yet requires real stuff to sustain it.</p>
<p>We are now at a level five alert, announced Wednesday, in the spread of the global economic disaster. No, wait, that was actually the global flu classification system, newly activated, though it also sounds a lot like the old terror alert systems, except those were by colours. It gets confusing. I kind of expect CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta to offer himself for an injection of swine flu, the way Fox News' Sean Hannity said he was willing to try waterboarding.</p>
<p>But back to the Canadian test case. It's not clear there's a vaccine for this. Once you unwind a system's healthy elements, they're hard to replace. You've made the body vulnerable, and pumping in some money and stimulus may just mask the symptoms while the next bout of fever gathers strength. Take Michael Ignatieff, who will be installed as Liberal leader in Vancouver tomorrow. He's been touring Western Canada asking audiences if they've noticed where the new economic centre of the country is. Right here – in the West! he says with the gusto of the boy who stuck in his thumb and pulled out a plum.</p>
<p>But this may not be such great news. It was the combination of manufacturing in Ontario and Quebec, with a strong resource and farming economy elsewhere, that Canadian prosperity was based on. Without that mix, or by trying to substitute finance for manufacturing, with the ruinous results now on us, we risk going from developed to underdeveloped status. Maybe we should try a balanced economy, without a centre, avoiding the grievance and aggravation that leads to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the swine flu extravaganza may not be evasion by metaphor. It's possible we've acquired two unprecedented diseases – one medical, one economic – and neither has any known cure.</p>

</p>
<p>The scares over bird flu since 1997 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 have spurred research into the economic costs of pandemics. Studies paint a grim picture of what swine flu could mean for the world economy.</p>
<p>For example, World Bank economists estimated last year that a pandemic with death rates similar to those in the Spanish flu that swept the world in 1918-19 could shrink global GDP by 4.8 per cent.</p>
<p>Although such research can help to identify the economic effects of swine flu, global recession means that some of the mechanisms it describes are already at work. The recession means, perhaps counterintuitively, that the incremental economic effect of a pandemic may be less dramatic than it would be in normal times.</p>
<p>Economists argue that a pandemic would affect both global demand and global supply, but that the first of these is particularly vulnerable to the uncertainty and fear surrounding even the possibility of widespread disease. That would cause consumer spending to fall and businesses to put investment plans on hold.</p>
<p>Asia's experience with SARS is a guide. The outbreak caused a sharp drop in private consumption in the economies it affected. People avoided going out -- as they are doing in Mexico. On Wednesday, the country's president, Felipe Calderon, announced a national suspension of non-essential activities over the next five days.</p>
<p>The canceling of sporting events and concerts, the closing of bars and nightclubs, and people's propensity to stay inside had already cost Mexico City's service and retail industries $55 million a day from April 24, when authorities first closed schools. That sum was expected to double after a ban on restaurants seating customers.</p>
<p>Financial markets have reacted sharply: the peso has fallen by 5.5 percent against the dollar since the emergency began.</p>
<p>Mexico's finance minister, Agustin Carstens, has said that he expects the economic cost to be 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of GDP, based on Asian precedents. Luis Flores, an economist at IXE, a bank, reckons that the government's budget deficit could increase by 0.7 per cent of GDP.</p>
<p>This outbreak has happened when, worldwide, consumer confidence is low. So any further drops in demand because of a swine-flu pandemic may be smaller than those caused by SARS, when airline-passenger arrivals in Hong Kong fell by nearly two-thirds in a month.</p>
<p>But a pandemic would dent hopes of a rapid recovery from recession, by providing yet another reason for gloom to continue.</p>
<p>The uncertainty caused by a pandemic could hit investment, too. Risk premiums for countries affected by the pandemic might rise. And worries about safety, justified or not, pose risks to trade.</p>
<p>Already, China has banned Mexican pork, though there is no evidence to suggest that meat spreads flu viruses. World trade is already plummeting. Widespread reactions of this sort could steepen its dive.</p>
<p>The potential supply-side effects of a pandemic come mainly because people fall ill or die. Infected people cannot work, and others must take time off to care for them. This has an immediate effect on the size of the labor force, but with consequences that last many years.</p>
<p>The future output of those who die is lost. That is especially important when people of working age are taken. The worst economic consequences of AIDS have come from death and sickness among young adults.</p>
<p>The worldwide costs from deaths and hospitalization are hard to calculate in the absence of information about medical costs in each country. However, Martin Meltzer, Nancy Cox and Keiji Fukuda, now deputy director-general of the World Health Organization, did the sums for America in a paper in 1999.</p>
<p>They found that a pandemic affecting 15 to 35 per cent of the population would have cost between $71.3 billion and $166.5 billion (in 1999 dollars).</p>
<p>The bulk of this would come from forgoing all that the sick and the dead would have produced. In other words, it is an estimate of the effect on the potential output of the American economy.</p>
<p>Because of the global slump, many more people are already out of work than in normal times. This probably means that the immediate cost of additional losses in output would be smaller than in the estimates made by Meltzer, Cox and Fukuda.</p>
<p>Several studies have put all this together to estimate the overall impact of a pandemic on economic growth. In 2006 Warwick McKibbin and Alexandra Sidorenko found in a study for the Lowy Institute for International Policy in Sydney that even a mild pandemic could shave 0.8 per cent off world GDP. For the worst possibility they considered, the drop would be a staggering 12.6 per cent.</p>
<p>They reckon a pandemic similar to the one that began in 1918 would reduce growth in the American economy by three percentage points and in Japan by 8.3 points.</p>
<p>Roughly comparable numbers emerge from a study by economists at America's Congressional Budget Office, which found that a Spanish-flu-like pandemic would lower real GDP growth in America by about five points. Even a milder episode would lead to a 1.5-point drop.</p>
<p>These are large declines. The CBO notes that a severe pandemic would be like a typical post-war recession. As it happens, the worries about swine flu come when the world is already in its worst slump since the war. That would dampen the economic effects of a pandemic. But if a pandemic does occur, this would be small comfort indeed.</p>

<p>The U.S. and Canadian government bond markets this week finally started to play catch-up with the buoyant stock markets, signalling a growing belief that the global economy is stabilizing.</p>
<p>The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries smashed through the 3 per cent barrier this week as sellers dumped bonds, sending yields climbing to almost 3.15 per cent before ending yesterday at 3.13 per cent.</p>
<p>“There were key levels in both Canada and the United States that were broken,” said Mark Chandler, a fixed-income strategist for <span class="companylink">RBC Dominion Securities Inc</span>. Canadian rates also climbed to 3.1 per cent yesterday.</p>
<p>Critical forces are at work that are leading to the sharp drop in bond prices, Mr. Chandler said. First, investors are showing a greater appetite for riskier investments. Secondly, the U.S. Treasury is expected to continue to issue huge supplies of bonds to finance the government's deficit.</p>
<p>And just as important was this week's statement by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board that set a slightly more optimistic tone about the economy. The Fed also gave no indication that it was determined to hold interest rates down under its quantitative easing program in which it buys Treasuries to support bond prices to keep rates low.</p>
<p>“It's a bit of a subtle point, but I don't think the Fed was strongly inclined to support a certain [interest rate] level,” Mr. Chandler said.</p>
<p>The burst of optimism that has finally hit the bond markets comes as interest rate players face a fairly challenging mix of factors, said Stewart Hall, a currency and fixed-income strategist for <span class="companylink">HSBC Securities Canada Inc</span>. Questions remain about the health of the economy, while Treasury auctions – $101-billion (U.S.) this week and $71-billion next week – remain at high levels.</p>
<p>“Treasury buybacks are being swamped by the onset of new supply,” Mr. Hall said. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries has climbed nearly half a percentage point this month. “Financial markets have pushed aside concerns over the [swine flu] pandemic and have embraced equities,” he said.</p>
<p>The pickup in financing activity in bond markets and the significant narrowing of interest rate spreads indicate the financial markets are recovering, Mr. Hall said. “My inclination is that the Fed is not as concerned about 10-year Treasury yields as they are in the interest rate spreads.”</p>
<p>But look for continued volatility, Mr. Hall added. “We are just looking at a thin slice of the picture this week,” he said. “The story has a tendency to swing between optimism and pessimism.”</p>
<p>What are the expectations?</p>
<p>A flood of economic data scheduled for release today – factory orders, the Institute of Supply Management's manufacturing index, vehicle sales and the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey – are expected to show a depressed economy, but that the slowdown is easing.</p>
<p>The question facing bond traders is just how hands-off will the Fed be if interest rates climb too high?</p>
<p>“They are willing to let yields rise modestly,” said RBC's Mr. Chandler. The rally in the equity markets, the narrowing of credit spreads in the financial markets and the rise in asset prices are all indicative of an improving economy, he said.</p>
<p>However, if government bond yields rise too much and the economy doesn't improve, that would be a problem. “They [the Fed] don't want higher costs for businesses or the consumer,” he said. “They are trying to keep them [interest costs] contained.”</p>

<p>Closing a school on the basis of a single confirmed case of swine flu is a strong but sensible approach to containing a disease that remains highly unpredictable. The United States has taken that approach, and more than 100 school districts have closed at least some schools; they are to remain closed for a week or more. Canada has no such policy. What is it that Canada knows that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control does not?</p>
<p>By the time a child is diagnosed with swine flu, he or she may have had days to spread it to others. Those other children without visible symptoms may spread it to still more children. To ask other children to remain in school in such a situation is to risk exposing them to infection. Although the infection has not yet proved deadly outside Mexico, with the exception of a 23-month-old boy in Texas, “it is important for all of us to understand that flu viruses … are extremely unpredictable,” Anne Schuchat, of the CDC, told a House committee yesterday. The flu's severity will probably change, she said.</p>
<p>Canada boasts of its preparedness for a pandemic (“We are among the most prepared in the world,” David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer for Canada, said yesterday), but many of its guidelines are quite general. The Public Health Agency of Canada says on its website that school closures “under certain circumstances … may be advisable.” Dr. Butler-Jones says officials are leery of closings because a certain control can be exercised in a school; young people who aren't in school may simply head off to the mall. Control? That seems just hubris.</p>
<p>The schools' ability to “control” the flu is an illusion. How do they exert control? Through information, says Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's medical officer of health. Children would be reminded to sneeze or cough into their sleeves, and stay home if they are ill. Some control.</p>
<p>So what are the circumstances that justify closings in Canada? The guidelines at federal, provincial and local levels call for school closures when transmission is widespread and the influenza is severe, Dr. McKeown says. But at that point, it's too late.</p>
<p>The disruption involved in school closings has to be balanced against the health benefits, Dr. McKeown said. No doubt the disruption would be large, and President Barack Obama, in supporting school closings on CDC advice, urged businesses and parents to develop contingency plans. Schools not only teach but feed children, and look after them after school, and provide day care to younger children. Still, to try to “balance” disruption and health benefits is to make a calculated bet that the illness will not prove deadly in Canada. That is a dangerous bet for Canada to make.</p>
<p>Public-health officials in Canada may wish to keep the schools open, but parents will pull their children out anyway, as soon as the disease reaches their schools. Canadian public-health officials need to move past the generalities and the self-praise, and put their heads together on this problem.</p>

<p>Calgary -- • While your article The Boy At Swine Flu's Ground Zero (April 29) didn't directly blame five-year-old Edgar Hernandez, it certainly singled him out in the hunt for the flu's origin. That's disgusting. What about privacy? Patients' names should not be revealed, particularly children's.</p>
<p>How would The Globe's editors like it if a picture of one of their sons was used by a national newspaper as the face of a disease?</p>
