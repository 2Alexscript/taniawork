<p>There have been no new swine flu cases in the Windsor-Essex region since the first week of May, according to medical officer of health, Dr. Allen Heimann. The five local confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus were all mild and were young people in their 20s who had travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>Heimann said the health unit will continue to follow up on any reports in the community but it appears that the number of new cases is decreasing across the province and the country.</p>

<p>Here we go again, ladies and gentlemen, another day, another crisis. It seems to me that I can't open a paper, turn on the TV or even listen to the radio without hearing about something else that could be the "end as we know it."</p>
<p>With swine flu, terrorists, war and a recession that seems to have no end in sight, most people, including myself, really do believe that this is the end. If not, we might as well sit in a dark corner with a bag over our heads for the rest of our lives because it's never going to get better. It is clear the world is worried about tomorrow. What we used to call a winter wonderland, has turned into a snow day where we are told not to go out in case the evil three centimetres of snow will mug us. But, the question I have for the reader is, is the world more dangerous, or are we just more informed?</p>
<p>It is quite possible that these things were happening all the time, way back in the day and, sure, the news of the story would hit our parts by word of mouth in a month or two.</p>
<p>I say to the reader, relax, this is still the world you remember. The days where Saturday morning was worth getting up for cartoons or the days where a BB gun was a good gift. We are still there, just now we are more scared of what could be, rather then what is.</p>

<p>The H1N1 virus or "swine flu" has been generating much media coverage. While much of the news has focused on whether there is a miraculous vaccine that could be developed to treat pandemic flu, the reality is that infection control will likely be the cornerstone of any early prevention efforts -- and front-line health workers, and the unions that represent them, have a key role to play in making this occur.</p>
<p>The SARS outbreak in 2003 showed us that front-line health workers bear the brunt of any serious epidemic. Workers had high infection rates and were overrepresented in the total number of deaths due to SARS. As an independent commission later agreed, the Province of Ontario did not have the processes or structures in place to adequately handle an outbreak and then prematurely relaxed infection control measures, despite concerns raised by health workers and their unions, resulting in a second wave of the outbreak. Public and worker safety were compromised repeatedly.</p>
<p>Six years later we find ourselves in a seemingly similar situation. It has been reported that hospital workers in Toronto have contracted the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>It strikes a nerve with other hospital workers. They understand they have a higher risk of contracting an illness than members of the general population and think the province should take careful review of the Campbell Commission recommendations to adequately protect our front-line health care practitioners. Doing so would reveal that our preparedness to prevent a SARS-like situation has not significantly improved. The public and our health care workers continue to be at risk.</p>
<p>One of Campbell's recommendations was to improve consultation and co-ordination among government, health facilities, workers and their unions representing them. Campbell noted that front-line health care workers and their representatives were on the cutting edge of what was happening and had the most to offer in terms of suggestions about what was and wasn't working for battling the outbreak. Nonetheless, workers were not brought into the consultative circle.</p>
<p>Out of a tragic and unfortunate situation, Ontario should have at least learned important lessons to prevent this from happening again. However it is our experience that little has changed. Information needs to be shared and collaborated on in the best interest of health workers and the general public.</p>
<p>The government of Ontario consistently lacks enforcement of rules, laws and regulations; the Campbell commission is just one example. To protect the public and our health care workers the government must:</p>
<p>1. Establish direct lines of communication with workers and their unions to receive timely and accurate reports of the situation and concerns.</p>
<p>2. Ensure that the Ministry of Labour has a clear mandate to proactively protect workers and that ministry laws are enforced.</p>
<p>If our health care workers get sick due to lax regulations we could have another travel ban imposed on Toronto by the WHO. Would that help our struggling economy?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Global response faulted; Swine flu. ICAO seeks harmonization</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>

<p>Poor communication between airports and public health authorities hampered the initial response to the H1N1 pandemic flu threat, a top official with the Montreal-based International Civil Aviation Organization charged yesterday.</p>
<p>Anthony Evans, chief of aviation medicine at ICAO, said he "didn't want to name names," but he gave a number of examples of a lack of co-ordination.</p>
<p>Different countries used different systems to keep track of passengers who might have been exposed to H1N1, he noted. The World Health Organization and ICAO have a standard system of "tracing" such passengers.</p>
<p>Air travellers are required to fill out a "public-health passenger locator card" that is then used by the WHO for surveillance of cases. But some airlines didn't use the WHO-ICAO system, Evans said.</p>
<p>Air travellers who might have been exposed to a pathogen like H1N1 must also fill out a "health declaration card," checking off a number of symptoms. Again, some airlines didn't use those cards.</p>
<p>Some pilots were left with the responsibility of notifying their destination airports they had passengers suspected of contracting H1N1. Evans said ICAO recommends air-traffic controllers be given the task of notifying airports.</p>
<p>"To try to get different organizations to talk and work closely together - this is something that is rather new," Evans told reporters. Indeed, the ICAO announced yesterday that it has "intensified efforts to assist member states in developing effective and globally harmonized national contingency plans."</p>
<p>Evans acknowledged that in the first days after the discovery of H1N1, global air travel did propagate the spread of the virus beyond Mexico. "The number of cases, at least in the early stages, were quite well correlated with the (routes) out of the country. So people flying from Mexico to the United States, as you might expect, and (to) Canada, Spain - these are the countries where the most number of cases have been found."</p>
<p>Still, he argued against restricting air travel, especially to Mexico. Yesterday, ICAO adopted a resolution urging all 190 member states not to impose such restrictions.</p>
<p>"Restricting air travel is not going to be effective at preventing the spread of the disease," he said. "That's the bottom line. And even if it had some minor effects, the impact to travel and trade would be disproportionately great."</p>
<p>Brian Ward, an infectious diseases expert at the McGill University Health Centre, has said one in two people who have contracted H1N1 are symptom-free for a couple of days and therefore travel restrictions won't work on them.</p>

<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>814 words</div><div>21 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The couple strolled over to the bust of John Ducey to take in its likeness to Edmonton's Mr. Baseball.</p>
<p>"I'm so glad that it's out here now," said Peter Quily. "The last time we were here, we couldn't find this. It was tucked away somewhere.</p>
<p>"We didn't think he should have been pushed out of the picture right away." His wife, Duane, the daughter of the late legend, nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Duane Quily will take part in the opening ceremonies tonight when the Edmonton Capitals open the Golden Baseball League season against the Victoria Seals.</p>
<p>With Oilers owner Daryl Katz taking over the independent league franchise from the controversial Dan Orlich in February, it's a new start for the sport in Edmonton, and one that Quily is glad to see.</p>
<p>"I think this is wonderful that they are so enthuastic about starting up again," Duane said. "This used to be a really good baseball town." Quily, who was on hand for the final game at John Ducey Park in 1994 and the first game at Telus Field when the newly built ball park opened its doors in 1995, travelled from Vancouver Island for tonight's game.</p>
<p>"I really appreciated the fact they wanted to remember the past," Quily, 69, said Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Quily spent Tuesday night tossing balls on the front lawn of her retirement home in Qualicom Beach, B.C., getting her arm ready for the ceremonial first pitch.</p>
<p>"Her curveball is good, her slider is OK and she can still throw heat," said Peter, "but that knuckleball is getting a little rusty." Ducey died in 1983 at the age of 75 -- two years after the Triple-A Trappers played their first game in the river valley on the banks of the North Saskatchewan River.</p>
<p>Renfrew Park was soon renamed in honour of Ducey, who was heavily involved in local baseball as a player, umpire, manager, promoter and ambassador of the game over four decades, when he became known as the Rajah of Renfrew.</p>
<p>The Trappers, initially owned by Peter Pocklington, were eventually sold by the Edmonton Eskimos to a group that included Hall of Famer Nolan Ryan. The team was moved to Round Rock, Texas, following the 2004 Pacific Coast League season.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Cracker-Cats moved in and played in the Northern League for three years before switching to the Golden Baseball League last season.</p>

<p>COVERING ALL OF THE BASES</p>
<p>- Play ball: The Edmonton Capitals open their Golden Baseball League season at 7 p.m. tonight at Telus Field against the Victoria Seals. The four-game series will be followed by a three-game series against the Long Beach Armada that gets underway on Monday.</p>
<p>- At the wicket: General admission adult tickets are $9 while seats in reserved grandstand section cost $12.50. Youth and senior tickets are priced at $8 and $10, respectively. Tickets are available at Telus Field, through the team's website, and at <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span>.</p>
<p>- The league: The aim of the GBL is to develop professional independent minor league baseball in western North America. Now in its fifth season, the nine-team league is split into a South and North Division. The Capitals, Victoria Seals, Calgary Vipers, Chico Outlaws and Long</p>
<p>Beach are aligned in the North. The Tucson Toros, Yuma Scorpions, Orange County Flyers and St. George Pioneers are in the South Division, which lost the Tijuana Potros two weeks ago when the expansion franchise suspended operations in wake of the H1N1 virus scare. Victoria and Tucson are also expansion franchises this season.</p>
<p>- Name dropping: Former major league all-stars Phil Nevin (Orange County), Garry Templeton (Long Beach), Darrell Evans (Victoria) and former big league manager Tim Johnson (Tucson) are in the managerial ranks this season. Templeton is also a former Edmonton Trappers manager. On the field, former Japanese superstar Hideki Irabu has come out of retirement and will pitch for Long Beach, as will Jose Lima.</p>

<p>The number of worldwide swine flu infections surged past 10,000 on Wednesday as the epidemic gathered pace in the U.S. and the first case was recorded in Tokyo. The announcement in the Japanese capital that a 16-year-old high school girl had caught H1N1 on a trip to New York underlined the scale of the challenge to contain the virus which has now been recorded in 41 countries. The number of confirmed swine flu cases now stands at 10,243 and the number of dead at 80.</p>

<p>Ottawa public-health officials confirmed Wednesday there are more cases of the new H1N1 influenza A virus in the city, bringing the total number of cases to 13.</p>
<p>The laboratory-confirmed Ottawa cases so far involve nine males and four females with an age range of less than one year to 54 years, with a median age of 20.</p>
<p>The virus has been identified in both travellers to affected areas as well as people in Ottawa. Some of the people affected have experienced severe symptoms and were hospitalized. All patients are now recovering.</p>
<p>"Ottawa Public Health continues to respond to this constantly evolving situation," said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's Medical Officer of Health. "We expected community spread and the possibility of more severe disease in some individuals. We continue to maintain heightened surveillance measures and extensive communication with our community partners, while also expanding our focus to preventing community outbreaks."</p>

</div><div>Helen Branswell   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Even among microbiologists and virologists, characterizing an influenza pandemic is a bit like, well, defining pornography.</p>
<p>"The old saying is: 'What's the definition of a pandemic strain?' Well, you can't really be sure but you'll know when you see one,''' says Dr. Walt Dowdle, a longtime head of the influenza laboratories at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, now retired from that post.</p>
<p>That may have seemed a truism at one point. But with the current outbreak of H1N1 flu, it may not seem so anymore.</p>
<p>Though the global count of confirmed cases has crested 10,000 in more than 40 countries on five continents, some politicians say they don't see a pandemic in the offing.</p>
<p>Some argued at the World Health Assembly in Geneva over whether the World Health Organization should rewrite the definition of a pandemic in ways that would exclude this virus. A number -- among them several affluent countries with antiviral stockpiles and pandemic vaccine contracts -- insisted the lack of severity associated with this new strain of flu means it doesn't merit the name.</p>
<p>The job of defining what constitutes a pandemic belongs to scientists, not politicians. But even scientists have divergent views about what is unfolding with the new H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"I think it is a pandemic already,'' says Dr. Allison McGeer, an influenza expert at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, which this week admitted two H1N1 patients. Yesterday, Ontario's confirmed case count jumped 45 per cent, to 272 from 187.</p>
<p>But Dr. Peter Palese, head of microbiology at Manhattan's Mt. Sinai School of Medicine, offers a differing opinion.</p>
<p>"In the past we talked about a 1918 pandemic, a 1957 and a 1968. And if you use it in that sense, in the classical sense of serious pandemic, then obviously (with) the H1N1, the name is not justified.''</p>
<p>After years of fearing the next pandemic would be triggered by the dangerous H5N1 avian flu virus with its 60 per cent case fatality rate, flu scientists were as taken aback as everyone else by the out-of-left-field emergence of this H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>It's an H1N1 virus, meaning it bears hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N) proteins on its surface that are distant relatives of those found on a human flu strain -- also called H1N1 -- that has been circulating for most of the last century.</p>
<p>It used to be thought that to cause a pandemic, a virus with a new hemagglutinin had to break out of nature.</p>
<p>This virus's hemagglutinin is not brand new -- but it is new enough to a wide segment of society to be able to infect a lot of people, especially young people, quite easily. But there are hints that exposure to H1N1s that circulated before 1957 may have given people in their 60s and older some protection against this new virus.</p>
<p>That fact, combined with the mildness of most cases and the low number of deaths, has some scientists wondering if this really is a pandemic strain in the making.</p>
<p>However, the WHO's criteria for a pandemic deliberately don't take severity into account, focusing instead on spread of a new virus to which a large portion of the population has no immunity. Severity, the WHO says, will likely vary from place to place, depending on the vulnerabilities of different populations. As well, it could change over time as a new virus spreads in waves around the world.</p>
<p>By the WHO's definition, a virus crosses the pandemic threshold when there is evidence of spread in the community in two WHO regions. With the virus galloping through schools in Japan, many observers believe the call is imminent -- if the WHO does not bow to pressure to change the rules.</p>
<p>Infectious diseases expert Dr. Michael Osterholm says the agency will hurt its own credibility if it bends scientific reality to political will.</p>
<p>"You know, you can decide not to call a house burning down a fire because it can only be a fire if it's so many acres big. But it's still a fire,'' says Osterholm, director of the University of Minnesota's Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy.</p>
<p>"I'm worried that if we get into this pandemic-not-pandemic debate, we're only going to see WHO suffer miserably in terms of their scientific integrity. That's what I think would be really unfortunate. Because we need to have a strong international public health agency whose credibility rests on its scientific word.''</p>
<p>One of the grand old men of flu agrees this virus will earn pandemic moniker, though he says H1N1 flu will probably go down in the annals of pandemics as a minor event.</p>
<p>"My prediction would be that it's going to be further transmitted and will become pandemic in the sense of global in distribution,'' says Dr. Edwin D. Kilbourne, who played key roles in the responses to the 1968 pandemic and the 1976 H1N1 flu incident.</p>
<p>"But it's not going to be a very important disease in terms of mortality,'' predicts Kilbourne, who lives in Madison, Conn. "And perhaps not even in terms of total morbidity.''</p>

<p>Ontario is confirming 85 new cases of H1N1 flu, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 272. Health officials say all of the cases reported to date, with the exception of two, are considered mild. In all, 138 males and 130 females in Ontario have contracted the virus. Meanwhile, a Canadian toddler became the fourth person to be diagnosed in Cuba with the H1N1 flu. The official Granma newspaper says the unidentified 14-month-old was hospitalized following his arrival from Toronto with his parents. Granma said the toddler is recovering.</p>

</div><div>VIRGINIA GALT    </div>

</p>
<p>Troy Manthorpe has always been frugal. But he took his thrift to a new level last week when he bought four pork rib roasts marked down to half price because swine flu fears had hampered sales.</p>
<p>Mr. Manthorpe picked up a Sicilian red from a discount rack at the liquor store for $10.99, marked down from $14.99, and saved 40 per cent on cod liver oil pills by buying the pharmacy's house brand rather than his usual name brand.</p>
<p>This year alone, he and his wife, Rosalyn Manthorpe, have also put $7,000 into Tax Free Savings Accounts, increasing their personal savings rate by about 20 per cent from last year.</p>
<p>The Coquitlam, B.C., couple are the face of what <span class="companylink">Toronto-Dominion Bank</span> economist Diana Petramala described yesterday as a noticeable “shift to thrift” as Canadians put more of their income away, boosting the personal savings rate.</p>
<p>“Households have constrained their spending considerably, and the savings rate rose to a six-year high of 4.7 per cent by the end of 2008,” Ms. Petramala said in a research report. “The combination of plunging stock markets, falling home prices, considerable job losses and sour consumer confidence has led consumers to tighten their purse strings.”</p>
<p>She predicted the personal savings rate will average around 6 to 7 per cent over the next five years, more than double the rate of the past five years.</p>
<p>Consumers will not stop spending, she said, but the rate of consumer spending will increase more slowly.</p>
<p>While retailers will have to fight harder for the consumer dollar, Ms. Petramala said the increase in savings rates, and a reduction in personal debt levels, “is not necessarily a bad thing” for the Canadian economy.</p>
<p>“We know that corporations have had a lot of hardships and it's going to be difficult for them to build up their savings. Consumers are going to have to pick up some of that slack [in savings].”</p>
<p>The personal savings rate fell as low as 1.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2007, as rising home values and robust stock market gains left Canadians feeling flush. Low interest rates and easy credit also made it easier for Canadians to indulge themselves, Ms. Petramala said.</p>
<p>“The wealth accumulation meant that households felt more financially sound, and it likely had a significant impact on the willingness to save less out of personal income. The downside is that it also left households more vulnerable to wealth corrections.”</p>
<p>While higher savings are seen as a positive trend for recession-wary consumers, their spending will also be key to helping to pull Canada out of the current slump.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Manthorpe, a business administrator at Manthorpe Law Offices in Surrey, B.C., where his wife has a legal practice, said he's always had a tendency to be thrifty. “But I think in the past year, I have been more thrifty than ever,” he said.</p>
<p>Similarly, in Regina, Ken Hodson's family expects to put between 10 and 12 per cent of household income into personal savings this year, up from roughly 3 to 4 per cent last year.</p>
<p>Summer vacation plans will be scaled back. And when Mr. Hodson and his wife eat out with their two young children, they keep it modest.</p>
<p>Mr. Hodson, a treasury analyst with <span class="companylink">SaskEnergy</span>, has a stable job and, unlike many Canadians, “we did not spend silly over the last several years.”</p>
<p>Still, he said, it seems prudent to set aside more for the family's future.</p>
<p>Ms. Petramala noted that Canadians were on a “shopping spree” in the five years that preceded the recession.</p>
<p>“Households bought new cars, fancy home furnishings, the latest fashions and ate out at their favourite restaurants,” she said. “… During this time, households overspent relative to their income, became overextended with debt and saved too little. Now, with the Canadian economy in recession, it is of no surprise the period characterized by consumerism has ended.”</p>

</p>
<p>TWO more Manitobans have tested positive for the H1N1 influenza virus that continues to infect thousands worldwide.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the province confirmed two more Manitobans tested positive for H1N1, bringing the total number of people infected to six. Both individuals live within the area of the Brandon Regional Health Authority and neither was hospitalized. The H1N1 flu virus has been in Manitoba for at least three weeks, and more cases of H1N1 are expected, the government said.</p>
<p>The news that the viral outbreak hasn't fizzled out in Manitoba came the same day as health officials across North America reported hundreds of additional cases. The Public Health Agency of Canada announced an additional 223 people tested positive for human swine flu, bringing the total number of laboratory-confirmed cases across the country to 719.</p>
<p>Scientists at the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab are in a rush to develop a vaccine "seed", so an inoculation that protects against the virus is ready to roll out when annual flu season hits in the fall. The concern is H1N1 could sputter out in the coming weeks and mutate before resurfacing as a stronger, deadlier flu in the fall.</p>
<p>Canadian lab officials have remained tight-lipped about their research and progress with the vaccine. Officials from the National Microbiology Lab did not respond to questions from the Free Press on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Daniel Jernigan, deputy director of influenza for the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said he expects vaccine candidates to be ready by the end of the month. Jernigan said U.S. scientists have sequenced the genes of about 500 viruses and have not seen any early signs H1N1 has mutated.</p>
<p>Localized outbreaks have erupted across the U.S. and areas in Arizona, California, New York, Texas and Wisconsin are among the hardest hit. Jernigan said 60 per cent of cases reported in the U.S. were in people from age five to 24, and scientists are investigating whether older adults exposed to H1N1 viruses before 1957 may have increased immunity. More than 10,000 confirmed cases of human swine flu have been reported in more than 41 countries.</p>

<p>BEIJING -- sars, hong kong - 2003swine flu, new york city - 2009One of Asia's best known virologists has accused the World Health Organization of weak leadership in its handling of the H1N1 outbreak, saying that when it is over and the scientific reviews begin, the public health institution will be "extremely embarrassed."</p>
<p>"People will be asking why this pandemic happened, why it spread so fast and did we have a chance to contain the virus in its early phase?" influenza specialist Guan Yi said in an interview.</p>
<p>Guan, a professor and virologist at the University of Hong Kong whose research is credited with preventing a second SARS outbreak, says the WHO did have a chance to contain the virus - in the United States - but he believes politics may have got in the way and the WHO hesitated.</p>
<p>The big fear in China - where the far deadlier H5N1 flu virus has been active - is that H5N1 could mix with H1N1. Although the chances of that happening are very low, scientists say it can't be ruled out. And if that were to happen the outcome would be nightmarish.</p>
<p>Guan also noted that when SARS - severe acute respiratory syndrome - broke out in Hong Kong and China in 2003 many countries "and the media" called for China to be isolated. Exit screening for departing passengers was recommended for Hong Kong, Guangdong province in southern China, Toronto, Singapore and Vietnam. And later a seven-week travel ban was slapped on Hong Kong and Guangdong.</p>
<p>"Have you heard anyone say, 'Let's isolate North America?'" Guan asked. "No. Not even in the media: no one makes this kind of comment. It's too sensitive. America is so powerful."</p>
<p>Guan later asked whether "a double standard" was being applied.</p>
<p>"Obviously for the WHO, when these guys are facing the U.S.A., they have difficulty in making a decision at all kinds of levels - because this is politics," Guan said.</p>
<p>Last night the WHO's spokesman in Geneva, Richard Thompson, refuted that perception.</p>
<p>"Outbreak response decisions were made only on public health considerations," he said in an email.</p>
<p>He did say, however, that "border closing and travel restrictions were also considered but rejected."</p>
<p>Today, the U.S. has the most confirmed H1N1 cases in the world - more than 5,700 - surpassing even the count in Mexico, where the virus was first reported. And the number of cases worldwide exceeds 10,000 and is climbing.</p>
<p>Guan also pointed out other countries can trace their viruses back to the U.S. - and some to Canada.</p>
<p>"If you check all the imported cases in Asia: Hong Kong, mainland China, Japan and Korea, in all these countries confirmed cases have a travelling history linked to the U.S.A. and also Canada," he said.</p>
<p>Canada, which recently lifted its travel advisory on Mexico, currently has more than 500 confirmed cases of the illness that scientists initially called swine flu.</p>
<p>"If we say that Mexico was the initial phase in transmitting the virus to other regions, the U.S. and Canada are the second wave," Guan said.</p>
<p>The WHO confirmed the first four cases of the virus in Japan, for example, are directly connected to Canada - three students and a teacher who returned home after visiting Oakville.</p>
<p>Guan insisted he wasn't criticizing his counterparts in the U.S. "I don't doubt their expertise," he said.</p>
<p>But he noted the countries with the highest number of cases in the world are also those with the closest ties and most contact with the U.S. To date, the top five countries with confirmed cases are: the U.S., Mexico, Canada, Japan and Britain.</p>
<p>In China, a nation of 1.3 billion people, the government continues to do everything it can to contain the disease. It has quarantined both suspected and confirmed cases, diligently tracked down carriers' contacts and launched a countrywide public information campaign. China has five confirmed cases, three of which have links to Canada, including a Beijing resident studying at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>The WHO's Thompson acknowledged the response to SARS was indeed different from the approach to this type of flu, but for good reason: SARS was new and scientists knew little about it.</p>
<p>But this time around, WHO scientists know a lot about influenza transmission and they know people can carry the virus long before they show detectable symptoms. Exit screening would not detect them.</p>
<p>Thompson also said regulations brought in after SARS made specific procedures mandatory for the WHO - including consultations with an expert emergency committee. On April 25, that committee decided not to raise the pandemic alert, but to cautiously call a public health emergency instead. It raised the alert to phase four - on a six-level scale - two days later.</p>
<p>On April 29, the WHO raised the alert to phase five, indicating a pandemic was imminent.</p>
<p>Guan believes the WHO should have raised the alert at the outset.</p>
<p>Thompson disagrees: "From a global health perspective, travel bans don't work, and certainly (not) when the disease is already very widespread."</p>

</p>
<p>Two Ontarians are now hospitalized with swine flu and other underlying health problems, including a Toronto man with congestive heart failure.</p>
<p>The provincial health ministry is revealing few details about the cases, but a source has said the 60-year-old Toronto man is on life support. He has been in Toronto Western Hospital for more than a week.</p>
<p>Officials revealed yesterday that the second individual is in hospital but said patient confidentiality prohibits them from revealing where.</p>
<p>There have been 272 confirmed cases of H1N1 in Ontario, all but two of them mild. The outbreak is hitting hardest in the GTA, where 233 people have tested positive.</p>
<p>The mild cases also include five Ontarians who were admitted to hospital after experiencing influenza-like symptoms. It wasn't until after they were released that lab results showed they tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Meantime, media in Cuba are reporting that a 14-month-old Toronto boy has tested positive for the virus. This is Cuba's fourth case of H1N1. The boy, who recently arrived in Cuba with his parents, was tested for the virus after experiencing a fever and respiratory symptoms. He was hospitalized and is now symptom-free, though he continues to be treated with antiviral medication, as do others who came in contact with him.</p>
<p>Symptoms of H1N1 flu are similar to seasonal influenza and can include cough, fever and sore throat.</p>

<p>What: Macbeth</p>
<p>Where: Kaleidoscope production at the Belfry Theatre</p>
<p>When: Public performances May 22, 23, 30 at 8 p.m. and 31 at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Tickets: $19.95, $22.05 (tel. 250-385-6815)</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Macbeth famously kicks off with a trio of witches conspiring while a storm howls and rages.</p>
<p>In Victoria, the evil hags are replaced by a gaggle of reporters lying in wait at a nightclub for Macbeth.</p>
<p>Welcome to a Macbeth for the 21st century. Kaleidoscope Theatre has reinvented Shakespeare's 17th-century tragedy as a scathing examination of the contemporary media's influence on politics and events.</p>
<p>Artistic director Leslie Bland has hot-rodded the play with electro-pop music, TV news-style clips, secret-service men and press conferences. Banquo's ghost is represented by a "video effect." The production's multimedia wizardry is overseen by award-winning designer Jamie Nesbitt, who created the virtuoso projections for Brilliant! The Blinding Enlightenment of Nikola Tesla at the Belfry last year.</p>
<p>"We're spinning Macbeth," Bland said. "Riffing on it, bending and warping it,"</p>
<p>Shakespeare's original dialogue is retained. However, Bland has trimmed the play -- in this case adapted for family audiences 12 and up -- to a compact 105 minutes. Meanwhile, a crew from Vancouver's JIB Entertainment has filmed the creation of Kaleidoscope's Macbeth for a documentary. The company will pitch it to national specialty networks such as Bravo!</p>
<p>Bland dreamed up the idea for his unorthodox adaptation more than 15 years ago. He wondered how a modern adaptation of Macbeth might work. In particular, he pondered the role of the witches, who foretell Macbeth's bloody rise to become king of Scotland.</p>
<p>"Who in the modern day would that be?" Bland said. "To me, it's quite obvious. It's the mainstream media."</p>
<p>In the view of Bland and others, the media's mandate to cover news events has a dark side. Sometimes reporting functions to influence -- and even create -- the news. Bland points to recent coverage of the global economic downturn, which some say helped accelerate it, or reports on the swine flu epidemic, which triggered some counter-efforts bordering on the hysterical.</p>
<p>"It's the chicken-and-egg nature of cause-and-effect in the information age," Bland said.</p>
<p>To underscore this notion, the Kaleidoscope Macbeth contains sequences in which reporters cite "opinion polls" indicating Macbeth is on a fast-track to becoming king.</p>
<p>Actor Chris Mackie said in playing the role of Macbeth, he has kept in mind the media's star-making coverage of Colin Powell and Norman Schwarzkopf during the Gulf War. (There was postwar media speculation Powell might run for president.) At the same time, Mackie is endeavouring to make Macbeth a sympathetic character so "the audience can see parts of themselves in him."</p>
<p>Action-packed Macbeth is always popular among young people, Kaleidoscope's primary audience. Pre-sales to school shows are so brisk the company has been compelled to add two extra ones. Performances for the public are offered this weekend and next.</p>
<p>The show promises to be entertaining as well as educational. Bland says a fight between Mackie as Macbeth and Trevor Hinton, playing Macduff, is worth the price of admission alone. "They do guns, knives and hand-to-hand," he noted.</p>
<p>Part of Kaleidoscope's reason for jazzing up Shakespeare is to make the Bard palatable for young people. This isn't the first time Bland has opted for an irreverent interpretation. His company's 2004 production of Twelfth Night was a groovy '60s romp with Chuck Berry duck-walks and pot-puffing hippies.</p>
<p>At the very least, the director hopes audiences will leave Macbeth in a more questioning frame of mind.</p>
<p>"We have to be self-critical," Bland said. " Our lives shouldn't always be run by what we read, or what we see on TV."</p>

<p>Health officials delivered a lesson Wednesday night to parents with children at Jack MacKenzie Elementary School about the new flu strain making waves around the world.</p>
<p>But such events likely won't be held at other Regina schools when future cases of the virus are found, said Dr. Tania Diener, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's medical health officer.</p>
<p>"We're trying to normalize it. We don't inform every school about every other infection that's in the school," Diener said after addressing parents in the school gymnasium.</p>
<p>"I think the public message is out there about how we should try and prevent the spread of this, so by telling a school that you have one case that we know of is not really going to be a benefit because they likely have more that we don't know of," said Diener.</p>
<p>The question-and-answer session attended by about 50 parents was in response to the confirmation last week of four mild cases of the new H1N1flu strain, often called swine flu, at Jack MacKenzie -- the first school in Regina to have confirmed cases. Parents with children at neighbouring St. Gabriel School were also invited to the meeting.</p>
<p>The number of cases confirmed in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region moved from six to nine on Wednesday, although the confirmed case count at Jack MacKenzie remained at four.</p>
<p>"We already have cases in other schools and we didn't go out and inform them," Diener noted, though she added the region will in certain situations, such as if there is a "cluster" of cases confirmed in one place.</p>
<p>It's expected some have recovered from the strain without ever being tested.</p>
<p>Diener said the medical community is interested in this latest flu strain because it's new, though so far it's acting much like a seasonal flu. Symptoms include fever and cough. However, health officials are staying vigilant because they don't yet know how the virus might behave when the next flu season rolls around.</p>
<p>In response to a parent's question, Diener told the group of about 50 that being ill with the new flu strain now will provide some immunity later. Even if it mutates, people who previously had it should still have some protection, she said. She encouraged parents to keep kids at home for seven days when they are sick with a respiratory illness. But people can stay in "self-isolation" at home unless they feel they are sick enough to call the family doctor, she said.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan currently has no plans to close schools.</p>
<p>Parent Craig Halvorson, who has a child attending St. Gabriel, said he appreciated the opportunity to hear about the flu straight from the region's doctors.</p>
<p>"I think it's important we get educated ourselves on the situation and I think they've done a great job here," he said.</p>
<p>Overall, there are 49 confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus in the province. The provincial Ministry of Health, which noted the "vast majority" of cases throughout Canada have been mild, said Wednesday that updated numbers will now be released weekly rather than daily.</p>

<p>The number of H1N1 cases detected in Saskatchewan has risen again.</p>
<p>Seven new cases of the virus were confirmed in the Saskatoon Health Region after the May long weekend.</p>
<p>"It's mainly hitting young people," said Dr. Johnmark Opondo, the health region's deputy medical health officer. This brings the number of confirmed cases in the Saskatoon region to 33.</p>
<p>According to Saskatchewan Health, the cases are mild except for a "borderline moderate" case in the region.</p>
<p>That person is at home and recovering and did not need hospitalization.</p>
<p>None of the confirmed Saskatchewan cases have resulted in hospitalization.</p>
<p>The ages of people with confirmed H1N1 flu cases ranges from six to about 52, Opondo said. The average age of cases is 23 and the cases are found in rural and urban areas.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region is the largest in the province, which may be the reason for the high number of cases.</p>
<p>"Maybe our physicians are particularly vigilant at testing, testing people who come in and complain of symptoms that are suggestive of influenza," Opondo said.</p>
<p>Doctors from the region are sending about 30 to 40 samples for testing per day.</p>
<p>The number of specimens the provincial lab usually receives at this time of year is much lower, as it is the end of the regular flu season.</p>
<p>The next test results will be posted by the provincial Ministry of Health on Friday.</p>
<p>"From what I understand the ministry has moved to posting surveillance data two to three times per week," Opondo said.</p>

<p>NORTH AMERICA</p>
<p>MUBARAK CANCELS TRIP TO U.S.</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has cancelled a trip to the United States due next week following the death of his young grandson, the White House said Wednesday.</p>
<p>White House spokesman Robert Gibbs told a press briefing that "tragically" Mubarak's "grandson passed away in the last 24 hours so his visit here ... has been cancelled."</p>
<p>Mubarak had been due here for talks on May 26, following a visit earlier this week by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, as U.S. President Barack Obama seeks to revive the flagging Middle East peace process.</p>
<p>The official Egyptian news agency, MENA, reported that the president's 12-year-old grandson, Mohammed Mubarak, had died on Monday "after health complications suffered during the last two days."</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>LOUIS XVI'S FINAL TESTAMENT FOUND</p>
<p>Louis XVI's final testament, written shortly before his execution, has been recovered more than two centuries after it disappeared during the French Revolution.</p>
<p>The king wrote the Declaration to all the French in 1791, and during his trial, it was cited by prosecutors as proof that he wanted to "plunge France into the horrors of civil war."</p>
<p>Louis wrote: "French people and above all Parisians.?.?. return to your king. He will always be your father, your best friend."</p>
<p>Louis was found guilty of treason and guillotined in 1793 and the manuscript disappeared shortly afterwards.</p>
<p>However, Gerard Lheritier, a French expert in ancient letters, traced it to a collector in the U.S. "The collector agreed to part with it in exchange for several million euros," said Lheritier.</p>
<p>The testament will go on public display by the end of the month at Paris' Museum of Letters and Manuscripts.</p>
<p>BRITISH PM REBUFFS ELECTION CALLS</p>
<p>LONDON - British Prime Minister Gordon Brown rebuffed Wednesday growing calls for an early general election after the historic resignation of the House of Commons' speaker in a row over MPs expenses.</p>
<p>David Cameron, leader of the main opposition Conservatives and tipped by opinion polls to be premier in roughly a year, warned that angry public demands for change would not be satisfied by Tuesday's ouster of Michael Martin.</p>
<p>Martin became the first speaker to be forced out since 1695 after 23 lawmakers signed a motion of no confidence over his resistance to reforms to the controversial lawmakers' expenses system.</p>
<p>Leaked documents showing how MPs spent public money on everything from food and drink to tennis court repairs and moat cleaning have been published by the Daily Telegraph newspaper over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>EXPLOSION HITS ATHENS BUILDING</p>
<p>ATHENS - A bomb exploded Wednesday on the third floor of a building in the chic Kolonaki district of central Athens, causing no injuries, police said.</p>
<p>The blast was preceded by an anonymous telephone call to a Greek newspaper, a police official said.</p>
<p>Streets in the neighbourhood, near the capital's main Syntagma Square where parliament is located, were sealed off as a fire truck was seen arriving at the scene.</p>
<p>Such explosions are frequent in Athens and the northern city of Thessaloniki, and often linked to extreme left or anarchist groups. Targets include public buildings, diplomatic missions, banks and car dealers.</p>
<p>U.S., RUSSIA END HIGH-STAKES TALKS</p>
<p>MOSCOW - The United States and Russia on Wednesday concluded the first round of talks aimed at replacing a landmark Cold War-era nuclear disarmament treaty before it expires in December.</p>
<p>Negotiators met behind closed doors to discuss a successor to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, in high-stakes talks whose outcome could have far-reaching implications for global security.</p>
<p>The initial two-day negotiating session went in "business-like and constructive atmosphere," the Russian foreign ministry spokesman said, adding that the next round would take place in Geneva on June 1-3.</p>
<p>ANTI-CORRUPTION COURT RULED ILLEGAL</p>
<p>BRATISLAVA - Slovakia's constitutional court on Wednesday ruled that the country's special anti-corruption court, which handles white collar and organized crime cases, was "anti-constitutional."</p>
<p>The ruling looks set to halt the work of the court, which has sent a string of criminals to jail since being set up in 2005.</p>
<p>But the judgment also said that convictions the court had already passed would not be affected.</p>
<p>Wednesday's ruling came in response to a complaint made by 46 deputies with Prime Minister Robert Fico's Social Democrat coalition, who complained about the high salaries of the court's judges.</p>
<p>They earned nearly 10 times more than the average income in Slovakia.</p>
<p>The country's anti-corruption court, which was set up by the then prime minister, Christian Democrat Mikulas Dzurinda, has jailed two mafia chiefs for life for murder and blackmail.</p>
<p>It has also sent several leaders of local councils and executives from the world of football to jail.</p>
<p>The problem has reached high into government, with four ministers in the current coalition having to resign on suspicion of corruption.</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
<p>VENEZUELA SEIZES OIL SERVICE FIRMS</p>
<p>CARACAS - Venezuela announced Wednesday it expropriated another 35 oil service firms, in addition to the 39 taken over since the government extended state control over all activities related to the key industry.</p>
<p>The Energy Ministry detailed the takeovers -- mostly in the northwestern Lake Maracaibo area -- in the government's official gazette. The companies include staff and material transport firms, as well as dock maintenance companies.</p>
<p>The Simco consortium -- backed by capital of the U.S. Wood Group -- was the only foreign-capital backed firm targeted on the list announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>On May 7, Venezuela's National Assembly passed a law which "reserves for the state, the goods and services connected to primary hydrocarbon activities."</p>
<p>Shortly after the law's passage the government announced that private contractors servicing wells, transporting workers and providing other services in the oil-rich Maracaibo Lake area would be nationalized.</p>
<p>Venezuela has proven oil reserves of around 99 billion barrels and is the western hemisphere's largest oil exporter.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>IRAN HAILS MISSILE TEST AS SUCCESS</p>
<p>SEMNAN - President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad announced on Wednesday that Iran had successfully test-fired a new medium-range missile, drawing a warning from Israel that Europe too should now worry about the Islamic republic's ballistic program.</p>
<p>U.S. Defence Secretary Robert Gates said the test appeared to have been successful.</p>
<p>After Ahmadinejad made the announcement in the northern city of Semnan, close to the launch site, Italy announced the last-minute cancellation of a visit by Foreign Minister Franco Frattini when it emerged the Iranian president expected to receive him there.</p>
<p>When asked in Washington about the launch, Gates told a congressional hearing: "The information that I have read indicates that it was a successful flight test.</p>
<p>"The missile will have a range of approximately 2,000 to 2,500 kilometres.</p>
<p>"Because of some of the problems they've had with their engines, we think at least at this stage of the testing, it's probably closer to the lower end of that range."</p>
<p>Gates added it was unclear if the missile had hit its intended target.</p>
<p>Italy's Frattini had been due in Iran later on Wednesday, but his office announced that he would no longer go after the venue for his Ahmadinejad talks was switched to near the missile test site.</p>
<p>Israel said the new test should be of concern to European countries since it meant Iran now had a missile that put them in range too.</p>
<p>"In terms of strategic importance, this new missile test doesn't change anything for us since the Iranians already tested a missile with a range of 1,500 kilometres (nearly 950 miles)," Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon said.</p>
<p>"But it should worry the Europeans," he said. "The Iranians are also trying to develop a ballistic missile with a range of 10,000 kilometres (6,250 miles) that could reach the coast of the United States."</p>
<p>BAGHDAD BLAST KILLS AT LEAST 34</p>
<p>BAGHDAD - A powerful car bomb tore through a Baghdad street full of diners on Wednesday, killing at least 34 people and wounding 72 in the biggest blast to rock the capital in weeks, security officials said.</p>
<p>The explosion occurred in the mainly Shiite Shula quarter in the city's northwest, next to the Al-Sadrain interchange that is popular for its eateries, officials from the interior and defence ministries told AFP.</p>
<p>"At least 34 people were killed and 72 wounded. The explosion happened around a number of restaurants and retail shops. The car bomb was parked," one official at the defence ministry told AFP.</p>
<p>"The streets were filled with people and there were a large number of people shopping. Many people were sitting in the restaurants. That is why there are so many victims."</p>
<p>Medics from Baghdad's Noor, Yarmuk and Medic hospitals confirmed the toll.</p>
<p>The blast in the poor Shiite neighbourhood was the biggest explosion since April 29 when more than 50 people -- again in mostly Shiite districts of the capital -- were killed in a wave of near-simultaneous bombings.</p>
<p>CHINESE-CANADIAN SWINE FLU POSITIVE</p>
<p>BEIJING - A Chinese-Canadian is the fifth person in mainland China, and the second in Beijing, to test positive for swine flu, the Xinhua news agency reported Wednesday, citing the municipal health bureau.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old, who Xinhua said was not a Chinese national, was studying at a college in Toronto prior to arriving in Beijing on May 16.</p>
<p>There have been no reported swine flu fatalities so far either in mainland Chine or among the three confirmed cases recorded in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>More than 20 foreign tourists held in Tibet over fears that an Italian woman among them had swine flu were released Wednesday after tests revealed she was suffering from common influenza, Chinese officials said.</p>
<p>Worldwide, the number of swine flu infections surged past 10,000 on Wednesday, with 80 dead, the World Health Organization said.</p>

DELICACY: Workers collect adult snails at the Corujeira
snail-breeding farm, 50 kilometres north of Lisbon, on Wednesday.
The proverbial snail's pace can be deceptive, especially if you have
millions of snails to handle and a business to run. Portugal lags
behind France --- the world's biggest consumer of snails where some
30,000 tonnes of the gastropods are devoured annually as an
exquisite delicacy --- by market size, but not by per-capita
consumption, which is about the same.

<p>As a lifelong marketer and an avid follower of WestJet and other Canadian companies' marketing and communications, I must say I could not disagree more with Kevin Baker, both in his tone and message.</p>
<p>A declaration is meaningless and, in fact, harmful, if a company isn't sincere, reliable and equipped with the competencies to deliver. WestJet has made this declaration so that everyone (the public, employees, investors, etc.) is fully aware of what the company feels is reasonable and standard practice. From my knowledge of WestJet and its reputation, living up to its promises is what makes the Care-antee real, as opposed to rhetorical. If WestJet and WestJetters don't live up to their declaration and, more importantly, live up to what is fair and respectful to their customers, their business will suffer.</p>
<p>The bottom line is this: If a company doesn't live up to its promises, its credibility is zero and people will buy elsewhere and recommend its competitors. In this challenging time, companies like WestJet are to be applauded for candidly and genuinely coming out with value, product and basic human treatment promises.</p>
<p>The Care-antee is a genuine offer. Yes, the fine print almost always exists in this day and age as a matter of legal protection. But, in the end, doesn't WestJet's past performance lead most customers to expect them to be "reasonable" in living up to this declaration? Maybe the better questions are whether customers feel they received value, whether they think the company is fair and whether they feel the experience connected with them as persons? WestJet, through its history as well as its recent handling of guests at Christmas and through the H1N1 flu outbreak in Mexico, has earned the right to declare what it stands for, and the right to be seen as credible. Just ask WestJet's passengers.</p>
<p>Over and over again, throughout its history, WestJet has consistently demonstrated this Careantee through its actions. Now, it has a name. I like the Care-antee platform and believe it has lots of further potential for WestJet. I predict WestJet will continue to be successful by creating expectations and then, more importantly, following through on promises to treat people fairly, with dignity and with respect.</p>
<p>WestJet has created success through its employees' energy, compassion and appreciation, and Mr. Baker's article does these efforts a disservice. WestJet deserves its reputation, and the Care-antee deserves to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>It is taking longer than expected to prepare the seed stock needed to manufacture a vaccine for the H1N1 influenza virus, the World Health Organization said yesterday. At a meeting to discuss the outbreak of the so-called swine flu, the global health agency said the virus isn't growing very quickly in the laboratory. That means vaccine makers won't be able to start production until mid-July at the earliest. Once the companies have seed stock in hand, it takes about four to six months to produce the vaccine. In a best-case scenario, the WHO said, vaccine makers could produce 4.9 billion pandemic flu shots per year. The agency says there now are 9,830 infections in 40 countries, including 79 deaths.</p>

<p>F or only the second time in the history of the Calgary Vipers, Evan Greusel won't be standing on the mound to throw out the season-opening pitch.</p>
<p>In 2006, he was briefly traded from the team and couldn't, but this year Greusel, who is also the team's pitching coach, is handing the honour off to Joe Sergent.</p>
<p>"I was shocked when he told me that. He said I'm going to give you the ball," says Sergent, 30.</p>
<p>"He said it's my turn. I think it's an honour. As long as I've been a professional I've never pitched the opening day. It's a big deal for me personally."</p>
<p>Adding to the opening day pressure, Sergent will be playing against a personal idol of his in Jose Lima, who's been pegged to start for the Long Beach Armada for Thursday's matchup at Foothills Stadium starting at 7:05 p. m.</p>
<p>The former major league pitcher had a career peak in 1999 when won 21 games with the Houston Astros and earned a trip to the all star game.</p>
<p>"That's going to be fun in itself," says Sergent. "I was in college down in Texas (Lamar University) when he was playing for Houston. I was watching him throw every fifth day and now I'm going to watch him right here throw against me."</p>
<p>Originally from California, Sergent spent much of the 2008 season dividing his time between the Vipers and his part time teaching job in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>He's chosen to commit to the Vipers full time this season rather than travel between games.</p>
<p>"Towards late July, early August, I was starting to get tired of the flying back and forth so it taxed on me a little bit," says Sergent. "I finally came up here full-time in the middle of August, got back into a routine and was able to finish strong.</p>
<p>"I'm one of those guys who if I make one bad pitch I always look back on it the next day or that Northern League history to bat .400 with the Snakes in 2007 and was named Baseball America's independent leagues player of the year.</p>
<p>Calgary won the first two games, 17-13 and 19-10, on a smaller-than-regulation field and tied Edmonton 6-6 at Foothills.</p>
<p>The results don't count for anything and Vipers manager Morgan Burkhart only saw the games as indications of how his players shaping up and starting to jell.</p>
<p>"I take absolutely nothing from those exhibition games other than the attitude put forth by the team and it was terrific," says Burkhart. "There's a difference between an exhibition game and when it's turned on for real."</p>
<p>Burkhart is finalizing his 22-man roster, which should be finished later today. Pitcher Jordy Alexander was released over the weekend and a couple more players will have to be let go but Burkhart wasn't giving any hints on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Sergent predicts a fearsome squad will emerge this year and vie for the league title.</p>
<p>"I think we're better than last year," he says. "Our core nucleus is back. We added some power. We added speed, which we needed.</p>
<p>"We got better pitching-wise --we have a great bullpen. I joke with our pitching coach Evan Greusel that everybody throws harder than me. These guys can throw this year."</p>
<p>night and think what could I have done to not have that happen and I always attribute it to conditioning, working out, getting sleep."</p>
<p>After coming second place last season in the Golden Baseball League final game against the Orange County Flyers, Sergent says this year's team is looking stronger.</p>
<p>"For the guys that were there last year, for the last eight months we've been sitting and waiting to get this thing rolling. We can't wait for Thursday. It can't come fast enough," says Sergent, who was 3-0 in the 2008 playoffs.</p>
<p>"I've pretty much been the bridesmaid my whole career, never been the bride."</p>
<p>Over the long weekend, the Vipers played three exhibition games against the Edmonton Capitals--two in Fort McMurray and one Monday at Foothills Stadium. The fourth game in Edmonton scheduled for Tuesday was cancelled due to snow.</p>
<p>The Capitals include 40-yearold former Viper Darryl Brinkley who became the first player in</p>

<p>Golden Baseball League Preview</p>
<p>Calgary Vipers - Founded: 2004 - Stadium: Foothills Stadium - Capacity: 6,000</p>
<p>The vipers finished second in the league after losing the 2008 Golden Baseball League championship to the Orange County Flyers in the final game of the best-of-five series. Calgary won the first half of the north division season but finished second with a 19-24 regular season record.</p>
<p>They've brought back regulars such as Carlos Duncan, Nelson Castro and Jorge Mejia and have re-signed key pitchers including Joe Sergent, Makoto Suzuki and Evan Greusel, who is also the pitching coach. Calgary has added hitting with Fehlandt Lentini and Terry Mermer.</p>
<p>Edmonton Capitals - Founded: 2004 - Stadium: Telus Field - Capacity: 10,000</p>
<p>Known as the cracker-cats last season before the Edmonton Oilers bought them and changed the name. Edmonton finished at the top of the north division in the regular season (29-15) and featured a number of big hitters in 2008 with a team batting average of .322. The Capitals have scooped up former Viper Darryl Brinkley from the Tijuana Potros, which were forced to disband due to the unavailability of stadiums in Mexico because of the H1N1 virus. As a Viper in 2007, he became the first player in northern league history to bat .400 and was named baseball America's independent leagues player of the year.</p>
<p>Victoria Seals - Founded: 2009 - Stadium: Royal Athletic Park - Capacity: 4,247</p>
<p>New team for the 2009 season owned by former Calgary Cannons owner Russ Parker. Manager Darrell Evans was on the coaching staff with orange county Flyers helping lead them to the Golden Baseball League championship last year over the Calgary Vipers. Evans hit 414 home runs in the major leagues during a 21-year career. He has assembled a lineup that includes 24-year-old former San Diego Padres pitching prospect Isaac Hess and pitcher Josh Karp, who was chosen sixth overall in the 2001 major-league draft and is making a comeback after injury.</p>
<p>Chico Outlaws - Founded: 2005 (Chico, Calif.) - Stadium: Nettleton Stadium - Capacity: 4,200</p>
<p>The Outlaws from California finished the 2008 season third in the North Division with a 19-25 record and failed to make the playoffs after winning the 2007 league championship. They have the distinction of having the biggest home crowd support, topping the Golden Baseball League with an average crowd of 2,175 at home games. Chico has brought in a new manager, Greg Cadaret, who was a major-league relief pitcher who appeared in the 1988 World Series with the Oakland Athletics.</p>
<p>Long Beach Armada - Founded: 2005 (Long Beach, Calif.) - Stadium: Blair Field - Capacity: 3,238</p>
<p>The Long Beach Armada has a track record of attracting former major league players and sending them back. The organization has returned 17 players to the big leagues including five last year. This season's roster includes former all-star pitcher Jose Lima, who won 21 games with the Houston Astros in 1999, and pitcher Hideki Irabu, a two-time New York Yankees World Series champion. Lima is slotted to start against Calgary in the Vipers' home opener at Foothills Stadium Thursday night.</p>
<p>Orange County Flyers - Founded: 2005 (Fullerton, Calif.) - Stadium: Goodwin Field - Capacity: 3,500</p>
<p>Under the guidance of hall of fame montreal expos catcher Gary Carter, the Flyers beat the Calgary Vipers in the best-of-five Golden Baseball League Championship final last Season. However, Carter has moved on to manage the Long Island Ducks in the Atlantic League. He has been replaced by former major-leaguer and Cal State Fullerton Alum Phil Nevin. Former Flyers from last season, Terry Mermer and Mark Okano, have been traded to the Calgary Vipers.</p>
<p>Tucson Toros - Founded: 2009 (Tucson, Ariz.) - Stadium: Hi Corbett Field - Capacity: 9,500</p>
<p>The Tucson Toros are joining the Golden Baseball League this season after a long, storied association with the Houston Astros in the 1980s and '90s playing in the Pacific Coast League. They became the Tucson Sidewinders, but that team has since moved to Reno in the PCL and the Toros are back playing at Hi Corbett field as of 2009. The team is under the guidance of field manager Tim Johnson.</p>
<p>St. George Road Runners - Founded: 2007 (St. George, Utah) - Stadium: Bruce Hurst Field - Capacity: 2,500</p>
<p>The road runners finished the regular season in second place with a 25-19 record helped by a .418 batting average from former Boston Red Sox prospect Claudio Arias. The Road Runners are managed by Cory Snyder a former major league shortstop who played for the Cleveland Indians, Chicago White Sox, Toronto Blue Jays, San Francisco Giants, and Los Angeles Dodgers. He hit 33 home runs and had 82 RBI in 1987 with the Indians and was only the sixth man to hit three home runs in a game in both leagues.</p>
<p>Yuma Scorpions - Founded: 2005 (Yuma, Ariz.) - Stadium: Desert Sun Stadium - Capacity: 10,500</p>
<p>Yuma finished at the bottom of the south division in 2008 with a 23-21 record. This year the Scorpions hope for better, bolstered by new Japanese pitcher Yosuke Kawaguchi. The 21-year-old hurler recorded a 1.69 era with the Japanese minor-league affiliate of the Yomiuri Giants in 2008. Yuma is managed by Mike Marshall, who helped the Los Angeles Dodgers win the 1988 World Series when he hit a home run in Game 2.</p>

<p>The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario could see its budget jeopardized if it doesn't get its staff to wash their hands more when dealing with patients, says the head of Eastern Ontario's health-planning agency.</p>
<p>In recent months, CHEO has battled repeated outbreaks of infectious diarrhea, including one case in the last month thought to have contributed to the death of a young patient, and faced criticism for having one of the worst rates of hand hygiene among Ontario's hospitals.</p>
<p>While the Champlain Local Health Integration Network has no immediate plans to intervene, it does have the power to compel CHEO to sign a written pledge outlining how it would use provincial money to improve infection control, said Dr. Robert Cushman, chief executive of the agency. The Champlain LHIN distributes the provincial money that forms the bulk of hospital budgets.</p>
<p>"We have the ability to introduce these performance measures, and this is something we can look at," Cushman said.</p>
<p>Since 2008, Ontario hospitals have operated under new rules that require them to sign two-year "accountability agreements" with regional health-planning agencies before they receive their yearly provincial grants.</p>
<p>The current agreements include strict rules about how hospitals spend and forbid them from running deficits.</p>
<p>But when new agreements come into effect in 2011, they could be expanded to track how well hospitals take care of patients, including how often doctors and nurses clean their hands, Cushman said.</p>
<p>Under such an agreement, if CHEO did not improve its hand-hygiene rates, it could be ordered to beef up its infection-control practices.</p>
<p>The hospital could even be forced to conduct a full-scale review of its infection-control practices or risk losing some of its provincial funding.</p>
<p>Cushman said he's confident CHEO is working to improve its record and sees no immediate need to intervene.</p>
<p>"They need to get moving on this and get their numbers up so they're impressive and they're reliable," he said.</p>
<p>The emergence of infectious diseases such as the Mexican swine flu and SARS has made infection control at hospitals a priority, said Cushman. "Given what's happened with this new strain of the H1N1 flu, it's brought infection control to the fore."</p>
<p>But Michel Bilodeau, CHEO's chief executive, said the government-imposed efforts to monitor and report hospital-acquired infections come at a price. In particular, having the staff and technology to gather the data cuts into already tight hospital budgets, given that the extra costs are not funded by the province.</p>
<p>"It will obviously increase the proportion of our budget that's spent on administrative activities rather than patient care, since we get absolutely no funding from the province for doing that," Bilodeau said.</p>
<p>Officials believe the low rates of hand-cleaning among CHEO's doctors and nurses could be linked to a series of infectious diarrhea outbreaks that has plagued the hospital in recent months.</p>
<p>According to the first provincial statistics on how often hospital staff clean their hands, CHEO staff complied a mere 35.3 per cent of the time -- the second-worst result among the province's teaching hospitals and well below the provincial average of 62.2 per cent.</p>
<p>Ontario's other pediatric hospital, Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, had a 55-per-cent compliance rate.</p>
<p>"The fact that CHEO is behind in this data is obviously concerning, but it's more concerning given that they've had outbreaks this winter," said Cushman.</p>
<p>Since January, CHEO has battled four outbreaks of gastro-intestinal viruses -- one bout of norovirus and three of rotavirus -- in the hospital's 31-bed infant and toddler patient unit.</p>
<p>According to Ottawa Public Health, the four outbreaks at CHEO include:</p>
<p>- Five cases of norovirus from Jan. 7 to 11;</p>
<p>- nine cases of rotavirus from Jan. 19 to Feb. 10;</p>
<p>- three cases of rotavirus from March 3 to 10;</p>
<p>- and seven cases of rotavirus from April 27 to May 6.</p>
<p>During the most recent outbreak, the spread of the rotavirus is believed to have contributed to the death of a baby who had other underlying conditions.</p>
<p>The hospital has since worked with Ottawa public-health officials to identify gaps in its infection-control practices and pledged to roll out a campaign to educate staff and patients' families on hand hygiene.</p>
<p>CHEO has also promised to issue quarterly updates on how often its doctors and nurses clean their hands. The plan goes beyond the once-a-year public reporting required of Ontario hospitals.</p>
<p>Officials hope that by keeping closer tabs on the hospital's hand-cleaning practices, staff will do more to prevent the spread of infections.</p>
<p>"Where we have bad results, we need to correct them, and we're taking action to correct them," said Bilodeau.</p>

<p>A summit between flu vaccine makers and the heads of the UN and the World Health Organization produced no new concrete offers of donated vaccine, the WHO said yesterday.</p>
<p>While manufacturers acknowledged a global responsibility, at least one wanted to know who would pay for vaccine to be set aside for developing countries, a WHO spokesperson said.</p>
<p>To date only one of the major manufacturers, British-based <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, has promised to make a contribution of H1N1 vaccine to the WHO for distribution to countries that cannot afford vaccine.</p>
<p>WHO spokesperson Melinda Henry played down the lack of progress, saying talks are ongoing.</p>
<p>"I don't think that firm pledges were really expected today,'' said Henry, who is with the agency's immunization, vaccines and biologics division.</p>
<p>"I think we could say that WHO is hopeful and we're working with these companies and we're going to be talking with them on a bilateral basis in the coming days and weeks.''</p>
<p>The meeting brought executives of more than 30 vaccine-making companies to Geneva to meet with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon and WHO Director General Margaret Chan.</p>
<p>GSK announced nearly two years ago that it would donate 50 million doses of H5N1 avian flu vaccine to a stockpile the WHO was amassing for developing countries. That promise was made when H5N1 appeared to be the most likely cause of the next pandemic.</p>
<p>Last Friday the company said it would convert that promised contribution into 50 million doses of H1N1 vaccine, which it has plans to begin making shortly.</p>

</p>
<p>In the midst of a possible H1N1 flu pandemic, I am shocked by the laissez-faire comments from executives at our local hospitals.</p>
<p>To say they are satisfied, or pleased with the results of a handwashing audit that shows 30 per cent non-compliance is disgusting. Why are they not quoted as saying: "We are ashamed of this record?"</p>
<p>We are not talking about being able and competent to perform a technical, medical test or procedure. We're talking about being able, and willing, to take time to wash your hands for the safety of your patients.</p>
<p>Even grade school children know how to wash their hands.</p>
<p>We should not be satisfied with anything less than 100 per cent compliance. How many newborn babies are nurses allowed to drop in the course of their duties -- is 30 per cent OK? I think not.</p>
<p>The only solution to this issue, since we can't seem to figure out how to hold unionized staff in publicly funded institutions accountable for performance expectations, is the education of the public as to their rights.</p>
<p>We need to all take responsibility for our own health, and not trust the leaders of our hospitals to do it for us. This means stopping all medical staff before they touch you and saying, "May I see you wash or sanitize your hands please?"</p>
<p>In this way, you can be confident that whatever they were doing before you arrived, you will not be at undue risk.</p>
<p>How scary is it that we're getting more data about why you should avoid a hospital when you need one the most.</p>

<p>Japan dispatched masked health inspectors with fever-sensing guns to walk among passengers to stop the H1N1 flu before it could sneak off airplanes arriving from North America.</p>
<p>But the flu has taken hold on this island nation anyway, with fast-increasing numbers of confirmed cases in western Japan. It is now inevitable, experts said, that the infection will spread to Tokyo, where about 35 million people live in the world's largest metropolis and where commuters pack cheek to jowl on a vast network of commuter trains.</p>
<p>Besides the United States, Mexico and Canada, Japan now has more confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus than any other country, according to the World Health Organization. The government here reported 178 cases yesterday.</p>

<p>Two reactions have become evident since the sudden appearance of this new wave of an H1N1 flu pandemic: surprise andconfusion. Surprise, because it was unexpected. Confusion, because we have been bombarded with information that seems to be clear at times and less so at others, especially when it comes to evolution of the virus, the number of potential infections versus number of confirmed cases, or even that certain individuals react more severely to the infection than others.</p>
<p>I think we are extremely reassured by the way that international, national and provincial health agencies have responded to keep us informed on changes in the situation, and to take appropriate steps to limit undesirable impact on the population as much as possible.</p>
<p>Canadians have good reasons to have confidence in the proficiency of our experts. We have learned from the 2003 SARS epidemic, and Mexico has asked the Public Health Agency of Canada National Microbiology Laboratory to confirm the influenza infection in this country.</p>
<p>I also believe we have another reason to be reassured. Rx&D's Health Research Foundation (HRF), a private foundation established 45 years ago by Canada's research-based pharmaceutical companies, determined in 2005 that a priority for health research should be precisely to invest in preparation for pandemics. In 2007, following an independent competition, this initiative resulted in the awarding of a $1.6-million grant from the foundation, the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency to Mark Loeb of McMaster University for his research on the transmission of pandemic infections.</p>
<p>More specifically, Loeb, a world-renowned expert in the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and his team work with Hutterite communities in Western Canada. The researchers use computer systems to analyze person-to-person and pig-human transmission of the influenza virus.</p>
<p>We therefore hope that interpretation of Loeb's research findings will not only enhance our understanding of this type of transmission but also, and more importantly, permit us to develop increasingly effective measures to respond to pandemics, especially related to H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Research is the cornerstone of any new discovery. It plays a crucial role when the health of Canadians and the world is at stake, as is the case today. It also allows us to acquire efficient public health practices and policies.</p>

<p>Dear Susan,</p>
<p>I work in insurance and my company moved eight months ago to newly renovated offices, which are very nice. But combined with recent layoffs, the move has made me feel more isolated and paranoid about my work than I was before. In our other building, I used to see colleagues in the reception area, halls or stairwell, and we'd catch up as we passed each other. Now we're in an office tower and spread out on different floors, so we don't see each other unless there's a meeting. Most of us even use different elevators, conference rooms and bathrooms. What can I do to feel less out of the loop?</p>
<p>– Lonely Planet</p>
<p>Dear Lonely,</p>
<p>You'll have to overcome management's design blunders by changing your habits. Take the long way around, use different elevator banks, bathrooms and coffee machines, and seek out colleagues where they sit to get around the fact that the transition team didn't create areas where people naturally converge.</p>
<p>This meandering will not only boost your morale but your efficiency. All recent evidence points to spontaneous meetings as the germs of creativity – a formula that any good sales team knows well. When salespeople fly thousands of miles to meet and greet clients, they know that a handshake transmits much more than swine flu. It's all about building trust through brief, even chance encounters.</p>
<p>Barry Wellman, a sociologist at University of Toronto and the director of NetLab, a research group devoted to computer networks, is one of the world's experts on connecting through technology. In the early nineties, he and his colleagues used webcams and other forms of electronic media to exchange ideas and keep tabs on each other.</p>
<p>But these days he prefers rubber soles to fibre optics, he told me when I met him over breakfast last month. When he wants to chat with U of T colleagues, Prof. Wellman walks down the halls, wryly calling this type of communication “sneaker net.”</p>
<p>His immediate impression of your employer? “I think they're in trouble. You want to have places people go to casually. And this is the tip of the iceberg for remote workers, because informal interaction drives a firm's tacit knowledge.”</p>
<p>In fact, the free-wheeling give-and-take of our conversation, and our subsequent e-mail contact, reflect one of his research findings: Face-to-face communication is the catalyst for most electronic communication.</p>
<p>In 2004, Prof. Wellman and Anabel Quan-Haase, now a sociology professor at University of Western Ontario, published a study that showed how people who work right near each other communicate more often with each other than they do with people whose offices are on different floors.</p>
<p>That shouldn't be surprising, but here's the kicker: They communicate more using the electronic gadgets that are supposed to cancel out the effects of physical distance.</p>
<p>Being close by meant that they called, e-mailed and texted each other more often than they did with more far-flung colleagues – whether these colleagues were one floor up or in Hong Kong. It turns out that proximity matters.</p>
<p>Keeping “sneaker net” in mind, one guideline to decreasing your isolation is to alter your patterns of movement within the building. Make that more likely to happen by changing your destination. Walking toward a coffee machine located at the end of a long corridor prompts people who don't usually work together to bump into each other on their way to a cup of joe and then congregate in front of the machine, creating what University of Waterloo research psychologist Colin Ellard calls a “thirdspace” – a water-cooler-like area where information is exchanged.</p>
<p>In his engaging new book, You Are Here: Why We Can Find Our Way to the Moon But Get Lost in the Mall, Prof. Ellard shows how basic features of our environment – from where we place our desks and coffee makers to the vantage point from a favourite armchair – reflect our mental architecture: the maps in our heads that allow us to move toward what is important to us, while keeping tabs on possible threats.</p>
<p>Prof. Ellard also cited research showing that people whose offices are separated by more than 30 metres almost never meet spontaneously. But bumping into someone by accident, “that's where creativity is sparked,” he told me.</p>
<p>Of course, it all depends on what you're after. In professional offices, fostering collegiality lines up nicely with other corporate goals, but that's not always true in other kinds of workplaces.</p>
<p>When I took a visitor to the Montreal Casino, I discovered a warren of slot machines and gaming tables so tightly packed that it was all but impossible not to cross paths with other players.</p>
<p>No one really wants to bump into their supervisor or bank manager in that environment, but bump we did, into my son's third-grade teacher. When I encountered her by the blackjack tables, she deftly averted her eyes.</p>
<p>The space was expertly designed to part people with their cash, but the architect forgot to consider another human factor: the desire to be in your own bubble when an activity is taboo. In my view, we'd have been better off in your new office space, designed as it is for lone actors in isolated lairs.</p>
<p>It is incumbent on you to get around this secret society with the help of “sneaker net.” Don't wait for next spring: do it now.</p>

<p>Iran</p>
<p>Analysts play down Tehran's threat to region</p>
<p>A pair of reports released yesterday by prominent think tanks play down the potential dangers presented by Iran, concluding it is at least six years away from building a deliverable nuclear weapon and that its ability to wreak havoc in the Middle East through surrogates is exaggerated.</p>
<p>A report by a group of Russian and American scientists and engineers at the EastWest Institute concludes that though Iran could build a nuclear device within three years of deciding to do so, it will not be able to deliver those weapons very far for years. A separate Rand Corp. report notes "significant barriers and buffers" to Iran's ambitions because of the reality of regional ethnic and religious politics and "its limited conventional military capacity, diplomatic isolation and past strategic missteps."</p>

<p>Israeli planes retaliate after town shelled</p>
<p>Israeli warplanes bombed a Hamas security outpost and tunnels by the border with Egypt yesterday, after a rocket fired from the coastal territory damaged a home in the Israeli town of Sderot, Israeli and Hamas sources said.</p>
<p>No one was hurt in the Sderot strike - the first in several weeks - while a Palestinian woman suffered moderate wounds in the Israeli air raids, authorities said.</p>

<p>A rejuvenated Hubble Space Telescope, more powerful than ever, departed the U.S. space shuttle Atlantis yesterday and sailed off for new discoveries.</p>
<p>Hubble - considered to be at its prime following five days of repairs and upgrades - was gently dropped overboard by the shuttle astronauts, the last humans to see the 19-year-old observatory up close. The Hubble team hopes to resume celestial observations by the end of summer.</p>

<p>Russia</p>
<p>Kremlin hopes to change ex-allies' view of history</p>
<p>Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has created a commission to try to counter what the Kremlin sees as an anti-Russian view of 20th century history.</p>
<p>Kremlin leaders have clashed with former Soviet vassals such as Ukraine and the Baltic states for confronting the Kremlin's interpretation of the 20th century when large swathes of Europe were occupied by Soviet troops for decades. Russia says its former allies have forgotten the sacrifices made by the Soviet Union during World War II, which cost about 27 million Soviet lives.</p>

<p>Mexico has confirmed 74 deaths from swine flu amid 3,734 cases, the Health Ministry said.</p>
<p>Most of the confirmed cases are from Mexico City and the states of San Luis Potosi, Hidalgo and Mexico, the ministry said Tuesday in an e-mailed statement.</p>

<p>Contracting swine flu from a woman coughing on the subway is now a greater threat than getting the virus from a Mexican vacationer, health officials suggested yesterday.</p>
<p>The majority of new swine flu cases in Toronto are now from human-to-human contact within the city and not from people who have picked up the virus in other countries, Toronto Public Health's director of communicable disease control told the Toronto Board of Health yesterday.</p>
<p>A day after Canada lifted travel restrictions to Mexico, there were 113 confirmed cases of swine flu in Toronto, and the virus is still spreading, Dr. Barbara Yaffe said told the board.</p>
<p>"The evidence shows this virus is circulating in the community," she said. "Nearly 90% of new cases are locally acquired."</p>

</p>
<p>Limitations for Canadians travelling to and from Mexico were lifted yesterday as the swine flu appears to be "levelling off" in the country where it was first discovered earlier this spring.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters in a conference call yesterday afternoon that with the current knowledge of the swine flu, or H1N1 virus, it does not make sense to maintain a non-essential travel restriction to Mexico.</p>
<p>"The virus, as it spreads in Canada, the United States and internationally, is more along the lines of the severity we see with the seasonal flu," Butler-Jones said. "In addition, the outbreak in Mexico seems to be levelling off, so as we get more understanding of this virus, it does not make sense to have a travel warning to a country where the virus is spreading similar to in Canada.</p>
<p>"We no longer feel it is necessary to say 'wait until we know more,' because initially the issue was that in Mexico, we were seeing an initial presentation of a very severe disease in a fair number of people," Butler-Jones said, noting the end to restrictions was effective immediately.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said strict surveillance of the disease will continue.</p>
<p>He said people should remain diligent in protecting themselves, especially if they are more vulnerable to illness.</p>
<p>"Travelling into any country where influenza is spreading is something for people to be conscious of," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"For people with underlying chronic disease or other conditions that put them at greater risk of severity of illness if (they get the flu), that's something they should still be conscious of in terms of travel during influenza season, or when influenza is spreading, anyway."</p>
<p>In the conference call - which also included Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who is in Geneva for a meeting of the world's health officials - Butler-Jones said previous pandemics have slowed down as weather changes in the summer months, and said it appears this case is no different, but he would not rule out another spike in infection rates. An increase of cases is also possible in the Southern Hemisphere, he said.</p>
<p>"This is a new virus, and we don't really know how it will (react), but if it's like other influenza viruses, it will slow down," he said.</p>
<p>There are 520 confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada, according to individual reports from the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>Updated figures are expected tomorrow.</p>
<p>Globally, the World Health Organization reports more than 8,800 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, resulting in 74 deaths.</p>
<p>The United States, with more than 5,000 cases, represents the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by Mexico, which has more than 3,100 cases and represents the majority of the fatal cases, with 68.</p>
<p>Greece recorded its first confirmed case of swine flu yesterday, a 19-year-old man who recently returned from the United States, junior health minister Georges Papagiorgos told reporters.</p>
<p>Although he was allowed home after initial treatment, he had since been hospitalized, Greek media reports said.</p>
<p>Also yesterday, the World Health Organization cautioned against declaring a full-fledged swine flu pandemic yet, even as cases in Japan and the United States soared and a New York school official died of the virus.</p>
<p>The U.S. government reported yesterday more than 400 new cases, to take the nation's total number of infections above 5,000.</p>
<p>In Japan, of the 125 cases confirmed by WHO, 118 of those infections were confirmed since Sunday.</p>

</p>
<p>Local tourism operators and gardeners are crossing their fingers that Saturday and Sunday's glorious sunshine --not Monday's rain and snow -- is the harbinger of a great season to come.</p>
<p>The May long weekend is the traditional kickoff to the summer travel and the gardening season in Alberta, and good weather plays a big role in the success of both.</p>
<p>The weather on Saturday and Sunday proved perfect for the official opening of Heritage Park's summer season, which runs May 16 to Sept.</p>
<p>The turnout on both days was "fabulous," said Janelle Morris, a communications specialist for Heritage Park.</p>
<p>Monday's gloomy skies were a downer, but there were still lots of umbrella-toting people lined up at the gate to get into the historical village when it opened at 9:30 a. m.</p>
<p>"Diehard Calgarians come out even in chilly weather," Morris said.</p>
<p>About 120 guests at two sittings stayed warm and dry by enjoying a sold-out Victoria Day afternoon tea, complete with scones, jam and dainty finger sandwiches, in the Wainwright Hotel.</p>
<p>Likewise, about 75 people ignored the drizzle on Monday to help Fort Calgary celebrate the 136th anniversary of the formation of the North West Mounted Police -- the precursor of the RCMP -- with a ceremonial cake-cutting, games and an indoor treasure hunt.</p>
<p>"It's good to be indoors," said Strathmore resident Jason Philp of the event that he and his family, including their guests from Manitoba and New Zealand, attended on the holiday afternoon.</p>
<p>"Spring is due, long overdue," Philp added as he cradled two-week-old daughter Hannah in his arms.</p>
<p>Spring somehow got lost in the weekend's extreme temperature swing.</p>
<p>On Sunday, temps reached a summer-like high of 25 C. Then a vigorous cold front slammed through the city around 6:30 p. m.</p>
<p>The temperature at the <span class="companylink">Calgary International Airport</span> was 24 Cat 6 p. m. Sunday, but slumped to 18 C by 6:38 p. m.</p>
<p>By early Monday morning, the mercury had plunged to a wintry -1 C, said Environment Canada meteorologist Andy Yun.</p>
<p>"It's not a great way to end the long weekend, but it's not unusual for Alberta."</p>
<p>May is a tricky time of year, Yun said, as warm, moisture-laden air from the Pacific collides with icy arctic air to produce dramatic disturbances.</p>
<p>Still, a daytime temperature hovering around zero didn't deter enthusiastic Calgary gardeners on Monday.</p>
<p>"(Business)has been unexpectedly strong," said owner Nick Zannis of Golden Acre Garden Sentre. "We gave several staff the day off and now the parking lot is 80 per cent full and there are lineups."</p>
<p>Rav Saini had planned to go golfing on Monday, but his game was rained out.</p>
<p>Instead, he found himself at Golden Acre pushing a cart laden with marigolds, begonias and impatiens. He had no plans to rush home and stick them outside.</p>
<p>After gardening in Calgary for the past 25 seasons, Saini has learned to buy now for the best selection, stow the tender bedding plants in his garage and plant them in warmer weather.</p>
<p>He may be waiting until June.</p>
<p>Yun said the forecast calls for cool, unstable weather until Thursday, when things should return to normal with a forecast high of 15 C.</p>
<p>Almost as tough as predicting the weather in Alberta is forecasting what lies ahead for the province's tourism business this summer.</p>
<p>The global recession, the spread of the H1N1 influenza virus and the fact American tourists--Alberta's biggest market--will require a pass-ports to re-enter the United States come June 1 are raining on the parade that was the tourism boom in the province.</p>
<p>"The last two years have been very positive, but we're now entering a period of uncertainty," said Don Boynton, a spokesman for Travel Alberta.</p>
<p>Results of a pre-season survey pre-pared for Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation showed the first quarter of 2009 has been a difficult time for many operators as tourism numbers are down compared with last year at this time.</p>
<p>However, Boynton said the tourism industry was able to bounce back from "the perfect storm" of 2003, when SARS, mad cow disease, West Nile virus, forest fires in southern Alberta and a restructuring of Air Canada conspired to knock 20 per cent off tourism spending in the province.</p>
<p>"Ninety per cent of operators are still in the business today, showing that the industry can adapt quickly," he said.</p>
<p>"The one certain thing about weather in Alberta is that it will change, and the dynamic travel industry here reflects that, too."</p>

<p>As H1N1 creeps slowly across our lands, we are becoming more anxious and willing to part with millions of dollars to combat it. But every day, more than 25,000 kids under five die of preventable causes, and more than two billion people have no access to effective medicines.</p>
<p>We have a made-in-Canada solution but, for four years, it has languished in bureaucracy. Canada's Access to Medicines Regime became law May 14, 2005, and, so far, only one company has produced one inexpensive generic drug for HIV/AIDS treatment in Africa.</p>
<p>The Senate has produced an excellent revision to kick-start the moribund generic drug law. Bill S-232 will make it easier for developing countries to apply for, and Canadian companies to produce, effective drugs affordable for the poorest.

<p>N ews that travel limitations to Mexico were lifted Monday as the H1N1 flu appears to be"levelling off" is little consolation for Calgarians Richard and Jennifer Girvitz.</p>
<p>The couple had planned to exchange their wedding vows on a white sandy beach in the sun-soaked Mayan Riviera, while later dining on fresh fruit and grilled salmon.</p>
<p>Instead, after their airline cancelled their flight to Mexico, the Girvitzes ended up getting married in a Calgary community hall May 7 while it rained and hailed outside and the guests ate takeout pizza.</p>
<p>"It wasn't the wedding we wanted,"said Richard Girvitz, 29. "We had our dream wedding planned and then we were dealt a major blow."</p>
<p>At the time, the couple understood the decision by the airlines to limit non-essential travel to Mexico, given the growing number of flu cases and the rising alert level by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Girvitz said: "It was obviously a huge overreaction."</p>
<p>Calgarian Shannon Rapp agrees.</p>
<p>Her father spent more than $10,000 on an all-inclusive trip for him and six family members to visit the Mayan Riviera for a week at the beginning of May.</p>
<p>"Everything was so hyped up, it was going to be a global pandemic and everyone was so worried," said Rapp, 33.</p>
<p>"Then, once the trips were cancelled, you didn't hear anything more about it. It seems like it was a big deal for nothing."</p>
<p>The cancellations left many travellers scrambling to make alternative plans or try to get refunds.</p>
<p>Both Rapp's father and the Girvitzes are still trying to get their money back.</p>
<p>Limitations for Canadians travelling to and from Mexico were lifted Monday as the flu appears to be" levelling off" in the country where it was first discovered earlier this spring.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, told reporters in a conference call that with the current knowledge of the swine flu, or H1N1 virus, it does not make sense to maintain a non-essential travel restriction to Mexico.</p>
<p>"The virus, as it spreads in Canada, the United States and internationally, is more along the lines of the severity we see with the seasonal flu,"Butler-Jones said. "In addition, the outbreak in Mexico seems to be levelling off, so as we get more understanding of this virus, it does not make sense to have a travel warning to a country where the virus is spreading similar to in Canada.</p>
<p>"We no longer feel it is necessary to say, 'Wait until we know more,' because initially the issue was that in Mexico, we were seeing an initial presentation of a very severe disease in a fair number of people," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"As we come to understand this virus better, and as we see the cases that have come back to Canada being a milder form, it does not make sense to have that travel warning in place. It did make sense at the time given what we didn't know, but given what we know now, it's time to regularize things."</p>
<p>On April 28, airlines including Air Canada and Calgary-based WestJet announced they would join several other carriers in suspending flights to Mexico due to the flu scare.</p>
<p>On Monday, a WestJet spokesman said there are no plans to resume flying to Mexico any earlier than June 20.</p>
<p>"We're having meetings this week to talk about ramping back up," said Robert Palmer, "but resuming flights earlier has not been mentioned so far."</p>
<p>Palmer said it will take the airline several weeks to return to its normal flight plans for Mexico.</p>
<p>"It takes that long to gear up operationally and to make the craft available," he said.</p>
<p>There are currently 520 confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada, according to individual reports from the provinces and territories.</p>
<p>Globally, the World Health Organization reports more than 8,800 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, resulting in 74 deaths. The U.S., with more than 4,700 cases, represents the highest number of confirmed cases, followed by Mexico, which has more than 3,100 cases and represents the majority of the fatal cases, with 68.</p>
<p>Despite the change of plans, Richard Girvitz said he and his new wife are happy with the way their wedding turned out after all.</p>
<p>"We were dealt a major curveball and even though it didn't turn out the way we wanted it to, in the end it probably turned out better," he said.</p>
<p>"We could have postponed the wedding, or gone somewhere else but we both wanted to move forward and get married, so we made the most of it."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Butler-Jones said people should remain diligent in protecting themselves, especially if they are vulnerable to illness.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer says the country has seen the worst of the H1N1 flu -- for now.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones told reporters yesterday that it appears the virus is starting to wane for this season.</p>
<p>"It looks at this point like we're over the worst of it in Canada for this season,'' he said.</p>
<p>"But, again, I'm going to hedge my bets on that because we're watching very closely and it's still within the incubation period of previous cases, so you could see a second spike.</p>
<p>"But, so far, we've not seen that . . . and the peak does appear to be -- in all three countries, actually, Mexico, the United States and Canada -- largely toward the end of April, beginning of May.''</p>
<p>Canada is lifting an advisory against non-essential travel to Mexico as cases of H1N1 flu there start to level off.</p>
<p>The federal government says travel to Mexico -- the epicentre of the swine subtype of H1N1 -- is no longer a risk to Canadians since the virus has been spreading through Canada for some time.</p>
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency will continue to visually check travellers for signs of illness.</p>

</p>
<p>As the World Health Organization inched closer yesterday to raising the infectious disease alert level to its highest stage -- and to a decision on whether to manufacture a vaccine against the novel H1N1 influenza virus -- some delegates to the WHO congress in Geneva urged the agency to change its criteria for increasing the alert level.</p>
<p>Current rules call for the alert to be raised to Phase 6 if community transmission of the new virus is observed in two WHO regions. So far, such transmission has been observed only in North America, which accounts for about 95 per cent of the nearly 9,000 confirmed infections that have been observed.</p>
<p>But an outbreak of the virus in Japan detected over the weekend hints that such transmission soon might be observed in Asia as well. Japanese authorities said yesterday in Tokyo that there have been 135 confirmed cases of H1N1 influenza in schools in Kobe and Osaka, mostly among students and their family members who have not visited North America, suggesting that the virus might have been transmitted locally.</p>
<p>Authorities have ordered more than 1,000 schools in those cities closed in an effort to contain the outbreak.</p>
<p>Other pockets of infection have been observed in Spain, with 103 confirmed infections, and Britain, with 82. The WHO has been monitoring the situation closely in all three countries, but so far "we don't see sustained community spread,'' WHO spokesperson Dick Thompson said. Several cases also have been observed in South America, and officials are keeping an eye there as well because that hemisphere is just now entering its flu season, providing fertile ground for the virus to spread.</p>
<p>In Canada, there has so far been a confirmed total of 520 cases -- including one death -- of the strain of H1N1. Nearly all the cases have been mild.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>On reserves, kids killing selves - A DISTURBING HISTORY: Suicides on Manitoba reserves Desperate officials write Ottawa for help, await response to tragedies</b>
</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch   </div>
<div>873 words</div><div>19 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Three children have committed suicide in Pukatawagan in recent months and many more have tried, prompting the northwestern Manitoba First Nation community to beg Ottawa for help.</p>
<p>Provincial Children's Advocate Billie Schibler said two children from the chronically troubled reserve of Shamattawa on the other side of the province have also taken their lives so far this year.</p>
<p>That's despite pledges by the federal and provincial governments to get serious about the issue of aboriginal suicide.</p>
<p>"We've heard so much about swine flu -- that's all we've heard about for weeks. But there is suicide after suicide in aboriginal communities and you don't ever hear about those," said Sandi Rhodes, Pukatawagan's director of education. "If these were happening in Boissevain or Brandon, there would be an uproar. I'm very angry and I'm ashamed to say it, but I wonder if the attitude is 'this is just another dead Indian.' "</p>
<p>The most recent death happened late last month when a 13-year-old boy hanged himself in Pukatawagan. The boy was from a good family and showed no outward signs of emotional troubles. His family says he died as a result of a "blackout" game that involves choking, but RCMP, the band and the children's advocate consider the death a suicide. That has left the community of 1,500 people desperate for help and fearful of the next suicide.</p>
<p>Two more teens committed suicide last October within days of each other. Staff in Pukatawagan say more than two dozen other children and teens in 11 northern reserves have committed suicide in the last year while federal politicians do little.</p>
<p>Rhodes, along with Chief Arlen Dumas and the band council, wrote to Indian and Northern Affairs Canada and to Health Canada's First Nation and Inuit Health Branch this month begging for more access to long-term counselling, a suicide prevention curriculum in schools, clinical experts, grief counsellors and training for teachers so they can recognize suicidal students.</p>
<p>"There's just not enough attention being given to the issue," Dumas said. "We know what to do. We just need the personnel to get it done."</p>
<p>Pukatawagan has yet to receive a response to the two-page letter.</p>
<p>INAC had nothing to say about the deaths. In an emailed response, Health Canada said it funds a wellness worker and a full-time counsellor on the reserve, along with various community programs like the National Aboriginal Youth Suicide Prevention Strategy, National Native Alcohol and Drug Abuse Program and Brighter Futures.</p>
<p>Following the 13-year-old boy's death, mental health therapists were sent to Pukatawagan by the federal and provincial governments to help residents, and the provincial government is developing a crisis team able to deploy to communities later in 2009.</p>
<p>Manitoba's senior federal minister, Treasury Board President Vic Toews, did not return a call for comment, nor did Tory MP Rod Bruinooge, who has been his party's point man on aboriginal issues in Manitoba, or Tory MP Steven Fletcher, the former parliamentary secretary to the minister of health.</p>
<p>"Certainly there's no response in terms of a longer-term prevention program," said Churchill NDP MP Niki Ashton. "What's so shocking is the lack of action on such a large scale."</p>
<p>The latest rash of suicides in Pukatawagan echoes a familiar refrain from Manitoba's poverty-stricken reserves.</p>
<p>Seven years ago, Shamattawa was in the news after nearly 40 adults and children attempted suicide and at least three succeeded.</p>
<p>maryagnes.welch@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Shamattawa, 2002</p>
<p>In just over a week in July, three people committed suicide and another 39 tried. That sparked the same kind of temporary fix reserves have seen for decades. Ottawa and the province spent $100,000 to fast-track a one-year suicide prevention program that featured counsellors and a visit from aboriginal singer Susan Aglukark. The money also established a healing centre that was funded for just two years and then fizzled. Tracia Owen Inquest, 2008</p>
<p>The 14-year-old from Grand Rapids First Nation hanged herself in 2005 in a West End garage, the victim of sexual abuse, sexual exploitation and a child welfare system that failed her. In a stern report, provincial court Judge John Guy laid out 28 recommendations to improve social and child welfare services on reserves and in Winnipeg. The report prompted the province to create a series of programs in Winnipeg to combat sexual exploitation, but little has changed back on the reserves. Shamattawa, 2008</p>
<p>In May, four kids attempted suicide. The youngest was nine. They were among the 47 people who attempted to kill themselves in the first five months of the year. More than six months after news of the suicide crisis hit the news, the Manitoba government unveiled an $8-million plan to create a youth crisis centre in Thompson and a mobile crisis unit able to travel to reserves. However, that money is spread over four years and has barely started being spent. Ottawa was virtually silent on the crisis.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer says the country has seen the worst of the swine flu -- for now.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said yesterday it appears spread of the virus is waning.</p>
<p>"It looks at this point like we're over the worst of it in Canada for this season," he said. "But, again, I'm going to hedge my bets on that because we're watching very closely and it's still within the incubation period of previous cases, so you could see a second spike."</p>
<p>There has so far been a confirmed total of 520 cases -- including one death -- of the strain of H1N1 in Canada. Nearly all the cases have been mild.</p>
<p>The virus seemingly peaked around the end of last month and the beginning of this one, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"Once we've been a couple of weeks past the presentation of cases, etc., and we see the numbers, then we can say with some confidence that we're over the worst," he said. "We seem to be trending in that way, but we'll have to wait and see over the next few days."</p>
<p>Some health officials have suggested the virus isn't likely to peter out over the summer as flu strains tend to do when the mercury soars in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones didn't rule out more cases over the summer and a resurgence in the fall.</p>
<p>"We are suspecting that this will be back in the fall, given how widely it's spread so far," he said.</p>
<p>"We need to be planning for that, including the development of vaccines and other things."</p>
<p>The federal government has signed a contract with pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to produce a new vaccine for swine flu when one is developed, Butler-Jones said. Every Canadian is covered for two doses of the vaccine under that deal.</p>
<p>Federal scientists are working on a vaccine strain at the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Another sign spread of swine flu virus is tapering off, Ottawa lifted its advisory against nonessential travel to Mexico yesterday.</p>
<p>The federal government says travel to Mexico -- the centre of the swine subtype of H1N1 -- is no longer a risk to Canadians since the virus has been spreading through Canada for some time.</p>
<p>The Canada Border Services Agency will continue to check travellers visually for signs of illness.</p>
<p>But the Public Health Agency of Canada will cease some Mexico-specific travel measures such as distributing health alert notices to passengers on direct flights to Mexico and having quarantine officers meet every direct flight entering Canada from Mexico.</p>
<p>News of lifting the travel advisory comes as Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq attends the annual World Health Assembly in Geneva.</p>
<p>Several countries -- including China, Britain and Japan -- urged the World Health Organization against raising the swine flu alert to the highest level.</p>
<p>WHO director general Dr. Margaret Chan agreed to keeping the alert level at the Phase 5 -- one level short of a worldwide pandemic.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said Canada was one of the countries pushing for the WHO to take into account the severity of the illness, not just how quickly it was spreading.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>One person's poison could be another's cure; Dengue fever outbreak in Australia prompts a contrary approach</b>
</div><div>Stuart Laidlaw   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>724 words</div><div>19 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>It takes a village to kill a fever.</p>
<p>That, at least, is the simple idea behind a research project in Queensland, Australia. Dengue fever has ravaged the population there and scientist Paul Young is trying to develop a rather counterintuitive vaccine that does nothing to help the person who actually gets the shot.</p>
<p>In fact, he says, the best way to stop the fever is to not treat people when they get sick, other than alleviating their symptoms, but to give them a vaccine that stops the disease from spreading to other people.</p>
<p>Dubbed an "altruistic vaccine," it poisons the blood of people with dengue fever, killing the mosquitoes that spread the disease before they can fly away and infect another person.</p>
<p>It's a relatively new idea, and one that has attracted the attention of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (of <span class="companylink">Microsoft Corp</span>. fame), which has donated $100,000 (U.S.) to Young's research.</p>
<p>"I am thrilled to have received this grant, as it will allow us to kick-start a new an untested strategy for disease control," Young said in a news release from Queensland University, where he teaches at the School of Chemistry and Molecular Biosciences.</p>
<p>Dengue is a flu-like disease spread by mosquitoes. It usually starts as a sudden high fever, rash, severe headache, and pain behind the eyes and in muscles and joints. Nausea, vomiting and loss of appetite are common. Dengue hemorrhagic fever is a severe, often fatal, complication.</p>
<p>There is no specific treatment or vaccine. The fever's spread is fought by getting rid of mosquitoes either with pesticides or by draining standing water wherever possible.</p>
<p>"Mosquito-transmitted pathogens such as dengue and malaria are a significant disease burden on society, particularly in the developing world," Young points out.</p>
<p>To get the money, he wrote a two-page description of how his idea falls outside current scientific paradigms and might lead to significant advances in global health, a requirement for the Gates funding.</p>
<p>There is an altruistic element to most vaccination programs, says Angus Dawson, a visiting senior research fellow at University of Toronto's Joint Centre for Bioethics.</p>
<p>Traditional vaccines, he says, offer more than just protection for those getting the shot. They also help stop the spread of a disease to other people and that's why governments back vaccination programs.</p>
<p>"The primary objective is to protect the population," Dawson says.</p>
<p>Altruistic vaccines take that principle one step farther by offering no personal protection to the person getting the medication, only a channel to help stop the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>"You have to switch from thinking purely about personal benefit," says Dawson, founding director of the Centre for Professional Ethics at Keele University in Britain.</p>
<p>Young's project is one of 81 chosen by the Gates Foundation from more that 3,000 international proposals.</p>
<p>Among the chosen 81 ideas are a British idea to use magnets to diagnose malaria, a New Jersey project to develop a tomato that delivers antiviral drugs, and a Tanzanian plan to design a better mosquito trap.</p>
<p>Dengue afflicts between 50 million and 100 million people a year, mostly in tropical areas. The disease has been spreading in recent years in the Queensland area of northeast Australia.</p>
<p>A recent study, also involving Queensland University researchers, suggests it will soon be a bigger problem, because of global warming. The study, published in the journal PLoS Neglected Tropical Diseases, predicted dengue fever could be in Australia's major cities by 2050.</p>
<p>Efforts to deal with global warming by stockpiling water are only increasing the risk, the study said, because mosquitoes breed in stagnant water.</p>
<p>"Our summers already provide ideal conditions for dengue transmission around the country, but the introduction of government-subsidized water storage devices now adds the ideal breeding ground for the dengue mosquito to re-emerge," lead researcher Nigel Beebe said.</p>
<p>The Queensland area is experiencing its worst dengue outbreak in 50 years, with more than 900 cases reported already in 2009, making the fever a far greater threat to the country than swine flu, Beebe said.</p>

<p>Peru called out riot police to control hundreds of young girls swarming the hotel in Lima where the Jonas Brothers are staying. Thousands of other fans have lined up for the group's world tour premiere.</p>
<p>The boy band is performing two concerts in Lima because a concert in Mexico was postponed owing to the swine flu epidemic. The first Lima concert sold out in hours and 60,000 people were expected for each show yesterday and today.</p>
<p>Police blocked off traffic on Sunday as more than 1,000 fans met Nick, Joe and Kevin Jonas at the oceanfront Marriot Hotel. Dozens of girls slept in a park outside the hotel to be close to their idols.</p>
<p>"What a great way to start off our new world tour," the group posted on its website yesterday.</p>

</p>
<p>The United States is a great sporting nation and, as a result, Americans like keeping score and handicapping most public events. The performance of their presidents is no exception and, since the early days of the Roosevelt presidency, the media have marked the first 100 days by providing a report card based on their performance.</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that no other U.S. president has arrived in office with higher expectations than Barack Obama, and more difficult problems. It is, therefore, not surprising that he has been subjected to a steeper learning curve than his predecessors.</p>
<p>By the time Obama was sworn in on Jan. 20, the U.S. financial system was in freefall, the credit markets were becoming unglued, house prices were tumbling, and a half-dozen foreign hotspots required presidential attention. It is difficult to imagine how it could have been more challenging.</p>
<p>Since the 100-day mark is an artificial marker, the White House staff was reluctant to join in on the rating game but their efforts proved futile.</p>
<p>Once they realized that it was going to be impossible to blunt the media's interest in rating the administration's performance, some senior staff tried, albeit unsuccessfully, to lower the public's expectations regarding Obama's early accomplishments by assigning themselves a B-plus. And finally, the White House embraced the 100-day anniversary, with the president appearing at last month's 100-day town hall celebration in St. Louis.</p>
<p>At this point, given all of the challenges and difficulties encountered by Obama, he remains a very popular political leader. In fact, according to the Pew Foundation, his personal popularity is higher than the ratings for his individual programs.</p>
<p>However, there is a very wide gap in the perceptions of Democrats and Republicans, suggesting that he might be one of the most polarizing presidents when compared with his predecessors. This may foreshadow future political tensions in the United States.</p>
<p>While not popular with Republicans, Obama appears to have precipitated a dramatic shift in attitude in favour of a greater role for government in the United States and may be giving a new name to the notion of activism.</p>
<p>Most observers attribute the positive rankings to Obama's personal style. He offers calm leadership that is heavily dependent on teamwork.</p>
<p>It is generally acknowledged that his eclectic team of advisers has two characteristics. First, they represent a wide range of ideological beliefs that appears to have broad appeal, and they seek a consensus among key decision makers before they act. In addition, he prefers to signal his intentions and his overall policy direction, but is reluctant to dictate how the policy will be implemented. At this point, he is perfectly willing to allow Congress to sort out how his policies will be implemented.</p>
<p>Ironically, some observers have noted that his approach to governing is the one used by Ronald Reagan more than a generation ago.</p>
<p>Former Clinton labour secretary, Robert Reich, may have captured best Obama's "cool" approach to governing when he described the president as being "the serene centre of the cyclone -- exuding calm when most Americans are petrified."</p>
<p>While management style is obviously an important factor, America has also changed its attitudes since George W. Bush was first elected in 2000. The American population is aging and appears more predisposed to accept an increased role for government.</p>
<p>Given the obvious failure of the Bush administration to buffer Americans from the impact of unfettered markets, it is not surprising that Obama has been very effective in changing the conversation with Americans and bringing in a new paradigm about governing that includes a broader role for government.</p>
<p>The swine flu epidemic that is sweeping across the world is a good example of how events can upset the best plans of newly elected governments. The American political system replaces its senior managers after each change of administration but this time it has been severely handicapped during this crisis period.</p>
<p>More significant, the epidemic has also exposed the weaknesses of the American transition process that requires it to replace the top 7,000 public servants.</p>
<p>The complex vetting procedures in addition to the generally cumbersome appointment process has created a backlog of appointments that is undermining the government's ability to respond to its various challenges.</p>
<p>For example, at this point, the Obama administration has still to fill around 15 senior executive health jobs, with a similar number of vacancies at the Treasury department.</p>
<p>One observer noted that "we're setting up a system where the only people who qualify to work in government are the ones who never actually left government."</p>
<p>Trapped between retaining the former Bush-appointed administrators or following a lengthy search process to find suitable replacements, the government remains leaderless in too many important departments.</p>
<p>While the first 100 days are not a very good predictor of what's to come, it's clear that the public is currently content with Obama's performance.</p>
<p>He has introduced a new vocabulary and style to governing and he evidently understands Prof. Drew Westen's observation that citizens want to hear values-based and emotionally compelling narratives from their political leaders.</p>
<p>As in Canada, Americans want to be reassured that their leadership can feel their pain and is working in their interests.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>There's no reason to succumb to 'swine flu fever'</b>
</div><div>Paula Simons   </div>

</p>
<p>Last week, I popped into a drug store to buy shampoo and toothpaste. All through the store, there were tables with stocks of hand sanitizer, and signs out imploring all customers coming into the store to disinfect their hands. The air was filled with the smell of fake watermelon, fake grapefruit, fake cucumber, and all the other esters that are supposed to cover up that acrid hand sanitizer smell.</p>
<p>As I paid for my purchases, the clerk tried to sell me hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>"We're almost sold out," she whispered conspiratorially. "These are our last three bottles. Buy it while you still can."</p>
<p>A couple days later, I stopped by a Mexican-style take-out restaurant to pick up a burrito for lunch. On the counter was a sign, assuring customers that even though the restaurant had a Mexican name, its food was safe and flu-free.</p>
<p>I'll admit, my first temptation is to make fun of all the people who've succumbed to swine flu fever. But really, that's a little unfair. It's hard to blame people for being nervous when the media, the marketers, the politicians and even the World Health Organization have spent the last few weeks whipping up fears about H1N1 as a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The wonder is that more people weren't more spooked.</p>
<p>Alberta officials have been taking a lot of political heat for their handling of the H1N1 outbreak in that province. They've been chastised for not being more forthcoming with information about victims, for not notifying parents whose children attend school with kids who've become ill, for not closing schools, for not telling the press immediately when a northern Alberta woman with chronic respiratory problems died after catching the flu.</p>
<p>But I'm not sure that criticism is warranted.</p>
<p>So far, H1N1 has shown itself no more virulent, deadly, or contagious than the seasonal flu bugs we see most winters.</p>
<p>Imagine the chaos, if we closed an elementary school every time some kid showed up with influenza or Norovirus. Imagine the fear, if every parent were notified in writing of every classmate's sniffle.</p>
<p>Despite the international media hype, we are not facing some latter-day Andromeda Strain, or even a repeat of the deadly SARS outbreak. Even if this influenza were more serious, we'd still need to be making decisions on the basis of the best scientific and medical advice -- not for political reasons. Swine flu, or H1N1, or whatever we want to call it, is frightening people mostly because it's new. And because we've all been told for years now that one day, some big bad flu pandemic, akin to the great Spanish Influenza, was going to hit and kill millions. Unfortunately for those trying to sell hand sanitizer, and newspapers, this ain't no Spanish flu.</p>
<p>That's not to say that H1N1 isn't worth monitoring, as a new and exotic influenza mutation. It has spread broadly and quickly, infecting people (and pigs) who've never been to Mexico, and making a very few extremely ill indeed.</p>
<p>But in some ways, it is the virus's relative mildness that has let it spread so far and wide.</p>
<p>If it made people sicker, they'd stay in bed, instead of boarding planes or going to work.</p>
<p>A truly ghastly virus like Ebola, for example, doesn't spread quickly or far, because it kills its victims so swiftly. The common cold, on the other hand, spreads like crazy, because we shrug it off, and go out and sneeze on people. Luckily for us, and unluckily for those in the fear-fanning business, this Mexican bug has far more in common with the latter than the former. We could look at the last couple of weeks as a useful drill for health-care workers, to practice their epidemic protocols.</p>
<p>Someday, there probably will be a truly deadly flu mutation, one that will indeed call for us to go into lockdown mode.</p>
<p>But when it comes, will people be so bored, so fatigued by false alarms, that they miss the warning signs of the big one when it really comes?</p>
<p>Just as bacterial infections can evolve to be antibiotic-resistant, might we evolve socially, to be resistant to recognizing real risk when it arrives?</p>
<p>So here's my cheery prescription. Instead of feeding on fear, why not feed on pork? If you're not Jewish, Muslim, vegetarian or otherwise pork-averse, this would be an excellent time to show your support for pig farmers, large and small, who've been victimized by irrational international import bans, and decreased local demand.</p>
<p>I feel particularly sorry for Alberta farmer Arnold Van Ginkel, who played by the rules and reported his sick pigs, instead of taking the "shoot, shovel and shut up" approach -- and who is now paying a heavy price for his probity.</p>

<p>When news of the Mexican swine flu outbreak hit in late April, it sent Charles Hurdon scrambling.</p>
<p>The employment lawyer at <span class="companylink">Ogilvy Renault</span> in Ottawa had two clients with employees returning from a Mexican vacation and the companies didn't know what to do with them. Did they allow them to come back to work and possibly infect colleagues if it turns out they had the flu, or did they make them stay at home?</p>
<p>"They did not have policies in relation to a possible outbreak [of a disease]," he said. The law firm helped the businesses cobble together policies and quickly implement them.</p>
<p>It's a task that has been going on around the country, since the World Health Organization raised its Pandemic Alert to Phase 5 in response to the outbreak of the H1N1 virus in Mexico. At Phase 5, a pandemic--a global outbreak of a disease -- is considered imminent and level six is the highest alert issued by WHO.</p>
<p>As of May 14, there have been 449 confirmed cases in Canada and one death attributed to swine flu. Ontario reports the highest number of cases at 155, followed by British Columbia (96), Alberta (67) and Nova Scotia (66).</p>
<p>Globally, the H1N1 virus has infected more than 5,251 people in 30 countries, and killed at least 56 people in Mexico. The U. S. has reported more than 2,600 cases and three deaths. About 4,000 Canadians die each year related to some form of flu virus.</p>
<p>While companies should not panic at the latest outbreak, Dominique Monet, a labour lawyer at <span class="companylink">Fasken Martineau</span> DuMoulin in Montreal, said "once the public health authorities get into the fray and issue statements, it becomes a matter of interest to employers."</p>
<p>"This is a good time to look over policies regarding sick leave and paid time off and that sort of thing."</p>
<p>A guide for pandemic planning from the Human Resources Professionals of Ontario, drafted in response to the Avain flu scare (H5N1 strain) of a few years ago, highlights why employers need to pay attention to potential pandemics and plan for them in the same way the develop business continuity plans for disasters.</p>
<p>According to the report the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-19 killed 30,000 to 50,000 Canadians and "an influenza pandemic would have serious consequences in Canada."</p>
<p>It cites Health Canada figures that estimate in a major influenza pandemic between 4.5 to 10 million Canadians --15% to 35% of the population -- would be sick enough that they couldn't attend work for at least a half day. Between 2.1 and five million Canadians would require outpatient care and 34,000 to 138,000 would require hospitalization. An estimated 11,000 to 60,000 could die. A major flu pandemic could affect the country for up to a year.</p>
<p>The report also noted companies face a double whammy, with people too sick to work, and other employees booking off to tend to their sick loved ones.</p>
<p>Absenteeism rates could hit between 30% and 50% for a major pandemic, and Mercer Human Resource Consulting suggested companies should plan for absenteeism rates of 20% to 60% for periods of two to four weeks at the height of each wave during an outbreak.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said on its Web site "it is too soon to say whether we will see an escalation in severity of illness" stemming from the current swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Hurdon said, companies shouldn't ignore the situation. He said large organizations that have employees who travel frequently, and which already operate in multiple jurisdictions, aren't the problem. They are sophisticated and have policies in place.</p>
<p>The problem is small and mid-sized firms, he said. Many haven't put their minds to the troubles that could arise in a pandemic.</p>
<p>Under provincial labour laws, companies must take reasonable steps to protect employees. In a pandemic situation, Mr. Hurdon said, that likely means employers have an obligation to prevent the spread of influenza in the workplace. In the case of returning vacationers who visited a hotspot, it could mean giving them additional time off on the employer's tab. Same for an employee who exhibits signs of the illness. It could also affect operations if too many people become sick and a company has to shut down.</p>
<p>Kevin Coon, an employment lawyer at <span class="companylink">Baker & McKenzie</span> in Toronto, said employers "don't want to create hysteria in the workplace." If someone exhibits flu symptoms, "you can request [that person] provide you with a medical certificate indicating they are medically fit to return to work."</p>
<p>Businesses need to examine what type of short-term disability plans they have in place, he said, because a pandemic could cause people to claim against them. Same with emergency leave policies. They should also check their workplaces to ensure ventilation is up to standards and policies are in place to encourage good hygiene.</p>
<p>Employees have a right to refuse work that is unsafe, so businesses could face more disputes as employees refuse to travel on business or work with colleagues who exhibit signs of illness.</p>
<p>Mr. Coon also had a warning for companies with operations in Mexico trying to send flu medicine to employees across the Mexican border: "Mexico has some fairly stringent restrictions about importing of medications," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Monet warned employers must also be cognizant of privacy laws and protecting the confidential medical information of employees during a breakout. Companies should also see what access to medical doctors or clinics they have. "There is going to be a hell of a demand on our health services [in a pandemic]," he said. "If you start having a breakout it is going to be an unstable ride."</p>

<p>A New York City school principal with swine flu died Sunday, becoming the city's first death due to H1N1 flu, medical officials said. Mitchell Wiener, 55, died after being admitted to Flushing Hospital Medical Center several days ago with the H1N1 flu virus, said Dr. Andrew Rubin, a hospital spokesman. A city health spokeswoman also confirmed the death, but could not confirm the victim's identity. It was the first death in New York City, where many of the U.S. cases have been reported, but with mostly mild symptoms.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pneumonia: The new bane of baby boomers?; More people seem to suffer from it, but no one tracks the numbers</b>
</div><div>Shelley Fralic   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>534 words</div><div>18 May 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>There was a time when a bad bout of pneumonia wasn't just miserable, it was fatal. In fact, a century ago, it held the title as the leading cause of death in North America, when modern medicine was but a dream, and life expectancy tapped out at 50.</p>
<p>But that was then, and this is now.</p>
<p>Like so many grave ailments of long ago, including polio and tuberculosis, pneumonia seems vanquished -- except for isolated outbreaks, and its threat to the old, the frail, and the immuno-compromised.</p>
<p>Pneumonia, at least in modern times, has rarely ailed the healthy. How, then, to explain that big blip on the radar this flu season, when you, and everyone else you know, especially baby boomers, seems to be recovering from pneumonia?</p>
<p>It may not be SARS or H1N1, but pneumonia -- essentially, inflammation of the lung -- is worth taking seriously.</p>
<p>For starters, unlike the flu, it doesn't go away after a few days of sloth, fluids and Tylenol. The cough it brings is so wracking, it bruises the chest and back muscles and turns the throat into a sandpaper tract, down which only a straw can comfortably be inserted for sustenance intake. It brings, too, profound weakness, chest pain, a high fever, a pounding headache, and, finally, breathlessness.</p>
<p>Dr. Reka Gustafson, medical health officer with Vancouver Coastal Health, says there's no official indication pneumonia is making a comeback among the healthy. She does say, however, that pneumonia is "not actually reportable."</p>
<p>That's because most of us who recently had pneumonia thought initially it was the flu. Then, one day, when we couldn't catch our breath, we went to the doctor, who made a clinical diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia, wrote a prescription -- and presto! The thing was over in a matter of days, but for the lingering fatigue.</p>
<p>No one, says Gustafson, keeps track of that sort of doctors' office data, and even if a pneumonia sufferer is treated in hospital, that information would also have to be purposefully collated to identify a pattern. And it's not.</p>
<p>"There isn't anybody counting cases of pneumonia," says Gustafson.</p>
<p>She adds that, because one of the precursors to pneumonia is a viral infection, it makes sense there would be more cases during flu season, even for those who are otherwise healthy and have never had it before.</p>
<p>The good news is that pneumonia isn't contagious, because "it's caused by a bug already living in your throat. It's not that you catch pneumonia; it's that you're susceptible to pneumonia."</p>
<p>The bad news? "We sort of think we have conquered it," says Gustafson, "but we haven't."</p>
<p>Which brings us to the needle. My doctor has asked me to return to his cubicle this fall, for a one-time-only pneumonia vaccination. A shot in the dark, perhaps, but one this baby boomer thinks may be worth taking.</p>

<p>Interjet, one of Mexico's few surviving low-cost carriers, plans to tap government emergency funds to stay afloat amid an economic downturn and deadly flu outbreak that spread across several countries.</p>
<p>Toluca-based Interjet estimates the H1N1 virus, which killed more than 60 people in Mexico and sickened thousands more in over 30 countries around the world, may shave half a million passengers from its traffic this year.</p>
<p>Mexico shut down schools, gyms, restaurants, bars, partially halting the economy for around two weeks to curb the contagion. Airlines from several countries also restricted flights to and from Mexico, and many tourists fled back home.</p>
<p>"For 2009, the original budget called for 3.7 million passengers," chief executive Jose Luis Garza said Friday. "We think that the (flu) effect will be 500,000 passengers less."</p>
<p>At the height of the health crisis in the first week of May, Interjet sales dropped by as much as 60 per cent. The company is currently operating at 70 per cent capacity, Garza said.</p>
<p>The company transported three million passengers in 2008.</p>

</p>
<p>Professor of bioethics at Princeton University and laureate professor at the University of Melbourne</p>
<p>The 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant wrote: “Two things fill the heart with ever renewed and increasing awe and reverence, the more often and more steadily we meditate upon them: the starry firmament above and the moral law within.”</p>
<p>This year, the 400th anniversary of Galileo's first use of a telescope, has been declared the International Year of Astronomy, so this seems a good time to ponder Kant's first source of “awe and reverence.” Indeed, the goal of the commemoration – to help the world's citizens “rediscover their place in the universe” – now has the incidental benefit of distracting us from nasty things nearer to home, such as the H1N1 flu and the global financial crisis.</p>
<p>What does astronomy tell us about “the starry firmament above”?</p>
<p>By expanding our grasp of the vastness of the universe, science has, if anything, increased the awe and reverence we feel when we look up on a starry night (assuming, that is, that we have gotten far enough away from air pollution and excessive street lighting to see the stars properly). But, at the same time, our greater knowledge surely forces us to acknowledge that our place in the universe is not particularly significant.</p>
<p>In his essay “Dreams and Facts,” philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote that our entire Milky Way galaxy is a tiny fragment of the universe, and within this fragment our solar system is “an infinitesimal speck,” and within this speck “our planet is a microscopic dot.”</p>
<p>Today, we don't need to rely on such verbal descriptions of our planet's insignificance against the background of our galaxy. The astronomer Carl Sagan suggested that the Voyager space probe capture an image of Earth as it reached the outer reaches of our solar system. It did so in 1990, and Earth shows up in a grainy image as a pale blue dot. If you go to YouTube and search for “Carl Sagan – Pale Blue Dot,” you can see it, and hear Mr. Sagan himself telling us that we must cherish our world because everything humans have ever valued exists only on that pale blue dot.</p>
<p>That is a moving experience, but what should we learn from it?</p>
<p>Russell sometimes wrote as if the fact that we are a mere speck in a vast universe showed that we don't really matter all that much: “On this dot, tiny lumps of impure carbon and water, of complicated structure, with somewhat unusual physical and chemical properties, crawl about for a few years, until they are dissolved again into the elements of which they are compounded.”</p>
<p>But no such nihilistic view of our existence follows from the size of our planetary home, and Russell himself was no nihilist. He thought that it was important to confront the fact of our insignificant place in the universe, because he did not want us to live under the illusory comfort of a belief that somehow the world had been created for our sake, and that we are under the benevolent care of an all-powerful creator. “Dreams and Facts” concludes with these stirring words: “No man is liberated from fear who dare not see his place in the world as it is; no man can achieve the greatness of which he is capable until he has allowed himself to see his own littleness.”</p>
<p>After the Second World War, when the world was divided into nuclear-armed camps threatening each other with mutual destruction, Russell did not take the view that our insignificance, when considered against the vastness of the universe, meant that the end of life on Earth did not matter. On the contrary, he made nuclear disarmament the chief focus of his political activity for the remainder of his life.</p>
<p>Mr. Sagan took a similar view. While seeing the Earth as a whole diminishes the importance of things such as national boundaries that divide us, he said, it also “underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.” Al Gore used the “pale blue dot” image at the end of his film, An Inconvenient Truth, suggesting that if we wreck this planet, we have nowhere else to go.</p>
<p>That's probably true, even though scientists are now discovering other planets outside our solar system. Perhaps one day we will find that we are not the only intelligent beings in the universe, and perhaps we will be able to discuss issues of interspecies ethics with such beings.</p>
<p>This brings us back to Kant's other object of reverence and awe, the moral law within. What would beings with a completely different evolutionary origin from us – perhaps not even carbon-based life forms – think of our moral law?</p>

<p>Abnormally high numbers of influenza cases have medical experts fearing that the spread of swine flu will not ease in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Some health officials are now planning for the possibility the new virus will continue to trigger infections into the summer, not peter out in the way seasonal flu strains typically do as temperatures rise in the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>"This is what worries me," says Dr. Arnold Monto, an influenza expert at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health.</p>
<p>"We are seeing a fair amount of circulation of the swine flu virus. And I'm not yet convinced that it's going to go away completely.</p>
<p>"It may dampen down a bit as schools close. But I think we're still seeing increasing transmission in the U.S. And I think in addition you have far more transmission in Canada than some people are saying."</p>
<p>Dr. Allison McGeer, of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, says abnormal flu activity levels for this time of year are making her question "the delusion that this was actually going to quiet down and we weren't going to have a first wave" over the late spring and summer.</p>
<p>"The last couple of days look like we're going to see a (flu) season," McGeer added.</p>

</p>
<p>Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty put pork on his fork at Queen's Park last week to emphasize that it's safe to eat, despite scares related to swine flu.</p>
<p>"I hope they (the public) are getting that message. It's a simple misconception," he said. "Our food is safe."</p>
<p>Officially called H1N1, the new virus that has been spreading around the world originated in pigs, but experts stress you can't get swine flu from eating cooked pork. There are 3.2 million pigs on Ontario farms.</p>
<p>The premier donned an Ontario Pork apron and disposable gloves to serve a pile of barbecued, glazed, pulled pork on mini-buns at a lunch buffet in the Legislative Building on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It's good. It's not going to hurt you," McGuinty said as he handed a plate to the next man in the lineup. The premier also put the bite on some pork himself.</p>
<p>No fear was evident in the packed room as politicians, staff and pork producers filled up on creations ranging from "piggies in a blanket" to smoked pork belly with apple horseradish cream.</p>
<p>Serving alongside the premier were Agriculture Minister Leona Dombrowsky and Ontario Pork chair Wilma Jeffray.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased with the way the Canadian public has reacted," said Jeffray, a Bruce County hog producer. "Initially, the naming of the flu and the story was a shock."</p>
<p>Jeffray guesses there has been a small decline in retail pork sales in Ontario, but "it hasn't been the drop off the cliff" seen in Canadian exports.</p>
<p>Twenty countries have restricted pork imports from Canada. Jeffray says restrictions, particular in major importers such as Russia, China and South Korea, have hit the industry hard. Hog futures prices have declined 25 per cent in the past two weeks, she says.</p>
<p>Canada exported more than 1 billion kilograms of pork in 2008, according to an industry fact sheet.</p>
<p>Ontario Pork represents 2,800 farmers. Jeffray says they've suffered three straight years of revenue losses. However, 2009 was looking to be a good year - until the swine flu.</p>
<p>"The whole thing puts a cloud of uncertainty in the industry," Jeffray says.</p>
<p>She adds pork farmers and the Ontario government are in discussions about possible financial aid, but could not put a dollar amount on that. When asked about aid, the premier said the question would be considered later.</p>

<p>NEW YORK -- Swine flu virus continues spreading in New York City -- closing more schools and showing up in a jail -- while the disease also reached farther into Asia among travellers returning from the United States.</p>
<p>An assistant school principal in New York remained in hospital in critical condition Saturday and a prisoner who entered the city's jail complex on Rikers Island about a month ago was diagnosed with swine flu Friday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says more than 4,700 confirmed and probable cases have been reported in 46 U.S. states, plus the District of Columbia. Five people have died in the United States, all with underlying ailments.</p>
<p>Internationally, Malaysia, India and Turkey have reported their first cases, all involving people who had travelled from the United States. They are in addition to the 36 other countries where the World Health Organization says more than 8,000 cases of the disease have been confirmed.</p>
<p>Japan on Saturday confirmed its first case of swine flu caught within the country, showing the effort to block the flu at the island country's borders had failed.</p>
<p>The latest confirmed case is Japan's fifth overall. The first four -- three high school students and a teacher -- had recently returned from a school trip to Canada.</p>
<p>Mexico said tests have confirmed two more deaths from swine flu, bringing the country's toll to 68. Health officials say tests confirmed 207 more cases for a total of 3,102, including the deaths.</p>

</p>
<p>The protection of human health is pork's industry's first priority</p>
<p>The Canadian Food and Inspection Agency(CFIA) announced May 2, 2009 that one hog farm in Alberta was quarantined after the H1N1 flu virus was detected in some of the pigs.</p>
<p>None of the hogs from the infected herd have gone to market. Strict food safety standards and protocols are in place at the heart of the pork industry. Along with the proper regulations, these practices prevent meat from any sick animal from entering the food chain.</p>
<p>Only healthy animals are allowed into the food chain</p>
<p>Ill or injured animals are left at the farm prior to shipment and further inspection takes place at the processing facility. All hogs in Canada sent to federally and provincially-inspected processing plants are checked by government veterinarians and inspectors to ensure the animals are healthy and the meat is safe. Unhealthy animals are never allowed into the Canadian food chain.</p>
<p>Hog farmers are diligent about ensuring the health of their livestock and the safety of consumers by participating in on-farm food safety programs. Caring for pigs involves many skills, most importantly the ability to understand their behaviour. Producers carefully observe and inspect their pigs each day in order to identify those that are sick or disadvantaged so they can be given appropriate treatment where necessary. They also ensure that pigs are given the right amount of feed and that they have fresh, clean water at all times.</p>
<p>Strict health and safety practices help to control disease</p>
<p>Pig producers also go to great lengths to protect their herds and practice a number of disease prevention measures. Referred to as biosecurity, these disease prevention efforts protect herd health by preventing the transmission of diseases from outside the farm. Maintaining a high herd health status is important not only to individual producers but to the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>To prevent infection or illness from coming on to their farms, new pigs are kept in a quarantine facility for a month, to ensure there are no health concerns. Extensive measures are taken to keep wild animals, bird and vermin out of hog barns. And any truck collecting pigs from a farm has to be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected, and cannot be carrying any pigs from other farms.</p>
<p>Farmers also stay away from their own hog herds for a 48-hour period after coming in contact with pigs other than their own. In addition to regular hand washing, farmers shower before entry and upon exit of a hog barn. Most barns are equipped with special shower facilities and special clothing to be worn only within the barn. Visitors to farms are kept to a minimum, and visitor logs used.</p>
<p>Producers, veterinarians, industry bodies such as Alberta Pork together with the provincial and federal governments, are committed to ensuring that proper biosecurity protocols are in place at Alberta hog farms. And, in light of the H1N1 virus, producers are increasingly vigilant about hog barn security, redoubling their efforts to actively survey the health of herds to detect any signs of illness.</p>
<p>Our pork industry's on-farm food safety program works</p>
<p>Canadian hog farmers participate in the Canadian Quality Assurance (CQA) program, an on-farm food safety program. The CQA gives consumers greater confidence in pork products by showing what producers do on their farms each and every day to ensure high quality and safety.</p>
<p>Validated by licensed veterinarians, the CQA is based on good science and is built on internationally recognized safety principles. The CQA sets out strict standards regarding on-farm food safety, and ensures extensive record keeping.</p>
<p>Pork producers identify potential hazards that could arise in their operations, and then put controls in place to reduce and eliminate those hazards. It's a proactive approach that puts consumer safety first. Experience shows that it works.</p>
<p>Pork is safe to eat</p>
<p>As stated by the Public Health Agency of Canada, the H1N1 virus is not a food safety concern.</p>
<p>Consumers cannot catch the H1N1 flu virus from consuming or handling pork products. Pork and pork products are safe to eat. Thanks to extensive safety standards and the hard work of Canada's hog farmers, Canadians can have confidence in the high-quality pork that makes it to their plates.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadian Tour looks south; Commissioner Janes is working on getting to Mexico and beyond, but there's still no word on a stop in Ottawa</b>
</div><div>Gord Holder   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>810 words</div><div>17 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>First off, the Canadian Tour has received no reports of staff, officials or players contracting swine flu in Mexico in April.</p>
<p>Even so, deciding to postpone three tournaments and send everyone home was easy, tour commissioner Rick Janes says.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization had issued a Level 4 alert regarding the flu outbreak, on a scale of 1 to 6, and it was starting to look as if air travel to and from Mexico would be shut down.</p>
<p>So, on April 29, one day after saying they would go ahead with the San Luis Potosi Open without spectators and local caddies, and one day before play was to begin, tour officials changed course and added the postponement of that tournament to those announced for the Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open.</p>
<p>By that night, most of the golfers who had been in San Luis Potosi for the second of four Mexican events on the schedule had left the country, and the rest were gone by the next morning.</p>
<p>"A golf tournament is a golf tournament, but getting our players out of there was the absolute priority for us," Janes says from the tour's head office in Oakville, Ont.</p>
<p>Canada still has a travel advisory against non-essential visits to Mexico, and the WHO and Mexican health authorities remain concerned, but the Canadian Tour and the resorts and tourism groups that sponsor tournaments there are thinking about rescheduling the events.</p>
<p>Heck, they might even add another stop on the schedule, extending the season into mid-October, if the health situation improves. Janes expects plans to be finalized by June 1.</p>
<p>"As it turns out, our return to Mexico in the fall is extremely important to them," he says.</p>
<p>There are unintended benefits for some Canadian Tour members because of the postponements.</p>
<p>Golfers who earn playing privileges for the rest of 2009 in this week's spring qualifying tournament at Parksville, B.C., and those who receive 2010 membership status after fall qualifying, which might be moved ahead to early September at Ashburn, Ont., stand to gain an extra three or four opportunities to add official earnings.</p>
<p>In addition, every Canadian Tour member will have an opportunity to play competitive golf into the early fall, "which is actually perfect," Janes says, "in that it goes right up to the start of PGA Tour qualifying school, which is something that we have wanted to do for a great period of time."</p>
<p>Some might wonder whether it's worth the bother to go back to Mexico this year because of lingering health concerns and the duplication of travel costs for officials and tour staff as well as a crew to produce Canadian Tour programming for the Golf Channel.</p>
<p>Still, as Janes says, Mexican tourism agencies are anxious to get things back to normal, and a campaign promoting the tour's return is planned for the Canadian leg of the schedule this summer.</p>
<p>As well, maintaining a Mexican presence fits with the tour's plans to build on alliances outside Canada.</p>
<p>Three tournaments played last November and December in Chile, Argentina and Costa Rica were examples of that, and there could be as many as five events co-sponsored with the Tour de las Americas in 2009. An announcement is expected in July.</p>
<p>In describing what he calls major changes in the world of golf, Janes says the Canadian Tour's expansion into South America "is not by happenstance, and it's very strategic."</p>
<p>Longer term, the Canadian Tour also has ambitions on the home front. Janes hints at the possibility of "really, really exciting stuff" by 2011. He can't talk about them yet, partly because some heavy lifting remains, but he acknowledges that the equation involves elements such as title sponsorship and television.</p>
<p>Then there's the "same old question" about when the tour might return to Ottawa, where it last appeared for the 2001 Eagle Creek Classic. That one, Janes wisecracks, gets the "same old answer."</p>
<p>"Ottawa is still one of the most important markets that we're not in, if not the most important market that we're not in," he says.</p>
<p>That said, there's brewing in terms of returning the tour to the national capital region, though that could change over the next 12 months. The 2011 tour makeover imposes something of a deadline.</p>
<p>"If you're not part of this tour by 2011, it is going to be very difficult to become part of this tour," Janes says.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Virus hunters in overdrive; In a secure lab on CHEO's third floor, technologists are working seven days a week to screen specimens for the swine flu</b>

</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Mexican swine flu, glass test tubes filled with mucus on a swab have been arriving -- by the pair, half-dozen, sometimes three dozen a day -- at the Ottawa laboratory where Susan Laporte works.</p>
<p>"The first few weeks, I think some people were spending most of the day working on these specimens," said Laporte, a medical technologist.</p>
<p>At her covered work station, she dons a face shield, visor, mask, gloves and special protective lab coat before handling the potentially hazardous microbes in those test tubes.</p>
<p>Each one is a question that awaits an urgent answer: Does this "nasopharyngeal swab," collected from the nose and throat of a patient with flu symptoms, test positive for the common strains of influenza that are known to virologists? If not, could this sample contain the new strain of the H1N1 virus that has swept the globe in recent weeks?</p>
<p>The process of elimination falls largely to Laporte and her 11 colleagues at the regional virology lab based at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.</p>
<p>As she sorts and prepares each specimen for diagnostic testing, Laporte's manner is unflappably calm. Anxiety about the swine flu virus may have spread around the world, but within the controlled confines of this lab, there is an air of swift efficiency and detached professionalism as the technologists quietly go about their work.</p>
<p>Since the start of the swine flu outbreak, many of the lab's technologists have taken turns working seven days a week to handle the extra volume of diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>"People are working overtime, for sure," said Tim Karnauchow, the virologist who runs the lab. "We've had to tell people, 'You must keep track of your hours,' because most of them are saying, 'No, this is my duty.' They're very dedicated staff."</p>
<p>Since late April, when the first samples started to trickle in, the lab has served as Eastern Ontario's first line of diagnostic testing, screening specimens from more than 200 patients suspected of having the swine flu.</p>
<p>Typically, during the spring months, about a dozen samples are sent to the lab to be tested for respiratory illnesses. "What this year represents is a respiratory season that refuses to die," said Karnauchow.</p>
<p>The lab, whose budget is administered by CHEO, has so far spent at least $85,000 on swine flu testing, with the hospital expecting the extra costs to be covered by the province.</p>
<p>Indeed, as part of Ontario's pandemic surveillance, doctors have been screening more patients for the swine flu virus, meaning more tests are being ordered for an illness that otherwise shares similar symptoms with more common flu strains.</p>
<p>Samples to the lab have come from hospitals and clinics as far east as Brockville and as far west as the Outaouais. Those samples that are likely to contain the novel virus are sent to the province's main virology lab in Toronto, which performs a final round of tests that can confirm the presence of the swine flu virus.</p>
<p>To date, seven confirmed cases of the novel H1N1 flu have been reported in Ottawa, bringing the provincial total to 187.</p>
<p>Apart from the Toronto lab, only one other facility in the country, the National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg, is equipped with the assays -- and the appropriate level of biosecurity -- to test specifically for the swine flu virus. Ontario's 11 regional labs, including the one at CHEO, help speed the process by screening for more common strains and narrowing the field of culprits.</p>
<p>Because so little is known about the biology of the swine flu virus, the screening process, involving three separate tests that isolate and identify suspect viruses, is far more exhaustive than tests for more common types of respiratory illnesses. It can take up to two weeks, from the time a sample arrives at the regional lab to when a final verdict is issued from Toronto, for results of the swine flu test to reach patients.</p>
<p>On occasion, the tests can take longer. "Viruses, by their very nature, have to be inside a cell in order to grow," said Karnauchow. "If you don't have a sample with enough cells from the nose and back of the throat, which is where the virus infects first, then it's a crappy sample and you'll never find the virus."</p>
<p>For the virus hunters at the regional lab, the extra workload from the swine flu outbreak comes with an added challenge: To provide as speedy and accurate a test result as possible without cutting corners. In this task, they are fighting a public perception, popularized by the TV series, CSI, that complex lab tests can be done within an hour.</p>
<p>"We work very hard to make sure that the answers that we give are accurate, and that takes time," said Karnauchow. "It's a huge frustration to many of us that people do have this sort of notion that, well, in this day and age, science should have all the answers five minutes ago."</p>
<p>The lab, known as a Biosafety Level 2 facility, is tucked in a secure wing on CHEO's third floor.</p>
<p>(A secure Level 3 area, which was used to analyse the SARS virus, holds dangerous pathogens and features filtered air, sealed doors and negative air pressure to prevent germs from leaking out. The highest security level for labs, Biosafety Level 4, is much less common and reserved for the study of exotic viruses and diseases.)</p>
<p>When specimens are delivered to the lab, they are sorted into glass vials and launched simultaneously on a three-pronged testing process. The most basic test involves growing whatever virus is contained in the sample inside a test tube -- an eight-day process that allows technologists to identify the microbe based on the way it grows. "This is the baseline test, but it's not necessarily the most sensitive," said Karnauchow. "It answers a very broad question, which is: Is there a respiratory virus in there?"</p>
<p>The second test -- a more sensitive screen that takes mere hours -- involves isolating a sample virus on a glass slide and incubating it with a antibodies from known flu viruses. Under a microscope, a more common strain of flu virus will bind with the corresponding antibody and glow a fluorescent green, allowing them to rule out swine flu.</p>
<p>By far the most sensitive test involves molecular screening, in which the genetic sequence of the suspect virus is analysed to determine whether it's a known microbe. The molecular assays at the regional lab can pick up human and non-human strains of influenza A, which causes flu in birds and some mammals, as well as influenza B, which is known to infect only humans.</p>
<p>"It's the ultimate in sensitivity, sort of the reference test," said Karnauchow.</p>
<p>After those tests are conducted, any sample that tests negative for a known virus is labelled "non-typeable," raising the likelihood it could be the swine flu virus. At that point, the suspect sample is forwarded to Toronto, where the main virology lab conducts another round of screening, this time specifically for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>While it's still unclear whether the swine flu virus will stabilize or develop into a global pandemic, Karnauchow said he and his staff are "well positioned" to cope with the extra caseload should the outbreak persist into the summer.</p>
<p>"Many of us, if not all, feel that it's a real privilege to be part of the solution," said Karnauchow.</p>
<p>"People here are really knocking themselves out to make sure everything is done right."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>When poverty becomes respectable; As unemployment begins to affect average people, they see the poor in a new light</b>
</div><div>Judith McCormack   </div>
<div>898 words</div><div>17 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>As painful as the current economic crisis may be, it does at least provide us with some valuable insights.</p>
<p>Now that the threat of poverty has suddenly landed on the doorsteps of so many ordinary, hard-working people, it forces us to see this particular problem in a new and clear-eyed way. In fact, many of the myths about poverty have gone up in smoke, much like Bernard Madoff's investments.</p>
<p>Try as we might to cling to the outdated idea that poor people are lazy or dependent, we're now face to face with the evidence that layoffs, economic restructuring and market forces can quickly push any of us into dire straits.</p>
<p>We've lost our ability to pretend that poor people are "them." Alas, it turns out they could be us, or our neighbours, friends and relatives.</p>
<p>This uncomfortable revelation has the effect of highlighting the ways in which we normally stigmatize the poor, and the punitive nature of our social policies toward them.</p>
<p>Much as the Great Depression of the 1930s led to a shift of public opinion on poverty, a defining moment is upon us again. Then, as now, the macroeconomic causes of unemployment and homelessness were suddenly visible, undermining the idea that poverty was caused by individual failure or character defects.</p>
<p>The soaring unemployment of the Dirty '30s and the tens of thousands of people on government relief produced a significant change in public consciousness.</p>
<p>It became apparent that the economy was too unpredictable and contingent to make the ability to find a job either a prerequisite for the necessities of life or the primary criterion for social worth.</p>
<p>Poor people, previously considered moral outcasts, began to emerge as fellow human beings who had simply lost the economic lottery.</p>
<p>And attention shifted to social programs to ameliorate the harsh impact of market forces.</p>
<p>This was the climate in which many of our modern social programs had their genesis, including unemployment insurance and family allowances.</p>
<p>Fast forward to 2009.</p>
<p>We now know even more about the complex structural causes of poverty - not only the economic dislocations that eliminate jobs, but other factors such as low minimum wages, systemic discrimination, and the lack of affordable housing.</p>
<p>We know even more about the effects of poverty, the social exclusion that accompanies it and the price tag attached - not just in terms of individual misery, but through the increased costs it creates in the health-care, education and justice systems as well.</p>
<p>And we know even more about the unequal impact of poverty, where the poor include disproportionate numbers of people of colour, the elderly, people with disabilities and single parent families.</p>
<p>But the current economic crisis is a startling reminder that few of us are invulnerable.</p>
<p>With this realization also comes an opportunity for some public soul-searching, as well as a chance to redefine the role of our social programs. The soul-searching has to do with the lingering effects of notions of moral censure and charity that still dominate some of the public debate on poverty.</p>
<p>This has contributed to a situation where homelessness is more of an epidemic than swine flu, and where more than 700,000 people in Canada are forced to use food banks each month - half of them families with children.</p>
<p>At the same time, our social programs have all too often been miscast as frills, boondoggles or handouts to the undeserving.</p>
<p>Now that more and more of us are forced to turn to employment insurance and welfare, those myths are also in some disarray - much like the shrinking programs themselves.</p>
<p>This is a hard way to learn a lesson, but it does at least clear the way for a more sophisticated understanding of the role of social programs, one in which they are closer to the core of what it means to be a society.</p>
<p>Rather than being simply ameliorative, these programs embody a form of social citizenship in which all individuals are entitled to food, clothing, education, health care and full participation in society - not as a matter of altruism or compassion, but because these are rights that flow from the inherent dignity of personhood.</p>
<p>Much the same reasoning applies to the outdated notion that these programs are somehow peripheral to the mainstream.</p>
<p>In fact, they form an essential part of the backbone of a society, something central to the very idea of society itself.</p>
<p>In this sense, intelligent social investment is a fundamental aspect of the social glue that holds us together, a reflection of the essential interconnectedness of people occupying the same turf.</p>
<p>As a result, allowing social programs to deteriorate has implications not just for the individuals who are deprived of them, but for the structural integrity of society as a whole.</p>
<p>Going forward then, this perspective has the potential to inform the development of social policies in a way that is more coherent, knowledgeable and comprehensive.</p>
<p>And there is no better time to develop more enlightened social policies than now - when we think they might apply to us.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico offers 'flu-free deal'</b>

<p>Desperate to woo back travellers who cancelled trips in the wake of Mexico's swine flu outbreak, more than 20 coastal resort hotels have launched a "flu-free guarantee:" Guests who catch the H1N1 virus in Mexico -- and have the blood test to prove it -- can get their next three vacations for free.</p>
<p>The initiative comes as the country's tourism industry tallies staggering losses from a flu epidemic that Mexican officials first confirmed on April 23.</p>
<p>The country's official death toll rose to 64 last Thursday, with 2,656 confirmed infections. The virus has so far infected nearly 6,500 people worldwide.</p>
<p>After the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. State Department warned travelers against non-essential trips to Mexico, U.S. cruise lines dropped port calls, airlines waived cancellation fees and resorts emptied.</p>
<p>The advisory remains in effect despite lobbying efforts from Mexican hoteliers and the Florida-Caribbean Cruise Association, whose May 5 letter to Pres. Obama noted that "it is now apparent that the health implications of H1N1 are not limited to Mexico, (and) CDC and WHO officials have publicly stated the H1N1 virus is generally no greater health risk than seasonal influenza."</p>
<p>Tourism minister Rodolfo Elizondo estimated this week that a flu-related drop in foreign visitors could cost Mexico up to 250,000 jobs and as much as $4 billion. this year, or nearly a third of what the country earned from 22.6 million visitors last year.</p>
<p>The new flu guarantee is offered at Real Resorts, AMResorts, and Karisma's El Dorado and Azul hotels, most in Cancun or the Riviera Maya.</p>
<p>At least 25 Cancun hotels have closed because of low occupancy, and many are slashing rates.</p>
<p>To qualify for a free vacation under the flu guarantee, travellers must have made a new reservation at a participating hotel between May 8 and June 30 for travel taking place between May 8 and Dec. 20, 2009.</p>
<p>Sniffles don't count: Guests must provide a doctor's certification and positive test results, taken within five days of departure, for Influenza A -- H1N1. The three return stays -- one per year -- are valid for the original traveller plus one companion; blackout dates and other restrictions apply.</p>

<p>We've just returned from Puerto Vallarta in Mexico and, as far as we know, there hasn't been a single case of swine flu in the state of Jalisco where Puerto Vallarta is located.</p>
<p>There hasn't been enough coverage of the incredible blow the fear of swine flu has dealt to the economy of Mexico.</p>
<p>We stayed in a complex that included four large hotels. As of May 3, three were completely shut down. The streets along Puerto Vallarta's waterfront are almost empty and everywhere people are being laid off.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope for the sake of the wonderful people in Mexico that the world won't shun their country for too much longer. Last week the World Health Organization stated very clearly that restricting air travel in the case of an outbreak doesn't help at all. It's like shutting one window in a whole mansion of windows.</p>

<p>Four new cases of swine flu -- two in the Lower Mainland, one in northern B.C. and one on Vancouver Island -- have raised the total number of B.C. positive tests for H1N1 flu virus to 100.</p>
<p>The BC Centre for Disease Control is tracking all B.C. swine flu cases, and breaks them down according to the health regions where they are located.</p>
<p>To date, of the 100 confirmed cases, 38 cases are in Fraser Health, 27 are in Vancouver Coastal Health, 20 are in Northern Health, 13 are on Vancouver Island and two are in Interior Health.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has labelled the swine-flu pandemic a Phase 5, meaning it has passed from human to human in at least two countries. An advisory for non-essential travel has advised Canadians not to visit Mexico.</p>
<p>Persons exhibiting flu-like symptoms or who have questions are asked to visit healthlinkbc.ca or dial 811.</p>
<p>The Centre for Disease Control has issued a few common-sense rules to avoid spreading the virus, including: n Stay home from work or school if you are sick, regardless of where you have travelled, unless directed to seek medical care. Limit contact with others.</p>
<p>- See a health-care provider if your symptoms become worse, but call ahead to tell them your symptoms.</p>
<p>- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when you sneeze. Throw the tissue in the trash afterward. When you cough, do so into your sleeve.</p>
<p>- Wash your hands often.</p>
<p>Early detection is key to limited the effects of swine flu. Patients who contract swine flu are generally treated with Tamiflu, an antiviral drug used for the treatment and prevention of Influenza A and B.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency say they have mapped the full genetic sequence of the swine flu.</p>
<p>They say their research confirms that the swine flu in pigs is identical to the influenza being found in humans.</p>
<p>"Studies are also under way to assess the effectiveness of current vaccines, and to develop better and faster diagnostic methods," reads a CFIA statement. iaustin@theprovince.com</p>

<p><span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>. said yesterday the H1N1 flu virus has created sharply higher demand for its antimicrobial surgical masks and respirators and it plans to deliver 7.5 million units to North American, European and Mid-East customers over the next quarter. Its target annual production is 20 million. The company reported third-quarter revenue was $3.93 million, up 10.5 per cent from a year earlier, but below forecast, and net loss was $5.7 million, up from $3.8 million. Nine months' revenue was $13.8 million, up from $10.2 million a year earlier, and net loss $19.1 million against $9 million. Expenses rose sharply because of higher marketing costs and acquisitions in Canada, Algeria and Taiwan. Market development efforts in China are being intensified.</p>

<p>STAKEHOLDER WILL VOTE AGAINST PETROCAN-SUNCOR TAKEOVER</p>
<p>Letko Brosseau and Associates Inc., a Montreal-based investment company with a stake in <span class="companylink">Petro-Canada</span>, said it will vote against a $19.3-billion takeover bid from <span class="companylink">Suncor Energy Inc</span>. for the refiner.</p>
<p>The all-stock deal, which will give Suncor 62 per cent of the combined company, undervalues <span class="companylink">Petro-Canada</span>, Letko Brosseau said in a statement. <span class="companylink">Petro-Canada</span> is worth at least as much as Suncor, it said.</p>
<p>Letko Brosseau is <span class="companylink">Petro-Canada</span>'s sixth-largest shareholder with control of 10.4 million shares, or 2.16 per cent of its stock, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The investment company says <span class="companylink">Petro-Canada</span> generates more cash and produces more oil than Suncor.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Petro-Canada</span>, the country's second-largest oil refiner, generated $6.4 billion in cash flow in 2008 and pumped 418,000 barrels a day of oil equivalent in 2008, compared with $4.5 billion and 264,700 barrels for Suncor, Letko Brosseau said.</p>
<p>Both Calgary-based oil companies posted losses in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The sale of <span class="companylink">Petro-Canada</span> to Suncor, an oilsands company, will create Canada's largest energy producer, yielding cost savings and sufficient scale to shoulder high-cost projects amid lower prices, the companies said March 23. Holders of both companies will vote on the transaction June 5. A two-thirds approval is required to complete the sale.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>COLD-FX SALES, PROFITS DROP</p>
<p>Edmonton - <span class="companylink">Afexa Life Sciences</span> (TSX: FXA) said lower sales of Cold-FX resulted in a second-quarter loss.</p>
<p>The $3.2-million loss for the period ended March 31, worth three cents a share, came on $6.1 million revenue, compared with a $768,000 loss, a cent a share, on $10.7 million revenue last year.</p>
<p>Afexa's sales to retailers were down as they adopted economy-driven just-in-time purchasing to significantly reduce inventory from many suppliers, the company said.</p>
<p>Consumer purchases of Cold-FX from retailers fell modestly as incidences of colds and flu declined.</p>
<p>However, the recent H1N1 flu outbreak has increased demand for Cold-FX, and the company said it remains on track for a profitable year and strong fourth quarter.</p>
<p>TOTAL BANKS ON CANADA</p>
<p>PARIS - <span class="companylink">Total SA</span>, Europe's third-largest oil company, said heavy oil from Canada and Venezuela will make up about 10 per cent of its output and 15 per cent of reserves within 15 years. Pumping heavy oil "is complicated" and requires "patience," chief executive Christophe de Margerie told shareholders in Paris on Friday.</p>
<p>"We consider it long-term," he said. Total's failure to gain control of Canadian company <span class="companylink">UTS Energy Corp</span>., "doesn't change our desire to invest in the oilsands," de Margerie said.</p>
<p>AECL TOUTED FOR NEW PLANT</p>
<p>MONTREAL - Crown-owned <span class="companylink">Atomic Energy of Canada</span> is reported to be the leading bidder for construction of the first Ontario nuclear power station to be built since the 1980s, a multibillion-dollar project near Toronto.</p>
<p>Its competitor is Areva of France, through its Canadian subsidiary, while Westinghouse Electric would supply technology, but not overall construction. Areva is the world's biggest nuclear station builder.</p>
<p>AECL is the guardian of Canada's CANDU technology used in Ontario's existing nuclear power network.</p>
<p>TIMMINCO MUM ON LAWSUIT</p>
<p>TORONTO - Timminco CEO Heinz Schimmelbusch kept quiet after leaving his annual meeting on Thursday when asked about a legal action launched against the company.</p>
<p>"No comment is the appropriate comment," he said. In a Thursday statement, the company said it was aware of the suit but had not yet been served with documents.</p>
<p>Timminco was slapped with a $520-million lawsuit on Thursday that stated the company made "false and misleading statements" about its potential to produce high-purity silicon for the solar industry.</p>
<p>MOLSON COORS DIVIDEND UP</p>
<p>MONTREAL - <span class="companylink">Molson Coors Brewing Co</span>. said on Friday it is raising its quarterly dividend rate by 20 per cent, citing better operating results and strong free cash flow.</p>
<p>The quarterly payout on the Canadian-listed shares rises to 28 cents a share, and on the U.S. listed stock to 24 cents US.</p>
<p>Molson Coors, resulting from the 2005 merger of Canada's <span class="companylink">Molson Breweries</span> with the U.S. Coors, said it has added financial muscle by building its brands, reducing costs and paying down debt.</p>
<p>QUEBECOR PLAN FACES VOTE</p>
<p>NEW YORK - <span class="companylink">Quebecor World Inc</span>., the bankrupt printer of magazines such as Time and Cosmopolitan, won approval to send its plan to reorganize out to creditors for a vote.</p>
<p>U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck said the Montreal-based company could mail the so-called disclosure statement out with ballots once attorneys had worked out adjustment of some payment terms.</p>
<p>The company and creditors committee added information to the documents about an unsolicited May 12 takeover offer from <span class="companylink">R.R. Donnelley & Sons Co</span>. for $1.35 billion US in cash and stock. The company and creditors are still assessing the offer.</p>
<p>SASKATOON FOUNDRY CLOSING</p>
<p>SASKATOON - Nearly 40 people will be out of work when a Saskatoon foundry closes its doors at the end of the month.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">ESCO Corp</span>.'s Saskatoon plant, which manufactures industrial castings for the mining industry, was selected for closing in late April, said Nick Blauwiekel, the company's vice-president of human resources.</p>
<p>He said the company's other foundries in Nisku, and Port Hope, Ont., are able to take on the Saskatoon plant's work.</p>
<p>POLE-DANCING CHAIN BANKRUPT</p>
<p>NEW YORK - <span class="companylink">Crunch Fitness</span>, the health-club chain with cardio-striptease and pole-dancing classes, may have marked the end of an era when it filed for bankruptcy last week after about a 25-per-cent membership decline.</p>
<p>The New York-based company founded 20 years ago in an East Village aerobics studio cited slowing membership and overpriced leases for its troubles.</p>
<p>"The fad that Crunch focused on is not quite there anymore," said Toon van Beeck, senior analyst at marketing researcher IBISWorld Inc.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">UBS</span> BOOSTING BONUSES</p>
<p>PARIS - UBS AG, the European bank with the biggest losses from the financial crisis, plans to boost salaries for senior bankers by an average of 50 per cent to stem defections, three people with knowledge of the matter said.</p>
<p>The salary increase would apply to managing directors in investment-banking, fixed-income and equities worldwide, said insiders. Less-senior bankers -- associate directors and executive directors -- may also get raises.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">UBS</span> amassed the biggest loss in Swiss corporate history in 2008.</p>
<p>PANASONIC LOSS WIDENS</p>
<p>TOKYO - Japanese electronics maker <span class="companylink">Panasonic Corp</span>. forecast a bigger-than-expected annual loss after booking a record quarter of red ink, battered by weak demand, price falls and hefty restructuring costs.</p>
<p>The company, which vies with <span class="companylink">Sony Corp</span>. for the title of the world's largest consumer electronics maker, has seen earnings deteriorate as the global economic crisis prompts consumers to cut spending on flat TVs and digital cameras.</p>
<p>Panasonic said its net loss for the January-March quarter totalled 444.3 billion yen ($5.5 billion Cdn), down from a 61.6-billion-yen profit a year earlier.</p>
<p>INSURERS CLEARED FOR BAILOUT</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - <span class="companylink">Prudential Financial Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Hartford Financial Services Group Inc</span>. are among six insurers granted access to U.S. aid as the government moves to shore up an industry battered by investment losses.</p>
<p>Hartford won preliminary approval for $3.4 billion US in capital from the Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program, the Connecticut-based insurer said in a statement. Prudential, <span class="companylink">Allstate Corp</span>., <span class="companylink">Principal Financial Group Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Ameriprise Financial Inc</span>. also are eligible for funds, said Andrew Williams, a spokesman for the Treasury. <span class="companylink">Lincoln National Corp</span>. said it may receive $2.5 billion US.</p>

</p>
<p>Two Edmontonians vacationing in China were quarantined this week while Chinese authorities searched for travellers who might have been in contact with a 19-year-old student who had recently returned from Canada.</p>
<p>The student tested positive for the H1N1 virus Wednesday and was being treated in isolation in the eastern city of Jinan, the official Xinhua news agency said. He was the country's second confirmed case of the influenza virus in a week.</p>
<p>The Edmontonians, who asked not to be identified, said they were placed in quarantine Tuesday because they were on the same Air Canada flight to Beijing as the student, and sat within six rows of him.</p>
<p>"Myself and my travelling companion were apprehended by Chinese authorities yesterday at our hotel in central Beijing," one Edmonton resident said in an e-mail. "We were part of a tour group, organized through a Canadian tour company, that is travelling across China throughout May.</p>
<p>"Neither of us have any flu symptoms, and other than the stress we are experiencing, we feel fine. As it stands, we have no idea when we might be let out. The Chinese medical people and hotel staff have been pleasant enough, but again, the language barrier is a huge problem. We have been subject to basic medical examinations, throat swabs, etc., by doctors who do not speak any English and who cannot explain what is going on. I completely sympathize with the Chinese government's attempts to control the spread of H1N1, and they have treated us well enough, but I am very frustrated by the lack of information we are receiving."</p>
<p>The Edmontonians were being quarantined with about 100 other travellers thought to have come into contact with the student, who apparently spent three days untracked in Beijing before leaving Monday by train for Jinan.</p>
<p>By the time the student boarded the train he had developed a fever, headache and sore throat, the Chinese news agency said.</p>
<p>The hotel where the student stayed in Beijing was sealed off and staff wearing masks could be seen putting bundles of bed sheets in a van. Security officers wearing latex gloves and masks were stationed around the hotel, the news agency reported.</p>
<p>Alberta Health and Wellness said Friday no new H1N1 cases had been reported in the province, leaving the total confirmed number at 67. All but five of the cases had mild symptoms.</p>
<p>Five people have been hospitalized with the flu. One of them, a 39-year-old woman from the Gift Lake Métis Settlement, died in hospital after contracting the flu. The woman also had asthma and diabetes, and an autopsy was unable to determine whether the flu virus played a role in her death.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The cutting edge; The Festival TransAmériques is an 18-day marathon of theatre and dance that will alter your perceptions of what these art forms are all about</b>
</div><div>PAT DONNELLY   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>860 words</div><div>16 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>E1 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>It's a mad, provocative mix: Chilean political drama, Italian tragi-comedy, Hungarian peasant opera, a German anatomy lesson (choreographed by Sasha Waltz), line-dancing on Emery St., and a new Robert Lepage work created in collaboration with French dance vedette Sylvie Guillem and British choreographer Russell Maliphant fresh from its London debut.</p>
<p>These are but a few of the tantalizing offerings in store during the third edition of Festival TransAmériques (FTA), which kicks off Wednesday for an 18-day performing arts marathon of 24 shows, presented by 22 companies from 12 countries at 13 Montreal venues.</p>
<p>Since the rebirth of the festival formerly known as Festival de Théâtre des Amériques (also FTA), in 2007, artistic director Marie-Hélène Falcon hasn't had a lot of down time.</p>
<p>An event that was once biennial now happens every year. What was once a singular focus on experimental theatre has given way to a bifocal perspective that encompasses dance and theatre in relatively equal portions, both with generous multi-media components.</p>
<p>When Falcon spoke to the Gazette this week, she was in Brussels, where she was attending the Kunsten Arts Festival. Shopping the world for cutting edge shows is a task that never ends. "I'm looking all the time," she said. "For next year, for the year after."</p>
<p>She has, however, booked herself a bit of jet-lag-recovery time before this year's FTA opens on Wednesday.</p>
<p>It begins with an outdoor, noon-hour dance show involving a steam shovel at the Old Port and an evening theatre production from Riga, Latvia, that pays tribute to the music of Simon and Garfunkel, at Usine C.</p>
<p>In addition to attending the shows, Falcon will be holding court at the Agora <span class="companylink">Hydro-Québec</span> of UQAM after the shows are over on opening night, and on most other nights during the festival. "It's non-stop, " she said. "It's a hectic period."</p>
<p>She's always busy introducing presenters, festival organizers (and journalists) from around the world</p>
<p>to agents, directors and choreographers who have brought their shows to FTA in the hopes of widening their grazing range.</p>
<p>It's this trade-fair aspect of the FTA that Falcon is a bit worried about this year. Ticket sales are going well, with many performances already sold out. A few tickets remain for the Lepage show, she said, and for the Hungarian L'Opéra Paysan. The Brazilian hip-hop dance show, H3, is sold out.</p>
<p>And Bioboxes from Vancouver, which only accommodates a handful of people for each performance, is completely full, too. Typically, tickets to the best FTA shows become scarce almost as soon as the festival begins.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm of the Montreal public for this festival has never been in question. But recent federal government budget cuts have reduced Falcon's financial ability to entice foreign buyers to attend, "by about two-thirds," she said, adding, "Some will come anyway. Some won't come at all."</p>
<p>Worse yet, because of the disappearance of the Trade Routes and PromArt funding for travel, Canadian companies will stand at a marketing disadvantage in their own festival. Almost all countries that Falcon deals with subsidize the travel expenses of their artists.</p>
<p>So if two shows are seen to be of equal appeal, the Canadian one could lose out.</p>
<p>Looking on the brighter side, Falcon does admit that the Quebec government and the Conseil des arts de Montréal have provided some compensation for the loss of federal funding.</p>
<p>In general, preparations for FTA 2009 are moving along smoothly, Falcon said.</p>
<p>In years past, the FTA has had some trouble getting artists across borders. But that's history. Since there are no Mexican productions on the list, the swine flu issue hasn't come up - yet. "Some (artists) are coming from Chile," she said, "but they're arriving from Vienna."</p>
<p>As usual, there's a strong educational component to the festival, with lunchtime encounters with directors and choreographers, and afternoon round table discussions on such topics as Bringing War to the Stage and New Theatre in Chile.</p>
<p>Who goes to the festival? Falcon, who has been the guiding light of the FTA since 1985, is hoping to find out this year. The festival will be doing its first-ever audience survey, she said.</p>
<p>"The (demographic) profile is changing. It's getting younger. And with the addition of dance, it's changing, too."</p>
<p>This year's programming will be notable for its diversity, she said. "That's the beauty of it."</p>

</p>
<p>"What's in a name?" asks Shakespeare's Juliet, trying to deal with the news that her beloved Romeo is a Montague, her family's bitter enemy. "That which we call a rose by any other name would smell as sweet."</p>
<p>Juliet decides that names don't really matter, for the quality of a person or object is unaffected by a mere word.</p>
<p>Try telling that to those pig farmers,</p>
<p>Orthodox Jews and Muslims, butchers and Mexicans who feel angered by a name.</p>
<p>I'm referring, of course, to the current outbreak of a new influenza strain. It has caused verbal chaos, as governments, physicians and the media struggle to decide what the sickness should be called. Whatever name we finally settle on, our choice has implications.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has an official name for the disease: "influenza A (H1N1) virus, human." Health Canada's website uses the phrase "H1N1 Flu Virus (Human Swine Flu)." But does anyone outside labs and government offices talk like that?</p>
<p>Initially, almost all English-speakers called the illness "swine flu." It was after loud protests from the pork industry and some religious groups that alternatives began to appear. The need for such alternatives appeared more urgent when Egypt (a country untouched by the illness) announced plans to slaughter its 300,000 pigs. For now the possibilities include:</p>
<p>"H1N1 flu" or "H1N1 virus," shorter versions of the technical name. In an article published on May 3, the Globe and Mail used the phrase "H1N1 virus" in the first paragraph, and on second reference called it "the virus formerly known as swine flu."</p>
<p>"Mexican flu," after the apparent country of origin. Prime Minister Stephen Harper used this term repeatedly on April 30, but then beat a silent retreat. As of May 10, this was still the phrase preferred in the Netherlands. Unfortunately, it has been hijacked by anti-immigration activists in the United States, who enjoy denouncing "killer Mexican flu."</p>
<p>"North American flu," after the three countries with the largest number of cases to date. The World Organization for Animal Health favours this phrase. It has the obvious effect of shifting attention north of the Rio Grande.</p>
<p>"Hybrid flu," alluding to the apparent mixture of swine, human and bird pathogens in the new virus. The English-language edition of Pravda is among the few groups to adopt this term.</p>
<p>"SI," short for swine influenza; this is said to be the favourite in South Korea.</p>
<p>"New flu," as it's known in Taiwan. But any expression including "new" tends to date fast.</p>
<p>A similar problem exists in French. Until the end of April, Le Devoir opted for "la grippe porcine;" now it refers to "grippe A (H1N1)" on first reference and "grippe A" thereafter. La Presse also goes with "grippe A (H1N1)" at the beginning of an article; then it moves to "grippe H1N1."</p>
<p>The Gazette, along with many other news outlets in the United States, Britain and English Canada, has stuck with "swine flu," and I'm sure that's how most people think of the illness. If the term suggests that pigs are unsafe to eat, it may not be entirely fair. But fairness has never been a property of naming - wherever the 1918 pandemic of Spanish flu began (Kansas is a prime candidate), it was certainly not Spain.</p>
<p>I'm pleased that most English-language media have not emulated their francophone colleagues by making "H1N1 virus" the preferred name. "H1N1" requires four syllables to pronounce, and its mixture of numbers and letters is unnatural to most speakers. A phrase other than "swine flu" may yet sweep the day. But if it does, I hope it uses standard words rather than technical identifiers. A memorable disease deserves a memorable name, easy to recognize and easy to say.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Now for some happier news. In March, the Local Government Association in Britain compiled a list of 200 words and phrases it wants members to avoid.</p>
<p>"The public sector must not hide behind impenetrable jargon," said Margaret Eaton, who chairs the association. She provided a fine specimen: "Why do we have to have 'coterminous stakeholder engagement' when we could just 'talk to people' instead?"</p>
<p>Some of the offending expressions have not yet crossed the pond, and I hope they never will. (Two examples: "horizon scanning" and "gateway review.") But others regularly land with a dull thud on Canadian as well as British ears: "fast track," "paradigm," "meaningful consultation," "proportionality" ...</p>
<p>I'm happy to see my pet peeve for 2009 on the list of terms to be avoided: "going forward." Is it possible for any politician or business leader - or, indeed, any sports commentator - to string a few sentences together without talking about "going forward?" A cliché by any other name would smell as sour.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu scare in Mexico points out the risk in making travel plans; Travel insurance can cover some of the potential problems, but not all of them</b>
</div><div>Catharine Hamm   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>541 words</div><div>16 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>H4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Question: I am going to Mexico in August with my family and am worried about the flu. I called Continental and tried to cancel my reservation, but I cannot get my money back. Continental says it's too far in the future. But I have a time share that I need to cancel now or lose my fee. I am very frightened; I have three children and a boyfriend with medical problems, so we would appreciate some advice. Whom can I call?</p>
<p>--Cindy Ecay</p>
<p>Valley Cottage, N.Y.</p>
<p>Answer: Ecay is caught in an unfortunate and seemingly ectoplasmic event because of three tenets of travel:</p>
<p>No. 1: Travel providers don't refund money -- at least, not very often. The last refund I got from an airline was for a flight I was supposed to take five days after 9/11.</p>
<p>No. 2: Travel providers rarely consider fear as a reason to cancel. If there's a hurricane, they think we should sail anyway. They don't run their businesses on "might" and "maybe."</p>
<p>No. 3: Travel providers are dispositional optimists; that is, they think the sun will come out tomorrow, Annie.</p>
<p>And they might be right. But they might not. And that's why there's travel insurance.</p>
<p>That's the good news: You can safeguard your financial investment in a vacation by buying travel insurance that covers some (but not all) situations. The bad news? For flu coverage, you had to have bought it before April 24, generally, and even if there is a pandemic, you may not be covered if you decide to stay home. If you have cancel-for-any-reason insurance, which is usually an optional add-on, you may be covered, but, says Chris Harvey, chief executive of Square-mouth.com, a travel insurance comparison site, you won't get back all of your money (sometimes as little as 35 per cent), and it is expensive, sometimes adding 40 per cent to the cost of your policy. Harvey's not a big fan of this kind of policy.</p>
<p>So Ecay's best bet now is to sit tight. "What I recommend people do is stay in contact with their airline," said Terry Trippler, an airline expert whose Web sites are www.terrytrippler.com[http://www.terrytrippler.com] (subscription) and www.tripplersview.com[http://www.tripplersview.com] (free). "Your airline is the one who will know; your airline is the one who can make any special allowances. So, again I advise, regardless of where you purchased your ticket, deal directly with your airline."</p>
<p>Anne Banas, executive editor of SmarterTravel.com, thinks the window for change fee waivers may widen if the outbreak of H1N1, or swine flu, worsens. To see airlines' policies, check www.smartertravel.com[http://www.smartertravel.com] or www.airfarewatchdog.com[http://www.airfarewatchdog.com]. Ecay may get to make her trip to Mexico, but who knows for sure? The best we can say at this point is that the sun may not come out tomorrow, but it certainly will rise in the east.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Celebrities give unwarranted boost to science-averse anti-vaccine groups</b>
</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>651 words</div><div>16 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>

<p>Among the many measures that could contain the latest influenza outbreak, and hence prevent the development of a pandemic, none is more important than finding a vaccine.</p>
<p>Indeed, vaccination is one of the most important public health measures ever developed, as vaccines have saved countless people from disease and death, and have all but eradicated a number of deadly diseases.</p>
<p>Consequently, scientists are working around the clock to develop a vaccine for the A, H1N1 virus. Yet while they do so, another group of people are working just as hard at promoting skepticism of vaccines.</p>
<p>This group, composed of celebrities, lawyers and many parents of sick children, suggests that, far from preventing disease transmission, vaccines actually cause a variety of medical and psychological ills.</p>
<p>Such sentiments are far from new, since "anti-vaccinationists" have been around for as long as vaccines. But with the Internet's unparalleled ability to spread rumours, innuendo and conspiracy theories, and with celebrities taking a leading role in the anti-vaccionationist movement, stories about the damage allegedly caused by vaccines are receiving more publicity than ever.</p>
<p>Former Playboy model Jenny McCarthy is now the highest-profile spokesperson for the thoroughly discredited vaccine-autism theory, with recent appearances on Larry King Live and the Oprah Winfrey Show.</p>
<p>McCarthy, who claims her son was autistic (though the diagnosis is disputed), has now received a book deal from Oprah, which guarantees that the vaccine-autism theory will live on in the minds of many.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, since there is simply no scientific evidence to substantiate it. The theory began with the publication of a 1998 study in the medical journal The Lancet. Gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues suggested that the measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine could cause bowel problems in children, and that that could ultimately lead to autism.</p>
<p>Since publication of that study, Wakefield has come under fire for failing to reveal conflicts of interest -- his work was funded by parents of autistic children who were seeking damages in court -- and the Sunday Times newspaper reported earlier this year that Wakefield had manipulated the results in his paper.</p>
<p>The Lancet and Wakefield's colleagues have now distanced themselves from the study, but the vaccine-autism theory continues to occupy the popular imagination.</p>
<p>Some people have theorized that the mercury-containing preservative thimerosal, formerly present in the MMR vaccine, could cause autism, while others have suggested that immunizing children for three different diseases at once could overload their immune systems.</p>
<p>These hypotheses have been repeatedly tested, and there is no evidence to support them. Consequently, every major medical and scientific group, including the World Health Organization, the U.S. National Academy of Sciences and its Institute of Medicine, and the Cochrane Collaboration (which performs reviews of academic literature) have affirmed that there is no evidence of any link between the MMR vaccine and autism.</p>
<p>Despite this, the vaccine-autism theory still has its believers, which suggests that proponents of the theory aren't interested in what the science says. Similarly, they're not interested in what courts say, as a recent finding by an American "vaccine court" that the MMR vaccine didn't cause autism in the children of the plaintiffs failed to change the believers' minds.</p>
<p>This is unfortunate, since, in contrast to the lack of evidence for the vaccine-autism theory, there is abundant evidence that the failure to vaccinate can and has led to serious outbreaks of disease.</p>
<p>And while nothing, including vaccines, is completely risk free, vaccines rarely cause complications beyond some irritation at the injection site or a brief fever.</p>
<p>Consequently, while Jenny McCarthy and other celebrities might have popular appeal, if we really want to know the truth about vaccines, and if we're really committed to protecting public health, it's better to look at the science.</p>

</div><div>Don Braid   </div>

</p>
<p>Deputy premier Ron Stevens is gone. Here comes the judge.</p>
<p>In one of the oddest political resignations on record, the Calgary-Glenmore MLA slipped out of politics Friday without a word.</p>
<p>The reason for that, sources say (and have said for months), is that Stevens is about to be appointed to Court of Queen's bench, or even higher.</p>
<p>That news is expected next week. Meanwhile, Silent Stevens is doing the smart thing by putting as much distance as possible between his political and judicial lives.</p>
<p>Stevens told Premier Ed Stelmach about his plans Thursday night. Although it was no surprise to Ed, he'll spend the weekend figuring out what to do next.</p>
<p>The resignation could prompt a major cabinet shuffle. Ministers are already preening and buffing in expectation.</p>
<p>Stevens' job, international and intergovernmental relations, is a big plum for politicians who like flyer points. If somebody promising jumps into it (Environment Minister Rob Renner, for instance, or Advanced Education Minister Doug Horner) the dominos will tumble right through cabinet.</p>
<p>There's been a lot of talk about Health Minister Ron Liepert switching to another senior job. His blunt reforming style, effective enough in a boom, is a tad short on caring in hard times.</p>
<p>Despite that, my guess is that Liepert will stay put. And so might Energy Minister Mel Knight, who still faces royalty-review hostility from the oilpatch. Stelmach is very loyal to the troops.</p>
<p>The big battle could be over Stevens' role as deputy premier. It conveys huge status while allowing the lucky winner to hold another big job with full departmental power.</p>
<p>Top guns like Finance Minister Iris Evans, or Treasury Board president Lloyd Snelgrove, could well imagine themselves in the deputy's chair. They might even expect it. And they were Ed's loyalists from the start.</p>
<p>But the premier must also be asking whether he now needs a deputy premier at all. The answer is, he doesn't.</p>
<p>Stevens took that role after Stelmach won the leadership, but before his party grabbed a huge majority on March 3, 2008.</p>
<p>It was a dangerous interlude, especially in Calgary. Stelmach was surrounded by caucus critics still bitter about Jim Dinning's loss.</p>
<p>The northern inner circle --Evans, Snelgrove, Ray Danyluk --were almost paranoid about the southern menace.</p>
<p>Stevens, though, was never a critic. Although he'd been a big Dinning backer, he instantly shifted his loyalty to Stelmach.</p>
<p>And yet he was increasingly ambivalent about politics. During this period I encountered Stevens by chance in Victoria, where he was vacationing with his wife. Enjoying the sun and the sea, he made it clear he didn't plan to run again.</p>
<p>Then Stelmach surprised Stevens with his offer; he would be deputy premier and political minister charged with winning Calgary.</p>
<p>Stevens played a major hand in the Calgary campaign. It worked out pretty well; the Tories won 18 of 23 seats.</p>
<p>Although his departure has been rumoured for months, Stevens kept plugging to the end, still one of the most effective ministers in cabinet.</p>
<p>Just last week he ripped into Tory MLAs for raising questions about new land use rules when they'd kept silent earlier. He piloted public swine flu strategy while Stelmach was away last week.</p>
<p>Oddly for a politician (but not for a judge) Stevens didn't enjoy the public spotlight. Even during the Calgary political crisis, he wasn't as public as Stelmach might have liked.</p>
<p>But he was an ideal second fiddle, being both highly skilled and devoid of ambition to replace the conductor.</p>
<p>Stelmach will have trouble finding another one of those; and now he doesn't need to.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1 flu</p>
<p>I am interested every day being able to hear about the H1N1 flu. But is it not just as important to hear about other health crises as well?</p>
<p>Are they not all equally important?</p>
<p>If issues like heart disease and obesity were mentioned every day, we would probably be doing more to find a solution.</p>
<p>I think our health care is great but there can always be improvement.</p>

</p>
<p>CARTERSVILLE, Ga. -- The three wise men who have gathered here today wish to make one thing perfectly clear: They don't want this to be Earth's final hour.</p>
<p>They are mere messengers whom God, in His infinite wisdom, has granted the ability to unlock the secrets of Biblical prophecy.</p>
<p>And their message today is the ultimate of warnings - people get ready, time is up.</p>
<p>The Great Recession, Islamic terror, Barack Obama and all that he stands for, the Taliban gunning for Pakistan's nukes, the Middle East mess, auto bankruptcies, buckling banks, shifting American morality from gay marriage to abortion to stem-cell research. To say nothing of swine flu. Add up all the grim factoids, collate them against the 1,136 prophecies the Holy Book foretells, and, well, hang on to your hats.</p>
<p>All signs point to the end being not just nigh, but any minute now.</p>
<p>Big church. Small town. Bible Belt. An absolute peach of a cloudless spring Saturday in northern Georgia. The kind of day that makes you glad to be alive.</p>
<p>And here we are, some 500 souls in Tabernacle Baptist Church, learning to connect the dots between today's surfeit of global trauma and ancient scripture. Eight hours of ominous apocalyptic equations for Bible-believing Baptists.</p>
<p>This reporter arrived incognito at the conference entitled Global Warning: Is This Earth's Final Hour? And I came away clinging to faith that, however messy things may be, this world will stumble on.</p>
<p>Still, there is no understanding Obama's America without also taking the pulse of the other side. And while the gathering here today is but one especially furious pulse among many that pound against the country's new direction, it is a beat worth taking.</p>
<p>One can appreciate evangelicals' disenchantment with the here and now. Less than a year ago, Christian right organizations at the forefront of America's culture wars had the ear of the George W. Bush White House. They were his votes, he was their president, prayer for prayer.</p>
<p>One election later, that clout is gone. Team Obama, in all its multiethnic, multi-denominational glory, has dislodged them from the front row of power, restoring the separation of church and state in ways that must have Moral Majority co-founder Jerry Falwell spinning in his grave.</p>
<p>It is far too soon to say how the Christian right will respond to its new-found alienation.</p>
<p>For now, there is anger, disarray, fragmentation, frustration and profound distrust of Team Obama's moral judgments, from the decision to open a new chapter in stem-cell research to the President's welcoming, on Inauguration Day, of atheists as a valid voice in the national conversation.</p>
<p>For this branch of hardcore believers, marginalization appears only to have deepened their faith in the imminence of the end.</p>
<p>The three "prophecy preachers" here today are widely published and well-travelled stalwarts of American social conservatism who now tour together regularly as a sort of Triumvirate of Tribulation.</p>
<p>There are Gary Frazier of Discovery Missions and Ed Hindson, dean of the Institute of Biblical Studies at Liberty University in Virginia - both here to whet the audience's end-times appetite.</p>
<p>But the uncontested star is controversial evangelist and author Tim LaHaye, whose Biblically inspired series of pulp thrillers, Left Behind, has sold more than 65 million copies, a feat of Christian publishing second only to the Bible itself.</p>
<p>From sunrise to sunset, these three men take turns pounding into us a kind of Christian Exit Strategy, which, reduced to its essence, goes like this: A rapid sequence of globe-shaking events is about to unfold, beginning with the Rapture - in which tens of millions of True Believers vanish in an instant, "caught away" to the heavens. The rest of us will roast.</p>
<p>"In that nanosecond, America dies," Frazier says in a lecture bordering on the seditious, titled "The Death of America and Birth of the New World Order."</p>
<p>And then, seven years of trial and tribulation "when God pours out His judgment." Fire and brimstone, plague and pestilence, the rise of the Antichrist, all building to a crescendo of ultimate world war - specifically, one that will see a Russian-Islamic military alliance attack Israel.</p>
<p>"You cannot imagine, nor can I, the horrors, the atrocities that will take place," says Frazier. "We think about the Holocaust, the killing fields of Cambodia ... yet they pale into insignificance in relation to what is going to happen."</p>
<p>Finally, Judgment Day itself. And here is the all-important silver lining in their interpretation of God's foretelling: Jesus will descend on Jerusalem with an army of True Believers, smite all who refuse him, and establish a new reality.</p>
<p>That new era is the real carrot dangled before us today: Everyone in the pews here in Cartersville can be part of that future ruling class - a Millennial Kingdom to last 1,000 years, with Christ and all good Christians reigning together on Earth.</p>
<p>At Lunch, this reporter skips the box meal on offer, feeling the need to flee. Cartersville has at least three claims to fame - it's home to the oldest outdoor Coca-Cola sign (1894), the hometown of actor Wayne Knight, a.k.a. Newman in Seinfeld, and birthplace of Methodist minister Samuel Porter Jones, who originated the aphorism, "The road to hell is paved with good intentions."</p>
<p>Churches abound. But among the string of shops in the old downtown is a funky clothing boutique called Psycho Sisters. Inside, I chat with Anna, a twentysomething sales clerk, and ask if she's aware the world is nearly kaput according to the folks in the church down the street.</p>
<p>"Really?" she says, laughing. "Well, I'm not surprised they would say that. This is a pretty religious place. Although there are a few of us psychos around."</p>
<p>Back at the church, we happen across the part of the show that is, well, self-fulfilling prophecy - tables chockablock with books, CDs and DVDs chronicling each preacher's take on today's warning. Some go for $20 a pop, but you can bundle three together for just $40.</p>
<p>As the afternoon session begins, the fundraising becomes more overt. Our hosts order the organist to play "some nice cheque-writing music." Today, they're hoping to raise $13,000, to cover the cost of hotels, travel and the multi-camera crew that is capturing this road show for posterity, however long that might be. Cheques flow in from every pew.</p>
<p>But the preachers here today seem genuine, God-fearing Evangelists. And they appear to be less interested in cash than souls - to bring as many of us across into the realm of the born-again while there is still time.</p>
<p>Though they insist this is not something they actually want, there is a tone of angry and at times bitter defiance in these lectures, some of it overtly political.</p>
<p>Hindson touches on it at one point, referring to "the poor girl who stood up in the Miss USA context and said gay marriage is wrong.</p>
<p>"Tragically, today in America you can get up and criticize Christianity to death and nobody cares. (But) you make any statement considered politically incorrect and the media goes absolutely insane.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry. It's Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve. 'How dare the Christians tell the truth!' We're the ones who are supposed to shut up and go away. But we're not ever gonna shut up, and we're not gonna go away."</p>
<p>The audience erupts with sustained applause.</p>
<p>That "poor girl" - Miss California Carrie Prejean, 21 - is mentioned for good reason. She happens to be a student of San Diego Christian College, a school founded in 1970 by LaHaye. There, as here, end-times prophecy is central to the curriculum.</p>
<p>And then comes LaHaye himself, a mesmerizing man. Exuding a boyish, folksy charm that belies his 83 years, the rail-thin preacher takes up the story of Miss California, beaming pride over the many parents who have inquired about his school.</p>
<p>"They tell me, 'If that is the kind of person you put out, I want my daughter to come next fall.'".</p>
<p>In short order, LaHaye shifts gears to the crux of his message. To those worried about their collapsed retirement savings, he says, "Don't worry about it - I don't think we're going to be spending our retirement. The upper-taker (Jesus) is going to catch us first. If He's coming, He better hurry and get here before the federal government.</p>
<p>"Every morning you can wake up and say, 'Lord, is this the day?' And don't worry about it, no matter how young or old you are - you are not going to miss a thing. Because what's ahead is much better than what we've got now - particularly after the last election... Personally, I've never been a lover of socialism."</p>
<p>LaHaye proceeds to the motherlode of Biblical prophecy, and he is welling with tears now as he describes the miracle of Israel's rebirth 61 years ago - and how the ingathering of the Jews to the Promised Land is the ultimate ingredient that sets the stage for the Second Coming.</p>
<p>We are commanded to turn to Ezekial 38: 23, as LaHaye reads aloud the prophecy of Jesus revealing himself to all, believers and non-believers alike. "God is going to bare his strong arm in such a way that all the world - the most atheistic heretics, the evangelists of atheism ... are going to drop dead, because of their rejection of God...</p>
<p>"Can you imagine being alive and witnessing a time when no one will dispute there is a God in heaven?"</p>
<p>A necessary reality-check: Long before Barack Obama ever held office, this reporter was well familiar with Israel's place in the born-again Christian narrative, having logged five years at the Toronto Star's Jerusalem Bureau.</p>
<p>And truth be known, it's an awkward place. Men like LaHaye - and millions of American evangelical Christians besides - stand as the Jewish state's most ardent supporters.</p>
<p>Yet Israelis understand all too well that support is driven mainly by Biblical prophecy - and if you read the fine print, on Judgment Day the Jewish people also will be required to convert to Christianity or perish. Given that Israel is not exactly overflowing today with outside friends and supporters, most Israelis choose not to challenge this end-times scenario, which, to non-believers, is beyond wacky in any event.</p>
<p>The other thing many of us in the old Jerusalem press corps couldn't quite understand is why U.S. Christians would so willingly throw Palestinian Christians under God's bus.</p>
<p>I vividly recall one Bible-believing Baptist from Southern Ontario - she was marching in support of Israel down Jaffa Rd. in full Mountie regalia, and you just don't forget scenes like that - told me, "All the Palestinian Christians are gone. The only ones left are Muslims."</p>
<p>Wrong. She obviously hadn't crossed the checkpoint to the West Bank town of Bethlehem, where the annual Christmas Eve sermon is still delivered in Arabic. The original Christians may be few in number. But they are there.</p>
<p>But here in the born-again Bible Belt north of Atlanta - the wellspring for so many who think this way - I'm beginning to get it. It's not just the Palestinian Christians who fail their faith test. Tens of millions besides, including every Catholic, are also left behind.</p>
<p>Prophecy expert Frazier explained it all in "The Death of America and the Coming New World Order." Frazier scoffed at the notion that 80 per cent of Americans qualify as true Christians.</p>
<p>"I reject those figures. If 80 or 70 or 60 per cent believed the word of God, we would not have legalized abortion. We would not be having a debate over what marriage is.</p>
<p>"The fact of the matter is only seven to 10 per cent (of Americans) understand that salvation is through Christ alone in faith alone."</p>
<p>Extrapolating from those numbers, Frazier forecasts that "when that trumpet sounds, (no more than) 30 to 35 million Americans will be missing just like that. People think nothing could ever happen to the U.S.A., the greatest nation ever on the face of the Earth. But we live in perilous times.</p>
<p>"America is virtually haemorrhaging from within. America is currently under the judgment of God. The fact is we passed Sodom and Gomorrah a long time ago. And we're now reaping the consequences of a nation that has turned its back on God."</p>
<p>As Frazier leads the congregants through concluding remarks and a final prayer, he asks those who are ready to let Jesus into their hearts to come forward - and one by one, five men and women step forward to be born again.</p>
<p>Together they embrace Frazier at the pulpit, safe now in the promise of righteous eternity. The harvest may seem modest - but for the fact that just about everyone else in the room is already saved. Frazier knows this: Among us today are Sunday school teachers and ministers from other churches, all taking notes to help prepare their own sermons.</p>
<p>We are sent our separate ways with a final mantra, designed to assuage the shock of the day's message. "Prophecy is not written to scare us, it is written to prepare us," Hindson tells us one last time.</p>
<p>"It is not to frighten us, it is written to enlighten us. Come, while there is time."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Trip insurance a safe bet for summer travellers</b>

</p>
<p>With the spread of swine flu around the world, an insurance industry group is recommending that Canadians get trip cancellation/interruption coverage if they're planning to travel internationally this summer.</p>
<p>At least 30 countries have reported cases of the new strain of influenza A(H1N1), say public health officials.</p>
<p>"Canada has been cited by foreign government and health authorities as a key vector for transmission of the virus, and so Canadians might expect increased surveillance or questioning by border authorities when travelling abroad this summer," said Martha Turnbull, president of the Travel Health Insurance Association.</p>
<p>When obtaining insurance through a travel agent or other travel insurance specialist, Canadians should get "a clear, plain language explanation of their trip cancellation benefits and how they integrate with the benefits and exclusions of their air carrier, tour company or cruise line," said the association, which represents travel insurers.</p>
<p>Policies have limitations and exclusions, so travellers need to understand "where they stand should their trip to a given destination be suddenly cancelled, or should their destination resort close down, or should their government issue an advisory warning them not to travel to a certain country or parts of it," said Turnbull.</p>
<p>The Foreign Affairs Department issued a warning on April 27 against all-but-essential travel to Mexico. "Anyone who buys a travel insurance policy (for a trip to Mexico) after that time will not be covered for any trip cancellation/interruption and may not be covered for emergency health benefits while on their trip until the Canadian government rescinds that warning," the association said.</p>
<p>Top volunteer vacations</p>
<p>Work camps offered by a non-profit Canadian development organization are highlighted in the new book The 100 Best Volunteer Vacations to Enrich Your Life, published by National Geographic.</p>
<p>The Canadian Alliance for Development Initiatives and Projects, based in Vancouver, promotes projects that range from building hiking trails in Iceland to cleaning walls in the Old City of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Accommodations are nothing fancy, writes author Pam Grout: "You'll share a school or a cabin, or maybe even a tent, with members of your team."</p>
<p>Volunteers also split cooking duties and other household chores.</p>
<p>One project involved assisting a Brazilian's 16,000-kilometre journey in a solar car. The volunteers drove a support vehicle, set up solar arrays that charged the car's batteries and carried spare tires.</p>
<p>In the Comox Valley on Vancouver Island, volunteers participate in a summer camp program for children with autism. In another project, volunteers garden with seniors in Vancouver.</p>
<p>The organization's website lists projects around the world, in countries such as Austria, Bulgaria, China, Costa Rica, Egypt, France, India, Peru, Tanzania and Vietnam.</p>
<p>On the web: www.cadip.org[http://www.cadip.org].</p>
<p>Hail Caesar!</p>
<p>Caesar is being celebrated at a Calgary hotel.</p>
<p>The drink -- not the man -- is the focus of events at the Westin Calgary, which claims to be the site where a bartender invented the caesar cocktail 40 years ago.</p>
<p>The hotel has created a weekend package to mark the milestone and "savour all that is caesar."</p>
<p>Starting at $199 per night, the package includes accommodation for two adults, caesar cocktails, caesar-inspired appetizers and a caesar-inspired breakfast in bed.</p>
<p>In 1969 bartender Walter Chell created the caesar at the hotel, according to a news release.</p>
<p>"We like to think the caesar is regarded as a unique Canadian national treasure," said Ross Meredith, Westin Calgary's general manager.</p>
<p>The cocktail typically includes vodka, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and a blend of tomato juice and clam broth.</p>
<p>Eco-friendly travel</p>
<p>A scientists' group has put together a guide to green travel to help you determine which modes of transportation have the smallest carbon footprint, and the group says some of the greenest choices can also save money.</p>
<p>The Union of Concerned Scientists researchers compared the amount of carbon dioxide -- the chief heat-trapping gas that drives global warming -- from driving, flying, travelling by train or bus, and also compared per-person emissions for solo travellers versus those travelling in pairs or as a family of four. Here are some of their findings:</p>
<p>* For trips of more than 800 kilometres, if you're travelling solo or with one other person, it's greener to fly direct in coach than to drive, according to the UCS.</p>
<p>* First-class seating takes up more space than coach seating, so the average first-class passenger on a domestic flight is responsible for generating twice as much carbon as someone seated in coach, UCS says.</p>
<p>* Compared with flying coach, a couple travelling on a bus will cut their trip's carbon dioxide emissions 55 to 75 per cent, depending on the distance travelled. Compared to even a fuel-efficient hybrid car, a bus trip would cut a couple's trip emissions nearly in half. Bus travel is usually less expensive than flying and for a solo traveller, can be cheaper than driving.</p>
<p>* The type of car you use for a road trip makes a big difference. An SUV emits nearly four times the amount of carbon dioxide emissions of an efficient hybrid such as a Toyota Prius and uses nearly four times the amount of gas.</p>
<p>* Travelling off-peak can also lower your carbon footprint and travel bills. Spending less time in traffic means better mileage and lower fuel bills; flying off-peak means your plane won't be wasting fuel in a holding pattern and your ticket could be cheaper.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The flu virus retrieved from a pig on an Alberta farm closely matches the swine flu viruses retrieved from humans, an expert in genetic sequencing says.</p>
<p>"It's 99 per cent identical to one of the Mexican sequences," Steven Salzberg said yesterday of the genetic code for the hemagglutinin, the protein that gives the H1N1 virus the H in its name.</p>

</p>
<p>Burlington has its first case of swine flu as the virus continues to spread across Halton and Hamilton.</p>
<p>The Burlington woman was one of six new cases in Halton yesterday, bringing the total number of ill to at least 23. Of those, 18 are students from seven different schools -- six of them in Oakville and one in Georgetown.</p>
<p>Hamilton also reported an adult woman sick with H1N1, bringing the total here to three cases.</p>
<p>No one in Halton or Hamilton has been hospitalized and all are mildly ill or recovered.</p>
<p>All of Hamilton's cases are in people who recently travelled to Mexico. That is in stark contrast to Halton where the virus is spreading in the community partly because students are going to school sick.</p>
<p>Hamilton and Halton day care centres started receiving educational material this week to help them teach toddlers how to properly wash their hands -- considered the single most effective way to stop the spread of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>In total, 12,000 packages paid for by the federal government were sent out to day cares across Canada as part of a handwashing awareness campaign by the Canadian Institute of Child Health (CICH) and the Canadian Consumer Speciality Products Association.</p>
<p>"That's hugely important," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health. "When we talk about our main messages, that is one of them -- frequent handwashing, knowing how to wash your hands properly and start when the kids are young. I think that's a fabulous initiative and I'm glad it's being done."</p>
<p>Across Ontario, there were 32 new cases of H1N1 yesterday bringing the number of ill to 187.</p>
<p>All but one have been mildly ill.</p>
<p>Letters to parents went out yesterday to the schools in Halton with new cases.</p>
<p>So far, H1N1 has been diagnosed in students from Christ The King high school in Georgetown and Oakville's Lorne Skuce public elementary, T.A. Blakelock high school, St. Luke Catholic elementary and Falgarwood public elementary. Two other unidentified Oakville schools have also had students sick with swine flu.</p>
<p>Nosal says the virus is still spreading in the community and far more people are sick than the 23 confirmed by the province's central public health laboratory.</p>
<p>"More cases are reported all the time," he said. "As we speak, new cases are coming in."</p>

<p>Whitby, Ont. -- • Job losses are tearing apart communities, such as my own in the riding of Whitby-Oshawa. Canada is in the midst of a war in Afghanistan, confronted by international terrorism, faced with a humanitarian crisis in Sri Lanka, and concerned about the fate of Pakistan's nuclear arsenal. H1N1 has created a worldwide health scare, our environment is under threat. We count on our Prime Minister for serious answers to the challenges of our time. Mr. Harper has assured us he has a carefully thought out plan to tackle the grave problems we face as a country. We take him at his word. After countless hours of deliberations, cabinet meetings and international summits we now know his answer: attack ads.</p>
<p>The ads' text talks about Michael Ignatieff but their subtext says far more about Stephen Harper, his priorities and his style of leadership.</p>

<div>BURIED TREASURES / CARLYN ZWARENSTEIN REDISCOVERS THE HORSEMAN ON THE ROOF, BY JEAN GIONO</div>
<div>Book Review</div>

</p>
<p>One of my favourite books belongs to a time-honoured, yet oh-so-unfortunately-zeitgeistful literary micro-genre, the plague novel. Among the great inventions of infection are Albert Camus's The Plague, Gabriel García Márquez's wondrous Love in the Time of Cholera and Jose Saramago's Blindness. As well, Camus, Boccaccio and Petrarch, Pushkin and Chaucer were all inspired by the ravages of the Black Death, and most writers in the genre owe a debt to Daniel Defoe's 1722 A Journal of the Plague Year. Meanwhile, the germ that will become the definitive SARS novel or the great H1N1 romance remains latent on somebody's hard drive somewhere.</p>
<p>Published in 1951, The Horseman on the Roof (Le Hussard sur le toit) is a delicately written, rollicking and profound masterwork by Jean Giono, a French writer born in Provence. Giono wrote dozens of other novels, collections of poetry and plays, and died in 1970. This novel describes the experiences of Angelo, a young Italian noble who had been banished from Italy to France after a duel, and who passes through cholera-stricken Provence on his way back home.</p>
<p>The great, giddy delight of this book lies in its shameless buckling of swashes, its joyous derring-do. Add to that an unexpected but pervasive humour, conveyed mostly through the dissonance between the hero's idealistic way of thinking and his rather foolish aspect (but as we come to see, his commitment to his ideals is deeper than one supposes at the outset). Angelo, you see, is a young fop, an aristocrat with a purchased army rank who nevertheless believes in the great virtues of courage and loyalty. The humour comes out through his awkward, wordy, contradictory, overweening but endearing internal monologues:</p>
<p>“But I'm up to my neck debating with myself problems of such difficulty that it would be a great relief to be attacked by some really determined cutthroats, out for my purse and with no chance of avoiding the galleys or even the guillotine except by desperately threatening my life. I think I'd take them on with real joy, even on that little narrow staircase I see over there – though it would make swordplay difficult.”</p>
<p>Yes, he's a blowhard. But like that other boastful military aristocrat, Savinien de Cyrano de Bergerac, Angelo has a good heart, genuine courage and, most of all, a profound sense of humanity.</p>
<p>The book's “where” is stated, and painstakingly described. The action takes place in villages and the same searingly bright, almost hallucinogenic landscape that drove Vincent van Gogh off his rocker. But “when” is less clear. Although the talk of duels and cholera, and much description of humble peasants, leads one to imagine a medieval or Renaissance setting, anachronisms like modern colloquial language and the odd mention of a steam engine confuse the issue and give the story a nice edge. Jean-Paul Rappeneau's 1995 film based on the book, with Juliette Binoche and Olivier Martinez, explicitly sets it during the 1832 cholera epidemic in France, which seems plausible. Most of all, the humorous, self-analytical tone that characterizes Angelo's many internal monologues suggests a distinctly modern sensibility, and the essentially humanist considerations in the book are very similar to Camus's 1947 novel.</p>
<p>“Night encouraged selfishness. People brought their dead down into the street and threw them on to the pavement,” we read. Then: “ ‘Did they love one another?' said Angelo. ‘Lord, no,' said the nun. ‘In a town like this, though, there are surely people who loved one another?' ‘No, no,' said the nun.”</p>
<p>The Horseman on the Roof has had its indelible effect on me, I think, because of Angelo's brave, generous, romantic, insane belief in putting your life on the line for others. That generosity is conveyed through the language of the book itself too. My book (may I call it mine?) is clear, humorous and meticulously attentive to the balance and rhythm of sentences, and also to precise, never flabby description. Such care makes you feel the benevolent presence of the author as he registers and records the beauty and sorrow of the world. Here is an example of the writing, an early impression of the scorching, unearthly landscape where most of the story will take place:</p>
<p>“Clouds of dust, smoke, or mist, exhaled by the earth under the beating of the sun, were beginning to rise here and there, from stubble where the harvest had already been gathered, from little flame-coloured hayfields, and even from the forests, where one could feel the heat frying the last fresh blade of grass.”</p>
<p>And I have yet to really address the epidemic that dominates the book. Giono's descriptions of the truly revolting effects of cholera are perfectly precise and nausea-inducing. Time and again, a seemingly innocent scene is revealed to be full of horror. Time and again, we watch as reckless Angelo rubs the cold, blue limbs of dying strangers in the hopes of saving their lives.</p>
<p>Equally awful is the suspense as you wonder who will be struck next. Angelo meets people who risk their lives for others, and he meets many more whom fear has hardened and rendered callous. Both kinds of people suffer the same fate. When he meets Pauline, who you just know is to be his own true love, the dénouement is set in motion as we wonder in agony: Will she live?</p>
<p>Henry Miller, quoted on the back of my copy, has it right when he says, “In Giono's work what every sensitive, full-blooded individual ought to be able to recognize at once is ‘the song of the world.' ”</p>

<p>Three Regina schoolchildren are among the 22 new cases of H1N1 flu confirmed Friday across the province.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan's case count now sits at 39, but a number of those individuals have already recovered. All but one of the flu cases is classified as "mild," with one adult still being assessed in Regina, said Dr. Maurice Hennink, deputy medical health officer for the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region.</p>
<p>No one has required hospitalization.</p>
<p>The five new cases found in Regina Qu'Appelle include three students and an adult from Jack MacKenzie School. Don Hoium, director of education with Regina Public Schools, said the school division has stepped up the frequency of cleaning of shared surfaces at all schools and continues to emphasize the importance of frequent hand-washing.</p>
<p>The school division and the health region are also hosting a parents' meeting at the school on Wednesday at 7 p.m. to field any questions, Hoium said.</p>
<p>"We've been very pleased with the messages that Regina Qu'Appelle health and the Ministry of Education have provided us to relay to parents and so far we have had good response from parents. If children are feeling ill, they're keeping them at home and contacting their health-care provider," Hoium said.</p>
<p>Because Jack MacKenzie is part of a shared facility that includes St. Gabriel Elementary School, Regina Catholic Schools said parents are also being informed of the recent cases and are invited to attend next week's meeting.</p>
<p>Because the virus has generally caused mild illness, it's expected additional numbers of people in Saskatchewan have had the flu strain but recovered at home without being tested, said Dr. Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"The increase in cases (reported Friday) is partly due to an increase in testing, but it's also probably an increase in the amount of virus that's circulating in the community," she said, adding she expects to see numbers grow and perhaps taper off toward the end of next week.</p>
<p>"We're keeping a close watch to make sure there are no serious cases."</p>
<p>Cases break down by health region as follows: Regina Qu'Appelle, six; Saskatoon, 26; Prince Albert Parkland, three; Heartland, two; Kelsey Trail, one; and Sun Country, one.</p>

<p>This is the first "non-mild" case of the H1N1 flu virus in Ontario.</p>
<p>While it wouldn't provide further details, the Ministry of Health did issue a press release stating: "All of the cases reported to date, with the exception of one, are considered mild. One person, who has a case of the H1N1 flu virus, has been hospitalized with a number of underlying medical conditions."</p>
<p>The flu tends to hit hardest those with existing medical conditions or weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>There have been 187 confirmed cases in Ontario to date, including 32 added to the list yesterday.</p>
<p>Andrew Morrison, a ministry spokesperson, said he's not at liberty to discuss individual cases. But he confirmed four people have been hospitalized in Ontario so far. In three cases, hospital stays were brief. As for the patient still in hospital, Morrison said it's difficult to characterize the severity of the illness.</p>
<p>"The person is in ICU (intensive care unit) with underlying medical conditions," he said, noting the existing medical problems make it "a bit complicated to just characterize the flu ... ."</p>
<p>Toronto Western Hospital is part of the University Health Network.</p>

</p>
<p>Premier Dalton McGuinty's harmonized sales tax is more than a year away but Ontarians already resent it, a new survey suggests.</p>
<p>Even though consumers will not be paying the 13 per cent levy until July 1, 2010, there is growing anxiety about the tax's impact on pocketbooks, according to a Nanos Research poll done for the Toronto Star and La Presse.</p>
<p>"It's pretty clear that Ontarians are concerned about the potential negative effects of harmonization," company president and CEO Nik Nanos said yesterday.</p>
<p>Nationally, 48 per cent of Canadians see tax harmonization as a negative move while 34 per cent believe it is positive and 18 per cent are unsure. (Quebec, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Newfoundland have already harmonized their consumption taxes.)</p>
<p>But in Ontario, 67 per cent of people polled have a negative view of the melded tax compared to 23 per cent seeing it as positive and 10 per cent unsure.</p>
<p>Nanos Research interviewed 1,001 people across the country from April 25 to 30 and results are considered accurate to within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>In Ontario, 302 people were surveyed and provincial results are accurate to within 5.7 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>Across Canada, 28 per cent felt the business-friendly streamlined tax would boost Ontario's struggling economy while 32 per cent feared it would hurt the province with 25 per cent neutral and 16 per cent unsure. In Ontario, 21 per cent believe it will be positive and 51 per cent said it would have a negative effect with 21 per cent neutral and 7 per cent unsure.</p>
<p>McGuinty wasn't available to the Star yesterday, but he recently noted that Ontarians aren't yet that aware of the fact the 8 per cent provincial sales tax is being melded with the 5 per cent GST.</p>
<p>"I think most folks haven't heard about it. Human nature being what it is, we live in a 1,000-channel universe, it's swine flu, it's the world recession, it's the auto sector, all those kinds of things," the premier said last month.</p>
<p>"As we get closer to July of next year then they're going to stare into the face of it and better understand what it's all about," he said April 29.</p>
<p>Nanos said the government is going to have to explain the intricacies of a tax reform that will raise the levies on everything from a morning coffee and muffin to gasoline and heating fuel to funerals and new homes costing more than $500,000. "Otherwise, they could be in for a very rough ride."</p>
<p>The Liberals clearly appreciate that challenge, which is why the government is lobbying the auditor general to loosen the rules against partisan political advertising.</p>
<p>It is believed McGuinty hopes to launch an ad blitz in the run-up to July 1, 2010 touting the $1,000 in rebate cheques that most families will receive from the federal government to offset the higher costs of numerous products and services.</p>

<p>The symptoms started about three weeks ago with tightness in his chest and pain when he coughed.</p>
<p>Santini Gale had had bronchitis before and thought he might be coming down with it again. So he went to a walk-in clinic at Six Points Plaza in Etobicoke, where he says he was sent away with a seven-day supply of antibiotics.</p>
<p>But the 27-year-old's symptoms only worsened and 10 days later, on May 4, he went back to the clinic.</p>
<p>"The pain doubled. It crippled me. I knew I had to go back to the doctor because something wasn't right," he recalled yesterday.</p>
<p>Extensive tests were done at the clinic but results weren't immediately available. Gale said he was sent home, this time with a bottle of cough syrup, and went straight to bed.</p>
<p>His symptoms worsened to include dizziness, nausea and fever. The pain in his chest grew and he was hit with a severe headache.</p>
<p>His mother, Evelyn Gale, wanted him to go to hospital that night, but he didn't have the strength to get out of bed, he recalled.</p>
<p>"I didn't eat. All I did was sleep for two days," he said.</p>
<p>One night his sheets were so drenched with sweat that they had to be changed three times.</p>
<p>When, on May 6, he finally did go to Etobicoke General Hospital - part of the William Osler Health Centre - he was feeling so cold that he had to wrap himself in several layers of clothes.</p>
<p>"If I didn't make it to hospital, I thought I would die. I thought I would go to sleep and never wake up, it was that bad," he said.</p>
<p>"I was going from cold to hot. I was vomiting and disoriented."</p>
<p>The hospital treated him for dehydration, and even gave him a spinal tap and a test for meningitis. He was put on the antiviral drug Tamiflu and given more antibiotics. For the pain - severe headaches, chest pain and general body aches - he got morphine.</p>
<p>After two nights in intensive care, he was sent home on May 8.</p>
<p>Two days later, Toronto public health called and informed him he had the notorious swine flu.</p>
<p>"It was the worst flu I've ever had in my life," he said yesterday. "I couldn't move. I felt like I was going to die, I could hardly breathe."</p>
<p>According to medical experts, infection with H1N1 virus can range from no symptoms at all to feeling like you've been hit by a truck.</p>
<p>Gale was clearly in the latter category.</p>
<p>"I have never felt like that," he said. "It almost felt like your body was shutting down."</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first day Gale could leave his home and he wanted everyone to know he is no longer contagious.</p>
<p>He has been given the all-clear to return to work on Tuesday. He juggles two part-time jobs - one at Canada Post, where he loads parcels onto trucks, and the other at Pearson airport, where he works on the "ramp crew" for Air Canada. This involves some passenger contact when he loads luggage onto small planes, but Gale cannot say for certain where he picked up the virus.</p>
<p>His story came to the attention of the Star when his mother phoned to ask why provincial medical authorities were telling the public that no one had been hospitalized with H1N1 and why all cases were being described as mild.</p>
<p>Andrew Morrison, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Health, clarified yesterday that to date four people with the virus have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>In three cases, patients were discharged after being assessed and went home to recover. A fourth patient, who has pre-existing medical conditions, remains in hospital.</p>
<p>Todd Leach, a spokesperson for William Osler, confirmed one patient with flu-like symptoms had been hospitalized there.</p>
<p>He said admission to the intensive care unit may not have been necessary but was done "to be extra vigilant and to ensure the patient responded to treatment."</p>
<p>Leach said the case was characterized as "mild" because the patient did not require ventilation to assist with breathing.</p>
<p>Gale, however, said from his perspective the illness he endured was anything but mild.</p>
<p>"That's crazy," he said of the hospital's characterization.</p>
<p>"It's been hell. That's the first time I've had to spend a night in hospital in my life."</p>

</p>
<p>Almost two-thirds of Saskatchewan patients diagnosed with the H1N1 flu live in the Saskatoon Health Region, according to provincial statistics.</p>
<p>On Friday, Dr. Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer, announced a spike in the number of cases provincially and locally.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan, 22 new cases of the influenza were confirmed. Of those, 14 patients were from Saskatoon and area. Saskatchewan's case count now sits at 39, with 26 of those patients living in Saskatoon and area.</p>
<p>It's not clear why the numbers are so high, but Dr. Cory Neudorf, chief medical health officer for Saskatoon Health Region, has some ideas.</p>
<p>"It seems like more testing is going on for the virus in our province and, specifically, in Saskatoon there seems to be more testing by Saskatoon doctors than in other parts of the province, which might explain why we are seeing more cases in Saskatoon," he said.</p>
<p>Neudorf doesn't think it's because more people in the Saskatoon area are sick. The health region is working to increase awareness among doctors of the importance of testing for viruses.</p>
<p>About 10 per cent of the samples that have been sent to the provincial laboratory in Regina to be tested for the H1N1 strain of influenza A have been positive. The rate of positive tests is the same for the Saskatoon area as it is for the province.</p>
<p>Most of the patients in the Saskatoon Health Region who have tested positive live in Saskatoon. None of the 14 patients have been hospitalized. While they range in age from six or seven to the mid-50s, about two-thirds of the patients are under the age of 20. There are no "obvious clusters" in schools or communities, says Neudorf.</p>
<p>"This virus is now in the community. It is circulating. This isn't just among travellers now," he said.</p>
<p>Four of the five new cases reported in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region on Friday are connected with one school.</p>
<p>With three students and one adult from Jack MacKenzie school testing positive for the virus, the Regina public school division and the health region will be hosting a parents' meeting on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Regina Public Schools has also stepped up the frequency of cleaning of shared surfaces at all schools and continues to emphasize the importance of frequent hand washing, says Don Hoium, the division's director of education.</p>
<p>Health officials expect the number of people who actually have become ill with the H1N1 virus is even higher than the numbers that have been reported. Because the virus has generally caused mild illness, many people have probably had the flu strain but recovered at home without being tested, said McKinnon during a regular media briefing in Regina. She expects to see numbers grow and perhaps taper off toward the end of next week.</p>
<p>The total number of cases by health region is: Saskatoon, 26; Regina Qu'Appelle, six; Prince Albert Parkland, three; Heartland, two; Kelsey Trail, one and Sun Country, one.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stay between the bulls and the bears; Keep your views balanced lest you fall into a trap</b>
</div><div>Peter Hodson   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>676 words</div><div>16 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP14</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>As an investor, it is important that you keep your viewpoint balanced. Every time you sell a stock you hate, remember, there is someone on the other side who thinks it just might be the greatest thing ever.</p>
<p>Bullish investors, for example might look at all the "green shoots" in the economy and conclude the worst is over and it is party time for the stock market. Bears might only watch for the negative news confirms their bearish viewpoint. Investors must keep an open mind, lest they fall into one trap or the other.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at some recent data points and see how they can be skewed toward a certain viewpoint. Like every stock trade, though, there are two sides to everything:</p>
<p>The markets: Stock markets worldwide have had a huge recovery. Trough to current levels, some markets are up 30%, 40% or even more. The financial index alone was at one point up 88% since its March low.</p>
<p>The bears out there say this is nothing more than a giant, vicious bear-trap. As the market heads higher, it sucks in more and more investors who are afraid of missing out on gains. Investors have lost track of economic realities, the bears say, and are about to be handed their heads.</p>
<p>The bulls, on the other hand, have a different perspective. They say the piles of cash on the sidelines, low valuations, low interest rates and green shoots imply all is clear on the equity front. The best gains, the bulls add, are always in the early stages of a recovery. My take: An equity rally does not mean we are out of the woods economically. Use some caution. Bears point.</p>
<p>Retail sales: Bulls point out that <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and other retailers are posting better-than-expected retail sales, which might mean the consumer is back buying things. The bears point out that maybe consumers were recently simply stocking up on items because of pandemic fears, and this caused retail sales to improve temporarily. Once consumers start hiding out in their homes, retail sales are going to fall off a cliff. Who's right? Not sure on this one, both bulls and bears have a point here. Sales are sales, but we need continuation.</p>
<p>H1N1 Virus: It is remarkable, the bulls say, how markets have shrugged off virus fears and have powered higher. That might point to the resiliency of the stock market and the economy. The bears say "just wait." The flu fear happened just as the economy might have been turning, and it could be the final blow to an already-weak economy. My take: While it is unlikely that we will all become flesh-eating zombies wandering through the shopping malls, the virus fears have to have an overall dampening impact on the economy. One point for the bears.</p>
<p>Jobs: Canada recently reported 37,000 new jobs were created in April. The bulls see it as a positive swing from the loss of 50,000 jobs that was expected. Job creation is the final sign that the economy has turned, they say, and it might be time to go all in on equities. Just wait a second, the bears counter. The jobs number is primarily jobs that workers created themselves by starting businesses. Basically, that implies that these workers couldn't find a job and had to start trying to earn money on their own. Point: bulls.</p>
<p>Look at all the facts, and stay objective. If you are looking at your side of the equation only, you are missing at least half of the picture.</p>

<p>Twelve Montrealers - including adolescents and primary-school children - have contracted H1N1 influenza, raising the total number of cases so far in Quebec to 38, public-health authorities said yesterday. All the infected individuals are recovering at home with mild cases of the so-called swine flu, said Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's Public Health Department.</p>
<p>"We're still in a scenario of a virus that has a weak virulence, which is something in which we take great relief," Poirier said. None of the new cases are concentrated in any one school, he added.</p>
<p>Of the total of 38 cases in the province, 20 individuals are now symptom-free and are no longer confining themselves to their homes.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the number of confirmed cases of H1N1 jumped yesterday from 3,352 to more than 4,000 in 47 states plus the District of Columbia, health authorities said.</p>
<p>The virus was confirmed in 4,298 people in the United States, said the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in its daily report.</p>
<p>Only four states have not seen the virus - West Virginia, Mississippi, Wyoming and Alaska.</p>
<p>The northern state of Illinois tops the list with 620 confirmed cases, followed by Wisconsin (510), California (473) and Texas (439).</p>

</p>
<p>Professor of swine health management and epidemiology at the Ontario Veterinary College</p>
<p>Given the recent hysteria about pork and pigs, it amazes me that Canadians eat at all.</p>
<p>Pork is a safe, wholesome and nutritious food choice, a fact muddied by an official from the World Health Organization who mixed half-truths with inaccuracies in an alarmist statement that circled the globe. He raised fear and doubt because he hadn't taken the time to read the science that clearly refutes his statements.</p>
<p>First, it's important to realize people cannot become ill from eating pork because the meat cannot be infected with the influenza virus. In a pig, the virus grows only in the lungs and upper respiratory tract; it doesn't go into the blood stream or muscles.</p>
<p>To become infected with the influenza virus, a pig has to share the same air space as another pig or a person who is infected with the virus. An infected person who sneezes or coughs produces up to 20,000 droplets. Each droplet carries many viruses. When these droplets are inhaled by a pig, it becomes infected with influenza. Once inhaled, the influenza viruses begin to multiply in the pig's respiratory tract.</p>
<p>To multiply, a virus must enter a cell. The influenza virus attaches to a receptor site on the outside of a cell. Only cells in the respiratory tract – lungs, nose, trachea, bronchi and bronchioles – have these receptor sites. Once inside, the virus enters the cell's nucleus, where it unravels itself and then makes copies of each of the genetic components. These copies rejoin to make many copies of the virus that invaded the cell in the first place. Cells in the blood stream and the muscles do not have receptor sites for the influenza virus. Hence, the virus cannot live, grow or multiply in these tissues.</p>
<p>When a pig infected with the influenza virus sneezes or coughs, the air around the pig is filled with droplets that contain virus particles. A new pig will become infected when it breathes in these droplets. A person working in close proximity to the pig may also become infected. The person needs to breathe the same air as the pig if the virus is to be transmitted from a pig to a person. Pigs do not shed the virus for long: They begin shedding it one day after becoming infected, and stop shedding after seven days.</p>
<p>Pigs infected with the influenza virus will have a high fever, stop eating, look depressed and spend most of their time lying down and sleeping. They are reluctant to get up or walk around. These clinical signs are due to the body's reaction to the virus.</p>
<p>Rest assured that a sick pig will not make it to your plate. Pigs that arrive at an abattoir in Canada are examined by a veterinarian or health inspector before they are processed. If a pig is ill or fevered, it is euthanized on arrival at the abattoir. It is not mixed with the other pigs; its meat is not used for human consumption.</p>
<p>Canada's food safety standards are among the most stringent in the world. Strict guidelines, based on the Canadian Quality Assurance program, govern how farmers raise pigs. It is an on-farm quality-control program that is administered by government officials and veterinarians.</p>
<p>By using the adjective “swine” when describing this H1N1 influenza A human pandemic, we have effectively bankrupted many Canadian pork producers. Because the value of a pig has dropped 13 per cent, it now costs more to feed a pig than the farmer receives in return. He is losing money on every pig he sells.</p>
<p>The bottom line: Pigs are not responsible for this pandemic and pork is safe. This H1N1 influenza A virus is spread from one person to another person. Our reaction to the word “swine” has hurt our farmers. It's time to act. The only way the price of pigs will go up is if Canadians eat pork from pigs raised in Canada. Put pork on your fork!</p>

</p>
<p>Onthe same day health authorities reported two southern Albertans suffering from H1N1 flu are in hospital, a senior medical officer said assessing the situation in the province is complicated by seasonal flu and other wintertime respiratory viruses.</p>
<p>Such seasonal viruses have stuck around longer than normal, said Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services. That means if there's a flu outbreak-- at a nursing home, for example--more people must be tested because it can't be assumed they're all infected with the same virus.</p>
<p>Predy said the situation hasn't caused any delays in testing and it's unclear why such seasonal viruses are still circulating, as flu season typical ends in April.</p>
<p>One of the people with H1N1 who is hospitalized is a boy from the Calgary area. The other case involves an elderly woman from southern Alberta who's in a Lethbridge hospital.</p>
<p>"It's not anything that's all that unusual. Even with our seasonal flu, we see more people being admitted to hospital with these kinds of respiratory symptoms that she's developed after this infection," Predy said.</p>
<p>In the case of the woman, she recently travelled to Mexico. But that's not so for the child. In such cases, Predy said, it's a matter of determining if the person had contact with some-one who was travelling.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert doesn't believe there's any reason why more Albertans are being diagnosed with the flu and hospitalized because of the illness.</p>
<p>"I don't think we should necessarily set our hair on fire because we've had another situation where someone has been hospitalized," he said. "I'm sure the medical community is being overly cautious."</p>
<p>There are now 67 confirmed cases of H1N1 in the province. Five people in Alberta have been hospitalized. That includes a woman from northern Alberta who died last week. On Thursday, the province said an autopsy report was inconclusive about what role H1N1 may have played in her death.</p>
<p>"These results were not unexpected,"Alberta's chief medical officer, Dr. Andre Corriveau, said in a statement. "Some people are more susceptible to the flu than others.</p>
<p>"In all cases with chronic pre-existing medical conditions, those patients are always at greater risk, and even when we do further testing, it is not always clear what the immediate cause of death may have been."</p>
<p>As the province tracks H1N1, Predy said the number of cases of pneumonia in certain areas are also being monitored.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Riggers our last team standing; 10 things you should know about the Roughnecks</b>
</div><div>Nick Lewis   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>1034 words</div><div>15 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>It's OK. We know you've been busy, caught up in playoff hockey, Star Trek on the big screen and that season finale of Lost. You've been distracted by the buzz around swine flu and liquor prices going up, and how dreamy that Adam Lambert is on American Idol--oh, it's just been a crazy spring.</p>
<p>So amid all this, it was tough for you to know that our professional lacrosse team, the Calgary Roughnecks, was destroying the competition in the National Lacrosse League playoff run. And tonight, these heavy hitting lads are on the cusp of winning their second National Lacrosse League championship as they take on the New York Titans at 7:30 p. m. at the Saddledome.</p>
<p>You've been there from the start, though, right? Of course you have.</p>
<p>Don't worry, we're here to help you jump on that bandwagon as gracefully as you can, without calling attention to yourself. We want to help you so you can help our Calgary Roughnecks bring home that cup (something we saw in a Kevin Spacey movie about paying it forward).</p>
<p>So unpack that red garb you put away when both the Flames and the Hitmen got knocked out of their playoffs. Rush the box office for some last-minute tickets. Your Roughnecks need you.</p>
<p>To help you fully appreciate tonight's thriller, here are 10 things you should know about our Roughnecks.</p>
<p>1 Kaleb Toth is the Jarome Iginla of the Calgary Roughnecks, both in spirit and on the scoresheet. The assistant captain scored 33 goals and 80 points this season, both team highs. He is playing in his third NLL championship tonight after winning with the Toronto Rock in 2000, and then the Roughnecks in 2004. His last-second goal in 2000, to give the Rock a 14-13 win over the Rochester Knighthawks, is considered one of the all-time greatest in the short history of the league. It was also the last goal to ever be scored at Maple Leaf Gardens.</p>
<p>2 The Roughnecks are also called the Riggers, much like the Montreal Canadiens are also called the Habs. The Roughnecks are also the last professional Canadian sports team left in any playoffs this spring.</p>
<p>3 Spoiled rich athletes? Hardly. Most NLL players have day jobs outside their commitments with their teams, as the average pay is $14,500 a season, and top pay is $25,000. Riggers defender Bruce Codd is a supermarket manager in Orangeville, while goalie Matt King is an elementary school teacher in Duncan, B. C. Ironically, his rival across the rink, Titans goalie Matt Vinc, is also an elementary school teacher in St. Catharines, Ont.</p>
<p>4 The top-seeded Roughnecks secured home floor advantage throughout these playoffs after a franchise-best 12-4 regular season record, including five straight wins to open the season. To get to the championship game, they rocked the No. 4 seed Colorado Mammoth 15-8 in the West Division Semifinal, then eliminated the No. 3 seed San Jose Stealth 17-5 in the division final.</p>
<p>5 Despite a stellar year in the record books and some fantastic action on the floor, the Roughnecks are averaging under 10,000 fans per game during these playoffs. It's a sharp drop-off from 2004, when a sellout crowd of 19,289 fans watched them win the cup.</p>
<p>6 In the spirit of competition, Calgary Mayor Dave Bronconnier and New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg have a friendly wager on tonight's final. If the Roughnecks win, Bloomberg will send Bronconnier Irish stew and shepherd's pie from Mary's Celtic Kitchen in Woodlawn, stuffed grape leaves, moussaka and spinach pie from Pinocchio Palace in Astoria, and an assortment of meats and cheeses from Enzo's of Arthur Avenue in the Bronx. If the Titans win, Bronconnier will send Bloomberg a supply of world famous Alberta beef, Italian sausage from Spolumbo's Fine Foods and Deli in Inglewood and beer from the local <span class="companylink">Big Rock Brewery</span>.</p>
<p>"My hat is off to our friend Mayor Bloomberg," Bronconnier said. "He's pulling out all the stops to support his team, offering a taste of some of New York's most interesting neighbourhoods. I do feel a bit bad, though. I mean, it's going to be a lot of work for him to pick up all that stuff for us on Saturday morning!"</p>
<p>7 Here's some basic rules about the game itself. Each team dresses 18 players, consisting of two goalies and 16 "runners." A team consists of five runners and a goalie. Games consist of four 15-minute quarters, and tied games at the end of regulation are decided with a sudden-death overtime. Like hockey, there are both two-minute penalties and five-minute major penalties, and like basketball, there is a 30-second shot clock.</p>
<p>8 Between players on the Roughnecks and the Titans, there are a combined 15 pro cup rings on the floor tonight. Kaleb Toth (Riggers) is going for his third, while Titans' Dave Stilley will be vying for his fourth.</p>
<p>9 If you'd like to attend tonight's final, you can still purchase tickets at <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span>. Tickets start as low as $15.75, with the top price being $86.62. Stampeders QB Henry Burris will be doing the ceremonial ball drop at the game. If you'd rather stay at home, you can listen to the game on radio on the FAN 960.</p>
<p>10 All 23 active players on the Roughnecks roster are Canadian. If you'd like to send them a word of encouragement for tonight's game, write them an e-mail at NoiseForTheBoys@CalgaryRoughnecks.com. Each message will be directly passed onto the players on game day to help pump them up for the big matchup.</p>

<p>An autopsy on a northern Alberta woman who died after catching H1N1 influenza was unable to determine whether the virus played a role in her death.</p>
<p>The 39-year-old woman from Gift Lake Métis Settlement died in hospital in April after catching the virus from unknown sources. She also had asthma and diabetes.</p>
<p>"The report does not clarify what role the H1N1 virus may or may not have played in her death," Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said in a news release on Thursday. "These results were not unexpected. In all cases with chronic pre-existing medical conditions, those patients are always at greater risk," he said, adding the woman had a mild strain of the virus.</p>
<p>Provincial health officials said six new cases of H1N1 were confirmed on Thursday, bringing the number to 67 cases in the province. Twenty-four of the cases are from the Calgary area, 18 from the Edmonton region, one from southern Alberta, 14 from central Alberta and 10 from the north.</p>
<p>Mild symptoms have been reported in all but five of the cases. A woman from southern Alberta and a boy from Calgary have been hospitalized. A girl is still recovering in an Edmonton-area hospital.</p>
<p>Of the confirmed cases, 30 had travelled to areas affected by the virus; nine had contact with travellers to affected areas; 16 cases had no travel connection and 12 cases have travel or exposure histories yet to be determined.</p>
<p>The provincial government has also released a guide for workplaces in the event of a pandemic, although the risk on most sites is low.</p>
<p>Corriveau said the its expected the H1N1 virus will re-appear in the fall or winter.</p>
<p>"Our advice remains the same: stay home if you are sick, wash your hands often, and sneeze or cough into your sleeve, not your hand."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu expected to top WHO's agenda; H1N1 virus now has spread to 33 nations as World Health Organization prepares for annual assembly in Switzerland</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>402 words</div><div>15 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will travel to Switzerland this weekend to attend the World Health Organization's annual assembly, where the outbreak of H1N1 swine flu -- which has spread to 33 nations -- is expected to dominate discussions.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq is heading a delegation of Canadian health officials and while in Geneva for the World Health Assembly she plans to meet with WHO director-general Margaret Chan, as well as her U.S. and Mexican counterparts. She will also participate in a panel discussion on the virus that originated in Mexico and has hit the U.S. the hardest with more than 4,000 confirmed infections.</p>
<p>Among the topics that will be reviewed during the meetings is whether to direct manufacturers to begin production of a vaccine against the virus.</p>
<p>"It's an international joint decision," Aglukkaq said Thursday after appearing before the House of Commons health committee.</p>
<p>Expert scientists convened by WHO had a discussion Thursday about whether mass production of a vaccine should be undertaken. Acting assistant director-general Keiji Fukuda said in a briefing for reporters that "no big decisions" had been made and that more meetings are needed.</p>
<p>If the UN agency does recommend that manufacturers proceed with a vaccine for the virus, it would disrupt the production of seasonal influenza vaccines which is why, according to Fukuda, the decision requires careful consideration.</p>
<p>The seasonal flu causes three to five million cases of severe illness a year and according to WHO, kills between 250,000 and 500,000. In Canada, it is estimated that between 4,000 and 8,000 people can die of influenza and its related complications yearly.</p>
<p>The recent outbreak of H1N1 in humans has so far killed 65 people worldwide and infected 6,497 people, WHO reported Thursday.</p>
<p>However, that figure did not include the jump in cases in the U.S. that was reported Thursday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of confirmed cases in the U.S. rose by 946 and now stands at 4,298.</p>
<p>Only West Virginia, Mississippi, Wyoming and Alaska have escaped the spread of the virus.</p>

<p>Re: Five more in Prairies test positive for flu, May 11.</p>
<p>The continued reporting of actual cases of H1N1 flu for Mexico, United States and Canada, which are the high incidence countries, is meaningless.</p>
<p>A better and more informative measure would be to record cases per million population. Using the case numbers in the article and population figures for Mexico at 1,626 for 111 million, Canada at 286 for 33 million) and the United States at 2,254 for 307 million, we can calculate the numbers of cases per million population as Mexico at 14.6, the U.S. at 7.3 and Canada at 8.6. This shows why people should not be concerned about travel to the United States as the relative risks in Canada and the U.S. for this flu are similar with the U.S. which is slightly lower at this time.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Public health officials have confirmed a third case of the H1N1 flu in Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>It was one of 36 new cases announced in Ontario yesterday, bringing the provincial total to 155.</p>
<p>The latest local case occurred in an older adult who has fully recovered and did not require hospitalization. All of Ontario's cases have been mild.</p>
<p>Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, the region's associate medical officer of health, said the latest case doesn't have a link to Mexico or to any other confirmed case. However, she said these "community cases" are beginning to outnumber those with a connection to recent travel.</p>
