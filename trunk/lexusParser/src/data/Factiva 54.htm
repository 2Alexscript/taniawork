<div id="hd"><b>Flu added to camp worries - Officials say none will be closed</b>
</div><div>By Kevin Rollason </div>

</p>
<p>POISON ivy and sunburns used to be the main worries when children went to summer camp.</p>
<p>Now there's a new one: H1N1.</p>
<p>But as Manitoba school kids get ready to blast off into summer vacation -- and begin heading to camp this week -- both provincial health officials and camp directors say while no camps will be closed, the same flu prevention methods used by school and day cares should be taken at camp.</p>
<p>"Whether it's a school, day care or a summer camp, it's handwashing and cover your cough," advises Dr. Elise Weiss, Manitoba Health's spokeswoman for H1N1.</p>
<p>In the United States, at least one annual summer camp has decided to fold up its tents in response to the swine flu threat.</p>
<p>Last week, the Muscular Dystrophy Association decided to cancel the rest of its annual summer camp program for Jerry's Kids because of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The MDA said it decided to cancel its 47 remaining camps, which would have seen 2,500 children go camping, because of concerns that children with MD have "weakened respiratory muscles".</p>
<p>The MDA said the decision to cancel the camps was made after consulting with officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta which concurred MD children were at "high risk for complications from the flu virus".</p>
<p>In Manitoba, though, ill or recovering campers are getting the same advice as regular campers:</p>
<p>"The number one step for prevention is if you're ill, stay home. If they're ill before camp starts they shouldn't go, they should stay home," said Weiss.</p>
<p>Noelle Bowles, camp director of Camp Quality, the special week-long camp for children living with cancer, said at this point they're going ahead with their camp in mid-August.</p>
<p>"We'll be extra careful," Bowles said.</p>
<p>"We're also telling our volunteers if you're sick, don't come to camp this year."</p>
<p>Bowles said because the camp does include some children in remission or undergoing cancer treatment, they are already vigilant about watching out for illnesses.</p>
<p>"We always have hand sanitizer and soap," she said.</p>
<p>"Some of the children are immune-compromised so we are always careful and we'll continue to be careful."</p>
<p>Martin Johnson, spokesman for the Firefighters Burn Camp, said the children going to their camp are heading out today.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Economy zaps Canadian tourism; Longest decline since 9-11</b>
</div><div>Derek Abma and Mike Barber </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>481 words</div><div>30 June 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>D6 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star </div>
</p>
<p>The economic downturn has sent Canada's tourism industry into its longest -- although not the most severe -- tailspin since the 9-11 terrorist attacks on the United States, according to a report released Monday.</p>
<p>Tourism spending fell 1.3 per cent in the first three months of this year, Statistics Canada said, marking the third straight quarterly decline. In total, spending fell 2.4 per cent over the last three quarters.</p>
<p>"This was the first time tourism spending has fallen for three consecutive quarters since 2001, when the tourism sector, already in a downturn, was hit by the events of Sept. 11 and their aftermath," the federal agency said.</p>
<p>"Subsequently, with the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak, tourism demand fell 5.8 per cent over the first and second quarters of 2003."</p>
<p>Randy Williams, president of the Tourism Industry Association of Canada, said the declining numbers can be mostly attributed to the weakened North American economy.</p>
<p>"(Travelling) is discretionary spending, for leisure or business, and in many cases, people are postponing trips to when they'll be more affordable," said Williams.</p>
<p>David Redekop, an analyst with the Canadian Tourism Research Institute, said the actual situation is "not as bad as it appears."</p>
<p>He said domestic travel is actually "holding up quite well," and much of the decline in this area is due to lower prices for things such as hotel rooms rather than a lack of activity.</p>
<p>Spending by international visitors fell 5.7 per cent in the first quarter -- the 14th drop in 17 quarters, "and the sharpest decline since the SARS outbreak during the second quarter of 2003," Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>Redekop said the international numbers largely reflect the long-term trend of declining travel from the U.S., and it's expected to get worse with new requirements that American visitors to Canada have a passport or other accepted document in order to return home by land.</p>
<p>Foreign visitors to Canada cut their spending in all areas in the first quarter, Statistics Canada said, particularly transportation and food-and-beverage services, which were both down eight per cent for the quarter.</p>
<p>Canadians's domestic travel spending was down 0.1 per cent in the first quarter.</p>
<p>"This was the first time domestic tourism spending has declined for three consecutive quarters since 2001," it said.</p>
<p>Transportation spending was down 1.2 per cent for Canadian travellers.</p>
<p>Due to a lack of residents travelling abroad, spending for air travel in this country was reduced by 2.5 per cent in the quarter, Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>These latest tourism figures do not take into account any effect that might come from the recent swine-flu scare. But Redekop said this is not expected to be a major factor for the tourism industry.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pregnant women warned of flu risk</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>877 words</div><div>30 June 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star </div>

<p>Pregnant women and those with underlying risk conditions, such as chronic heart or lung disease, should avoid crowds to reduce the risk of being exposed to human swine flu, federal health officials said Monday.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer says there is no evidence to suggest pregnant women are at greater risk of contracting the H1N1 influenza A virus. But, if they do become ill, pregnant women -- especially those in the third trimester -- are at higher risk of serious complications.</p>
<p>As women get closer to their due dates, their immune systems change, making them more vulnerable to serious illness -- not just from influenza, but from other infections as well, Dr. David Butler-Jones said. That can put stress on the fetus, and, in rare cases, increase the risk of an early birth or fetal death.</p>
<p>"It is very important for pregnant women to take precautions to help prevent infection in the first place and to seek medical advice if they do develop influenza-like illness," he said Monday.</p>
<p>"People with underlying risk conditions and pregnant women should consider avoiding crowds to reduce the risk of exposure to the virus," he added.</p>
<p>"You need to be practical about getting on with life," Butler-Jones said. But he said pregnant women should avoid situations where they would be close to crowds for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones also said Monday that serious cases are also occurring in people who were healthy "before catching this virus" and that the infection rapidly progressed into severe illness requiring ventilators.</p>
<p>"We're tracking these cases very closely, trying to understand from a medical standpoint why they would be affected this way by the virus, and whether this is a signal that the virus itself is changing and becoming more virulent," or if other factors are at play, he said.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones also warned that in addition to a fever and a cough, anyone who develops serious respiratory problems, such as shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, should seek immediate medical care.</p>
<p>The risk of children picking up swine flu at daycare or day camps is generally low, he said, similar to what it would be in schools.</p>
<p>However, the risk might be higher in sleep-away camps, where children live in close quarters and for prolonged periods.</p>
<p>"The message of prevention is critical, at school, camp, daycare, home or at work," Butler-Jones said. "That means washing hands, coughing or sneezing into your arm and avoiding others when we're ill. Not just today, not just for this outbreak, but always."</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will be meeting with her international counterparts and World Health Organization officials in Mexico this week to discuss H1N1.</p>
<p>Overall, the vast majority of cases in Canada appear to be mild, "but we are seeing some pockets of more severe illness," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>As heightened surveillance continues, "we can expect case numbers to continue to increase and, given the sheer numbers of people who are catching this virus, we can also expect to see more severe cases and, unfortunately, more deaths as well."</p>
<p>Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer confirmed a woman in her 40s died on Saturday, the province's second reported death related to swine flu.</p>
<p>The first patient was a man in his 70s. Both had serious underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>As of late Monday, 7,983 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus had been reported in all provinces and territories in Canada. There have been 636 hospitalizations, and 25 deaths.</p>
<p>Preliminary data shows that the majority of those infected are under the age of 20, and that relatively few people over age 65 have contracted the virus. Older people normally account for about a quarter of infections during regular seasonal flu, "so this is quite different," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>He said that once a vaccine is available, the logic would be to provide the vaccine to those who are most likely to get it, or get severely ill.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two studies from the New England Journal of Medicine published online Monday have shed some new light on the virus.</p>
<p>A method for mapping the world's air traffic patterns was able to accurately predict how the H1N1 virus would spread around the world, according to research published in the journal.</p>
<p>Toronto-based scientist and infectious disease physician Dr. Kamran Khan and colleagues analyzed the flight itineraries of the more than 2.3 million passengers departing Mexico on commercial flights during the months of March and April.</p>
<p>They found a strong correlation between the international destinations of air travellers leaving Mexico and confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus around the world.</p>
<p>SWINE FLU IMMUNIZATION</p>
<p>Canada aims to start immunizing its population against the new H1N1 flu virus in October but has not yet decided who should be a priority for getting the shot, the country's top public health official said on Monday.</p>
<p>"We're hoping that we'll be on track for having the vaccine, start immunizing in late October so that we can complete immunizing before Christmas," Dr. David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer at the Public Health Agency of Canada, told reporters on a conference call.</p>

</p>
<p>Pregnant women and those with such underlying risk conditions as chronic heart or lung disease should avoid crowds to reduce the risk of being exposed to human swine flu, federal health officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer said there is no evidence to suggest pregnant women are at greater risk of contracting the A(H1N1) influenza virus. But, if they do become ill, pregnant women - especially those in the third trimester - are at higher risk of serious complications.</p>
<p>As women get closer to their due dates, their immune systems change, making them more vulnerable to serious illness - not just from influenza, but from other infections as well, Dr. David Butler-Jones said. That can put stress on the fetus, and, in rare cases, increase the risk of an early birth or fetal death.</p>
<p>"It is very important for pregnant women to take precautions to help prevent infection in the first place and to seek medical advice if they do develop influenza-like illness," he said.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones also said serious cases are occurring in people who were healthy "before catching this virus" and that the infection rapidly progressed to severe illness requiring ventilators.</p>
<p>He said anyone who develops serious respiratory problems, such as shortness of breath, or difficulty breathing, should seek immediate medical care.</p>

<p>Ottawa. <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> prefers Canada's tax rate</p>
<p>In an indication that Canada is starting to be considered a low-tax place to do business, <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons Inc</span>. announced Monday plans to shift its registration of operations from Delaware to Canada for tax purposes. Analysts say this is also a sign of unease among corporations regarding the U.S. business environment, where taxes are likely heading upward to deal with trillion-dollar deficits and proposed health-care reforms; and the White House is looking to crack down on companies that invest abroad. In Canada, the federal corporate tax rate is headed to 15 per cent in 2012. And the federal Conservative government has called on the provinces to get to a 10 per cent business levy by the same time frame for a combined 25 per cent rate on corporate income. Alberta is already at 10 per cent, British Columbia will be there in 2011, Ontario by 2013, and New Brunswick will go down further, to eight per cent in 2012. In the United States, the top corporate tax rate is in the mid-30 per cent range.</p>
<p>New York . Royal Caribbean earnings hit by higher fuel costs</p>
<p>Higher fuel prices and the H1N1 flu virus will hurt <span class="companylink">Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd</span>'s full-year earnings, the world's second-largest cruise operator said Monday. Royal Caribbean said its full-year fuel expenses could be 12 cents US per share higher at today's oil prices, which have leaped 45 per cent since the company provided its outlook in late April. The impact of surging oil was partly blunted by hedging strategies. Miami-based Royal Caribbean previously had said it expected full-year earnings of $1.35 per share, and a 10 per cent change in fuel prices would result in a 10-cent-per-share change in 2009 earnings. Analysts expect the company to earn $1.09 per share, according to Reuters estimates.</p>
<p>Ottawa.Commodities super-cycle returning, Scotiabank says</p>
<p>Canada's key commodities have reversed their dramatic declines and are headed for years of renewed strength as the Chinese "dragon" rekindles an Asian-led super-cycle in basic materials, says Scotiabank commodities expert Patricia Mohr. Driven by record levels of imports into China, Scotiabank's commodity-price index climbed 2.2 per cent in May from April, the month in which the 45 per cent slide from July 2008 peaks came to an end, according to Mohr. "China's dragon has breathed life back into commodity prices," Mohr said.</p>
<p>Calgary. Alberta to fast-track drought payouts</p>
<p>Alberta is trying to speed up payouts to farmers whose crops have failed because of dry conditions this spring. The <span class="companylink">Agriculture Financial Services Corporation</span> said Monday it is sending adjusters to the most seriously affected regions in the province amid a growing number of claims. For the first time, the crop insurance agency will use average area yields to assess pre-harvest claims, said Alberta Agriculture Minister George Groeneveld.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada aims to start immunizing its population against the new H1N1 flu virus in October but has not yet decided who should be a priority for getting the shot, the country's top public-health official said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We're hoping that we'll be on track for having the vaccine, start immunizing in late October so that we can complete immunizing before Christmas," Dr. David Butler-Jones, chief public-health officer at the Public Health Agency of Canada, told reporters.</p>
<p>"There are many things that need to take place between now and then, so everything still looks on track, but there's still much work to do," he said.</p>
<p>Drug-makers are gearing up to mass produce vaccines against the new virus, also known as swine flu, and governments have reserved millions of doses as the World Health Organization declared a pandemic.</p>
<p>Yet other countries are not sure yet whether even to give the vaccine to anyone and if so, who should get it. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it had not yet decided if it will recommend people get the new shots when flu season arrives in North America this fall.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said Canada would try to learn as much as possible about the virus's behaviour before deciding how to proceed with an immunization campaign.</p>
<p>"Right now, we're looking at what's happening in the Southern Hemisphere [where it is winter], we're looking at what's happened in Canada and the priorities we'll develop," he said.</p>
<p>"We won't get the vaccine all at once [but] we'll be starting to immunize," he said.</p>
<p>The vaccines for seasonal flu will be ready earlier in the fall and some people may need to get two shots, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>So far, 21 Canadians have died from swine flu and 496 have been hospitalized.</p>

<p>Re: Pandemic planning not priority for business, June 29.</p>
<p>Thank you to the Citizen for underscoring the importance of business continuity planning to build Ottawa's capacity and resiliency to deal with potential increases in absenteeism due to the continued spread of the novel H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>We know from past observation that an influenza pandemic could occur in one or more waves, each lasting about eight weeks. A second wave may occur within three to nine months of the initial outbreak wave and may cause more serious illnesses and deaths than the first.</p>
<p>We strongly encourage local businesses and organizations to establish strategies for maintaining their essential services in the event of higher-than-usual absenteeism.</p>

<p>Wednesday, I went with my son to see an early showing of the new Transformers movie. The theatre was about two-thirds full.</p>
<p>I usually sit in the back row of the front section of seats, at the end. On this occasion, a family sat in the centre of the same row.</p>
<p>After a while, it was quite evident that at least two of them had colds, as they coughed and hacked their way through the movie.</p>
<p>Now, we all get colds at one time or another even with flu shots, but most of us are decent enough to stay home or out of close contact with others. What is particularly disturbing to me is all the talk about H1N1 and how it still isn't under control.</p>
<p>I don't think these people were being very considerate, coming into a public place with all their coughing and who knows what else?</p>

<p>- The way we celebrate Canada Day is like married sex:Get it over with fast and don't make too big a deal of it, because we'll be doing it again next year. - Some people can drink eight or 10 beers and just stop. Not me. I always seem to drink to excess. - If you need lime flavour in your beer to make it taste good, maybe you should buy better beer. - I have a sinking feeling the foofaraw over Michael longer than I will. Jackson will last - What exactly does Rev. Jesse Jackson do besides show up for photo ops at disasters and calamities, such as Michael Jackson's tragic death? Doesn't he have a real job to go to? - No offence, but what did Michael Jackson do in the "giving back" department? - Maybe Madonna can adopt Michael's kids. - Close the City Centre Airport, move Calder Yards north of the city limits, and develop both areas--just as we did with the old CN yard downtown.</p>
<p> - If the airport is closed, how long will it remain behind metal fencing while they clear fuel out of the ground, like at that gas station on Whyte Avenue? If it's going to take 25 years, leave the airport open. - We already had a referendum in 1995 to close the Muni. If there is another one that decides to keep it open, we should have a third vote in 14 years to break the tie. - City council is going to rush this airport deal through without thinking about the congested traffic problem. It's the same thing as happened at South Edmonton Common. - David Staples is doing an excellent job reporting on the Mayerthorpe story. I hope his series will unlock a few closed minds. - So Mayor Mandel is "129 million billion zillion per cent behind Mike Boyd." Obviously he's spent too much time studying the city's budget deficits. - I wonder if police Chief Boyd followed the new no-swearing policy when he first saw the posters of himself. - Chief Boyd should stick to his guns. All he is asking from his force is professionalism and not the goon and bully mentality the Edmonton police are known for. - Even more distracting than Dancing Dan are those uniformed guys that jump out into traffic from behind radar guns to wave at passing motorists. They should be cited for stunting. - It's a puzzle how parents who allow their 14-year-olds to wander the streets until 6 a. m. are suddenly amazed when the kids get into trouble. - Before being issued a driver's licence in Alberta, you should be required to submit to an evaluation of your anger-management skills. - Another weekend of beautiful construction weather has come and gone and at city construction sites, nothing was happening. How much longer must Edmontonians put up with an administration that doesn't yet realize our construction season is very short? - Hang up the damn phone and drive. You just aren't that important that it's worth risking my life. - Only the Alberta government would spend $3 billion to spur drilling during a time of depressed prices--only to create bigger surpluses that will further depress prices. - Back in the 1970s, we were being told we would be out of natural gas by the '90s. They must have meant the 2090s. - Health Minister Ron Liepert says Albertans deserve a system that delivers the care they need when they need it and that is their goal. Conservative governments have been saying this for 20 years, so what's new? - Why is the province shutting down six STARS helicopter pads because they don't meet federal regulations when federal regulations haven't changed for 20 years? - The government might as well shut down all the hospitals, sell the ambulances and be done with it. - Hmm, self-serve soup at Alberta Health Services hospital cafeterias --can you say H1N1? - The new Art Gallery of Alberta looks like an ordinary building that was sprayed with Roundup.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Canadian researchers have designed a system based on air travel patterns to predict how infectious diseases will spread around the world, offering a means of halting transmission by taking preventive measures as soon as an outbreak occurs.</p>
<p>The system, developed by infectious disease physician Dr. Kamran Khan and colleagues, accurately predicted how the H1N1 flu virus would circulate worldwide after arising in Mexico earlier this year.</p>
<p>Using their BIO.DIASPORA system, the team analyzed the flight itineraries of more than 2.3 million passengers who departed Mexico on commercial flights during March and April 2008 to predict the spread of H1N1 a year later.</p>
<p>The findings show the international destinations of air travellers leaving Mexico -- including cities in Canada -- were strongly associated with confirmed importations of the virus around the world.</p>
<p>"We know that infectious diseases don't respect national boundaries, but if there is one thing they have to respect as they're spreading around the globe, it's the architecture of the airline transportation system,'' said Khan of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.</p>
<p>"This is their mechanism for spreading around the globe.''</p>
<p>Khan said he came up with the idea of using the air traffic grid to better understand the global transmission of infectious disease after the 2003 SARS crisis. That outbreak killed more than 770 people, including 44 Canadians.</p>
<p>"It just became so obvious how the airline transportation network was a major conduit of the spread of infectious diseases,'' he said, noting that SARS arose in China's Guangdong province and it "didn't take long for it to be in 26 countries.''</p>
<p>In what Khan calls a case of "bizarre timing,'' days before he and his team were to deliver a report on BIO.DIASPORA to the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), news began trickling out about a new flu virus in Mexico. Their system allowed them to track its spread as it quickly infiltrated populations in one country after another.</p>
<p>"The movement of passengers out of Mexico aligned very nicely with the observed spread of H1N1,'' said Khan, principal author of a paper on the initiative published online this week by the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>John Brownstein, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Harvard University, said that while it's long been known that influenza is spread by air passengers, using flight information to track H1N1's movement "was a very unique and interesting aspect of the study.''</p>
<p>"The data that the authors use is widely available, so although it has a Canadian-centric view, which is obviously important . . . this type of modelling strategy is definitely generalizable to other countries,'' Brownstein, who was not involved in the study, said yesterday from Boston.</p>
<p>The obvious next step, said Khan, is to use the system for prevention. Canada is particularly vulnerable to infectious disease threats via air travel and because of our proximity to the United States, he pointed out.</p>
<p>"Collectively, when we look at Canada and the United States, we generate and receive about one-sixth of the entire world's international air traffic. That's a lot for two countries.''</p>
<p>Brownstein, who has studied the global circulation of influenza via air travel, said he doesn't believe any system can stop an infectious disease like flu, because passengers can be incubating an infection but show no symptoms.</p>
<p>"I think . . . these models can help prioritize and help prepare, but they can't necessarily at the end of the day prevent the introduction of this influenza.''</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Meet the 'Mediatrician'; He aims to educate parents on children's media use and is pushing for it to become a public health issue</b>
</div><div>Andrea Gordon   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>936 words</div><div>30 June 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>His first career was a Hollywood filmmaker. At 33, he headed to Harvard Medical School and became a pediatrician.</p>
<p>Today, Dr. Michael Rich has combined his passions for media, health and kids in a new role: "The Mediatrician."</p>
<p>Rich's mission: making children's media use a public health issue. The father of four, an avid user himself, knows technology has revolutionized childhood.</p>
<p>But he stresses the content and amount that kids watch, play and listen to must be monitored.</p>
<p>It affects all aspects of health, from how physically active they are, to their mental health, attitudes and relationships.</p>
<p>Rich, 55, has delivered that warning for five years as founder of the Center on Media and Child Health at Children's Hospital in Boston.</p>
<p>This month, the research centre launched a new website called Ask the Mediatrician where Rich answers parents' questions on everything from the pros and cons of Baby Einstein to how to intervene with teenage Xbox junkies. (You'll find it at askthemediatrician.org.)</p>
<p>The Star spoke to him by phone:</p>
<p>Q: What's your main theme?</p>
<p>A: That children's media use changes them. I'd like to see it approached with the same level of scrutiny and self-awareness that we approach their nutrition or education because it has as profound an affect. It's like the air they breathe and the water they drink.</p>
<p>Q: Why the new website?</p>
<p>A: I spend a lot of time teaching pediatricians, teachers and parents around the country what the data are. Consistently after I speak, the stage gets rushed by people with very specific questions about their kid - "My 8-year-old wants a cellphone. What should I be thinking about?" or "I can't get my kid off the video games, what do I do? or "How much TV is too much?" The idea is this is sort of like Dear Abby.</p>
<p>Q: What is the biggest misconception parents have?</p>
<p>A: That their kids' media use is an annoyance but it doesn't really hurt or affect them. Kids are always learning. We think they go to school and learn the important stuff and then they turn their brains off when they go home and play Grand Theft Auto, but that doesn't happen. Media are always modelling behaviour for kids. All media are educational; what varies is what they teach.</p>
<p>Q: And your approach?</p>
<p>A: It's not all about negative "turn it off, it's bad." It's about learn it, love it and use it wisely rather than just flip it on and let it wash over us.</p>
<p>Q: What do you hear from parents?</p>
<p>A: A lot are uneasy about their kids' media use but they also feel overwhelmed. They feel they don't have anything substantive to hang their hat on other than "you're irritating the hell out of me." So what we're trying to do is get the research in front of them, the data on which they can make decisions.</p>
<p>Q: Any tips on setting household limits?</p>
<p>A: Instead of having rules, have expectations. For example, a rule about TV time would be no more than an hour or two a day. An expectation would be that television is part of varied experience but something you do when the essential activities have taken place - school, homework, sleep, time with your family, physical activity. It's sort of like dessert.</p>
<p>Q: So what about the 12-year-old who wants to veg in front of Simpsons reruns or video games?</p>
<p>A: You can put the sand in the oyster. Move toward this idea that you do other things first. For now you've got an hour, but then the TV goes off and you find something else to do. Take it out of the realm of the emotional and become very businesslike about it.</p>
<p>Q: Are you an old hand on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter, the BlackBerry?</p>
<p>A: Yup. I love media. I have an iPhone in my pocket. I have a 10-foot screen in my basement. I have a huge collection of movies. But what I don't have is television in the bedrooms or the living room. I treat it as essentially a fine art that I go to consciously to spend time with.</p>
<p>Q: Who came up with the term "mediatrician?"</p>
<p>A: I did, probably in the shower.</p>
<p>Q: Is it likely to become a pediatric subspecialty any time soon?</p>
<p>A: No, I'm too jaded to think so. I see this sort of like the smoking issue. It's going to take a generational change for people to start thinking of media not as right or wrong or moral or immoral, but to recognize there are measurable changes that occur from exposure.</p>
<p>Q: Are physicians concerned?</p>
<p>A: Some pediatricians are starting to get it and include it in medical histories they take for kids' annual checkups. A lot aren't, in part because it doesn't rise to the top when you're dealing with nutrition, growth and development, immunization, swine flu or whatever the latest fear is. I think it needs to. In many ways, this is the environmental health issue of the media age.</p>

<p>"How many opportunities do you get to steal home and the manager doesn't mind it? So I figured I could give it a shot. ... They're definitely not expecting that with two strikes. The key is obviously getting out there far enough, but also kind of surprising someone."</p>

<p>Manny Ramirez's minor league rehab tour continued Sunday without a word from the suspended slugger. Ramirez didn't produce any hits, either, a day after hitting a leadoff homer for the Dodgers' Class A Inland Empire 66ers. It was the fourth minor league rehab game for Ramirez, who is scheduled to return from his 50-game ban and rejoin the Dodgers on Friday.</p>

<p>KISS the Grand Marshal</p>
<p>The original God of Thunder will be on hand at the upcoming Honda Indy Toronto. Gene Simmons, bassist/vocalist for classic rock stalwarts Kiss, has been named grand marshal for the July 12 race, organizers announced Monday. Simmons, who co-founded Kiss more than 35 years ago, was involved in the global marketing of the IndyCar Series for several years through his partnership in Simmons Abramson Marketing. The Honda Indy Toronto takes place July 10-12 which coincides with the southern Ontario leg of an upcoming Kiss Canadian tour, including a two-night stand at <span class="companylink">Casino Rama</span>'s 5,000-seat Entertainment Centre on July 20-21.</p>
<p>Flu Fears at Wimbledon</p>
<p>Wimbledon officials had to play down swine flu fears Monday after four ball boys and girls were asked to stay home with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Ian Ritchie, the chief executive of the All England Club, issued a statement about the flu cases and asked all visitors and personnel to stay away from the championships if they develop any symptoms.</p>
<p>However, All England Club spokesman Henry O'Grady said there was no reason to suspect that swine flu had reached the tournament.</p>
<p>"There's no one that has swine flu," he said. "There are a couple of people that have flu symptoms, and as a result they've been asked to stay at home. ... They haven't been tested for swine flu, and they're not going to be tested."</p>

<p>Should we really be surprised that some decision-maker in Ottawa delayed shipment of hand-sanitizer to First Nations groups in Manitoba, for fears the substance contained alcohol?</p>
<p>Yes, a paper-pusher in Ottawa thought that some aboriginals might drink hand-sanitizer.</p>
<p>First off, let's accept that some First Nations groups have substance abuse problems. But does that really mean that we -- or more importantly, the bureaucrats running the country -- must assume that any material containing alcohol will be misused?</p>
<p>The appalling thing in this latest federal blunder is that the delay affected shipment of material deemed necessary to help curb the spread of H1N1 that is ravaging aboriginal populations.</p>
<p>Did we really need delay? Of course not. Moreover, the flimsy reasoning for the delay should cause some concern. First Nations groups are naturally -- and rightfully -- outraged, not just at the federal stalling, but the presumptive reason for it. It does much to demonstrate some of the prejudice First Nation groups have to battle on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Ponder, for a moment, how any of us should feel if we were denied access to a simple household material on the assumption -- the bigoted and prejudiced assumption -- that it would somehow be misused for some other reason than its original purpose.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The H1N1 influenza outbreak on reserves in Manitoba took centre stage on the national news agenda early last week when a Senate committee summoned federal health officials to explain what was going on.</p>
<p>It was nice to see this issue actually getting the attention from the federal government it should have been getting from the moment the first cases showed up in St. Theresa Point.</p>
<p>But it also brought home how far away Ottawa can be from the on-the-ground realities in Canada.</p>
<p>Several minutes of debate were spent on whether or not it could possibly be true that communities in Canada don't have running water.</p>
<p>One senator even acknowledged he'd never even been to a remote reserve.</p>
<p>When the members of a committee tasked with studying aboriginal issues don't even know that many reserves in remote areas of this country don't have running water, it's no wonder these communities have been unable to shed Third World living conditions.</p>
<p>It also is discouraging that one of the chief recommendations to the committee was an independent task force to figure out what went wrong and develop solutions before the fall, when the virus is expected to make a potentially more menacing appearance.</p>
<p>British Columbia Senator Larry Campbell at least got a few laughs when he pointed out having a task force complete any sort of meaningful work by the fall is unlikely.</p>
<p>"It will be fall before they even figure out who will be on it," he quipped.</p>
<p>Also of note at the committee was one senator, whose name I didn't catch, who seemed tired of listening to Health Canada officials explain all the reasons why everything is under control on the affected reserves, despite so much evidence to the contrary.</p>
<p>"One of the things that always amazes me about civil servants," the senator said dryly. "You always give the impression things are OK."</p>
<p>But in the middle of the hearing, there was at least a sign that one senator in that room got that the outbreak of H1N1 is a symptom of the ills of our reserves and what is required is more than just speeding up shipments of hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Conservative Senator Gerry St. Germain, the committee chairman, issued a call to arms to all governments in Canada to stop the status quo.</p>
<p>"Unless we do something differently we're going to continue to get the same results," he said.</p>
<p>"We've created a horror story out there as a society for the last 100 and some years for First Nations people. It's time the (Assembly of First Nations) and every group, the governments, oppositions, whoever, start working together and making a difference in First Nations' quality of life or else it's going to victimize all of us... We are the healthiest and the wealthiest and it's up to us to do something."</p>
<p>Last spring, I stumbled upon a rally outside the National Capital Commission offices. City councillors, Ottawa residents, and my own MP, the NDP's Paul Dewar, took turns trampling on the federal government for even thinking about locating the new Portrait Gallery of Canada outside Ottawa.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Conservatives shelved a plan to locate the gallery in the old U.S. embassy near Parliament Hill, and started a bidding process in which cities could compete for the gallery.</p>
<p>Although I love living in Ottawa, I am a westerner at heart, and it got my blood boiling to hear people suggest other cities in Canada are not worthy of having national institutions.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe one of the arguments was that keeping it in Ottawa would mean it would be open and accessible to a lot of visitors.</p>
<p>The issue died last fall when the government said it didn't have the money to proceed. But expanding the number of national institutions outside of the capital region continues.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced last week Pier 21 in Halifax will become a national immigration museum. It joins the Canadian Museum for Human Rights in Winnipeg as the only two national museums not in the capital region.</p>

</p>
<p>Heading home for the summer, they've had 233 days to learn on the job, which is five weeks longer than the average Canadian student's school year. That suggests the party leaders and Stephen Harper's cabinet have had enough time to absorb the briefing books, find their feet in question period and learn how to stamp out fires flaring inside their circle of responsibility. That means it's report card time for a mostly-mediocre group of leaders and senior ministers, grades based on outside observations (mostly mine) and confidential assessments from Hill staff, MPs and a trio of ministers.</p>
<p>- Prime Minister Stephen Harper</p>
<p>Swamped by a deep recession he didn't see coming, forced to crown himself the king of Canadian deficits and abandoned by the shrewd tactician skills which bestowed him with such a formidable reputation, Stephen Harper's grade reflects the probability he's at the mid-point of his annus horribilis.</p>
<p>Despite a strong stand against the Liberal ultimatums this week, he's but a shadow of the streetfighter who bare-knuckled the merged Conservatives to power in 2006.</p>
<p>If the polls don't improve by October, he risks being the leader who lost power (and shortly thereafter his job) barely a year after he was re-elected with a very strong minority. C</p>
<p>- Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff</p>
<p>He's reunited the party and nudged it into a tie with the Conservatives in almost every poll, restoring adult supervision and giving hope to its demoralized ranks. Fundraising has been ramped up and his outreach tours have attracted decent interest, even in Alberta. His Harper employment insurance extortion move didn't work -- bluffing never does against this prime minister --but at least it delayed a summer election to a time when he'll be better prepared and stand an improved chance of winning. B</p>
<p>- New Democrat Leader Jack Layton</p>
<p>While he's getting media-bashed all over as a dead leader talking, Layton has not been performing badly, merely predictably. True, he got all starry-eyed being a cabinet contender in the short-lived coalition, but at least he's kept up pressure in the Commons to bail out for the auto sector, was the first to advocate a national standard for accessing employment insurance and lead the attack against outrageous bonuses for Canadian Pension Plan executives. C+</p>
<p>- Heritage Minister James Moore</p>
<p>After losing an in-the-bag majority by offending Quebec over arts funding cuts, the Harper government needed this young, hip, friendly face for cultural damage control.</p>
<p>Tirelessly touring galas, festivals and theatre productions singing praises of the arts, his day is not complete without a funding announcement -- some of them artsy enough to make a hardened conservative wince.</p>
<p>Moore has been the class act of cabinet this year. A</p>
<p>- International Trade Minister Stockwell Day</p>
<p>He continues to perform extremely well as a minister, which is all the more impressive given his image meltdown from those jet ski days as the jettisoned Canadian Alliance leader. His relations-warming trip to China was welcome, his lumber industry bailout to combat the "black liquor" pulp mill subsidies in the U.S. was needed and he's leading the charge against "buy American" provisions. In cabinet, this Stock is on the rise. A-</p>
<p>- Justice Minister Rob Nicholson</p>
<p>The tough face of Conservative law and order allegedly has a sense of humour. I've never seen it. But he's pushed more legislation into the Commons than most other ministers combined.</p>
<p>It's his job to keep the base convinced there still is a conservative heart beating in Canada where hard crime does hard time and early parole is the faintest of hopes. B+</p>
<p>- Environment Minister Jim Prentice</p>
<p>He's no jolly green giant, but he's got a pragmatic streak that recognizes Canada's environmental rules and regulations must dovetail with the Americans, so we'd better join the Obama green parade before it runs us over.</p>
<p>Getting a carbon credit market up and running will be a headache and keeping the oilsands flowing into the clean, green, U.S. market will be a challenge, but he's earned Harper's confidence to work on difficult files without supervision. That new enlarged Nahanni National Park he rushed through the Commons in a single day last week, followed by the Senate the next morning, was a great start to his summer. B+</p>
<p>- Human Resources Minister Diane Finley</p>
<p>She doesn't exactly radiate empathy for a jobless epidemic depending on her department's employment insurance for survival, but she's a solid performer who knows the file and, despite being under constant attack in the Commons, does a reasonable job of defending EI as a hand up, not a handout. B</p>
<p>- Immigration Minister Jason Kenney</p>
<p>This workaholic shamelessly campaigns for Conservative votes through ethnic outreach and immigration permits, which is understandable given the misconception that new Canadians owe their landing rights to earlier Liberal governments.</p>
<p>Kenney's musings about compulsory language training and his desire to focus immigration on skilled labour are popular and his voice is heard and usually heeded around the cabinet table. B</p>
<p>- Infrastructure/transport Minister John Baird</p>
<p>There is substance here, although it's usually drowned out by the high volume of this political bullhorn. It's his job to deliver the drunken-sailor stimulus spending this government is rolling out, but there are mixed assessments of how successfully that staggering task is being done. Backed by the best staff on the Hill, he's juggling more issues than any other minister and has yet to drop the ball. B-</p>
<p>- Natural Resources Minister Lisa Raitt</p>
<p>If you forget the forgetfulness of her former communications aide, who left a tape recorder and documents in media hands, she remains a surprisingly solid rookie in a hot-button portfolio. The Calgary oilpatch likes her, no small feat for the Toronto-area energy minister, and she's still impressive under fire on the medical isotope mess. She should've immediately apologized for her inadvertently-taped comments on the sexiness of her isotope crisis, but fingers of blame for that delay point to the PMO. C+</p>
<p>- Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon</p>
<p>Let's face it. When global affairs heat up, a guy named Stephen Harper is the foreign minister. Mr. Cannon's job is to handle the thankless international duties while staying off the radar screen and this veteran does reasonably well on both those fronts. He projects an uninspired, gaffe-free, colourless persona to the world - which might make the media yearn for former minister Maxime Bernier, but keeps his boss happy. C+</p>
<p>- Industry Minister Tony Clement</p>
<p>He radiates all-Canadian geek and probably has a better feel for the wireless world than anyone in cabinet, but his auto sector bailout was unpopular and may well prove the sort of sucking-sound disaster that makes a Nortel salvage attempt look like a decent investment. And while he aims to wash his hands of the government propping up the <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> pension plan, that's exactly what happened -- a sleeper decision that set up the feds for endless what-about-us? grief from other ailing plans. C</p>
<p>- Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan</p>
<p>Yes, yes, he knows the material, but this impossible-to-like minister is considered arrogant by cabinet colleagues and is loathed by former staff. He's our point man in trying to put the fattening U. S. border on a diet and the government's eyes on terrorist matters, but hasn't yet recorded career-defining successes. C</p>
<p>- Defence Minister Peter MacKay</p>
<p>Sure they like him in the military ranks -- his new haircut makes him look like your basic battle group major-- but he's been short of stellar in delivering the hard goods. Everything from contracts for search and rescue planes to support ships and Arctic patrol vessels have been put on delivery slowdown or are on cost over-runs. He appears to lack the clout in cabinet to re-arm his portfolio and has enough restless ambition to have quietly lobbied for a NATO getaway job. C-</p>
<p>- Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq</p>
<p>This portfolio seemed like a sleepy rookie training ground at last October's swearing-in ceremony. But before you could say 'pig pandemic,' the portfolio was a front line target of feverish activity.</p>
<p>Then came the Chalk River medical isotope crisis. Yikes. On the horizon, a more virulent strain of swine flu. Ms. Aglukkaq has proven to be a decent script reader in public, but she's seriously over her head when topics stray off her talking points. C-</p>
<p>- Finance Minister Jim Flaherty</p>
<p>Sympathy must be spared for a minister squeezed between a revenue free fall and soaring employment insurance expenses and it's no secret his bizarre fiscal update last fall was tainted by prime ministerial meddling.</p>
<p>But it's Flaherty's job to wear the fiscal meltdown, even if nobody else could've done better if dealt this lousy hand. He cut taxes and eliminated contingency padding at the worst possible moment, rammed through a $3-billion emergency stimulus fund now being squandered on non-emergency items and raised the deficit to $50 billion with barely a shrug. At least in this report card term, nice guys do finish last pending, of course, his recovery with the economy. D</p>

</p>
<p>As the swine flu keeps spreading in defiance of expectations, many companies are quietly stockpiling emergency supplies of antiviral drugs to protect employees and profits.</p>
<p>"It's a sort of insurance," said Paula Allen, a vice-president at <span class="companylink">Shepell-fgi</span>, a firm that arranges employee-assistance programs for businesses. "There is an obligation to protect employees."</p>
<p>There have been 60,000 confirmed cases around the world so far of the H1N1 flu, which has been declared a pandemic. Up to now, the severity of the illness has been considered only moderate.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning has become big business in recent years, sparked by the SARS outbreak and fear of an avian flu pandemic. Where business continuity plans once focused mostly on computer failures, many now consider the possibility of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Employees are assets, said Allen, and employers want to protect their asset. "They don't want their businesses to collapse. They want their businesses to be strong and their customers not to find other sources during a pandemic."</p>
<p>The province has stockpiled enough antivirals to treat 25 per cent of Ontario's population should that many people fall seriously ill.</p>
<p>As a general rule, however, it does not stockpile antivirals for preventative purposes, or "prophylaxis." But exceptions are made for those in critical infrastructure, such as health care, transit and hydro.</p>
<p>Businesses are free to stockpile for preventative purposes, as long as an occupational health physician oversees the acquisition and dispensing of the drugs.</p>
<p>In the unlikely event the province needs more antivirals, it has the authority to commandeer inventories from drug manufacturers and businesses that stockpile them.</p>
<p>Laura Pagnotta, a spokeswoman for Roche Pharmaceuticals, said there has been a noted increase in demand for Tamiflu, the antiviral produced by the company.</p>
<p>The other domestic maker of antivirals is <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which produces Relenza.</p>
<p>At the World Conference on Disaster Management, held in Toronto last week, corporate risk managers and continuity planners were told that antivirals were the best way to reduce absenteeism and protect share prices during a serious pandemic.</p>
<p>"Employees are the main profit drivers," said Dr. Amin Mawani, from the Schulich School of Business at York University, noting that 15 per cent to 30 per cent of employees could be absent for eight to 16 weeks in a severe pandemic.</p>
<p>Mawani noted the World Bank last year estimated a severe pandemic could cost $3.1 trillion and shrink global GDP by 4.8 per cent.</p>
<p>The acquisition of antivirals is a closely guarded secret at many companies. That's because some acquire only enough for "mission critical" employees and there's a fear remaining employees would feel devalued.</p>
<p>Other companies see it as a competitive advantage and don't want to tip off rivals. Still, others fear the government could seize their inventory if its stockpile dwindled.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Officialdom's mantra about H1N1 flu -- "it is overwhelmingly mild'' -- might seem incongruous if we knew the number of children, teens and young adults in ICU beds right now alive only because a breathing machine has taken over for their ravaged lungs.</p>
<p>The heavy reliance on the word "mild '' could be creating a false impression of what is actually going on and what the world may face in coming months, some experts worry.</p>
<p>Peter Sandman, a risk communications guru from Princeton, N.J., suggests if authorities are trying to ensure people don't panic about the new H1N1 outbreak, they are concerned about the wrong thing.</p>
<p>"In North America, swine flu panic is much rarer than swine flu deaths,'' Sandman says.</p>
<p>"The problem isn't panic or even excessive anxiety. The problem is complacency, both about what's going to happen and about what might happen.''</p>
<p>When the new H1N1 virus burst onto the world's radar, it was, for awhile, the hottest story of the 24-7 news cycle. The long threatened pandemic, it seemed, was finally underway.</p>
<p>But instead of the 60-plus per cent death rate of H5N1 avian flu -- seen for years as the pandemic front-runner -- the wire was tripped by a seemingly wimpy virus that is causing a lot of flu, but is no viral monster.</p>
<p>In many places, public health officials have bent over backwards to tamp down anticipated panic. The results? Within a few weeks, most people appear to be convinced the pandemic was (past tense) a non-event, a blip of flu activity overhyped by the sensationalist media horde.</p>
<p>"When we're told that swine flu is mild, we don't think, 'It will infect a half to a third of the world population and kill a few million people, mostly young people, before it's over,"' says Sandman. "We think, 'It's like having a bad cold."'</p>
<p>Well, H1N1 flu isn't over. And it's not like a bad cold sweeping the globe.</p>
<p>But officials and experts are having a hard time striking the balance in messages to the public, unclear what they are dealing with now and what it might become.</p>
<p>"I think the problem is we don't know how to paint this picture properly,'' says Dr. Allison McGeer, a flu expert at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"Because it's perfectly true that most cases are mild. But it doesn't mean that you shouldn't worry about it.''</p>
<p>Regular flu, as anyone who has had it know, is no walk in the park. And with this new flu, a small subset of people gets very, very sick. Their lungs are overwhelmed by an aggressive viral pneumonia.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic planning not priority for business; Private sector more concerned about economy than H1N1 virus</b>
</div><div>Mohammed Adam </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1439 words</div><div>29 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>As Ottawa's medical officer of health makes an urgent call for business continuity plans across the city in anticipation of a resurgence of the H1N1 swine flu, a new survey shows most Canadian businesses are not prepared for a major H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>With experts fearing that the H1N1 flu will return in the fall in a more virulent form, Dr. Isra Levy is worried that a severe outbreak could cripple services across the city as workers stay home because they are sick, fear being infected or to take care of loved ones.</p>
<p>But in a survey last month, the Canadian Manufacturers and Exporters association found that 87 per cent of companies do not have business continuity plans for a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Jeff Brownlee, vice-president of the CME, says while the survey's findings are somewhat surprising, they are understandable in the view of the economic disruption Canadian businesses have faced lately. With the low probability associated with a major flu outbreak, pandemic planning tends to take a backseat, especially at a time when many businesses are facing real-time crises of survival.</p>
<p>"With everything that Canadian businesses have been hit with -- we've had a financial meltdown south of the border, we've had a volatile Canadian currency -- there's an economic tsunami to overcome and that becomes the priority," said Brownlee. "The way they look at it, this pandemic could happen, but the dollar is happening, and 'my customers are falling off.' That is the priority. Pandemic planning is sort of on their minds, but they take notice when it really happens."</p>
<p>Across Ottawa, contingency planning for a pandemic is a mixed bag of serious commitment and benign neglect, with the public sector more committed than the private sector.</p>
<p>John Herbert, executive director of the Ottawa Homebuilders Association, agrees with Brownlee's take. The OHA has 330 member companies employing more than 30,000 people, but Herbert says pandemic planning is not a top-of-mind issue.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard anybody in our industry talk about it or be concerned about it. People think the health authorities and the media are crying wolf, and they don't see it as a legitimate threat," Herbert said.</p>
<p>But Brownlee says with the recent avian flu scare and now H1N1, the possibility of a pandemic is real, and everyone should take it seriously.</p>
<p>"We are still pushing the message as much as we can to try and get businesses to prepare so that when there is a pandemic, the impact is minimal. At the end of the day, everybody has to use their Boy Scout theory: Be prepared."</p>
<p>Dean Karakasis, executive director of the Building Owners and Managers Association of Ottawa, couldn't agree more. His group represents people and companies that own or manage buildings across the city. Huge numbers of people live and work in their properties. Karakasis says that's why BOMA takes pandemic planning seriously.</p>
<p>The national body has sent out guidelines on how to deal with such an emergency and, locally, "webinars" have been held with the help of experts to map out what to do if a major outbreak occurs. He says the plans cover not only issues such as when and how to evacuate or shut down buildings, but the responsibilities of subcontractors who bring in security officers, cleaners and other workers.</p>
<p>"We take pandemic planning seriously and communication is a huge part of it," Karakasis said. "For us, it is about being prepared to help minimize the outbreak and help your tenants."</p>
<p>Business continuity planning has become an integral part of emergency readiness because in a flu pandemic, for instance, society's ability to function depends on the continued provision of key services -- from social and economic services to health and transportation. Without an able and willing workforce to pick up the slack, the effects of an emergency could be much worse.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada expects between 15 and 35 per cent of the workforce to be taken ill at any one time during a flu pandemic. Between 11,000 and 58,000 people are expected to die across the country. The agency says prudent planning requires businesses to plan for up to 50 per cent of their workers being absent for about two weeks at the height of a severe pandemic, which lasts about eight weeks.</p>
<p>While absenteeism is the key problem, businesses have to assume that materials needed to keep operations going may be disrupted, as will customer orders. Backup plans are vital to identify supply lines, determine how to fill orders and identify how to keep businesses staffed.</p>
<p>"Your business could be faced with extremely high absenteeism rates during a pandemic influenza. For this reason, your organization should plan ahead to ensure you can maintain service delivery during that time," the <span class="companylink">Business Development Bank of Canada</span> emphasized in a 2007 advisory to clients.</p>
<p>Considering Canada's reliance on trade, the bank estimates the Canadian economy could lose as much as $60 billion due to a pandemic outbreak. It could be more if the Canada-U.S. border is closed.</p>
<p>In a major emergency such as flu pandemic, the government has enormous powers to quarantine or relocate people, seize property or do any number of things in the name of the public good. But neither Levy, the city nor even the provincial and federal governments can force businesses and institutions to draw up emergency readiness plans. They can only advise that these plans be drawn up.</p>
<p>Experts say schools, colleges and universities are particularly vulnerable during a pandemic because they not only have large numbers of people congregated in relatively small places, but the H1N1 flu appears to be attacking young adults more aggressively than the flu typically does. Continuity plans are critical in dealing with sick students who live on campus, evacuating student housing or shutting down campuses, cancellation of classes, what courses could be taught online and where distance learning fits in. Even more critical is the loss and replacement of staff.</p>
<p>Area school boards, with responsibility for more than 120,000 students, are all at sea on the issue, with no pandemic readiness or business continuity plans of their own.</p>
<p>The good news is the city's colleges and universities are taking pandemic planning seriously.</p>
<p>"The biggest challenge for most universities is what is going to be the tipping point at which you decide you can no longer meet your fundamental objective of providing education," said Michael Histed, the University of Ottawa's director of risk management and the man responsible for pandemic planning there.</p>
<p>The university has 36,000 students, about 6,000 of whom reside on campus. Histed says one of the university's biggest concerns is the large number of young adults in the 17- to 22-year-old age group that appears to be vulnerable to H1N1. The university is working closely with similar institutions in the city and public health authorities to stay on top of the issue. He said the university will use the summer months to sharpen its focus on key areas identified by an emergency readiness committee. By the time students show up for the start of the academic year in September, the plan will be ready.</p>
<p>"We've been working on a business continuity plan for some time and we are now focusing specifically on issues like loss of staff, inability to provide teaching and handling large numbers of the population that are sick," Histed said.</p>
<p>Brian Burns, Algonquin College's director of institutional planning, says the college has had a business continuity plan in place for 18 months that covers student and staff safety. The college has more than 16,000 students, a little over 1,000 of whom reside on campus. Burns says Algonquin has a contract with a company to monitor and reach students in campus residences in the midst of a major flu pandemic. The system will help the college identify problem areas and get help there quickly.</p>
<p>"The plan covers the basic assumptions on which we are going to react in critical operations, and the duties of various departments and staff in the event of a pandemic," he said.</p>
<p>John Ash, the city's manager of emergency readiness, says it is better for businesses and organizations to be safe than sorry. "You may never need to activate your plan, but being prepared for any situation is as valuable as any form of insurance that protects your workplace."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Olympic projects available for Canadians in Russia, Day says</b>
</div><div>BILL CURRY </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Trade Minister Stockwell Day says there are big opportunities for Canadian construction firms winding down their Olympic projects to parlay their expertise into Russian contracts for the 2014 Winter Games.</p>
<p>Wrapping up a whirlwind trade mission through Asia, Europe and the Middle East, Mr. Day said his stop in Russia was a particularly successful leg of the trip.</p>
<p>“The Sochi Olympics offer a very positive opportunity,” said Mr. Day yesterday during a conference call from Jordan.</p>
<p>The minister said the Russian location of Sochi, a port city on the Black Sea, has a lot in common with the Canada's Olympic site.</p>
<p>“It has some similarities to Vancouver in that the Olympic village is right on the coast, literally by the water,” he said. “It's a very moderate climate, very warm in summer and moderate in winter, and then they proceed up into the mountains to their alpine event so they need rail and road. Even the company that is doing the drilling through the mountains and the tunnel there is a Canadian company. So we continue to pursue opportunities there.”</p>
<p>At least one Canadian firm is already playing a key role.</p>
<p>Canada's biggest engineering company, <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin Group Inc</span>., announced last week that it signed a deal to manage the construction and maintenance of roads and railways for the 2014 Games. It also announced that it has opened an office in Sochi.</p>
<p>“Construction is pretty much complete for our own Olympics,” said Mr. Day. “We have experience building in a variety of climates, great experience with Canadian companies building rail and road lines, so there's immediate potential there which we wanted to pursue and that trade mission was quite effective, a lot of positive contacts made and even some contracts signed.”</p>
<p>Russia has scaled back many of its infrastructure projects because of a big drop in private-sector investment as a result of the economic downturn. However reports indicate projects related to the Sochi Olympics have been given top priority.</p>
<p>Canada's Olympic preparations included a challenging $800-million expansion of the Sea-to-Sky Highway linking Vancouver and Whistler.</p>
<p>Mr. Day said he also expressed concern to Russian officials over their decision to block Canadian pork imports in response to the swine-flu outbreak. He said he believed he made some headway in the negotiations to re-open trade.</p>
<p>“They are going to give it a re-think. They haven't made the commitment about ‘drop the ban,' but certainly I raised it and I raised it in a forthright and frank manner,” he said. “They appreciate doing business like that in Russia. They like things on the table and straight.”</p>

<p>Re: Likely flu sufferer can't get test results, June 25.</p>
<p>In response to this article, I would like to clarify the reasons why we are moving away from testing of suspected cases of H1N1. I understand the concerns that the people of Ontario have for their health and for the health of their families during this pandemic.</p>
<p>Testing carried out to date has confirmed that the novel H1N1 influenza A virus is currently the predominant circulating strain of influenza in many communities. Once the virus is present in the community, testing all patients who present with influenza-like illness to confirm it is H1N1 does not influence whether treatment is offered.</p>
<p>More importantly, it is hindering the ability of the province's public health laboratory system to expedite the testing of hospitalized cases, those at risk of complications and suspected outbreaks.</p>
<p>This is why we are taking a new approach to surveillance. It will be more targeted, monitoring outbreaks and severe cases so we can learn more about the disease as it unfolds. This will help us guide the management of the pandemic as we move forward.</p>
<p>We also have issued guidelines to health-care providers regarding the management of influenza-like illnesses in this H1N1 flu pandemic, including the use of antivirals for early treatment, if needed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Montreal Blitz look to repeat North American championship; Women's Football Canada's only team grapples with injuries</b>
</div><div>DAVID YATES   </div>
<div>FREELANCE</div>
<div>765 words</div><div>29 June 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The only problem with winning a championship is that people expect you win again next year.</p>
<p>That's the challenge facing the Montreal Blitz, the team which won its first Tier II North American championship of the International Women's Football League last year in Chicago.</p>
<p>"We want to win again this year to prove last year was no fluke," said coach John Gibbon before the team's quarterfinal game against the Manchester Freedom yesterday at Dalbé-Viau High School in Lachine.</p>
<p>Gibbon and quarterback Saadia Ashraf feel the team, which ran up a respectable 5-3 record this season, faces tremendous odds in returning to the championship game July 25 in Texas as it grapples with a rash of injuries which have sidelined top players and the departure of others to indulge in altruistic ventures such as building houses in Africa.</p>
<p>For example, veteran runningback Georgina Paull has missed the whole season because of a torn ACL, while defensive-end Audrey Vallières has just returned to the team after a bout of swine flu developed into pneumonia. She and her family had to go into quarantine for 10 days.</p>
<p>Whether the fears about the playoffs are well founded is another matter.</p>
<p>The Blitz, which finished second in the Tier II standings, buried the Freedom 68-0 in their first playoff game Friday as receiver Geneviève Hardy scored four touchdowns including three on passes from Ashraf. She scored the fourth when she picked up a loose ball on the kickoff after one of her TD catches.</p>
<p>"I was surprised by the outcome of the game," said Ashraf, in her eighth season with the team and her fourth as owner.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen our best competition yet. We don't want to get lulled into thinking that it's going to be easy," she said. "The next round will be a lot tougher."</p>
<p>Gibbon also expressed surprise after the Blitz took control of the game in the second quarter, scoring six touch downs and finishing the first half with a lead of 48-0.</p>
<p>"I thought it would be a lot tougher, but we're starting to come together as a team," he said, paying particular tribute to Joey Kluzac who took over as offensive coordinator after the beginning of the season.</p>
<p>Vallières, who is the oldest player on the team at the age of 37, admitted she felt weak after the game.</p>
<p>She still has a deep chest cough, but she said her case was no different from other players who went into the game with injuries.</p>
<p>For Vallières, the lure of the contact on the field was too much to resist. The aggressive and violent nature of tackle football is what draws her to the game.</p>
<p>"I like to be part of the team because I can release all that aggressivity," said Vallières, who relishes the chance to hit players on the opposing teams.</p>
<p>"I love her because she always has a big smile after she makes a hit," coach Gibbon said.</p>
<p>A former hockey player (Université Laval 1990-91), Vallières, in her third year on the Blitz, said she likes football better because of the hitting which is not allowed under women's rules for hockey.</p>
<p>The football attitude has been tempered by her age.</p>
<p>"I have to work harder to catch up because the players are younger," she said.</p>
<p>"But I keep learning the techniques because I have the chance to learn from a lot of good coaches. They make you understand what you have to do," said the mother of 12-year-old Gabrielle. Vallières is a buyer for <span class="companylink">Bombardier Inc</span>.</p>
<p>She's well aware of the challenge the team faces in the playoffs.</p>
<p>"We have a lot of new girls and they have had to learn really fast," Vallières said. "We don't have the same core of players that we had last year."</p>
<p>A new face on the Blitz is that of linebacker Jenn Deguise who is in her first year on the team.</p>
<p>"It's really fun," said Deguise who ran back an interception for a touchdown in the first game of the season.</p>
<p>If the Blitz gets back to the championship game, the team will face a little more adversity. Receiver Hardy will be missing because she'll be on a trip climbing Mount Kilimanjaro.</p>

<p>On Saturday, June 27, people were making fun of Police Chief Mike Boyd.</p>
<p>Our Supreme Court upheld a law that denied a teenager the right to refuse a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>In Montreal, police raids are being put under a microscope.</p>

<p>And there's another suspected death from swine flu in Manitoba.</p>
<p>In the United States, a bill has just been passed by the House of Representatives that will allow big companies to pay for the right to pollute our atmosphere. Those companies will then increase the costs of goods and services they sell to you, me and everyone else to offset those payments,</p>
<p>The president of Iran is now screaming back at U. S. President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>While this and more is happening worldwide, all we are reading about and seeing is the death of a pop singer. CBC and CNN went bonkers, with unending chatter and still continues.

<p>Re: Summer camps brace to battle the flu, June 21.</p>
<p>The recent concerns about the H1N1 virus are something the National Capital Region YMCA-YWCA has taken very seriously. We have taken a number of steps across the board, including a heightened awareness and increased prevention protocols at our camps, fitness facilities, child- care and housing services.</p>
<p>As an accredited camp with the Ontario Camping Association and YMCA Canada, we abide by all health, wellness and safety guidelines. The health and safety of our campers is always a priority and this year is no different.</p>
<p>This said, we are taking extra precautions this camp season in light of the risk of H1N1 spreading and we hope other camps are doing the same.</p>
<p>In addition to our already vigilant health and pandemic protocols, including educating families, campers and our staff about early identification and prevention, regular health checks, reducing hand-to-hand contact, encouraging hand-washing and coughing etiquette, and having doctors on call, we have taken a number of steps to ensure our campers have a safe and happy summer.</p>
<p>We have added specialized staff training by local public health units to educate our team on early detection and prevention, increased family and camper knowledge about the symptoms and encouraged them to keep sick children at home.</p>
<p>We have also increased prevention protocols like mandatory hand-washing and hand checks before entering the dining area.</p>
<p>With a heightened sense of awareness and the proper protocols in place this season, camp will continue to be as much a part of childhood as it has in years past.</p>

<p>The following editorial is from the Edmonton Journal.</p>
<p>Canadians have been assured by the federal government that its $1-billion Pandemic Influenza Plan was in place and ready to be quickly implemented if necessary. First Nations residents in remote Manitoba communities, where an H1N1 eruption is spreading, must be wondering just what Ottawa's definition of "rapid response" might be.</p>
<p>Poor, isolated northern communities plagued by water quality and sanitation issues are at particular risk during epidemics, and moving with dispatch is key. That hasn't happened in this case, and Canadians all over the country might well wonder if the declarations of preparedness and professionalism we've been handed have much validity when the most at risk among us have been given such short shrift. The mind boggles with intimations of bureaucratic dithering over whether sending alcohol-based hand sanitizer gel to "dry" communities was appropriate. Speedily protecting the majority in places with dicey water supplies should have trumped the sad proclivities of the hopelessly addicted. Frankly, that's another massive problem, but not this one.</p>
<p>In the end, it all boils down to the paternalism directly built into the Indian Act. Incidents like this serve to underline the pressing need to update the relationship between Canada's First Nations and the rest of the country. The current construction is ancient, unworkable and increasingly unfit for the times.</p>

</p>
<p>On June 24, 2009, the executive council of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs authorized me as grand chief to declare a state of emergency over the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>When a government declares a state of emergency, it means that normal government functions may be suspended, citizens will be alerted and emergency plans must be implemented. That allows federal government money that is already earmarked for other purposes to be diverted to fight the pandemic.</p>
<p>By declaring a state of emergency, we, the chiefs, are demanding that the federal government take more aggressive action in addressing this crisis in our communities.</p>
<p>As many people have heard in the media, the federal government delayed shipping hand sanitizer to our communities for a month while it debated whether to allow us the alcohol-based product. The federal government's slow response to the H1N1 pandemic in our communities is being condemned not only all over the country, but internationally as well.</p>
<p>A UNICEF report issued Wednesday points out that one in four First Nation children in Canada live in poverty. The World Health Organization has pointed out a link between poverty and the severity of H1N1.</p>
<p>As First Nation leaders, we have been warning federal health ministers for years about the need to prepare for a pandemic of this kind.</p>
<p>In October 2006, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs (AMC) task force on health and I met with the then-federal minister of health, Tony Clement, requesting funding to participate in pandemic flu planning activities that were being done by other levels of government.</p>
<p>In March 2008, the AMC hosted a three-day pandemic planning and preparedness conference that included all three levels of government, but federal funding for our pandemic co-ordinator at AMC ended in March 2009.</p>
<p>A month later, H1N1 hit.</p>
<p>First Nations leaders have joined together to address this emergency situation: the AMC, which represents all 64 First Nations in Manitoba, the Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) which represents the North, and the Southern Chiefs Organization (SCO) are working together to provide information to communities, create criticalincident teams in each community and to ensure that all levels of government are communicating properly.</p>
<p>Posters are being sent to each community with advice on how to protect yourself from the flu: Wash your hands (soap and water is best, but sanitizers will do), cough into your sleeve, avoid touching your face and stay away from public events, particularly if you are feeling unwell.</p>
<p>Finally, health representatives from every community are being trained to set up critical incident command centres in each First Nation.</p>
<p>But all of these efforts cannot stop the H1N1 virus seriously harming our people without the support of all levels of government. By declaring a state of emergency, we are demanding that the federal department of Indian Affairs and First Nation Inuit health branch, as well as the provincial health department, meet with us immediately to make concrete plans for a possible second wave of the virus in September.</p>
<p>We also cannot let them lose sight of the fact that poverty, extreme overcrowding, lack of running water, high rates of chronic diseases and the remoteness of many First Nations are significant contributing factors that elevate the risk.</p>
<p>I want to thank all of the chiefs and other First Nation leaders of Manitoba for coming together in this crisis situation and realizing it's about the people, not the politics.</p>
<p>Ron Evans is Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.</p>

<p>77There's no coughing, no TVs blaring. The patients are in isolation rooms behind glass, on ventilators, hooked up to monitors and feeding tubes -- and heavily sedated.</p>
<p>If they were wide awake, they'd feel as if they were drowning.</p>
<p>"For many patients, it's a very terrible sensation," says the chief medical officer at Health Sciences Centre, Dr. Perry Gray.</p>
<p>Welcome to the front lines of the battle against the H1N1 virus in Manitoba.</p>
<p>The hardest-hit victims of the virus -- the "ICU flu" -- are in isolation at the Health Sciences Centre and St. Boniface General Hospital intensive care units with tubes down their throats, sick as hell and struggling to get enough oxygen.</p>
<p>The flu has damaged their lungs and they need help to breathe. For one woman, it has also damaged her kidneys. She's hooked up to a dialysis machine 24-7, heavily sedated and unaware.</p>
<p>The medical intensive care unit is chockablock at HSC, with close to all of the rooms occupied.</p>
<p>"It's pretty overwhelming," Dr. Brian Postl forewarned a first-time visitor. The head of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority didn't exaggerate.</p>
<p>With tubes down their throats and machines helping them breathe, it's hard to reconcile the fact that what's made these 20-to-50-somethings so deathly ill is the flu.</p>
<p>It's hit them in their prime, these patients -- "all of whom look close to dying, and, the fact of the matter is, some are," said Postl.</p>
<p>Two adults have died from H1N1 virus in Manitoba, both middle-aged. Only one of them had an underlying health condition.</p>
<p>In the pediatric intensive care unit, a child died Wednesday.</p>
<p>All of the patients under 18 with H1N1 had risk factors that made them more susceptible to getting sick.</p>
<p>There are 20 suspected or confirmed cases of H1N1 at Children's Hospital and another five in the pediatric intensive care unit at HSC. The kids -- ranging from toddlers to teens -- are behind glass, heavily sedated and on ventilators like the adults. Unlike the adults, all of them already had risk factors or pre-existing conditions before getting the flu.</p>
<p>"We are not seeing healthy kids," said Dr. Murray Kesselman, head of the pediatric ICU. "What's different is the number of kids at one time with this severity" of the flu.</p>
<p>The concerns of parents of H1N1 kids are the same as with any other critical illness, said Kesselman: "Will my child be all right? Why is this happening to me?"</p>
<p>Just outside the ICU, the parents of a tow-headed toddler on a respirator say they took their coughing baby -- who had a pre-existing condition -- twice to the emergency department and were sent home. One of those trips was by ambulance.</p>
<p>When the respirologist finally saw their 16-month-old daughter, he admitted her right away. "We knew something was wrong," he dad said.</p>
<p>They agreed to have their daughter's photo taken, but do not want their names made public.</p>
<p>Her father has some advice for parents sure their child is very sick: "You know your child. Trust your instincts."</p>
<p>They said she's getting excellent care in the pediatric intensive care unit.</p>
<p>"She's heading in the right direction," her dad said. But they're frustrated that it took so long to get her there.</p>
<p>"Everyone's overloaded."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Typically, as many as 3,000 Canadians die from the flu every year.</p>
<p>What's different with the H1N1 virus is it affects more young people and makes them sicker and for a longer time.</p>
<p>And rather than hitting hard in the winter, this flu is affecting people in the summer when flu is supposed to be on a bit of hiatus thanks to more people being at home or outdoors rather than in classrooms and offices where viruses are easily shared.</p>
<p>The flu victims are watched around the clock by staff shrouded in protective gear and running at full tilt to keep ahead of the virus. It arrived in full force at the busiest time for the ICU: the summer, or "trauma season" in Manitoba.</p>
<p>"There are more people on the road and more accidents and the 'knife and gun club' is usually more active," said Dr. Perry Gray, vice-president, chief medical officer and head of the surgical intensive care unit at the HSC.</p>
<p>Normally, there are 30 adult patients on ventilators in the summer. This week, before summer is even in full swing, there were 55.</p>
<p>The isolation rooms in the medical ICU are nearly full of patients, most of whom appear to be aboriginal.</p>
<p>Medical residents make their rounds with a dietitian and a pharmacist. The attending physician and nurse update them on each patient's progress or lack thereof. The medical ICU has two attending physicians sharing 24-hour shifts on a seven-day cycle. The two doctors take turns so they can get a night off and not be disturbed every second night.</p>
<p>In the medical intensive care unit, Gray scans the bed board which shows the availability of beds in departments and other hospitals in the city. Changes are faxed in daily.</p>
<p>"This is the place where most of the province calls from outside Winnipeg," said Gray.</p>
<p>If a patient needs to be brought to the city from up north, they can scan the board and see what's available and where the patient should go.</p>
<p>"We know where the beds are," he said. It's a simple device that's been in use for the last 10 years, but with a long, hot summer of trauma on top of H1N1 "it's an effective way to manage in a flu outbreak," said Gray.</p>
<p>This past week, the HSC medical intensive care unit was at 80 per cent capacity and the pediatric intensive care unit at 75 per cent.</p>
<p>Kesselman said the pediatric ICU -- the only one in the province -- is busy even when there isn't a flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"We're very near at capacity," he said. "Everything else still goes on, the illnesses, the accidents."</p>
<p>Now the ICU beds are mostly occupied with H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>"With the help of the nursing staff, we're able to manage," he said.</p>
<p>Pediatric ICU nurse Ben Wiebe is focused on his patient behind the glass, a dark-haired toddler lying on her front with her eyes closed.</p>
<p>"We're watching her pretty closely," Wiebe said Wednesday morning, monitoring the machines. "She was pretty sick yesterday."</p>
<p>Nurses turned her from her back to her front, he said, and that seemed to help. Several nurses worked together to turn the tiny girl over because of all the tubes and equipment connected to her.</p>
<p>When it's time to go into her sterile environment to check her blood and examine her, Wiebe suits up in mask, gloves, gown and eye shield. It's not a time to cuddle.</p>
<p>The children are lying still and alone surrounded by machines for their own good.</p>
<p>"Often, hands off is better," said Wiebe. "It's better to keep them sedate and calm. The smallest bit of stimulus can cause them to be agitated." The toddler's body needs to use energy and oxygen to get better, not to squirm and fuss.</p>
<p>The father of two said he thinks about his own kids' health during his 12-hour shift.</p>
<p>"It's straight into the shower before I do anything when I get home," said Wiebe. "You've got to protect yourself and your family."</p>
<p>Nurse Maria Dobrostal's patient is a little older and less sedated. Her eyes open from time to time and she moves her legs around.</p>
<p>"She gets sad sometimes," said Dobrostal, suiting up every hour to go in and check on her young patient.</p>
<p>"We'll talk to her and comfort her," said Dobrostal, who has no kids of her own. "They calm down."</p>
<p>Nearby, Kesselman explains why a tiny patient's chest is moving up and down so quickly. Her ventilator is pumping 300 shallow breaths a minute into her little lungs.</p>
<p>"It's so the lung doesn't get stretched. It can rest, and it gives it time to heal," he said. "If the lung is so injured and so damaged," inflating it can hurt more.</p>
<p>For the very young, there is hope for healing.</p>
<p>"Lungs can make a remarkable recovery," said Kesselman.</p>
<p>People are the key to coping with the severe flu outbreak, said the HSC's chief medical officer.</p>
<p>"Our biggest issue is not the beds -- it's the staffing," said Gray.</p>
<p>"We're pretty well stocked with the equipment we need," Postl said. They have three million disposable safety masks and 20 new ventilators on hand.</p>
<p>"The issues are staff. We need to free up as many staff as we can," he said, applauding the people who've stepped up.</p>
<p>"The staff are doing a remarkable job taking care of patients, (but) they're tired, and they're stretched."</p>
<p>Nurses bear the brunt of the staffing demands presented by the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Some have been taken from their regular Monday-to-Friday jobs and are working 12-hour shifts and mandatory overtime.</p>
<p>"I'm not a bedside nurse," said Maurita Kiesman in the medical ICU. Normally, she's a critical care nursing educator who works weekdays.</p>
<p>"I'm now deployed to work here nights and weekends," said Kiesman, who stressed she wasn't complaining.</p>
<p>"I have said I'm ready and willing to help these units," she said. "It's been good to be hands-on again in a different role." Fortunately, her husband's a teacher who will soon be off work and able to care for their kids while she's pulling 12-hour shifts.</p>
<p>Article 10 of the Manitoba Nurses Union agreement gives hospitals in emergencies or strikes the power to schedule nurses to work when and where they are needed.</p>
<p>The hospitals have used Article 10 to increase staffing during the H1N1 outbreak, and it's turning some nurses' lives upside down. And no one knows how long that will last.</p>
<p>The extra shifts have been especially hard on nurses with young families, like Kari in pediatric emergency.</p>
<p>"We aren't staffed very well. We're working double shifts and getting called in on our days off," Kari said.</p>
<p>She didn't want her last name published. Her husband is a police officer, and they both work shifts. Juggling child care and stressful jobs takes a toll.</p>
<p>"People aren't patient," said the children's ER nurse. "Everyone thinks their child is going to die."</p>
<p>Kari welcomed a rare lull in the department Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We're getting to eat today. Awesome," she deadpanned. Kari didn't know Wednesday that the HSC is adding three full-time equivalent nursing positions in her department.</p>
<p>"A week ago, it was crazy here," said psychiatric nurse June Galaugher in children's emergency.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus isn't just frightening parents, Galaugher said.</p>
<p>The sight of staff in protective masks, goggles and gowns was scaring some of the little kids, said Galaugher. "Everyone was walking around like aliens."</p>
<p>Up in the medical intensive care unit with the adults, nursing veteran Bif Cohoe takes the extra work in stride.</p>
<p>"We're all working a lot of OT," said the 30-year ICU nurse.</p>
<p>The disposable safety masks are really starting to grate, she said.</p>
<p>"Try wearing this for 12 hours a day," she said, handing visitors a couple of notorious N95s to try on. The metal plate inside the top of mask presses against the nose and the bottom fits tight over the chin, almost like a muzzle.</p>
<p>The day-to-day details of dealing with H1N1 may not be a life-or-death matter, but they add to the stress. Instead of a few dozen neatly folded yellow gowns in a supply closet, there are hundreds, clean but rolled-up, piled ceiling-high in a cart in the hallway. Unit assistant Carmencita Reyes tries to manage the mountain, pulling a few from the pile and folding them.</p>
<p>"We need hundreds and hundreds of these things," Reyes said.</p>
<p>The masking and the gowning are a constant pain, for nurses and visitors and everyone.</p>
<p>"It could be worse," said Cohoe.</p>
<p>And it may get worse. A jump in the number of H1N1 cases is anticipated in the fall. The HSC has a number of contingency plans in place to deal with a surge in flu. They can convert the old HSC emergency room, now the neurological clinic, either back to an ER or to a flu clinic to treat more patients and administer an H1N1 vaccine -- if one is developed.</p>
<p>The trick is to be flexible, said Adam Topp, HSC chief operating officer. He said officials originally planned for a flu clinic to handle an anticipated swell in people being hospitalized. The flu ended up leaving people sick at home in bed or extremely ill in the ICU -- with no patients in the middle. The flu clinic was shelved.</p>
<p>Officials have prepared a "step-down unit" in the former intensive care unit at HSC. It's for patients who are getting better but are not yet well enough to be on a ward and might still be infectious.</p>
<p>Some semi-private hospital rooms have been converted to private rooms for H1N1 patients who need to be hospitalized but are well enough to use a call button. Instead of being behind glass where staff can keep an eye on them, they're behind closed doors until they're well enough to leave.</p>
<p>If there is an onslaught of serious flu this fall, the hospital could use the new ER for flu patients and divert emergency patients to the old ER.</p>
<p>For now, its business as usual -- sort of.</p>
<p>On the front lines of the emergency department, things have quieted down after media reports of the first two H1N1 deaths sent a flurry of people to the ER fearing they had the flu.</p>
<p>Patients are greeted at the entrance by a stop sign and a community support worker who quizzes everyone about their health. If patients have flu symptoms, they put on a mask.</p>
<p>Everyone coming in the door has to sanitize their hands -- "even if they're just delivering an envelope," said Laverne Sturtevant, in charge of patient service in the ER.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Gray said the trouble with H1N1 is you're just kind of sick or very, very sick. And someone can get very sick quickly.</p>
<p>He can't comment on individual patient cases, but said, as a general rule, someone who knows a patients can make a better call.</p>
<p>"If you know what someone normally looks like, you're better able to (determine) when they're not right."</p>
<p>"You have to be on guard," Gray said. "It's subtle things, the heart racing a little faster," he said, ticking off a list of symptoms.</p>
<p>"Being right 95 per cent of the time is not good enough," he said.</p>
<p>Editor's note: HSC officials said Friday they are reviewing the case of the 16-month-old baby girl who was twice turned away from the emergency room.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Camps guard against swine flu; Parents asked to keep kids at home if they've been exposed to bugs</b>
</div><div>Matthew Pearson </div>

</p>
<p>Children packing their bags for summer camp are being asked to leave one thing at home -- swine flu.</p>
<p>As the number of confirmed cases of H1N1 virus continues to rise in B.C., camps could soon become the newest battleground in the pandemic that has already claimed 21 Canadians.</p>
<p>The B.C. Camping Association is asking parents to come clean about their children's health. Parents should talk to camp directors before dropping children off at camp if kids have been exposed to any contagious diseases just prior to arrival.</p>
<p>"We need collaboration from families to make summer camps a safe place," said Hartley Banack, president of the association, which represents 68 accredited summer camps in B.C., serving roughly 14,000 campers each year. Each camp must meet standards spelled out in a 49-page accreditation guide on the association's website.</p>
<p>At Strathcona Park Lodge and Outdoor</p>
<p>Education Centre, west of Campbell River, staff have installed additional handwashing stations and are taking extra screening precautions with arriving campers, said executive director Jamie Boulding.</p>
<p>But, he added, safe hygiene practices have been top of mind for the past few years at summer camps such as his, since dealing with a sick camper while out in the bush can be onerous and disruptive. "It's actually a real pain to have a sick kid," he said.</p>
<p>Boulding said his local health authority wants to be notified as soon as two campers come down with flu symptoms at the same time. "Everyone's being careful, which is a good thing," he said.</p>
<p>Banack, who serves as director of three Easter Seals camps for children with physical or mental disabilities, including one at Shawnigan Lake, said the screening process at the camps is much stricter because some of the campers have compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>Every camper must visit a physician before attending camp and undergo a thorough check-in with camp staff. Easter Seals camps also have registered nurses and nursing students on site.</p>
<p>In Ontario, the provincial camping association has urged its members to report to public-health officials when they see three or more cases of the flu within a four-day period. While the same rule isn't in place in B.C., Banack said accredited camps must report all major incidents to the provincial body.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it's "business as usual" at the YM-YWCA of Victoria as it gears up for summer day camps.</p>
<p>Camp co-ordinator Mark Sheppard said he expects more than 300 campers at two locations over this</p>
<p>summer, but added the Y has not taken additional precautions this year to curb the spread of flu.</p>
<p>"It didn't really come up in our planning," he said. "We make it very clear if [campers] had any sort of flu that we need to know."</p>
<p>B.C.'s Ministry of Health reported Friday there have been 21 new cases of swine flu in B.C. since June 24, including four on Vancouver Island.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sanitizing politics</b>

<p>This editorial appeared in the Ottawa Citizen</p>
<p>The threat of H1N1 on reserves is very real. If there's any hope of preventing a serious health crisis in Canada's aboriginal communities, it lies with quick preventive action.</p>
<p>So the fact that Health Canada delayed the deployment of hand sanitizers to reserves, because of concerns over their alcohol content, is worrying.</p>
<p>It is not racist to raise the question of whether alcohol-based sanitizers could have unintended consequences. Alcoholism is a scourge on some reserves. Of course, that does not mean that every aboriginal person is an alcoholic. Withholding hand sanitizers during an epidemic because of a fear of alcohol abuse is, essentially, punishing all aboriginal people for the addictions of some.</p>
<p>It is also paternalistic, especially when it comes from the federal government rather than from aboriginal leaders themselves. It's also a bit rich, given that the federal government is responsible for the lack of clean water on reserves. It's the government's fault that handwashing is difficult; the least the feds can do is provide an alternative.</p>
<p>Fighting addiction to alcohol or drugs by cutting off supply is always a losing strategy, anyway.</p>
<p>The health and infrastructure problems on reserves can't be solved by withholding hand sanitizer --or by wasting time arguing about it.</p>

</p>
<p>A visitor dropped by my office the other day for a chat and a cup of lemon tea. We talked about the latest in aboriginal politics, and then about Malcolm Gladwell -- the author of Outliers: The Story of Success.</p>
<p>Gladwell is a journalist who writes for the New Yorker and has a few bestselling books that mix research with thoughtful conclusions. An outlier is something or someone who is an anomaly, operating outside the normal standards set for them.</p>
<p>People like Barack Obama, Bill Gates and the Beatles are outliers. Gladwell says he's an outlier too. One idea Gladwell presents in the book that got a lot of attention is the "10,000 hour rule."</p>
<p>Some researchers found 10,000 hours of practice is all that stands in your way of becoming an expert at something. Maybe you want to be the next Tiger Woods, Mozart or Norval Morrisseau?</p>
<p>Well, looking at it from a scientific point of view, all it's going to take is practicing hard for 10,000 hours. Well, actually there's more to it. Gladwell says success is also a group effort. It really does take a village to raise a child.</p>
<p>Gladwell also talks about innate talent, and the role of culture. Parents and relatives must support the child if they're to overcome any obstacles, as well as find time to practice.</p>
<p>According to the book, if you want to be a big success you must work harder than your peers, see things others can't see, and find a good fit between your cultural legacy and what you choose to practice.</p>
<p>Now what does this mean for aboriginal people?</p>
<p>It means a child growing up on a reserve in northern Manitoba right now could decide today to become a world-class athlete. That child would have to train for 10,000 hours to eventually make it to the Olympics. As long as they work hard and have supporters along the way, it can be done.</p>
<p>In fact, we already have quite a few aboriginal Olympic athletes - Tom Longboat, Waneek Horn-Miller, Alwyn Morris and Angela Chalmers to name a few.</p>
<p>Theories like this do make you optimistic: We can achieve anything we want with hard work, the help of our families, and dedication.</p>
<p>But then again, 10,000 hours of work doesn't always mean success.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the federal government. Now they've been working with us for a lot longer than those 10,000 hours of practice. Maybe 100,000 hours? That's a modest estimate.</p>
<p>We're supposed to work together to help fix the problems that plague many aboriginal communities: there's not enough housing, education funding, and opportunities on reserve. Then there's the legacy of residential schools in the form of violence, abuse and family dysfunction.</p>
<p>And now we've got this H1N1 virus set to devastate communities further. We've got communities that have had medical supplies delayed because of some bureaucratic fear that someone's going to get drunk off alcohol-based sanitizer. Apparently this is a bigger fear than that of people spreading the virus and dying.</p>
<p>Is this part of some plan to deal with a pandemic that comes from tens of thousands of hours of practice? Is this the best the federal outliers can do?</p>
<p>Maybe it takes a lot more time to get it right.</p>

<p>Josh Dugard may have ventured no farther north than Algonquin Park before, but in less than two weeks the young nurse will be heading to the remote reaches of northern Manitoba and into the middle of a medical state of emergency.</p>
<p>"It's a great opportunity, but I have no idea what to expect," says Dugard, who found out Thursday he'll be going to Poplar River, 400 kilometres north of Winnipeg, as part of a program at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>He's one of six graduating nursing students heading to three northern Manitoba Indian reserves a week Monday for six weeks to provide much-needed help at the communities' busy medical stations.</p>
<p>Manitoba aboriginal leaders have declared a state of emergency because of H1N1 flu, and called on the federal and provincial governments to do the same.</p>
<p>"There needs to be an organized plan," said Ron Evans, Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. "Someone needs to be responsible. Right now, no one wants to accept responsibility for the First Nations."</p>
<p>While aboriginal people make up a little more than 10 per cent of Manitoba's population, they account for two-thirds of those needing intensive care for H1N1 flu, according to provincial health officials. Provincial Health Minister Theresa Oswald said the province has been acting in a situation akin to a state of emergency since April.</p>
<p>Health Canada has said it may have to close several nursing stations and medical centres in northern Manitoba if it can't find nurses to staff them.</p>
<p>Students can usually expect to find out by the end of May which Manitoba reserves they will be going to, but the flu outbreak made that impossible this year, said Amy Bender, coordinator of placement program at the university.</p>
<p>"We've had some trouble confirming placements," Bender said.</p>
<p>Besides Poplar River, with a population of about 1,000, students will be going to Pukatawagan and Garden Hill, where public events have been cancelled to slow the spread of the flu. Both communities are even farther north than Dugard's destination.</p>
<p>"Most of the First Nations that are in Manitoba are not even prepared. They don't even have sanitizers," said Chief David Harper of the Garden Hill First Nation.</p>
<p>Bender said the prevalence of swine flu in native communities in northern Manitoba complicated planning this year. Because their six-week placements are considered part of their course work, the novice nurses require supervision and monitoring during their postings.</p>
<p>The unfortunate irony, she said, is that with the flu so widespread, many of the hardest-hit communities were unable to accept the students, despite needing all the help they could get.</p>
<p>"It's a very sad situation," she said, but may be unavoidable.</p>
<p>Ivana Matic, who took part in the placement program last year, said infectious diseases spread quickly in the remote communities, where people live in close proximity in sub-standard housing.</p>
<p>"They are ideal breeding grounds," said Matic, who spent six weeks in Cross Lake, 500 kilometres north of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Inspired by her time in Cross Lake, Matic is now working on her master's degree in nursing, with a focus on native health issues. Besides swine flu, Matic said the communities face a number of serious health concerns related to living conditions.</p>
<p>"These are Third World conditions," said Matic. "I never thought I would see that in Canada."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Now he can be at rest'; Parents of teen who died from swine flu grateful suffering over for boy who was a fighter all his life</b>
</div><div>Bruce Deachman </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1127 words</div><div>27 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Hans Wytenburg and Laurie Jeffrey each carefully measure their response to the question: Is the death of your son a relief? "Honestly," says Hans. "I think it's better for him.</p>
<p>"Now he can be at rest, and he doesn't have to go through the pain and the rest of what would happen to him as he gets older." The important thing, Laurie adds, is that he's no longer suffering, and that he was allowed to die with dignity, something the couple had been fighting for ever since James was born.</p>
<p>James Jeffrey Wytenburg, 17, died early Tuesday morning at CHEO, his existing respiratory problems complicated by the H1N1 virus. He was the first teenager in Eastern Ontario to die from swine flu, and the second area resident.</p>
<p>He had been a fighter all his life, says Laurie, and had the scars of dozens of operations to prove it. But when she got a call a week ago Friday from his caregiver, telling her that she'd had to take James to CHEO with respiratory problems, Laurie recalled what doctors had told her when he was an infant: that one day, a virus would likely overwhelm you son's system, and he would die of respiratory failure.</p>
<p>"They said 'It will be a respiratory bug that finishes him off'," Laurie remembers.</p>
<p>When James -- the first of Hans and Laurie's five children -- was born on March 28, 1992, in a small rural hospital near Ottawa, his brain was deprived of oxygen for 30 minutes. Rushed to intensive care at CHEO, he was not expected to survive to the next day, and then not to the next week, the next month.</p>
<p>And while most of his organs recovered from the oxygen deprivation, his brain was significantly and irreversibly damaged. He eyes moved, but he couldn't see. The only sounds he could process were high-pitched ones, and they distressed him. He couldn't eat or drink, nor move his arms or legs with any control.</p>
<p>"He sometimes would just turn and stare into the sun," recalls Laurie, a veterinarian who lives with Hans, a farmer, and James's four siblings on a farm in Foresters Falls, near Cobden.</p>
<p>"Mentally," explains Hans, "he was not there." When James's problems became apparent, his parents requested that in the event extraordinary measures were needed to save his life, he not be resuscitated; that he be allowed to die with dignity.</p>
<p>James was placed in a home where he would receive round-the-clock care and be in the company of other children with special needs.</p>
<p>"Everything he needed," says Hans, "they had to do for him.</p>
<p>"That was his family. We are his parents, but as far as his life was concerned, that's his family -- he's been with them so long. They're very loving and caring, and treat him probably better than a lot of people treat their own kids." James's parents' wishes that he be allowed to die without intervention did not sit well with many people, especially when they voiced their sympathies, when James was two, for Robert Latimer, the Saskatchewan farmer convicted of second-degree murder in the death of his 12-year-old daughter Tracy, who suffered cerebral palsy.</p>
<p>"I can very well understand why he did what he did," recalls Hans. "Unless you have stood in our shoes, or Mr. Latimer's shoes or anyone's who's been in that situation, I would say most people have no idea what it's like.</p>
<p>"I'm from the old school," he adds. "I would not allow my dog to live like they made (James) live.</p>
<p>"I live on a farm. I grew up on a farm. If somebody saw me treat animals like that, I would be in jail. But because he's a human being, they try to make sure he doesn't die." Along the way, Hans and Laurie had their share of battles with such organizations as the Children's Aid Society, groups they felt did not have James's best interests at heart.</p>
<p>Unable to see or hear, or do much, in fact, beyond sit in a specially fitted wheelchair, James was enrolled in school, a move Hans found "insane." "He was there because this ridiculous government figured that putting totally challenged children in the classroom environment would make people aware of what the other side of life was like.</p>
<p>"There are times in this world," he adds, "where you have to just accept what's going on and face reality." n n n A week ago Friday, when she received the phone call from James's caregiver at CHEO, Laurie returned to the hospital to say goodbye.</p>
<p>At the time, she was unaware that the H1N1 virus was involved -- Laurie says now that one of the other children at the home where James lived came in contact with it at school. All the children there tested positive for H1N1, she says, as did the caregiver. All have since been treated.</p>
<p>And Laurie and Hans are thankful that James was finally allowed to die without intervention.</p>
<p>"It happened very fast," she says. "On Sunday he was still doing OK. His breathing was bad, it was hurting him. He was getting bad and I didn't think he'd be leaving." She admits she was worried, though, that there might yet be interference from an outside person or group.</p>
<p>She took one of her daughters with her Monday night to say goodbye to James, and was planning to take the other kids the next day.</p>
<p>"I figured it could be a few days, I figured it could be a few weeks," she says. "He'd always recovered before, but I felt this was the last time." It came faster than she knew. On Monday, now in palliative care, James's hook-ups and monitors were removed and he was given morphine to ease his pain. He was, his mother says, finally at peace.</p>
<p>"To carry on life when there wasn't a lot of quality of life ... I would not want to live in a bed all my life and not be able to see or hear or appreciate anything around me. But it was mainly that he was not suffering."</p>

</div><div>AARON DERFEL </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>527 words</div><div>27 June 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette </div>
</p>
<p>As Quebec reported its 12th swine flu death yesterday, some hospitals in the Montreal region have decided to bar visitors under age 18.</p>
<p>The restrictions have been imposed at Ste. Justine and Maisonneuve-Rosemont hospitals and the McGill University Health Centre in Montreal; and at Cité de La Santé and five government-run nursing homes in Laval.</p>
<p>"The under-18 age group is the most at risk of catching the H1N1 virus, and so we are limiting visits to the parents of children who have been hospitalized," said Mélanie Dallaire, a spokesperson for Ste. Justine.</p>
<p>"Since our patients are already sick, we don't want to run the risk of exposing them to the virus."</p>
<p>The Montreal Children's Hospital has decided not to restrict visitors, although it has posted a security guard at its entrance to make sure that people who enter the building wash their hands with an alcohol-based sanitizer.</p>
<p>The Centre hospitalier de l'université de Montréal is also allowing those under 18 to visit patients at its hospitals.</p>
<p>H1N1 has proved distinctive in two respects: Many cases are being reported on a daily basis even during the summer (when infections of the typical flu are rare), and many young people are getting sick.</p>
<p>Government statistics show that 33 per cent of all cases in Quebec are in the 10- to 19-year-old age group - the highest of any demographic. The next group hit hardest are those ages 20 to 29 (17 per cent of all cases), followed by people in the 40- to 49-year-old range (12 per cent of cases).</p>
<p>Public-health officials said a woman in her 60s died yesterday from H1N1. The victim was from the Quebec City region had been suffering from some medical problems.</p>
<p>The province reported 39 new cases yesterday, raising the total number of swine-flu infections to 1,873 since the end of April. Authorities acknowledge that many more Quebecers have contracted H1N1 but just haven't shown up at a hospital.</p>
<p>Dallaire said Ste. Justine has noticed an increase in the number of hospitalizations related to H1N1, but she couldn't provide any numbers. The hospital usually closes some beds during the summer, but that isn't the case this year because of the swine flu, she added.</p>
<p>Globally, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 59,814 cases to date. Out of that number, there have been 263 deaths. That's a mortality rate of four-tenths of one per cent.</p>
<p>By contrast, a seasonal flu strain has a mortality rate of one-tenth of one per cent. In the first month of the H1N1 pandemic, the mortality rate appeared to be in line with the seasonal flu, but has since increased steadily as the number of cases spread worldwide.</p>
<p>Historically, however, a mild flu pandemic is considered to have a mortality rate of one-half per cent. Thus, H1N1 is still considered mild.</p>

</div><div>KAREN SEIDMAN </div>

</p>
<p>Before the first day of camp was even over at the Y Country Camp in the Laurentians on Wednesday, one child had to be sent home with a suspected case of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Camp director Sid Milech is hoping it's an isolated case and not a taste of things to come as camps gear up for the summer season.</p>
<p>Throughout the Laurentians and across the border in New York, camp directors are dealing with a potential flu outbreak.</p>
<p>In the past, children with the flu have been kept in the camp infirmary, but the highly contagious H1N1 virus has forced camps to come up with new protocols. The majority of camps in Quebec sent letters to parents asking them not to send kids who have had a fever until seven days after the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Some camps have been taking the campers' temperature before they even get on the bus, said Adam Weinstein, executive director of the American Camp Association in New York.</p>
<p>And most of the children who are unlucky enough to develop a fever while at camp will be sent home for at least seven days. Many camps will also set up isolation units for those who can't be sent home because they live too far away.</p>
<p>"The camps are taking it very seriously," said Michelle Goodman, a nurse who will be working at Camp Kinneret-Biluim in the Laurentians.</p>
<p>"We are really hoping parents are respecting the protocol and not sending sick kids to camp." Scott Taylor, executive director of Camp Nominingue in the Laurentians, said he is hoping the camp's proactive measure of sending letters to parents about keeping kids with a fever at home will help keep the situation in check.</p>
<p>"Most parents seem okay with that request," Taylor said this week.</p>
<p>He said the camp for boys is also promoting hand-washing and has installed hand sanitizers throughout the camp.</p>
<p>"We are prepared," he said. "But this virus spreads a lot easier than others." The H1N1 strain differs from seasonal influenza in that many young people are infected and cases are being reported on a daily basis even as summer has arrived.</p>
<p>In fact, about 33 per cent of all cases in Quebec are in the 10- to 19-year-old age group - the highest of any demographic.</p>

</div><div>Garry Marr </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>

<p>Steve Gupta has got guts. Despite fewer people travelling to Canada because of the swine flu, a rising loonie, the failing economy and new passport restrictions, he's building hotels.</p>
<p>The Toronto hotelier believes in his industry, despite sobering industry statistics such as those this week from STR Global, a hotel research company, showing revenue per available room (RevPAR ) in Canada down a staggering 18.7% from the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>"The truth is, some of these things take time to plan," says Mr. Gupta, chief executive of Markham, Ont.-based Easton's Group of Hotels.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, you're half-way there and it's a bit like being half-pregnant. Business is slow but I feel eventually, the economy is going to turn around and you have to be ready for the next upswing."</p>
<p>In April, he opened the $60-million Hilton Garden Inn in downturn Toronto, blocks away from the Rogers Centre, where the Toronto Blue Jays play. He was able to get about $30-million in financing for that project. Even so, the property stands about half-empty most days.</p>
<p>Since then, financing for the industry has all but ground to a halt. Colliers International Hotels said transaction activity last year alone -- things have gotten worse since --plunged 77% from 2007. The average selling price per room fell to $116,500 from $154,200 during the same period.</p>
<p>When it came to remodelling another of his properties, a Comfort Inn in Toronto's downtown east end that is being converted to the Hilton brand, Mr. Gupta said no reputable bank would give him $4-million for the renovation. "I didn't even bother going. I knew I would have to do it on my own," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Gupta isn't the only one feeling exposed. Pressure is on hotels to lower rates as intense competition -- some say the worst since the Depression -- has everybody trying to get a piece of a smaller pie. And lowering rates is a hotel company's last resort, because it can take years for them to recover.</p>
<p>In the early part of this decade, after the double hit of the 9/11 terrorist attacks and the 2002 SARS outbreak, hotels were forced to slash rates to get more tourists to travel. Rates didn't recover until 2005. Now, the combination of recession and swine flu has rates falling again.</p>
<p>In a published interview this week, Mark Woodworth, president of PKF Hospitality Research, predicted big U. S. operators such as <span class="companylink">Marriott International Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc</span>. would need four years to get their room rates back to 2008 levels after cutting them.</p>
<p>"I don't panic, but if someone else cuts rates then I have to, and pretty soon everybody else is doing the same thing," says Mr. Gupta.</p>
<p>Mr. Gupta may not be panicking, but others in the sector are.</p>
<p>The average Canadian daily room rate for the week of June 14-20 had fallen to $129.73 per night, a 9% year-over-year decline. On a RevPAR basis, that's $86.64. Occupancies are 66.8%, a 10% decline from a year earlier.</p>
<p>For consumers, this adds up to some astonishing rate deals. One four-star hotel on Toronto's harbourfront, for example, recently slashed rates as low as $79 per night, and at one point was offering Internet-based reservations for $49 per night.</p>
<p>Hoteliers say one problem that needs immediate attention is the passport issue. As of his month, Americans needed a passport to reenter the United States by car. With only about 30% of Americans holding a passport (compared with 54% of Canadians), the U. S. government is pushing its citizens to get the documents. But many have balked at the US$75-to-US$100 fee, which covers U. S. citizens for a decade.</p>
<p>Greg Klassen, senior vice-president of marketing for the Canadian Tourism Commission, the organization that promotes the industry, understands hoteliers' frustrations. "In the hotel business, it's a product that dies every night. If you don't fill the rooms, you can never get [that money] back," he says.</p>
<p>Canada's travel sector accounts for 10% of all employment in Canada and about 2.5% of gross domestic product, but does not see subsidies comparable to other sectors.</p>
<p>"It exceeds fishery, forestry and agriculture [in terms of economic contribution] put together," says Mr. Klassen. "Tourism is a whole bunch of small and medium business that don't have a big voice. You only have a handful of car companies, but 75,000 businesses that support tourism."</p>
<p>Ottawa is doing more to promote tourism by boosting the CTC's budget. The commission's annual $76-million budget will jump by $20-million in each of the next two tears, with half of the increase aimed at getting Canadians to vacation in Canada.</p>
<p>Outside of Canada, the CTC is targeting select countries: United States, Mexico, France, Germany, United Kingdom, China, Japan, South Korea and Australia.</p>
<p>CIBC World Markets analyst Rossa O'Reilly, who covers the industry, said the fall-off in tourism is so precipitous one has to wonder why there is such preoccupation with the auto sector .</p>
<p>"The sector has received so little in terms of bailouts, and when you think of all the add-ons the typical traveller brings from hotel room taxes and levies, not to mention fees for air tickets, the traveller is beleaguered," says Mr. O'Reilly.</p>
<p>He says the hotel sector has not been in this poor shape since 1932, when RevPAR in the United States dropped 24.7% on a year-over year basis. Statistics don't go that far back in Canada.</p>
<p>"Initially, the decline in revenue per available room was just in occupancies and rates were holding. But in May and June, it's rate cuts as much as occupancies. Hotels are really feeling the absence of visitors," says Mr. O'Reilly. "They will avoid it at all costs but there comes a time when they look at their bookings and they say, 'We need to get people in here,' and they cut their rates. All the chains are sending out e-mails and taking out ads showing the latest deals."</p>
<p>Tony Pollard, president of the Hotel Association of Canada, said the industry needs to differentiate itself from its U. S. counterparts, although he admits RevPAR in the United States is falling faster than it is in Canada (where it is expected to fall to about $81 from about $83 in 2008). "In most cases we are taking a beating on occupancies," he says, adding he expects occupancy levels in Canada to drop to 61% for 2009 from 63% last year.</p>
<p>But the consumer is also out there looking for a deal, so you have to give them something, says Mr. Pollard. "We are offering more but we are doing it by offering [free] Internet access, a breakfast. If you are at a resort, you might get a round of golf thrown in."</p>
<p>He says cutting rates in a downturn has been shown to have no impact on increasing travel.</p>
<p>"Dropping the rate, and we saw this in 1991, does not stimulate travel," says Mr. Pollard. "You are probably already taking a holiday or already travelling somewhere on business. Research shows dropping rates is not going to get you to stay some extra days."</p>
<p>The industry does have some things working in its favour. While demand has stagnated, there has been very little supply growth in Canada, Mr. Gupta's developments notwithstanding. Growth was only 2.4% in 2008 and will dwindle to 1.5% this year, according to the hotel association. By comparison, growth in 1991 was about 25%.</p>
<p>"This time it's not going to be as difficult for us to fill rooms," says Mr. Pollard.</p>
<p>He's going to have to continue working on his members. The trend line shows occupancies falling fast in Canada. For the first four months of the year, occupancies were just 50.3% nationwide, down from 54% for the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>And rates, despite Mr. Pollard's contention, are starting to fall in response. The average Canadian daily room rate in April was $112.96, down from $114.01 a year ago. In some cases, hoteliers just have no choice.</p>

<p>The province is confirming its first serious cases of the H1N1 flu, with two individuals hospitalized in intensive care.</p>
<p>One of the patients is on a ventilator.</p>
<p>But health officials are also urging people with milder cases of the flu not to clog up the province's emergency rooms and clinics.</p>
<p>Dr. Moira McKinnon, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, would not identify where the two people with serious H1N1 cases are from or where they are being treated, citing privacy concerns, but said both patients suffer from "significant" other illnesses in addition to influenza.</p>
<p>"We don't want people to be concerned about the facility that they are in, so at this stage we would prefer to just let you know there are two confirmed (serious) cases," McKinnon added.</p>
<p>One person is between 40 and 50 years old and the other between 60 and 70.</p>
<p>The general public shouldn't be alarmed over the findings, McKinnon told reporters.</p>
<p>Every year, there are about 10 to 30 people who enter intensive care with respiratory illness with a diagnosis of influenza or pneumonia, and some hospitalizations due to H1N1 influenza were anticipated, she said.</p>
<p>McKinnon stressed that people don't need to be tested for H1N1 influenza or seek medical attention if they have a milder case and their symptoms aren't worsening.</p>
<p>"Family physicians and emergency rooms are experiencing a high volume of people coming in for mild illness, for curiosity, just wanting to see if their cough is due to H1N1. Having a test is not going to change the management of those people and it will take away valuable time of the practitioners in the emergency room," she said, adding people should stay home, rest and recover.</p>
<p>The province has confirmed 685 cases, although McKinnon said it's difficult to interpret those numbers because testing is largely being discouraged in the main centres.</p>
<p>However, heightened surveillance continues in the province's isolated communities, including those close to northern Manitoba where some First Nations communities have been hard hit.</p>
<p>"We are testing and treating early in those communities until we know the clinical picture," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations Vice-Chief Glen Pratt said the H1N1 situation is shedding light on some long-standing issues that must be addressed.</p>

<p>Manitoba's Health Department reported yesterday the death of an adult who had tested positive for H1N1 influenza, also known as swine flu. That makes four Manitobans who have died after testing positive for the virus. In two cases, health officials said they do not know whether H1N1 was the cause of death.</p>

<p>It's tough to look at what's going on in the hog industry right now and not give your head a shake.</p>
<p>People used to refer to hog farming as a "mortgage buster" in this province. Thirty years ago, hog operations were typically smaller and integrated into a grain farming operation. So they were undoubtedly less efficient at producing pigs. But Manitoba had gained a reputation for producing high-quality barley-fed pork and these operations were the means by which countless farm families stabilized their grain farming operations and paid for life's little extras, such as a university education for their kids or a renovation on the old farmhouse.</p>
<p>In 1971, there were more than 14,000 hog operators in Manitoba. The average number of hogs per farm was 155. Today, there are fewer than 900 with just under 3,000 head per farm. And the sector is flat busted.</p>
<p>Canadian industry leaders were in Morris last week calling on politicians for an $800-million bailout -- in addition to existing programs paying farmers to downsize their herds and millions of dollars flowing into the sector through established farm programs.</p>
<p>Producers received word last week they qualify for advances on their AgriStability program payments for the third year running. There are significant dollars involved. In 2007, it amounted to just over $51 million going to 491 producers in the province. In 2008, it was 314 producers receiving $32.6 million and this year, it will be 277 producers sharing in $37 million. That averages out to between $103,000 to $136,000 per operation. That's just an advance. There's more to come.</p>
<p>What's sad about these payments is they don't begin to cover the losses that have accrued. What's interesting is the declining number of eligible participants.</p>
<p>Eligible recipients are declining partly because the number of hog producers is rapidly shrinking. But it is also because of the way in which the AgriStability program is structured. Producers' eligibility is based on their sales margins. If those margins decline over time, so do their program payments.</p>
<p>With a sector that has been in a money-losing situation for five out the last seven years, these numbers suggest only about one-third of Manitoba producers qualify for program support. Short of ad hoc government aid or a rapid and dramatic market turnabout -- neither of which appears to be on the horizon -- their futures appear grim.</p>
<p>After two decades of explosive growth, notably egged on by government, the sector is now in a severe state of contraction.</p>
<p>How did this happen?</p>
<p>Producers point the finger at what has come to be known as the "perfect storm" of events that has converged to create the economic free fall.</p>
<p>True, a stronger Canadian dollar, which has reduced the profit margins for exporters, the imposition of country-of-origin labelling legislation in the United States, which has reduced market demand for Canadian piglets, new environmental legislation that has imposed costly changes to operations in Manitoba and higher feed prices are factors that are beyond producers' control.</p>
<p>Couple that with a glut of pork on the North American market due to declining consumption -- purportedly due to the negative publicity surrounding the H1N1 influenza, known as swine flu -- and market analysts see no hope of turning a profit on a pig until sometime next year.</p>
<p>But the potential for this kind of "perfect storm" has been in the industry's vocabulary for years. Producers have long been aware of the risks associated with their investment in an industry built on what has turned out to be an expensive production model and which is heavily dependent on exports to one country in particular. The structure of the industry is such that many producers seemed to have little option but to sail right into it, with an outcome that bears an ominous resemblance to the movie going by the same name.</p>
<p>Politicians are not blameless. The Manitoba government unleashed the mega-pork machine in the late 1990s when it removed the single-desk marketing board authority to allow some of the larger, integrated operations to sell directly to the packers. The government thought it was helping the local packing industry. But instead of going to domestic packers, the pigs went south thanks to a 60-cent dollar and subsidized U.S. corn.</p>
<p>And once the money was borrowed, the barns were built and the production chain in place, the system kept pumping out the pigs even as the operating environment changed and the profitability declined to the point where no one is making any money.</p>
<p>There will no doubt be survivors. Manitoba still has a reputation for producing good pigs and pork. The question of how much and for whom, however, remains open.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu vaccine may overwhelm U. S.; Multiple-shot immunizations to be available by Oct. 15</b>
</div><div>Tom Randall   </div>
<div>Bloomberg</div>
<div>686 words</div><div>27 June 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The vaccine being developed to combat a pandemic of swine flu will require multiple shots to provide immunity from the new virus, and the added immunizations may overwhelm U. S. state agencies, health officials said.</p>
<p>Two injections will be required three weeks apart for swine flu, also known as H1N1, and a third will be needed for seasonal flu, health officials said at a meeting on Friday at the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. Children younger than nine years old will need four shots, the CDC said.</p>
<p>The U. S. government took the unusual step of purchasing all of the swine flu vaccine, and the shots probably will be administered through vaccine clinics set up by state health organizations, the CDC said. The agency estimates that at least 50 million vaccine doses will be available in the U. S. by Oct. 15, and enough vaccine to immunize everyone in the country will be available later in the season.</p>
<p>"Public health departments are under-funded and will get fatigued," said William Schaffner, an influenza expert at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine in Nashville, Tenn., in an interview at the flu conference. "One shot probably gives you very little immunity, 10 per cent to 20 per cent at most."</p>
<p>Two state health-agency representatives said on Friday that vaccinations would be slowed if states are responsible for administering shots instead of doctors' offices and pharmacies, said Jeanne Santoli, head of the CDC's routine vaccine distribution activities.</p>
<p>The CDC hasn't yet determined the role state agencies will play in disseminating the vaccine, and it will be working with states to ensure fast distribution, she said.</p>
<p>"Probably each state will decide what works best. There may be some states that lean toward the public sites and others that lean more toward the private," Santoli said.</p>
<p>Because swine flu is a new virus, most people have no natural immunity. The first shot provides an initial exposure, and the second shot boosts antibody levels in the body, Schaffner said.</p>
<p>People older than age 50 are getting swine flu at far lower rates than younger people, evidence they may have some immunity from prior exposures to a similar virus, and will only need one shot, the CDC said.</p>
<p>Children under nine have little immunity to any flu strain and need two shots for protection against seasonal flu, as well as two for swine flu, the CDC said.</p>
<p>The agency is conducting tests to find the most effective dosing for different age groups.</p>
<p>The new flu is spreading at an epidemic rate earlier than the last two pandemics, in 1957 and 1968, Nancy Cox, director of CDC's flu division, said today in a presentation. In those years, the virus emerged in late spring and subsided during the warmer summer months before picking up again in the fall.</p>
<p>The 2009 version is currently widespread across 11 states and circulating in parts of 19 others, according to a report presented yesterday at the CDC. The number of seasonal flu cases has declined as swine flu spread after it was first identified in April.</p>
<p>"This new infectious disease is not going away," said Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, in a conference call. "In the U. S. we are seeing a steady increase in the number of reported cases. The number reported this week was the largest number reported so far in the outbreak."</p>
<p>A study conducted on ferrets at the CDC, presented today, found the swine flu virus may have symptoms that are more severe than those of seasonal flu and may be more difficult to transmit between people. The study is small and the results may not apply to humans, Cox said in an interview.</p>
<p>Ferrets are often used to study flu because the virus behaves in ferrets similarly to the way it does in humans, making the animal a good model, CDC spokesman Tom Skinner said in an interview.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexican cities close together, but poles apart; Zihuatanejo and Ixtapa both popular with tourists</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mccredie   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service; For Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>511 words</div><div>27 June 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>L2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>They go together like lime and cerveza, a beach chair and a pool deck and nachos and guacamole.</p>
<p>But the Mexican towns of Ixtapa and Zihuatanejo, separated by just five kilometres of rolling seaside jungle and connected by a four-lane highway, couldn't be further apart. At least from a tourist's perspective.</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo was established by Spanish Conquistadors 500 years ago as New Spain's first shipyard.</p>
<p>Ixtapa was built by World Bank bureaucrats in the early 1970s as part of the Mexican government's ambitious resort-building program (Cancun was created the same way and at the same time).</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo is anchored by a small fishing village that has provided fresh seafood daily to area residents and restaurants for centuries.</p>
<p>Ixtapa is anchored by a sprawling Hotel Zone organized in so-called super-blocks owned by big-name hotel chains, and features many restaurants and nightclubs with familiar names to Canadian urbanites.</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo's beach is popular with locals, though each waterfront hotel and villa has its own assigned beachfront.</p>
<p>Ixtapa's beach is limited pretty much to tourists, apart from the friendly hawkers shopping their wares of beads, silver and parasailing on the crescent-shaped beach.</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo's pace is perfect for couples, be they romantic or retired (or both), families with small kids and anyone else who is just looking for a place a little off the beaten path in the sun to read a book, stare at the Pacific and sip a cool drink.</p>
<p>Ixtapa's pace is perfect for those with adventure--both daytime and nighttime--in mind, and anyone else who likes a little more recreation than rest.</p>
<p>But what really sets these two distinct resorts apart is their proximity to one another. While your accommodation is based in one or the other, your activities run the gamut from the best of both worlds: Old Mexico and New Mexico.</p>
<p>IF YOU GO - To say there are bargains to be had on travel packages to Mexico right now and into the foreseeable future is a little like saying the Conquistadors had a bit of an impact on Central America's socio-economic history. - Such deals abound for Ixtapa and similar all-inclusive resort towns up and down the Pacific, with the large corporate hotel chains offering cut-rate prices across the board in hopes of stimulating a tourist business that has turned to a trickle since the H1N1 virus-swine flu -appeared in Mexico in the spring. - Likewise, the mom-and-pop small resorts and villas of Zihuatanejo have slashed nightly rentals. - Flights from major Canadian cities to Ixtapa-Zihuatanejo have also been deeply discounted; however, until the 2009-10 winter season kicks in, you'll most likely have to make a connection when flying from anywhere but Toronto to Zihuatanejo's International Airport.</p>

<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>North American airlines suffered a 10.9 per cent drop passenger traffic in May, as the emergence of the H1N1 virus in Mexico discouraged travel to sun destinations, the International Air Transport Association said Thursday.</p>
<p>Passenger demand was also undermined by recession-driven drops in both transatlantic and transpacific markets, IATA said.</p>
<p>May was the first full month of travel affected by the H1N1 influenza. Mexican carriers saw their traffic fall almost 40 per cent and Latin American carriers generally saw their traffic decline by 9.2 per cent, compared to a year ago.</p>
<p>Canadian carrier <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> resumed flights from Montreal to Cancun June 21, with flights from Vancouver and Toronto returning tomorrow and Monday respectively.</p>
<p>Air Canada Vacations resumed flights to Cancun starting June 6, but flights to Cozumel and Puerto Vallarta will only begin again in the fall. The airline continued to service Mexico City. WestJet resumed flights to Mexico June 20.</p>
<p>The agency warned that a 20 per cent fall in international passenger revenue in the first quarter is expected to accelerate to as much as 30 per cent in May.</p>
<p>"This crisis is the worst we have ever seen," said IATA director general and CEO Giovanni Bisignani.</p>
<p>Despite the large hit absorbed by North American carriers, the aviation association says global passenger traffic stabilized in May even though demand dropped 9.3 per cent from last year and was weaker than the 3.1 per cent drop in April.</p>
<p>A floor in passenger demand may have been reached since the past two months have been slightly stronger than the 11.1 per cent decline reached in March, even after adjusting for Easter.</p>
<p>However, a 5 per cent capacity decrease in May didn't keep up with falling passenger demand. While the impact of the recession appears to be stabilizing, debt and low asset prices are expected to weaken and delay any significant recovery, the association said.</p>
<p>"We may have hit bottom, but we are a long way from recovery," said Bisignani.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu highlights issues around employer rights</b>
</div><div>Howard Levitt   </div>
<div>For Financial Post; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>616 words</div><div>27 June 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>I6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Whatever nomenclature is used, "swine flu" or H1N1 influenza A, the fear of its spread is discombobulating. Already struggling with a sick economy, employers now must countenance a new pandemic with additional deadly financial and reputational liability. Employers should now audit their readiness for crisis.</p>
<p>The courts require employers to provide a safe workplace. If there is any hint that an employee may be a carrier and that employee is not immediately forbidden to attend work, the damages could be incalculable. A class action against such an employer by infected employees, suppliers and customers could decimate the strongest balance sheet. Apart from a lawsuit, imagine the impact of a news report on the breakout of swine flu on, say, a retail chain's business?</p>
<p>Employers should implement policies relating to infectious diseases. Those policies must prohibit employees with any symptoms from attending the workplace and require them to seek immediate medical attention. A notice should be circulated delineating the disease's symptoms and requiring any employees experiencing them to self-report. An employee who fails to comply should be disciplined.</p>
<p>The employee should then be interviewed (by telephone or e-mail) as to who they encountered in the company during the preceding few days. Those employees, in turn, should be sent home and required to be tested immediately. For the purposes of the investigation, to the extent there is a conflict, the rights of your remaining employees to a safe workplace supercede the right of the ill employee to confidentiality.</p>
<p>Some employers have voluntarily continued paying employees to remain at home if their disability benefit policies do not cover their wages, which they will not do if the imposed absence is precautionary.</p>
<p>Other companies have prophylactically not permitted any employee who has visited Mexico from entering the workplace until the incubation period of the disease elapses. In such circumstances, it is reasonable to provide additional work after those few days so they suffer no loss of income. Ensuring their income is kept whole not only reflects legal obligations in most circumstances but encourages sick employees to remain home rather than risk an outbreak.</p>
<p>While it prevents liability, the concomitant absenteeism from this approach can also be debilitating. You should have employees trained to fill key positions to protect against this eventuality.</p>
<p>Employers should also be aware of the following:</p>
<p>- Employees are generally entitled to take unpaid leave if they are sick, must care for sick family members or are quarantined. Unless there is a specific short-term disability benefit policy that covers their particular situation, there is no legal obligation to pay employees during such a leave. Benefits, however, must be continued and employees' jobs protected.</p>
<p>- If a state of emergency is declared, employees unable to work as a result are generally entitled to an unpaid leave of absence until the emergency is lifted.</p>
<p>- Employers also have a duty to accommodate. This means that if employees are able to work but must be absent from the workplace, permit them to work from home if that is practicable.</p>
<p>- Unaffected employees can be required to work overtime without consent during such an emergency.</p>
<p>But beware. Employees may, opportunistically or irrationally, use the professed fear of contagion as an excuse not to work. Do not tolerate that. Employees cannot refuse to work if their workplace is certified safe by government inspectors.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tips for managing misfortune</b>
</div><div>Howard Levitt   </div>

<div>501 words</div><div>27 June 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>I5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Some lawyers, whether as part of a class action or for leverage, specialize in Statements of Claim containing egregious allegations of corporate malfeasance. Once on the public record, such accusations become a target for public debate. But not all companies invite public scrutiny. Some firms have calamitous difficulties thrust on them, while others seem to wish misfortune on themselves.</p>
<p>No matter which direction misfortune comes from and whether the subject is systemic corporate fraud, swine flu or sexual harassment by the chief executive, companies need to know how to react before their market capitalization and their retail following are annihilated. Between my legal and political backgrounds, I have gathered the following key points to managing misfortune:</p>
<p>- Be proactive: Anticipate bad news before it hits the press or the employee gossip mill.</p>
<p>- Prepare a counterattack, whether it's a press conference or marketing campaign, so you can issue it on a dime.</p>
<p>- Respond quickly: Lisa Raitt, the Conservative minister most recently on the hotseat for leaving documents at CTV and for a recording of private comments on the medical isotopes crisis, responded quickly to the first of these. The result, no damage. On the second, she waited several days before apologizing, which left her badly wounded. My client, Ruby Dhalla did not respond to her opponents' attack for several days, despite a substantial arsenal of proof at her disposal. Waiting made it harder for us to reverse opinions that had time to become entrenched.</p>
<p>- Avoid "he said, she said" responses. The singular avenue to success in human resources is documentation, which is especially true in a crisis. In credibility battles, the dispossessed and weaker parties present the more sympathetic case, which is one reason Dhalla had difficulties until it became obvious the nannies' stories were being orchestrated and the hands of her political opponents became visible. However, her case got the biggest boost from the fact she had retained documents that left no doubt the nannies were misstating facts. That led to their stories changing, further eroding their credibility.</p>
<p>- If your company is accused of calumnious conduct, have your proof ready in documents and witness statements, then publicize your evidence. In crisis management, staying under the radar screen and caution only ensures failure.</p>
<p>- Be confident, not defensive: In doing crisis management work for corporations, this is the hardest lesson to implant. Be credible and comfortable in your position. We all remember Bill Clinton's reflections on the meaning of "is." Don't be cocky, but neither should you appear overwhelmed by the situation.</p>
<p>- Tell your story, not theirs: Ensure your version of events is cogent, emotionally appealing and contains good sound bites so it can easily be incorporated into reporters' stories. Anticipate the media's and the public's concerns so that your version of events is both the one picked up by the media and the one accepted by the public as more likely to have happened.</p>

</div><div>By Larry Kusch </div>

</p>
<p>A Manitoba child who tested positive for the H1N1 virus has died, the province reported late Thursday, although health officials still don't know if the flu caused the minor's death.</p>
<p>The government released little information yesterday about the death, except to say it involved "a child under 18 years with underlying medical conditions and a prior lab-confirmed positive test for H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the province reported two H1N1 flu deaths -- a Winnipeg man in his 40s who had no known significant underlying health conditions and a woman from the Nor-Man health region who had "significant underlying conditions."</p>
<p>Manitoba Health said Thursday that there have been 458 reported laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 in Manitoba to date.</p>
<p>Joel Kettner, chief provincial public health officer, said the latest death is still under investigation.</p>
<p>"We're trying to determine whether the H1N1 had anything to do with this child's death," he said in an interview Thursday evening.</p>
<p>"We know that this child had a positive lab result and then subsequently died, but there are some questions about the cause-and-effect relationship here between the test results and the outcome," he said.</p>
<p>That's why the province is "being very, very limited" in the information it is willing to release right now.</p>
<p>Kettner wouldn't indicate how long an interval there had been between the child's positive test and their death.</p>
<p>The province wouldn't give the child's age or gender or state whether he or she was from Winnipeg.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, however, reported late Thursday the child in question was not a First Nations resident.</p>
<p>Kettner said there would be more information forthcoming if further tests determined a direct causal link between H1N1 and the child's death.</p>
<p>The province said it continues to monitor closely the level of severe respiratory illness in Manitoba.</p>
<p>As of June 22, there were 37 patients on ventilators in intensive care units with severe respiratory illness in Manitoba.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No swine-flu outbreaks on B.C. reserves; Some gains, some setbacks in health of natives</b>
</div><div>Cheryl Chan </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>395 words</div><div>26 June 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province </div>
</p>
<p>Provincial health authorities are keeping a close watch on B.C.'s native population for possible outbreaks of swine flu.</p>
<p>Severe cases of the H1N1 virus have ravaged reserves in Manitoba, Ontario and Nunavut. Manitoba is particularly hard hit, prompting First Nations chiefs to call on the provincial and federal governments to declare a state of emergency.</p>
<p>Provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall said B.C. reserves have so far been spared an outbreak.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen a similar outbreak here, but we are monitoring it closely and have pre-positioned supplies like hand-sanitizers and anti-viral drugs," said Kendall. "If we get signals, we can go straight in."</p>
<p>There is no comparative data to explain why aboriginal communities here haven't been hit as hard, said Kendall, speculating that local reserves may have better access to running water, less cramped living conditions and populations with lower rates of diabetes compared with other reserves.</p>
<p>A 301-page provincial report, titled Pathways to Health and Healing released yesterday, showed that the health of B.C.'s native population has made significant gains in some areas, but deteriorated in others.</p>
<p>Out of 64 indicators of health, 18 have improved since the last report in 2001, while 10 have worsened and eight have recorded increasing rates of chronic disease.</p>
<p>"The gains are significant, but it's evident there's a lot more work that needs to be done," said Kendall.</p>
<p>Life expectancy among aboriginal men went up from 71.4 years in 2001 to 73 in 2006, largely due to declining mortality from external causes, such as deaths from motor-vehicle accidents, drug- and alcohol-related deaths and suicides.</p>
<p>Aboriginal women recorded little change in life expectancy.</p>
<p>Infant mortality, while still higher than non-aboriginals, has also dropped, as has youth suicides, which went down by about 30 per cent.</p>
<p>However, the report also showed an increase in treatable conditions, such as pre-term births, off-reserve tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS. It also recorded an increased prevalence in chronic diseases such as diabetes and dementia.</p>
<p>Grand Chief Edward John of the First Nations Summit said the report gives native communities a sense of where their direction and priorities ought to be.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Gov't seeks livestock aid; Saskatchewan calls for federal funds to support producers</b>

<p>Saskatchewan's livestock industry needs federal assistance in line with funding sent to Ontario's auto industry and B.C.'s forestry sector, provincial Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud said Thursday.</p>
<p>Cattle and hog producers are dealing with a frustrating combination of low prices and the introduction of country of origin labelling (COOL) in the United States. Additionally the H1N1, or so-called swine flu, scare is affecting pork sales and poor spring weather is causing a pasture and hay shortage affecting Saskatchewan's cattle industry, the minister said.</p>
<p>Financial assistance to livestock producers from Saskatchewan's cattle and hog support program is making its way into the hands of affected producers, but the dollar amounts going to livestock operations could have been higher had the federal government agreed to increase its funding through the program, Bjornerud said.</p>
<p>"I guess my argument was you're giving assistance to the auto industry and some of the other sectors . . . our cattle industry in Saskatchewan is as important to us as the auto industry is in Ontario," Bjornerud said Thursday.</p>
<p>The minister, speaking after a presentation at the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan (APAS) mid-term convention in Saskatoon, said some producers -- especially in the cattle sector -- are closing their operations and walking away as the economics are too dire to continue. In recent weeks, he said, the provincial government has opened additional pasture land and, working with the federal department of Agriculture and Agri-Food, made changes to crop insurance to allow cows to graze on fields where the crop has failed.</p>
<p>Bjornerud plans to ask for more federal funding for livestock producers when he meets with federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz in Ontario July 8-9.</p>
<p>"We're going to certainly raise the issue, whether we get anywhere or not will be totally up to the federal government," he said. "We know they're in a situation where dollars aren't that easy to come by, but that doesn't mean we're not going to be putting that on the table."</p>
<p>Laurent Pellerin, president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture, said Canada's livestock industry needs immediate financial help. It's not just the beef and pork sectors in Saskatchewan that are facing difficulties, he said at the APAS convention, but cattle and hog sectors across the country.</p>
<p>The pork industry, specifically, is facing huge hurdles, Pellerin explained.</p>
<p>"We need new cash, money, liquidity at the farm level to make sure the farmer will be able to pay their bills next week, next month, because that's really the crucial question for hog farmers: How will I pay my bills next week?" he said.</p>
<p>Already, he said, pork production in Canada has dropped by 10 per cent over last year and could continue to decline if prices don't improve soon.</p>
<p>"If we lose too much (production) we are also losing our critical mass for the packers, for the processors, and it creates an inefficiency when we don't have this critical mass," Pellerin said. "(It's) about time we sit down and go through a plan for the crisis, we don't know where we are going now, we are waiting for the recovery of the market, we are not acting very aggressively to change the conditions."</p>
<p>In a statement to The StarPhoenix Thursday, Ritz said there's always ways to improve programs that help farmers, adding the federal government is always willing to work with farmers to tweak existing programs.</p>
<p>"We continue to put farmers first by working with farmers to build stable, bankable programs that backstop the farm gate, without provoking trade retaliation," said Ritz, the MP for Battlefords-Lloydminster.</p>
<p>The federal minister said Agriculture and Agri-Food has a long history working with the Saskatchewan government.</p>
<p>"Our government has delivered $1.7 billion for Saskatchewan farmers in the past two years and they know we'll be there for them in the future," he said.</p>

</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>

<div>758 words</div><div>26 June 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>D10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post </div>
</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the spread of swine flu among aboriginal Canadians a major concern on Thursday, while the country's chief public health officer said he understands the complaints expressed this week by First Nations leaders, and that his agency is working to address them.</p>
<p>"We are very concerned, obviously, about H1N1 generally and, in particular, the high incidence we've seen in aboriginal communities, particularly in Manitoba," Harper said in Halifax.</p>
<p>The swine flu, also called H1N1, has infected more than 6,700 Canadians in every province and territory, and has been linked to 19 deaths in this country.</p>
<p>Among the reserves hit by the illness were two remote communities in northern Manitoba that had to fly patients to Winnipeg for treatment. According to the Assembly of First Nations, aboriginal people represent a disproportionate number of the severe cases of swine flu among the 458 Manitobans who have the virus.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the province reported the death of a child who had been diagnosed with swine flu, bringing the number of deaths connected with the virus in Manitoba to three.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health said the child had "underlying medical conditions," but did not provide an age, other than to say he or she was "under 18 years" of age. Nor did it say where the child was from.</p>
<p>The prime minister said experts are still trying to determine the epidemiology of the virus.</p>
<p>"The truth is, we really don't know why H1N1 is more severe among certain populations rather than others," said Harper, "but it is a major concern, and the Department of Health is working with the communities affected to try to address it."</p>
<p>Leaders from the aboriginal community criticized Harper's government this week over its handling of the spread of the disease on reserves, and some demanded an apology.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a federal health official told a Senate committee that, following the outbreaks on reserves, there were discussions about whether to send alcohol-based hand sanitizers, as requested by some communities, because of concerns it would be abused by alcoholics.</p>
<p>The revelation prompted accusations of paternalism and racism against the government.</p>
<p>A chief from one of the affected communities, however, said a similar discussion took place among his band council, because Garden Hill First Nation, about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg, is a dry reserve where alcohol is banned, and Chief David Harper said he has known of cases where hand sanitizers have been ingested.</p>
<p>He and other aboriginal leaders were dissatisfied with the federal government's response to the outbreaks, saying it took too long for supplies to be delivered. There were breakdowns in communication between provincial and federal governments, they added.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the Chiefs of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs called for a state of emergency to be declared, because they want more help for First Nations communities to deal with the pandemic.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said in an interview with Canwest News Service that a state of emergency might help First Nations in their own response, but the federal government is already operating at "full tilt" to implement the country's pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"The challenges for many of these communities are huge, even at the best of times," said Butler-Jones. "It is trying to understand what aspects of that we can address short-term, while the communities themselves, and other levels of governments, are working on the longer-term challenges."</p>
<p>"People have really pulled out the stops," Butler-Jones said in response to the outbreaks on reserves, but he acknowledged the system didn't work perfectly.</p>
<p>"Could it have been faster? Could it have been different? That's always possible and it's always true," said Butler-Jones. "That's why we do lessons learned so, hopefully, we don't make the same mistake, or we're quicker at responding next time."</p>
<p>The public-health agency will spend the summer reviewing how Canada's pandemic plan worked since it was activated in April, and will continue to modify plans leading up to the fall when the illness is expected to ramp up, he said.</p>
<p>Overall, Butler-Jones said the pandemic plan has been effectively implemented, but there were some surprises along the way.</p>
<p>"We still have some gaps and holes to plug. That, I think, needs to be the focus over the next month or two, so we're in a good position for the fall," he said.</p>

<p>Summer is finally here. Even to a slightly neurotic shut-in like myself, that means walks in the sun, long idyllic days and fields of grass crawling with vacationing children like bugs on roadkill. In my nightmares, I imagine them dripping with swine-flu laden fluids, hands unwashed for weeks and filthy from grubbing through the tetanus-contaminated dirt of lawns and parks. This transforms my planned summer strolls into an exercise in avoiding viral mines. So, please, parents. Take pity on a germ-phobic writer and give your kids something to do over the summer that isn't giving me typhus. Here are some suggestions for summer activities, inspired by recently released under the radar DVDs.</p>
<p>Transformers: The Complete First Season (1984)</p>
<p>www.shoutfactory.com[http://www.shoutfactory.com]</p>
<p>There's nothing kids like better than action figures, but savvy parents know that some toys are hazardous. Instead, amuse your kids with this first season of Transformers, packed with extras that don't taste like lead paint.</p>
<p>Eddie Murphy: Delirious (1983)</p>
<p>anchorbayentertainment.com</p>
<p>Just because your kids are out of school doesn't mean that they can't learn. Improve their English skills by having them replace each of the 200-plus instances of profanity in this legendary stand-up performance with a different adjective. It's like Mad Libs with Tourette's!</p>
<p>Nero's Golden House (2001)</p>
<p>www.seventh-art.com[http://www.seventh-art.com]</p>
<p>"Leadership" activities are an important aspect of summer camps. But you can get the same effect with this fascinating documentary on Roman Emperor Nero and his opulent palaces, provided you want your children to grow up to be megalomaniacs.</p>
<p>Circle of Iron (1978) on Blu-Ray</p>
<p>www.blue-underground.com[http://www.blue-underground.com]</p>
<p>It's important to keep your kids active over the summer, so inspire them with this story of a kung-fu quest starring the late, great David Carradine in four roles. They'll learn to backflip, catch flies with their hands and crucify Gypsy concubines. Um, actually, maybe just show them the first half.</p>
<p>Lesbian Nation</p>
<p>www.firstrunfeatures.com[http://www.firstrunfeatures.com]</p>
<p>Kids can spend some time over the summer learning about diversity. Use this collection of lesbian-themed short films, including Carmelita Tropicana, which features a prison-cell musical number that feels like Steven Sondheim rewriting Reform School Girls.</p>
<p>Wandering Ginza Butterfly (1972)</p>
<p>www.synapse-films.com[http://www.synapse-films.com]</p>
<p>A hobby, like billiards, helps keep kids out of trouble. Not only is it fun, but on the off-chance children incur the wrath of a yakuza gang, this excellent cult film about a female gang leader proves how effective a pool-cue bludgeon can be.</p>
<p>Nightmare Castle (1965)</p>
<p>www.severin-films.com[http://www.severin-films.com]</p>
<p>Band camp may be expensive and Guitar Hero colour-coded button mashing too Pavlovian, but there's no reason your kids can't spend the summer playing music. Maybe start with the fantastic Ennio Morricone score from this atmospheric horror film about a woman held captive by her husband.</p>
<p>Hansel & Gretel (2008)</p>
<p>www.evokativefilms.com[http://www.evokativefilms.com]</p>
<p>Kids should be prevented from wandering around beside busy streets or near the mysterious forest of this beautifully moody South Korean film about a fairy tale world. The former may lead to injury, and the latter to a career writing fey young-adult fantasy novels.</p>
<p>Girl on a Motorcycle (1968)</p>
<p>Redemption Films</p>
<p>Give your kids a summer project. They may be too young to learn to drive, but they're never too young to wear a full-body protective motorcycle suit, like Marianne Faithful in this psychedelic road movie. Just make sure no one catches Mad Cow Disease from the leather.</p>

<p>The Level 2 nursery at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto has been shut down because of H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>The ward stopped accepting admissions on Tuesday after the hospital learned that someone who has tested positive for the virus had been in the nursery, said Allison McGeer , the hospital's director of infection control.</p>
<p>The babies in the Level 2 nursery are typically premature and very small, and therefore vulnerable to infection. None of the 15 or 16 babies who were in the nursery at the time of exposure have shown any signs of the virus, she said yesterday, but they are being monitored.</p>
<p>Dr. McGeer refused for confidentiality reasons to say whether the person who exposed the nursery to the virus was a parent, nurse or visitor.</p>
<p>She said that on Monday afternoon "there was a non-baby in the unit" who was unaware that he or she had the virus. The person contacted the hospital after realizing they were ill, and the nursery was closed. The individual is at home recovering, Dr. McGeer said.</p>
<p>The ward will reopen on Monday, Dr. McGeer said. All other wards are open.</p>

<p>If a completely untutored, naive visitor came for a stroll around my Edmonton neighbourhood, I suspect he would reach some odd conclusions from the litter he saw around him. "These people must have a real neurosis about odour," he might say to himself. "It looks as though they carry big bottles of Listerine with them when they leave the house, and they use so much of it that they end up emptying the containers outright and leaving them lying around in hedges and alleyways!" Well, I hate to destroy anyone's pleasant illusions, but the heavy mouthwash usage in Edmonton's downtown has nothing to do with keeping anyone's breath minty fresh.</p>
<p>Much is being made right now of Health Canada's internal debate over whether to dispatch hand sanitizers containing denatured ethanol -- like the kind in mouthwash -- to aboriginal communities in northern Manitoba. The Financial Post's William Watson, for instance, complained of government "paternalism," saying that "the scandal is not that bureaucrats behaved like bureaucrats. The scandal is that people in Ottawa are signing off on whether people living thousands of miles away get hand sanitizer." Most observers have concluded sympathetically that there is a "damned if you do, damned if you don't" problem here, though it can just as easily be described as a "cover your butt" problem.</p>
<p>What Prof. Watson might have missed is that the federal government has obligations toward the affected Indians that are not quite "paternalistic" in nature, but arguably contractual. The flu-stricken parts of Manitoba are subject to the terms of Treaty No. 5, which some bands signed less than 100 years ago. As it happens, one of the things the Indian signatories insisted on was that "no intoxicating liquor shall be allowed to be introduced or sold" on Manitoba reserves, and that Ottawa do everything in its power to "preserve [the Queen's] Indian subjects inhabiting the reserves, or living elsewhere within Her North-west Territories, from the evil influence of the use of intoxicating liquors."</p>
<p>If Health Canada were to take those treaty terms literally, it would be positively bound not to supply an abusable ethanol product to Manitoba's aboriginal communities. Likely no one would want to see lives lost because of treaty language that is reinterpreted pretty flexibly by contemporary governments and Indians anyhow. But it would be fair to say that federal officials do have a special responsibility, one transcending purely utilitarian considerations, to take substance-abuse concerns into account.</p>
<p>And obviously at least some Indians would agree. Chief David Harper of the Garden Hill band is being lauded for taking his own actions, without waiting for Ottawa, to secure a supply of bottled hand sanitizer for his people; what some may have overlooked is that Harper first discussed the dangers of importing ethanol with his band council, concluded that they were genuine and ultimately opted to purchase an alcohol-free product. So one can hardly criticize Health Canada for doing exactly what Chief Harper did, and talking things out before arranging an airlift of Purell.</p>
<p>The agency was confronted with a tough public-health decision based on complicated variables and requiring extreme haste. No one knew exactly how hard H1N1 would hit in Manitoba. Hand sanitizer, as an item of pandemic preparedness, is probably superfluous in the urban homes that would already have the stuff around; there is no convincing evidence that it is any more effective than just using soap and water. But many of the homes on northern Manitoba reserves have no interior running water, and in that setting, the incremental benefit of a wash-and-go sanitizer might be considerable.</p>
<p>What the Indians of Manitoba are asking is why this wasn't settled in advance. And they are right to ask. Many of these same communities were devastated by the Spanish flu of 1918-19, and the conditions that made them particularly vulnerable then--crowded living arrangements, poor respiratory health -- still exist. In fact, the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Company</span> records from the region have been the subject of special attention by Spanish flu researchers, because of their demographic comprehensiveness and the potential they offer for tracking the disease through specific extended families. H1N1's unusual impact on northern Manitoba was foreseeable by anyone who has studied pandemic disease in Canada.</p>
<p>H1N1 is also being used, opportunistically, to renew the eternal, tiresome debate over exactly who is to blame for First Nations poverty and living conditions. But even those who take the hardest line possible, and grumble that the Indians have effectively chosen to live the way they do, would be within their rights to ask why questions fundamental to pandemic planning weren't realistically addressed earlier. It's not about genocide or white guilt, but about competence.</p>

<p>It's perhaps fitting that the King of Pop, he of the feverish, crotch-grabbing dance moves and the glittering epaulets, dominated cyberspace with his sensational exit.</p>
<p>Immediately after celebrity gossip website TMZ.com announced Michael Jackson had suffered a cardiac arrest and been rushed to a Los Angeles hospital, the site was flooded with traffic and was forced to shut down temporarily. As the news was confirmed elsewhere and rumours flew, unprecedented traffic slowed popular websites and crashed online columnist Perez Hilton's blog.</p>
<p>The growing mass of cellphone-bearing humanity crowding around the University of California at Los Angeles Medical Centre, where Mr. Jackson was taken via ambulance from his Bel Air mansion, helped bring down wireless reception and slow the 3G network in the area.</p>
<p>“As human traffic increased at the UCLA Medical Center, it appeared that the <span class="companylink">AT&T</span> cellular network slowed, with 3G access cutting out from time to time. Internet access through UCLA hit quite hard, even with some web page timeouts … it was a unique and interesting correlation of human social interaction up, cellular connectivity down,” UCLA professor Brad Fidler told The Globe and Mail.</p>
<p>Competing Wikipedia editors waged a brief war on Michael Jackson's entry on the online community-edited encyclopedia, with some would-be hagiographers adding a date of death to Mr. Jackson's biographical information and more cautious editing sticklers deleting it again.</p>
<p>The controversial performer's death exploded across the Internet, topping the charts of trending topics on the social-networking site Twitter and sparking innumerable conspiracy-surmising blogs. By 7 p.m., posts reacting to Mr. Jackson's death by far outnumbered any references to the Iranian election, swine flu or the death yesterday of 1970s icon Farrah Fawcett. Ethan Zuckerman, a fellow at the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard, posted that references to Mr. Jackson accounted for a full 15 per cent of tweets – more than three times the 140-character attention span commanded by the Iranian election or the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson's death dominated seven of the 10 “trending topics” on popular social-networking site Twitter.</p>
<p>Online rumours surrounding Mr. Jackson's death swirled: As late as 7 p.m., long after Mr. Jackson's death had been confirmed by the L.A. coroner's office, bloggers and Tweeters posted links to stories that he was in a coma.</p>

</p>
<p>Kelowna, B.C. -- According to the World Health Organization, the worldwide prevalence of H1N1 is less than one case per 100,000 people. Cases are clustered in certain countries, notably Mexico, the U.S., U.K and, recently – the trigger for calling a pandemic – Australia. Canada is frequently referred to as a “hot spot,” but just how “hot” is seldom discussed here.</p>
<p>Few realize that the current figures – cases per 100,000 population – are: Mexico, 7.1; U.S., 7.1; U.K., 4.6; and Canada, a colossal 20 cases per 100,000 people. Only Australia is in the same league, with 13 cases per 100,000 population.</p>
<p>Worse, within Canada, we have some very hot spots indeed. Saskatchewan reports 61 cases per 100,000 residents; Manitoba is not much better at 45. The differences within Canada (five cases per 100,000 in B.C. versus more than 60 in Saskatchewan) suggest underlying social and economic factors, as well as differences in public-health preparedness. Reports of disproportionate incidence within aboriginal communities add to this complex picture (Manitoba Chiefs Call For State Of Emergency – June 25).</p>
<p>It's high time the federal and provincial governments took these facts seriously and became more forthright regarding Canada's public health. Our record is a sorry one.</p>

</p>
<p>The hand sanitizer controversy drove Carolyn Bennett nuts.</p>
<p>As a physician, the Liberal MP was acutely aware of the importance of hand washing in controlling the H1N1 pandemic. But as Canada's former minister of public health, she knew a bottle of squirt-on germ killer was no substitute for safe drinking water, decent housing and proper garbage disposal.</p>
<p>This week, as Bennett's parliamentary colleagues squabbled over the advisability of distributing alcohol-based hand sanitizer to aboriginal communities, she flew to the three Manitoba reserves hardest hit by the flu outbreak.</p>
<p>She saw 10 to 15 people living in a single house. She toured a community where 80 per cent of the residents didn't have running water. She saw piles of rotting garbage and windows with plastic covers.</p>
<p>"These are breeding grounds for infection," she said. "It's not surprising people are getting sick."</p>
<p>Bennett understands why the chiefs of some First Nations don't want hand sanitizer - which is typically 60 per cent alcohol - on their reserves. They've fought extremely hard to curb substance abuse. They are determined to keep their communities "dry."</p>
<p>But it's absurd that this one tiny piece of the pandemic puzzle has become the focus of the debate, she fumes. It is allowing the government to duck the bigger issues.</p>
<p>The brouhaha erupted Tuesday when a Health Canada official testified at the Senate aboriginal affairs committee that the government did not ship alcohol-based hand sanitizer to aboriginal communities in the nascent stages of the outbreak. Some chiefs were asking for alcohol-free hand sanitizer, explained Anne-Marie Robinson, assistant deputy minister for the First Nations and Inuit branch of Health Canada. The government didn't have any. It was scrambling to procure a shipment. "That discussion was had with the best interest of our clients in mind."</p>
<p>Her revelation prompted a swift, angry outcry.</p>
<p>"It's outrageous, the ignorance and possibly some racism, expressed toward First Nation people," said Sydney Garrioch, one of Manitoba's grand chiefs. He called on the government to apologize to residents of the flu-stricken reserves.</p>
<p>"The whole community was put at risk because someone was worried that a handful of people might abuse the stuff," said David McDougall, chief of Theresa Point, one of the affected reserves.</p>
<p>"I think it's another example of the paternalistic attitude with which aboriginal people are treated," said (Liberal) Senator Sharon Carstairs.</p>
<p>For Bennett, the whole spectacle was demoralizing.</p>
<p>She agrees that Health Canada should have purchased alcohol-free hand sanitizer years ago as part of a pandemic preparedness strategy. But that is the last line of defence, she points out.</p>
<p>Why did so few alarm bells go off when the school on the Garden Hill reserve had to be closed in mid-May because half the kids were sick? Why did no one recognize the symptoms of H1N1 until the first child was medevacked to Winnipeg? What will happen if there is a second wave of flu in the fall, as some medical experts are predicting? And what is the government doing about the underlying conditions that make so many aboriginal people susceptible to any infection that comes along?</p>
<p>It is surely no coincidence that most of the 78 flu patients from the three reserves were found to have pre-existing chronic conditions that put them at elevated risk.</p>
<p>So far, there have been no deaths. But medical authorities in Winnipeg worry that they won't have enough ventilators.</p>
<p>"It makes me crazy," Bennett said. She would be the first to agree that sanitation is essential in fighting infection and illness. But it doesn't come in plastic bottles.</p>

<p>Another transatlantic flight has been diverted to St. John's airport because a passenger on board died. It's the second time this week that has happened.</p>
<p>A 63-year-old man died on a <span class="companylink">Delta Air Lines</span><span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 767 flight from New York to London. The plane landed in</p>
<p>St. John's at 1:30 a.m. yesterday and left two hours later.</p>
<p>The province's medical examiner, Simon Avis, called it a natural death.</p>
<p>"I can state that his death in no way has any public-health issues, given the concern of H1N1 [swine flu] and quarantining and what have you. There's no risk to anyone who had any contact with him prior to, during or after the flight. No evidence of any infectious or contagious diseases."</p>
<p>On Monday, a 41-year-old man died on board an <span class="companylink">Air France</span> plane from Montreal to Paris.</p>
<p>"Having planes land with deceased individuals on board is not as uncommon as you might think," Avis said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 crisis deepens - Chiefs hope declaration will prompt more action to deal with pandemic</b>
</div><div>By Geoff Kirbyson </div>
<div>784 words</div><div>25 June 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs has declared a state of emergency over the H1N1 flu pandemic, a move it hopes will rattle the cages of the province and the federal government and cause them to spring into action to combat the potentially deadly virus.</p>
<p>AMC Grand Chief Ron Evans said he and his fellow chiefs want to ensure government officials are fully aware of the devastating impact the H1N1 virus is having in their communities throughout the province.</p>
<p>"The governments need to step up. There is no plan in place. Nobody wants to accept responsibility for First Nations. There is very little combatting the H1N1 pandemic. Our people are sick," Evans said at a press conference at the AMC's downtown headquarters Wednesday.</p>
<p>The AMC's desperate call for action came as the province announced the number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Manitoba jumped by 163, bringing the total to 458. As of Monday, 37 patients with the most severe flu-like symptoms have been put on ventilators in intensive care units.</p>
<p>Evans and 11 other chiefs decried the province's inability to complete even the most simple of tasks on a timely basis -- getting hand sanitizers into the communities that needed them -- describing it as "a political and bureaucratic nightmare."</p>
<p>Part of the problem is that commonly used hand sanitizer products can contain upward of 60 per cent alcohol and there was concern among health officials as well as some First Nations chiefs, that the sanitizers could be misused for intoxication.</p>
<p>Anne-Marie Robinson, assistant deputy minister of Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit health branch, told a Senate committee of discussions between chiefs and public health officials about sending alcohol-based products into communities with addiction problems because there have been "rare" cases where it has been problematic. Robinson would not disclose which reserves had been involved in the discussions and never linked the talks with the "difficulty" she acknowledged was experienced in getting hand sanitizer to some of the chiefs who had asked for it.</p>
<p>David Harper, chief of the Garden Hill First Nation, which is located about 600 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg on Island Lake, said he has heard before of people ingesting hand sanitizer to get intoxicated and that his own band council talked about the alcohol-based products because Garden Hill is a dry reserve where alcohol isn't allowed. He said they quickly identified alternative products and there's no excuse for the delay in getting supplies to Garden Hill when so many people were getting sick.</p>
<p>Harper said he waited for more than two weeks for hand sanitizer and other supplies to arrive, by which point he had already purchased $15,000 worth of merchandise.</p>
<p>A shipment of 2,500 bottles of sanitizer did arrive in Garden Hill last week from the federal government -- they were alcohol-based. Some has been distributed to families and some of the stock is being kept at the school and a police station. Harper said the federal government has shown a willingness to get off its wallet when it comes to other catastrophes in the past. For example, it doled out $425 million in aid after southeast Asia was hit by a tsunami in 2004 and it partnered with the province to bail out Manitoba hog producers, who have been suffering an economic backlash because H1N1 was originally called "swine flu," with another $37.7 million. Harper said aboriginal leaders would welcome Canadian soldiers with open arms if the federal government opts to deploy them to reserves to help fight H1N1.</p>
<p>"If Canadian forces are being sent all over the world to help out, why not in our communities? We need help," he said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald said the province didn't have a specific response to the AMC's plea because it has effectively been in a state of emergency since April. The province calls it incident command status, instead.</p>
<p>Oswald said she and members of the province's health incident command team have taken a number of measures to deal with the pandemic, including invoking an emergency provision in the collective agreements of doctors and nurses to reassign them where they're needed, postponing elective surgeries to build capacity in the hospital system for intensive care patients and having First Nations leaders participate directly in its pandemic response structure.</p>
<p>Oswald said she spoke to Evans Wednesday afternoon and asked for a list of areas where the province hasn't delivered and he wasn't able to provide any specific shortcomings.</p>

</p>
<p>Manitoba First Nations chiefs yesterday called on the provincial and federal governments to declare a state of emergency because of the spread of swine flu on reserves.</p>
<p>"With the H1N1 virus spreading rapidly through the communities and supplies taking nearly a month to be delivered, the First Nations people are at too much risk for this situation to continue any longer," said Ron Evans, the grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs. "We've had enough."</p>
<p>The assembly issued the plea for more help after meeting in Winnipeg and said there is a "rising sense of worry" about the looming fall flu season.</p>
<p>The request for a state of emergency comes on the heels of controversial testimony Tuesday at a Senate committee in Ottawa that was studying the spread of H1N1 among aboriginals.</p>
<p>Anne-Marie Robinson, assistant deputy minister of Health Canada's First Nations and Inuit Health Branch, told the committee that discussions took place between chiefs and public health officials about sending alcohol-based products into communities with addiction problems because there have been "rare"cases where it has been problematic. Some commonly used hand sanitizer products can contain upward of 60 per cent alcohol.</p>
<p>Those comments are "partially racism and partly ignorance," Grand Chief Sydney Garrioch, the representative for Manitoba's northern reserves, said yesterday. "I want to make sure that an apology comes forward from the minister of health on behalf of her department as well as the bureaucrats."</p>
<p>Garden Hill Chief David Harper is also looking for an apology.</p>
<p>Because more than half of the homes in his community of 4,000 do not have running water and people cannot wash their hands frequently, hand sanitizer was in high demand.</p>
<p>Harper said he waited for more than two weeks for sanitizer and other supplies to arrive, by which point he already had bought $15,000 worth of merchandise.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadian companies to manage Russian Olympic construction; Canadian 2010 expertise in demand for 2014 Games</b>
</div><div>David Akin </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>482 words</div><div>25 June 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>Montreal-based construction giant <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span> opened an office Wednesday in Sochi, Russia, as it signed a deal to manage and maintain construction facilities for the 2014 Winter Olympics.</p>
<p>Trade Minister Stockwell Day, who was in Sochi as part of a three-day trade mission to Russia, said the experience Canadian companies have gained in designing, planning and building for the 2010 Winter Games in Vancouver are giving them a leg up as potential partners for Russian firms involved in Olympic development. He led representatives of more than 30 Canadian companies to Sochi.</p>
<p>The Russian government expects to spend about $12 billion US on Winter Olympic infrastructure in Sochi.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>'s agreement is with <span class="companylink">Russian Railways</span> to manage the construction and maintenance of transportation facilities for the 2014 Games. The government did not disclose the value of the contract and <span class="companylink">SNC-Lavalin</span>'s Montreal offices were closed for Quebec's Fete nationale holiday.</p>
<p>Sochi is like Vancouver in the sense that it's tucked in between a steep mountain range and a large body of water. Transportation routes, for example, are well-established but relatively narrow. As a result, companies keen to get involved in infrastructure, security, logistics or other projects there, will face challenges that were similar to those in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Sochi is on Russia's Black Sea coast, just north of Georgia. It's a popular tourist spot for Russians because one can go swimming at Sochi's subtropical warm-water beaches in the morning and, an hour's drive later, up into 2,000-metre-high mountains, one can go skiing.</p>
<p>"Sochi has been the recreational spot for Russians for decades," Day said. "And they've increasingly been getting international [tourists]. The Olympics will really ratchet that up for them, and that's why we've got some good inroads with Canadian companies. They want Canadian expertise who know how to build in these situations ... and can meet the demands of Olympic standards."</p>
<p>Day was in Russia to try to boost the relatively small amount of annual two-way trade between the countries. Russia and Canada trade about $3.5 billion worth of goods each year. The Russians buy mostly machinery and meat; Canadians buy fuel, precious minerals and fertilizers.</p>
<p>Earlier on his visit, Day was in Moscow, where he pressed Russian leaders, including First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Zubkov, to open Russian markets to Canadian pork producers. Russia banned Canadian pork imports because of fears of swine flu.</p>
<p>Day said Russia's top veterinary official participated in some of the meetings. The Russians, Day said, asked for more information about the spread of the virus in Canada, but did not signal any movement yet on the pork ban.</p>
<p>Day then left Russia for Saudi Arabia.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Parents urged not to panic; No need to keep kids home due to swine flu virus unless they are sick, official says after child's death</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>713 words</div><div>25 June 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>In the wake of the death of a 6-year-old Brampton girl who had swine flu, public health officials are urging parents not to panic by pulling their children out of summer camps or classes.</p>
<p>"You can't live in a bubble," Dr. Barbara Yaffe, associate medical officer of health for Toronto, said yesterday, noting the virus is already circulating in the community.</p>
<p>She said parents should keep children home only if they are sick. And if parents are concerned their children have developed a fever or any other flu symptoms, they should call their health care provider or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000.</p>
<p>Her advice comes after the death of Rubjit "Ruby" Thindal, a Grade 1 student at Roberta Bondar Public School. The child died in the arms of her father on June 15 as she was being rushed to hospital. She began experiencing flu symptoms only the night before. Tests performed after she died revealed she had the H1N1 influenza virus. The cause of her death has not yet been determined, but it is known the virus was a factor.</p>
<p>Public health officials revealed yesterday there have been three more deaths associated with the H1N1 virus in Ontario since Monday, bringing the total to seven. They are concerned about the continuing increase in infections because it was hoped the numbers would dwindle as the weather got warmer. Influenza viruses tend to lie low in summer months because they don't like humidity.</p>
<p>"There continues to be a lot of activity with the H1N1 flu virus and Ontarians should remain vigilant in monitoring their health and that of their loved ones," Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The latest deaths include a 68-year-old Durham Region man, a 17-year-old Ottawa male and a 52-year-old woman from Eastern Ontario. All three had underlying health problems. Individuals with pre-existing medical conditions - including diabetes, obesity or respiratory problems such as asthma - are at greater risk of suffering serious complications from the virus.</p>
<p>The average age of those infected in Ontario is 21.</p>
<p>Ontario's coroner's office is investigating Ruby's death to determine if she had any underlying health problems, but her family told the Star they aren't aware of any.</p>
<p>It's not known how she contracted the virus. Public health authorities said two members of the child's extended family had tested positive for mild cases of H1N1, but her mother, Kuldip Thindal, told the Star that this was news to them.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 14, Ruby had a slight fever and complained her legs and arms hurt. Fever and achy muscles can be symptoms of the flu. The next morning, Thindal took her to a walk-in clinic where a doctor prescribed the pain reliever Advil.</p>
<p>Thindal took Ruby back to the walk-in clinic that afternoon when the girl started complaining of stomach cramps - another flu symptom. This time she was given some pills.</p>
<p>Her stomach cramps abated but returned that evening. Meantime, the girl continued to ask her mother to massage her sore arms and legs.</p>
<p>Her parents drove her to hospital that evening, but the child suddenly died en route.</p>
<p>Ruby's death has shocked her family, who described her as a healthy and active girl.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam, of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, could not comment on this case specifically, but said it's not unheard of for flu symptoms to escalate quickly.</p>
<p>There have been 6,732 confirmed cases of the virus and 19 deaths in Canada to date, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. The ongoing increase is baffling public health officials, who expected the first wave of infections to decline ver the summer and be followed by a second wave in the fall.</p>
<p>"The first wave hasn't subsided. It's just increasing," Gardam said.</p>

<p>The deaths this week of two people in Ottawa from H1N1 flu fall within expected parameters, and more are likely to occur, said Dr. Jim Worthington, the Ottawa Hospital's vice-president of patient safety.</p>
<p>Addressing the hospital's board of governors' meeting Wednesday, Worthington said the deaths were to be "anticipated," noting that fatalities from H1N1 flu and related complications are to be expected in between three and five per cent of cases.</p>
<p>"Presently, the mortality rate seems to be less than one per cent," he said, "so we're probably just really at the start of this, and I think one needs to realize this is going to be a drawn-out process and there will be some stress on the system. Only time will tell how much stress that will be, but certainly at the moment, the hospital is managing and will continue to monitor the situation closely through the summer months."</p>
<p>Worthington added that the hospital was managing its pandemic response well. "There's been excellent communications between the hospital and Public Health ... and we've certainly managed the volume well through emergency departments.</p>
<p>"We're enforcing and reinforcing the aspects of good infection-control practices," he added, "early identification, isolation and hygeine, typical classic manoeuvres one would employ."</p>

<p>Coughing badly and sick from the H1N1 swine flu that likely has invaded her body, Susan Poulin is stuck in her house afraid and confused -- and feeling let down by public-health authorities.</p>
<p>After falling sick with flu-like symptoms last week, the Ottawa woman went to see a doctor Monday, who, after an examination, suspected Poulin had the H1N1 flu and promptly put her on the antiviral drug Tamiflu. Samples from her were sent for testing. Worried that she might have passed the virus to her husband Gord Borland, who has congenital heart disease and awaits a transplant, she sent him to the same doctor the next day and he was prescribed Tamiflu, too. Swabs were taken for testing as well. Three days later, Poulin, an economist who works for Service Canada, went to the clinic for her results only to be told that the samples hadn't been tested because the province no longer tests for H1N1.</p>
<p>She was horrified and flabbergasted, and everywhere she turned, Poulin could get no satisfactory answers.</p>
<p>"I feel like I have been left to dry. I am getting worse, but I don't know if I have this thing or not, and I feel that I have a right to know," Poulin said through violent bouts of coughing.</p>
<p>"It seems to me that the government made a decision that because they are getting hundreds of requests, and it is costing money, they are going to save money by not testing. At a time the World Health Organization is talking pandemic, saving money should not be the priority."</p>
<p>Poulin and Borland are bearing the brunt of a decision by Ontario public health authorities to stop mass H1N1 testing because it is no longer needed. Public-health officials say the tests were done in the initial stages of the outbreak to determine the behaviour of the virus in order to contain it. Once containment became futile as the virus spread through the community, it was pointless to continue testing.</p>
<p>"There really is no specific reason to do widespread testing anymore," Ottawa medical officer of health Dr. Isra Levy said last week. "Unlike the early days, when we were trying to get a handle on the epidemiology and understand whether and when there would be spread in the community, we now know with certainty that this virus is here."</p>
<p>That means the number of confirmed cases in the city will be difficult to determine even as the virus continues to spread and many people will be caught in the middle -- getting treatment, but not knowing for certain if they've been infected.</p>
<p>Poulin says it is "irresponsible" to just dismiss the impact on people like her and leave them with the psychological problem of wondering if they have a deadly flu or not.</p>
<p>"I have asthma, I am coughing my brains out and spitting and I find it pretty irresponsible for them to be doing this. I am worried about my husband because if he gets this, he is going to die," the 25-year public servant said.</p>
<p>Ottawa public health officials would not comment Tuesday. But Professor Earl Brown, a University of Ottawa virologist, said that while he sympathizes with Poulin, public health authorities are in a "tricky" situation, but have essentially made the right call in stopping tests.</p>
<p>He said testing is critical when little is known about a virus, but there is no longer much of a mystery about H1N1 and "testing doesn't add anything to the mix right now."</p>
<p>Brown doesn't rule out penny-pinching as one of the reasons for the government's decision, because budgets are being blown in hospitals and laboratories across the country to deal with the flu. But the bottom line is that people with suspected cases are being properly treated, he said, tests or no.</p>
<p>He said the Canadian approach right now is to reduce testing and treat suspected cases with Tamiflu, which is effective when administered within two days of symptoms.</p>
<p>"She is being treated with the best thing they've got to treat her and I think she should be assured there," Brown said. He said, however, that it would be helpful to have some counselling for people like Poulin and Borland to explain what is happening and put their minds at ease.</p>
<p>"I would think that there would be some discussion and a bit of counselling," Brown said.</p>
<p>So far, the H1N1 flu has killed seven people in Ontario and 2,556 confirmed cases have been formally recorded in the province. The number in Ottawa remains at 261.</p>

<p>An A/H1N1 swine flu outbreak has closed a ward at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.</p>
<p>The outbreak was declared on June 13 and involved three patients in the respiratory-illness unit on the sixth floor. One patient remains in hospital and two have been discharged, said Claire Tallarico, acting chief communications officer for the hospital.</p>
<p>The ward has had no new cases since the outbreak began nearly two weeks ago. If no new cases are found between now and tomorrow, the hospital will declare the outbreak over.</p>
<p>“We certainly believe it's under control. It's safe to come to St. Michael's,” said Matthew Muller, associate medical director of infection prevention and control.</p>
<p>According to ward-closing procedures, the unit has stopped accepting new patients. Those who are already on the ward have been quarantined until they no longer exhibit symptoms, Mr. Muller said.</p>
<p>“We didn't want to export our problem to other units or hospitals,” Mr. Muller said.</p>
<p>Patients have been asked to limit visitors to one at a time, and visitors are being asked to check in at the nursing station, where they are instructed about precautions, including washing hands before and after contact with patients, and wearing gloves, gowns, eye protection, and masks.</p>
<p>Patients and staff have also been given Tamiflu.</p>

<p>Fear sure ain't what it used to be.</p>
<p>North Korea's threat to “wipe the United States off the map” barely lasts a couple of hours on the Web until it's bounced down the page and eventually right off in favour of a truly terrifying story – the cost of parking in downtown Calgary.</p>
<p>But there you have it: Faster than U.S. President Barack Obama or Dear Leader Kim Jong-il can press the button, the world clicks its mouse and moves on.</p>
<p>A United States navy destroyer is tailing a North Korean ship thought to be transporting banned weapons, and the official Korean Central News Agency warns any interference will require them to “wipe out the aggressors on the globe once and for all.”</p>
<p>Yawn.</p>
<p>It is most difficult for those of us who were around – no matter at what age – in the late 1950s and early 1960s to comprehend how fear could come to this. Children remember school drills that had us cowering under our little desks. Adults remember backyards dug up for bomb shelters.</p>
<p>The Soviets were going to attack from outer space or Cuba – or else they were going to come over the North Pole and plow right through whatever defenceless community you lived in.</p>
<p>I used to sleep with a Daisy BB gun under the bed, just in case.</p>
<p>In Carp, Ont., the Government of Canada built a massive concrete bunker for the Prime Minister and vital cabinet ministers, just in case.</p>
<p>Whether it is the cause of racing media – 24-hour screaming on Fox and CNN, web pages rolling as fast as the screen can change, a revolution in Iran reduced to 140 characters – something has all but inured today's population to worrying about matters they can do nothing about anyway.</p>
<p>Besides, nothing ever seems to amount to the terror first promised in the news. We didn't all die from Legionnaires' disease, Lyme disease, West Nile, SARS and swine flu. Terribly sad that some have, but since nothing ever seems as bad as it did on first glance, why keep looking over your shoulder?</p>

<p>No doubt you're as outraged as most of the media by the latest scandal du jour, in which federal bureaucrats reportedly spent time -- perhaps even days -- debating whether to send alcohol-based hand sanitizer to native reserves to help fight swine flu because they were worried the alcohol might be abused.</p>
<p>Actually, the outrage isn't that bureaucrats behaved like bureaucrats. Being careful and covering their backsides is exactly what we expect and, when you come down to it, want bureaucrats to do. We tried cowboy bureaucrats during the Sponsorship Program and most of the country didn't much like the results.</p>
<p>Be honest. If you were in charge of making the hand-sanitizer decision, you might have done the same thing. Conscientious, well-informed bureaucrats will be aware of substance abuse on First Nations' reserves. They will have dutifully sat through TV reports about all manner of noxious products being used as intoxicants. And let's not be overly naive about the media here. If Ottawa had shipped off tankerloads of hand sanitizer and some enterprising reporter had got wind of even a small amount of it being diverted for, as they say, "inappropriate" use, the bureaucrats who acted promptly would have been publicly pilloried just as mercilessly as the bureaucrats who delayed are being now.</p>
<p>The scandal is not that bureaucrats behaved like bureaucrats. The scandal is that people in Ottawa are signing off on whether people living thousands of miles away get hand sanitizer. If you go on eBay and look under "Soap Dispensers, Restroom Supplies, and Bathroom Supplies," you get 183 hits on what look like the dispensers you see these days at every hospital entrance. We're not talking nuclear isotopes here. There's no worldwide shortage of sanitary hand sanitizer --if only because the private sector, not bureaucracy, produces it.</p>
<p>One report about Ottawa's dithering indicated that a native chief had got so frustrated waiting for hand sanitizer that never showed up he drove hundreds of kilometers to buy some himself. This was supposed to be an example of the problem's seriousness but in fact sounds like exactly the right response. Chiefs have budgets. Why don't chiefs, taking advice from public-health specialists if they like, make their own decisions whether to procure hand sanitizer for their communities? Or even leave such decisions to groups and individuals within the reserve?</p>
<p>True, FedEx may not ship to all reserves. But getting deliveries there and deciding what you're going to acquire in the first place are two different decisions. For the remotest reserves maybe there's an argument for government helping with transport. But government shouldn't be checking off on the shipping list.</p>
<p>If you treat people like children, don't be surprised if in the end they behave like children.</p>
<p>Lest you think that's a racist shot at native Canadians, exactly the same syndrome is working itself out at a popular children's medical clinic on the West Island of Montreal.</p>
<p>To keep expenses down, Quebec's Ministry of Health imposes surtaxes on physicians who make more than about $200,000 a year -- gross of expenses. What with swine flu and all, it's been a busy year for pediatricians. Some of those running the Tiny Tots Clinic apparently have already bumped up against their maximum income. As a result, they're now going to be paid at 25¢ on the dollar for all the services they provide between now and the end of the year. Think of it as a kind of Tax Freedom Day in reverse. Tax Freedom Day is when you've earned enough in the year to pay all your taxes and can then start working for yourself. But if you're a Quebec doctor, it works the other way around: As early as June, depending how hard you worked the first part of the year, you may start working almost entirely for the government.</p>
<p>Trouble is, 25¢ on the dollar doesn't pay the clinic's overhead. So the clinic has been restricting its hours while the doctors petition the Minister of Health for permission to be re-classified so they can keep working with full remuneration for the services they're providing.</p>
<p>What a bizarre country we live in. A doctor wants to treat a child. That child's parent wants the child treated. But if the doctor is to be paid for providing treatment, they have to await permission from the Minister of Health.</p>
<p>Native Canadians are falling ill and sanitary hand sanitizer would help them. But before they can get it they have to consult with federal bureaucrats.</p>
<p>It's obvious that both our health-care system and our approach to natives are suffering from a severe excess of paternalism. We're using the economic crisis as an excuse for rethinking all sorts of things. Why not these two systems? For Daddy clearly doesn't know best.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Coming clean in seconds --flat; Keyboard designed for multiple users</b>

<p>A computer keyboard that's cleaned with the wipe of a cloth across its touch-sensitive flat surface should click with customers in an increasingly germ-wary world, an Edmonton company believes.</p>
<p>CleanKeys is especially suited for hospitals, doctors' and dentists' offices, schools and other institutions where computers have multiple users, says marketing director Don McCormick.</p>
<p>Studies show that computer keyboards are a leading cause of the spread of infection in health-care facilities, says McCormick, a technology veteran who was asked to join the CleanKeys team by Randy Marsden, president of parent company Madenta.</p>
<p>The U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also warned that the swine flu virus could be spread through common touch surfaces such as computer keyboards, he says.</p>
<p>"It's perfect for any environment that has contamination of some kind. It takes seconds to spray it and wipe it down, while others in the market have a rubber coating that you have to immerse in water. And they still have key crevices where all kinds of things can get trapped."</p>
<p>CleanKeys has a glass or acrylic surface, with touch-sensitive keys that give an audible click for feedback. The sensitivity can be adjusted for people wearing gloves.</p>
<p>It's already attracting interest in the U. S. and Europe only 18 months after the first prototype came out, says McCormick.</p>
<p>CleanKeys was chosen as best new product at the 2007 American Dental Association conference, and two major U. S. dental-supply companies have signed up to distribute it. International distributors have also been lined up, mostly in Europe, he says.</p>
<p>CleanKeys retails for $399, which McCormick says is about in the middle range among similar products.</p>
<p>"It puts us in a favourable position with our closest competitors, and it's not an awful lot of money for that kind of protection."</p>
<p>They expect to be able to bring the unit cost down in the next 12 months or so as manufacturing ramps up, he says.</p>
<p>The problem is, the company needs to grow so it can develop a marketing and distribution system, and money's not exactly growing on trees right now.</p>
<p>So it's having its first investor session in Edmonton today. For information call 780-450-8926.</p>
<p>"It's not like developing software. To produce 5,000 of the keyboards, the manufacturer wants half a million dollars up front," McCormick says.</p>
<p>"There's a very broad market for it out there, and the only thing standing between us and success is money."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Macdonald Farm welcomes thousands; Award-winning facility open to public' Children can touch the animals and even get to milk a life-size plastic cow</b>

</p>
<p>More than 3,000 West Island children visited a farm last year, learning all about crops, chickens, cows, pigs and goats.</p>
<p>And they didn't even have to leave the island of Montreal to do it.</p>
<p>They went to the award-winning farm at the Macdonald campus of McGill University in Ste. Anne de Bellevue which has re-established tours of the site, after an eight-year break.</p>
<p>"There are many children removed from any connection to farm life whatsoever, no grandparents or uncles and aunts who have a farm. For them, milk comes in a carton and meat as a slab on a piece of styrofoam," said Paul Meldrum, director of the Macdonald Farm as a group of preschool children toured the century-old stone barn showcasing calves, chickens, ducks and goats for the children to see up close.</p>
<p>This year, because of a perceived danger due to the H1N1 virus, piglets are not included in the showcase.</p>
<p>"Because of a general misunderstanding about the virus, we just wanted to avoid any worry from parents," Meldrum said.</p>
<p>After a tractor-pulled hayride, the children were introduced to the farm's latest acquisition, a life-sized fibreglass cow, dubbed Magik, that is equipped with rubber teats and a bellyful of water.</p>
<p>"By sitting on a stool and milking Magik, children get the idea of the size and motion of milking, without the danger of getting kicked," Meldrum said as some of the children climbed a play tractor and cart next to the garden and picnic tables.</p>
<p>Like many of the things for children at the farm, the play equipment was built by an employee.</p>
<p>The award-winning farm, which is the only working dairy farm left on the island of Montreal, shows the children - adults are also welcome to visit in groups of at least 10 people - that milk comes from cows and that farm animals are not pets, but rather food-producing animals.</p>
<p>"This farm is a treasure. And it is nice to be able to share it," Meldrum said.</p>
<p>The farm was closed to visitors in 2000 when foot and mouth disease hit hard in England.</p>
<p>"It was highly contagious and carried by humans. Closing the farm to visitors was a precautionary measure because we didn't want to run the risk of the animals getting infected from someone who came from or had been in England."</p>
<p>Last year, the farm opened its doors to visitors once again, with guided tours for elementary and preschool and daycare children from May to the end of August. Besides the farm itself, visitors may also visit the Macdonald College museum, with artifacts dating back to 1907 when the college that taught agriculture, teaching and home sciences.</p>
<p>The farm has more than 3,000 laying hens as well as 40 pigs which are sent to market in Ontario, and 75 milking cows and, counting calves, a total herd of 150, including Holsteins, Ayrshire, Jersey, Brown Swiss and the rare Canadienne.</p>
<p>The Macdonald herd consistently ranks in the top one per cent of all herds for overall management, Meldrum proudly pointed out.</p>
<p>The milk, which has won awards for its purity, is sold to market, as are the eggs and pigs.</p>
<p>Meldrum said the path to great milk is to have good feed, clean stalls and equipment and, very importantly, comfortable cows, free of stress.</p>
<p>The 500-acre farm grows alfalfa, hay, wheat and corn, some of which go to the animals for feed, the rest to cash crops.</p>
<p>Entrance fee is $5. For more information on the farm and the guided tours, call 514-398-7701.</p>

<p>First nations chiefs in Manitoba called on the provincial and federal governments to declare a state of emergency on Wednesday because of the spread of swine flu on reserves and the lag time in responding to it. "With the H1N1 virus spreading rapidly through the communities and supplies taking nearly a month to be delivered, the First Nations people are at too much risk for this situation to continue any longer," Ron Evans, the grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, said in a statement. "We've had enough." The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs issued the plea for more help after meeting in Winnipeg and said there is a "rising sense of worry" about the looming fall flu season.</p>

<p>Manitoba's First Nations chiefs have declared a state of emergency and are urging the provincial and federal governments to do the same over the swine-flu pandemic. "Nobody wants to accept responsibility for First Nations," Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Ron Evans said in Winnipeg. The province announced the number of confirmed swine-flu cases in Manitoba had jumped by 163 to a total of 458. Roughly half of all confirmed cases are First Nations residents.</p>

<p>Ontario has confirmed another death associated with the H1N1 flu, bringing the known national total to 21. A 68-year-old man from Durham Region, east of Toronto, tested positive for the H1N1 flu virus. On Tuesday, local health officials confirmed that a 17-year-old boy from the Ottawa region and a 52-year-old woman from eastern Ontario had also tested positive. Yesterday, the province said it's not clear what role swine flu played in those three fatalities. Ontario now has seven deaths associated with H1N1 flu and more than 2,665 cases. Across Canada, there have been more than 5,700 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus, with most of the cases considered mild.</p>

<p>The federal government's handling of the swine-flu outbreak on native reserves in Manitoba is an appalling case of bureaucratic bungling that not only insulted residents of stricken communities but also placed their lives at risk. Beyond the specifics of this sad saga, however, lies the additional concern that Canadians have now seen a demonstration of the government's ability to respond quickly and professionally to a crisis-level flu outbreak – and the evidence is worrying for all of us.</p>
<p>A Senate committee on aboriginal peoples heard testimony on Tuesday that residents of remote fly-in communities in Manitoba waited 2½ weeks for emergency supplies – including flu masks and respirators – while officials apparently dithered about the inclusion of hand sanitizer in the shipments. As a mild outbreak grew quickly into a crisis, health officials spent days debating the merits of sanitizers with or without alcohol, worrying the alcohol-based brands could be consumed by people with addictions.</p>
<p>Chief David Harper of the Garden Hill First Nation revealed he flew to Winnipeg to buy supplies himself and then went to Ottawa to plead with officials for help. He finally received 2,500 bottles of sanitizer, but noted he still got the alcohol-based product anyway, for his dry community.</p>
<p>Swine flu clearly poses a huge risk in vulnerable aboriginal communities with limited health care resources, crowded living conditions and, in some cases, chronic problems with water quality and sanitation. Under such circumstances, it is hard to imagine it would require two weeks of deliberation to conclude that those factors must surely outweigh the risk that some addicts might temporarily misuse hand sanitizer during an outbreak. The fact that alternative non-alcohol products also exist only makes the slow decision-making process more confusing.</p>
<p>But given the government's long track record of patronizing decisions and delayed reforms on aboriginal reserves, it is far from shocking to hear about another initiative gone awry. Indeed, it's easy to imagine that some in Ottawa could see a two-week response as unusually quick action on an emerging problem. And in other situations, it might be.</p>
<p>But with a crisis as fast-moving as the spreading of H1N1, communities with severe outbreaks cannot wait weeks for help. When the World Health Organization moved earlier this month to declare a flu pandemic, the Canadian government issued an assurance the same day that it was prepared to implement its $1-billion Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan to protect the public. If this case is a demonstration of the plan's effectiveness, however, Canadians are not impressed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hog producers to get cash help - But advances may come too late for some</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch </div>
<div>701 words</div><div>24 June 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>Financially strapped Manitoba hog producers will qualify for federal-provincial cash advances totalling $37.7 million in the coming weeks, Agriculture Minister Rosann Wowchuk said Tuesday.</p>
<p>But the head of the Manitoba Pork Council, which lobbies on behalf of hog producers, questioned how much good that will do for what he called an industry in "crisis."</p>
<p>Wowchuk said the two levels of government agreed late Monday to advance payments under the federal-provincial AgriStability farm income support program.</p>
<p>Hog producers should see cash from the program paid to them later this summer instead of having to wait until sometime in 2010, she said.</p>
<p>But pork council president Karl Kynoch said Tuesday the program is flawed and will likely fail to adequately assist many farmers.</p>
<p>"That $37 million will help out some of the producers, but still it's going to be two months before they get it. That's too long," the Baldur hog farmer said. "We have a cash liquidity problem. We have to get cash into producers' hands now," he said, adding farmers are going out of business "every week."</p>
<p>"Our industry is in an absolute critical state that is on the verge of collapse," Jurgen Preugschas, chairman of the Canadian Pork Council echoed Tuesday. "The losses are just adding up and the sustainability of our industry as we know it is in major jeopardy."</p>
<p>Manitoba is one of the largest producers in a national industry that's been bleeding red ink for going on three years. In that time, hog farmers have suffered due to currency fluctuations, a doubling of feed grain prices and adverse American food labelling laws.</p>
<p>But the knock-out punch for many was the North American outbreak of H1N1 influenza, referred to by many as the "swine flu." That led to several overseas pork customers closing their borders to Canadian and American suppliers, which has in turn eroded prices.</p>
<p>"What really, really pushed us over the edge here this summer is this H1N1 being misnamed," said Kynoch.</p>
<p>He estimated the fallout from H1N1 alone has cost Manitoba producers between $3 million and $4 million a week.</p>
<p>Before that, hog producers were actually looking forward this summer to their first profits in a couple of years. But those hopes have been dashed.</p>
<p>Local producers have begged the province for direct aid and have helped lead a national push for a federal bailout in the order of $800 million to $1 billion. Manitoba would have qualified for some $200 million of that because of the size of its industry.</p>
<p>But so far, they've been turned down.</p>
<p>The industry staged a rally in Morris Monday evening that it estimates drew between 500 and 600 farmers, hog farm employees, suppliers, lenders and politicians.</p>
<p>Kynoch said he's disappointed no one from the Doer government attended. Several Tory MLAs, including party leader Hugh McFadyen, showed up, as did the federal Liberal agriculture critic, Wayne Easter from Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>"Everybody except the NDP (attended)," Kynoch said.</p>
<p>Provincial hog producers want Manitoba to match a Saskatchewan program in which producers received $20 per market hog and $10 per weanling pig sold. Alberta, Ontario and Quebec have also offered direct aid to their producers.</p>
<p>But Manitoba has refused, citing possible trade sanctions from the United States, Kynoch said.</p>
<p>Although she didn't attend the Morris rally, Wowchuk spoke with Kynoch on the telephone twice on Monday, including late in the day to tell him of the $37.7 million in advance payments.</p>
<p>Wowchuk said farmers will be getting notices in the next couple of weeks telling them how much money they will be qualified to receive. All they have to do is "check a box" on a form and return it to receive their advance, she said.</p>
<p>She said she's also offered to discuss other ways in which the province can assist hog producers.</p>
<p>"This is an important industry, and we want to be sure that there's cash to help them through this difficult time," Wowchuk said.</p>

</p>
<p>Within minutes, 6-year-old Rubjit Thindal went from happily chatting in the backseat of the car to collapsing and dying in her father's arms.</p>
<p>"If we had known it was so serious, we would have called 911," Kuldip Thindal, Rubjit's distraught mother, said in Punjabi yesterday. "She just had a stomach ache - she wasn't even crying."</p>
<p>Rubjit was pronounced dead at hospital barely 24 hours after showing signs of a fever. Later, doctors told her parents she had the H1N1 influenza virus, also known as swine flu. She is believed to be the youngest person in Canada with the virus to have died.</p>
<p>On the evening of June 14, Rubjit had a bit of a fever and complained that her legs and arms hurt. The next morning, Kuldip took her to a walk-in clinic on McLaughlin Rd. and the doctor prescribed the pain reliever Advil.</p>
<p>By the afternoon, the little girl's fever was gone but she was complaining of a stomach ache.</p>
<p>Kuldip took her to the clinic again at about 2 p.m. The doctor gave her pills and told the Grade 1 student at Roberta Bondar School in Brampton to take it easy. She was fine for a bit, said Kuldip, but she kept asking "me to massage her arms and legs."</p>
<p>In the evening, when Rubjit said her stomach was still hurting, Kuldip and her husband, Gurmukh, decided to take her immediately to Georgetown Hospital.</p>
<p>Kuldip was driving. It was about 8 p.m. and they were five minutes from the hospital. Rubjit sat in the backseat with her dad, talking - as usual - and sipping apple juice.</p>
<p>A minute later, Rubjit suddenly put her hand on her chest and said it was hurting.</p>
<p>The next minute, her body went limp and she stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Gurmukh performed CPR while Kuldip raced into the hospital's parking lot.</p>
<p>It was about 8: 05 p.m. when they arrived, Kuldip remembers. Two hours later, doctors confirmed their little girl was dead.</p>
<p>The exact cause of her death has not yet been determined, but the virus is known to have been a contributing factor, Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, told a news conference Monday.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is having a greater impact on young people. The average age of the 2,665 Ontarians infected with the virus is 21.</p>
<p>Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, explained that older people are more likely to have built up antibodies to fight the virus by having been infected with or vaccinated against similar strains in the past.</p>
<p>Rubjit's parents say they don't know where the little girl contracted the virus. The entire family has been tested and Kuldip said doctors have told them no one else has it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Kuldip's daughter, Harmeen, 13, sat next to her. Her son, Gagan, 10, was on the computer watching videos of his sister singing and dancing to Punjabi music.</p>
<p>"She loved dressing up and having her photograph taken," he said.</p>
<p>The little girl would have turned 7 on Aug. 29. She asked her aunt in India to send her a blue salwar-kameez, a traditional Punjabi dress, and blue bangles for her birthday.</p>
<p>On the weekend, Kuldip bought a blue salwar-kameez and matching bangles for her daughter's funeral.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alcohol worries kept hand sanitizers off reserves; Manitoba communities hard hit by spread of swine flu virus</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>470 words</div><div>24 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Federal officials spent days debating whether to send hand sanitizers to First Nations communities struggling with swine flu outbreaks because of their alcohol content, a Senate committee heard Tuesday.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizers were among the supplies in nursing stations on some of the reserves that have been hard-hit by the illness, but chiefs wanted them available in the wider community because many homes lack running water. Frequent hand washing with soap and water as a protective measure against the spread of the swine flu, also called the H1N1 virus, was therefore not an option for those residents.</p>
<p>Manitoba Senator Sharon Carstairs and the Assembly of First Nations' senior public health adviser, Dr. Kim Barker, said during the Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples meeting that the need for hand sanitizers and other supplies was critical in the remote northern Manitoba communities of Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point, yet they took so long to arrive that one chief eventually drove hundreds of kilometres to buy them himself.</p>
<p>Anne-Marie Robinson, assistant deputy minister for the First Nations and Inuit Health branch of Health Canada, told the committee there was "some difficulty" in procuring the hand sanitizers that some chiefs asked for, but they were now available.</p>
<p>She later confirmed to the committee that there were discussions "with chiefs and amongst our public health officials" about alcohol-based sanitizer products. She said there have been "rare" cases in which hand sanitizers had become problematic in some communities where people had alcohol addictions.</p>
<p>"For the vast majority of people it's not an issue, but ... that discussion was had with the best interest of our clients in mind, and we have now distributed hand sanitizers," Robinson said.</p>
<p>Robinson testified that hand sanitizer was being distributed door-to-door in Garden Hill, an island community about 600 kilometres north of Winnipeg, and had also been made available in nearby St. Theresa Point. Both communities have had hundreds of residents fall sick with flu symptoms since May and nearly 150 people have been flown by air ambulance to Winnipeg for treatment.</p>
<p>Carstairs blamed the discussion over alcohol-based products for the delay in getting sanitizer to the Manitoba communities and said she was "horrified" when she learned about it.</p>
<p>"I think it's another example of the paternalistic attitude in which aboriginal people are treated," she said.</p>
<p>Barker said she was similarly distraught by the debate.</p>
<p>"We heard that argument as well, that people were sitting down spending days discussing the pros and cons of a non-alcohol-based hand sanitizer versus an alcohol-based one because of the concerns around addictions in communities ... absolutely outrageous, quite frankly," she told the committee.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Give Air Canada credit: It's become a much better airline</b>
</div><div>JEFFREY SIMPSON </div>
<div>728 words</div><div>24 June 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 </div>
</p>
<p>Times are tough in this recession for lots of industries, but times always seem to be tough for the airline business.</p>
<p>To crib a phrase, it's just one damn thing after another. Just when a company starts feeling a tad comfortable, bang, along comes recession, high fuel prices, SARS or swine flu, 9/11, border hassles, new passport rules, higher airport landing charges (Pearson International, take a bow), a highly publicized crash or two.</p>
<p>Air Canada's management and its five unions, however, have just defied predictions of strife and settled their differences. No lockouts. No strikes. No work to rule. Rather, management imposed some hardship on itself, and the unions acted in a correspondingly reasonable fashion.</p>
<p>The result should help Air Canada borrow the money it needs – about $600-million – to stay above the minimum cash balance required by a credit-card processor, and to avoid (at least for a while) heading into bankruptcy protection for the second time in six years. Who knows what the future holds, what with the downturn in revenues from the recession?</p>
<p>Three years ago, a rant (Air Canada Doesn't Give A Damn. I'll Fly WestJet – June 10, 2006) appeared in this space lambasting Air Canada, calling it the company Canadians most loved to hate. An avalanche of supportive communications followed, some of which were duly forwarded to the president of Air Canada, Monte Brewer, who, to his credit, had written a reasoned response to the rant.</p>
<p>Without taking a thing back from what was then written, it should now be said that Air Canada is a much better airline than three or four years ago, even though its balance sheet looks horrible.</p>
<p>Air Canada's staff had been put through the wringer. The morale problems were almost entirely management's fault, starting with then-CEO Robert Milton. The nickel-and-diming, the battered aircraft, the inflexibility of rules, the outsourcing of work (baggage information got rerouted through India), depressed wages and other decisions had demoralized staff.</p>
<p>Employees were on the front lines dealing with unhappy passengers. Who could blame the staff for not going the extra mile, as it were? Times were often tough, but insensitive management made them tougher.</p>
<p>One of the reasons for that sorry state of affairs – there are many – was the rapacious way <span class="companylink">Cerberus Capital Management</span> of New York, and the other investors in <span class="companylink">ACE Aviation Holdings Inc</span>., grabbed quick profits from the breakup of Air Canada's operations – a breakup, or “restructuring,” engineered by Mr. Milton (who greatly enriched himself in the process).</p>
<p>By spinning off Aeroplan and Jazz, two profitable arms of the previous Air Canada structure, the airline was left to fend for itself in an industry that had known more losses than profits. This arrangement was profitable for the Aeroplan and Jazz operations, but not for Air Canada, and the results are clearly in evidence today.</p>
<p>Yes, Aeroplan buys seats from Air Canada for its frequent flyers, but it does not contribute profits to the airline, and profits are what Air Canada needs. Yes, Air Canada hedged on the price of aviation fuel and paid too much, but who among us expected the collapse of prices that occurred last fall/winter?</p>
<p>Employees, their unions having taken shares and agreed to deferred contributions by Air Canada to their pension plan, are now in for a penny and, therefore, in for a pound, so to speak. They are owners, and that should create a more co-operative environment.</p>
<p>Co-operation should also be enhanced by management's decision to impose economic sacrifices on themselves, something far too few executives do. (See continuing lucrative severance payments, hefty salaries and stock options.)</p>
<p>Sure, the proverbial happens with airlines. No doubt the proverbial still happens, and passengers are only too happy to record it in their memories. Forgetting bad things takes a long time, whereas it's easy to forget when things unfold as they should.</p>
<p>There are still ways Air Canada could make passengers happier, such as recompensing them for flights delayed by more than, say, three hours when the delay is the airline's fault.</p>
<p>For some Canadians, Air Canada will remain the company they most love to hate. Others recognize improvement and are happy to record it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How to keep a lid on investing stress</b>
</div><div>John Heinzl </div>
<div>805 words</div><div>24 June 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 </div>
</p>
<p>Hands up anyone who would like more stress in his or her life.</p>
<p>Nobody? Didn't think so.</p>
<p>Fact is, with jobs, kids and BlackBerrys competing for our attention, we all feel overwhelmed from time to time. And that's before factoring in bonus stresses like garbage strikes and swine flu outbreaks.</p>
<p>So why would anyone want their investments to add to their stress levels? The good news is they don't have to. In the spirit of promoting harmony, balance and kick-ass portfolio returns, here are five ways to reduce investing stress.</p>
<p>Deep breath, everyone. Now let's begin.</p>
<p>1 STOP TRADING</p>
<p>SO MUCH</p>
<p>Overtrading is one of the surest ways to crank up your stress level – and hurt your portfolio returns. If the transaction costs don't kill you, the temptation to buy at market peaks and sell at market bottoms will.</p>
<p>According to a study by University of California finance professors Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, active traders underperformed the market by nearly seven percentage points. “Our central message is that trading is hazardous to your wealth,” they wrote.</p>
<p>It's far better – both for your emotional and financial well-being – to buy and hold high-quality stocks whose earnings and dividends rise over time.</p>
<p>2 STOP CHECKING</p>
<p>YOUR PORTFOLIO</p>
<p>EVERY FIVE MINUTES</p>
<p>Watching your portfolio like a hawk may seem like the responsible thing to do, but it's a recipe for stress. Why? It has to do with basic math, and the way the human brain processes winning and losing.</p>
<p>In his book, Fooled by Randomness, Nassim Taleb provides a good illustration. Suppose your portfolio generates an average return of 15 per cent and has volatility of 10 per cent annually. Given these assumptions, your portfolio has a 93-per-cent chance of rising in any given year.</p>
<p>Problem is, the more frequently you check your returns, the lower the odds are that you'll be up. That's because, even though stocks rise over the long term, returns are highly unpredictable in the short term.</p>
<p>In any given quarter, for instance, there's a 77-per-cent chance of gains. In any month, the odds fall to 67 per cent. And if you check your stocks every hour, the probability of being up is just 51.3 per cent. In other words, you'll be disappointed roughly half the time.</p>
<p>Now consider this: Research has shown that people experience more emotional pain from a financial loss than joy from a financial gain. So if you check your stocks often, you're going to be stressed out a lot of the time. And in a bear market, you'll be downright miserable.</p>
<p>3 FIND A BALANCE</p>
<p>This is one of the simplest – and most powerful – investing strategies. Ask yourself how much risk you can tolerate, and then build a portfolio accordingly. For aggressive (or younger) investors, it may be 70-per-cent stocks and 30-per-cent fixed income. For conservative (or older) investors, those numbers might be reversed. Once you find the mix that's right for you, stick with it. That means rebalancing every so often to keep your percentages in line, which is less stressful than trying to guess which way the market is heading.</p>
<p>4 WRITE AN</p>
<p>INVESTMENT POLICY STATEMENT</p>
<p>In his book, Optimal Investing, Scott Frush writes: “Much like a blueprint for building a house, an investment policy statement serves as the blueprint for building your optimal portfolio.”</p>
<p>The idea is to put your investing goals, and how you intend to achieve them, in writing so you won't do something impulsive. When financial markets come unglued, you can pull your statement out of the drawer and read it, instead of acting emotionally and deviating from your plan.</p>
<p>Your statement can include such information as how much you intend to invest every month, what your target asset allocation is between stocks, bonds and other investments, and what your philosophy is regarding risk.</p>
<p>You can find a worksheet at http://im.morningstar.com/im/InvestPolicyWS.pdf [http://im.morningstar.com/im/InvestPolicyWS.pdf].</p>
<p>5 BUY INDEX ETFS</p>
<p>Most mutual funds trail the market, largely because of fees that eat into their returns. The easiest way to achieve diversification – without the hefty fees – is to buy an exchange-traded fund such as the iShares CDN LargeCap 60 Index Fund. With a management expense ratio of just 0.17 per cent, you'll eliminate the stress of paying a fund manager to generate mediocre returns. What's more, if you find it stressful to monitor a portfolio of individual stocks, owning a diversified ETF or two will solve that problem, too.</p>
<p>So do yourself a favour and ditch the stress. Your portfolio will thank you.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stelmach hints at more royalty breaks; Natural Gas Announcement Imminent; Beleaguered gas drillers given hope</b>
</div><div>Dan Healing And Darcy Henton, With Files From Renata
D'aliesio, Calgary Herald </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>783 words</div><div>24 June 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>E1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald </div>
</p>
<p>In the face of grim provincial drilling numbers and growing interest in shale gas development south of the border, Premier Ed Stelmach hinted Tuesday that the province will offer more royalty breaks to companies drilling for natural gas.</p>
<p>The premier said he's meeting with the energy industry later this week and "we'll be making some announcements."</p>
<p>The Alberta government is expected to extend temporary royalty breaks on drilling that were slated to end in March. Final details are still being worked out, but government sources said Tuesday an announcement could come as soon as this week in Calgary.</p>
<p>Stelmach warned new technology that has resulted in major shale gas discoveries in the southern United States threatens the financial lifeblood of Alberta--royalties from natural gas.</p>
<p>Last week, the U. S. Potential Gas Committee, a non-profit organization that evaluates American natural gas reserves every two years, reported that U. S. natural gas supply has increased by 35 per cent, due in large part to shale gas coming on line.</p>
<p>"There are serious economic issues Alberta will be facing over the next couple of years that are more than just the general economic recession around the world," the premier said. "Right now I am so focused on preparing Alberta for the next few years because there are dark clouds ahead if we don't respond to the changing economic climate."</p>
<p>The energy sector has been lobbying the government to extend its one-year drilling incentive programs, which took effect April 1.</p>
<p>The incentives, which were projected to cost the province $1.5 billion, offer a $200-per-metre royalty drilling credit for new conventional oil and gas wells, as well as a maximum five per cent royalty rate for the first year of production on new wells.</p>
<p>Don Herring, president of the Canadian Association of Oilwell Drilling Contractors, said the industry wants more than tinkering with royalty incentives. It is calling for a permanent solution that makes Alberta competitive with other jurisdictions.</p>
<p>"Quite frankly, the problem the program has right now is that commodity prices -- natural gas prices -- are quite low," Herring said, adding the association plans to reduce its 2009 drilling forecast Thursday.</p>
<p>The drilling group last revised its projections in February to 11,176 wells, about one-third less than last year. As of June 16, only 68 of 604 rigs were drilling in Alberta, a sign of the dramatic slowdown gripping the sector.</p>
<p>"Drilling is bad," Herring said, "bad and getting worse."</p>
<p>Gary Leach of Small Explorers and Producers Association of Canada said the industry has been talking to the province about extending the "fuse" on incentives scheduled to end in March --the drilling incentive and drilling royalty tax credit. However, he said he hasn't been provided details of the government's plans.</p>
<p>"We have been gently trying to determine the appetite of the government to extending those incentives," he said. "This would be a welcome signal to industry."</p>
<p>Leach noted a number of companies announced they would spend more money drilling in Alberta after the Stelmach government introduced the program in March, and several said the moves made the province's royalties competitive with B. C.'s programs. However, "B. C. doesn't have a time limit on its incentives; Alberta does."</p>
<p>Roman Cooney, a spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, noted there have been many discussions between industry and government in recent weeks, but said he didn't have details of coming changes.</p>
<p>"It's fair to say the premier and ministers have been listening in following some of the key trends in the industry, particularly with respect to the U. S. shale gas (growth)," Cooney said.</p>
<p>Paul Ziff, CEO of Ziff Energy, said his company noticed a downturn in Alberta natural gas exploration even before the recession hit and well before the province announced a new royalty rate structure. But he said the Stelmach government chose to heed a much rosier scenario forecast by another consulting firm.</p>
<p>"Royalties on gas were based on poor or flawed data and also looking too much in the rear view instead of where things were headed," he said. "Talk about shooting the golden goose. The goose is in intensive care with the swine flu."</p>

<p>The number of deaths linked to the swine flu outbreak continued to climb in Canada on Tuesday, with two more deaths reported in each of Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>The total in Quebec is now 11, with five in Ontario. Across the country, there have been 19 deaths reported related to swine flu.</p>
<p>The Quebec Public Health Department said Tuesday the two patients who died from the illness there--a man in his 50s and a woman in her 60s -- had significant underlying health conditions, as has often been the case in Canada.</p>
<p>They lived in the regions of Quebec City and Chaudiere-Appalaches, the department said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an Ottawa teenager with chronic health problems was one of two eastern Ontarians to die with H1N1 swine flu in the last few days. The teen died at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>In the last few days, a 52-year-old woman from the Ottawa Valley who had tested positive for H1N1 flu died at the Ottawa Hospital, Levy said.</p>

<p>Manitoba farmer Karl Kynoch says countries have used the flu as an excuse to cut off Canadian imports.</p>
<p>He says that's led to a backlog of pork, which is selling at low prices.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>Producers say Canada's pork industry is on the brink of collapse and desperately needs at least $800 million from the federal government if hog farmers are going to survive.</p>
<p>They say they have been hit by high feed prices, a strong Canadian dollar and now swine flu -- making it virtually impossible for some to stay afloat.</p>
<p>"Our industry is in an absolute critical state that is on the verge of collapse," Jurgen Preugschas, chairman of the Canadian Pork Council, said yesterday. "The losses are just adding up and the sustainability of our industry as we know it is in major jeopardy."</p>
<p>Farmers have been losing money on their hogs for several years. Feed prices skyrocketed in 2007. At the same time, the Canadian loonie soared, battering an industry that exports two out of every three pigs.</p>
<p>Then the United States brought in "country-of-origin labelling" legislation, which dictates that certain agricultural commodities, including pork, must state where they came from. Some farmers blame the law for falling exports to the south.</p>
<p>Just when pork producers thought they were going to start posting profits again, they were hit with the new H1N1 virus known as swine flu, Preugschas said.</p>
<p>"Our prices have totally collapsed. Our producers are losing $40 to $50 a pig again," said Preugschas, who added some people can't afford to pay their feed bills.</p>
<p>"If they get foreclosed upon, they not only lose their jobs. They lose their farms and they lose their homes."</p>
<p>Pork producers need government help now, he said. The industry generates more than $7 billion for the Canadian economy and is responsible for 42,000 jobs on the export side alone, he added.</p>
<p>It will take at least $800 million -- about $30 per pig -- to help hog farmers weather the storm in the short term, Preugschas suggested.</p>
<p>The Canadian Federation of Agriculture calls the pork crisis an "extraordinary situation" that needs immediate help from Ottawa.</p>
<p>Federation president Laurent Pellerin said hog farmers are used to fluctuating prices but he's never seen them stay this low for years at a time. If the federal government doesn't step in with some help, it "will be a disaster."</p>
<p>"We are looking at a package that will put some liquidity in the hands of the farmers," said Pellerin, a pork and beef producer in Trois-Rivières, Que.</p>
<p>"If we don't do that, a lot more will go out of business."</p>
<p>A spokesperson said Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz was travelling yesterday and unavailable for an interview.</p>
<p>His office issued an e-mailed statement saying the government understands "pork producers are facing some real challenges."</p>
<p>But paying hog farmers $30 a pig would do little to help because it could spark a trade challenge, the statement said.</p>
<p>"Per-head payments are counterproductive because Canadian pork producers depend on export markets and trade retaliation would cause more harm than good."</p>
<p>That's little consolation to Manitoba farmer Karl Kynoch, who doesn't expect to make any money for at least another 10 months.</p>
<p>In a province where there are more pigs than people, Kynoch said it doesn't make sense to bail out other struggling industries and ignore pork producers.</p>
<p>A collapse of the pork industry would have a ripple effect on meat-packers, truckers and even veterinarians, he predicted.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of spinoff jobs that are going to disappear going forward," said Kynoch, head of Manitoba's pork council. "We've seen help go to the auto industry, help go to the forest industry. There really isn't anything for hog producers."</p>
<p>George Matheson, a Manitoba hog farmer, said he understands a bailout could provoke the ire of some of Canada's trading partners. But the situation is so dire it may just be worth it, he suggested.</p>
<p>"We have to try and get this ad-hoc payment just so that people can make it literally until next week.</p>
<p>"It's a double-edged sword. You're going to pay for it but, at the same time, at least you'll stay in production."</p>

<p>Federal officials spent days debating whether to send hand sanitizers to First Nations communities struggling with swine flu outbreaks because of their alcohol content, a Senate committee heard yesterday.</p>
<p>Anne-Marie Robinson, assistant deputy minister for the First Nations and Inuit Health branch of Health Canada, told the committee there was "some difficulty" in procuring the hand sanitizer that some chiefs were asking for but that it is now available.</p>
<p>She later confirmed to the committee that there were discussions "with chiefs and amongst our public health officials" about alcohol-based sanitizer products. She said there have been "rare" cases when hand sanitizer has been problematic in some communities where people have alcohol addictions.</p>
<p>"We've had a number of people come forward and some evidence where this could potentially put people at risk," said Robinson. "For the vast majority of people it's not an issue but . . . that discussion was had with the best interest of our clients in mind and we have now distributed hand sanitizers."</p>

<p>The number of northerners showing signs of flu-like illness appears to have levelled off in the past few days, a senior Manitoba Health official said Monday.</p>
<p>"It seems to be calmer than it was in the last couple of weeks. We're not exactly sure why that is," said Gerry Delorme, director of the department's office of disaster management, adding epidemiologists are looking into the causes.</p>
<p>Delorme said it is too early to conclude that the incidence of H1N1 is subsiding in the North. But he said his office's analysis, based on information received over the weekend, "looks positive right now."</p>
<p>Northern regional health authorities have experienced a disproportionate share of confirmed cases of H1N1. As of Friday, 104 of the 295 confirmed cases in Manitoba were from the Burntwood/Churchill and Nor-Man RHAs in the North.</p>
<p>Authorities cite poor living conditions, including a lack of housing and running water, for the greater incidence of the virus in northern communities.</p>
<p>Before addressing a training session for officials from northern First Nations in Winnipeg on Monday, Delorme said the optimistic analysis was based on nursing station traffic, the number of ground and air ambulance transfers, emergency-room activity and lab-confirmed cases.</p>
<p>"When we see less people coming into a nursing station with influenza-like illnesses, it probably means that there is less of it in the community," he said.</p>
<p>"We're still seeing cases but not nearly as many as we were last week."</p>
<p>Sydney Garrioch, grand chief of Manitoba Keewatinook Ininew Okimowin (MKO), a group of the 30 northern First Nations, questioned the analysis.</p>
<p>"From our perspective, we don't feel it (the situation) is stable," Garrioch said, although he noted that he had not yet seen a report summarizing the weekend.</p>
<p>Traffic at northern nursing stations seemed to be escalating last week, he said.</p>
<p>Garrioch said despite government assurances, there is still a shortage of doctors and nurses in the North to deal with the H1N1 outbreak. He said he is also concerned at what appears to be a lack of supplies at nursing stations. He said one nursing station didn't have enough children's Advil or Tylenol last week to give to young people who had fevers.</p>
<p>"That's just a basic item," Garrioch said.</p>
<p>Also of concern to MKO, which represents 56,000 people, is the lack of hand sanitizers at the Thompson airport and at that city's malls. The organization said some public washrooms also lack soap. "The communities are preparing (for a pandemic) at the community level but they wonder (if) the businesses in the urban centres (are) preparing?" said Kevin Carlson, Garrioch's assistant.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Senators to probe H1N1 outbreak - Lack of planning a key consideration</b>
</div><div>By Mia Rabson </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Public health officials will be asked this morning to shed light on the flu outbreak on reserves in Manitoba and northwestern Ontario.</p>
<p>Officials from Health Canada, the Public Health Agency of Canada and the Assembly of First Nations are all scheduled to testify at a hearing of the Senate's standing committee on aboriginal peoples</p>
<p>Manitoba Senator Sharon Carstairs, who pushed for the hearing to take place, said she wants to send the message that there are people concerned about it, even if the isotope shortage and employment insurance have trumping recent political news.</p>
<p>"It hasn't had the kind of publicity it deserves," Carstairs said.</p>
<p>She said she was really disturbed about the lack of pandemic planning in place before the outbreak, noting the medivac flights that flew ill people out of communities without having proper infection control in place, or the lack of hand sanitizers available to communities with hundreds of sick people.</p>
<p>"There doesn't seem to have been a recognition this is a different species of animal because of all the other problems on reserves," Carstairs said.</p>
<p>She said the fact chiefs from Manitoba were just getting pandemic management training this week shows just how far behind reserves are in pandemic planning.</p>
<p>She'd also like to ask questions about whether the vaccine for H1N1 will be prioritized for First Nations once it's developed, and whether First Nations should be used as a test to see if giving out Tamiflu to people who have no symptoms can help stem an outbreak.</p>
<p>H1N1, as with other flu viruses, is riskier for people who are already in poor health.</p>
<p>The conditions on many remote northern reserves -- including poor housing, overcrowding, high rates of chronic illnesses, poverty, poor nutrition and the lack of running water and sewers -- are believed to have contributed to making certain communities more susceptible to H1N1.</p>
<p>St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill have been particularly hard hit.</p>
<p>Live audio of the Senate hearing, which begins at 8:30 a.m. Winnipeg time, should be available online at http://senparlvu.parl.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/Guide.aspx [http://senparlvu.parl.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/Guide.aspx].</p>

</div><div>Vaughn Palmer </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

<p>The votes were still being tallied from the provincial election when David Schreck, the former New Democratic Party MLA and all-round gadfly, launched a fishing expedition into the murky waters surrounding the B.C. Liberal government.</p>
<p>The Liberals had skipped the monthly release of welfare statistics during the campaign. Schreck figured they were hiding something. So he filed a request for all e-mails dealing with the decision to hold off.</p>
<p>This was May 14. Next morning the missing stats were posted on the government website, two weeks late and showing a 47-per-cent jump in the number of people receiving welfare.</p>
<p>"I think it is likely that someone in the premier's office or the public affairs bureau instructed those responsible for the statistics not to release the figures until after the election," Schreck mused on his own StrategicThoughts website.</p>
<p>Good guess. The sought-after e-mails were released to Schreck last week, passed by him to the New Democrats and made public by them on Monday.</p>
<p>The two dozen or so missives showed that the social services ministry was indeed preparing to release the welfare stats on the usual date. But it was stopped short by a request-cum-directive from the public affairs bureau. "Can we please hold off on posting these updates until after the election."</p>
<p>As to the reason for holding back, a ministry official confided that it was "because of the requirement to not post information to the Internet during the interregnum period."</p>
<p>The reference to the interregnum echoed a directive from the head of the public service, Jessica McDonald, laying out how government should operate in a "caretaker mode" through the period from the issuing of the election writ on April 14 to election day May 12.</p>
<p>"This means that the public service is to avoid implementing major new policy initiatives or entering into new commitments that might bind an incoming administration," she wrote. "Overall it is the role of the professional public servant to provide the stability and continuity of government services during this interregnum period, and serving the public to the best of our ability remains our first priority."</p>
<p>McDonald left it to "ministry executives" to spell out the details. But within the government communications division, the public affairs bureau, her directive was interpreted as requiring a minimalist approach to the release of information.</p>
<p>So says the newly appointed cabinet member in charge of the bureau, Citizens' Services Minister Ben Stewart. I spoke to him briefly Monday and began by asking how the welfare stats came to be "suppressed."</p>
<p>Suppressed? That, said Stewart, was "a stronger word than we'd like."</p>
<p>I'm sure. But what was his explanation for the decision to withhold news of an almost 50-per-cent increase in the welfare caseload?</p>
<p>Stewart said the public affairs bureau decided as a matter of policy to hold back good news as well as bad during the election. The only releases were those mandated by law or dictated by the needs of public health. "They were completely dealing with public safety in terms of press releases."</p>
<p>The handful of government press releases from the four-week campaign period supports his claim. Four dealt with the swine flu outbreak, the rest with matters like the gypsy moth infestation, the death of the chief judge of the provincial court, the election call itself and the appointment of a new solicitor-general following the resignation of John van Dongen.</p>
<p>But a much different pattern was evident from the releases from BC Stats. The government statistical agency put out major reports on consumer prices (April 17), business indicators (April 29), current statistics and tourism statistics (both April 30), labour force numbers and trends in earnings and employment (both May 8) and an update on exports on election day itself.</p>
<p>Not all were flattering to the Liberals by any means. "Economy shrinks in 2008 as B.C. feels the effect of global slowdown," was the headline on the April 29 release. Other reports noted the jobless rate had reached a five-year high, there had been a 30-per-cent drop in sawmill production, and a key tourism indicator, room revenues, was down for the third month in a row.</p>
<p>Clearly BC Stats was determined to release information on the usual schedule, withholding nothing and leaving it to the political parties to make what they would of the data.</p>
<p>As it happens, BC Stats is also part of the ministry of citizens' services. I asked Stewart if the business-as-usual approach was not a better way to keep the citizenry informed during an election campaign.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen those numbers that you've referred to," he confessed. But he promised to review the releases from BC Stats and decide whether they conformed to the policy followed by the public affairs bureau.</p>
<p>I hate to prejudge a new minister. But I'm guessing that when the review is completed, the withholding policy will remain in place and the routine releases from B.C. Stats will be suppressed -- there's that word again -- in future elections.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Zelinski to hit the books</b>
</div><div>Murray McCormick </div>
<div>The Leader-Post</div>

</p>
<p>Jeff Zelinski has chosen his education needs over those of the Saskatchewan Roughriders.</p>
<p>The rookie defensive back was recently placed on the suspended list by the CFL team. When reached Monday, Zelinski said that he plans on working this summer, returning to Saint Mary's University for his final year of CIS football and completing his geology degree. He has every intention of returning to the Riders in 2010.</p>
<p>"I thought that training camp went really well,'' said Zelinski. "I just decided that this wasn't the year for me to be with the Riders. I hope that it's a better one next year.''</p>
<p>Zelinski is to spend summer prospecting for minerals in northern Quebec. Then he'll join the Huskies.</p>
<p>"I need one more year to graduate and I still have a year left of football,'' said Zelinski. "After that I will be in a better position to complete my pro career.''</p>
<p>The Riders have already played a waiting game with Zelinski, a 26-year-old native of Mission, B.C. He was selected in the fifth round (40th overall) of the 2008 CFL draft. He returned to Saint Mary's for his fourth season and was enjoying a solid rookie camp before leaving.</p>
<p>This year, the Riders felt that Zelinski had an opportunity to make the team or the practice roster. They had also anticipated that he might return to university. Receiver Rob Bagg followed a similar path in 2007 when he returned to Queen's University after being offered a roster spot.</p>
<p>"It was a hard decision because I also felt I had a chance to earn a roster spot but I feel that I made the right decision,'' said Zelinski, who is 6-foot-3 and 200 pounds.</p>
<p>n During the Riders' annual general meeting on Saturday, it was announced that Jim Hopson's contract had been extended through 2011.</p>
<p>The Riders may eventually be looking for a new president and CEO, which could be quite the challenge because Hopson is approachable and knowledgeable and has guided the team through some challenging times. Hopson, who played four seasons with the Riders, completes the package with a football background.</p>
<p>"It's an interesting set of talents that you need for the job,'' said Rob Pletch, chair of the Riders' board of directors. "Should it be a football-based background or a senior business kind of experience? We're not sure of that but we will do a wide-ranging search and engage a consultant for a formal one.''</p>
<p>Hopson has helped turn around the Roughriders' fortunes on the field and as a business. In 2008, the Riders recorded a net profit of $1.6 million.</p>
<p>"Always leave things in better shape than when you arrived,'' Hopson said with a chuckle.</p>
<p>NOTES: Concerns about the H1N1 flu were raised during the AGM. Hopson said the players and staff are provided with an opportunity for flu shots every year. The team also upgraded its laundry facilities to wash the clothing and equipment with hot water. There are also hand sanitizers throughout the locker room. "If we did have a flu bug and it hit the team, it would certainly have a big impact,'' said Hopson. "As a league we need to have a strategy about this ... We need to have a talk about that before we get much further into the season.'' ... The Riders are to reveal their 1960s retro jerseys Wednesday, 2 p.m., at the Northgate Mall. The July 18 home game against the Montreal Alouettes has been designated the Riders' retro-game. The Riders will also wear the retro jerseys in Montreal on Aug. 21 and in the Labour Day Classic on Sept. 6 ... Thursday at 1 p.m. is the official cut-down date for CFL teams. The Riders have to reduce their current roster of 76 players to 46 (excluding players on the nine-game injured list). There is also a seven-player practice roster, of which one player must be a Canadian.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu forces CHEO to call up staff; Number of patients with H1N1 symptoms has put considerable strain on resources</b>
</div><div>Mohammed Adam </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen; with files from Citizen News Services</div>
<div>930 words</div><div>23 June 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>The number of patients going to the emergency department of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario has jumped 17 per cent in the past few weeks because of the H1N1 swine flu, forcing the hospital to call up more staff to work extra shifts.</p>
<p>CHEO's emergency department typically sees about 160 patients a day, and during the summer months staff numbers drop as fewer patients are expected. This year, however, the rising number of children showing up at the ER with H1N1 flu symptoms has forced the hospital to increase staffing to cope. While the situation has not developed into a crisis, hospital officials say it has put considerable strain on workers and resources.</p>
<p>"It is impacting all staff and physicians and they have done what needs to be done and worked extra shifts when needed," said Dr. Lindy Samson, CHEO's chief of infectious diseases and head of pandemic planning.</p>
<p>"What we've done is increased the number of nursing staff that are available each shift at the emergency department, as well as increase the number of support staff. We've returned to what we usually have to do during our peak viral season in the middle of winter."</p>
<p>The financial strain is also significant.</p>
<p>The hospital has been dealing with additional costs not only for increased staffing, but also for supplies such as gowns, gloves and masks, as well as putting patients in isolation and doing laboratory tests for the new flu virus. The hospital's laboratory, which serves the Champlain health region, is not paid by the number of tests it does -- it gets a lump sum to cover its costs. With the large number of tests being done, the hospital is likely facing a budget shortfall. Numbers are being crunched and exact figures won't be known for weeks, spokeswoman Ann Fuller said.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu, which was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization two weeks ago, has spread to 100 countries and territories. More than 52,000 people have been infected and more than 230 have died. According to the WHO, the global infection has risen by nearly 8,000 cases and more than 50 deaths since last Friday, indicating it's a fast-spreading virus.</p>
<p>The U.S. led the world in the number of new cases over the weekend -- 3,594, taking the number infected to 21,449, with 87 dead. Scientists are particularly worried about the spread of the virus into southern-hemisphere countries entering their winter seasons. Chile, the latest of such countries, has been hard hit, with nearly 1,200 new cases, bringing the total to more than 4,300 and four deaths. In Australia, the other southern hemisphere country being monitored by experts, there've been 237 new cases for a total of 2,436 and one death.</p>
<p>Canada has seen an extra 805 cases, taking the overall toll to 5,710 and 13 deaths. On Monday, authorities confirmed the first death of an Ontario child with the flu, in Peel region outside Toronto. A six-year-old girl died on June 15 outside hospital, said Ontario's chief medical officer of health, but it wasn't confirmed she had H1N1 flu until June 19.</p>
<p>As of Monday, 261 cases of the flu have been confirmed in Ottawa, with half of those among children under 16, though health authorities say they're no longer keeping a close count. No deaths have been reported in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Samson said many children have shown up at CHEO's emergency department with flu-like symptoms that their parents suspected to be H1N1, but was not.</p>
<p>Others were clearly infected.</p>
<p>"We've definitely had children that both have come into the emergency department and been sent home that have been confirmed with H1N1 virus, and also several that have required admission to the hospital," Samson said.</p>
<p>CHEO wouldn't say how many patients have been infected with H1N1 or hospitalized with the virus, but Samson said the hospital has "risen to the occasion" throughout the outbreak and provided appropriate care.</p>
<p>Pat Elliott-Miller, the hospital's vice-president of patient care and chief of nursing, explained that during the peak flu season from December to May, key sections such as the intensive care unit or the emergency department would staff about nine nurses during the day and the same number at night. In the summer, this number is ordinarily reduced to about seven each day and night, but now the staffing levels are back to peak-season service. Spread across the hospital, the numbers required to cover the extra hours suddenly become large.</p>
<p>"When you multiply that across the number of patient care units we have, that becomes a bit of a big deal. That's about 40 nurses per 24 hours working extra shifts, extra hours," Elliott-Miller said.</p>
<p>Samson said parents can help ease the pressure by dealing with flu-like symptoms at home and going to the ER only in a true emergency.</p>
<p>"When children get sick at home with fever and cough, parents should really manage the fever at home, making sure the children drink enough fluids to stay hydrated," she said.</p>
<p>"If they develop any breathing problems, or severe headache, or the children are sleepy and can't be woken up, that's the time when you come to the emergency department."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Public Health Agency seeks new 'visual identity'</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>520 words</div><div>23 June 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has issued a tender for someone to come up with a new "visual identity" for the organization, addressing apparent public confusion over what the $600-million organization does, exactly.</p>
<p>The agency is seeking "a design firm with the passion, creativity and expertise to help develop a unique and effective visual identity system," say tendering documents recently released. "An identity that captures clearly, and in a compelling way, [the agency's] unique character, role and value for Canadians and that contributes to building trust and pride in the organization."</p>
<p>The request for proposal comes as the organization deals with the ongoing H1N1 flu pandemic, its biggest and most high-profile challenge since coming into being five years ago, even if the virus has so far caused mostly mild illness.</p>
<p>The head of a professional organization for public-health officials said she would not comment on whether the branding project is a wise expenditure or not, but said public-health generally and the agency specifically tend to operate "under the radar." The outfit's U. S. counterpart, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), is probably better known here, said Debra Lynkowski, CEO of the Canadian Public Health Association.</p>
<p>"The agency does need to be increasingly visible and recognizable to the general public, so it's not just seen as another government department," she said. "The general public needs to know where to turn to and they need to know there is a credible, authoritative voice and organization."</p>
<p>Made up largely of former Health Canada officials but no longer part of that department, the agency was created in response to criticism of how the public-health system at all levels handled the SARS crisis.</p>
<p>Modelled loosely on the CDC, its mission is to help prevent and control infectious and chronic disease, promote general health and deal with public-health emergencies such as the H1N1 flu. With 2,400 employees and an annual budget of $600 million, the agency has won widespread praise for providing prompt and reliable information on the new flu and aiding in the investigation of the virus with its high-security labs in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Yet public-opinion research has shown that Canadians tend to confuse public health with the health-care system generally, and are not sure of the respective roles of Health Canada and the agency, according to the tender documents. "Although the original visual identity has been refined twice ... there is a clear sense that it is neither unique nor robust enough to reflect the changing complexity and scope of the agency's work," the material indicates.</p>
<p>The design company that wins the contract, worth up to $76,000, is supposed to provide two or three creative concepts for a new, consistent look to be used for the agency's website and publications, news releases and exhibit booths.</p>
<p>Having a consistent design for communications material should ultimately save the organization money because individual program areas will not have to contract out for design work, said Jirina Vlk, an agency spokeswoman.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Preventing absenteeism key to corporate health; Captains of industry discuss plans, practices for dealing with flu pandemic</b>

<div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A new report on corporate risk and pandemic preparedness touts the benefits associated with having business plans in place for a global outbreak of flu, likening them to insurance against a calamity like fire.</p>
<p>The report by Amin Mawani of the Schulich School of Business at Toronto's York University says companies that are capable of preventing absenteeism if the current H1N1 flu pandemic leads to more serious illness in Canada this fall will be well-positioned to take customers and market share from those that can't.</p>
<p>They may enjoy higher stock prices and cheaper credit because financial markets tend to reward firms that report steady profits and cash flows, said the report, released yesterday at the World Conference on Disaster Management in Toronto.</p>
<p>The report highlights the findings of a round table held last month, where managers from nine major corporations discussed their practices and plans for dealing with an influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>"Investing in pandemic preparedness is analogous to investing in insurance. You cannot buy fire insurance after the fire,'' Mawani said in an interview.</p>
<p>"Most of us have fire insurance, but we might not have pandemic insurance. And by pandemic insurance, I mean just the investments required to plan and prepare and be ready if something like this happens to your organizations. You have a business continuity plan that allows you to continue producing profits and safeguarding your employees.''</p>
<p>The World Health Organization declared a pandemic June 11 because of the new strain of H1N1 that's circulating, and this report suggests the probability of a second, perhaps more lethal, wave of virus outbreak in the fall in the Northern Hemisphere may be higher than eight per cent.</p>
<p>Mawani said that in January 2009, the World Economic Forum at Davos, Switzerland, put the probability of a pandemic at about eight per cent. But now that there is a pandemic, he suggested that's an old number and "it could come back as a much more lethal virus in the fall . . . and it could be a lot higher than eight per cent now.''</p>
<p>The focus of the round table report is employee absenteeism. If 15 to 30 per cent of employees are absent due to an influenza pandemic, it could erode profits by 15 to 30 per cent or more, depending on the organization, Mawani said.</p>
<p>One option would be to allow employees to work on their computers from home, but he warns that if the rates of people doing this are high, then broadband capacity may not be sufficient for productive work.</p>
<p>"Second, if you have critical employees, just because you're at home doesn't mean they're safer. In fact, sometimes the safest place may be at work. So to really keep them safe you need them to be protected, and one of the options for that, among other things, is antiviral medication,'' he said.</p>
<p>The report said federal and provincial government agencies should consider issuing guidelines to corporations on stockpiling antivirals to protect their employees.</p>
<p>In contrast, it says U.S. health officials explicitly stated in guidelines last December that stockpiling antiviral drugs and planning for their use is the responsibility of employers as part of comprehensive pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>The companies involved in the round table all had "robust'' plans, Mawani said.</p>

<p>The cost of 'free' mail</p>
<p>I agree with Dianne Cooper's letter (Junk the mail, June 15) about the flyers sent out by the Conservative party. I also have received numerous ones from every Manitoba MP -- even though they do not represent my riding. Our post office is struggling financially -- no wonder with this avalanche of free (?) mail.</p>

<p>CPP chairman defended</p>
<p>Re: the letter Worth $3 million (June 13). I certainly respect writer Diane Drummond's right to comment on the salary and bonuses given to the executives of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. However she should ensure that she has her facts straight.</p>
<p>Bob Astley is the chairman of the board of directors of the CPP Investment Board, which is managed independently of the Canada Pension Plan. He did not receive the $3 million she refers to. The bonuses were paid to the executives of the CPPIB. And there has been quite a bit of response to the news item so Drummond may want to check out those responses both in the House of Commons and in the media.</p>

<p>Guilt-free bluejays</p>
<p>Re: the letter Don't feed the bluejays (June 20). You are attributing human characteristics to wildlife. Unlike human beings, wildlife does not kill for pleasure or profit, but for survival. The bluejay and crow also have natural enemies, and they in turn will become the prey of a stronger predator.</p>
<p>Perhaps your moral outrage should be directed to governments that allow clear-cutting of boreal forests and all forests, allowing toxic wastes to be dumped into our dwindling water supply, and industrial pollution, actions that have catastrophic consequences for nature and of course for the human population. It isn't the crow or bluejay that is decimating the population of the songbirds and robins, or preventing your enjoyment of them.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that with the destruction of our natural resources, much profit is gained in supplying you with many comforts and conveniences that you could well do without -- three automobiles for one family, several computers for one family, and the manufacturing of mountains of junk people have been programmed into believing they must have.</p>
<p>It is not the "do-gooders" who are upsetting the balance of nature.</p>

<p>Vote on Dennistoun</p>
<p>On Wednesday, city council is set to decide on the fate of Dennistoun House. The decision by Standing Committee on Planning and Development and subsequently EPC to de-list Dennistoun House is inconsistent with the Osborne Village Neighborhood Plan, where one of the key objectives outlined in the plan is to "Protect, maintain, and encourage conservation of heritage buildings".</p>
<p>No exceptional circumstances exist to warrant the de-listing of Dennistoun House, apart from the proposed Sunstone development that will place unnecessary strain on already overburdened infrastructure. Traffic congestion will be exacerbated with an additional 100 vehicles associated with the 80 new units; the new building will overwhelm Roslyn Road in a region that now provides a welcome respite from high-rise condo towers; the stately elms behind which Dennistoun House resides will be lost to buildings balanced on the edge of a road razed of its character and living history.</p>
<p>For these reasons, Osborne Village residents have launched an online petition in opposition to the EPC decision to de-list Dennistoun House, which may be found at</p>

<p>St. Amant under scope</p>
<p>The recent revelation that was contained in the article Movie trumps care for disabled (June 19) shocked and appalled those of us who work in the community living field and advocate on behalf of persons with disabilities. We were dismayed to hear that the two staff involved in the incident were experienced. Much better safeguards need to be in place to protect our most vulnerable citizens.</p>
<p>I'm glad that St. Amant has fired the employees who were involved in the incident. Many of my colleagues in the disability field would like to see some charges laid. We hope that this will send the message to others in the field that this sort of behaviour will not be tolerated. And the community will be watching to see if any changes will be made to St. Amant's policies and procedures as it undertakes a review of the incident.</p>

<p>Vaccine history</p>
<p>The news is filled with daily reports warn of the upcoming flu pandemic, with comparisons being made to the Spanish influenza of 1918. Some researchers believe that the Spanish influenza was caused by inoculations given to soldiers going to war. The virus in their system from the vaccine multiplied into full flu symptoms upon their return. The manufacturers of the vaccine had unsold amounts of the vaccine virus and the general public was panicked into receiving the inoculations.</p>
<p>I lived in the United States in 1976 and witnessed panic generated about the upcoming swine flu pandemic firsthand. Parameters were set up as to who would receive the vaccine and some people wanted their children to get the shot destined for the parent. Some people died the same day as receiving the vaccine and others developed complications from the vaccine and ultimately died.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone believes this information, however it would be nice to see balanced reporting in the news. Those who fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors are destined to repeat them.</p>

<p>Feeling farmers' pain</p>
<p>Re: Interlake, east a soggy disaster (June 19). Del Barkman stated, "It will do farmers in unless the government is going to step up to the plate." For years, many area farmers have fought with the province and local municipalities for better drainage. Fields often remain unnecessarily waterlogged, delaying seeding and causing undue pressure and stress to meet the insurance deadline. Compound the improper drainage with the flooding from last summer and the area is now heading for a virtual fiscal disaster.</p>
<p>If farmers have a bad year, everyone has a bad year. As the sale of vehicles and implements plummet, so will registration numbers for expensive sports such as hockey and figure skating. Long gone are the days of the fall "bumper crop" money, normally used to buy furniture or a new appliance, instead used to stave off inevitable debt so farmers do not lose their homes. Many will stop eating at their local restaurant, something they will no longer be able to afford -- that is if they are able to afford to eat at all.</p>

<p>Create bicycle sidewalks</p>
<p>During Glen Murray's tenure as mayor, I wrote to him and his council to complain about bicycles riding at excessive speeds on the sidewalk. Then-police chief Jack Ewatski wrote me a courteous letter assuring me that he was aware of the problem and that cycling on a sidewalk should result in a $40 fine. Unfortunately, the law remained unenforced. On one occasion, I saw three policemen manning a radar gun and issuing tickets to car drivers for speeding. Several cyclists drove right past them at relatively high speeds on the sidewalk. When I asked the police why they allowed cyclists to break the law so blatantly, I received only blank stares.</p>
<p>Recently, while driving my car on Main Street, I witnessed a strange traffic drama. Cycling slowly in one of the lanes and seriously impeding traffic was a young woman wearing a bicycle helmet on her head. Very good, I thought. Unfortunately, attached to the rear of her bicycle was an extremely flimsy and dangerous child buggy. It contained a tiny and totally unprotected child. The advent of these buggies should have resulted in strictly enforced laws to regulate their use. Many now appear on our sidewalks.</p>
<p>So how can this problem be solved? Most streets have sidewalks on both sides, so why not designate one side of certain streets to be for the exclusive use of pedestrians, and the opposite side for bicycles. These "sidewalk bicycle paths" should have signs reminding cyclists of speed limits and other laws. If this experiment is not successful, it can be abandoned without large capital losses. Why not give it a try? The present situation is chaotic, dangerous and intolerable.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Kids, natives most in need of vaccine; Canadian health officials developing a priority list for giving out H1N1 flu shots, expected to be in short supply</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>781 words</div><div>22 June 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>Five-to-40-year-olds and Canada's aboriginal communities should be the first to get vaccinated against human swine flu, experts say as Canadian officials decide who gets priority for the flu shots.</p>
<p>Under Canada's official pandemic plan, the entire population would ultimately be immunized against the H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>But the vaccine will become available in batches, meaning the entire population can't be vaccinated at once. It might take four or five months to get all the vaccine we're going to get, during which time a second wave of swine flu may well be underway.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is working on a priority list, deciding where the first batches should go, and who should get the injections first. All provinces and territories would be expected to follow the national prioritization scheme.</p>
<p>Unlike normal seasonal flu, the H1N1 virus appears to be disproportionately infecting older children and young adults. So far the largest number of confirmed cases have occurred in people between the ages of five and 24.</p>
<p>"It doesn't mean they're all getting sick and need to be hospitalized, but they're getting significant illness," said Dr. Noni MacDonald, a leader in pediatric infectious diseases and a professor of pediatrics at Dalhousie University in Halifax.</p>
<p>British researchers reported last week that targeting children first would protect not only them, but also unvaccinated adults.</p>
<p>"Even if you are concerned about the elderly, who are often mentioned as another risk group, their main connection to the big pool of infection is often their grandchildren," said Dr. Thomas House of the University of Warwick.</p>
<p>But adults older than 64 don't appear to be at increased risk of H1N1-related complications so far in the outbreak. It's possible they have some antibodies against the virus.</p>
<p>As well, children "are known to be really important for transmitting flu," said Earl Brown, executive director of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"They're important for the cycle of infection. They tend to be naive as far as not having flu antibodies in their system before. And really young kids, their immune systems aren't fully mature.</p>
<p>"Children tend to be hit, and they can be hit harder," Brown said. By immunizing children first, "you get to try to block spread, and protect a vulnerable group."</p>
<p>Gymnasiums would be used for mass school-based vaccination programs but experts say the harder to reach group will be the 18-to-30-year-olds.</p>
<p>"Some of them are in school, a lot of them are not," MacDonald said. "They're very much living in the moment and don't necessarily see themselves as being at risk. We need some fast thinking about how to reach those people."</p>
<p>She suggested booths could be set up outside bars for information and immunization.</p>
<p>"You've got to be creative about this and really think out of the box."</p>
<p>Canada's aboriginal communities also appear to be getting more serious infections. Crowded, poorly ventilated housing and poor access to high-quality running water and sanitization are some of the factors being blamed. Aboriginals also have higher rates of asthma, chronic lung disease, obesity and diabetes -- the very diseases early data suggests puts people at higher risk of life-threatening complications from swine flu.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine will be a separate vaccine from the regular, annual flu shot. People will require two jabs, and possibly three, depending on how effective the vaccine is in producing immunity. The Public Health Agency of Canada says no decisions have yet been made about who would get priority first.</p>
<p>One of the challenges will be getting people to agree to the shots. There will be limited information about any vaccine's safety before immunization campaigns are rolled out across the country.</p>
<p>"We usually do research in healthy adults before we do it in children, because this is a new vaccine, and you want to be sure that it's safe and effective before you give it to vulnerable populations, or populations who don't have full capacity to make an informed decision about getting it or not," said Dr. Joanne Langley, of Health Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization.</p>
<p>"There are pros and cons to putting [children] first."</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The pandemic that hit like a cyclone but mellowed to a cool breeze could still take the world by storm.</p>
<p>That's why it's crucial, in the relatively present calm, to soak up lessons from the ongoing H1N1 flu situation, say speakers at a disaster management conference in Toronto this week.</p>
<p>"There's a belief we missed the bullet, which is a little unnerving,'' said Regina Phelps, founder of San Francisco-based company Emergency Management and Safety Solutions.</p>
<p>"That says to me people are thinking 'Gee, we're done, we missed it, we lucked out, it wasn't bad and life is going to continue on as it is.' Which could be a huge mistake."</p>
<p>If seasonal flu strikes this fall as expected, there's also potential for a more vicious second wave of illness and deaths related to the new H1N1 virus. It's something everyone should prepare for, Phelps said.</p>
<p>"We're in a situation that is evolving and that is highly fluid and if anyone tells you they know what is going to happen they're totally fooling themselves, because no one actually does.''</p>
<p>Dr. Allison McGeer, a Toronto-based flu expert, agrees that more planning is necessary.</p>
<p>"Influenza is very difficult for all of us to get our heads around . . . (because) even in a catastrophic situation, most illness is mild,'' she said.</p>
<p>"It's hard to respond to disease in which risk is relatively low for each individual patient, but risk to the community is high.''</p>

<p>New law decriminalizes</p>
<p>small amounts of drugs</p>
<p>The legislature has voted quietly to decriminalize possession of small amounts of pot, cocaine, methamphetamine and other drugs.</p>
<p>The bill was approved at the height of a swine-flu outbreak that dominated the public's attention in April. It still needs President Felipe Calderon's signature.</p>
<p>Under the bill, those caught with five grams of marijuana, 500 milligrams of cocaine, 40 milligrams of methamphetamine or 50 milligrams of heroin will not be criminally prosecuted. Calderon himself proposed the bill, reasoning it makes sense to distinguish between small-time users and big-time dealers, while retargeting crime-fighting resources away from the former and toward the latter and their drug lord bosses.</p>
