<p>At first, Martin Melchor didn't take Mexico's flu epidemic all that seriously.</p>
<p>But then, this week, a wealthy 33-year-old neighbour died of the virus at a private hospital around the corner from Mr. Melchor's Mexico City apartment. Next, he met the grieving relatives of a second flu victim: a healthy 25-year-old woman who died Tuesday at the National Institute of Respiratory Illnesses.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the horror became real.</p>
<p>“She had two young kids and her relatives were all there crying in the hospital. She was only sick for a day,” Mr. Melchor said in a phone interview from the Mexican capital.</p>
<p>“When I came home, I took my clothes off, put them in a plastic bag and threw them away, and showered. I got really worried. It's affecting all social classes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Melchor, a 37-year-old videographer who normally earns his living assisting international television crews, is now too agitated to leave his home. His biggest fear is that his three-year-old daughter will be exposed to influenza A H1N1, blamed as of yesterday afternoon for 176 deaths and 2,498 illnesses in Mexico. He only ventures out for runs to the supermarket or pharmacy.</p>
<p>Not that there would be much to do. The city, normally teeming with outdoor vendors, musicians, protesters, festivals and traffic jams, is as quiet as a morgue. This is life under lockdown: Parks are closed and plazas empty. Malls, museums, cinemas and shops are shuttered – as well as most restaurants and cafés, including some of the country's 259 <span class="companylink">Starbucks</span> outlets. Concerts at the National Auditorium have been cancelled, and so have masses at churches around the capital. Soccer games at the Azteca Stadium are being played without spectators.</p>
<p>“The hardest thing is not knowing what's really going on,” said Mr. Melchor of the sense of foreboding permeating the city of 22 million.All across the sprawling metropolis, Mexicans are scrambling to cope with the psychological challenges of living with an invisible predator – and the practical challenges of getting around, and finding child care, food and water in a city under lockdown.</p>
<p>The Mexican government urged all citizens to stay home today through Tuesday, and ordered all but the most essential government services closed during the five-day Cinco de Mayo festival in the hope of containing the epidemic, which the World Health Organization warns is on the brink of becoming a global epidemic.</p>
<p>“There is no safer place to protect yourself against catching swine flu than in your house,” said Mexican President Felipe Calderon in a televised address Wednesday night.</p>
<p>But that doesn't stop the anxiety. Mr. Melchor visited his own doctor twice this week, convinced he was running a fever (he was given a clean bill of health). He has face masks and hand gel, which are now in short supply at drugstores.</p>
<p>“There is a sense of bewilderment,” said an expatriate consultant who lives in the wealthy Polanco neighbourhood. “Friends won't come over to your house. The people who can have left the capital.”</p>
<p>She continued to go to the office this week, the consultant said, but all work and social events were cancelled, including a children's birthday party. Her children, aged 3 and 6, complain about being cooped up since their school shut down. Bored with indoor diversions, they have begun colouring on face masks scattered around their living room. Yet there is underlying apprehension.</p>
<p>“My six-year-old is crying, saying, ‘Mama, I don't want to die,' ” said the woman, who asked not to be identified. “People don't know when it's going to end and that is very difficult.”</p>
<p>Those who have second homes outside the capital are decamping for them, and staying in touch with extended-family members by phone, e-mail and text message.</p>
<p>While most Mexicans are calmly obeying government instructions to stay inside and not kiss in greeting, or shake hands, some are starting to question the effectiveness of the official response to the epidemic.</p>
<p>“Every day it gets worse, there are new restrictions, and it seems like the authorities are not ready for it because they don't know exactly what it is they're fighting against,” said Paloma Jimenez Anabitarte, a 23-year-old consultant. “I heard my downstairs neighbour is in the hospital, so I'm getting more worried about it.”</p>
<p>Ms. Jimenez Anabitarte has stocked up on several weeks supply of water and food, and plans to get out of the city this weekend.</p>
<p>Public-health officers still haven't given medicine to the families of those confirmed to have died from influenza A N1H1, or determined where the outbreak began or how it spread. That means people are still spreading it. Officials confirmed that the first person to die of the flu, in Oaxaca, was a door-to-door census taker who may have had contact with scores of people before she died on April 13.</p>
<p>“If the government had acted more quickly, then people wouldn't have died. We don't have enough labs to test all those who are sick,” Mr. Melchor complained. “God is kicking us now. What else can happen?”</p>
<p>With the violence from the ongoing drug cartel wars, this week's 5.6-magnitude earthquake near Chilpancingo in the Pacific Coast state of Guerrero, and the impact of the global economic recession, some fear one more disaster could yet unfold in this beleaguered country: “What's next, a volcano?” said Ms. Jimenez Anabitarte.</p>
<p>Mr. Melchor is hoping to leave the capital today and fly to Arizona, where his wife is. He is worried about his daughter catching a cold on the plane. But, he says, at least that's a concern he can manage – unlike the terror of something unknown, a new flu strain even scientists don't yet understand.</p>

<p>CANBERRA -- A fatal blast on a boat filled to the gunwales with unauthorized arrivals has turned Australia's attention back to the vexed problem of those incoming tides of people wanting to start a new life in "the lucky country.''</p>
<p>Even the mounting panic sparked by swine flu hasn't deflected public attention from the sudden resurgence of boat people making their perilous way to Australia over the past few months.</p>
<p>Unlike Canada, Australia has a mandatory detention system for asylum seekers.</p>
<p>Although the nation was one of the first to sign the United Nations Convention on the Status Of Refugees in the goodwill following the Second World War, the passage of time has hardened attitudes towards those who come here seeking protection.</p>
<p>Australia jettisoned much of its international nice guy image in August 2001 when it appeared on the national stage openly questioning the legitimacy of those incoming hordes yearning to breathe free.</p>
<p>The then-prime minister John Howard refused to allow 438 Afghan asylum seekers (or unauthorized arrivals -- the terminology depends on where your sympathies lay) on board the Norwegian-based MV Tampa make landfall.</p>
<p>Howard at the height of the crisis was seen in the Canberra press gallery talking to journalists, furiously defending his right to maintain the integrity of the nation's borders.</p>
<p>"We will decide who comes into this country and the circumstances in which they come,'' he later famously declared and his domestic, if not international, popularity soared, helping him win the tough 2001 election.</p>
<p>Australia, which had and maintains a relatively generous refugee and general immigration program, enacted tough laws ensuring any unannounced arrivals turning up on boats were processed offshore in immigration centres.</p>
<p>With the arrivals receding since the high water mark of 2001, the subject of asylum seekers also receded in the public mind.</p>
<p>That was until last September when desperate men and women often with children in tow began arriving off the Western Australian Coast, often on isolated Ashmore Reef, fleeing countries such as Afghanistan, Iraq and Sri Lanka.</p>
<p>Little more than two weeks ago tragedy struck.</p>
<p>Defence Force personnel were boarding a boat filled with suspected illegal arrivals on Ashmore Reef when an explosion occurred, killing five of the arrivals and injuring several military employees.</p>
<p>Many more of the arrivals were horribly burned and are still undergoing their agonizing recoveries in burns units in hospitals around the country.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Kevin Rudd was faced with accusations his perceived softer approach to handling illegal arrivals had sparked the latest wave.</p>
<p>He immediately confronted the media declaring all people-smugglers should "rot in hell.''</p>
<p>Rudd then announced the nation was going into recession -- an admission which although obvious appeared to distract the headlines away from the subject of illegal arrivals, at least for a time.</p>
<p>But the federal Opposition saw a political opportunity, and kept the issue alive by blaming the Labor government, elected in November 2007, for encouraging the new arrivals and by extension, for being responsible for the Ashmore Reef tragedy and the loss of life.</p>
<p>Opposition Leader Malcolm Turnbull has called for an independent inquiry accusing the government of presiding over a "massive policy failure.''</p>
<p>The new Cdn $320-million detention centre on Christmas Island near Ashmore Reef is still well below its maximum capacity of 800, or the 400 it can hold comfortably.</p>
<p>But 234 detainees are now in various forms of detention -- creating another bureaucratic nightmare for the government.</p>
<p>Still, journalist Mike Steketee, writing in the national broadsheet The Australian, suggests the issues may not carry the great political weight it did eight years ago.</p>
<p>Australia is a giant island. Unlike European nations or even Canada it has thousands of square kilometres of ocean deterring those wanting to arrive through the back door.</p>
<p>Steketee cites polling which suggests Australians are more indifferent than xenophobic about the latest arrivals, "even if the debate did seem to proceed on the issue we are open to some sort of mass invasion.''</p>
<p>"The reality is very different: very few slip through the multiple layers of the border protection net,'' Steketee wrote.</p>
<p>"Our controls on people who move by air, which is the main way most would-be refugees come to Australia, are among the strictest in the world.''</p>

</p>
<p>Some Canadian high schools and at least one university have cancelled trips to Mexico and the United States over fears prompted by the outbreak of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Among them is a high school band from Edmonton that returned home this week from California, where there are 14 flu confirmed cases.</p>
<p>The band had been scheduled to perform at Disneyland.</p>
<p>"I was disappointed," 17-year-old Kelsey Johnson said yesterday in Edmonton. "There was not a single person on this trip who wasn't."</p>
<p>The trip was one of four school-organized ventures called home by Alberta officials after a decision Tuesday to suspend all travel. Three other band trips in progress to Vancouver also had to return home.</p>
<p>Quebec City's Laval University has asked six students and two professors to return from academic exchanges or internships in Mexico.</p>
<p>They have been told by the university to stay home for a week -- the period recommended by the Public Health Agency of Canada to verify whether any flu symptoms develop.</p>
<p>Two Montreal-area high schools -- Laurier MacDonald and John F. Kennedy -- have also cancelled plans to visit New York City.</p>
<p>"We feel that the safety and health of our children come first," said Laurier MacDonald principal Eileen Kelly. "I'm erring on [the side] of extreme caution."</p>
<p>Some school trips, however, went ahead as planned. Students from Calgary's Bishop Carroll High School left for a New York musical festival Wednesday morning after parents voted to overturn a school-district ban.</p>
<p>And David Weir, a spokesman for the Vancouver School Board, said no Vancouver schools had cancelled trips because of the flu outbreak. He said that could change if Vancouver Coastal Health recommends a travel ban.</p>
<p>Officials also put a hold on the annual Canada-Mexico Inter-Parliamentary Meeting, set for Ottawa and Saint John, N.B., May 5-9.</p>
<p>A statement from Parliament said the meeting -- which started between the two countries in 1975 -- will be rescheduled "in view of shared concerns and preoccupations with the emergency situation being experienced in both countries."</p>

</p>
<p>A Vernon elementary school was closed yesterday after one of its students was diagnosed with one of the five new cases of H1N1 swine flu reported in B.C.</p>
<p>The total number of cases of the disease in B.C. stood at 11 -- none of them severe -- yesterday, but that number is expected to rise, said the B.C. Centre for Disease Control's flu expert, Dr. Danuta Skowronski.</p>
<p>After officials made the decision to close Beairsto Elementary School until May 8, the society that operates a large daycare where some Beairsto students go for after-school programs followed suit.</p>
<p>"It's frightening," Michele Tepper said of the closing of West Vernon Child Care Centre, a converted school. She estimated between 200 and 300 children attend the centre, which offers programs for children aged six months to 12 years old.</p>
<p>"I'm worried about my daughter being there. There are quite a few kids [from Beairsto] that go to the after-school program at the daycare centre," Tepper said.</p>
<p>The Beairsto student is the first case of H1N1, as the virus is now being called, reported in the Okanagan.</p>
<p>"The student is experiencing a mild case and is at home recovering well," the B.C. Health Ministry said.</p>
<p>Travel to Mexico remains the main source of H1N1 infection. Skowronski said 10 of B.C.'s 11 cases were acquired by people in Mexico.</p>
<p>"The one person who did not travel to Mexico did have contact with a large number of travellers to Mexico," she told a press conference at BCCDC headquarters in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Nine of the 11 are adults aged between 20 and 45, said Skowronski; the other two are an infant and the elementary student in Vernon.</p>
<p>Only one person in B.C. was hospitalized, but that person was sent home after an overnight stay.</p>
<p>"We are fully anticipating that there will be more cases, including secondary infections," said Skowronski, an epidemiologist.</p>
<p>She cautioned the public to remain calm, but to act responsibly if someone comes down with the flu. "If you have fever and cough, take the week off," she said.</p>
<p>Anyone who needs to see a doctor for the flu should call ahead before showing up at the doctor's office or hospital, to allow time for proper precautions, she said.</p>
<p>Because a person's hands are one of the most common ways to transmit the virus, she said people should wash their hands often and only cough or sneeze into a tissue or their elbow, not on to their hands.</p>
<p>Anyone suspecting H1N1 symptoms can call HealthLink B.C. at 811 at any time of day or night.</p>
<p>The federal government will launch a public-awareness campaign today to inform Canadians about the H1N1 flu as the number of cases in Canada climbed to 34 and the number of worldwide cases topped 270.</p>
<p>Fifteen new flu cases, all mild, were confirmed yesterday in Canada. As well as the five B.C. cases, there were four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario and, for the first time, one in Quebec.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization remained one step from labelling the outbreaks -- now confirmed in at least 11 countries and suspected to be in many more -- a pandemic.</p>
<p>Mexico, which is struggling with an epidemic, saw its death toll rise above 200. Test results from that country will likely be faster now that it has its own laboratory capacity. It was sending samples to Canada and the U.S. before experts from both countries went to Mexico to help.</p>
<p>Mexican President Felipe Calderon yesterday ordered government offices and private businesses not crucial to the economy to stop work to avoid further spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"There is no safer place than your own home," Calderon said in his first televised address since the crisis began.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, where the virus has already brought public life to a standstill, some were skeptical while others vowed not to comply.</p>
<p>"Closing businesses is not right and not fair. What are we going to live on? Air?" said tailor Andres Garcia.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Liberals should avoid election fever; Party still needs to fundraise, recruit star candidates</b>
</div><div>Don Martin   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>719 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Just in case those giddy Liberals need a reason to drink, they should raise a glass at the party convention this weekend to the founder of their serendipitious self-celebration: Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>Without the Prime Minister's provocative intervention last fall to eliminate all public funding for political parties, the opposition's dead-on-arrival coalition would not have formed, the ouster of hapless leader Stephane Dion would not have been accelerated and Michael Ignatieff's rivals would not have abandoned their leadership bids.</p>
<p>Thanks to Mr. Harper's unfortunate move, the division and acrimony of a hotly contested leadership race this weekend will be replaced by Liberals singing a Hallelujah Chorus of harmony in Lotusland as they crown Mr. Ignatieff their new king and his MPs start dreaming of their preferred Cabinet gigs.</p>
<p>The Liberals are enjoying a remarkable convergence of favourable scenarios just six months after their electoral collapse to just 77 seats under Mr. Dion.</p>
<p>When Michael Ignatieff claims the leadership uncontested on Saturday, he will be the anti-Harper in leadership style -- a good listener who relishes contact with people, enjoys media exposure, possesses a sense of humour and has a new book out that reads like a long campaign pamphlet extolling his vision as a Canadian newly returned from three decades of globetrotting.</p>
<p>He's basking in don't-pinch-me-I'm-dreaming voter approval, the latest being a CROP poll putting the party ahead of the Bloc Quebecois in Quebec, something that hasn't happened since Paul Martin's leadership was in its brief honeymoon phase.</p>
<p>And Mr. Ignatieff has brought adult supervision to party backrooms while firing up fundraising and hammering together preliminary policy for an election the party thinks may come in the fall, but expects for sure in the spring.</p>
<p>They probably shouldn't catch snap election fever.</p>
<p>An unusual dichotomy is taking place that spans all Canadian political parties. All four leaders need more time to get ready before fighting a campaign.</p>
<p>The Conservatives need the recession to ease and any swine flu pandemic to dissipate before they head for the polls, but not before unleashing the mother of all smear campaigns against Mr. Ignatieff as a landed immigrant filled with waffling opinions.</p>
<p>The Liberals need another year to rebuild their empty war chest and recruit star candidates.</p>
<p>The New Democrats are struggling to prevent their annihilation under a Liberal rebound. They find themselves in an ugly squeeze -- cursed if they support the government, damned if they side with the Liberals. (As for the BQ, well, see polling numbers above.)</p>
<p>Most importantly, Canadians don't want their government mothballed for the election writ period when the twin horrors of an economic and health care crisis are still spiralling into the ugly unknown.</p>
<p>So let's set aside imminent election speculation.</p>
<p>But don't expect Liberals to use their Vancouver wonkfest to wrap themselves in new policies for the</p>
<p>campaign. They learned a hard lesson from releasing the Green Shift carbon tax early, giving Conservatives four months of attack ad material before the October vote.</p>
<p>Mind you, policy talk matters little because conventions rarely dictate government behaviour. Imagine telling 2005 Conservative convention delegates that their new leader would end up buying a piece of Chrysler, incur massive long-term deficits, give the Quebecois "nation" status and stack the Senate with 18 unelected lapdogs. They would've had a heart attack.</p>
<p>That means delegates are mostly gathering as a "meet Michael" exercise for the national television cameras, a chance for Liberals to showcase their leader as a worthy choice for uncertain times.</p>
<p>They'd best relish the marketing opportunity while it lasts. If they don't define him as prime ministerial material quickly, the Conservatives will take their shot at painting Mr. Ignatieff as a good leader-- for the Official Opposition.</p>

<p>STALKER STYMIED</p>
<p>A New York judge has convicted a man of stalking Tyra Banks. Manhattan Criminal Court Judge James Burke heard the case without a jury. He convicted 39-year-old Brady Green, of Dublin, Georgia, yesterday of stalking, harassment, criminal trespass and attempted aggravated harassment.</p>
<p>Green faces as many as 90 days in jail when he is sentenced in June. His lawyer says an appeal is planned.</p>
<p>Banks, a TV host and former supermodel, testified that she feared for her safety, and for that of her staff and family.</p>
<p>His own special brand of entertainment</p>
<p>Russell Brand has requested a hotel room with a stripper pole. The British comic star -- famed for his womanizing ways -- is to start work on movie Get Him to the Greek in Las Vegas and is keen to stay at the <span class="companylink">Planet Hollywood</span> Resort and Casino. Brand has asked for the famous Apex suite, which is known as the "ultimate bachelor pad," and is planning to host several wild parties during his stay. A source said: "The suite has a stripper pole, glass-covered shower, cocktail bar and home cinema system.</p>
<p>"Russell has been joking about the wet and wild parties he will be throwing."</p>
<p>Noel's nasal nightmare</p>
<p>Noel Gallagher caused a swine flu panic by sneezing.</p>
<p>The Oasis rocker arrived in Venezuela with his bandmates this week and was amazed at how people are reacting to the outbreak of the disease -- and was even more shocked when he received a worried telephone call from his mother.</p>
<p>He wrote on his blog: "It's all got a bit mad over here. This swine flu malarky is freaking people out. Landed at Crack'a* * e airport yesterday. All the ground staff are wearing those little white face masks! ALL OF THEM. It was like something out of a Stephen King novel. I suddenly feel quite naked without one.</p>
<p>"Then if that wasn't bad enough my mam called me at that very moment and tells me to be 'careful' or I WILL die of pig flu. I swear at that point I did a massive sneeze and the entire airport fell silent and started to stare!! I WANT A MASK!!!"</p>
<p>One of those 'special' moments</p>
<p>Heidi Klum was surprised when her husband announced she was pregnant.</p>
<p>The supermodel -- who has two children, Henry, 3, and Johan, 2, with musician Seal, and Leni, 4, from a previous relationship -- wasn't ready to tell people she was expecting when Seal let it slip during a concert.</p>
<p>The 35-year-old German beauty said: "I'm still in the very beginning. The news kind of came out faster than I wanted it to. My husband kind of surprised me and everybody at one of his concerts.</p>
<p>"He was just on tour so he told everybody. He's allowed to, obviously. We're very excited." So far, Klum's pregnancy has been easy. Her baby bump is still small and she is not suffering from morning sickness.</p>
<p>ALL GOOD THINGS</p>
<p>Sean Penn has filed for divorce from wife Robin Wright Penn. The actor asked for "legal separation with minor children" from his spouse of 13 years when he filed the papers at a Los Angeles court last week. It is not the first time the couple -- who have two children together, Dylan, 18, and 15-year-old Hopper Jack -- have tried to legally end their stormy marriage.</p>
<p>Is the Mystery Tramp headed for Broadway?</p>
<p>Bob Dylan is writing a musical.</p>
<p>The singer is working on a low-budget production with Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter.</p>
<p>The 67-year-old musician first collaborated with Hunter on his 1988 album Down In The Groove and 10 of the 11 tracks on his latest album Together Through Life -- which was released this week -- were cowritten by the rock lyricist.</p>
<p>Dylan said: "Hunter is an old buddy. We could probably write a hundred songs together if we thought it was important or the right reasons were there."</p>
<p>No rock regrets</p>
<p>Kim Kardashian has picked out an engagement ring -- even though her boyfriend is yet to propose.</p>
<p>The reality TV star -- who has been dating American footballer Reggie Bush for two years -- was out shopping with friends, who are all brides-to-be, when she saw her perfect band.</p>
<p>She said: "He definitely knows all of us went ring shopping. I definitely scared him and told him it was probably way more expensive than it is, just so that when he goes he feels like he's getting a good deal. He knows what it looks like. I think I've e-mailed him enough pictures!"</p>
<p>NOW he's sorry</p>
<p>Christian Bale feels betrayed by the film crew that leaked his angry rant online. The Dark Knight star is happy to accept the backlash following his four-minute, foul-mouthed tirade against a</p>
<p>Terminator Salvation crew member who distracted him during a scene.</p>
<p>Bale acknowledges his attack was "overboard" but insists it shouldn't have been made public.</p>
<p>He said: "I did it, it's in the public space. I take the consequences for it. I'm not hiding from that. I went overboard.</p>
<p>"I'm not making any excuses, but there is an essential trust and it's not a tacit one, which is every sound guy says, 'We are not recording, we are not even listening.' So, well, there goes that."</p>
<p>'Love is lovelier, the second time around'</p>
<p>Jessica Simpson reportedly enjoyed an intimate lunch with ex-boyfriend John Mayer. The singer-and-actress, who is currently dating American football star Tony Romo, secretly met Mayer for a meal in Calabasas, Calif., recently and onlookers claimed they couldn't contain their joy at seeing each other. Musician Mayer -- who has been single since breaking up with Jennifer Aniston earlier this year -- split from Simpson in November 2007. Friends claim the blond beauty was left devastated by the end of the relationship.</p>
<p>More of Jacko's junk up for grabs</p>
<p>Michael Jackson's Bad outfit is up for auction.</p>
<p>The leather jacket and trousers worn by the pop star in the iconic 1987 music video are expected to fetch more than $61,000 when they go under the hammer in California today. The custom-made jacket boasts 11 gold police-style badges and dozens of silver buckles and crests. It will be sold with the 50-year-old singer's tight leather pants and a flamboyant belt. Other celebrity items up for grabs at the auction include Marilyn Monroe's bathing suit, a purple outfit worn by Elton John onstage and items belonging to Elvis Presley. Jimi Hendrix's Purple Haze pouch bag, John Lennon's dressing gown and Madonna's police hat will also be sold at the auction.</p>
<p>Dita and the Count</p>
<p>Dita Von Teese is dating a French aristocrat 11 years her junior. The burlesque dancer -- who is divorced from goth rocker Marilyn Manson -- is enjoying a romance with 25-year-old Count Louis-Marie de Castelbajac, whose parents are fashion designer Jean-Charles de Castelbajac and Catherine de Castelbajac. A source close to Dita, 36, said: "The age gap doesn't seem to be a problem at the moment, he's very mature for his age."</p>

<p>Re: 'Swine flu' label leaves bad taste for some faiths' (April 28)</p>
<p>An Israeli health official wants to rename the swine flu. His says it is insensitive to the Jewish and Muslim populations. He wants to rename it "Mexican influenza."</p>
<p>It seems self-centred, not caring about how this new name affects those from Mexico.</p>
<p>As well, no one is considering the interests of the poor animals involved. I recommend calling this the "large farm animal" flu, thus keeping it general enough to be politically correct and not isolating any species, animal or human.</p>

<p>It may be that the greatest effect on Canada of the worldwide swine flu outbreak will be the need for us to assist other countries.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus does not seem to be having the lethal consequences outside of Mexico as in that country; while it is believed responsible for 168 deaths there (at press time), the only swine-flu death in any other country was a Mexican child who became infected in his own country before travelling to Texas where he died.</p>
<p>The sense of alarm that arrived with first news of the swine flu outbreak has eased slightly; the fullness of time does put things into perspective. Communications and co-operation between international health agencies has been excellent and -- by and large -- there is a sense of cautious optimism. Governments in Canada and the U.S. are better prepared than they were just a few years ago.</p>
<p>None of this means that Canada, or the U.S., is "safe" from swine flu. One science/medical theory is that the death toll and number of hospitalizations in Mexico represents only a small fraction of people who have been infected there. If the virus was to became as rampant in other countries, the theory concludes, they too would see climbing fatality numbers. But there may be other mitigating factors such as public-health standards and effectiveness, the general health of the population, or even just that other countries had time to start screening and public-hygiene protocols.</p>
<p>But following that line of reasoning leads to the worrisome realization that the H1N1 virus has not -- yet -- surfaced in Africa or Asia, where population densities are higher than in the West and where many people's health is already compromised by nutrition, hygiene or existing disease issues. Medical care is harder to come by and supplies of antiviral medications range from slim to non-existent.</p>
<p>That may -- and we stress may -- create a situation where Canada can offer help in ameliorating H1N1 outbreaks or treating patients.</p>
<p>For all that, it must be said that there are way too many people -- many of them with no real knowledge -- speculating publicly on what happens next. "We have lots of scenariologists," Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer said this week. He said the public should avoid blogs and other sites where unreliable posters are speculating about the flu.</p>
<p>There's a good side to the almost instant availability of information in a situation such as this: medical agencies can share information and create co-ordinated responses quickly enough to get ahead of the virus. But the bad side is that anyone with a blog or a website can ramp up fear, pass along dangerous misinformation -- including denying that there is a problem. Regardless of what is yet to unfold, the World Health Organization has said it is on the verge of declaring a pandemic, the first one since 1968.</p>
<p>There's no room yet for sighs of relief: Things may get worse before they get better, both nationally and internationally. There are still long days ahead for public health officials. But the time may be approaching when Canada can look to see where it can help others.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>A bid to rebrand the swine flu virus to clarify that pigs aren't spreading it to humans may create more confusion than it clears, several public health experts, including the man who helped named the Ebola virus, said yesterday.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization announced it would stop using the term "swine flu," a nickname that has angered pork producers and led to a drop in pork sales worldwide.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Prime Minister Stephen Harper referred to it as the Mexican flu.</p>
<p>And Alberto Lozano, spokesman for the Mexican embassy in Ottawa, said the name that the Mexican government is using is H1N1.</p>
<p>"That's the scientific name provided by the World Health Organization," he said. "For us, that's the name of it."</p>
<p>Dr. Karl Johnson, a retired American scientist who led the response to the first known Ebola outbreak, said "political correctness" was going to confuse science and the public.</p>
<p>"It's called swine flu because of what is known and knowable about the virus," said Johnson, former head of special pathogens at the U.S. Centers from Disease Control.</p>
<p>Johnson said calling it a swine flu virus, shortened by the media and most others to swine flu, is in keeping with the accepted nomenclature of influenza, adding it was "crazy" to try to drop references to swine from the name.</p>
<p>WHO spokesperson Dick Thompson said the Geneva-based agency would refer to the virus simply as influenza A(H1N1).</p>
<p>The change comes after the agriculture industry and the UN food agency expressed concerns that the term was misleading consumers and needlessly causing countries to order the slaughter of pigs, he said.</p>
<p>"Rather than calling this swine flu ... we're going to stick with the technical scientific name H1N1 influenza A."</p>
<p>Incredulous scientists retorted that there is already an influenza A(H1N1) virus that has been circulating among humans for decades. That virus caused the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. It has spread among people for all but 20 years since 1918 and is the milder of today's circulating human influenza A viruses.</p>
<p>When flu diagnostic tests look for H1N1 virus, it is for the human subtype that they are searching. And one of the three components in the seasonal flu shot protects against the human H1N1 viruses but not, early research suggests, against the swine H1N1.</p>
<p>The notion that the public, the health-care profession and the research community would be left without a way to distinguish between a garden variety flu subtype and the one that may trigger the next pandemic is unworkable, said Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Diseases Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>
<p>"That's nuts," said Osterholm of the suggested new name. "We've got to get a better name.</p>
<p>"They've got to do something to distinguish it from the seasonal flu."</p>
<p>Pork producers, U.S. administration officials and the WHO's sister agencies for animal health, the International Organization for Animal Health and the Food and Agriculture Organization have all objected to the term swine flu.</p>
<p>They have argued that it creates the false impression that pigs are transmitting viruses to people on an ongoing basis or that eating pork products can lead to swine flu infection. Both of those are untrue.</p>
<p>In Egypt, 300,000 pigs were destroyed this week, apparently in response to the perceived threat.</p>
<p>The outbreak, now confirmed in 11 countries, is caused by a novel swine influenza virus that is a hybrid of two strains of swine viruses plus genes from avian and human flu viruses.</p>
<p>WHO and others have said that pigs don't factor into the equation when one is looking at transmission patterns now.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian officials announced a torrent of new confirmed swine flu cases yesterday but maintained the symptoms are mild and the new numbers were anticipated.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper assured the public that governments around the world are working together on the issue, even as Canada's caseload almost doubled to 34 with 15 new confirmations, including the first in Quebec.</p>
<p>"Thankfully, all cases in Canada continue to be mild," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference in Ottawa.</p>
<p>"I repeat again these new cases were anticipated and do not affect our approach."</p>
<p>One notable change in approach, however, was announced yesterday.</p>
<p>Harper presaged the move when he alluded to the outbreak as the "Mexican flu" during a news conference in Toronto yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, later told reporters in the capital that the virus will no longer be referred to as swine flu, but instead will be called the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the change is being made "to make it very clear that this disease is not spread from pigs or from either pork or pork products."</p>
<p>Harper plans to visit a Saskatchewan farm today, where that point will likely be driven home. Pork producers have taken a beating as consumers -- and some foreign governments -- have reacted irrationally to the spreading swine flu</p>
<p>So far, officials are tracing most cases of the virus to travellers to Mexico, although eight Canadian cases in all were not recent travellers to the country. Health officials are keeping a keen watch for what may be secondary infections as a signal to whether the virus is becoming established in the human population.</p>
<p>"In Canada now, within the school setting, possibly we're at sort of third generation or so -- that is a person infecting another infecting another," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>Quebec health officials said yesterday the province's first confirmed case is a person from the Montreal area who was in Mexico recently and is now at home with a mild case of the flu.</p>
<p>Of the 15 new cases reported yesterday, five were in B.C., four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario and one in Quebec. They are all considered mild.</p>
<p>But wary health officials in B.C. closed an elementary school in the Okanagan after a student was diagnosed with a mild case of the swine flu. Officials said it was a precaution to keep the virus from spreading to the other 500 students at the French immersion school.</p>
<p>With the threat level of a global flu pandemic raised to five on a scale of six Wednesday, one step short of a full pandemic, the prime minister attempted to calm public fears during his appearance in Toronto.</p>
<p>"People should rest assured that governments around the world are responding to this in an appropriate and co-ordinated way," said Harper.</p>
<p>"And I speak not just of the federal government and its provincial counterparts, but governments across the world are co-ordinating their actions and co-ordinating them with international health authorities, and I believe we are doing what is necessary at the moment."</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert also sought to calm the furor over the H1N1 virus yesterday when asked if the province has any plans other than daily briefings to keep the public from overreacting.</p>
<p>"Other than trying to communicate to folks like you (the media) that 'Live life normally,"' Liepert said.</p>
<p>"There are no other plans. We have got a plan in place. We have got our officials working. Things are under control. So anything that goes beyond that is basically hype and rumour."</p>
<p>Liepert said Alberta has no plans yet to stop crowds from gathering at sporting events, festivals and the upcoming tourism season.</p>
<p>"It is different than Mexico City where they have decided where they won't have fans at soccer games," he said.</p>
<p>"But Mexico City is in the heart of where this influenza has developed. We are in a very different situation than that."</p>
<p>Liepert said people should not overreact to the few cases in Alberta: "Live your life normal ... we are talking about six Albertans out of 3.5 million Albertans."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu sabotages Molitor's title shot; Outbreak postpones fighter's bout for chance to be top IBF contender</b>
</div><div>Morgan Campbell   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>540 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Steve Molitor is facing a major delay in his quest to regain a world title, and his promoter says swine flu is to blame.</p>
<p>Molitor, scheduled to fight Mexico's Heriberto Ruiz on June 26, has not been in contact with the virus.</p>
<p>But he had been scheduled to fight a six-round tuneup bout tonight in Merida, Mexico before the continued spread of the disease prompted his promoters, Orion Sports Management, to postpone the event.</p>
<p>Promoter Allan Tremblay delayed his decision as long as possible, but couldn't receive assurance last week from the local boxing commission that they would let the show happen.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure of the seriousness (of the outbreak), and it was in a different part of Mexico," Tremblay said. "We just wanted to go down and get (Molitor) a win."</p>
<p>But with the flu spreading - about 160 people in Mexico have died from it so far - Tremblay decided Sunday night to postpone.</p>
<p>Molitor, who held the IBF 122-pound title for two years, has had fights fall through before but this complicates his situation.</p>
<p>Cancelling the tuneup bout doesn't knock Molitor out of line for a title shot, but it could make the line a lot longer.</p>
<p>In November, Panamanian Celestino Caballero flattened Molitor in four rounds to claim the IBF crown. Molitor's camp planned to match him with Ruiz next month in a "title eliminator," which gives the winner the No.1 ranking and the next shot at the IBF belt.</p>
<p>Caballero, who is also the WBA champ, was scheduled to defend both titles last night against South Africa's Jeffrey Mathebula.</p>
<p>The problem for Molitor is that IBF rules prevent fighters coming off knockout losses from competing in title eliminators, so winning a six-rounder against a hand-picked opponent was supposed to keep Molitor eligible for the top ranking. Without that win, Molitor and Ruiz will now fight for the No.2 ranking, while the IBF will order two other top-10 junior featherweights to fight in an eliminator for the top spot.</p>
<p>The winner will then fight for the title while Molitor, assuming he defeats Ruiz, will wait his turn.</p>
<p>"You have to fight to get to those two spots. We don't just let anybody in," said IBF championship chairman Lindsey Tucker. "With us, No.2 fights two times (to reach a title bout) ... Molitor could end up waiting a considerable time to fight for the title."</p>
<p>How long still isn't clear.</p>
<p>The winner of last night's fight between Caballero and Mathebula will have nine months to defend the IBF crown but must also navigate the WBA's schedule.</p>
<p>Molitor's best chance to fight for a title before the end of the year would be if Caballero defeats Mathebula then follows through on speculation that he will move to a higher weight class. With Caballero vacating the title, the top two contenders would then fight for the belt. But Molitor would still need to defeat Ruiz in June to make that happen.</p>

</p>
<p>It's not quite a foreign language, but the lexicon of pandemics does have a certain elitist twang to it. Since you'll be hearing these words a lot in the days ahead, you might as well get familiar with them:</p>
<p>Pandemic:</p>
<p>The global outbreak of disease. In the case of flu, it refers to a new variety that has not previously infected humans so there is no natural immunity. Flu pandemics typically occur every 10 to 50 years. Epidemics are outbreaks in focused geographic regions whereas pandemics affect the entire world.</p>
<p>Social Distancing:</p>
<p>Efforts to reduce the spread of flu by minimizing group gatherings. Closing schools and workplaces aim to stop those who have the virus from infecting others.</p>
<p>Antivirals:</p>
<p>Medicines used to treat flu, called antivirals because they work to counter the flu virus. Two flu medicines, Tamiflu and Relenza, appear effective against swine flu but only work if started within 48 hours of first symptoms. Past studies show they merely shorten illness by about one day.</p>
<p>Little is known about whether these medicines cut the chances of complications such as pneumonia and few have been tested on children.</p>
<p>Containment:</p>
<p>An attempt to snuff out a possible pandemic at its source. To do this, health officials would rush flu medicines to the epicentre of the outbreak. Doctors would treat sick people and give medicines protectively to those who are not sick. Most experts think containment is logistically impossible, but efforts could slow down the pandemic's spread.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>1976 swine flu story swung from fear to farce</b>
</div><div>Thomas Walkom   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>617 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Let's keep things in perspective. Yes, there is a potentially deadly strain of swine flu spreading around the globe. No, it's not necessarily the end of the world.</p>
<p>First, the facts. So far, only 13 people are confirmed dead from swine flu according to the World Health Organization - 12 in Mexico and one in the U.S. Around the world, 497 cases of the flu have been confirmed, including 34 in Canada.</p>
<p>Mexico suspects the virus may have already killed 168 people. Others there (the reported numbers range from 2,500 to 6,000) are showing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>But even if these numbers stand up, they, too, should be seen in context. All influenza is potentially deadly. In a normal year, between 6,500 and 7,500 Mexicans die from pneumonia-like diseases. According to the Canadian Medical Association Journal, the flu kills up to 2,500 Canadians and about 36,000 Americans annually. Worldwide, the number of deaths attributed to the flu each year is between 250,000 and 500,000.</p>
<p>So, yes, there have been deaths from this flu variant. There will almost certainly be more. But, relatively speaking, we're still in the realm of low numbers. What's more telling - so far, at least - is that most who contracted this strain of the virus have recovered quickly.</p>
<p>Flu outbreaks always raise memories of the epidemic of 1918. That year, the so-called Spanish flu killed somewhere up to 50 million people worldwide. In Canada, an estimated 45,000 died.</p>
<p>But history provides other examples as well. My favourite is the great swine flu panic of 1976.</p>
<p>That one, too, began with fear and fanfare when, in February, a 19-year-old U.S. army recruit at Fort Dix, N.J., died after contracting a mysterious strain of swine flu.</p>
<p>Politicians swung into action. Faced with the spectre of another 1918-style pandemic, then-U.S. president Gerald Ford promised to inoculate every American citizen with vaccine. The Canadian government followed suit, with the proviso that - because of the cost involved - it would be able to inoculate only some.</p>
<p>Throughout 1976, the swine flu story swung between fear and farce. In August, Ontario's health minister announced the province's first swine flu death, a Goderich man. This, as it turned out, was untrue. A coroner later determined that the victim, who choked on his on vomit, had never been infected.</p>
<p>At Queen's Park, politicians debated who would get the scarce vaccine. All agreed on police officers and doctors. But should bank tellers be vaccinated? And what about bus drivers?</p>
<p>In the U.S., Nobel Prize-winning scientist Linus Pauling argued that Vitamin C would fight swine flu better than any vaccine. Here at home, the Toronto Star helpfully suggested that those inoculated against the virus should be required to give up the right to strike.</p>
<p>Ontario's government hemmed and hawed until, in the end, it decided to offer the vaccine to anyone who wanted it.</p>
<p>Alas, few did. By December, the Star reported that municipal clinics set up in Toronto to offer free flu shots were shutting down for lack of customers. Which perhaps was just as well. For when several Americans developed a mysterious and deadly paralysis after being inoculated, swine flu shots were abruptly suspended in both countries.</p>
<p>In the end, the only known death from the 1976 swine flu pandemic was the original army recruit. Outside of Fort Dix, only two other people caught the bug. They both recovered.</p>
<p>Thomas Walkom's column usually appears Wednesday and Saturday.</p>

<p>Durham public health officials insist three young women diagnosed with swine flu were advised to stay home and follow proper procedures to reduce the risk of spreading it.</p>
<p>"Our understanding is the hospital (Lakeridge Health at Port Perry) asked them to stay home," Ross MacEachern, manager with the environmental health division, said yesterday. "They were discharged because they were not ill enough to be admitted."</p>
<p>But the mother of one of the young women says no such instructions were given. "No one told them to stay home," said Barb Stevenson, whose daughter, Justine, 21, has been diagnosed with a mild case.</p>
<p>"The doctor knew they had symptoms but said they were good to go."</p>
<p>The three Port Perry women returned from a holiday in Cancun on Friday with symptoms of the flu and went straight to the hospital. An emergency room doctor took chest X-rays, tested them for influenza, called Durham public health officials but sent them home without instructions, Stevenson said.</p>
<p>The three didn't know they had the flu so they went to the casino in Port Perry on Saturday night.</p>
<p>On Monday, Durham public health officials told them they had tested positive for influenza A. Late Tuesday, they got information they had swine flu.</p>
<p>"I was very angry when I heard that," Stevenson said.</p>
<p>"They should have been told from Day 1 to exercise precaution. Is this how the province is handling the situation?"</p>
<p>Stevenson runs a daycare from her home in Port Perry and says she told health officials about it.</p>
<p>"They just told me to make sure Justine stays away from the kids."</p>
<p>MacEachern said public health officials followed up with the women Monday.</p>
<p>They were not quarantined because "they had mild symptoms and if they practised good hygiene there was no reason to believe it could lead to a crisis."</p>

<p>Every crisis begets an artistic response. In the case of the swine flu pandemic, the world is seeing an instant response in music.</p>
<p>"Swine flu, swine flu. I'm freaked out, what about you?" sings Jonathan Mann on YouTube in Swine Flu: The Musical.</p>
<p>Two clever minds have translated into music the genetic code of the swine flu virus's two main proteins: hemagglutinin and neuraminidase.</p>
<p>With the help of an algorithm, San Francisco photographer and science geek Stephan Zielinski translated DNA code into a piece called "Swine Flu Hemagglutinin."</p>
<p>Chris Thomas, a British scientist, has weighed in on YouTube with "Eine Kleine Influenza Musik," a piece of electronic music based on the genetic code of neuraminidase.</p>
<p>Zielinski's MP3 file has captured attention since he posted it to his blog (stephan-zielinski.com) on Tuesday. The slow, spare, random-sounding piece comes across as an example of ambient music.</p>
<p>Zielinski says his aim was to help understand the virus by translating its code into music and, by hearing it, perhaps shed some light on it.</p>
<p>Alas, he said the experiment failed as he did not find a significant pattern.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada sees 34 cases all mild; Toronto case reported; more are expected as results from swabs become available</b>
</div><div>Tanya Talaga and Joanna Smith   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>922 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Swine flu continues to march across Canada with 34 confirmed, but mild, cases in five provinces - and infectious disease experts say this may be the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>In Vernon, B.C., 500 students at a French immersion elementary school were sent home for the week after a classmate tested positive after a trip to Mexico. It's the first school closing reported in Canada.</p>
<p>The student is experiencing a mild case of swine flu and is recovering at home, said Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s provincial health officer.</p>
<p>Toronto reported its first case yesterday, bringing the number of confirmed cases in Ontario to eight. Health officials said the Toronto case is a young man who caught the flu in Mexico and has recovered.</p>
<p>But more cases are expected as test results from nasal swab samples become available. "There is a good probability we have other cases," said Dr. Barbara Yaffe, director of communicable disease control with Toronto public health.</p>
<p>All eight Greater Toronto residents who caught the virus recently travelled to Mexico. None required hospital care for their mild flu-like symptoms, said Dr. David Williams, the provincial acting chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"I take some confidence so far in the Canadian experience (that) we haven't seen the severe picture that is in Mexico," Williams said.</p>
<p>In Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak, at least 168 people have died, with 12 confirmed as swine flu and the rest suspected. Mexicans are being urged to stay at home during the holiday long weekend in order to halt the spread of the illness.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization does not feel it is necessary to ramp up the global pandemic alert to Phase 6, its highest level, said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, WHO assistant director. On Wednesday, the WHO raised the global alert to Phase 5 and told countries to prepare, as they feel a pandemic is imminent.</p>
<p>"Phase 5 holds steady and there is no evidence to suggest a move to Phase 6," Fukuda said in a teleconference call from Geneva. "The situation continues to evolve."</p>
<p>Canada has followed the WHO's lead and changed the name from swine flu to H1N1 flu virus to make it clear the disease is not spread through pigs or pork products.</p>
<p>WHO spokesperson Dick Thompson said the agriculture industry and the UN food agency had expressed concerns that the term "swine flu" was misleading consumers and needlessly causing countries to ban pork products and order the slaughter of pigs.</p>
<p>The swine flu virus originated in pigs, and has genes from human, bird and pig viruses. Scientists don't know exactly how it jumped to humans. In the current outbreak, WHO says the virus is being spread from human to human, not from contact with infected pigs.</p>
<p>In Ontario, there is still no evidence of person-to-person spread of the virus, but in Nova Scotia, officials believe students have caught it from one another.</p>
<p>In Canada, there have been 15 new confirmed cases since Wednesday, bringing the total to 34. British Columbia has five new cases, Alberta four, there are another four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>The four new cases in Nova Scotia are related to an original cluster of four cases among students at a private boarding school in Windsor. The students who originally had the virus have recovered and returned to class at King's-Edgehill School. All the cases involved students who returned from Mexico earlier this month.</p>
<p>The rise in Canadian cases was anticipated and will not change the federal approach to how the illness is managed, said Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>Canada is also talking with pharmaceutical company <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> about manufacturing a vaccine for the virus.</p>
<p>At this point, the WHO does not feel travel restrictions will slow down movement of the virus. But if someone feels ill, they should "strongly consider delaying that travel," said Fukuda.</p>
<p>As flu season comes to a close in the Northern Hemisphere, it is just beginning in the Southern Hemisphere, with its poorer countries. The WHO is now distributing antiviral drugs to developing countries and Mexico.</p>
<p>Globally, the case count continues to rise. Switzerland and the Netherlands became the latest countries to report infections.</p>
<p>The U.S. caseload topped 130 as hundreds of schools nationwide shut their doors. The crisis even reached the White House, which said an aide to the energy secretary apparently got sick helping arrange a presidential trip to Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said new cases have levelled off and the death rate has been nearly flat for several days.</p>
<p>"The fact that we have a stabilization in the daily numbers, even a drop, makes us optimistic," he said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization's top flu official sounded a cautious note about whether the virus had peaked.</p>
<p>"For things to go up and down in a country is expected. If it didn't do that it would be very unusual," Fukuda said. "Hopefully we'll see more of the data of what's going on there. But I expect even in Mexico you will see a mixed picture."</p>

<p>Book on Arctic wins Donner prize</p>
<p>Arctic Front: Defending the Far North claimed the $35,000 Donner Prize for the best book on Canadian public policy at the Carlu Theatre last night.</p>
<p>The book, which outlines how Canadian governments have neglected sovereignty issues in the country's arctic region, was co-authored by four professors: Ken S. Coates, P. Whitney Lackenbauer, William R. Morrison and Greg Poelzer.</p>
<p>"Unquestionably, this book deals with a subject of major public importance and interest," said jury chair Grant Reuber. The finalists, chosen from 69 entries, included Tarek Fatah's Chasing a Mirage: The Tragic Illusion of an Islamic State; Bruce Little's Fixing the Future: How Canada's Usually Fractious Governments Worked Together to Rescue the Canada Pension Plan; Andrew Sancton's The Limits of Boundaries: Why City-regions Cannot be Self-governing; and Frances Widdowson and Albert Howard's Disrobing the Aboriginal Industry: The Deception Behind Indigenous Cultural Preservation. Each of the runners-up received $5,000.</p>

<p>MEXICO CITY -- Sewage-filled lagoons at a pig farm in eastern Mexico - a product of the North American free trade deal - are suspected of creating ground zero conditions for swine flu in this country.</p>
<p>Environmentalists argue lax regulations in the factory farming that boomed in Mexico right after the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and the U.S. are making people sick - and not just with swine flu.</p>
<p>"You might call this the 'NAFTA flu,'" said Rick Arnold, co-ordinator of Common Frontiers, a Canadian coalition focusing on Latin America and issues of economic integration.</p>
<p>He argues multinationals are getting away with dire conditions not allowed north of the border.</p>
<p>Environmental groups three years ago began protesting against operations at the Carroll Farms in Veracruz, jointly operated by U.S. pork giant Smithfield Farms.</p>
<p>The first confirmed case of swine flu originated with a 5-year-old boy from the town of La Gloria, near the farm. He recovered.</p>
<p>Medical officials have not pinpointed where the outbreak began.</p>
<p>And from its Virginia headquarters, Smithfield officials insist there is no evidence linking their operations to the disease.</p>
<p>Smithfield Farms, the world's largest pork producer with $12 billion in annual sales, opened Carroll Farms in 1994, calling it a "joint venture.</p>
<p>At home, the company was fined $12.6 million (U.S.) in 1997 after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency disclosed it was dumping raw pig sewage into a river flowing into Chesapeake Bay.</p>
<p>The health ministry, which earlier said 168 people were believed killed by swine flu in Mexico, yesterday would confirm only 12 of those deaths as being from swine flu and would not say how many more cases were suspected.</p>
<p>The air in Mexico City, once called the "most polluted" by the World Health Organization, is loaded with human fecal matter, gases, dust and other toxic materials.</p>
<p>"The pollution affects our eyes, throats and lungs," said Dr. Erendira Gallardo Lobera, a general practitioner. She said the Mexican government should take stronger measures to ensure residents of the capital aren't breathing in rat and dog feces with their oxygen.</p>
<p>While Mexicans continue to wear masks and stay indoors in a country virtually shut down, people say the government should be more forthcoming with information.</p>
<p>"I think the government isn't giving us the correct statistics about infected cases," said restaurant employee Jose Gutierrez Hernandez. "I fear there's not enough medicine to control this outbreak and there is no vaccine against swine flu."</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon promised his officials would provide timely information, adding as a "parent and as a person, there is nothing more important to me than the life and health of the Mexican people."</p>
<p>From the Mexican embassy in Ottawa, spokesperson Alberto Lozano Merino said Mexican authorities are not concerned with pig farm operations near the suspected epicentre of the swine flu outbreak. Authorities acted quickly to send Veracruz samples to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Ga., and have "followed every regulation and protocol."</p>
<p>However, the Veracruz newspaper La Marcha, as well as the Mexico City daily, La Jornada, reported widespread cases of people falling ill near the pig farm in March.</p>
<p>Several local groups argue the farms should be closed pending extensive environmental and health reviews of an operation that raises 950,000 pigs a year and doesn't have a sewage treatment plant.</p>
<p>In a 2006 article on Smithfield's Virginia operations, Rolling Stone reported: "(The) pigs live by the hundreds or thousands in warehouse-like barns, in rows of wall-to-wall pens (and) trample each other to death.</p>
<p>"The floors are slatted to allow excrement to fall into a catchment pit under the pens, but many things besides excrement can wind up in the pits: afterbirths, piglets accidentally crushed by their mothers, old batteries, broken bottles of insecticide, antibiotic syringes, stillborn pigs ..."</p>
<p>The article said the "pipes remain closed until enough sewage accumulates in the pits to create good expulsion pressure; then the pipes are opened and everything bursts out into a large holding pond."</p>
<p>Yesterday, La Jornada ran a photo of a large waste-filled lagoon at Carroll Farms in Veracruz. A caption under the photo says farm officials stress the pork waste flowing into the lagoon generates "absolutely no type of contamination."</p>
<p>C. Larry Pope, president and CEO of Smithfield Farms, sent a letter yesterday assuring all employees the company is doing everything possible "and will continue to do so (to keep) our workers and pigs healthy."</p>

</p>
<p>The growing media coverage of swine flu comes at an inconvenient time for the shaky stock market.</p>
<p>With the first death in the United States reported thisweek,we're even starting to see the word "pandemic" used in news reports, though I'm not at all sure it's appropriate at this juncture.</p>
<p>As part of the media, I tend to be skeptical about knee-jerk reactions to whatever is the crisis of the day.</p>
<p>As a stock investor, my natural tendency to buy-and-hold for the long run also makes me reluctant to respond to such "noise." Indeed, in his Inner Circle bulletins and subsequently on Twitter, investment counsellor Patrick McKeough reassured his flock with these words: " I doubt that swine flu poses an investment risk. Health authorities are just erring on the side of caution." The new CanadianMoneyForum.com has an ongoing discussion entitled Swine Flu Effects on the Market. There's no question that individual stocks and sectors can be impacted in the short term: the initial market reaction was to cause aviation stocks to fall (not good for travel) but for pharmaceutical stocks to rise, especially those that make flu vaccines(such as <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.) <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span> makes the Purell hand cleaner. Swine stocks fell initially and one would expect that publicly traded makers of white maskswould rise, such as 3M, which is reputed to make the best N95 respiratory mask.</p>
<p>Canadian investors may feel they've seen this movie before with the SARS virus in 2003. But most investors would agree SARS was somewhat overblown. The two are not the same. SARS was largely a hospitalacquired infection and never really spread to the population at large.</p>
<p>Swine fluis a travel-related infection.</p>
<p>Of course, the media had a field day with SARS and, here in 2009, swine flu and those photos of Mexicans in masks are certainly minuteby- minute fodder for blogs and the incessant torrent of information that passes through social networking sites like Twitter and <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>.</p>
<p>It's possible the intense coverage will amplify what otherwise would have been a minor impact on the market, but the strong performance of the market this week -- it closed basically flat yesterday -- seems to vindicate the "don't worry, be happy" crowd.</p>
<p>Some wily investment contrarians are even considering investing in the casualties of swine flu, such as Mexican airport operator, Grupo Aeroportuario Del Sure (ASR.) In his Stingy Investor newsletter, valueoriented stock-picker Norman Rothery points out the Spanish flu of 1918 had little impact on the S&P500 index.</p>
<p>All in all, I see no reason to factor swine flu into any investment action.</p>
<p>Over the long run, this is likely to be a blip.</p>
<p>If you're broadly invested in the market, perhaps through index funds, then I'd expect the gains in certain sectors to be offset by losses in others withno real net impact.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean all the other things stock market investors worry about don't still need to be considered.</p>
<p>Contagion is an ongoing concern but I'm not talking about swine flu. Rather I'm referring to the ongoing credit crisis and a book entitled Contagion, written by John Talbott, who predicted the housing crash in another book. It talks about the "financial epidemic that is sweeping the global economy." Now that's scary.</p>

<p>U.S. Vice-President Joe Biden is in trouble for unnerving the public by saying he wouldn't travel in planes or subways now because of swine flu. But a Canadian expert on the airborne movement of germs says Biden has a point.</p>
<p>"He's right, but I'm not sure it's the role of the politician to necessarily say anything that makes people panic in this," says Dr. James Scott, a professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.</p>
<p>"If you're sitting adjacent or in proximity to someone who is shedding virus in that enclosed indoor environment, the potential to be exposed to stuff is much greater than it is outdoors."</p>
<p>If he were to do what Biden advises against and get on a plane, "I would probably take some surgical masks with me," Scott says. "I don't think there's any reason not to. Even if it gives me only five per cent less likelihood of having the virus, it's not that uncomfortable."</p>
<p>Canadians are watching a possible pandemic unfold before their eyes. The number of confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada soared Thursday, with another 13 cases reported -- four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, three in British Columbia and one each in Ontario and Quebec. The national number now stands at 32.</p>
<p>Health officials are advising people to take "personal action" -- cover your nose and mouth when you cough or sneeze, wash your hands frequently and stay home if you are sick. But should people get flu shots, or wear face masks? Is air travel safe?</p>
<p>"If you are at terrible risk of dying of even a mild respiratory infection, (air travel) is probably a bad thing to do," says Dr. Dalius Briedis, director of clinical infectious diseases at the Royal Victoria Hospital and a researcher in the department of microbiology at McGill University. "I think you should avoid public areas in general, not just planes and things. You shouldn't be in a crowded movie theatre or supermarket, either.</p>
<p>"If you're a relatively healthy person, I think it's far and away overkill to avoid travelling."</p>
<p>This year's flu shot protects against the human strain of H1N1 influenza, "but we have absolutely no idea of whether it provides any partial or significant protection" against human swine H1N1 influenza, Briedis says.</p>
<p>Scott says the flu shot is a "hedge bet" against several different flu strains. "It's the best thing you can do right now to decrease your chances of getting the flu. It's not going to hit this flu. But what you aren't hearing is there are lots of cases of influenza A. This isn't the one and only flu that is in existence right now."</p>
<p>As well, those circulating viruses can swap genes back and forth. "If you can prevent getting infected with the normal flu, it may decrease the possibility of exchanging, making a new sub-variant" of human swine flu, says University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown.</p>
<p>Influenza affects millions of Canadians each year, resulting in 20,000 admissions to hospital, on average, and 4,000 deaths, mostly among the elderly, very young and immune compromised.</p>
<p>The swine-flu strain appears to be susceptible to the mainline anti-flu drug, Tamiflu. There are government and hospital stockpiles, but supplies are going to private pharmacies as well. Briedis says people are filling prescriptions for Tamiflu who are not sick.</p>
<p>"The pharmacist told me this stuff is flying off the shelves. He was re-ordering every day. If this is going to be a real pandemic, we're going to need all the Tamiflu we can get."</p>

</p>
<p>The swine flu panic sweeping across North America and the rest of the world is the latest in a long series of battles that mankind as had with microbes over the years.</p>
<p>The damn things keep evolving and we have to react with stronger immune systems. The potential swine flu pandemic could be an over-hyped story or the real thing. Only time will tell.</p>
<p>First Nations people have had a long history with epidemics. The past 500 years have been disastrous, with smallpox, cholera, tuberculosis, measles and bubonic plague sweeping through the indigenous population of the Americas.</p>
<p>The first people of the Americas had no history of these diseases and consequently their immune systems were not responsive. The result was widespread suffering and death. This disaster was repeated wherever indigenous populations previously had lived in isolation from European contact. Indigenous peoples of Hawaii, the South Sea islands, New Zealand and Australia all would suffer the same fate as the peoples of the Americas.</p>
<p>The Spanish brought smallpox to Mexico in 1520, and over the next several centuries the disease would spread across the continent and ravage the aboriginal population. It then spread across the Caribbean to kill more than a million Arawak people, effectively wiping out the population. From there it moved on to Mexico and the Yucatan, and into South America. It is estimated that 200,000 people in the Inca Empire died of the disease.</p>
<p>In Canada, early fur traders reported whole villages reduced to a few people. In most cases the mortality rate of the disease was estimated to be 95 per cent.</p>
<p>Indian Head in southern Saskatchewan takes its name from a camp that was destroyed by smallpox. All the people had died and their remains were scattered around by coyotes and other scavengers. Among the grisly remains were a number of disembodied heads.</p>
<p>The conquest of the Americas was not really a conquest, but rather a trip into an empty land. Historians call the Americas virgin territory. The land was not a virgin, it was a widow. Disease depopulated the Americas to the point that the Spanish were forced to look to Africa for slaves.</p>
<p>People today are comparing the swine flu from Mexico with the "Spanish flu" pandemic of 1918 -- the worst in history. It was a global disaster that claimed more lives than the First World War. It is estimated that between 20 million and 40 million people died as the result of the pandemic. It took three years for the Black Death to do as much damage in Europe.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu took a terrible toll on the aboriginal population in Canada, leaving in its wake only 105,000 Indian people -- the lowest population in our history. Today there are more than 750,000 First Nations people in Canada.</p>
<p>My Dad was born in 1918, during the height of pandemic. His birth date is not known, although his mother told him he was born after the war and before Christmas. In any event, he was whisked away to the church and baptized on the same day he was born because the flu epidemic was raging at the time.</p>
<p>Rev. Edward Ahenakew, an Anglican minister from the Ahtahkakoop Reserve, was living at Onion Lake during the pandemic. His journal describes the devastation: "The church was piled high with bodies. On the reserves so many people were dying that mass burials and funerals were being held."</p>
<p>The experience so touched him that he moved to Edmonton and studied medicine at the University of Alberta. Unfortunately, poor health got in his way of completing the program.</p>
<p>About a decade ago, a crew excavating to place a tank at a gas station in La Ronge unearthed human remains. The contractor informed the elders and they discovered a mass grave from the 1918 pandemic. There were about 30 bodies, some in caskets and others wrapped in blankets, indicating the haste in which the bodies were buried. It was another sober reminder of the flu pandemic and its impact on our people.</p>
<p>Our people still remain susceptible to diseases at abnormally high rates. Diseases such as diabetes and AIDS, called modern day epidemics, have a devastating effect on our comparatively small population.</p>
<p>Swine flu is now on the rise across the world, and indications are that it might be a pandemic. But we must keep in mind that this is not 1918. We now have tools to fight back; antibiotics, vaccinations and other treatments will lessen the negative effects. However, those in the developing world have little access to modern technologies and the impact of the flu could be greater on them than us.</p>
<p>Many indigenous people live in crowded conditions, where poverty and disease are a way of life. The results of this potential pandemic may well have a greater effect on our people, as did the pandemic of 1918. Let's hope the disease is being over-hyped and will have a limited effect. But if it does take off, we must remember that we've been down this path before and we will persevere.</p>

<p>A little extra cleaning and lessons in cough and sneeze etiquette are on the agenda for Saskatoon students in the wake of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>However, it appears Saskatoon schools will not yet be cancelling any student trips, which some school divisions in Alberta and Quebec have done.</p>
<p>Both Saskatoon Public Schools and Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools say their students have no international trips scheduled for the rest of the school year.</p>
<p>The Catholic division is asking all of its schools to tell administrators about any out-of-province trips they plan to take, superintendent of education and human resource services Al Boutin says.</p>
<p>"At this point, there are no plans to restrict travel," he said. "It's something where we need to work closely with health officials in determining any risk to our students and that will be our guiding factor in determining whether or not we'd put any restrictions on travel."</p>
<p>Both Saskatoon school divisions already have pandemic plans and have been distributing copies to school administrators, students and parents this week.</p>
<p>Both divisions have also instructed their caretakers to increase cleaning and disinfecting in places where germs are easily spread.</p>
<p>Students are also being reminded about good infection control etiquette, such as frequent hand-washing with warm water and soap, sneezing and coughing into their elbows, not their hands, keeping their distance from people who have flu-like symptoms and staying home if they are sick.</p>
<p>Like the school divisions, a group of key University of Saskatchewan administrators are also meeting regularly in case the swine flu outbreak escalates, says David Hannah, co-chair of the U of- crisis management team.</p>
<p>The final exam period ended Wednesday and there are few students on campus. The spring semester begins May 13, leaving a couple of weeks for administrators to set plans into place.</p>
<p>The university will work "very closely" with the Saskatoon Health Region to determine if any closures should take place. If public schools close, it's likely the university would also close, Hannah said.</p>
<p>"It'll depend on how bad it gets and how fast it occurs."</p>
<p>Saskatchewan does not have any confirmed cases of swine flu, but the virus is likely here or will arrive soon, says the province's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"Over the next few months we're going to have to live with dealing with this virus," said Dr. Moira McKinnon.</p>

</p>
<p>The federal government will launch a public awareness campaign today to inform Canadians about the swine flu as the number of cases in Canada climbed to 34 and the number of worldwide cases surpassed 270.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 15 new cases of the influenza virus were confirmed in Canada -- four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario, five in British Columbia and, for the first time, one case in Quebec.</p>
<p>All of the cases are considered mild.</p>
<p>One of the B.C. cases involves an elementary school student in Vernon whose infection has prompted Beairsto Elementary School to close down for the next week. It is the first school closure in Canada due to the illness that is now responsible for killing a dozen people in Mexico and one person in the United States.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said the new domestic numbers, an increase from 19 confirmed cases on Wednesday, do not affect the federal government's approach to dealing with the spread of swine flu across the country. Ottawa is sticking to its plan of surveillance, vaccine development, ensuring antiviral supplies are adequate and providing Canadians with information.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper said there is reason for concern about what he called "the Mexican flu." But he said Canadians can be assured governments around the world are responding in an "appropriate and co-ordinated way."</p>
<p>"I believe we are doing what is necessary at the moment," Harper told reporters. "We obviously recommend to the population to follow any warnings or any advisories that are being given by various health authorities, whether they be federal, provincial or international," he said.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, also sought to assure Canadians that should the spread of swine flu be declared a pandemic, Canada is among the most prepared countries in the world.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is one step away from calling the flu outbreaks, now confirmed in at least 11 countries and suspected to be in many more, a pandemic.</p>
<p>It raised its alert level on Wednesday to Phase 5 on a six-phase scale. The change was meant as a signal that a pandemic is likely imminent and countries should activate their pandemic preparedness plans.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the increased alert level does not necessarily mean an increased risk to Canadians of contracting the illness.</p>
<p>"Still, there are concrete actions we are taking to ramp up our response and to prepare for the next phase," he said.</p>
<p>Canadians will start seeing notices from the Public Health Agency of Canada in their newspapers as part of the awareness campaign, advising readers on how to avoid infection. As the number of cases increase so will the intensity of the campaign.</p>
<p>The public health department also announced it will refer to the current swine flu as the "H1N1 flu virus" to make it clear that the virus is not being spread by pigs, but by humans.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said they were not surprised by the new cases announced Thursday and have been warning all week that the total number of cases will continue to rise.</p>
<p>The new cases in Alberta are among three men and a woman from Calgary, all recently returned from Mexico, which is believed to be where the virus originated. The four new cases in Nova Scotia are related to the first four cases announced Sunday, all among students at King's-Edgehill School in Windsor. That school, however, did not shut down, but the sick students were isolated.</p>
<p>The Ontario case involves a Toronto person, again reported as mild, and Quebec's case involved a Montreal-area man.</p>
<p>With British Columbia's five new cases reported Thursday, that province now has a total of 11.</p>
<p>The worldwide total of cases also rose sharply on Thursday as test results poured in from laboratories testing for the influenza H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Mexico saw its toll jump to 260, and test results from that country will likely start coming in faster now that it has its own laboratory capacity. It was previously sending samples to Canada and the United States for testing but experts from both countries have been on the ground in Mexico helping health officials there set up its own infrastructure.</p>
<p>The United States, now up to at least 109 cases, said WHO's move to Phase 5 "is a good thing."</p>
<p>"It's really a wake-up call to the rest of the global community that if you haven't been paying attention to what's going on here and in Mexico, it's time to pull out your pandemic plans and think about what you would do if this infection were occurring in your own borders," Richard Besser, acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a daily briefing.</p>
<p>American health officials had to do some damage control Thursday after Vice-President Joe Biden appeared to warn the public against travelling on planes and subways to prevent the spread of the illness.</p>
<p>"I think flying is safe. Going on the subway is safe. People should go out and live their lives," said Besser.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, tour companies have cancelled trips, several countries have issued travel advisories warning against non-essential travel to Mexico and on Thursday leaders from the European Union debated, but ultimately rejected, a ban on flights to the popular tourist destination.</p>
<p>A number of governments have been pitching in to help Mexico deal with the outbreak, which has forced the closure of schools, businesses and other public places and hit its tourism sector hard. On Thursday, a plane carrying masks, gloves, thermometers and other supplies left Beijing as part of China's emergency aid package for Mexico.</p>
<p>Despite the further spread of the virus on Thursday, a WHO official said the alert level will stay one level below six, the pandemic phase, until further notice.</p>
<p>"Today that assessment holds steady and we do not have any evidence that we should move to Phase 6 today or any such move is imminent right now," said WHO acting assistant director general Keiji Fukuda.</p>
<p>WHO also announced it has begun distributing some drugs from its stockpiles to developing countries.</p>
<p>There are still many unanswered questions about the new virus strain, but health officials continue to remind the public that the seasonal flu is also responsible for making thousands of people sick and for killing an average of 4,000 Canadians every year.</p>
<p>Normally, fewer than 0.1 per cent of people with influenza die, if they have no underlying medical conditions.</p>

<p>The NHL has its eye on the worsening swine flu outbreak, but won't comment any further about the possible effects it could have on playoff games.</p>
<p>In Mexico, where the flu is suspected in the deaths of 160 people, spectators have been banned from attending matches in all soccer leagues. Mexican soccer officials estimate the lost revenue at $2 million US this weekend.</p>
<p>"We're monitoring the situation closely, but there's really nothing more to say at this point," said NHL spokesman Gary Meagher.</p>
<p>Canada had reported 34 cases of the swine flu as of Thursday afternoon, while hundreds of schools in the U.S. have been shuttered to combat the spread of the flu, which the World Health Organization calls H1N1 influenza A. Worldwide, hundreds of people have been confirmed as having the flu.</p>

<p>Top-versus-bottom takes centre stage in the Premiership again this weekend, as the league's two leaders battle sides facing relegation.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Middlesbrough hosts leaders Manchester United, while Newcastle visits Liverpool on Sunday.</p>
<p>Odds are that the rich will only get richer in these two games, especially with Newcastle and Middlesbrough in such miserable form. If an upset is to happen, then United are the likely victims, as Middlesbrough have home advantage and have a habit of poaching results against big clubs.</p>
<p>Meanwhile at Newcastle, new manager Alan Shearer has had little impact, and hope there is fading. The club recently unveiled photos of the next season's new home uniforms, and fans couldn't help notice that the shirts were missing the familiar Premier League patches.</p>
<p>EL CLASICO</p>
<p>The biggest game of the Spanish season is Saturday, as Real Madrid host Barcelona, and with only four points now separating the two, the title is still very much undecided.</p>
<p>It certainly didn't seem that way four months ago, when Barcelona defeated Madrid at the Nou Camp in the first game in charge for new Real coach Juande Ramos. Madrid were in a tailspin and well out of the title race. Since then, though, Real have 17 wins and one draw in 18 games, as they have sensationally and doggedly battled their way to one gutsy victory after another. Gradually, Madrid has narrowed the gap, despite the best efforts of an extremely talented Barcelona side that looks completely unstoppable most nights, but have had just enough poor results to let Real back in the race.</p>
<p>The last time these teams clashed at the Bernabeu was the end of last season. Real were the newly crowned champions and went on to thrash their rivals 4-1. Revenge will very much be on the mind of Barcelona in this classic rematch.</p>
<p>SEMI-FINALLY</p>
<p>The Champions League semifinals conclude next week with Arsenal hosting Manchester United, trailing 1-0, while Chelsea host Barcelona on Wednesday with their series all square.</p>
<p>Although Chelsea got the job done in the first leg, holding high-flying Barcelona scoreless at the Nou Camp, a lot of questions have been raised over the way they went about it. Many feel that Chelsea's negative defensive tactics were unbecoming a side of its pedigree, and that one one should expect more from a club which has had so much money poured into it.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what tactics Guus Hiddink employs at home. He clearly has a lot of respect for Barcelona's potent midfield and high-scoring trio of strikers, but I hope there will be more to his game plan than frustrating the visitors and holding out for penalties.</p>
<p>As for Arsenal, I'm not sure they have what it takes to come back against United. They definitely miss the creative spark of Andrei Arshavin, who has made a big impact since joining the club, but is cup-tied for these games.</p>
<p>ROTTEN SWINE</p>
<p>The swine flu is dominating headlines off the pitch, and having its impact on the pitch as well -- at least in Mexico -- which has borne the brunt of this deadly</p>
<p>disease. Mexican top-flight games are now being played behind closed doors to help prevent the spread of infection, while the deciding match of the CONCACAF Champions League final between Cruz Azul and Atlante has been postponed until May 12. As well, the semifinals and finals of the CONCACAF U-17 Championships in Tijuana have been cancelled outright.</p>
<p>In London, meanwhile, Mexican striker Carlos Vela was ordered to stay away from Arsenal's training while doctor's tested him for swine flu. There was concern he could have caught the disease from friends visiting from Mexico, but the test came up clean.</p>

<p>I have a very easy answer to the marijuana boondoggle. Just approve medical marijuana to treat depression. Every Canadian will qualify! I mean, really, there is swine flu, the economic meltdown, job losses, the lack of reform to the Employment Insurance program, the Taliban in Pakistan potentially obtaining nuclear weapons, politicians who cannot focus on actually serving their electorate -- who in their right mind is not depressed?</p>
<p>Once approved to treat depression, we can all grow a plant or two in the backyard. Problem solved.</p>

<p>The federal government will launch a public awareness campaign today to inform Canadians about the swine flu as the number of cases in Canada climbed to 34 and the number of worldwide cases surpassed 270.</p>
<p>Yesterday, 15 new cases of the influenza virus were confirmed in Canada -- four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario, five in British Columbia and for the first time, one case in Quebec. All of the cases are mild.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said the new domestic numbers, an increase from 19 confirmed cases on Wednesday, do not affect the government's approach to dealing with the spread of flu across the country and that it is sticking to its plan of surveillance, vaccine development, ensuring antiviral supplies are adequate and that Canadians have the information they need.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper said there is reason for concern about what he called "the Mexican flu" but that Canadians can be assured that governments around the world are responding in an "appropriate and co-ordinated way."</p>
<p>"I believe we are doing what is necessary at the moment," Harper told reporters.</p>

<p>Officials in Vernon closed an elementary school yesterday after a student contracted swine flu, but provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall said it was just a precaution.</p>
<p>The number of diagnosed cases in B.C. has reached 11 -- the one in Vernon, eight in the Lower Mainland, one in Victoria and one in Prince George.</p>
<p>"The [Vernon] district has made the decision to close that school for one week, out of an abundance of caution and precaution," Kendall said yesterday at a news conference in Victoria. He said the child involved had been on a trip to Mexico, came down with a mild case of influenza and is recovering at home.</p>
<p>A Seattle school has also closed for a week after a student came down with what is believed to be swine flu.</p>
<p>Kendall said one of his main goals in addressing the media was to encourage parents and schools to continue taking steps to control the spread of the swine flu "but not to be too alarmed about what we're seeing in the spread of this illness.</p>
<p>"Cases in British Columbia are pretty similar to a seasonal influenza of moderate severity, so we're not seeing anything outrageous or really bad."</p>
<p>He said normal precautions for controlling the spread of the flu include frequent handwashing, covering your mouth with a tissue or your elbow when you cough and staying home if you start experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Kendall was joined by Greater Victoria school district superintendent John Gaiptman, who said his district has taken steps in response to the outbreak.</p>
<p>"We have our daytime custodians really concentrating on things like doorknobs, on faucets and taps, making sure that germs aren't being spread," Gaiptman said.</p>
<p>"We've put on a couple of extra custodians to help out in our larger schools and busier areas."</p>
<p>Kendall said that getting the facts to people is an essential part of dealing with the swine flu. He said he has heard of children being "shunned" by their peers if they have recently been to Mexico, where the start of the swine flu has been traced. "I think that's woefully unnecessary."</p>
<p>Gaiptman said the school district, the capital region's largest with 43 schools and close to 20,000 students, hasn't decided whether it might close schools.</p>
<p>"The answer is we don't make that decision in an isolated way. We're part of a team -- we'd be in touch with the chief medical officer. We'd be in touch with the [health] ministry. We would then make what we thought was the best decision at the time."</p>

<p>Lori Lueck is looking forward to lying on a sandy beach in Jamaica away from the daily media barrage of stories about the global outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>The Moose Jaw woman was suppose to leave today for Cancun but her flight was cancelled by <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, which suspended all its charter flights to Mexico -- the epicentre of the influenza outbreak -- until June 1.</p>
<p>Lueck, who is now booked to an alternate destination leaving May 8, said she weighed the risks of travelling and is taking a cautious common-sense approach.</p>
<p>"That is the thing. (The swine flu outbreak) is worldwide. You don't know who has it or where they have been because there are a lot of people who have bronchitis right now. So if anybody coughs, people are in such panic mode that it is like, 'Oh, God, don't cough on me.'</p>
<p>"It is going to be a concern no matter what. Sitting on a plane, you are at a higher risk because of the air and you are in a confined space and you have no control over who is sitting beside you.''</p>
<p>While she has hand sanitizing gel, Lueck said she will likely pack a supply of surgical face masks, although she is hoping the airline will take the necessary precautions.</p>
<p>"Will I wear a mask? I'm not sure, maybe I will,'' Lueck said.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan chief medical health officer Dr. Moira McKinnon, who told reporters Thursday that the swine flu virus is here to stay, urged people to play an active role in preventing the spread of the virus by taking the necessary precautions.</p>
<p>"We are asking people who get symptoms of flu, if it is mild, to self-isolate and manage it at home,'' McKinnon said, adding if the symptoms worsen within the first 24 to 48 hours, they should contact their doctor or the HealthLine.</p>
<p>While some drug stores have experienced an increased demand for surgical masks and hand sanitizing gel, McKinnon said there is no evidence to say wearing a mask out on the street is of much benefit to people who are not ill.</p>
<p>"We are advising (the use of) surgical masks for people who are coughing. It is important that people, who are symptomatic and are coughing, wear a mask (to prevent the spread of droplets),'' she said.</p>
<p>She also recommends regular handwashing and practising good cough etiquette.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Studios delay film releases in Mexico</b>
</div><div>Claudia Eller and Reed Johnson   </div>
<div>Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>616 words</div><div>1 May 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>The Hollywood movie studios, about to enter the most crucial time of the year for ticket sales, are being forced to delay the Mexico releases of their big early-summer movies, including Star Trek, X-Men Origins: Wolverine and Angels & Demons as theatres there close because of the swine flu epidemic sweeping the country.</p>
<p>Such a delay could cost the studios tens of millions in revenue at a time when they are increasingly relying on international box office to offset production and marketing expenses. Mexico ranks in the top 10 movie markets, accounting for about six per cent of foreign ticket sales. It could also undercut the performance of movies when they eventually open in theatres by giving pirated DVD copies a chance to flood the market.</p>
<p>Despite widespread piracy -- bootleg titles are sold openly on the streets for about $2 apiece -- Mexicans are heavy consumers of U.S. films that receive wide distribution in Mexico's roughly 4,000 movie theatres, particularly in large national chains such as Cinemex.</p>
<p>"Mexico is a big market, especially when we're coming into this time of year," said Jack Ledwith, senior vice president of international distribution for Universal Pictures, which will delay the May 29 release of State of Play to June 12. "This is definitely having a big impact on movie-going in Mexico, and I don't think we know yet what the ramifications it will have for Hollywood."</p>
<p>Ledwith said one of the big problems with the studio's pushing back releases is that it causes "a domino effect," forcing studios to scramble for new release dates that have already been set aside for other movies. "It's a big struggle where to put all these films."</p>
<p>The summer movie-going season, which kicks off this weekend with Wolverine, is crucial for the studios because it can account for 40 per cent or more of annual box office revenue.</p>
<p>Studio executives with movies set to open in May said they had all delayed their releases and were closely following the situation in Mexico. Though the Mexican government says it plans to reopen theatres May 6, it will depend on how long it takes to contain the epidemic. So far, the flu has been cited as the "probable" cause of death for 159 Mexicans.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Twentieth Century Fox</span> cancelled its April 29 premiere of Wolverine and plans to push back the film's release to May 14 -- though that date remains fluid. Fox also has the sequel Night at the Museum 2 set to open May 22.</p>
<p>"We're in a wait-and-see position, and we're most concerned about the containment of the flu," said Hilary Clark, head of international publicity for Fox. Clark said that on Monday, Fox sent home all of its international staff in Mexico City and shut the office.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Paramount Pictures</span> delayed the May 8 opening of Star Trek and according to a studio spokesperson has not yet determined an alternative date.</p>
<p>On May 15, <span class="companylink">Sony</span> Pictures had planned to release its The Da Vinci Code followup Angels & Demons in about 700 theatres and Terminator Salvation on June 4.</p>
<p>"We're looking at both films and re-evaluating," said Jeff Blake, <span class="companylink">Sony</span>'s head of worldwide marketing and distribution.</p>
<p>Warner Bros. has pushed Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, which was to debut on about 250 screens, from May 8 to June 12.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a very fluid situation, and dates could change based on current events as well as how competitive dates line up," said Veronika Kwan-Rubinek, Warner's international distribution president.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Many unknowns in pandemic plan</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>

</p>
<p>Pierre Trudeau invoked the War Measures Act in 1970 to battle radical Quebec separatists. Would Prime Minister Stephen Harper invoke its successor to combat the flu?</p>
<p>Since the 2003 SARS outbreak, which killed 44 Canadians and cost the economy an estimated $1.5 billion, public-health officials have been refining a national plan to protect Canadians against a flu pandemic. The result is a 550-page document that lays out the roles and responsibilities of federal, provincial and municipal governments and their health-care authorities.</p>
<p>But like any plan, the pandemic blueprint is only an outline.</p>
<p>Depending on a range of factors, including the nature and severity of the flu strain sweeping the globe, Canada's public-health officials and political leaders will have to make a number of tough decisions that would not only put their careers on the line, but also the lives of Canadians.</p>
<p>"We have a comprehensive plan, and it's extremely detailed, and we're much better off for having a plan in place. But these things never go smoothly," said Dr. Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research Chair in health policy at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>Although the SARS outbreak intensified the planning efforts, the federal government has been preparing for a pandemic since 1983.</p>
<p>A first draft was created in 1988, and federal officials update the plan every few years.</p>
<p>Canada has revised its pandemic alert system to closely mirror that of the World Health Organization, which ranks outbreaks on a scale of one to six. But even if WHO raises its alert to six, signifying a full-blown global pandemic, it's not clear all jurisdictions in Canada will operate in "pandemic" mode.</p>
<p>Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, for example, will watch closely to see if the City of Toronto officially declares that the city has entered a pandemic phase, said Dr. Allison McGeer, the hospital's director of infection control.</p>
<p>"If this turns into a pandemic, the waves are going to be in different places at different times," said McGeer. "Across the full geography of Canada, there may be as much as six or eight weeks' difference between the peaks."</p>
<p>If Canada declares it has entered a pandemic phase, there are certain things to expect.</p>
<p>Canadian researchers are already involved in the global effort to develop a swine-flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Having declared a national pandemic, the government will have to decide whether to implement a mass vaccination program. They would also have to decide who gets the vaccine first, a decision officials are likely already weighing by reviewing the plan's list of "priority" groups, such as front-line doctors and nurses, and individuals most at risk of falling ill.</p>
<p>While the race to produce a vaccine continued, the provinces and territories would likely begin distributing Canada's stockpile of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada, the lead federal agency in a pandemic, would start calling up extra health-care workers and volunteers from organizations such as the Red Cross. Given that officials estimate between 10,000 and 58,000 deaths in a "mild" pandemic, provinces and municipalities would be tasked with ensuring morgues and cemeteries have enough capacity.</p>
<p>If the situation becomes dire, it's possible the prime minister or Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will recommend Canadians stay home, as President Felipe Calderon asked Mexicans to do Thursday.</p>
<p>The federal government could also make recommendations to cancel public gatherings such as concerts and parades, or to close schools. Provincial authorities and local school boards would likely make the final call on closing day cares, as well as elementary and secondary schools.</p>
<p>Despite all this planning, some monumental decisions will have to be made in the heat of the moment.</p>
<p>For example, the pandemic plan raises the possibility Ottawa might declare a Public Welfare Emergency under the Emergencies Act, which was enacted in 1988 but has never been invoked.</p>
<p>Like the War Measures Act it replaced, the Emergencies Act gives the federal government extraordinary powers to protect Canadians in a national crisis, such as a natural disaster, war or disease outbreak.</p>
<p>Once a Public Welfare Emergency is declared, Ottawa could ban individuals from travelling to or from a specific area, establish emergency shelters and hospitals, and direct people to provide "essential services."</p>
<p>In other words, the federal government would effectively be able to assume control of emergency health-care services, usually a provincial responsibility.</p>
<p>As draconian as such measures sound, they are not out of the realm of possibility, said Wilson, of the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>Under an agreement signed after the SARS outbreak, Ontario has agreed to share case data with Ottawa, but no other province is under such obligation, he noted.</p>
<p>Without data flowing in from the provinces, the federal government's response would be all but paralyzed.</p>
<p>"There's nothing between voluntary co-operation (of the provinces) and declaration of a Public Welfare Emergency. There's no intermediate ground," said Wilson.</p>

<p>Even without any confirmed cases of swine flu in Saskatchewan, the virus is likely here or will arrive soon, says the province's chief medical health officer.</p>
<p>"Over the next few months we're going to have to live with dealing with this virus," said Dr. Moira McKinnon.</p>
<p>Because the swine flu -- which the World Health Organization is now calling influenza A H1N1 -- has so far been described as a "mild" illness outside of Mexico, some cases may be going undetected altogether as people recover as they would from a seasonal influenza, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>The WHO on Thursday upped its pandemic alert level to five, one notch short of the top of the scale, as the virus has been detected in several countries.</p>
<p>McKinnon said the focus is no longer on finding every case but rather on preventing serious illness and death.</p>
<p>"When an epidemic starts we like to find out where the cases are so we can slow down the spread from that case, so we can kind of contain it and possibly get rid of the virus if we isolate that person," she said.</p>
<p>"But once it starts occurring right around the world there's no way that we're going to contain the virus and we accept that we're never going to eradicate it from the population."</p>
<p>A new flu virus makes an impact because few people have immunity, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>"As the world develops immunity to it, it just becomes a regular seasonal flu," she said, noting the flu of 1918-19 has "slowly mutated" so that a descendant of it is still part of the seasonal influenza system that hits every winter.</p>
<p>McKinnon said that everyone who goes to the doctor and fits the definition of a potential swine flu case won't necessarily be tested for the virus or prescribed anti-virals. People with mild symptoms should stay at home and contact a doctor or the provincial HealthLine (1-877-800-0002) if their condition worsens, she added.</p>
<p>"Already the health-care system is starting to get overloaded and we want the health system to have the capacity to deal with people who are seriously ill," she said.</p>
<p>McKinnon said information from Mexico suggests that if a case is serious, it's apparent nearly right away.</p>
<p>"So far, almost every case in the U.S. except one was mild so we're banking on that most people will only have a mild illness at this stage, but we're watching it closely," said McKinnon.</p>
<p>The province will stop its daily media briefings on swine flu, but will update the public on any positive cases that are confirmed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, an emergency operations centre established by the Ministry of Health continues to operate for up to 14 hours a day at the T.C. Douglas building, with someone remaining on call through the night.</p>
<p>What is usually a staff training area has been transformed into an information hub equipped with computers, fax machines, BlackBerrys and wireless communication system. The area, which has been set up to manage other critical incidents in the past, can run on emergency generator power.</p>
<p>In the main room, a count of how many H1N1 cases have been detected worldwide is written on a whiteboard, while another board details the team's to-do list. Members ready the province's anti-viral supply, monitor the latest developments and participate in regular provincial and Canada-wide conference calls with other health officials.</p>
<p>"We've broken into a number of specialist expert groups working on particular issues," said Garnet Matchett, the director of operations for the ministry's health emergency management branch.</p>
<p>"Those groups will get together at the end of the day and share the information back and forth and an action plan will be put together for the tasks that need to be put together in the next business cycle," said Matchett as he toured media through the centre Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Health Minister Don McMorris acknowledged the swine flu situation has been getting a lot of attention but said he thinks it is appropriate, and praised staff working at the centre.</p>
<p>"I'll be criticized because we're over-prepared. That's fine," said McMorris. "But I don't want to be criticized because we were under-prepared."</p>

<p>The number of confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada soared Thursday, with another 13 cases reported -- four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, three in British Columbia and one each in Ontario and Quebec.</p>
<p>The national number now stands at 32.</p>
<p>The cases in Alberta -- three men and a woman from Calgary, all of whom recently returned from Mexico -- were described as mild and all are recovering.</p>
<p>Four new cases in Windsor, N.S., bring the total there to eight. All of the cases are related to four sick students at King's-Edgehill School and are described as mild. Health officials there are warning more people will likely contract the illness.</p>
<p>The Ontario case involved a Toronto person, again reported as mild. No details were available on the three new cases in British Columbia, nor from the first case reported in Quebec.</p>
<p>Governments around the world are mobilizing their plans for a widespread outbreak of swine flu, after the World Health Organization raised its alert level a day earlier to phase five to signal that a pandemic of swine flu is close to reality.</p>
<p>During a press briefing from Geneva, a WHO official said the alert level will stay one below six, the pandemic phase, until further notice.</p>
<p>"Today that assessment holds steady and we do not have any evidence that we should move to phase six today or any such move is imminent right now," said WHO acting assistant director general Keiji Fukuda.</p>
<p>He reported a jump in the number of confirmed cases in Mexico, where the outbreak of the new H1N1 strain is centred, to 97. The number will likely continue to increase at a quicker pace now that Mexico has its own testing capacity to verify cases. Health experts from several countries, including Canada, have been in Mexico to help authorities there get a laboratory up and running. Samples from Mexico are also being tested at Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Mexico.</p>
<p>The United States updated its number of cases Thursday to 109 and more cases in other countries were also confirmed by laboratory testing.</p>
<p>The swine flu virus has now been confirmed in 13 countries and infected a total of 265 people, according to WHO.</p>

<p>In Mexico, the swine flu is thought to have infected at least 1,600 people (and probably thousands more) and killed at least 152. In the U.S., the swine flu has infected at least 68 people. And the number is growing fast -- and spreading from border states like Texas and California to places like Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, British Columbia, Nova Scotia and Ontario. Is it time to panic? In a word, no. But it is time to prepare.</p>
<p>This epidemic is caused by a novel strain of Influenza A/H1N1 virus. Predicting the progress of flu pandemics is fraught with problems, given the ease with which influenza spreads and its inherent biological unpredictability. It is too early to tell if the swine flu outbreak that began in central Mexico and has spread to more than 10 countries across the globe will reach the severity of the deadly 1918-19 pandemic that killed approximately 55,000 in Canada, 675,000 in the U.S., and 50 million worldwide.</p>
<p>Like then, we potentially are confronting a virus which appears to sicken and sometimes kill not only the very old and the very young, but those in the prime of their lives. However, due to developments in science and public health, we are in a much better position to weather this crisis. Scientists already have identified the strain of this new A/H1N1 virus, epidemiological surveillance is moving at a nearly instantaneous pace, and there exists at least a limited stockpile of anti-virals that can help treat those infected. Seed virus already has been collected to manufacture a swine flu vaccine in the months to come.</p>
<p>It is imperative that authorities -- at the local, state, national and international levels -- monitor the situation, communicate well, and ensure that they are ready to intervene immediately if evidence of a deadly pandemic emerges.</p>
<p>For example, officials at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have been in constant contact with Mexican health authorities, Health Canada, the health agencies of other affected nations, the World Health Organization, and local authorities in communities affected by the flu.</p>
<p>No matter what any expert tells you, it is unclear how this global health event will unfold in the weeks and months to come. But even if this is not the hurricane Katrina of flu crises, it would be foolish not to use this situation to enhance pandemic preparedness. In reality, the alternative to over-reacting is under-reacting. And that is a prescription for disaster.</p>
<p>On April 28, Premier Dalton McGuinty declared that Ontario was well prepared to handle a swine flu outbreak having "learned the painful lessons of SARS six years ago." In case you forgot, it was then that Toronto became our hemisphere's epicentre for an outbreak which took the lives of 44 Canadians, infected over 400, and involved the home quarantine of thousands more.</p>
<p>In the years since, Ontario and Toronto have worked to develop pandemic preparedness plans and applied many lessons from that episode. The real test of the protocols they have developed will depend largely on the spread and progress of swine flu.</p>
<p>But even with the most sophisticated planning, hitting the sweet spot in epidemic control -- one that protects the most people from disease and minimizes disruptions to society -- is even tougher than hitting a fast ball thrown by a major league pitcher.</p>
<p>The greatest tension that erupted during the SARS epidemic in Toronto related to pushback against recommended home quarantines for the sick and the heavy responsibility placed on front-line health care professionals. Nearly nine decades earlier, during the 1918-19 influenza pandemic, North American communities faced similar tensions when it came to restrictions on individual liberties during an extended health emergency.</p>
<p>Confronting escalating cases and deaths in the fall of 1918, communities had to decide whether and when the public health measures today we term non-pharmaceutical interventions -- such as quarantine and public gathering bans -- should be voluntary or mandatory and, if decreed by law, how they could be enforced fairly and effectively.</p>
<p>Communities navigated these tricky decisions as they determined when and if to shutter schools, theatres and businesses without inciting panic, and how to encourage volunteers to nurse the ill.</p>
<p>The historical record and recent studies of pandemic awareness suggest that the majority of people will acquiesce to, if not embrace, voluntary NPI. Compliance with home quarantine was very high during the 2003 SARS epidemic in Toronto. Furthermore, a 2006 health survey conducted by Harvard University indicates that most Americans voluntarily would sequester themselves at home during a severe pandemic for at least one month.</p>
<p>Today, one is impressed by the willingness of most Mexico City citizens to wear the face masks that the police have been distributing.</p>
<p>It is heartening that many people, due to a combination of self interest and civic duty, are willing to comply with voluntary NPI, at least for certain periods of time. Such goodwill, however, can evaporate quickly when government officials institute mandatory NPI, particularly if such orders are not communicated well.</p>
<p>In the end, the effective management of the swine flu of 2009 will require a solid foundation of public health science that is acted upon with high degrees of inter-agency co-ordination, transparent communication and civic co-operation.</p>

<p>With heightened concern about the swine flu, Leamington District Memorial Hospital has announced new procedures for visitors and patients.</p>
<p>Visitors and patients will be asked to clean their hands with sanitizing gel immediately upon entering the building.</p>
<p>They will also be asked two screening questions: Do you have a new or worsening cough or shortness of breath? Are you feeling feverish?</p>
<p>If the answer is yes to both, visitors and patients will be asked to wear a mask and will be referred to their health care provider or to the emergency department for followup. Patients will also be asked about recent travel or contact with individuals who have travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>"As always, we ask anyone who is not feeling well to not visit the hospital, and to re-schedule their appointment or procedure," said hospital official Sarah Padfield.</p>

<p>With two nasal swabs down and a dozen to go, this region has yet to register a positive test for swine flu.</p>
<p>But the area's medical officer of health said Thursday the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is ramping up its response to the pending pandemic as the number of national cases rose to 32.</p>
<p>Dr. Allen Heimann said local labs continue to closely monitor the situation, the unit will update the public on test results regularly and more stringent screening will be carried out at area hospitals.</p>
<p>The move comes after the World Health Organization moved its pandemic alert level from four to five on a scale of six.</p>
<p>"Locally, we've had two nasal swabs come back negative," said Heimann. "We have 12 more test results to follow. Right now there are eight cases in Ontario, all associated with travel to Mexico."</p>
<p>While acknowledging the "rising concern" in the community, Heimann said the local response remains one of vigilance.</p>
<p>He said preventive measures are the best course of action at this point, noting all cases reported in Canada have been mild.</p>
<p>Heimann urged people to wash their hands often, cover their nose and mouth if coughing and, if any symptoms appear, to stay home from work or school.</p>
<p>He added those experiencing fever or respiratory problems, including a serious cough, should go to a clinic or hospital, if possible wearing a surgical mask, where emergency room staff are monitoring all arrivals who have symptoms. He said seeking treatment is more urgent if the person, or a relative, has been in Mexico in the past week.</p>
<p>Heimann said that so far none of the Ontario cases has required hospitalization or even the prescription of anti-viral agents.</p>
<p>He added the death rate for severe, non-seasonal influenza has been between one and two per cent, going back to the Hong Kong Flu of 1968 and the Asian Flu in the 1950s. Heimann noted the death rate for a typical, seasonal flu outbreak is 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p>Because the virus is new, he said, there is no vaccine available and no known natural bodily defences.</p>
<p>"The flu can have serious consequences, but by no means does it always have serious consequences."</p>
<p>He said people should also not panic over the increasing use of the word pandemic.</p>
<p>"Really that's a technical definition," he said. "It really confirms what's going on in the world, a wider and wider distribution to more and more countries. It does not mean it's getting more virulent or easier to transmit."</p>
<p>He described the flu's advance throughout the world as "fast," but not surprising. He said the health unit has contingency plans that will see a graded response depending on how the situation unfolds. All local hospitals have isolation facilities available. Whether it will become necessary to order schools closed if a student tests positive, as has been done in Britain and the U.S., may be considered, depending on the severity of any outbreak.</p>

<p>Re: Swine Flu Not So Scary, editorial, April 30.</p>
<p>Media pronouncements about swine flu are often made by pseudo-scientists and politicians. These individuals "may" be attempting to define a pandemic, even psychologically promote one. I recall public health lectures at medical school and the admonition not to get "endemic," "epidemic" and "pandemic" confused, as pandemics are very rare.</p>
<p>Possibly the pseudo-scientists and politicians are creating a parallel social disease, i. e., panic. It is essential to be well-informed but the "hennypenny" syndrome that the sky is falling belongs to the Dark Ages before the enlightenment.</p>

<p>Swine flu has now infected 257 people worldwide. The World Health Organization has confirmed eight deaths although many more people are suspected to have died from the virus. The number of confirmed cases in Mexico, where the outbreak of the new H1N1 strain is centred, rose to 97. Mexico also has 176 deaths that may be linked to the virus. The number of cases in Mexico will likely continue to increase at a quicker pace now that the country has its own testing capacity to verify cases. The United States updated its number of cases yesterday to 109.</p>

<p>The swine flu epidemic is not expected have a significant impact on the earnings of <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. (WJA/TSX). But the spread of the virus does threaten to further undermine demand for air travel in the current economic downturn and may delay an expected recovery in the second half of the year, according to Fadi Chamoun, <span class="companylink">UBS</span> analyst.</p>
<p>WestJet, along with several other tour operators and airlines, pulled its flights to Mexico in a response to the outbreak there. The Calgary carrier, which will report its first quarter earnings on May 5, cancelled all of its flights to the country until June 20.</p>
<p>"Given that [West-Jet's] peak flight season tends to be between NovApr, we believe the cancellations will have little impact to [WestJet's] operations," Mr. Chamoun said. "However, to the extent that the outbreak exacerbates the already very weak demand for air travel and undermines a potential [second half of 2009] recovery in demand."</p>
<p>Mr. Chamoun said WestJet's earnings may remain under pressure until the end of the third quarter.</p>
<p>"Over the long term, we believe ultimately swine flu is a transient issue and represents a good buying opportunity pending containment of the outbreak," he said.</p>
<p>"We maintain our long-term constructive view on WJA based on its attractive valuation versus global peers, competitive business model, strong growth profile and robust ROI and free cash flow."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Outbreak questions unanswered; Scientists watching like hawks; It is dissipating or are we on the brink of a full-blown killer pandemic?</b>
</div><div>ANDREW MAYEDA   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>585 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>As they continue to analyze the new swine-flu virus, researchers are grappling with a puzzling question: Why are the Canadian and the U.S. cases milder than those in Mexico?</p>
<p>It's not just an interesting question for scientists to ponder. Over the coming days and weeks, public-health officials will be watching like hawks to see if the milder cases are a sign the outbreak is dissipating, or whether such cases are just the prelude to a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>Infectious-disease experts note the Spanish flu pandemic started out mildly in the spring of 1918 before re-emerging with a vengeance in the fall.</p>
<p>"We cannot be complacent, because this particular influenza strain, just like any other virus or flu strain, can still continue to mutate and it can mutate in either direction," said Dr. Colin Lee, associate medical officer of health at the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit.</p>
<p>There have been more than 150 suspected deaths in Mexico, and yesterday, the United States announced a toddler from Mexico City had died after catching the swine flu.</p>
<p>To date, most of the cases in countries other than Mexico have been relatively mild. Several theories are emerging to explain the discrepancy.</p>
<p>One is purely statistical.</p>
<p>In any flu outbreak, there will be a large number of mild cases and a much smaller number of severe, or even fatal, cases. Given that Mexico is the epicentre of the outbreak, it makes some sense more deaths would have been confirmed there so far, noted Dr. Gerald Evans, chief of the infectious-diseases division at Queen's University.</p>
<p>Experts also say the virus could have mutated, becoming milder as it migrates to other parts of the world.</p>
<p>It's also possible the strain found in places such as Canada and the United States is at an earlier stage of mutation than the original strain in Mexico, which would suggest Canada and the U.S. are in store for much more serious cases.</p>
<p>"The question really is: Are we looking at the earlier stage of the disease, which means the strain we are seeing now (in Canada and the U.S.) is just an earlier version of the Mexican strain," said Bhagirath Singh, scientific director of the CIHR Institute of Infection and Immunity at the University of Western Ontario.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility something in the genetic makeup of Mexicans is making them more susceptible, although some experts dismiss the hypothesis.</p>
<p>"We do not differ genetically that much from our Mexican brothers and sisters as some people might speculate, and genes very rarely have anything to do with the expression of infectious diseases," Evans said.</p>
<p>Some point to poor health-care infrastructure in some parts of Mexico, which would make it more difficult for some Mexicans to receive care, or even air pollution.</p>
<p>"This is a respiratory disease, and in parts of Mexico, especially Mexico City, there's a lot of pollution, and it may exacerbate respiratory infections," Lee explained.</p>
<p>In any case, it will likely be weeks before health officials and researchers have a solid hypothesis.</p>
<p>"The Mexican data may not be very reliable because of their testing and health-care infrastructure, so they may not be seeing the milder cases," Lee said. "It's so early right now that nobody has really confirmed the data."</p>

<p>Concern over swine flu has put the kibosh on two local high schools' trips to New York City.</p>
<p>Nearly 50 students from Laurier Macdonald High School in St. Léonard had planned to tour Manhattan this weekend and visit the Statue of Liberty and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>John F. Kennedy High School in Villeray district has also cancelled a student trip to New York City next week because of health concerns.</p>
<p>Laurier Macdonald principal Eileen Kelly acknowledged her school is being very cautious by cancelling the trip, and that the risks would be slight - and possibly non-existent.</p>
<p>"We feel that the safety and health of our children come first," she said. "I'm erring on (the side) of extreme caution."</p>
<p>The students, most of whom are in Grade 11, are part of the school's Multicultural Society. They were supposed to leave tomorrow by bus and return Sunday.</p>
<p>The tour organizers are working so the students can get as much money back as possible, Kelly said.</p>
<p>"Our governing board is behind the decision," said Kelly, who added it was made in consultation with school board officials.</p>
<p>The English Montreal School Board issued an advisory to parents yesterday on the swine flu outbreak that noted no cases of the influenza strain have been reported in Quebec. The notice also included tips for families to protect themselves from the flu.</p>
<p>The Commission scolaire de Montréal sent out a similar letter, which said the board has been working for several months on a plan to deal with continuity of services in the event of a pandemic.</p>

<p>Canadian stocks rebounded after a twoday slide at the start of the week as positive earnings reports and rising commodity prices buoyed investor confidence.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX composite index climbed 68.28 points, or 0.73%, yesterday to close at 9416.31. Gainers outpaced losers almost three to one on Canada's main exchange, with six of 10 subindices closing in the positiveterritory.</p>
<p>The TSXventureexchangewas also higher, adding 20.87 points, or 2.10%, to 1013.97. The Canadian dollar, meanwhile, climbed to US83.13 cents, up 1.2 cents as the U.S. dollar fell sharplyonconcerns about rising long-terminterest rates in theU.S.</p>
<p>"In general, there was more encouraging news [yesterday] than discouraging news today," said David Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services in Toronto. In addition to a list of solid earnings on both sides of the border, he thinks people are less concerned about the repercussions of the swine flu on the overall economy, as reports surface downplaying its impact. He added the latest GDP figures, while worse than expected, were not all bad -- noting that consumer spending continues to remain strong. "I think there is a growing consensus that if we are not at the bottom of the economic cycle, we are very close to there because we are seeing a few indicators that are turning fromdown to flat." The falling greenback also gave a lift to commodity prices, helping resources stocks lead the way higher in Toronto.</p>
<p>The energy group jumped 1.66%, as light sweet crude oil jumped back above US$50 to US$50.97 a barrel, up US$1.05. <span class="companylink">Talisman Energy Inc</span>. climbed after reporting better-than-expected earnings. Materials added 1.40% as a group, as copper prices surged and gold prices advanced to US$900.50 an ounce, up US$6.90. <span class="companylink">Barrick Gold Corp</span>. jumped five cents to $35.65, after saying its first-quarter profit fell 28% on higher costs and weaker copper prices.</p>
<p>Other stocks making significant market moves on earnings releases included <span class="companylink">Rogers Communications Inc</span>. and MapleLeafFoodsInc . The wireless giant fell 1.18%after reporting profit fell 10% in the first quarter, while Maple Leaf climbed 1.78%, after reporting a return to profit for the first quarter, despite the lingering effects of last summer's tainted-meat recall.</p>
<p>In the U.S., stocks also rose. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 168.78 points, or 2.11%, to 8185.73. The S&P 500 advanced 18.48 points, or 2.16%, to 873.64 and the Nasdaq composite index gained 38.13 points, or 2.28%, to 1711.94.</p>

</p>
<p>The first U.S. economic report card of 2009 arrived yesterday, and it was even worse than expected. That could be good news.</p>
<p>Okay, it's not good news that the economy shrank even more than forecast. After all, it was down by a steep 6.1 per cent in the first three months of this year, bringing us the steepest six-month drop seen in the U.S. since 1958. But it is definitely good news that the pattern of losses points toward much better days from here on.</p>
<p>At IHS Global Insight in Boston, chief U.S. financial economist Brian Bethune looked through the report yesterday and saw some of those famous green sprouts of hope.</p>
<p>Yes, Bethune acknowledged, the first-quarter numbers were awful, but they were awful in a way that suggested some clearing of the decks for renewed production and some one-shot issues unlikely to continue hammering the numbers, he said yesterday.</p>
<p>Right now, in the second quarter, Bethune is betting that the slump has eased to only about half the rate of decline seen in yesterday's report.</p>
<p>By the third quarter, which begins in July, he predicts the beginning of modest growth again.</p>
<p>Bethune is not alone. Analysts from all over the U.S. and Canada saw the bad first-quarter economic slump as kind of a final blowoff of recessionary bad news. Not everyone believes growth will resume by this summer, but a survey of economists by the Bloomberg news service found that this was the median forecast.</p>
<p>Even the U.S. Federal Reserve joined the party, although in its usual restrained fashion. The Fed noted that distress in the economy and in credit markets seems to have eased, giving stock markets permission to rise for the day.</p>
<p>How can such optimism come from such a serious report of economic collapse?</p>
<p>Partly because amid all the dead leaves, there was one particularly important green shoot. Consumer spending, the all-important fuel for most U.S. economic growth, had collapsed late last year, but rebounded to grow at a rate of 2.2 per cent in the first quarter, much faster than anticipated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dead leaves were in areas we already knew were terrible, like home construction, or where we knew they had to be terrible temporarily in order to purge the excesses of last year, like inventory reduction.</p>
<p>Inventory reduction is just another way of saying that production has been brought to a screeching halt until the big pile of unsold stuff on the shelves gets smaller. It has been most noticeable in the auto industry recently, but it has hit all kinds of business.</p>
<p>The good news is that inventories have been slashed so brutally over the past two quarters that this won't keep subtracting from economic growth any more, Bethune believes.</p>
<p>Indeed, at some point pretty soon, the shelves will be bare enough that production will have to increase, boosting growth. Auto production should be one example. Sick as the industry is, the catastrophic sales levels early this year were below the bare minimum needed to replace the old clunkers that must be scrapped each year.</p>
<p>The really big negative surprise in the first-quarter downturn was the role of government, which actually subtracted from growth in spite of plans to spend like crazy. This is a one-shot deal, caused by a drop in defence spending, which is volatile, and timing. State and local governments, which mostly can't run deficits, cut their spending in the first quarter faster than the feds could ramp up theirs.</p>
<p>But by now, the huge U.S. federal stimulus program is groaning into motion, causing government to contribute to growth, not hold it back.</p>
<p>Unless the Swine Flu becomes a severe threat or the U.S. banking sector is sicker than markets now believe, we have a reasonable shot at seeing some economic growth soon.</p>

<p>Aislin's Tuesday cartoon, about tourists returning from Mexico, evoked some irate comments from readers. Here is the cartoonist's response:</p>
<p>I'm a little puzzled by readers' concern over Tuesday's cartoon.</p>
<p>We Canadians (myself included) travel a great deal to Mexico, often returning with souvenir T-shirts and silly sombreros we never wear again.</p>
<p>But now returning tourists (as pictured all week in the news) might be carrying a deadly virus, too. This is a serious, far-reaching problem. The cartoon says exactly that.</p>
<p>The imagery of the skull apparently bothered some readers. But the skull is a very common symbol in Mexican graphic art, and not considered to be anywhere near as threatening as it is in our culture.</p>
<p>It was a famous Mexican cartoonist named Posada who popularized the skull, in connection with the Day of the Dead, at the turn of the last century.</p>
<p>I personally know many contemporary Mexican cartoonists working in Mexico City who use the symbol frequently.</p>

<p>An entire Air France flight crew and several individual flight attendants have refused to board flights to Mexico since Saturday because of the outbreak of swine flu, airport sources said yesterday.</p>
<p>Under French law, employees may refuse to stay on their job if they have "a reasonable motive" to believe their health or life is seriously and imminently threatened.</p>
<p>A pilot who was to fly from Paris to Mexico on Saturday refused to do so for health reasons, citing the swine flu crisis. His refusal automatically involved the aircraft's crew, which was replaced, airport officials said.</p>
<p>Since Saturday, several flight attendants have said they will not fly to Mexico, citing "fatigue," the only reason accepted under French industrial law.</p>
<p>Air France would not comment when questioned by AFP.</p>

<p>An outreach program aimed at teaching Montreal-area children "how to beat the bugs" couldn't have come at a better time.</p>
<p>The health community is focused on swine flu as the World Health Organization yesterday updated its alert to Phase 5 - on a scale of 1 to 6 - meaning a pandemic is imminent, after the first death of H1N1 swine flu was confirmed outside Mexico.</p>
<p>Organized to coincide with the International Day of Immunology, the outreach program created by three Montreal universities has nothing to do with the current outbreak, said Marianna Newkirk, Immunology Montreal co-founder and associate dean of research at the McGill University faculty of medicine.</p>
<p>"It's unfortunate there is this illness that is spreading, but in terms of informing the community, it's very timely," Newkirk said.</p>
<p>Immunology is not taught in schools, yet nearly every child gets vaccinated, she noted.</p>
<p>Children are also considered prime spreaders of germs.</p>
<p>The first immunology outreach program began yesterday, targeting 1,500 students age 6 to 14.</p>
<p>University science students were to visit several elementary and high schools, starting with Lindsay Place High School in Pointe Claire.</p>
<p>Using a handshaking game to show how easily viruses and germs can travel in a population that is not vaccinated, they learn about the function and importance of vaccines, and are informed of such public health problems as HIV/AIDS, cancer and influenza.</p>
<p>The overall message was, "Vaccines not only keep you protected, they help keep everyone else healthy," said Karen Canales, of McGill University.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, concerns about swine flu topped the agenda in the class discussion.</p>
<p>But in science teacher Catherine Falmagne's Grade 10/11 class, students were already well informed. They knew a Nova Scotia school was hit by swine flu linked to travel in Mexico.</p>
<p>They also came up with the right answers when McGill science student Amar Bhindi asked them: "What makes the swine flu so scary?"</p>
<p>The responses came rapidly: It's a new virus, it can be passed from person to person, there is no vaccine, "and we can't protect ourselves."</p>
<p>One student wondered about the overuse of antibiotics.</p>
<p>After the class bell rang, Grade 11 student Katharyn Chaks said she enjoyed getting the facts and learning how a disease like swine flu attacks the immune system.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic threat increases; Swine Flu; WHO raises alert level; 19 cases now in Canada</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>607 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>As Canada's swine flu infection total reached 19 yesterday, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to its second highest phase and urged nations to "ramp up" their preparations for a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>By increasing the alert level to 5 from 4, the WHO is indicating a pandemic is probably imminent and countries should take certain actions with an increased sense of urgency to get ready for it.</p>
<p>"All countries should immediately activate their pandemic preparedness plans," WHO director-general Margaret Chan said at a news conference in Geneva.</p>
<p>According to WHO's guidelines, Phase 5 is reached when there is human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries.</p>
<p>On Monday, WHO raised the level from 3 to 4, which meant a pandemic was possible but not inevitable.</p>
<p>The global spread of the virus, which originated in Mexico and is suspected of making more than 2,000 people there sick, has moved quickly since then.</p>
<p>"This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal to governments ... to the pharmaceutical industry and the business community, that certain actions now should be undertaken with increased urgency and an accelerated pace," Chan said.</p>
<p>She made her decision after intensive consultations with experts studying the swine flu virus that has infected more than 140 people in at least seven countries.</p>
<p>Earlier yesterday, the illness claimed its first fatality outside Mexico, where the disease is believed to have killed more than 150 people.</p>
<p>The victim in the United States was a toddler, a Mexican citizen who was visiting Texas. The child died in hospital after quickly falling ill.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said the WHO's raising the alert doesn't fundamentally change the federal government's course of action in responding to the swine flu outbreak, which has infected Canadians in four provinces.</p>
<p>B.C. and Ontario each added three confirmed cases to their tallies yesterday, all mild. The other cases are in Alberta and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>"Regardless of (at) what level the World Health Organization decides to set its alert, I want to reassure Canadians that our government is prepared to deal with this situation head on," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said at a daily news briefing.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones added Canada is already operating at an escalated alert level because of the cases that have been confirmed here.</p>
<p>The first ones were confirmed on Sunday.</p>
<p>"If this continues and WHO goes to Level 6, basically for us, we're functioning in that way now," he said.</p>
<p>"Whether it's 4 or 5 or 6, that's just a number. It's our planning, preparation and response that really count."</p>
<p>Canada's pandemic influenza plan, developed in 2006, contains a range of measures that could be implemented in the event a pandemic arrives. They could include widespread immunization, closing schools or other public places, and isolating infected people.</p>
<p>Chan also called for help to assist developing countries deal with the situation.</p>
<p>In Mexico City, the government called yesterday for non-essential parts of the economy to shut down between May 1-5 to help combat the outbreak. Health Minister Jose Angel Cordova said food, medical and transportation sectors would not be affected.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sex, murder and the outbreak of moral panic</b>
</div><div>Ivor Tossell   </div>
<div>967 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>A good panic doesn't just come out of nowhere. Sure, it seems effortless in the moment – the worried headlines, the nervous commentators, the lunchroom buzz – but really, it takes years of preparation to work up phobias that can be released on a moment's notice. Take the swine flu that's got everyone so jumpy this week. Pandemics loom large in the public imagination when it comes to apocalypse scenarios, right up there with having our robotic servants turn on us. We wouldn't be so worried that the flu would be the end of us if we hadn't been looking askance at every dead bird since the summer of SARS. This is one well-rehearsed freak-out.</p>
<p>In a way, the same can be said for the “<span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer” story that bumped the swine flu from the news (and none too soon). The label refers to one Philip Markoff, a 23-year-old Boston medical student who is charged with the murder of a woman who had posted an erotic ad on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>. Markoff allegedly answered her ad, later corresponding with her over e-mail and cellphone.It's hard to pin down exactly why the “<span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer” nickname stuck, but it did. Maybe it's our curious affinity for giving murderers the same kind of handles we give superheroes. Maybe it's the alliterative way that “the <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer” rolls off the tongue; it's certainly more assonant than “The <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, then E-mail and Cellphone Killer.” But judging by the way the case sparked a moral panic about <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> itself, the ready association people drew between the two words seems more than just phonetic.</p>
<p>The copious coverage that followed seemed to feature almost as many screenshots of <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> as they did pictures of the suspect himself. Columnists sounded off about the Internet's dark corners. Local TV news squads took to the streets, filming passersby as they shook their heads and vowed they'd never answer an ad from those creeps online.</p>
<p>And then there was a bizarre piece on ABC's Nightline, in which anchor Martin Bashir perched on the edge of founder Craig Newmark's desk and demanded to know whether Newmark is a “law-abiding citizen of America,” and if so, why he's facilitating prostitution by allowing naughty ads on his website.</p>
<p>Newmark mumbled a sort of uncategorical non-denial, but he wasn't lacking for defenders. It didn't take long for people to start pointing out the patently obvious: There is nothing about <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> that contributed to this crime. Connecting <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> to the actions of someone who answers an ad is as silly as blaming a newspaper for the actions of someone who answered an ad and did something terrible. The prudish can get worked up about the fact that <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> runs plenty of thinly veiled ads from prostitutes – but here, that's tantamount to blaming the victim: She advertised, therefore she was asking for it.</p>
<p>But just like any other outbreak of hysteria, this didn't come from nowhere. The <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> moral panic had been brewing out of sight, waiting for its moment to erupt. It's tempting to write this off as another case of semi-informed Internet phobia – remember the moral panic over MySpace, which was said to be full of child predators? – but while there's no connection between <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> and the crime, it does shoulder responsibility for the panic.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> has always walked a fine line between anarchy and grungy respectability. It made its name as the under-moderated, anything-goes website. Craig Newmark has curated an image for himself as a disinterested broker whose motivations are neither corporate, commercial nor moral. He's just a guy named Craig, see, and he's got this list, and he wants to help people connect – that's his shtick.</p>
<p>There's something disconcerting about <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>'s amoral nature. The company seems to float above the mores of commerce and law. It eviscerated the classified-advertising market that supported the newspaper business, but didn't keep most of the proceeds for itself. Newmark is said to make a pretty penny, but he's not selling the site for the usual Silicon Valley billions. Instead, he gives most of its services away for free.</p>
<p>And the laissez-faire nature of those services helped make him. The fact that those who would exchange sex for cash are among the millions who advertise on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> is probably more shocking to people who don't live in cities where alt-weekly newspapers run porny ads for escort services all the time. But even for the hardened, <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> occasionally comes out with something truly eye-popping: I vividly recall discovering shelter-for-sex ads on <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> after Katrina hit New Orleans.</p>
<p>The libertine act comes at a price. <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> is a pile of contradictions that nobody knows quite how to read. It's not bound by the rules of a corporation trying to look good or a non-profit trying to do good, and it's riddled with salaciousness.</p>
<p>It's a great formula, but all it took was a scandalous news story that involved some possible combination of sex, a murder and <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span>, and everybody's worst assumptions about the site seemed to have been realized. It didn't matter that the shoe, as it were, didn't fit. <span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> has been plaguing the Internet with diffuse anxiety for years, even as we enjoyed its services. I can't feel too bad for Craig and his list, this week. It's no fair that they got stuck with the “<span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> killer.” But this is a panic that was waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Alberta's medical system has been on alert for swine flu since Sunday and has already detected two mild cases of the disease in the province.</p>
<p>All doctors in Alberta have been asked to practise "enhanced surveillance" for flu-like illness, particularly when there is a history of travel to Mexico or the southern United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, chief medical officer of health for Alberta, said the province's operational centre was activated on the weekend, before the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level.</p>
<p>\Alberta has also ramped up its laboratory testing capacity and is now testing potential cases for swine flu itself, rather than sending samples to the national lab in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Alberta Health said medical professionals have also been provided with advice about managing suspected cases.</p>

<p>At times it seems as if sorting out even the most basic dimensions of the current swine-flu situation is as complex, confusing and confounding as actually fashioning an antiviral solution in a research laboratory must be.</p>
<p>Certainly the "laboratory" of public opinion and political response can be far removed from the realm of the scientific and rational.</p>
<p>By midday Wednesday, even the very evidence of Mexican fatalities that sparked global concerns of a pandemic had changed. With input from specialized laboratories in Canada and the United States, and in conjunction with the World Health Agency, the Mexican health minister had downgraded the number of "positive" confirmed deaths from a new strain of influenza to seven from a previously reported 20. "Probable" deaths in Mexico from the H1N1 virus remained relatively constant at 159, up slightly from an earlier figure of 152. But who knows if that will remain constant?</p>
<p>At the same time, the first fatality in the U.S. was reported, a Mexican toddler who had travelled north with his family to Texas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the spreading virus continues to be tracked around the world, spurring reactions ranging from the slaughtering of pigs in Egypt to forcing first-division soccer matches in Mexico be played in empty stadiums.</p>
<p>Here at home in Edmonton, where no cases have been reported at this writing, flights and school trips are being cancelled. With two provincial confirmed cases -- one in Calgary, the other in northern Alberta -- many parents fret over the status of coughing kids, and jam public health hotlines.</p>
<p>No surprisingly, there is conflicting evidence about the readiness of health systems here and abroad. Some overwrought local parents complained about hospital unpreparedness, as Premier Ed Stelmach implored Albertans to calm down and avoid panic.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, there was encouraging news that, for once, politics was actually taking a back seat to co-operation.</p>
<p>Rookie federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, who performed the same job for Nunavut during the SARS outbreak of 2003, has provided smart, steady leadership on the emerging swine-flu file, maintaining a dialogue with her opposition counterparts.</p>
<p>Alberta's unflappable chief medical officer of health Andre Corriveau has also counselled caution, to the point of questioning school-board decisions scrapping trips. Wednesday morning, students from Calgary's Bishop Carroll High School took off for a New York musical festival after parents voted to overturn a school district ban.</p>
<p>But then, Canadians' worries about the possibility of something worse than the mild symptoms registered here to date are anything but farfetched.</p>
<p>By Wednesday afternoon, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level for the second time this week, to a Phase 5, which indicates human-to-human spread in at least two countries and only a single notch lower than Phase 6, which indicates a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>All of which, as the situation changes hourly, gives one pause to wonder just what is happening and whether those in a position to protect us have a handle on the situation.</p>
<p>To be sure, panic is never a wise approach. Common-sense measures such as covering coughs, frequently washing hands, staying home when sick and seeking professional advice remain key. Indeed, that is about all we can do until further notice, hoping against hope that this scare remains just that.</p>
<p>As we've seen yet again, the world continues to get smaller, faster, more interconnected and -- yes -- sometimes more frightening with each passing year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>School trips felled by flu fears; Band students return home after just one day in California</b>

</p>
<p>Fifty band students from Archbishop MacDonald High School saw little of Los Angeles except the airport this week after being ordered by their school board to return home due to rising fears about swine flu.</p>
<p>Just hours after leaving Edmonton, students from the school's concert and jazz band were ordered by Edmonton Catholic Schools officials Tuesday to return without setting foot in Disneyland, where they had planned to perform in a music festival as part of a five-night trip.</p>
<p>"I was disappointed," Kelsey Johnson, 17, said Wednesday from Edmonton International Airport, not long after the World Health Organization increased its pandemic alert level to five on a scale of six.</p>
<p>"There was not a single person on this trip who wasn't."</p>
<p>The band trip was a major casualty of a decision by two Edmonton school districts to severely curtail travel both in Canada and abroad due to concerns about the spread of the swine flu beyond Mexico.</p>
<p>"You can make the best of a situation or you can make the worst of a situation and luckily, this group decided to make the best of it," said Johnson, a Grade 12 clarinet player who spent the last year helping plan for the trip.</p>
<p>Both Edmonton Catholic and Edmonton Public officials defended the travel restrictions and trip cancellations Wednesday, as some questioned whether the steps were an overreaction given that Mexico was the only country currently listed as a no-go zone by Canada's Public Health Agency.</p>
<p>Edmonton Public Schools suspended all international travel and air travel within Canada earlier this week, but did not make students on two school trips in B.C. or trips in Montreal and Ottawa come home early. Bus travel within Canada will still be allowed.</p>
<p>Four public high schools, including Ross Sheppard, Victoria, Jasper Place and the Edmonton Christian High School, cancelled plans this weekend for a bus trip to Spokane, Wash., to participate in the annual Bloomsday run.</p>
<p>More than 250 students had been training for the run. Several students from the Edmonton Christian West school, slated to fly to Quebec for an exchange program, also had their trip cancelled.</p>
<p>Edmonton Public Supt. Edgar Schmidt said at Tuesday night's school board meeting that he was aware students, teachers and parents will be upset about cancelled plans.</p>
<p>"In the last several hours, we have made some difficult decisions," Schmidt said. "Know they were not made lightly.</p>
<p>Edmonton Catholic Schools took its travel restrictions even further, putting a stop to all field trips outside Alberta and forcing groups that had already left to come home.</p>
<p>In addition to Archbishop MacDonald's band, three other school bands en route to Vancouver had to turn their buses around.</p>
<p>"For our district, it was the best decision we could make," Edmonton Catholic spokeswoman Lori Nagy said. "Ultimately, we're responsible for 850 students who would be travelling in the next month. We have to take into consideration exposing our students to a very viable health risk."</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer of health suggested halting out-of-province or out-of-country travel was an overreaction, saying that's not the advice he has provided to his own department.</p>
<p>"It's not something I feel is necessary, certainly for travel around Canada or even in the United States or Europe," Andre Corriveau said.</p>
<p>"We have a travel advisory for Mexico at this point on time, but school boards are run by parents and they take decisions based on their feeling for it."</p>
<p>Edmonton Public School trustee Gerry Gibeault tried to get the school board to talk about the district's swine flu response Tuesday night, but failed to get unanimous approval to waive the traditional two-week notice needed to add a topic to the agenda.</p>
<p>Gibeault questioned why the district is imposing tighter travel restrictions than those recommended by public health officials.</p>
<p>Some Archbishop MacDonald students returning to Edmonton, and their parents, had similar concerns.</p>
<p>String bass player Mike Hennig said it was a particularly disappointing end to his first international trip, since he worked for hours at his job in a clothing store to earn the $1,600 to go.</p>

<p>Soccer - Manchester United's 1-0 victory over visiting Arsenal in the first leg of an all-English European Champions League semifinal might have been costly for the defending champion Wednesday. Central defender Rio Ferdinand was sent to hospital for tests after Wednesday's match to determine whether he has a broken rib, which could cause him to miss the second leg. John O'Shea scored the goal.</p>
<p>Curling - Pat Sanders of Victoria won twice in women's action Wednesday at the world senior championships in Dunedin, N. Z. Canada (5-0) beat the U. S. 7-5 and the Kiwis 12-5. in men's play, Canada's Eugene Hritzuk of Saskatoon (4-0) beat England 10-2.</p>
<p>Golf - Two pro tours on Wednesday postponed tournaments in Mexico due to the swine flu outbreak. The Canadian Tour postponed this week's San Luis Potosi Open, the day after it postponed two other events in Mexico -- the Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open -- slated to follow the San Luis Potosi Open. The nationwide tour postponed the Mexico open, slated for may 18-24 at The El Bosque Golf Club in Leon, Guanajuato.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Remembering lessons at SARS ground zero; Hotel guest's sneeze was felt around the world</b>
</div><div>Duncan Mavin   </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>722 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>E8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>At the Metropark Hotel on the quieter end of Kowloon's Waterloo Road, there was no sign Wednesday that this hotel had been ground zero for the last major threat of a global pandemic prior to the current swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Milling around in the lobby, a handful of tourists and business types seemed oblivious to the hotel's past. There was no hand sanitizer on display, and there was no box of surgical masks for guests.</p>
<p>When the hotel's public relations department was offered the chance to state what they have done to combat another health crisis, they declined to comment.</p>
<p>Yet it is just six years since Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS, was traced eventually to a sneezing guest from the mainland in the elevator at the Metropark -- or Metropole as it was called before management gave it a new name.</p>
<p>That sneeze sent SARS around the world, left Hong Kong's tourist industry in tatters, and battered the city's economy too.</p>
<p>In spring of 2003, hotels like the Metropole and restaurants throughout Hong Kong that were usually filled with the conference goers, bankers and traders that the city thrives on were emptied for months. Property prices that had barely recovered from the Asian Financial Crisis of a few years earlier plunged to new lows.</p>
<p>The benchmark index of the Hong Kong Stock Exchange lost almost a fifth of its value in less than five months.</p>
<p>There was even -- and this is a sign of how bad things got -- a drop in shopping, with retails sales down by 15% and malls eerily quiet.</p>
<p>People here still talk of 2003 and SARS as a historic moment, and they judge the impact of other events -- like the current financial crisis -- by comparison to SARS, saying restaurants are still relatively full or house prices have not declined the way they did in 2003.</p>
<p>Although it appears the threat of another major healthscare is having little impact on operations at the Metropark, the city's authorities insist they are not taking swine flu lightly, and insist they are better prepared this time around.</p>
<p>"We are making preparation for the worst scenario, although we hope that it will not happen," said secretary for food and health, Dr. York Chow.</p>
<p>Should a case of swine flu be confirmed in Hong Kong -- none has been so far -- there are plans in place to shut down schools and use holiday camps to quarantine patients. The government has already issued instructions on how to best avoid the illness -- sample: "Cover nose and mouth while sneezing or coughing and dispose of nasal and mouth discharges properly." And the ministry of labour has ordered that sick workers should be told to stay at home.</p>
<p>There are certain measures still in place from the SARS outbreak that will help too -- a ban on spitting, and thermal screening at the city's Chep Lap Kok airport, for instance.</p>
<p>Some in the private sector have pre-empted a repeat of SARS too. Office workers at some big corporations turned in today to find surgical masks were being made available to anyone who'd take one. In some apartment buildings, clear plastic sheeting that is sanitized regularly has been taped over the buttons in the elevator.</p>
<p>It is not surprising the city's officials are acting quickly. Hong Kong's economy is particularly vulnerable, because it is so dependent on trade and travel.</p>
<p>"Hong Kong is such a widely travelled international city, it is our responsibility to ensure that we should minimize the impact of this possible pandemic," Mr. Chow said.</p>
<p>The local economy shrank 2.6% as a result of SARS -- it was down by about 9% during the darkest days of the crisis -- and in the aftermath, Hong Kong's rolled out an array of costly measures to boost the economy, including tax cuts and loan guarantees.</p>
<p>The worst hit sector was tourism -- the number of visitors to Hong Kong plunged 70% according to some estimates. Owners of hotels like the Metropark will be hoping to avoid a repeat.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Obama pleased but not satisfied; After 100 days, president warns of more setbacks</b>
</div><div>Sheldon Alberts   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>973 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>M arking his own report card on the 100th day of a historic and already tumultuous presidency, Barack Obama on Wednesday declared himself pleased but"not satisfied" with efforts to pull the United States out of recession and clear out the economic "wreckage" he inherited upon taking office.</p>
<p>But while highlighting a few signature achievements and decisions --from the approval of a$787-billion stimulus package, to the planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison and a strategic shift in Afghanistan --Obama also cautioned Americans to gird themselves for a protracted fight to restore the nation's economic health and to resolve international crises.</p>
<p>"I am proud of what we have achieved, but I am not content. I am pleased with our progress, but I am not satisfied,"Obama said in prepared remarks before a prime time news conference Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Millions of Americans are still without jobs and homes, and more will be lost before this recession is over. Credit is still not flowing nearly as freely as it should."</p>
<p>Speaking earlier to an audience in Arnold, Mo., Obama sought to downplay expectations of a quick turnaround in the U. S economy.</p>
<p>"I'm not a miracle worker. We've got a lot of tough choices and hard decisions and hard work ahead of us,"Obama said.</p>
<p>"I want to warn you, there will be setbacks. It will take time."</p>
<p>Even as his aides dismissed the hoopla surrounding his 100th day in office as an artificial media construct, the White House used the occasion to seize the bully pulpit and to tout Obama's efforts to reshape the American economy and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, Obama sought to emphasize ways in which he is seeking to make a dramatic shift--in both style and substance--from the Bush administration. He also dismissed critics' claims his agenda is both too ambitious and radical to be successful.</p>
<p>"There's no mystery to what we've done," Obama said. "You may not always agree with me, but if you take a look at what I said I was going to do when I was running for office, and you now look at what we are in the middle of doing, we're doing what we said we'd do."</p>
<p>Since taking office, Obama has embarked on a dizzying array of initiatives compared in scope to those launched by President Franklin D. Roosevelt upon taking office in 1933. Roosevelt ushered in the New Deal by winning approval for 15 major pieces of legislation through Congress during his first 100 days.</p>
<p>Obama's biggest achievement has been the passage of the $787-billion American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in February.</p>
<p>He also won on Wednesday congressional approval for a$3.4-trillion budget that includes proposals for dramatic reforms in health care, climate change and energy policy.</p>
<p>Republicans said the budget signalled a low point, rather than a high one, in Obama's young presidency.</p>
<p>"It spends money we don't have, piles unprecedented debt on our children and grandchildren," said Representative John Boehner, the House Republican leader.</p>
<p>In addition to the budget and stimulus package, Obama has set in motion a $1-trillion plan to rescue troubled banks;has effectively imposed control over the U. S. auto industry; and has pushed forward with plans to raise taxes on wealthy Americans.</p>
<p>On the international front, Obama's headline-grabbing moves have included setting an August 2010 time-table for withdrawal of combat troops in Iraq and the deployment of 21,000 new troops to Afghanistan. But he also has made overtures to improve relations with Russia, Iran, Cuba and Venezuela, as well as with traditional allies in Europe.</p>
<p>Obama's popularity among Americans has held relatively steady, despite the economic upheaval.Obama's approval rating stood at 63 per cent on Wednesday, according to Gallup, down from near 70 per cent on Jan. 21.</p>
<p>"On our first day in office we found challenges of unprecedented size and scope,"Obama said in Missouri, citing the "most serious downturn since the Great Depression."</p>
<p>Despite the breadth of the economic crisis, Obama defended his decision to plunge forward with health-care reform and the pursuit of a clean-energy economy no longer "trapped by our dangerous dependence on foreign oil."</p>

<p>Concerns about swine flu continued to grow in Alberta as the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level again Wednesday, with worried patients heading to Calgary doctors offices and some local businesses even disinfecting buildings.</p>
<p>While Alberta Health said the number of confirmed swine flu cases in the province remains at two -- adding the current risk to the average Albertan is low -- physicians said they have had a surge in patients worried about the outbreak.</p>
<p>"None of us have seen anything that looks like influenza A, but we're getting lots of questions," said Dr. Richard Ward, president of the Alberta College of Family Physicians.</p>
<p>Some organizations, including SAIT, are disinfecting surface areas, such as elevator buttons and handrails, as a preventive measure against the new virus, which has caused mild infections in 19 Canadians.</p>
<p>At the Bankers Hall complex in downtown Calgary, janitorial staff conducted extra sanitizing of a work area and some washrooms. A spokeswoman for <span class="companylink">Brookfield Properties</span>, which owns Bankers Hall, said the company took the steps after learning the adult son of an employee in the building was one of Alberta's swine flu cases.</p>
<p>Alberta Health officials will not comment on details about individual cases.</p>
<p>"We followed the industry standard cleaning protocols," said Melissa Coley, spokeswoman for Brookfield.</p>
<p>The unidentified worker had no symptoms but was sent home as a precaution.</p>
<p>Alberta announced Tuesday that it has confirmed two mild cases of human swine flu.</p>
<p>Alberta Health officials said one of the cases was a young boy from northern Alberta, while the second infection was in a young man from Calgary. Both had recently travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>British Columbia and Ontario both reported three new cases of swine flu -- all mild -- on Wednesday, bringing the Canadian total to 19.</p>
<p>In Alberta, the province's top doctor has tried to minimize worries about the disease, saying he is only concerned about Albertans with symptoms of the disease who have recently travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>"We are dealing with some-thing that is new and it's causing a lot of interest," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, chief medical officer of health for Alberta.</p>
<p>"I have an important role to play in terms of keeping my head cool . . . and reassuring the general public who is not at risk at this point in time."</p>
<p>But with the number of swine flu cases growing around the world, many individuals and organizations are still taking precautions.</p>
<p>The Calgary Board of Education is conducting risk assessments on employees and students who have been travelling recently and providing them with information about swine flu, said spokesman Ted Flitton.</p>
<p>Several local pharmacies said they have sold out of supplies of Tamiflu, an antiviral drug that can treat influenza.</p>
<p>"The first prescription on Monday cleaned us out," said Anita Kan, a pharmacist at a northwest Super Drug Mart.</p>
<p>Experts have warned people against taking Tamiflu and other antivirals as a preventive measure, saying the virus can become resistant to the drug if it's overused.</p>
<p>Alberta has a stockpile of about 6.7 million doses of Tamiflu.</p>

</p>
<p>Although the new H1n1 swine flu it is not yet a pandemic -- a global epidemic of a new and serious disease -- it could quickly start one. Here are a few ways the situation could develop:</p>
<p>Severe Pandemic</p>
<p>This is the worst-case scenario. every 30 to 40 years the world suffers an influenza pandemic, with a new strain of flu spreading rapidly, causing serious disease and killing hundreds of thousands of people within a few weeks. the 1918 pandemic is considered the worst-case scenario. at least 40 million people died in 18 months and the epidemics passed over communities in waves.</p>
<p>But that was in the pre-antibiotic era, in a time when even simple infections killed people, no mechanical ventilators were available and vaccines were primitive at best. the general population had little idea of how diseases were transmitted. even so, experts predict a 1918-like flu would keep 40 per cent of the workforce out at any time. if this kind of pandemic struck today, millions could die, world trade would slow to a crawl and many economies would crumble.</p>
<p>Mild Pandemic</p>
<p>This last happened in 1968. the H3n2 strain killed an estimated 1 million people. experts predict that a strain of such virulence today would have less severe effects, with antivirals available that were not on the market 40 years ago. even with vaccines, drugs and better public education, ordinary seasonal flu kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people every year. the difference with a pandemic strain is that there would not immediately be a vaccine against it and it would likely cause serious disease among broader age groups than the very young, very old and immune-compromised.</p>
<p>No Pandemic</p>
<p>Everyone is hoping this flu strain will just fizzle out. influenza is a promiscuous virus, readily swapping genes with other flu viruses in a person's or animal's body. it also mutates constantly. both these factors mean it can quickly grow worse, or become milder. it could at any time lose its ability to transmit easily from one person to another, or could become as mild as regular, seasonal flu. but it would take months to know whether this has happened. flu strains often disappear over the summer months, reemerging in late summer or early autumn. the 1918 flu strain did this with a vengeance.</p>

<p>If swine flu turns into a fast-evolving, lethal pandemic, who should get what, when? Would doctors and nurses have an "unbounded obligation" to care for the sick and dying if it means putting their own lives at risk? Who gets Tamiflu, who gets the vaccine, who gets the ventilated beds in the intensive care unit?</p>
<p>"The last thing you want is arguments at the door of the intensive care unit between relatives who have sick patients and busy, overburdened clinicians,"says Dr. Ross Upshur, director of the University of Toronto's Joint Centre for Bioethics.</p>
<p>The arrival of a novel flu bug from Mexico -- not Asia, as most experts assumed would happen--means authorities may not get the months of lead time they were hoping for to prepare for a pandemic.</p>
<p>"Everyone thought the next pandemic would come from Asia . . . and there would be time to prepare. But holy cow it is Mexico, and cases are al-ready here," Dr. Ronald St.John, former director general of the Public Health Agency of Canada's Centre for Emergency Preparedness and Response says in an article just released by the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>"The hope was that while we were in a pre-pandemic phase we would be able to engage in discussion and deliberation and sort these things out,"Upshur said in an interview. "If this turns into a more fast-evolving, global</p>
<p>pandemic, clearly leaders are going to have to make decisions, but they will be publicly accountable for them.They're going to need to articulate the reasons why they made the choices that they did."</p>
<p>Others are warning that as the outbreak grows worse, cracks will begin to show in Canada's response.</p>
<p>Only one province--Ontario -- is under obligation to share information with the federal government or the rest of Canada during a disease outbreak, because they signed an agreement after the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>"If we had simultaneous swine flu epidemics in humans and pigs, the fact that pigs were getting infected would have to be reported by the provinces to Ottawa, and Ottawa would have the power to quarantine individual pig farms, or order destruction of the pigs," says Amir Attaran, Canada research chair in law, population health and global development policy at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"But as soon as the farmer on the same farm acquired the infection, Ottawa has no power to either quarantine or compel the person to get into medical supervision, or anything."</p>
<p>Attaran says it's "notoriously the case" that, during epidemics, people refuse to self-isolate. During SARS, the compliance rates was under 60 per cent. "Yet there is this cultural belief that affected citizens will dutifully skip work or school, call off social engagements and do so for days and weeks in order to self-isolate."</p>
<p>He and others predict the swine flu outbreak will only get worse. "It's 100 per cent certain the extent will continue to spread. By the time this is over, there won't be a province in the country not affected by it," Attaran says.</p>
<p>Canada added six more cases of H1N1 swine flu to its national toll Wednesday, bringing the total number to 19.</p>

<p>The Canadian Tour has indefinitely postponed the San Luis Potosi Open because of the spread of swine flu, and is working diligently with its travel partners to get its members and officials out of Mexico.</p>
<p>The Tour took the step Wednesday after the World Health Organization said the swine flu outbreak is moving closer to becoming a pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's clear that the virus is spreading and we don't see any evidence of this slowing down at this point," WHO flu chief Keiji Fukuda told a news conference in Geneva, Switzerland.</p>
<p>He said the virus is approaching, but not quite at the fifth phase of pandemic alert -- a point where widespread human infection is apparent.</p>
<p>On Tuesday the Tour postponed its next two events in Mexico -- the Yucatan Country Club Classic and the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open -- that were scheduled to be held in the next two weeks. The San Luis Potosi Open was scheduled to begin play today.</p>

</p>
<p>Dan Twardzik proposed to Romayne Andronyk in January 2007, and for more than two years they looked forward to a warm-destination wedding.</p>
<p>Last April, the two 30-something insurance professionals booked their dream wedding in Puerta Vallarta, Mexico. Family and friends from as far away as Europe booked tickets to join them on their special day in the sun.</p>
<p>On Saturday -- one week before they were set to depart -- they started to hear talk of a virus spreading through Mexico. Sunday and Monday, they watched swine flu sweep around the globe, but remained certain that nothing would stop their wedding.</p>
<p>But when tour operators started cancelling flights to Mexico on Tuesday, it started to sink in that their dream wedding was in peril.</p>
<p>"We're financially committed," Twardzik said Wednesday morning at <span class="companylink">Uniglobe Geo Travel</span>, where the couple booked their wedding. " If we had our money back we could just wing it."</p>
<p>But the tour operator wouldn't easily agree to refund the money, and the couple spent the day on pins and needles waiting to hear whether Uniglobe could negotiate with the airline, and if they would be married on the beach.</p>
<p>Late Wednesday, Twardzik learned the travel agent at Uniglobe Geo was able to book them into a resort in the Dominican Republic. He was relieved, but still pensive.</p>
<p>"I'll be happy when we get there, get to the counter and they say: 'We've been expecting you,' " he said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Uniglobe Geo Travel</span> leisure marketing manager Rick MacSwain said at least six couples who booked with his company are in similar situations, and his destination wedding specialists worked until midnight Tuesday to try to find solutions to the nightmares.</p>
<p>Each tour operator the company works with has different policies, which are constantly in flux, he said.</p>
<p>"(The brides and grooms) are very upset ... they've planned for this in many cases for a year or more," he said. "It's just really frustrating. The best-case scenario is a full refund, the worst- case scenario is that they can't get space for another destination wedding."</p>
<p>Bruce Cran, president of the Consumers' Association of Canada, said there is little Twardzik and Andronyk can do besides negotiate with their travel agent and tour operator.</p>

<p>- Ah, a flu epidemic -- another molehill for our news media to embellish.</p>
<p>- Wait a minute: 2007 was the Year of the Pig.</p>
<p>- Let's hope Ron Liepert's next move isn't to dictate that only party members need line up for the swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>- Maybe The Journal should reserve weekly space for the Alberta Conservatives to make their constant apologies. For example: "I, Ron Liepert, apologize for being rude, cold and arrogant."</p>
<p>- Most people will go their entire lives without chiropractic, but everyone needs doctors and dentists. The government should pay for needed services only.</p>
<p>- Who keeps leaking all these memos about health care to the media? I've never seen a bunch of employees so eager to get rid of their boss.</p>
<p>- If the Alberta marketing people were so smart about using "visual representations to convey a concept," then why did they end up looking so stupid?</p>
<p>- I am old enough to remember a time when the media reported the news and didn't manufacture it.</p>
<p>- Let's hold a contest for Venters to submit a photo of Alberta, then we can choose the best one to represent the province.</p>
<p>- Any idea what that ad for Travel Alberta on the boards at the Honda Center in Anaheim is costing us?</p>

<p>- Because I drive a fuel-efficient, four-cylinder car, I felt guilty about not doing more to support the Alberta economy. But I do go to the casino occasionally, so I guess that makes up for it.</p>
<p>- Every year, the city comes out with a huge road-construction list, and every year they forget to add the railway underpass on 63rd Avenue and Argyll Road. It's a mess.</p>
<p>- How sad. We can build a multimillion-dollar complex for cats and dogs, but we can't seem to come up with money for women's and children's shelters.</p>
<p>- If you don't actually work at the Neil Crawford Centre, who does the new South Campus LRT station actually serve? The cows at the university farms?</p>

</div><div>Sheldon Alberts   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1107 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Early</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Marking his own report card on the 100th day of a historic and already tumultuous presidency, Barack Obama on Wednesday declared himself pleased but "not satisfied" with efforts to pull the United States out of recession and clear out the economic "wreckage" he inherited upon taking office.</p>
<p>But while highlighting a few signature achievements and decisions -- from the approval of a $787-billion stimulus package, to the planned closure of the Guantanamo Bay prison and a strategic shift in Afghanistan -- Obama also cautioned Americans to gird themselves for a protracted fight to restore the nation's economic health and to resolve international crises.</p>
<p>"I am proud of what we have achieved, but I am not content. I am pleased with our progress, but I am not satisfied," Obama said at a White House news conference Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>Speaking earlier to an audience in Arnold, Mo., Obama sought to downplay expectations of a quick turnaround in the U.S. economy. "I'm not a miracle worker. We've got a lot of tough choices and hard decisions and hard work ahead of us," Obama said. "I want to warn you, there will be setbacks. It will take time."</p>
<p>Even as his aides dismissed the hoopla surrounding his 100th day in office as an artificial media construct, the White House used the occasion to seize the bully pulpit and to tout his efforts to reshape the U.S. economy and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Obama organized a campaign-style town-hall meeting in Missouri and then -- for the third time since taking office -- commandeered an hour of prime-time network television for a live news conference to note the occasion.</p>
<p>AN EYE-OPENER FOR NEW PRESIDENT</p>
<p>Known for exuding confidence even as an underdog Democratic presidential candidate, Obama acknowledged he has been taken aback by the sheer volume of problems he has faced so early in his presidency.</p>
<p>"Obviously I didn't anticipate the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression," Obama said. "The typical president has two or three big problems. We've got seven or eight big problems. So we have had to move very quickly."</p>
<p>Throughout the day, Obama sought to emphasize ways in which he is seeking to make a dramatic shift -- in both style and substance -- from the Bush administration. He also dismissed critics' claims his agenda is both too ambitious and radical to be successful.</p>
<p>"There's no mystery to what we've done," Obama said. "You may not always agree with me, but ... we're doing what we said we'd do."</p>
<p>Asked what had humbled him since entering the White House, Obama said he now understands the limits of presidential power and realizes that "change" is much harder to deliver than promise.</p>
<p>"The presidency is extraordinarily powerful,but we are just part of a much broader tapestry of American life. There are a lot of different power centres," he said. "I can't just press a button and have the bankers do exactly what I want or turn on a switch and suddenly Congress falls in line."</p>
<p>Obama's popularity among Americans has held relatively steady, despite the economic upheaval. Obama's approval rating stood at 63 per cent on Wednesday, according to Gallup, down from near 70 per cent on Jan. 21.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A virus by another name would make pork producers much happier</b>
</div><div>Keith Gerein   </div>

</p>
<p>Canadian back bacon, ham and sausages could soon be off many menus due to rising hysteria over swine influenza, say worried pork producers.</p>
<p>The industry, already suffering in part from regulatory changes in the United States, can ill afford an image problem with its products, said Gary Stordy of the Canadian Pork Council. Yet as the virus spreads around the world, so do misconceptions about its name.</p>
<p>"With the industry being associated with the name and a number of the news stories having pictures of pigs, it's eroding consumer confidence in Canadian products," he said.</p>
<p>"We'd really prefer to see it called the North American flu or some other name," said Jodi Bakke, director of policy and communications for Alberta Pork Producers.</p>
<p>The swine flu moniker is not only affecting domestic sales but could have disastrous implications for Canada's $2-billion-a-year export market, Stordy said.</p>
<p>More than 50 per cent of the pork produced in Canada is shipped to other countries, including big customers such as United States, Japan, Russia, Hong Kong and South Korea.</p>
<p>While none of those countries has yet imposed a ban on Canadian products, there is growing concern it may soon happen, Stordy said.</p>
<p>"It's our understanding that some exporters who ship to our major markets are having trouble closing some deals. I'm not saying they can't, but there is certainly a lot of questions going on."</p>
<p>Swine flu got its name because, at a molecular level, the virus most closely resembles strains known to infect pigs. But so far there is no evidence the human illness has been transmitted from pigs, said Stephen Shafran, an infectious disease expert at the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>Import restrictions on Mexican, American and Canadian pork based on such fears are "not rational," he said.</p>
<p>Stordy said there is no sign of a flu outbreak in Canadian pig herds.</p>

</p>
<p>As Canada's swine flu infection total reached 19 on Wednesday, the World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level to its second-highest phase and urged nations to "ramp up" their preparations for a possible pandemic.</p>
<p>By raising the level from four to five, WHO is indicating a pandemic is likely imminent and countries should take certain actions with an increased sense of urgency in order to get ready for it. "All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans," WHO Director General Margaret Chan said in Geneva.</p>
<p>According to WHO's guidelines, a Phase 5 is reached when there is human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries. On Monday, WHO raised the level from three to four which meant a pandemic was possible, but not inevitable.</p>
<p>The global spread of the virus, which originated in Mexico and is suspected of making more than 2,000 people there sick, has moved quickly since then.</p>
<p>"This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal to governments ... to the pharmaceutical industry and the business community, that certain actions now should be undertaken with increased urgency and an accelerated pace," said Chan.</p>
<p>She made her decision after intensive consultations with experts studying the swine virus that has infected more than 140 people in at least seven countries, and earlier Wednesday claimed its first fatality outside of Mexico, where the illness is believed to have killed more than 150.</p>
<p>The victim in the United States was a toddler, a Mexican citizen who was visiting Texas, who died in hospital after quickly falling ill.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said WHO raising the alert doesn't fundamentally change Ottawa's course of action in responding to the swine flu outbreak, which has infected Canadians in four different provinces.</p>
<p>British Columbia and Ontario each added three confirmed cases to their tallies Wednesday, all mild. The other cases are in Alberta and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>"Regardless of (at) what level the World Health Organization decides to set its alert, I want to reassure Canadians that our government is prepared to deal with this situation head-on," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said at a daily news briefing.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones added Canada is already operating at an escalated alert level because of the cases that have been confirmed here.</p>
<p>Canada's pandemic plan, developed in 2006, contains a range of measures that could be implemented should a pandemic arrive. They could include widespread immunization, closing schools and public places, and isolating infected people.</p>
<p>Chan -- director general of WHO -- also called for help to assist developing countries deal with the situation. Similar to Canada, American health officials said Wednesday they have been preparing "all along" for the situation to progress to a Level 6, the global pandemic phase.</p>
<p>"We are preparing for the worst, hoping for the best," said Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano.</p>
<p>The U.S., which reported 91 confirmed cases of swine flu in 10 different states, has already declared a public health emergency and President Barack Obama has asked Congress for $1.5 billion in emergency funding should the outbreak become more widespread in that country.</p>
<p>"If you are feeling certain flu symptoms, don't get on an airplane, don't get on any system of public transportation where you're confined and you could potentially spread the virus," the U.S. president said.</p>
<p>Obama said he wasn't considering closing the U.S. border with Mexico, saying "it would be akin to closing the barn door after the horses are out, because we already have cases here in the United States."</p>
<p>Pig farmers in Canada, the U.S. and Mexico are also taking a hit from the restrictions imposed by several countries. In an attempt to further stress that the swine flu is being spread among people, U.S. officials said they will now be calling the new virus strain the "2009 H1N1 flu."</p>
<p>The outbreak is having a massive impact on trade and travel between countries. Travel warnings from several countries have prompted tour operators and airlines to cancel trips to Mexico.</p>
<p>Mexico City has virtually been shut down, with schools, businesses, and other public places closed down.</p>

</div><div>Iain MacIntyre   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>928 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>E3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>We've never seen anything like it, and the series hasn't even started.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Canucks, unwavering in their meticulous 39-year march towards the Stanley Cup, will have gone nine days between games -- during the playoffs! -- when they finally open the National Hockey League's second round tonight against the Chicago Blackhawks.</p>
<p>There were 53 journalists, broadcasters and camera operators in the Canuck dressing room after Wednesday morning's practice, an NHL media attendance record for any chamber devoid of chicken wings or Sean Avery.</p>
<p>If given a vote, they (the media, not the wings or wingnut) would have overwhelmingly picked the Canucks to win this series because nearly everyone seems to be. Even the monkey in Toronto picked the Canucks. No, the actual monkey.</p>
<p>The Canucks are Canada's team and for all the Blackhawks' dynamic speed and skill and potential and momentum, it seems the only things that can stop Vancouver are a flu pandemic or colossal loss of form by goalie Roberto Luongo.</p>
<p>Or an injury to Luongo, which seemed at least remotely possible when Canuck defenceman Mattias Ohlund hit him in the mask with a soft shot late in Wednesday's practice.</p>
<p>"I did?" Ohlund asked.</p>
<p>Yeah, you skated behind the net after the shot and pretended not to notice Luongo staring a hole through you, acting like a schoolboy miscreant who has just beaned the back of the teacher's head with a spitball.</p>
<p>"Oh, yeah, I did," Ohlund said. "But it wasn't very hard."</p>
<p>Well, that's good.</p>
<p>Given that the Canucks are healthier than any playoff team has the right to be, devoted to conditioning and ridiculously rested, a mass outbreak of injuries or swine flu is highly unlikely. Which brings us to Luongo.</p>
<p>From the moment the Canucks swept aside the St. Louis Blues in four games, earning Vancouver the first happy holiday in April in franchise history, the break in the schedule was always going to be a good thing for the team.</p>
<p>But would it be good for Luongo?</p>
<p>The goalie, driven to get his gloves on a Stanley Cup, takes about as much time off as <span class="companylink">Google</span>. A day without practice -- usually the team has to sedate him or change practice time without telling him -- is like a sabbatical for Luongo. Nine days without a game is like a prison sentence.</p>
<p>He loves to be on the ice every day, play every second night and against the Blues was merely 4-0 with a 1.15 goals-against-average and .962 save percentage. Let's see <span class="companylink">Google</span> post numbers like that.</p>
<p>It was natural, therefore, there would be questions about the impact of the Canucks' layoff on their workaholic goalie. And, naturally, Luongo tired of these questions by about Day 2.</p>
<p>By Wednesday, Luongo was saying: "I know you think it's an issue, right? No, it's not. This is the playoffs. It's not the regular season or pre-season. I'm fine. I'm energized. I'm excited. I felt great in practice today and I really want to get things going here.</p>
<p>"I think you guys are reading way too much into it. It's been 10 days. It hasn't been two months, know what I mean? We played last week. It's not something that's going to be a factor. We're all hockey players; we all know what to do once we get on the ice. Once the adrenalin kicks in and we're ready to play and the fans are yelling, we'll be good to go."</p>
<p>Luongo gamely stood and answered questions for nearly 20 minutes, but said little. He may as well have been blogging.</p>
<p>But during the St. Louis series, to a reporter patient and diligent enough to hang around and ask the right questions (wasn't me), Luongo said: "Once you get to the playoffs there's always that extra level and some players, you don't know what it is, but they have it.</p>
<p>"That's the type of player I want to be. In the playoffs, with the chips down and facing the most crucial moment, you want to be at your best."</p>
<p>The theory that the layoff may have dulled Luongo is fueled less by the time between games than the goalie's history for starting slowly after inactivity.</p>
<p>He has required two or three weeks to cultivate his A-game at the start of each season in Vancouver, something the goalie readily admits and finds difficult to explain. And in January, after missing two months with the first serious injury of his career, Luongo lost his first five starts while positing an average of 3.70 and save percentage of .876.</p>
<p>Of course, last season, after missing four December games with a rib injury, Luongo won his first three starts with a 0.97 GAA and .968 save rate.</p>
<p>Still, it has been years since he was healthy and went nine days without playing. But he said these are the Stanley Cup playoffs and that changes things. He feels impervious.</p>
<p>"I don't know what the other team can do to get me off my game," he said.</p>
<p>Maybe nothing can.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No swine flu measures taken by municipalities -- yet; Libraries, community centres and schools could be closed and events such as New Westminster's May Day could be cancelled</b>
</div><div>Kelly Sinoski and Janet Steffenhagen   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun; With files from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>899 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Metro Vancouver municipalities aren't taking any aggressive action against the swine flu just yet, but if a pandemic is declared, they could close libraries, community centres and schools.</p>
<p>Big events such as New Westminster's annual May Day parade could also be cancelled to limit the spread of the disease, Mayor Wayne Wright said.</p>
<p>"We're watching it and if we have to take some steps with the public, we will," Wright said.</p>
<p>"We would have to work with the school board and probably ask people to obey medical laws if they need to wear masks or stay away from work. And we would stop anything that would have a large unnecessary crowd."</p>
<p>At least one provincial health officer is also recommending schools take some precautions now, starting with raising the temperature in the water in school washrooms.</p>
<p>Domenic Losito, of Vancouver Coastal Health, said schools should also ensure that washrooms have quality soap -- but not anti-bacterial soap -- in dispensers and throw-away towels.</p>
<p>"We send mixed messages to kids [when] we tell them to wash their hands but we don't provide them with the wherewithal to do it properly," he said.</p>
<p>Schools won't be pleased with that message because warmer water will cost money at a time when budgets are tight, Losito acknowledged. "Everybody has challenges and I understand that. But it's an important issue to stay on top of," Losito said.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization on Wednesday called for countries to step up action against the swine flu, which originated in Mexico, citing a Level 5 alert. Six cases have been identified in B.C., but are considered mild, and have not prompted health authorities or municipalities to activate their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>Municipalities said their focus is on educating staff to wash their hands and stay home if they're sick, but there's no effort to stockpile masks or take other measures, said Dave Jones, of New Westminster's emergency management program. Any other actions would follow the lead of the health authorities.</p>
<p>"We're looking at it as a business continuity point; how we can protect our employees because we don't want to be decimated should it get to that extent," Jones said, but added: "I don't think we're even at the point where we have to worry."</p>
<p>Gavin Wilson, spokesman for Vancouver Coastal Health Authority, said there are several factors to be considered before Vancouver Coastal would activate its pandemic plans.</p>
<p>The WHO would first have to elevate the current alert to a pandemic. Any action would depend on such things as severity of the illness, concentrated outbreaks in certain municipalities and the extent of community transmission.</p>
<p>"It's not as simple as we have X number of cases that's the triggering point," Wilson said.</p>
<p>Premier Gordon Campbell said Wednesday there is no cause for public alarm. He said visitors or tourists returning from Mexico are being screened and the province has sufficient supplies of Tamiflu to treat any cases. He warned anyone with flu-like symptoms to see their doctor, as "the quicker it is treated the better."</p>
<p>Stephen Corber, director of the Simon Fraser University faculty of health sciences' public health practice, said the cities and health authorities are taking the right approach. He said although the "worst-case scenario could be quite severe," municipalities still have time before they have to take drastic action.</p>
<p>"The outcome has reached British Columbia so we are involved and it makes sense to be vigilant at this point," he said.</p>
<p>"All of [the cases] have a potential spread but I don't see the need to cancel events or close facilities. But there is a need for cities to be prepared."</p>
<p>He noted the initial influenza pandemic in 1918 petered out early but a second wave caused more damage -- and the same could happen here.</p>
<p>Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson said the city is on "close watch" and is focusing on ensuring its core businesses are able to continue.</p>
<p>Surrey Mayor Dianne Watts said although the city hasn't yet reported a swine flu case, it's ready to tackle the problem if it arises. Surrey's plan suggests it could "eliminate unnecessary contact with the public" by closing non-essential public facilities such as libraries, sports facilities, community centres and schools.</p>
<p>Watts said Surrey would also offer its recreation centres to house people with the flu and offer resources to neighbouring communities.</p>
<p>Coquitlam Mayor Richard Stewart said those are also possibilities for his city.</p>
<p>"That's in our arsenal of things we would consider or have to consider if it gets to that point," he said, but added: "We're probably in much better shape partly because of the outbreak of SARS and other things we've seen in the past."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, David Weir, spokesman for the Vancouver board of education, said his district will check to ensure schools are meeting water-temperature standards. But Surrey school district spokesman Doug Strachan said the message has always been that soap -- not water temperature -- makes the difference.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Employers take action to deal with outbreak: 'Wash your hands'; Obligation to provide safe workplace goes beyond posters</b>
</div><div>Amy O'Brian   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>

<p>Hand-washing reminders are being posted in office washrooms and bottles of hand sanitizer are being placed near water coolers as businesses take measures against swine flu.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization announced Wednesday it had raised its pandemic alert to Level 5, prompting employers to remind employees about proper hygiene and ways to prevent spread of the disease.</p>
<p>"Every employer has an obligation to provide a safe workplace," said Earl Phillips, a labour and employment lawyer with the firm McCarthy Tetrault.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of employers are not just worried about production levels. They're worried about their staff."</p>
<p>While it is too soon for most businesses to consider sending healthy staff members home to work in isolation, Phillips said anyone with flu symptoms should stay home from work as a precaution.</p>
<p>"It's reasonable for employers to do a couple of things: Make sure your employees know what swine flu is and that it basically looks very much like typical influenza," Phillips said.</p>
<p>"And tell people, 'If you have these symptoms, stay home. Do not try to come to work if you have these symptoms.'"</p>
<p>Employers should also be reminding staff members about the need for proper hand-washing, proper sneezing and coughing etiquette, and keeping a distance from co-workers.</p>
<p>"Those are bits of information I think employers would do well to get out to their employees," he said.</p>
<p>"It helps them meet their obligation to provide a safe workplace and helps give their employees some sense of calm and security that things are being watched out for and things are under control."</p>
<p>Phillips said WHO's elevation of the alert level also gives employers more grounds to ask staff whether they have travelled to Mexico in the past two or three weeks.</p>
<p>An employee's vacation activities would not normally be of concern to an employer, but in this case, employers have a right to ask.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning was a key topic at Tuesday's Richmond conference of the Emergency Planning for Industry and Commerce Council.</p>
<p>Dr. Bonnie Henry, of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said to employers in a packed ballroom that the swine flu is a matter of concern for everyone in the province.</p>
<p>"There will be more cases," she said. "The next few weeks are going to be really important."</p>
<p>She repeated the importance of encouraging people to stay at home if they are exhibiting flu symptoms, saying today's society has a "presenteeism problem" that translates into sick people feeling obliged to go into the office.</p>
<p>"The other really, really important thing is handwashing. It's very, very simple.</p>
<p>"Wash your hands at least five times a day and you greatly reduce your chances of transmission," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>More cases expected as hundreds await test results; If you have a cough and fever, isolate yourself at home to minimize the chance of infecting others, health officials tell public</b>
</div><div>Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>589 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>

<p>The H1N1 swine flu has now infiltrated B.C.'s population, as one person contracted it from one of the five others in the province who got the new strain of influenza while on holidays in Mexico.</p>
<p>With the number of confirmed cases doubling overnight, public health officials indicated Wednesday that numbers will likely grow as there are "several hundred" B.C. residents awaiting test results for respiratory/flu typing by the provincial virology lab.</p>
<p>Dr. David Patrick of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, advised everyone waiting for test results or experiencing symptoms like cough and fever to isolate themselves at home to ensure they don't infect anyone else.</p>
<p>Some of those with symptoms may just have typical strains of seasonal influenza, which affects up to 20 per cent of the population in any given year.</p>
<p>The ramped up awareness of influenza has meant the provincial lab has seen a doubling in the number of specimens it usually examines each day, according to experts.</p>
<p>But since lab confirmation is only the tip of the iceberg, as Patrick pointed out, the fact that B.C. now has its first case of community transmission indicates the novel flu is definitely going to spread and linger.</p>
<p>The good news is that while some of the confirmed cases went to hospital for brief intravenous and other medical attention, only one of the three new cases required an overnight hospital stay in an undisclosed location.</p>
<p>Patrick said all six swine flu patients are now at home and he singled out for praise a Richmond man who was one of the earliest diagnosed cases.</p>
<p>"I take my hat off to this Lower Mainland gentleman because he had fever and cough and he took the week off to put himself in isolation. So he did all the right things to prevent the spread of viruses," Patrick said, referring to Ryan Windsor, a Richmond restaurant manager who went to the emergency department on April 24 and has been at home for a week.</p>
<p>In order to be successful, viruses have to multiply, but Patrick said people such as Windsor show they have the "power to disappoint" viruses if they minimize the opportunity for transmission.</p>
<p>Public health officials are looking for secondary transmissions, but there is no evidence at this point of a high rate of that, with only one out of the six cases fitting that profile. The community case is someone who did not go to Mexico but is "in contact with lots of travellers."</p>
<p>Patrick would not elaborate on the description of B.C.'s first secondary transmission case.</p>
<p>The B.C. government has taken stock of antiviral medications. "There is pretty good stock out there in hospitals and even if there were pressures on commercial stock [drugstores] we still have a plan in place to get our stockpiles to hospital should that be required," Patrick said, adding that B.C. has enough medication for 700,000 treatment courses.</p>
<p>The drugs must be taken in the first 48 hours to be effective in mitigating the symptoms of influenza. They are not designed to prevent influenza. Antiviral medication is being offered to patients who are in the acute stage of illness, especially if they tell their doctors they have just returned from Mexico.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pro returns to the game he loves - management; "Clubs dealing with critical drop in membership due to economy."</b>
</div><div>RANDY PHILLIPS   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>678 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>More than a decade has passed since Daniel Talbot worked in a management capacity at a golf club, but 2009 finds him doing it again and for all intents enjoying it more than he previously did.</p>
<p>The 56-year-old Montreal native, whose list of accomplishments as a competitive pro over the years is longer than most tee shots, has been installed as director of golf at the Country Club of Montreal in St. Lambert.</p>
<p>It's an interim position, filling in for Francis Bergeron, the club's long-time head pro who has been sidelined indefinitely by illness, but one that finds Talbot taking on a challenge that he is genuinely excited about.</p>
<p>"My mandate is taking care of anything and everything that has to do with golf," Talbot said. "Right now, the focus is recruiting new members, and I have to say I'm really enjoying it."</p>
<p>The Country Club celebrates its 100th anniversary in 2010, but this season, like a number of private clubs in the Montreal area, it is dealing with a critical drop in membership due primarily to the state of the economy.</p>
<p>"It's a fact that members, especially older ones who've seen their retirement portfolios shrink, are finding it hard to justify keeping their memberships," Talbot said.</p>
<p>"So with that, I'm here to try to help build something much like I did years ago at Le Mirage.</p>
<p>Talbot's first management post was at Le Mirage, the 36-hole facility in Terrebonne that was semi-private when it opened in 1993 before being bought by René Angélil and Céline Dion in 1997 and transformed into one of the most exclusive clubs in the province.</p>
<p>"Le Mirage was owned by four individuals when I was there and I was only dealing with one of them on a daily basis. Meetings were short and to the point," Talbot said.</p>
<p>"Here, it's a longer process because of the involvement of different committees made up of members. That's been a bit of an adjustment, but it's also satisfying to work with people so involved in the health of the club."</p>
<p>Talbot also will continue to play events on the Quebec PGA Tour, representing the club, as well as participate in corporate outings.</p>
<p>From the Tour: The second of four consecutive Canadian Tour events being held in Mexico will go ahead as planned despite travel advisories by both the U.S. and Canadian government that people avoid non-essential travel because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The Tour's San Luis Potosi Open, a 72-hole, $125,000 U.S. event, starts today at the Nicklaus La Loma GC. San Luis Potosi is located 418 kilometres north of Mexico City.</p>
<p>Tour officials say they will closely monitor the situation in Mexico with health officials and take every precaution to protect the health of its players and staff. The course will be closed to the general public with no fans or local caddies permitted to attend the tournament.</p>
<p>"While we have seen 10 to 15 players withdraw, our players are all independent contractors and many are still arriving from Latin America, the United States and Canada, all eager to play," said Canadian Tour commissioner Richard Janes, who was in Mexico all last week for the tour's Corona Mazatlan Mexican PGA Championship.</p>
<p>On a personal note: Australian Stuart Appleby, in his 14th season on the PGA Tour and an eight-time winner, was raised on a dairy farm and used to hit golf shots from paddock to paddock once his chores were finished.</p>
<p>Appleby, who turns 38 on May 1, also played Australian Rules Football before turning to professional golf in 1992.</p>
<p>He said it: "Everybody knows I need the money and I'm getting life where I can just focus on golf instead of focusing on negative stuff,"Appleby said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Curry willing to play in Mexico, but swine flu trumps golf tours; Kemptville golfer agrees with position of Canadian Tour</b>
</div><div>Gord Holder   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>659 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Lee Curry was prepared to stay in Mexico to play golf, but the tour pro from Kemptville also says that the Canadian Tour officials got it right when they postponed the last remaining Mexican stop on the 2009 schedule because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"You couldn't have faulted them if they had cancelled it right away, that's for sure," Curry, 30, said Wednesday from his hotel room in San Luis Potosi, about a two-hour drive northwest of Mexico City.</p>
<p>"I think a lot of people were saying, 'Why are they going ahead with it?'"</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, after conducting a 10-team pro-am event earlier that day, the Canadian Tour announced the San Luis Potosi Open would proceed as scheduled from today through Sunday.</p>
<p>However, spectators and local caddies would have to be banned, and tournaments in the next two weeks held at Yucatan and Riviera Maya were postponed until later in 2009.</p>
<p>The Nationwide Tour also announced Wednesday that it was postponing the Mexico Open, which was slated to run from May 18 to 24 at the El Bosque Golf Club in Leon, Guanajuato.</p>
<p>The first of four Mexican tournaments on the Canadian Tour, the Corona Mazatlan Classic Mexican PGA Championship, took place last week at Mazatlan. Argentina's Mauricio Molina won the title in a playoff.</p>
<p>Curry, in his first Canadian Tour start of the year after playing on the U.S.-based Nationwide Tour in 2008, had a bout with food poisoning early in the week, but recovered and finished in a tie for 25th.</p>
<p>"If it had happened to me this week, I would have freaked out pretty good," he said.</p>
<p>Despite that incident, Curry said that he would have been willing to stay.</p>
<p>Only employees and those connected with the golf tournament were allowed at San Luis Potosi Resort. Canadian Tour representatives instructed players to avoid going into the city and to take all meals either at their hotels or La Loma Golf Club, and there was to have been bottled water and hand sanitizers on every hole.</p>
<p>Curry was seven holes into a practice round Wednesday morning when a rules official told him the tournament was postponed. He and hotel roommates Dale and Ryan Vallely of Medicine Hat, Alta., were to fly to Cancun on Wednesday night, spend the night there and then fly home to Canada.</p>
<p>Curry said there was talk that San Luis Potosi's airport might be shut down today.</p>
<p>Canadian airlines have announced they will waive change fees for passengers from Mexico, but Curry said that would only have covered flights departing by May 15, and his return was originally scheduled for May 18, following the last Mexican tournament.</p>
<p>However, he spoke to an airline supervisor who waived the fee so Curry could fly back today at no extra cost.</p>
<p>About 20 golfers, mostly from Canada and the United States, withdrew before the postponement was announced Wednesday, though Curry said online news reports and Canadian Tour officials, after speaking with the Canadian consulate, suggested many flu victims had been slow to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>"There were a couple of guys who flew in just to play this week, but most of the guys were already here," he said.</p>
<p>Curry said it appeared most likely that the postponed Mexican tournaments would be rescheduled for September or October, following the cross-Canada leg of the schedule, which resumes with the Times-Colonist Open in Victoria on June 4-7.</p>
<p>If that happens, it won't have a major impact on the players' 2009 season, though the postponements have created an unexpected five-week break.</p>
<p>Curry said he would probably try to play events on the Carolina-based Tar Heel Tour, with other Canadian Tour members seeking out similar playing opportunities.</p>

<p>Ontario health officials say all suspected swine flu cases in the capital region have come back negative, but many Ottawa residents are playing it safe.</p>
<p>"As far as we know, all results have been reported," said Dr. Vivek Goel, president of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>Those negative cases include that of Marc Dazé, 37, who returned from Mexico with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>He made his case public after becoming frustrated with what he felt was an unreasonable delay in returning test results.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, he said he was told local public health officials "made a special request to the lab for my results."</p>
<p>It took six days for the results, twice as long as the provincial average.</p>
<p>Dazé, who was struck with a flu and respiratory problems on the final day of his honeymoon in Cancun last week, said he was relieved.</p>
<p>"Man, what a nerve-racking experience," he said. "Still sick, of course, but life is back to somewhat normal."</p>
<p>Goel also officially confirmed that Cornwall Crown attorney Guy Simard, who returned from Mexico in March with a mysterious illness, also tested negative for swine flu.</p>
<p>As fears of a pandemic escalate, so are sales of hand sanitizers and masks at Ottawa pharmacies.</p>
<p>Heidi Gabriel, owner and pharmacist of Centrepointe Gabriel Drugs, says customers cleaned out her facemask supply over the past few days. And receiving new product will prove difficult considering their "warehouse has been depleted."</p>
<p>She says customers are also scooping up antiviral drugs like Tamiflu as a precautionary measure; with many asking their doctors for prescriptions.</p>
<p>"It is the same medication that was used to treat the bird flu a few years back," Gabriel said. "So some people have panicked and have asked their doctors to prescribe it for them."</p>

</p>
<p>The number of cases of swine flu in Ontario rose to seven Wednesday, bringing the number of Canadian cases to 19 in four provinces.</p>
<p>Ontario health officials, who confirmed three new cases of the illness, still do not know if one of the seven had travelled to Mexico, they said, raising the possibility the illness has spread within the province.</p>
<p>"I would not rule it out," said Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The new flu strain has spread from person to person in New York and Nova Scotia, officials said.</p>
<p>British Columbia also added three confirmed cases to its tally Wednesday, all mild. The other cases are in Alberta and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>In the case of the Ontario patient whose travel history is still unknown, officials say doctors may have simply taken inadequate notes.</p>
<p>"The physician may have asked the question and didn't check it off or note it on the lab slip," Williams said. "I'm hoping to get that fairly soon."</p>
<p>If swine flu is spreading here, Williams said, "It does not seem to be a very rapid spread."</p>
<p>"It doesn't seem to have a high communicability," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Vivek Goel, who heads the province's Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said the outbreak is still causing concern among officials.</p>
<p>"It's a new strain (and) there's no immunity to it," he said. "So if it does continue to spread, it will spread to a lot of people. It will evolve and then, if it is like 1918, it could go away for the summer and then come back."</p>
<p>All seven swine flu cases in Ontario -- including the three new ones -- involve people in their 20s. Officials have been tight-lipped, however, about specifics.</p>
<p>The news comes as world health officials raised the level of pandemic alert to five, one short of a full-blown pandemic. Level 5 indicates widespread human infection by the virus.</p>
<p>Canadian health officials said the alert doesn't fundamentally change Ottawa's course of action in responding to the outbreak, which has infected Canadians in four different provinces.</p>
<p>"Regardless of (at) what level the World Health Organization decides to set its alert, I want to reassure Canadians that our government is prepared to deal with this situation head on," Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said at a daily news briefing.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones added Canada is already operating at an escalated alert level because of the cases that have been confirmed here.</p>
<p>The first ones were confirmed on Sunday.</p>
<p>"If this continues and WHO goes to level 6, basically for us, we're functioning in that way now," he said. "Whether it's four or five or six, that's just a number. It's our planning, preparation and response that really count."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Concerns raised over first line of flu defence; Antiviral medication Tamiflu ineffective against other H1N1 virus</b>
</div><div>Mohammed Adam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1087 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>With the declaration of a worldwide swine flu pandemic near, serious questions are being raised about the effectiveness of Tamiflu, the drug that is widely considered the first line of defence against a deadly virus.</p>
<p>The WHO has raised its pandemic alert level to five, meaning a global outbreak is now imminent and mitigation measures must be finalized. But because an effective vaccine for the deadly swine flu that has claimed 160 lives is likely to take three to six months, the first line of defence would be antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza.</p>
<p>Canada has stocked 50 million doses of antiviral drugs and Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the Public Health Agency of Canada, says the country has sufficient stocks of Tamiflu "to treat those who require treatment up until when we get a vaccine."</p>
<p>Ottawa's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, says the drug will be a key part of the city's arsenal in a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>But recent laboratory tests, including some by the National Microbiology Laboratory, show that Tamiflu is not effective against the H1N1 virus that causes the common flu. These results raise a troubling question: If Tamiflu didn't work against the common Type A/H1N1 flu virus, will it be an effective against the new H1N1 virus that causes the Mexican variant of swine flu?</p>
<p>Some experts believe it may not and say the faith governments have placed in Tamiflu may be misplaced.</p>
<p>"National governments are placing multibillion orders for stockpiles of Roche's Tamiflu" but there is "no guarantee as yet that Tamiflu will prove effective against a pandemic strain," said a 2005 report by Informa Healthcare, a leading British-based pharmaceutical research, publishing and consulting group.</p>
<p>The doubts about Tamiflu were strengthened this flu season when tests showed that the drug was ineffective against most of the common flu viruses.</p>
<p>Canada's top lab in Winnipeg tested 225 A/H1N1 influenza "isolates" for Tamiflu resistance and all of them were resistant to the drug because of the virus's capacity to mutate. Tests in British Columbia also showed the A/H1N1 flu was resistant to Tamiflu. Tests in the U.S. have also come to similar conclusions.</p>
<p>Levy acknowledges that Tamiflu has not been effective this flu season and doctors have used alternative drugs to treat patients. But he says that doesn't necessarily mean the drug won't be effective against the "novel" flu virus.</p>
<p>"We've been cognizant that Tamiflu is not what the scientists have been recommending as the first line (of defence) for seasonal flu. We know from laboratory testing we've been doing over the last few months that many of the viruses we've been able to isolate for seasonal flu are resistant to Tamiflu," he said.</p>
<p>And that's why some people are saying, "Well, hang up a minute, the study says this virus is resistant to Tamiflu so why use it." Even more difficult for physicians in the treatment of patients is that when someone first shows up with symptoms, it's unclear immediately what flu strain they have.</p>
<p>But Levy says evidence gathered so far shows that the new flu is "susceptible" to Tamiflu.</p>
<p>"The fact that one H1N1 virus is resistant doesn't suggest a new H1N1 virus is going to be resistant," he said. "All the reports I've read so far coming out of the National Microbiology Laboratory is that the new flu is susceptible to Tamiflu."</p>
<p>What public health officials are worried about is not that Tamiflu will not work; rather, Levy says, overuse of the drug could compromise its effectiveness. Because flu viruses mutate rapidly, unnecessary use of Tamiflu could render it useless because the new virus could mutate and become resistant.</p>
<p>"If we overuse one of these agents (anti-viral drugs), if we use too much too quickly in the wrong situation, we run the risk of creating a situation where it will be resistant," he said. "And then six months down the road, when we get a worse situation, the agent would no longer be effective."</p>
<p>Dr. Brian Ward, associate director of the Research Institute at the McGill University Health Centre, said the common H1N1 flu virus and the new swine flu virus are "distant cousins" and there is little reason to believe that if one becomes resistant, the other one would also be. He agreed that the real danger of a drug like Tamiflu becoming ineffective is overuse.</p>
<p>"The only reason we should be worried is that one Canadian might be infected by both the seasonal and new flu virus, but that is remote," said Ward, an expert on viruses and vaccines.</p>
<p>Samantha Ouimet, spokeswoman for Roche Canada, the manufacturer of Tamiflu, said the drug did not work against the seasonal flu, but said the WHO and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended its use against swine flu.</p>
<p>"There was resistance to Tamiflu this flu season, but both the WHO and the CDC say it is active against the new flu strain," Ouimet said.</p>
<p>In a statement, Roche said the company is working closely with the federal government to meet any additional need for Tamiflu. Roche said the company wants to meet the needs of public health before it considers commercial clients.</p>

<p>What it means: Human-to-human spread of the virus in at least two countries in one WHO region. Indicates that a pandemic is imminent.</p>

</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO and GLORIA GALLOWAY   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO and OTTAWA --</p>
<p>Global health authorities stressed there is no evidence to suggest they should raise the pandemic flu alert from phase 5 to the highest level of phase 6, even as the number of swine flu cases around the world continues to increase.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised the level on its six-rung pandemic alert scale twice this week, but it stopped short of declaring the swine outbreak a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>“As of today, that assessment holds steady and we do not have evidence to suggest that we should move to phase 6 today or any such move is imminent right now,” Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's acting assistant director-general for health security and environment, said today in a conference call from Geneva.</p>
<p>The WHO on Wednesday raised the alert level to phase 5, meaning there has been sustained human-to-human transmission in at least two countries in a WHO region – both Mexico and the United States – and there are strong signals that a worldwide outbreak is about to occur.</p>
<p>The number of lab-confirmed swine flu cases increased to 236 today, up from 148 the previous day. Ninety-seven of the cases are from Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak. There have been seven confirmed swine flu deaths in Mexico, and one in the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Fukuda said the WHO has tapped into its stockpile of anti-viral drugs and has begun distributing it to developing countries and Mexico. Early tests have shown that the virus is sensitive to anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu. Canada has sufficient stockpiles of anti-virals.</p>
<p>Roche, the manufacturer of the anti-virals, has indicated to the WHO that it is scaling up production of Tamiflu, Dr. Fukuda said.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is a new disease and human beings have not yet developed immunity. Some countries, including Canada, have started work on a vaccine.</p>
<p>The number of confirmed swine flu cases in Canada climbed to 34 today with five new confirmations in British Columbia and Quebec's first confirmed case.</p>
<p>Quebec health officials say the person from the Montreal area was in Mexico recently and is now at home with a mild case of the flu.</p>
<p>Fifteen new cases have been reported in Canada today — five in B.C., four in Alberta, four in Nova Scotia, one in Ontario and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>They are all considered mild.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, says the virus will no longer be referred to as swine flu, but instead will be called the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Prime Minister Stephen Harper referred to the outbreak as the Mexican flu as governments around the world grapple with the nomenclature for what may be an emerging pandemic.</p>
<p>In Mexico, where there have been 168 deaths, not all linked to the new virus, citizens have been urged to stay home for five days. Authorities are also shutting down non-essential government services from Friday through Tuesday in hopes of containing the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>“There is no safer place to protect yourself against catching swine flu than in your house,” Mexican President Felipe Calderon said in a televised address Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The virus continues to move from one country to the next. Switzerland and the Netherlands became the latest countries to report swine flu infections.</p>
<p>The Swiss government said a 19-year-old student with swine flu was mistakenly released from the hospital and then hastily re-admitted. The Dutch said a three-year-old child who recently returned from Mexico had contracted swine flu and was being treated and recovering well.</p>
<p>European Union health ministers planned emergency talks in Luxembourg to co-ordinate national efforts in preventing the spread of swine flu in Europe.</p>
<p>By raising the pandemic alert level, the WHO has sent a signal to countries to activate their pandemic preparedness plans, and remain on high alert for unusual outbreaks of influenza-like illness and severe pneumonia. Many countries had already built pandemic plans because of fears surrounding avian flu in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>Canadian authorities say the country's pandemic plan is already in effect. It includes, among other things, vaccine production, an anti-viral stockpile, and a citizen-readiness campaign for each phase of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Richard Besser, the acting director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta, said the swine flu situation in his country is evolving rapidly.</p>
<p>“As you know, last night the World Health Organization raised the threat level to five,” Dr. Besser said in a conference call. “It's really a wake-up call to the rest of the global community that, if you haven't been paying attention to what's going on here and in Mexico, it's time to pull out your pandemic plans and think about what you would be doing if this infection were occurring within your own borders.”</p>
<p>The Unity States now has 109 confirmed cases in 11 states. But Dr. Besser said the large number of suspected but unconfirmed cases render those statistics “murky.” The median age of infected Americans is 16 years old.</p>
<p>Different states are adopting different strategies – jurisdictions have been quicker to close schools than others, for instance – and that “is a good thing,” said Dr. Besser, because it will allow health officials to compare responses and determine what works best.</p>
<p>Canada received 20 suspected virus samples from Mexico this week for testing. But Dr. Besser said there is now a lab operating in Mexico that is capable of doing its own diagnosis and confirmation of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The efforts to produce a vaccine continue, he said, and the aim is to have a drug that is available for use by the fall.</p>
<p>There has been much discussion around how easily the virus can be transmitted person to person.</p>
<p>U.S. Vice President Joe Biden was criticized Thursday for saying he would advise his family to stay off airplanes and subways because of the swine flu. Dr. Besser said he would not avoid plane travel unless he was sick.</p>
<p>But people have become infected by strangers in a public setting, he said.</p>
<p>“We definitely have cases occurring in many states that aren't related to other clusters,” said Dr. Besser. “How casual the contact was, I don't think we have information on that. But our experience with the influenza virus in particular is that it's a virus that spreads pretty easily person to person. So it doesn't require, as a virus, that you have to have close personal contact to acquire it.”</p>

<p>HALIFAX and EDMONTON --</p>
<p>The number of confirmed swine flu cases in Canada climbed to 27 today as Alberta and Nova Scotia announced eight new cases of the virus, although all are said to be mild.</p>
<p>Four new cases have been confirmed at King's-Edgehill school in small-town Nova Scotia, bringing the total there to eight, while four new cases have been confirmed in Calgary.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Strang, the Nova Scotia's chief public health officer, said the new cases were not a surprise.</p>
<p>"We expected to see new cases and we anticipate more in the coming days," he told a briefing Thursday. "This is a constantly evolving situation and the important thing is for people to be aware of the situation and take the necessary precautions."</p>
<p>About two dozen students from the prestigious private boarding school in Windsor, 45 minutes north of Halifax, were on a school trip to Mexico early this month.</p>
<p>Andre Corriveau, Alberta's Chief Medical Officer of Health, told reporters Thursday in Edmonton that officials have found four new cases of swine flu in Calgary – one female and three males, all young adults. The four people had been travelling together in Mexico and recently returned home.</p>
<p>That brings Alberta's total swine flu cases to six. According to health officials, all of the cases have been mild and none of the patients have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>Dr. Corriveau said that as more Albertans continue to return from Mexico, he “expects to see more cases.”</p>
<p>However, Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert said there is still no need to raise undue alarm.</p>
<p>“At this stage, there are no plans to do anything differently,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Liepert said recent decisions by two Edmonton school boards to cancel field trips outside of Alberta may have been “premature.”</p>
<p>“Take precautions but let's not overreact,” he said.</p>

<p>The Better Business Bureau is warning consumers to be on the lookout for fraudulent e-mails and websites trying to take advantage of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"Scammers read newspapers, watch TV and surf the Internet, and they know that by using a hook from the day's top headlines that they'll be able to catch lots of fish," said Rosalind Scott of the Vancouver Island Better Business Bureau.</p>
<p>According to McAfee Avert Labs, an online security company, spammers began pumping out e-mails as soon as the first accounts of swine flu were being reported in the news, accounting for two per cent of all spam messages. The messages include such subject lines as "Madonna caught swine flu" and "Swine flu in Hollywood." The company reports that the e-mails often link to online pharmacies.</p>
<p>According to online security company <span class="companylink">F-Secure Corp</span>., more than 250 websites with the term swine flu were registered in the first few days following the announcement of the outbreak. The company says scammers are preparing to use the sites in a variety of online scams. One site is already selling a Swine Flu Survival Guide PDF for $19.95.</p>
<p>BBB offers the following advice to avoid scams:</p>
<p>- Avoid opening e-mail from an unknown source and do not click on any links in the body of the e-mail or open any attachments. Instead, delete the e-mail or report it to the Federal Trade Commission by forwarding the e-mail to spam@uce.gov.</p>
<p>- Don't believe online offers for vaccinations against swine flu; a vaccine does not exist. For information, go to www. nml-lnm.gc.ca/index-eng.htm</p>
<p>- Make sure your anti-virus and anti-spyware software is up to date and operating-system security patches have been installed.</p>

<p>Capital region residents are not flooding into emergency departments to check whether that cough and sniffle is really swine flu.</p>
<p>Emergency departments in Victoria were crowded yesterday, but not overwhelmed, said Shannon Marshall, Vancouver Island Health Authority spokeswoman.</p>
<p>"People are not flooding in with colds. We may be experiencing a little bit heavier volume, but nothing that affects our daily census," she said, warning people not to visit the emergency department unless they're in severe respiratory distress.</p>
<p>Health authorities throughout B.C. are updating pandemic plans as they brace for a possible onslaught of swine flu.</p>
<p>The VIHA plan, written in April 2006 in response to avian flu, spells out everything from the number of respirators needed to which gathering places should be shut down first if the city is gripped by a pandemic flu: schools and daycares first, with restaurants and shopping malls at the bottom of the list.</p>
<p>The plan estimates that a pandemic flu would mean 400,000 people clinically ill on Vancouver Island, with 48,000 to 100,900 needing outpatient care and 400 to 3,200 needing hospitalization.</p>
<p>Between 160 and 1,200 people would die and health costs would be $24 million to $54 million, with another $217 million to $428 million in indirect societal costs.</p>
<p>Staffing shortages are anticipated as doctors, nurses and caregivers become ill or stay home to care for sick family members, and the plan raises the possibility of using volunteers to fill in.</p>
<p>Handwashing has sprung to the top of the agenda in workplaces around Greater Victoria. VIHA chief medical health officer Richard Stanwick insists that soap and water, not masks, are the best defence against swine flu.</p>
<p>At the Capital Regional District office building on Fisgard Street, hand sanitizers have been ordered for public areas, such as beside elevators.</p>
<p>"We will have them installed fairly quickly," said Chris Neilson, senior manager of human resources.</p>
<p>The CRD, which has 450 regular staff and about 250 auxiliaries, already emphasizes that people need to regularly wash their hands, he said.</p>
<p>"We are also ensuring that, when people are not feeling well, they go home," Neilson said.</p>
<p>Esquimalt-Juan de Fuca Liberal MP Keith Martin, who is also a doctor, cautioned against panicking, however.</p>
<p>"It's important to be vigilant and not panic. We have an excellent surveillance system across the country," he said.</p>
<p>"It's not the end of the world."</p>
<p>The influenza A virus has a habit of "reproducing sloppily," meaning it drops and picks up genes and exhibits behaviour changes that can make it more or less virulent, Martin said.</p>
<p>That's why health officials will be watching carefully to see if it becomes more difficult to manage, he said.</p>
<p>An influenza pandemic occurs when a virus radically changes, meaning people have little or no immunity.</p>
<p>Pandemics have been recorded every 10 to 40 years dating back to the 1600s, says the Ministry of Health Services website.</p>
<p>In 1918/1919, more than 20 million people died of the Spanish flu.</p>
<p>The last pandemic, the Hong Kong flu, occurred in 1968, when about 700,000 people died.</p>

<p>The swine flu has put a real bug into a Victoria couple's wedding plans next month.</p>
<p>Mike Goorevitch and Nicole Smith had a dream wedding arranged for May 15 on the beautiful shores of the Mayan Riviera in Mexico.</p>
<p>A beach wedding. Dinner. A mariachi band. Dancing. Free massages and a champagne breakfast.</p>
<p>"It was Nicole's dream to have a destination wedding. I wanted to give it to her. It's the biggest day of her life," Goorevitch said yesterday.</p>
<p>They invited 17 friends, who prepaid a total of $28,000 to Sunwing Vacations.</p>
<p>But their problems began on Tuesday, when Sunwing's flights to Mexico were cancelled after the outbreak of swine flu. The Canadian government has issued an advisory warning travellers to stay away from Mexico.</p>
<p>Goorevitch doesn't blame the airlines for cancelling flights.</p>
<p>"We are as concerned about the flu as anybody else," he said.</p>
<p>But he said Sunwing will not issue a full refund so alternative arrangements can be made.</p>
<p>Sunwing representatives said they couldn't comment until learning full details of the couple's arrangements.</p>
<p>The company has offered to rebook flights until Oct. 31 to other destinations, including Cuba and Las Vegas.</p>
<p>A trip to the Dominican Republic was also offered, but Goorevitch said it poses problems because the originating flight leaves from Toronto.</p>
<p>Most wedding guests are from Western Canada and would need to pay an additional $8,000 for connecting flights on short notice.</p>
<p>Another problem is that a legal marriage couldn't be arranged at short notice in the Dominican Republic.</p>
<p>"We're stuck. For all intents and purposes, our wedding has been cancelled by Sunwing.</p>
<p>"It's ridiculous they're holding us hostage," said Goorevitch. "Sunwing should be giving everybody their money back."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doubt cast on Mexican flu toll; WHO raises alert; Virus not to blame in all cases: analysis</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>955 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its alert system to a step away from full-blown pandemic level yesterday, though new evidence circulating among scientists suggests that far fewer people have died from the swine flu in Mexico than thought.</p>
<p>WHO officials said a pandemic is now inevitable, and urged countries to go on high alert against the new H1N1 virus, saying the bug's spread will affect "all humanity."</p>
<p>Yet an in-depth analysis of some of the 150 or so Mexican deaths linked to the flu found that few were actually caused by the new flu bug, suggesting a relatively modest fatality toll, said a well-placed Canadian infectious-disease expert.</p>
<p>The number of Canadian cases, meanwhile, jumped to 19 with three more each in B. C. and Ontario. Like the Canadian patients identified earlier, they were all described as having relatively mild infections.</p>
<p>Canadaearnedinternational praise at the same time for the scientific support it has lent to the WHO and Mexico, including agreeing to test yesterday a rush shipment of 200 Mexican blood samples at microbiology labs in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>In Geneva, Dr. Margaret Chan, director-general of the UN agency, said she had decided to move the pandemic alert scale to phase five, while another WHO official said a pandemic is now inevitable.</p>
<p>Dr. Chan urged that the world work together to fight the virus, with affluent nations donating anti-viral medication to developing countries, which she said are always hit the hardest by such diseases.</p>
<p>"Influenza pandemics must be taken seriously precisely because of their capacity to spread rapidly to every country in the world," said the Canadian-educated official.</p>
<p>"This is an opportunity for global solidarity as we look for responses and solutions.... It really is all of humanity that is under threat during a pandemic."</p>
<p>Pandemic phase five denotes a novel virus that has shown sustained transmission between humans in at least two countries of a particular region -- Mexico and the United States in this case.</p>
<p>Level six -- the pandemic phase -- involves such transmission in at least one additional country in another region.</p>
<p>Dr. Chan, though, said the most important unanswered question about the virus -- a combination of pig, bird and human flu genetics -- was how severely it will affect people.</p>
<p>The close to 1,900 cases and 150 or more deaths linked by Mexico to the microbe have inspired much fear. But pathologists and other scientists are now thoroughly investigating those deaths through autopsies and tests, and uncovering a different picture.</p>
<p>Dr. Gerald Evans, head of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada and a member of a federal pandemic-planning committee, said he was told that of about 25 "highly suspicious" deaths investigated, only seven were found to be a result of the swine flu. "There was a lot of speculation and what seemed to be evidence there were dozens and dozens of deaths. Careful analysis showed these people likely died of something else, and not flu," he said.</p>
<p>"That's really good news, and that would fit with what we've seen outside of Mexico."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are still only 26 lab-confirmed cases in Mexico. Dr. Todd Hatchett, a microbiologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax who also advises the federal government on pandemic planning, said he, too, had heard that the Mexican death toll is being downgraded under further investigation.</p>
<p>Based on what is known about the new swine flu, it could either fizzle out totally, become more adaptable to transmission among humans yet less virulent, or become more adaptable and more dangerous, he said. Many experts, though, are speculating that the new flu, even if it triggers a pandemic, will be no more serious than a regular seasonal strain, which can still cause as many as 4,000 deaths a year in Canada, mostly among the elderly, very young and immune compromised. "A pandemic relates more to geography ... not severity," noted Dr. Lynora Saxinger, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Alberta Hospital.</p>
<p>Still, while the new flu might not be any more virulent or deadly than a regular seasonal variety, many more people could end up being infected because most have no immunity to it, said Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the Public Health Agency of Canada. He said his organization is already operating as if in pandemic mode, since Canada is among the nine countries with cases.</p>
<p>Dr. Chan, meanwhile, specifically praised work done by both Canada and the U. S. Centers for Disease Control in helping the WHO and Mexico. Yesterday, 200 samples from Mexico were flown in for testing at the public health agency's Winnipeg lab, after a request last night from the Mexican health minister. Mexico has no ability to conduct such tests itself.</p>
<p>Canada is also at the forefront of efforts to produce a vaccine, with the Winnipeg labs trying to develop a "seed virus" that could be used as the basis for a vaccine, Dr. Butler-Jones said. Such an immune agent will likely not be available, though, for four to six months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Dr. Butler-Jones urged that ordinary Canadians avoid wearing masks to ward off the virus, saying they can cause a false sense of security.</p>

</div><div>National Post</div>
<div>716 words</div><div>30 April 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The outbreak of a new strain of swine-originated H1N1 influenza virus is a frightening phenomenon. But the rapid response to the outbreak also shows how far the world has come since the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic killed up to 100 million people.</p>
<p>The death toll in the current outbreak stands at somewhere between eight and 153 -- depending on how reliable Mexico's original data reports are taken to be. While no one knows how many people ultimately will die before the outbreak runs its course, we suspect the tally will be at least one -- and possibly two -- orders of magnitude lower than the 250,000-to-500,000 global deaths caused every year by garden-variety flu infections.</p>
<p>The very fact that doctors and health regulators are already talking in an educated way about swine flu is itself a miracle of modern epidemiology and information technology. As we write this, on April 29, a mere 27 days have passed since the first confirmed patient -- five-year-old Edgar Enrique Hernandez of La Gloria, Mexico -- got sick on April 2. Two weeks after that, samples were already on their way to the U. S. Centers for Disease Control, which promptly released full genomic sequences through the Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Influenza Data. Already, we know that the swine flu is susceptible to at least two anti-viral medications -- Tamiflu and Relenza. In fact, one commercial pharma company says it may have a vaccine out as soon as this summer.</p>
<p>The collection of such an enormous amount of information -- and its instant spread to every government and health system on Earth -- would have been unimaginable even a generation ago, let alone in the time of the First World War. Already, lives are being saved as a result: From Mexico to New Zealand, public health officials are on guard for every instance of the disease.</p>
<p>It is too late for the flu to be contained to its source region, World Health Organization experts believe. But unless the new flu strain turns out to be easily communicable through airborne contamination -- which seems unlikely given that even the town of La Gloria itself is no longer seeing fresh cases -- it should be possible to suppress local outbreaks.</p>
<p>How? Like all diseases, the new H1N1 strain -- a piggy-brewed mix of avian, human and porcine flu varieties -- breeds on filth: The town of La Gloria is home to a massive pig farming operation whose charming infrastructure includes acres of manure lagoons. (No one knows for sure how the disease made the jump to little Edgar, but a good guess is that it involved the feces-feasting flies that swarm the very inaptly named Mexican town.) Slowing the disease's spread, therefore, means obeying the common-sense rules of infection-control we all learned from our mothers when we were four: washing our hands, covering our faces when we sneeze and generally avoiding unnecessary contact between fingers and eyes, noses and mouths.</p>
<p>When it comes to avoiding epidemics, small measures, it should be noted, can have an enormous effect: Like many non-linear dynamical systems, disease outbreaks are extremely sensitive to small changes in governing parameters. Hygiene measures that lessen the likelihood of a disease being spread from individual to individual by even a small amount can have a massive effect on the overall outbreak pattern when iterated over multiple contagion cycles.</p>
<p>Canada circa 2009, moreover, is starting from a gratifyingly germ-o-phobic baseline: Our society has come a long way since the era of our grandparents, who lived at a time when the germ theory of disease, though understood on paper, was ignored in practice. Hospitals of the era were filthy by modern standards, as were schools and restaurants. Even urban homes, which typically contained many more children in much smaller spaces, tended to be squalid breeding grounds for deadly pathogens.</p>
<p>Sadly, many developing nations still answer to this latter description, which is why swine flu may claim many thousands of lives overseas. But here in Canada, there is no reason for panic. By obeying the basic laws of hygiene, and being vigilant for signs of infection, our society should weather this outbreak with a minimum of death and disruption.</p>

<p>The United Nations agency that guards the health of humanity moved one step closer to declaring a full-blown pandemic yesterday as swine flu continued its spread in Canada and around the world, claiming its first life outside embattled Mexico's borders.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization increased its alert level to Phase 5, one tier below that of pandemic, as the caseload in the United States jumped to nearly 100 -- including the death of a Mexican toddler in Texas -- and Ontario and B.C. each reported three new cases.</p>
<p>"All countries should immediately now activate their pandemic preparedness plans; countries should remain on high alert,'' WHO director-general Dr. Margaret Chan said from Geneva in a chilling call to arms to governments and agencies around the world.</p>
<p>"This change to a higher phase of alert is a signal . . . that certain actions now should be undertaken with increased urgency and at an accelerated pace.''</p>
<p>Phase 5 of the WHO's six-tiered alert system, with Phase 6 representing a full-blown pandemic, indicates human-to-human spread of the virus into at least two countries in one WHO region, according to the organization's alert system.</p>
<p>Phase 5 "is a strong signal that a pandemic is imminent and that the time to finalize the organization, communication, and implementation of the planned mitigation measures is short.''</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief medical officer of health, acknowledged the alarming tone of Chan's announcement, but reassured Canadians that health authorities in their country have a plan in place and that it's being followed.</p>
<p>"I'm sure many people will be anxious upon hearing this; however, for Canada it does not mean a change in what we are facing and how we approach it,'' Butler-Jones said. "As we continue our surveillance, we will find more and more cases, and as for any form of influenza, some will be more severe, and unfortunately we may see some deaths as well.''</p>
<p>A Mexican toddler who died in a Houston hospital after falling ill during a visit to Texas became the first to die from the swine flu outside Mexico, prompting U.S. President Barack Obama -- marking his 100th day in office yesterday -- to offer his "thoughts and prayers'' to the boy's family.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a serious situation,'' and "we are closely and continuously monitoring'' it, Obama said of the spreading illness.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the number of confirmed cases swelled to nearly 100, in 10 states stretching from coast to coast. A marine in Southern California was identified as a possible case; 39 others were confined to their base, pending test results.</p>
<p>Six more confirmed cases brought the Canadian total to 19 -- four in Nova Scotia, seven in Ontario, six in British Columbia and two in Alberta. Germany and Austria became the latest European countries hit by the disease. Britain closed a school after a 12-year-old girl tested positive.</p>
<p>In those parts of the world where the virus had yet to materialize, misinformation appeared to be following an equally virulent path.</p>
<p>Egypt ordered the slaughter of every pig in the country and Gabon became the latest country to ban pork imports, despite persistent assurances from all quarters that swine flu cannot be contracted from eating pork products.</p>
<p>Egypt's overwhelmingly Muslim population does not eat pork, but farmers raise some 300,000 to 350,000 pigs for the Christian minority. Those farmers will still be allowed to sell the meat from the slaughtered animals.</p>
<p>Cuba eased its flight ban, deciding just to block flights coming in from Mexico. And Asian countries greeted returning travellers with teams of medical workers and carts of disinfectants, eager to keep swine flu from infecting their continent.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Better days for Maple Leaf</b>
</div><div>David Friend   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods Inc</span>. (TSX:MFI) chief executive Michael McCain says that consumer misconceptions about the swine flu probably won't hurt the food processor's meat business, even if countries around the world start to ban imports of pork products.</p>
<p>McCain said yesterday that Maple Leaf might even see an increased demand for the company's pork, especially if Mexican pork exports are banned in some countries.</p>
<p>"Certainly if Mexican pork exports are impacted negatively, it would tend to help Canadian pork exports,'' he said in an interview with The Canadian Press after Maple Leaf reported the company's first-quarter earnings and held its annual meeting.</p>
<p>But McCain added that it's still too early to determine whether Maple Leaf will see any impact from the swine flu, and that pork exports are only a minimal part of the business.</p>
<p>He said that historically the company has exported 20 to 30 per cent of its pork, but that it's "less than that'' these days, though he declined to give specifics.</p>
<p>The Canadian pork industry has been plagued by uncertainty this week over fears that misinformation about the swine flu could cause a drastic decline in demand for raw pork or meat products such as bacon and ham.</p>
<p>There is no scientific evidence that swine flu is transmitted through eating pork products. However, countries around the world have been taking precautions. Reports say pigs are being killed en masse in Egypt. The Lebanese government banned the import of pigs and raw uncooked pork.</p>
<p>The swift international response has sent U.S. hog futures prices -- which give a value to the selling price of pigs on the market -- into a downward spiral.</p>
<p>Jacques Pomerleau, executive director of Canada Pork International, said that the domestic pork industry is in limbo as it waits to see how many countries might restrict imports. Half of Canada's pork production is exported.</p>
<p>"The whole thing is completely uncertain,'' said Pomerleau.</p>
<p>International Trade Minister Stockwell Day said the Canadian government is trying to get the message out to international buyers of pork that there's no scientific basis for any ban on meat products.</p>
<p>"These products are safe, and we are maintaining that and we are asking other countries to follow that,'' he said in Montreal.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf was the centre of its own meat scandal last year over an tbreak of listeriosis linked to products produced at one of its plants. Yesterday, the company reported that it pulled itself to profitability in the first quarter, and boosted sales by more than six per cent.</p>
<p>However, the Toronto-based company was still struggling with some of the after-effects of last summer's listeria poisoning.</p>
<p>Maple Leaf reported $2.9 million in profit during the quarter, worth two cents per share, compared with a break-even result a year earlier.</p>
<p>Sales increased 6.3 per cent to $1.28 billion compared to $1.2 billion, mostly on price increases and favourable foreign currency conversions based on its fresh meat sales.</p>
<p>McCain told investors at the company's annual meeting yesterday that the food producer -- which makes processed meats under the Maple Leaf and Schneiders brands and is also Canada's largest bread company -- was making progress toward returning to normalcy.</p>
<p>"Where this could've been a fatal blow for some companies, we've come through this storm with the organizational, reputation and financial strength to rebuild,'' McCain told shareholders.</p>
<p>"Because of last August's tragedy Maple Leaf now owns the listeria issue. We cannot forget that link and we cannot ask Canadians to forget that link.''</p>
<p>The listeria outbreak, traced to cold cuts produced in the company's Toronto plant last summer, killed 22 people, triggering a national scare and a public-relations nightmare for one of Canada's oldest and most identifiable food companies.</p>

</p>
<p>The following editorial appeared first in yesterday's Prince Albert Herald.</p>
<p>A sampling of world and local news outlets would suggest that the swine flu outbreak is a major, world-shaking crisis. That's not entirely surprising, for media outlets tend to focus on promoting hysteria: sick and dying people make for easy news.</p>
<p>But that's only part of the story. Nestled within the storylines of the current outbreak are excellent reminders of how much we as Canadians and a global society have learned and adapted to the threat of disease in the last decade.</p>
<p>In Canada, the April 2003 outbreak of SARS triggered a wealth of changes in the public health system. In direct response to the SARS crisis, the federal government formed the Public Health Agency of Canada. Included in its mandate are plans to deal with outbreaks of infectious diseases just like the one currently attracting global attention. Following on the heels of SARS and the avian flu scare of two years later, provinces and municipalities started planning for worst-case scenarios.</p>
<p>In the private sector, knowledge gained from SARS and avian flu outbreaks has led to the ability to rapidly identify the genome of the current swine flu virus. This, in turn, will allow several groups to work to create a vaccine.</p>
<p>In the interim, a Hong Kong-based team that first developed a test for the SARS virus predicted on Tuesday that they will have a test for the current avian flu strain within a week.</p>
<p>So even as concern grows over the swine flu outbreak, it is well worth noting that we -- as a nation and as a society -- are better prepared to deal with communicable diseases than ever before.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The number of confirmed cases of swine flu in the region stood at zero yesterday afternoon, but medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer is preparing the public for worse news in the days ahead.</p>
<p>"It's just a matter of time before we have our first case," she said yesterday as the number of cases in Canada and other parts of the world grew. "It's very communicable."</p>
<p>Ontario health authorities announced three new cases in the province, bringing the total to seven, all in the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p>Across Canada, the total stood at 19, all relatively mild instances of the flu that has infected hundreds in Mexico, leading to scores of deaths there.</p>
<p>Mercer said Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health and other local health officials are completing pandemic planning in case the situation here gets worse.</p>
<p>She's following several local cases of suspected swine flu, though the results of lab tests aren't yet in.</p>
<p>The people most vulnerable to flu are children under the age of two, the elderly and individuals with underlying medical problems that have already compromised their health.</p>
<p>Mercer recommended people get seasonal flu shots for protection during the current flu season but warned these won't provide protection against this version of swine flu.</p>
<p>Swine flu occasionally jumps the animal barrier to humans and birds, while seasonal human flu circulates among people each year.</p>
<p>Travel advisories continued to seed confusion. While the World Health Organization said Tuesday the risk of an international pandemic was growing, it advised against countries closing borders and restricting travel. The Public Health Agency of Canada, however, recommended postponing non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>With more than 100 confirmed cases in places as far away as the Middle East and Europe, Mercer said travel restrictions are now "a moot point."</p>
<p>History shows unless all travel comes to a halt "it does not work," the doctor said.</p>
<p>Airlines, tour operators and travel agents are working hard to alter plans for the travelling public, steering vacationers away from Mexico, said Guelph-based Sandra Pobega, vice-president of Carleson Wagonlit International Travel Service. Cuba and the Dominican Republic are popular alternatives. Both are also excellent value for budget-minded travellers, she said.</p>
<p>Those going to Mexico on business or to visit family are wise to delay until the swine-flu risk in Mexican outbreak zones is resolved, she added.</p>
<p>"Those just have to wait until things are cleared up."</p>
<p>Pobega welcomed calls from vacationers for up-to-the-minute travel information.</p>
<p>"We don't want people to panic," she said.</p>
<p>While some Mexican cases have been lethal, the confirmed cases in Canada are considered mild.</p>
<p>People are recovering at home, rather than in hospitals, Mercer said. Health investigators haven't yet determined why the Mexican cases appear much more serious than the Canadian ones.</p>
<p>"It's too early to have a strong understanding of this virus's ability to cause disease," Mercer said.</p>
