<p>Diagnosing and treating disease and injury is just one part of a physician's job.</p>
<p>Equally important is spreading the word about the prevention of illness though healthy lifestyles and the avoidance of high-risk behaviour.</p>
<p>Much of it is basic common-sense: don't smoke, keep alcohol consumption down, maintain a healthy weight through sensible eating and regular exercise, and so on.</p>
<p>It's a little trickier when the population faces an unusual health threat like the SARS virus, West Nile virus or the H1N1 influenza virus. Doctors, medical health officers and others must strike a difficult balance, issuing prudent warnings while not panicking the population with dire predictions.</p>
<p>That balance isn't always achieved, as we witnessed earlier this week.</p>
<p>Dr. Khami Chokani, medical health officer for the Prince Albert Parkland Health Region, doubtless had the best of intentions when he spoke out about Saskatchewan's undeniably serious incidence of HIV infection. But issuing a warning of thousands of aboriginal deaths and comparing the province to Sub-Saharan Africa -- where he once worked -- was regrettable and inaccurate.</p>
<p>"If you think decimating the African population was bad . . . HIV in this province will kill 15 to 30 per cent (of the aboriginal population). Not all at one time, but over a five- to 10-year-period," Chokani told the Prince Albert Daily Herald.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the story quickly garnered lurid headlines in other provinces, like "AIDS to decimate Saskatchewan aboriginals: MD" and stating that if Chokani's "worst-case scenario comes to pass, that would equate to roughly 42,500 deaths."</p>
<p>Thankfully, cooler thinking later prevailed, with the province's chief medical health officer, Dr. Moira McKinnon, and Chokani stating that the worst-case outcome was extremely unlikely for a variety of reasons, including better treatment here compared to Africa.</p>
<p>Chokani might have overstated his concern, but the province does have a problem; there were 174 new cases of HIV in 2008, -- up 40 per cent, or 50 cases, from 2007. Prior to 2006, only 20 new cases a year were reported.</p>
<p>Most HIV transmission comes though intravenous drug use, with poor and marginalized aboriginal men and women particularly vulnerable. That still leaves a lot of non-aboriginal people with HIV, too.</p>
<p>Regrettably, repeated warnings about intravenous drug use and promiscuous sex haven't stopped such risky behaviour or stemmed the rise in HIV cases.</p>
<p>At a time when people are focused on the H1N1 virus and its possible impact this winter, it would be a mistake to forget about HIV, or think it's something that only affects a small demographic. Long after H1N1 has faded, HIV will still be around -- an issue that concerns us all.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sask. to plan how to pay doctors in case of outbreak</b>

<p>Saskatchewan health officials will begin discussions next week about compensating physicians who could find themselves on the frontlines in the event of an H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"We will have discussions with the SMA (Saskatchewan Medical Association) around what appropriate compensation is for physicians and how would they be compensated in the event of a pandemic," Brad Havervold, executive director of the province's medical services branch, said in an interview Friday.</p>
<p>Several provinces are grappling with issues surrounding compensation for physicians -- who are mostly self-employed, unlike nurses and others in the health-care system -- as part of pandemic planning.</p>
<p>"If doctors are being asked to do things as part of a pandemic, how are they going to be paid? Are they going to be hourly? Are they going to be fee-for-service? There's some questions around liability and what happens if they're after hours and what happens if they have to go to a different community," said Havervold.</p>
<p>He said the discussions were initiated by the SMA.</p>
<p>Neither the SMA's president nor a spokesperson could be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>The Canadian Federation of Nurses (CFN) came out Friday criticizing provincial plans to pay doctors extra during an H1N1 outbreak. CFN president Linda Silas called it "ridiculous."</p>
<p>News broke earlier this week that the Alberta Medical Association (AMA) is working on a "physician financial support program" in that province with proposed rates of $518.45 an hour for night shifts, $403.24 an hour for evenings and weekends, and $259.23 an hour for weekday shifts. Doctors who don't opt for the hourly rate could be paid on a fee-for-service basis or under a guaranteed salary. The scheme would apply if a public health emergency was declared. The AMA's president Dr. Noel Grisdale has said the pay would guarantee incomes for doctors who leave their medical practice to help out with a crisis and also ensure there are enough physicians available to care for people.</p>
<p>But Silas expressed surprise government and the AMA "would stoop so low in negotiating an outrageous rate in case of a public crisis." She worried Alberta could set the tone for negotiations in other provinces.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan, Havervold said that it's unclear at this point exactly who would qualify for compensation, under what specific circumstances, or at what rate.</p>
<p>"I don't know what the SMA is wanting. They're wanting just to talk about compensation ... At the end of the day, it may be that we end up negotiating some sort of an hourly rate for when they're being asked to do something that's above and beyond what's ordinary in their practice," he said.</p>
<p>In the event of a pandemic, many doctors may continue with their regular practice, but some may be called upon for special duties, explained Havervold.</p>

</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

<p>It's "outrageous" that any Canadian doctors should be negotiating extra fees for treating H1N1 flu patients during a pandemic, says the president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses.</p>
<p>Linda Silas said she was "stunned" to hear doctors in Alberta have negotiated a special payment rate as high as $518 an hour, in the event the provincial government is forced to declare a public health emergency over the flu pandemic. Alberta nurses, who are salaried employees of the health system, will not be offered enhanced payment.</p>
<p>Silas, whose organization represents 158,000 nurses in every province except Quebec, called the plan "utter nonsense.</p>
<p>"It's total craziness. I'm surprised the government and the AMA (Alberta Medical Association) would stoop so low in negotiating an outrageous rate in case of a public crisis," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, nurses are under contract; well, so are doctors. None of them work for free. When we are talking about a public crisis that may happen, we think it's ridiculous."</p>
<p>Saskatchewan may follow Alberta's example. Health officials there will meet next week with the medical community to discuss plans for compensating front-line physicians in the event of an H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Silas said Alberta's approach will set a precedent for other provinces to follow. She said governments should be negotiating how to protect frontline health care workers from infection -- not how much to pay them.</p>

<p>The racers were lined up at the starting pole, and all the famous names were there G:Gordon, Hamlin, Stewart, Busch, the reigning royalty of NASCAR. The crowd was pressed against the fence, sticking together in the 97-degree heat, and the announcer was whipping us up. "Are y'all ready for some racin'?" a young man named Brent Cook shouted, and the kids and the dads and the moms and the grandmas whooped and waved and screamed.</p>
<p>Then a guy came out of a trailer and sprinkled the Grand Prize on a plate and set it down in the sawdust. "The winners get the Cheez Doodles," Mr. Cook said, "and the losers get the crumbs."</p>
<p>This wasn't Daytona or Darlington -- it was the 6 o'clock pig race at the Montgomery County Agricultural Fair.</p>
<p>Located just across the Maryland line from Washington, Montgomery contains some of the most affluent suburbs in America: Chevy Chase, Bethesda, Potomac. It also does not currently have a single elected official from the Republican Party.</p>
<p>Liberal, organic, leafy and rich, Montgomery County (median household income $87,624) voted for Barack Obama over John Mc-Cain last year, 72% to 27%. But now the Maclaren strollers were parked wheel to wheel at the Hogway Speedway and everybody was a-hollerin' for "Piggy Gordon" and "Hammy Hamlin" and "Rutter Busch," which were the names that Mr. Cook and his crew had imposed on their porcine sprinters, even though not many Priuspolishing Marylanders knew the human drivers, uber-celebrities further South, whom they were mocking.</p>
<p>"Soooooo-eeeee!" the suburbanites bellowed, getting into the spirit of the event. And the little pink pigs went trot-trot-trotting around the ring and demolished the tray of Cheez Doodles and wailed for more.</p>
<p>"God bless every one of you," Mr. Cook told the crowd when the race was over and the pigs (and the racing ducks and the baby goats and the Vietnamese potbellies) were back in their pens. "Jesus loves you, and good-night."</p>
<p>I went backstage to talk to Mr. Cook, who is 29 and a lifelong resident of Catawba County, N. C. -- median household income $40,500 -- which preferred John McCain over Barack Obama, 62% to 36%. Mr. Cook is the son of the founder of the Hogway Speedway and he has been pullin' pork from fairground to fairground since 1994. He earns about $30,000 a year, he said, and a man can live rather well on that amount in Catawba County, where Mr. Cook recently bought a house and nine acres of land for $130,000.</p>
<p>Mr. Cook reported that the Great Recession hadn't hurt business at all. (Admission to the pig races is always free; the Cooks get their slice from the fair itself.)</p>
<p>"Twenty minutes of fun," he said. "It takes your mind off the bad stuff."</p>
<p>"When you come up North and look out at the crowd, what do you see?" I asked.</p>
<p>"I see people who don't know that milk comes from a cow," the wrangler smiled.</p>
<p>Here was the Great Divide in American life, reduced to its simplest terms: city-country, fancy-humble, clever-simple, sinful-righteous. This is how North Carolina had split last fall, the urban areas going for Obama, the rural counties for McCain, with the Democrat winning the Tarheel State by 14,000 votes out of more than four million.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of Christians who voted for Obama even though he kills babies," Mr. Cook sighed.</p>
<p>"He might say he's not a Muslim and he may not be one," he went on, "but he's trying to change the United States in ways that a Christian would not do. I still pray for him, though. He is our President. In our Men's Prayer Group on Monday nights, we always pray for him to change."</p>
<p>While we were talking, Mr. Cook's cellphone went off and the ringtone was JasonAldean singing Big Green Tractor, which is about a Montgomery County-type girl --driving her "shiny little Beemer with the rag top down" -- coming out to the farm and mounting her boyfriend's combine. It was the Great Divide in song, and we were seeing the same chasm at those health-care "town halls," those men in ball caps and plaid shirts snortin' and gruntin' at their bewildered congressmen.</p>
<p>It wasn't about health insurance, Mr. Cook and I agreed. It was about honest people -- or people who considered themselves to be honest -- from Montana and New Mexico and Catawba County who were tired of choking on crumbs while Wall Street and Washington hogged all the Cheez Doodles and sent them the bill for another bag. They were just lookin' for a place to squeal.</p>
<p>Mr. Cook did have health insurance; he paid for it himself every month. His pigs had been vaccinated against swine flu. The animal-rights crusaders left the Hogway Speedway alone. And he had seen far more troubled countries than America when he paid his own way each year on missions for Jesus to places like Mozambique. But the Great Divide was deep.</p>
<p>"If I'd be president," he said, "there's so much I'd totally change."</p>
<p>This, was unlikely, however; Mr. Cook hadn't been to Harvard Law School, or any other university.</p>
<p>"You can't major in pig racin'," he said.</p>
<p>As fate would have it, Tony Stewart, Denny Hamlin and the others -- the real NASCAR stars, not the four-legged Hogway heroes -- would be coming to the White House the next afternoon to meet Barack Obama. The urbane and literate President, a latter-day devotee of golf and fly-fishing, is not known as a stock-car (or pig racing) fanatic, but saluting the sport's reigning champion is an annual event and the demographic on the other rim of the Great Divide would be expecting it again.</p>
<p>So that was how I got to have a conversation with the King.</p>
<p>When I was admitted to the South Portico on Wednesday, Richard "The King" Petty, never a shy man, was flirting with a young woman in a Navy uniform. As usual, Petty was wearing dark glasses and a big ol' hat and his little moustache had been dyed black. The monarch of motor-sports is 72 years old.</p>
<p>Mr. Petty said that he had been to the White House "about a dozen times," not counting a trip with his senior class from Randleman, N. C., but meeting Barack Obama was not on the front page of his catalogue of dreams.</p>
<p>"I respect him for being the President," he said, "but I'm not a Democrat. I don't know what I am, I just know I'm a conservative."</p>
<p>(This was disingenuous. Mr. Petty ran for the office of North Carolina secretary of state in 1996 as a Republican and lost.)</p>
<p>"The further you are from the city," Mr. Petty explained, " the more conservative you are. The closer you get to the city, the more liberal you are. That's society. It's probably been that way since they signed the Declaration. I don't know. I wasn't there."</p>
<p>I asked the King about health care, and the current furor swirling around the Democratic President.</p>
<p>"No matter what they do, it don't need to be a socialist system," Mr. Petty replied.</p>
<p>I pointed over to one of the Secret Service men on the South Lawn.</p>
<p>"Do you care whether or not he has health insurance?" I asked.</p>
<p>"No," Mr. Petty replied. "It's not a problem for me. He's got his life in his society and I've got my life in my society. It's not apples and apples. It's not equality. I worked hard for what I have. Does he work as hard as I do? Why should he have what I have if he didn't work as hard?"</p>
<p>The King waxed philosophical. "I was reading an article about</p>
<p>a man named Smith who came over on the Mayflower," he said. "All his people were starving, and he told 'em, 'If you don't work, you don't eat.' That's my philosophy, too."</p>
<p>The NASCAR event lasted only 10 minutes and the crowd was breaking up. The King and the President caught each other's eye and the Big Guy gave Mr. Petty the thumbs-up.</p>
<p>"You're a great American," Barack Obama said to Mr. Petty.</p>
<p>"I won't tell him you're not a Democrat," I whispered in the great driver's ear.</p>
<p>"He already knows," the King replied.</p>

</p>
<p>There will be a renewed focus on health care from the Saskatchewan Party government -- even as it adjusts to more straitened financial circumstances -- as it heads into the fall, Premier Brad Wall said Thursday.</p>
<p>With the Sask. Party wrapping up its annual caucus retreat, Wall said government MLAs indicated clearly that health care was at "the top of the list."</p>
<p>While touting the government's recruitment strategy for health-care professionals, Wall said there hasn't been as much progress on reducing waiting lists as desired.</p>
<p>"There are areas of success, as you know, in cardiac care where wait times, there is progress being made. But in orthopedics, you know, people who are looking for hips, hip replacements and knee surgeries, the list is too long. It's just too long and so that was actually very much part of the discussion," he said in a telephone interview from Nipawin.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Surgical Care Network website said there were 27,177 people waiting for surgery in the province as of March, with the long-term trend line essentially holding steady during the last two years.</p>
<p>Among the options being looked at are increased co-operation with other provinces and hiring more nurse-practitioners in the province.</p>
<p>Of primary concern is a shortage of doctors, he said. There are 102 vacancies for physicians posted on the government's health recruitment website, compared to 94 last December and 84 in the spring of 2007. The Sask. Party has been moving to increase training positions at the University of Saskatchewan's medical school, as well as residency positions across the province.</p>
<p>He said there will be language in the October throne speech to start the legislature session on health but likely not specific new measures ahead of next spring's budget.</p>
<p>The caucus retreat followed hard on the heels of the government announcing that potash revenues would be $1.3 billion less than it projected in its budget just over three months ago.</p>
<p>"The other theme of the last few days was fiscal caution, making sure we are living within our means," said Wall.</p>
<p>NDP finance critic Trent Wotherspoon said the attention paid to health care suggested Wall was trying to "change the channel following the billion-dollar mistake in the budget."</p>
<p>"Certainly we think it deserves his rightful attention. What we know is that health care is certainly in no better circumstance than when they took office two years ago," he said, saying there is a "doctor crisis" in parts of rural Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>Wotherspoon said the government's smaller wallet has a direct impact on how it handles health issues. He noted the province deferred $95 million in funding for a proposed children's hospital in Saskatoon in order to re-balance its budget while allocating no extra funding to deal with the H1N1 virus, even though the province estimates the cost at up to $32 million.</p>
<p>There are also three major contracts with health-care unions that must be settled and a potential cost to the measures advocated by the government's "patient-first review" when it is released, he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Focus h1n1 fight on school kids, researchers say</b>

<p>As Canadian health officials grapple with plans to combat a potential swine flu outbreak this fall, a major new study suggests a can't-miss strategy to prevent its spread: Make sure the (school) kids are all right.</p>
<p>In a paper published today in the journal Science, U.S. researchers say mass inoculations of elementary and high school students - and their parents - would knock out key breeding grounds for any form of flu.</p>
<p>And cooling these cauldrons of communicable disease would prevent many of those most imperilled by flu - the very young and elderly - from catching it in the first place.</p>
<p>It's an idea that intrigues one of Canada's top influenza experts, who will likely offer it as an option at a Health Canada meeting next week to hammer out a strategy for the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"What I find interesting about this (paper) is that they're really focusing on the fact that young kids are the incubators of this," says Dr. Michael Gardam, head of infections disease control at Ontario's Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>"I like to call (kids) viral culture media on legs. That is their purpose in life, to get infected with things."</p>
<p>Gardam says kids, in turn, infect their parents, who take the viruses to workplaces, stores, theatres and old age homes.</p>
<p>Therefore, priority targeting of these two groups for flu vaccinations is the best way to keep major outbreaks at bay, the paper's lead author says.</p>
<p>"We were expecting more delicate results - that in this situation you should do this, and in this situation you should do that," says Jan Medlock, a mathematician at South Carolina's Clemson University.</p>
<p>But no matter the quality or amount of vaccine you have, or the type of flu you're dealing with, the school strategy would work best to halt the spread and save lives, Medlock says.</p>
<p>The study used mathematical modelling from surveys and two prior influenza pandemics, 1918 and 1957, to determine optimal vaccination ages, he says.</p>
<p>Looking at death and infection rates, years of life lost and economic costs, Medlock found that inoculating children aged 5 to 19 (largely students) and adults aged 30 to 39 (key parenting years) would stop the spread most effectively and with the fewest number of shots.</p>
<p>Most flu vaccine campaigns have instead focused mainly on toddlers and older people.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal -- Newfoundland's health minister Paul Oram is so new to his job that the CV posted on his department's website charts his career only up to his previous posting, as minister in charge of business.</p>
<p>Oram swapped portfolios with colleague Ross Wiseman last month after a series of controversies that included botched cancer tests and radiology treatments shattered public confidence in the province's health department.</p>
<p>That makes Oram the most junior health minister on the Canadian scene, but not by much.</p>
<p>British Columbia, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick all have health ministers who have been on the job for less than 90 days and, across Canada, not a single minister has served a full mandate in the health post.</p>
<p>With three years as health minister, Manitoba's Theresa Oswald is the country's longest serving member of the group. Ontario's David Caplan has been the province's minister of health for only a bit more than a year and the opposition parties have been calling for his resignation since last spring over the eHealth spending scandal.</p>
<p>Yves Bolduc was parachuted straight out of his medical practice into the Quebec cabinet 14 months ago. It is an understatement to say that he has been on a steep learning curve ever since.</p>
<p>This summer, his uncertain handling of two high-profile issues - involving faulty breast cancer tests and what turned out to be overzealous government meddling with the province's private abortion clinics - has a vocal section of Quebec's medical establishment publicly questioning his truthfulness and his competence.</p>
<p>The jury is still out on federal minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>While some consider her a potential rising star of the Harper cabinet, the planning that presided over the appointment of a political neophyte to the portfolio last fall did not include a major crisis in the form of a potential H1N1 pandemic. Health is an exclusive constitutional jurisdiction of the provinces and the federal health portfolio has become a bit of a backwater on Stephen Harper's watch. After the last election, the expectation was not that the seat of health minister would become a hot one in the near future.</p>
<p>In hindsight, the Prime Minister has cause to regret having shuffled Tony Clement out of health and into industry.</p>
<p>Among the current class of health ministers, Clement - on whose Ontario watch the SARS episode unfolded - would have stood out for his experience with a major health crisis.</p>
<p>Over the past five years, the environment and the economy successively eclipsed health care as the top concerns of Canadians. Provincial and federal governments redeployed their talents accordingly. In many capitals, the health portfolio has once again become a second-tier position, a kind of revolving door on the way to higher-profile challenges.</p>
<p>As a result, if the H1N1 file takes a turn for the worse over the next few months, a majority of provinces - including the three most populous ones - as well as the federal government will be relying on untested ministers to see them through an unprecedented public health crisis.</p>
<p>It is a bit like going into a recession with a critical mass of neophyte finance ministers around the federal-provincial table. Politicians do not cure the sick but, in a crisis, the competence of their leadership is a determining factor in maintaining public confidence. The daily sight of a health minister who looks out of his or her depth is hardly what a political spin doctor would order in the current circumstances.</p>

<p>Internet giant <span class="companylink">Google</span> has joined the fight against swine flu.</p>
<p>Known best for its ubiquitous search engine, <span class="companylink">Google</span> has partnered with the well-known Public Library of Science to launch an experimental website Thursday they say will speed up scientific discovery by allowing researchers to immediately share their findings and ideas about the H1N1 virus with the world's scientific and medical communities.</p>
<p>Harold Varmus, PLoS's chairman, announced the project on <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s official blog, saying a small research community is going to run the website on <span class="companylink">Google</span>'s Knol online encyclopedia and the research articles will be vetted by expert moderators.</p>
<p>"The successful development of open access publishing by organizations including the Public Library of Science in recent years is a dramatic illustration of how the Internet is revolutionizing scientific communication," said Varmus. "The launch site already features new findings from some outstanding influenza researchers."</p>
<p>In Canada, 71 people have died from the H1N1 virus, according to the latest numbers from the Public Health Agency of Canada. Nearly 1,400 Canadians have been hospitalized, 240 of whom were admitted to an intensive care unit, as of Aug. 8. Earlier this week, the World Health Organization reported 1,799 deaths from the pandemic since the new virus was uncovered in April.</p>
<p>The four articles already published on PLoS Currents: Influenza cover subjects including the transmission of the virus in the tropics and vaccination strategies.</p>
<p>Submissions to PLoS Currents are not peer-reviewed in detail, so the results and conclusions "must be regarded as preliminary," said Varmus.</p>
<p>"In time, it is therefore likely that PLoS Currents contributors will submit their work for publication in a formal journal, and the PLoS Journals will welcome these submissions," he added.</p>

<p>YELLOWKNIFE -- From highways to harbours to housing, Stephen Harper insists his government's focus on the North goes far beyond the elaborate military operation now under way to assert Canada's Arctic sovereignty.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister made a series of announcements yesterday – first in the Nunavut fishing village of Pangnirtung, and later in Yellowknife, the capital of the Northwest Territories – aimed at highlighting what he said is an unprecedented level of federal spending in northern communities.</p>
<p>The announcements followed a day of carefully staged photo ops of the Prime Minister at sea with the Canadian Forces' Operation Nanook. Mr. Harper flew a Sea King helicopter, dove with the Forces in a submarine and took the helm of the frigate HMCS Toronto.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister said he agrees with Inuit leaders who say Canada asserts its northern sovereignty not solely by military means, but through the people who inhabit the North.</p>
<p>“I know the opposition will sometimes criticize us for our reliance, or too much reliance, on the military side,” he said yesterday in Pangnirtung.</p>
<p>“Let's be clear. On every trip I've been here, we've emphasized not just military, but also the actions we're taking on economic, social, environmental development and on governance.”</p>
<p>Mr. Harper said Operation Nanook has value beyond the assertion of sovereignty because it is a good training opportunity for the Canadian Forces.</p>
<p>Although a lot of construction is under way in the North, those who live here have drawn the national media's attention this week to the serious hurdles that remain.</p>
<p>Diesel generators power the North, and many are outdated. Housing is in such short supply in Nunavut that Inuit fear the next round of H1N1 flu will spread like wildfire through overcrowded homes.</p>
<p>“We know the needs are acute,” Mr. Harper said. “I can also tell you that the investments we're making here, while they may not satisfy all the demands, these on a per-capita basis, vastly exceed what we're doing in the southern part of the country.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister expressed concern that aboriginals and northerners aren't necessarily benefiting from the northern spike in construction, mining and government jobs.</p>
<p>To that end, he and the three territorial premiers announced a new $36.5-million labour agreement yesterday in Yellowknife. The deal will finance skills training for workers in the North, regardless of whether they qualify for employment insurance.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper said skills training will help in moving toward an environment in the North where aboriginals and northern residents are the first people hired when jobs become available.</p>
<p>“We do not want a transient economy here,” he said in Yellowknife. “We do not want an economy primarily fuelled by people who come here, we take resources out of the ground, the people leave, the resources and the money scatters elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Using housing and health care as examples, the Prime Minister said he wants federal investments to be delivered locally as much as possible.</p>
<p>“We want to, over time, train health practitioners in this area, who can be part of building their own health-care system, and create – among particularly our aboriginal peoples – a sense of opportunity and possibility in their own lives,” he said. “So that's really central to our vision in the long term.”</p>
<p>In addition to the labour agreement, Mr. Harper announced funding for five highway improvement projects in the NWT. He also confirmed construction of a $17-million small-craft harbour will begin this fall in Pangnirtung.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No flu pay for nurses; Doctors could earn as much as $518 per hour in a public emergency</b>

</p>
<p>Alberta nurses will not be paid a special rate to treat patients infected with H1N1 if the spread of the virus forces the province to declare a public health emergency.</p>
<p>UnderaplannegotiatedbytheAlbertaMedicalAssociation, some doctors could receive as much as$518 an hour to work during the pandemic, but no such deal has been struck with nurses.</p>
<p>James Finstad, a spokesman with Alberta Health Services, said nurses are currently under contract and would be expected to live up to those terms if H1N1 mushrooms into a full-blown crisis.</p>
<p>Doctors, however, are mostly self-employed. Dr. Noel Grisdale, president of the Alberta Medical Association, said the steep hourly rates they're negotiating are meant to guarantee doctors' incomes if they abandon their practices to join a provincewide response to the crisis.</p>
<p>"If all of a sudden their office is shut down and patients are told to stay home, they still have overhead and salaries to pay to their staff," Grisdale said.</p>
<p>"We need to let physicians know they have payment coming for work they do in a pandemic situation."</p>
<p>Physicians who opt to work with the provincial plan will be guaranteed a minimum salary based on the average of what</p>
<p>they've made over the past year. They'll also have the option to bill either for every procedure they perform or patient they see--known as fee for service--or at an hourly rate.</p>
<p>The current proposed rates are$518.45 an hour during night shifts, $403.24 an hour during evenings and weekends and $259.23 an hour during weekday shifts.</p>
<p>There is no way to accurately gauge how much more physicians who treat H1N1 patients will be paid compared to their typical hourly rate because there are many different types of physicians, Grisdale said.</p>
<p>"Five-hundred dollars an hour in the middle of the night is more than the majority of physicians would be making," he said.</p>
<p>The province and the AMA are also considering a program that would provide a guaranteed income for physicians unable to work because of illness as a result of treating pandemic patients.</p>
<p>As for the nurses, the union that represents them in Alberta says they have not been consulted about any element of pandemic planning, payment or otherwise.</p>
<p>Jane Sustrik, second vice-president of the United Nurses of Alberta, said her members will report for duty during a crisis, no matter what they're paid, but they do have other worries.</p>
<p>"It's not the $500 an hour or the$200 an hour (the doctors could make). It's all the other pieces," Sustrik said.</p>
<p>"Nurses are caregivers and they want to be at work. That's what they do. But they want to be safe at work."</p>
<p>Sustrik said nurses want to know that there will be enough protective masks and other safety equipment available.</p>
<p>The union also feels staffing levels are paper-thin across the province already. If nurses fall ill in any significant numbers during a flu outbreak, the situation could become critical.</p>
<p>The risk that large numbers of doctors and nurses will contract the virus while treating patients is real, said a flu expert at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>Dr. Jim Dickinson said one medical resident in Calgary has already contracted H1N1 from a patient and, if the flu spreads widely this fall, she likely won't be the last.</p>
<p>"Whoever is assessing the patient, getting up close, right in front of them, is going to be at risk," Dickinson said.</p>
<p>During the SARS outbreak in 2003, three nurses and one doctor died in Ontario. Eight doctors also died in Hong Kong, Dickinson said.</p>
<p>The province has not yet decided whether private doctors offices can expect help when it comes to stocking gowns, gloves, masks and drugs needed to cope with a widespread H1N1 outbreak.</p>

</p>
<p>Being prudent, health authorities in Ontario and across the country are gearing up for a potential outbreak of the H1N1 flu this fall, with provincial and federal health agencies working to ensure a strategy is in place to deal with the virus. As of June 1, Hamilton's Public Health Services Department had confirmed seven cases of the virus here. While none of these has required hospitalization, officials continue to monitor the situation closely with the beginning of the new school year nearly upon us.</p>
<p>Problems like these might be unexpected or rare, but they don't have to be unanticipated. In fact, this can be the ideal opportunity for Canadian business owners to think about their contingency plans -- whether they're for H1N1, or any other business eventuality.</p>
<p>According to a Harris/Decima poll commissioned by BMO Financial Group, Ontario small business owners have been more likely to develop a contingency plan before the current downturn, compared to owners elsewhere in the country. Indeed, those with such plans see them as major drivers of success during challenging economic times.</p>
<p>This makes sense -- companies need to be able to cope with all kinds of situations that have a direct impact on their workforce and the way they do business, whether it is health-related, an interruption in the supply of raw materials or the results of a general economic downturn.</p>
<p>But when it comes to health- related issues like H1N1, the majority of small business owners still have no plan in place. When business owners were surveyed in June, only one Canadian business in 10 reported having developed a specific business continuity plan to deal with the H1N1 virus. Most businesses (82 per cent) did not even have a generic plan to deal with an emerging health issue. Among those who are least prepared are the owners of micro-businesses -- those with fewer than five employees. The impact can be significant -- if just one employee becomes ill at one of these smaller firms, this can represent more than 20 per cent of that company's workforce.</p>
<p>At BMO, our commercial account teams have been working with small business customers to help them put contingency plans in place. Our experts share best practices they have seen from working with numerous businesses across multiple industries.</p>
<p>When drafting these types of plans, business owners and managers should be sure to consider the following components:</p>
<p>Identify different scenarios that may impact your industry, and in particular that might impact your company. Scenarios could range from sickness and fear of a pandemic keeping employees and customers at home, to power outages or labour disruptions. Business owners should be taking steps now -- such as setting up brainstorming sessions with your managers -- to make sure, to the best of your ability, no items have been overlooked.</p>
<p>Develop a list of activities to be undertaken for each scenario identified, and document them so all your key employees have a clear understanding as to what their responsibilities are under each scenario.</p>
<p>Develop a communication plan, such as a call tree and a schedule of communications, to ensure all your employees can be contacted in case of a major event and can then proceed to undertake the specific activities assigned to them. A good communication plan also includes key customers and suppliers.</p>
<p>Contingency plans should always include some elements specific to a health emergency. For instance, after identifying your priority services and operations (without which your company would cease to function), management should undertake to cross-train staff to cover these off in the event of an emergency, set policies for flexible hours and alternative compensation, and establish guidelines to maintain hygiene at work to minimize the chances of additional workers falling ill.</p>
<p>Finally, the plan is of no value until you have communicated it widely to people in your company. Don't keep the plan to yourself. After all, what if the crisis comes about because of something that has happened to you?</p>
<p>While the threat of H1N1 flu is creating some anxiety for many of us, the fact that this is happening now can be viewed as a blessing in disguise. Sometimes we need something like this to spur us into action. In fact, if Canadian health authorities today are relatively well prepared for the H1N1 flu bug, it is in large part because of the learnings derived from the SARS outbreak just six years ago.</p>
<p>Anyone currently without a plan should use this as both the impetus and opportunity to draw one up. Seek out the advice of experts -- your lawyers, your technology providers, your bankers, and other trusted advisers -- to make sure you are ready for anything that comes your way.</p>
<p>It's not difficult to do and it is the smart thing to do for your business.</p>

</div><div>Bloomberg</div>

<p>Canada's hog herd shrank 6.7 per cent in the year ended June 30, and the cattle inventory declined as global meat demand waned, Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>Canadian farmers had 12.105 million hogs on hand as of July 1, compared with 12.98 million a year earlier, the government agency said Thursday in a report. Ranches and farms held 14.84 million head of cattle, down 2.3 per cent from 15.195 million, according to the report.</p>
<p>The hog-breeding herd was 4.6 per cent smaller than a year earlier at 1.38 million sows, Statistics Canada said. Producers began culling hog herds in 2006, as profits diminished because of "high feed costs, low commodity prices, a strong Canadian dollar and the economic downturn," the agency said in the report.</p>
<p>"Recently, new country-of-origin labelling regulations in the United States have constrained market access," the Statistics Canada said. "The perception of the H1N1 virus has also had a negative impact on markets," the report's authors wrote, referring to the swine flu.</p>
<p>The U. S. country-of-origin labelling law, known as COOL, went into effect in September and requires meat and other food products to bear labels indicating where they were produced.</p>
<p>The law contributed to a 35-per-cent drop in Canadian hog exports and a 32-per-cent decline in cattle exports in the first six months of 2009, the report said.</p>
<p>"The COOL regulation has limited Canadian cattle access to feedlots and packers, causing exports to the U. S. to decrease," the agency said.</p>
<p>Canada's sheep and lamb inventories as of July 1 were little changed from a year earlier at 1.06 million animals, according to the report.</p>

<p>A tennis player competing for Manitoba at the Canada Games in Prince Edward Island has been quarantined while Games officials await test results for H1N1 influenza. Officials said Thursday it will be late Friday before it's known whether the athlete has swine flu.</p>
<p>Muzeen Ismath, a 17-year-old from Winnipeg, showed symptoms of the flu Wednesday morning and was immediately quarantined and tested, Team Manitoba manager Barry Moroz said Wednesday night. Moroz said Ismath had a fever of nearly 39 C and doctors decided to play it safe.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Docs may get H1N1 pay of $500 an hour; AMA says incentive necessary</b>
</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div>

</p>
<p>Alberta doctors who may be paid $518 an hour to treat patients with H1N1 under a proposed "physician financial support program" need the financial incentive because of the increased health risks, the Alberta Medical Association president says.</p>
<p>"They're going to be working at the front lines around the virus. If they go home they can potentially pass it on to family members," AMA president Dr. Noel Grisdale said.</p>
<p>"It's important to let physicians know that they would be supported financially."</p>
<p>The proposed program would ensure there would be enough physicians to take care of people, he said.</p>
<p>"We have a calling to practise medicine and this is a situation of the ultimate calling to take care of patients," Grisdale said.</p>
<p>"If I got sick I would want to know that nurses and doctors will be there to take care of me and I'm glad that there's something like this in place."</p>
<p>Physicians who opt to work with patients with H1N1 would be paid $518.45 an hour during night shifts, $403.24 an hour during evenings and weekends and $259.23 an hour during weekday shifts, he said.</p>
<p>The proposed pay rates would apply if a state of public health emergency was declared.</p>
<p>Nurses and other health care workers likely won't receive a financial support program because they are salaried, while physicians are self-employed, Grisdale said.</p>

<p>R amping up bureaucracy never brought any virus to its knees, so creating a position for an independent national flu czar with the layers of staffing and all the expensive encumbrances that bureaucracy trails behind it like a bridal train is a waste of time, resources and money.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association Journal is calling for just such a position to be created, saying a flu czar would be able to issue orders to the provinces and move personnel and equipment around during the H1N1 pandemic expected this fall. However, there are already two high-ranking individuals whose job that should be--federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and Dr. David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer of Canada. Aglukkaq and Butler-Jones should be working in concert with provincial health ministers, their staffs, and the chief medical officers of health at the regional levels to co-ordinate Canada's flu-fighting efforts. There is absolutely no need to conjure up a whole new bureaucracy when there are perfectly capable people whose task it is to deal specifically with public health issues. If anyone is bent on having a flu czar, Butler-Jones could be designated as such and his powers expanded accordingly.</p>
<p>Fears of a lack of collaboration or co-operation on the provinces' part are unwarranted. The provincial health ministers and medical officers can get on the phone to each other to coordinate their strategies. There's no need for a czar-type middleman to bring all these various health officials together--after all, conference calls have been invented. And the buck should stop with Aglukkaq, who should be able, as federal Health minister, to command the respect and attention of the provincial ministries when she issues orders based on the best information from her own advisers.</p>
<p>CMAJ editor-in-chief Paul Hebert, whose name appears on the journal's editorial, writes that a health czar would have "executive powers across all jurisdictions . . . (and would)make sure researchers have the money needed now to answer the urgent outstanding questions about this emerging health threat." Hebert says the czar would also "communicate to all sectors of society that everyone has the responsibility to make an individual pandemic action plan." He also calls for a newly appointed czar to organize a summit so health-care providers, community planners, critical-care workers, first responders and others can "communicate next steps and . . . ensure that actions taken by leaders will work at the ground level."</p>
<p>Yet, all of these things should be part of the job descriptions of everyone from Aglukkaq down to local officials. Hebert writes, "This is not a time for complacency." Neither is it a time for more bureaucracy. Let the experts who are already in place do their jobs.</p>

<p>In the arts and pro sports, large gatherings of people are essential to stay in business. So in preparation for a possible outbreak of H1N1, many in the industry say they aren't taking the threat for granted.</p>
<p>Whether it's something as simple as installing hand sanitizers just about everywhere in the building, or covering the cost of vaccinating employees, or even just making sure staff who feel unwell don't come to work, institutions such as Epcor Centre, Theatre Calgary and Cineplex Odeon are all in the process of instituting policies designed to prevent the rapid spread of H1N1 should there be an outbreak this autumn.</p>
<p>For Theatre Calgary president Tom McCabe, there is the memory of the not-so-long-ago impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak on various southern Ontario theatre festivals such as Stratford and Shaw, both of which were hammered when jittery American tourists avoided Ontario that summer.</p>
<p>"It's a serious issue," Mc-Cabe says, "and we've gone down the road of installing the sterile handwashers everywhere in the building.</p>
<p>"Also, we're encouraging everybody to get inoculated, including our out-of-town actors, and we'll pay for it if necessary. We want everybody to be as protected as possible."</p>
<p>Other organizations housed in the Epcor Centre, such as Alberta Theatre Projects and One Yellow Rabbit, are following a policy similar to Theatre Calgary's.</p>
<p>Cineplex Odeon vice-president of communications and investor relations Pat Marshall declined to go into specifics, but said the theatre chain has a plan in the event of an outbreak.</p>
<p>The Vipers baseball club is well aware of the threat posed by the H1N1 virus, thanks to the experience of the Tijuana Potros franchise, which was forced to scrap plans to participate in the Golden Baseball League in 2009 because of the uncertainty caused by the H1N1 outbreak in Mexico.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 virus health risk and the necessary government response and actions have wreaked havoc with the economy and businesses small and large throughout the country of Mexico," said Potros president Jose Manuel Pena in May. "It is not possible to operate with this uncertainty that keeps sponsors from committing, fans from buying tickets and the stadium unavailable to host public events."</p>

</div><div>Tom Spears   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>535 words</div><div>21 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The best way to contain a flu pandemic is to vaccinate all schoolchildren and their parents, but skip most adults, as schools are the main breeding ground for the bug, a major new study claims.</p>
<p>Vaccinating health-care workers helps too, says the study by Yale and Clemson universities.</p>
<p>"The biggest part of the story is you can stop the transmission chain very effectively by vaccinating schoolchildren," says Clemson mathematician Jan Medlock.</p>
<p>This challenges the view of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends vaccinating--in order of importance--pregnant women first, then caregivers or parents of infants, then health-care workers, then babies, children and teens, then young adults, and finally adults from ages 25 to 65.</p>
<p>Canada hasn't yet issued its priorities, but has hinted at beginning with shots for people aged five to 40, and native communities.</p>
<p>Now Medlock and Alison Galvani of the Yale medical school says it's best to vaccinate those most likely to transmit viruses, rather than those at highest risk for complications.</p>
<p>They looked at two simple measures:How many illnesses, and how many deaths can one prevent by vaccinating different age groups? They also studied more complex measures such as total number of years of life lost across a population, and a pandemic's cost to the economy. Assuming there's a good vaccine, all those measures pointed to the same strategy for vaccinating.</p>
<p>"The best thing to do is to vaccinate schoolchildren --so, ages five to 19," as well as parents aged 30 to 39, Medlock said.</p>
<p>The study is published in the research journal Science.</p>
<p>The protective effect was so strong, he said, that vaccinating a mere 40 million Americans would contain the pandemic at the lowest possible level. That compares to more than 100 million doses of vaccine distributed in a normal flu year for the U. S, population.</p>
<p>But there's a political dimension as well: Some parents would refuse to vaccinate their children.</p>
<p>Newspapers across North American have been filled with letters from parents worried that this vaccine has been fast-tracked through safety tests.</p>
<p>As well, Medlock acknowledged, this flu isn't a terrible threat for children. "Their mortality is almost zero, and their symptoms are pretty mild in general. There's a consent question. We've seen all sorts of scares with additives to vaccine and so on."</p>
<p>At the University of Western Ontario, Dr. Marina Salvadori is a pediatric vaccination expert, and a member of the National Advisory Committee on Immunization.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be a simple measure to require mass vaccinations, she says. For instance, Texas faced a backlash from families when it tried to require human papillomavirus vaccinations for girls.</p>
<p>It might be possible to allow families to abstain from vaccinations on medical, religious or philosophical grounds, as Ontario law allows for measles shots in schoolchildren, she said.</p>

<p>Taking care of business and employees is the goal of most Calgary companies preparing for an expected resurgence of H1N1 this fall, with one company likening the chore to the flurry of activity leading up to the Y2K computer scare nine years ago.</p>
<p>WestJet suspended flights to and from Mexico for several weeks in May after the World Health Organization and Canadian authorities signalled growing alarm over the thousands of cases of H1N1.Many people were hospitalized and there were dozens of deaths.</p>
<p>The airline is prepared to suspend flights again, if necessary, said spokesman Robert Palmer this week, but it's also being careful not to overreact.</p>
<p>"In considering such a move, we would apply the same principles we applied the first time -- the spread of the disease, risk to the health and safety of our guests, guest feedback, the number of guests cancelling, etc.," he said. "Sitting here today, it's impossible to say we would definitely do this or that. I can say, however, that we'll keep a very close eye on the situation in Mexico this winter and make decisions as needed, when needed."</p>
<p>He added WestJet has no specific plan for keeping flu sufferers off its planes, other than standard procedures for preventing people who seem ill from boarding.</p>
<p>The airline doesn't have a specific pandemic plan, he said, but its emergency plan involves steps such as shuffling office workers into the front lines to keep passengers moving.</p>
<p>This year's pandemic scare reminds Liz Hannah, team lead, advisory, for natural gas producer <span class="companylink">EnCana Corp</span>., of another viral threat nine years ago--the Y2K bug. The fear that every computer in the world could shut down when its internal clock ticked over from 1999 led to dire warnings and intensive preparation.</p>
<p>"I think the planning that every company did for Y2K was perhaps a similar exercise in business continuity and impact to staff and systems," said Hannah. "But it was a very specific time frame as opposed to something that is impacting health."</p>
<p>She said the fight against H1N1 so far includes lots of information for employees about using disinfecting stations and washing hands, the symptoms of the flu and what to do if they have the disease.</p>
<p>Every department has a team in place to ensure key business functions continue in the event that large numbers of staff are home sick, she said.</p>
<p>"We've always had training and cross-training as something we take very seriously," said Hannah. "If there was absenteeism in any one area we would redeploy people and make sure that the operations continue, anything that has a regulatory requirement continues, anything that would impact safety would continue, we would be able to continue to pay people, so that the business can continue."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">EnCana</span> has 3,650 employees and contractors working in Calgary and a total employee and contractor count of just over 8,000 scattered throughout North America.</p>
<p>Hannah said <span class="companylink">EnCana</span>'s policy is to thoroughly sanitize and disinfect offices or shared space occupied by any employee who has even a suspected case of H1N1.</p>
<p>Calgary-based Canadian Pacific Railway is also making sure employees know as much as possible about the risks.</p>
<p>"Right now, we're doing what the majority of companies are doing, which is just making sure our employees know the basics--communicating with them about flu and what they should do, advising them when it's good to stay home, and when not, general education about flu in general, and not necessarily H1N1," said spokeswoman Breanne Feigel.</p>
<p>"We recognize that people get sick all the time and each department has operational plans. The big focus is on watching absenteeism."</p>
<p>CPR has 3,500 employees in Calgary, but its flu plan encompasses all 16,000 workers in Canada and the United States. Feigel said the company is waiting for more information about flu vaccinations before deciding whether it will offer them to employees.</p>
<p>Information for Calgary employers on H1N1 flu is available from a number of sources, including the Calgary Chamber of Commerce, which has posted the 67-page A Pandemic Planning Toolkit for Businesses on its website.</p>
<p>It warns that the Public Health Agency of Canada figures an influenza pandemic could involve 4.5 million to 10.6 million Canadians being off work, the deaths of 11,000 to 58,000 people and the hospitalization of 34,000 to 138,000 people.</p>
<p>It adds that Canada's Pandemic Influenza Plan for the Health Sector warns absenteeism could be between 20 and 25 per cent, but New Zealand's pandemic influenza plan has ranges closer to 40 per cent.</p>
<p>Chamber president and CEO Heather Douglas said smaller companies are likely to be less specifically prepared for pandemic and more at risk than big employers. Ninety per cent of Calgary's 50,000 businesses have 50 or fewer employees.</p>
<p>"Most companies have some sort of business contingency planning in place for unexpected events of any sort and pandemic planning tends to fall into one of those buckets," she added. "If it goes on for months, that's a different situation."</p>
<p>Calgary Economic Development, meanwhile, is promoting WORKshift, an initiative to promote and accelerate the adoption of telework within the business community to help deal with the threat of the flu.</p>

<p>Ottawa athletes staged their own version of Own the Podium Thursday at the Canada Summer Games in Prince Edward Island, collecting three gold, two silver and two bronze medals in rowing, tennis, sailing and wrestling.</p>
<p>Own the Podium is a national program designed to help Canadian athletes win more Olympic and Paralympic medals.</p>
<p>Mariel Boomgaardt and Samantha Kayser led the charge, helping Ontario capture gold and bronze medals in rowing as national capital athletes snapped their four-day medal drought.</p>
<p>Boomgaardt and Kayser joined Ottawa Rowing Club teammates Sarah Black and Cheryl Copson to form half of the boat that improved its start and took gold in women's eights with coxswain. They won in four minutes 8.72 seconds. British Columbia was second in 4:12.76.</p>
<p>Earlier, Boomgaardt and Kayser earned bronze in women's pairs in 5:12.22. B.C. won in 5:02.44.</p>
<p>It was a bittersweet day for Boomgaardt.</p>
<p>"I'm super happy we executed our plan exactly (in the eights)," Boomgaardt said in a telephone interview. "But I was a little disappointed with our pairs race. We just didn't have the juice to take it past B.C."</p>
<p>On the tennis court, Ottawa players secured one gold and one bronze in the individual singles and doubles playoff matches, and a silver in the mixed team event.</p>
<p>Elianne Douglas-Miron of Ottawa and Amy He of Burlington were aggressive and defeated Quebec's Marie-Frederique Bédard of Île Bizard and Marianne Jodoin of Varennes 7-6 (7-4), 6-1 for the women's doubles gold.</p>
<p>Gloucester's Gabriela Dabrowski was the women's singles bronze medallist, beating Kristina Sanjevic of Nova Scotia 6-3, 6-0. Edward Nguyen of Ottawa lost the men's singles bronze 6-3, 6-0 to Nikolai Haessig of 100 Mile House, B.C.</p>
<p>In the mixed team event, Quebec dominated Ontario 4-1 in the best-of-seven final. Dabrowski, Douglas-Miron and Nguyen received silvers.</p>
<p>Dabrowski lost 6-1, 4-6, 7-5 to Eugenie Bouchard of Westmount in singles, while Douglas-Miron and He fell to Bédard and Jodoin 6-1, 3-6, 6-0 in women's doubles.</p>
<p>"I feel great," Douglas-Miron said. "It would have been nice for everyone to win the (mixed team) gold, but you can't win them all."</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's Tedmund Skiffington and Jonathan Reid, both of Halifax, scored three firsts and one second in the final four sailing races to edge Peter Soosalu of Ottawa and Michael Blumer of Toronto for the men's 29er class gold. Skiffington and Reid finished with 17 points, while silver medal-winning Soosalu and Blumer, who had three seconds and a first Thursday, had 19 points.</p>
<p>Undefeated Ontario edged B.C. 29-21 to win gold in wrestling's men's team event. Ottawa's Ilya Abelev was on the gold-medal team.</p>
<p>Jamie Riggs of Manotick tied for 38th in the 120-kilometre men's cycling road race at 2:51:38, which was only 12 seconds behind winner Eric Boily of Quebec.</p>
<p>Ontario lost 83-81 to Nova Scotia in the men's basketball semifinals. Ottawa's Justin Shaver scored six points and had eight rebounds.</p>
<p>In the women's basketball semifinals, Alberta clobbered Ontario 70-47. Kellie Ring of Gloucester and and Micaella Riche of Ottawa had four points apiece in the loss.</p>
<p>In the men's three-metre diving final, Brennan Villemaire of Ottawa was 11th with 330.90 points and Jamie Bissett of Ottawa was 12th with 289.50.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, A tennis player competing for Manitoba has been quarantined while Games officials await test results for H1N1 influenza. Muzeen Ismath, a 17-year-old from Winnipeg, showed symptoms of the flu Wednesday morning and was immediately quarantined and tested, Team Manitoba manager Barry Moroz said late Wednesday.</p>

<p>Emergency planners at Ottawa hospitals are working with the province on ways to share protective respirators, gowns, gloves and surgical face masks should health-care providers run low on such critical supplies with an expected resurgence of flu this fall.</p>
<p>Hospitals are also reviewing their stockpiles of diagnostic equipment and antiviral drugs, such as Tamiflu, to ensure each institution has enough of the supplies to treat patients who are hospitalized with severe flu symptoms, or who are at risk of developing life-threatening flu.</p>
<p>"We're at the standpoint now of looking across (Eastern Ontario) at what are the stockpiles that are available at individual institutions," said Thomas Hayes, who chairs a committee of emergency planners from area hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care providers.</p>
<p>The supply and flow of protective equipment for frontline health-care staff are crucial during a flu pandemic. Without enough to protect nurses, doctors and support staff from infection, they could refuse to report for duty, making an expected staffing crunch during a pandemic even worse.</p>
<p>For the time being, hospital officials are confident that they have stockpiled enough to get them through up to four weeks of large-scale flu outbreaks. At The Ottawa Hospital, that means having an adequate supply for up to 7,000 frontline employees.</p>
<p>"That's not four weeks of our normal usage, that's four weeks of anticipated heavy usage for pandemic-planning purposes," said Hayes, who's also the hospital's director of occupational safety and emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>In preparation for the fall flu season, the Ontario government is setting up an electronic registry to track regional requests for emergency supplies, said Hayes.</p>
<p>During the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, the Ontario government sent every physician in the province a starter kit containing samples of protective equipment to reduce their risk of infection when treating patients.</p>
<p>Since then, the province has established a pandemic plan that urges all health-care providers to keep, at their own expense, at least a month's supply of protective gear to cope during a pandemic. Most hospitals have complied, as have Ottawa Public Health and the city's paramedics, each of whom keeps its own supply, said Dr. Isra Levy, the city's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the H1N1 outbreaks over the past few months have revealed that some area pharmacists did not have a supply of antiviral drugs, Levy said.</p>
<p>In such cases, Ottawa Public Health's role is to help track down pharmacists in the city who have a supply that could be shared.</p>
<p>"We would try and find out where the pharmacies that did have them were and make that information available," said Levy.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Experts concerned about dangers of antibacterial products</b>
</div><div>JENNIFER YANG </div>
<div>672 words</div><div>21 August 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L3</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Antibacterial products are more popular than ever nowadays, thanks in part to fears over infectious diseases such as H1N1 and SARS.</p>
<p>But this week, the Canadian Medical Association called on the federal government to ban all antibacterial household products because of fears they cause bacterial resistance.</p>
<p>The motion was proposed by Ottawa family physician Kapil Khatter, who is also president of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment. He says he can understand the appeal of antibacterial products, but in reality they do more harm than good.</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail talks to some experts concerned about the risks of antibacterial household products.</p>
<p>Why are doctors worried about the growing popularity of antibacterial products?</p>
<p>A growing body of research is showing that antibacterial products can cause bacterial resistance, thus decreasing the effectiveness of antibiotics. The most common ingredient in antibacterial products is a chemical compound called triclosan, which was invented more than 35 years ago and used by doctors during surgical scrubs.</p>
<p>But as the chemical creeps into more and more household products, it's also causing bacteria to become more resistant – not just to triclosan, but also other antibiotics such as isoniazid, a drug used to treat and prevent tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Researchers are also finding that the majority of women are now showing traces of triclosan in their breast milk, Dr. Khatter says. “We don't know what the potential impacts of that are,” he says. “Breast milk is kind of the canary in the coal mine. It's the easiest way we can measure if something's building up in people.”</p>
<p>What are the environmental effects of chemicals like triclosan?</p>
<p>Research has shown that over 95 per cent of products containing triclosan are disposed of through residential drains. Unfortunately, the compound is also extremely stable, so it tends to stick around in the environment.</p>
<p>According to Mike Layton, program manager with advocacy group Environmental Defence, triclosan can react to chlorine in drinking water and form chloroform, which is a carcinogen. And when triclosan reacts with light, it can actually form poisonous dioxins, he says.</p>
<p>Recent studies have also shown that triclosan is harmful to the development of frogs. This is a worrisome sign, says Mr. Layton, because the “repercussions just get amplified throughout the food chain.”</p>
<p>What kind of products contain triclosan?</p>
<p>There are hundreds of products that contain triclosan nowadays, with everything from liquid soaps and toothpastes to deodorants, clothing, tissues and toys. Beyond Pesticides, a non-profit organization in the United States, has an extensive list of everyday products containing triclosan, such as Colgate Total, Old Spice High Endurance Stick Deodorant, Aveeno Therapeutic Shave Gel and J Cloth towels.</p>
<p>What should I use instead to cut down on my risk of H1N1?</p>
<p>When it comes to protecting oneself against the spread of infectious diseases, it's all about going back to the basics, doctors say.</p>
<p>“Really all you need is soap and water and the alcohol rubs that are available,” Dr. Khatter said. “There isn't any benefit to going to these other products – there's only potential harm.”</p>
<p>What about sanitizing gels like Purell? Are they safe to use?</p>
<p>For Dr. Khatter, the answer is yes. In fact, he prefers using alcohol rubs to soaps because they're easier on the skin and every bit as effective. “We're not as worried about [alcohol rubs] causing bacterial resistance,” he says.</p>
<p>But the efficacy of alcohol rubs also depends on how they're being used, Dr. Khatter says. It's important that people rub alcohol gels on their hands long enough for them to work.</p>
<p>“It's not just the product, it's the actual friction of when you're rubbing your hands and getting all of it on your skin for it to actually work,” he said. “So, should it work for a virus like H1N1? As far as we know, yes, but only if you use it properly.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tennis pair aces a medal for Manitoba - Doubles bronze in men's event 'feels awesome'</b>
</div><div>By Paul Wiecek   </div>

</p>
<p>An embattled Manitoba tennis team, medal-less and playing without a team member who was quarantined with what proved to be a non-existent case of the H1N1 flu, finally got some good news at the Canada Games in Prince Edward Island on Thursday.</p>
<p>Team members Sean Bailey and Chad Lacap won bronze for Manitoba in the men's doubles event, the first medal of the Games for the Manitoba tennis team and just the second of any kind for Manitoba in P.E.I. Triathlete Sarah-Anne Brault won silver for Manitoba on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Bailey, 17, and Lacap, 15, defeated Alberta in straight sets, 6-3, 6-3, to capture the bronze.</p>
<p>"It feels awesome," said Lacap, who's going into Grade 11 at Maples Collegiate next month. "We stuck to our game plan. We played it tough."</p>
<p>Lacap and Bailey have been practice partners at the Winnipeg Winter Club for the past five years, but Bailey said the two had been playing doubles together only since being selected for Manitoba's Games team barely a month ago.</p>
<p>"We're pretty comfortable with each other," said Bailey.</p>
<p>Thursday's bronze medal was a bit of a going-away present for Bailey, who begins first-year classes next week at Tennessee's Austin Peay State University, an NCAA Division 1 school.</p>
<p>Bailey, a graduate of Miles Mac, will be attending on a tennis scholarship. "I'm pretty pumped," he said. "I come home for a day and then I have to leave right away because classes begin Aug. 27. "Tennis has been pretty good to me."</p>
<p>It hasn't been so good for the rest of the Manitoba tennis team, however. The team has been shut out of the medals except for the lone bronze and on top of that, player Muzeen Ismath was quarantined in P.E.I. this week with a possible case of H1N1 flu. Ismath was released Thursday night after the test results came back negative.</p>
<p>A Manitoba team official said Thursday that Bailey and Lacap had both been forbidden to discuss their stricken teammate.</p>
<p>Manitoba's medal tally of two has the province way down in the medal standings in P.E.I. Quebec is dominating the competition with 32 medals, including 10 gold, followed by B.C. with 21 medals and Ontario with 20.</p>
<p>Manitoba's medal tally of two puts the province in seventh place, two medals behind sixth-place Saskatchewan and one ahead of New Brunswick.</p>
<p>Newfoundland, Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon and P.E.I. have all yet to medal.</p>
<p>Manitoba was shut out in rowing finals on Thursday but has three more chances to medal in finals today. Both the province's beach volleyball teams will also play in bronze-medal games today.</p>
<p>The province's softball team will play in the page playoff 3 vs. 4 game today against Quebec after finishing the round-robin alone in third place at 7-2.</p>
<p>The winner of Manitoba-Quebec will play the loser of today's 1 vs. 2 game between B.C. and Ontario in the semi-final Saturday. The winner of that game will then advance to the final to play the winner of B.C.-Ontario.</p>

<p>A 17-year-old Winnipeg tennis player quarantined this week at the Canada Games in Prince Edward Island over concerns he might have had H1N1 influenza was abruptly released Thursday night after test results proved negative.</p>
<p>"We got the call, were told it was negative and that we should come pick him up," said Team Manitoba manager Barry Moroz.</p>
<p>"It wasn't H1N1."</p>
<p>Tennis player Muzeen Ismath, who plays out of the Tuxedo Tennis Club, was withdrawn from competition and quarantined Wednesday after he complained of a high fever and other flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The revelation that Ismath was negative came after a day that saw Manitoba and Games officials in PEI do their best to downplay the story. After being extraordinarily forthcoming with information on the Ismath case on Wednesday, Team Manitoba officials sought to contain the story on Thursday.</p>
<p>Moroz said team officials would have no further comment on the case, a request to interview Ismath was denied and other players on the Manitoba team had been forbidden to discuss the case.</p>
<p>"We're going to wait until the results come out before we have any more comment," Moroz said earlier in the day. "It's not a big issue. There's no real story here.</p>
<p>"If everything's OK, which it probably will be because he seems to be fine now, then he probably just had a touch of a bug of some kind."</p>
<p>Moroz said there have been no other reports of any other players or officials with Team Manitoba getting sick. And he noted that two of Ismath's teammates on the Manitoba tennis team -- Sean Bailey and Chad Lacap -- won bronze in men's doubles in PEI Thursday, only the second medal of any kind for Manitoba at that point.</p>
<p>While a team official informed a reporter the two players would have no comment on the Ismath case, Bailey did describe a team that had rallied together since Ismath was withdrawn from competition and quarantined on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We've had to make up for it, but we've all been really supportive of each other -- probably the most out of all the provinces," said Bailey.</p>

</p>
<p>This is a column about my mom, and the crazy things that can happen when you take ill at 83.</p>
<p>My mother is a retired nurse who has done everything right in terms of looking after her health all these years. Despite mobility challenges since being hit by a car in a crosswalk seven years ago, she's still very much a "tough old broad," as a friend once described her.</p>
<p>But as our family has now come to see, in the eyes of our depersonalized and harried health-care system, she's just Old Person No. 347,050 on a very long list. And from what she's been hearing from her friends, that's just how it is once you cross some invisible line into old age.</p>
<p>She has no chronic health conditions. She isn't on any long-term medication. Up until two months ago, she was travelling, cooking dinner for one friend or another virtually every night she was home and was an active, engaged community volunteer.</p>
<p>Then we went on a family holiday to Tofino in June. She got too much sun one day and went to bed feeling sick. Perhaps she slept too heavily on her bad arm -- the accident left her with a broken shoulder and severe limitations in the use of her right arm. At any rate, she awoke the next day with major pain in her arm.</p>
<p>It's been one strange ride ever since, starting with the prescription drug she was given to reduce inflammation -- which lived up to its potential to cause "a general feeling of illness" as one of its side-effects.</p>
<p>By the time she figured that out and quit the drug, she had developed blood-sugar problems and was showing diabetes-like symptoms. (With any luck, that was a side-effect of the drug as well, because they've since stopped.)</p>
<p>And wouldn't you know it, my mother's trusted family doctor retired just as all of this got underway. That put her into the care of the doctor who'd just bought the practice.</p>
<p>They'd never met before my mother came in about the pain in her arm. The physician knew nothing of the vigorous, active woman my mother had been just a few days earlier, and didn't bother to ask. I'm guessing the doctor just saw a tired, sick 83-year-old with a bum shoulder -- one who had yet to come to grips with her pain and illness as the byproducts of aging.</p>
<p>OK, I get that. So does my mom. She recognizes that she's in the countdown. She won't be looking for medical heroics when her time comes.</p>
<p>But there's a fine line between expecting people to accept the aging process and relegating them to assembly-line care that presumes they'll soon be dead anyway. That's how it has felt for my mother these past two months.</p>
<p>Her saga was complicated by a much-anticipated cruise to Alaska in late June, which she desperately wanted to go on. The X-ray of her shoulder found nothing untoward and the doctors didn't seem too interested in exploring the issue further, so she mustered her strength to go on the cruise. She still didn't know whether the diabetes-like problems she'd experienced were a reaction to the anti-inflammatory she'd taken, but figured results from the blood-sugar tests would be ready when she returned.</p>
<p>And they were. But by then she had caught some terrible flu-like thing that had morphed into a secondary bronchial infection, as had her sister on the final days of the cruise. (Could it be swine flu? My mother is on Day 21 of what she describes as the worst illness of her life and nobody has even suggested she be tested for it.)</p>
<p>So the bronchial infection was the more pressing issue by the time she got home. In B.C., you're only allowed one health concern per doctor visit these days, which meant her doctor listened to her chest but then refused to review her blood-sugar results until a later appointment.</p>
<p>Her active life has ground to a halt over the past two months. Depression crept in. Fortunately, all those friends she cooks for have come through for her.</p>
<p>And the really good news is that so much time has passed since her arm first started to hurt that the original problem appears to have resolved itself. I think she's going to be fine.</p>
<p>I wouldn't say the system failed her; she got drugs, tests and an X-ray. But all of it came grudgingly, as if done just to silence a frail old lady who hadn't come to grips with her own mortality. Come on, docs -- look past those aging bodies to the people who are still very much alive inside them.</p>

</p>
<p>Prime Minister Harper is visiting the Arctic this week. The weekend preceding his visit, a photo was taken of two 10-year-old boys sleeping outside a local supermarket. It was 6:30 a.m. and one of the boys was wearing shorts.</p>
<p>The photo was carried across the country and brought to light the extent of social problems in Canada's North. However, before we conclude that this is an issue for Nunavut, we should take a long, hard look in our own backyard.</p>
<p>Aboriginal communities across Canada, but more so in remote areas, face serious social problems. High unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse coupled with poor living conditions have created a society in crisis.</p>
<p>And of course we have the lingering effects of the residential schools, which still cast a long shadow across Indian Country.</p>
<p>The heaviest burden falls on the young, as evidenced by the high rate of youth suicide. Our young people are committing suicide at a rate that's anywhere from five to six times that of the general population. One-third of all deaths of aboriginal youth aged 10 to 19 are attributable to suicide.</p>
<p>The rates vary regionally, but in all cases we have an epidemic on our hands. The suicide rate for Inuit youth is the highest in the world, at 11 times the national average.</p>
<p>This is a problem that our leaders would rather avoid. It's not upbeat, and it's not an issue based on land claims or treaty rights. It's a social problem that has a wide variety of roots and causes. It is not a simple problem with a quick fix.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Harper's response, while in the Arctic, was to focus on economic development programs. He thinks the crisis could be solved with the help of an economic development office.</p>
<p>To a certain extent he is right, although it's simplistic and naive thinking. The North needs economic development, but it can't be viewed in isolation. There is much more to it. In fact, I have known people who are hard working and self-sufficient who lost a child to suicide. The reasons are deeply embedded in our society.</p>
<p>We are living in a period of rapid social change, and not always for the better. Young people today are not speaking their mother language, so many of the old stories and teachings are not available to them. The outside culture has been introduced through television, and our people are on the outside looking in.</p>
<p>The worlds of Toronto, New York and California are far different from the one they inhabit. They are shown a world they may never join, but they look at their own world and perceive only emptiness.</p>
<p>Today, it's very hard to grow up as an aboriginal person. Young people face a world that is far different from that of their parents and grandparents. It is a world of diminishing opportunities, with pressure to succeed. It's also one dislocated from aboriginal language and culture, especially for urban youth.</p>
<p>Alienated young people are often depressed and vulnerable to addictions. Many self-medicate by turning to alcohol and drugs. Small issues become magnified. For example, the breakup with a girlfriend or boyfriend is a leading cause for suicide.</p>
<p>Young people who are already at risk find themselves overwhelmed by problems that all youth face at some time in their lives. Some can handle it while others fall into depression and opt for suicide.</p>
<p>Economic development sounds like a quick fix, but it's overused. However, it appeals to the elites in Indian Country. Economic development money goes to those in business, with the hope they will hire aboriginal people. Other programs such as suicide prevention, family counselling and youth counselling services are regarded as pedestrian and get overlooked.</p>
<p>In fact, suicide prevention is a complicated issue. Its roots are in the families, communities and society as a whole. The effect of suicide on the families is devastating. Parents are racked with guilt and pain, friends suffer the loss, and over the course of the year, teachers deal with the loss of several students.</p>
<p>Some communities have experienced the loss of one community member on average each month. This constant mourning can drive a whole community into shock and depression.</p>
<p>But when one considers that suicide is the cause of death for one-third of our young people, it can't be ignored. If suicide were a disease, it would be considered an epidemic in our community and medical resources would be brought in.</p>
<p>At the moment there is a lot of concern about the H1N1 virus and the threat it poses to aboriginal communities. Health professionals are warning that the flu could harm the aboriginal population chiefly because of poor living conditions and overcrowding.</p>
<p>The H1N1 outbreak will have passed in a few months, but suicide will continue to be the epidemic that most threatens Canada's aboriginal people. The elephant remains in the room.</p>

<p>Re: Health Minister Urges Pandemic Preparedness, Aug. 20.</p>
<p>I am somewhat baffled by all the coverage about the coming swine flu (H1N1) pandemic. It is already here and it has been here for some time. Here's the kicker, we don't know how many cases we have here in Ontario because the labs have been directed by Public Health Ontario not to test anyone unless they are under two or over 65.</p>
<p>I had a patient in my office about a month ago whose classmate was tested and found to be positive. I did the appropriate swab and received a reply back in two days from the lab that the test had been cancelled because the patient did not meet the age criteria set forth in the memo.</p>
<p>Can anyone figure out why the Ontario government might not want to alarm people with rising swine flu numbers during the busy summer tourist season? I can't either.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Feds set flu protocol for schools; Handwashing among strict guidelines</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>

</p>
<p>Schools and daycares are being urged by the federal government to promptly isolate children who fall ill with flu-like symptoms, step up cleaning protocols and add more handwashing stations as part of pandemic preparedness and response plans.</p>
<p>Those are among the guidelines issued Wednesday from the Public Health Agency of Canada aimed at child care centres, elementary and high schools, boarding schools and post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said when students and faculty return to school in a few weeks, it's "crucial" that they are prepared for a potential second wave of the swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"Schools and child care programs in particular are known settings for influenza transmission. However, these institutions also have the ability to identify potential H1N1 activity and with the help of these documents, can implement measures to limit transmission," she said in a call with reporters.</p>
<p>It was the end of the school year when the swine flu pandemic hit Canada and since then, schools have been fine-tuning their plans to be ready in the event the pandemic gets worse in the fall.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said institutions should consult the new guidelines when developing their plans.</p>
<p>Classrooms are "high activity areas" for any kind of virus, not just influenza, because children have less resistance than adults and are able to spread infections more easily, he told reporters.</p>
<p>The most important factors in controlling the spread of swine flu in schools, according to the documents, are identifying sick students or staff as early as possible, removing them from the classroom if they have symptoms, practising coughing and sneezing etiquette and frequent hand cleaning.</p>
<p>While measures to prevent, monitor and respond to the swine flu will vary from school board to school board, the federal guidelines provide a preview of the kinds of things parents and teachers can expect when school resumes in September.</p>
<p>Schools are being told, for example, to establish protocols for reporting above-average absenteeism to local public health officials and teachers should be on the lookout daily for flu symptoms among students.</p>
<p>A number of recommendations relate to the isolation of children who become sick while at school: schools and day-care centres should be prepared to promptly isolate children who show symptoms in a separate room until they can be picked up; the sick child should stay two metres away from other students; sick children should not travel home on school buses, but if there is no alternative, they should sit alone and with a tissue to cover their nose and mouth.</p>
<p>Parents are advised to keep their child away from school until there are no more symptoms, the guidelines said.</p>
<p>Preventing transmission in schools will also depend on how clean the facilities are and if the federal guidelines are followed, cleaning staff will be very busy this fall.</p>

</p>
<p>The number of Canadians and Americans travelling across the border plunged in June, an indication that new passport rules that came into effect on June 1 are slowing traffic on both sides.</p>
<p>The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative requires all travellers, including U.S. residents, to have a passport, a NEXUS card (a pre-approved travel document for low-risk travellers) or a biometric driver's licence in order to enter the United States.</p>
<p>The number of Canadians visiting the U.S. fell 9.6 per cent in June from May, Statistics Canada said, while the number of Americans crossing the border into Canada dropped 15.6 per cent.</p>
<p>Overnight travel to Canada by U.S. residents declined 9.3 per cent in June, but the most staggering number was the 26.2 per cent decline in same-day car travel.</p>
<p>"Our business was down 44 per cent on June 1 from the year before," said Tim Ruddy, vice-president of the company that runs the famed Maid of the Mist tour boat in Niagara Falls, Ont. "It was like somebody flipped a switch."</p>
<p>Ruddy said several factors are affecting business, including the economy and the H1N1 flu, but the passport issue is compounding the problem.</p>
<p>About 50 per cent of Canadians and 30 per cent of Americans have a passport, according to Randy Williams, CEO of the Tourism Industry Association of Canada.</p>
<p>He agreed that the depressed visitor numbers are a reflection of the new travel restrictions.</p>
<p>"The days when we had 43 million visitors from the U.S. like we had in 2002 are over," he said.</p>
<p>Williams's organization is predicting an eight to 10 per cent drop in tourism revenues this year, representing a large chunk of a $75 billion industry.</p>
<p>In the other direction, overnight visits by Canadians to the U.S. fell 4.9 per cent in June to 1.4 million trips, and same-day trips were down 13.2 per cent to 1.5 million.</p>
<p>While some factors that affect travel will likely improve, Ruddy said the passport issue is here for a long time.</p>
<p>"We see the economy and H1N1 improving," he said. "But I think it will be a generation before we see U.S. residents getting a passport as a regular step in their lives."</p>

</div><div>Hanneke Brooymans </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>767 words</div><div>20 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal </div>
</p>
<p>A new study shows the H1N1 virus spreads at the same relatively slow rate as SARS and other influenza viruses, offering some reassurance to scientists about the potential of preventing a widespread outbreak.</p>
<p>The transmissibility of the virus was determined by looking at data from the spread of the virus in Mexico City, said Babak Pourbohloul of the University of British Columbia Centre for Disease Control. Pourbohloul was the lead author of the study, published Tuesday in the online version of the academic journal Influenza and Other Respiratory Viruses.</p>
<p>The study says the 2009 pandemic virus appears to be less transmissible than the fall wave of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed millions.</p>
<p>"An estimation of this value at the early stage of an outbreak, specifically for an emerging infection, is very important, it's really key," Pourbohloul said in an interview.</p>
<p>"It will provide guidance to policy-makers as to what intervention strategy they could use in order to effectively contain the infection."</p>
<p>It's not known if the virus will mutate, allowing it to spread more easily.</p>
<p>"It's not easy to predict the timing" of mutation," he said. "It might happen in October, it might happen in November, it might not happen at all."</p>
<p>But it's one possible scenario among many that Pourbohloul has to consider.</p>
<p>As director of mathematical modelling at the Centre for Disease Control, Pourbohloul and his team are using models to evaluate the effectiveness of various public health intervention strategies--everything from targeted school closings to mass immunization and quarantines.</p>
<p>They will be able to provide the Canadian government and provincial health agencies with their advice in four to six weeks, he said.</p>
<p>Pourbohloul said he is under pressure to arrive at his results as quickly as possible. "We understand every policy should be decided on and applied within two or three months."</p>
<p>But offering accurate predictions means a lot of computer simulations need to be run and that takes time, he said.</p>
<p>Pourbohloul said timing is really important when considering intervention strategies.</p>
<p>"For instance, if it's really at the beginning of the epidemic or outbreak, the kind of interventions one would use would be different from the ones when the epidemic is rampant in the population."</p>
<p>School closings, proper hygiene and social distancing might be a good idea at the beginning of an epidemic. "But when the epidemic becomes rampant, then more drastic measures should be taken," he added.</p>
<p>While the H1N1 virus has a similar transmissibility rate as SARS, it doesn't have the same fatality rate of more than 10 per cent, he said. It is harder to detect, though, since a larger number of people with the virus show no symptoms. This means H1N1 will need different containment strategies than SARS.</p>
<p>Ideally, the vaccine currently under development would be available before a second wave of the virus hits.</p>
<p>If there is a fresh wave of more numerous cases, it would happen when the virus has mutated to allow a more rapid spread. When this will happen is the "$1-million question," Pourbohloul said. It would be less problematic if it happened after the vaccine arrived.</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer of health said earlier this week that a vaccine will be available in mid-November. The province said it won't announce until mid-September which groups will be targeted as priorities for the vaccine.</p>
<p>In the United States, a vaccine is expected to be available in mid-October, said Tom Skinner, a spokesman with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>
<p>"Until that time, we've just got to do what we can to educate people about the steps they can take to protect themselves," he said.</p>
<p>A CDC advisory committee has already recommended which groups, such as pregnant women and health-care workers, should receive priority if for some reason access to the vaccine is limited at first.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen anything based on the epidemiology to date that the attack rate for this particular virus is much different than what we see for seasonal flu viruses," Skinner said.</p>
<p>"Of course, it appears to be affecting younger people ... So that's different than what we see with some seasonal flu viruses that tend to affect the elderly more."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Should kids be vaccinated this fall?; Pediatrician answers parents' questions</b>
</div><div>Elise Stolte </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1436 words</div><div>20 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal </div>
</p>
<p>Parents will have to decide this fall whether to get their children vaccinated against H1N1, and whether to send them to school if other students are getting sick.</p>
<p>Pediatrician Dr. Henry Pabst tested vaccines and taught immunology and pediatrics at the University of Alberta for nearly 30 years, before retiring to work directly with children again at the Misericordia Hospital. He sat down with The Journal this week to answer questions that may be on many parents'minds.</p>
<p>WHAT ARE PARENTS' MAIN CONCERNS?</p>
<p>Mostly they ask if vaccination with a foreign material is useful at all. In the late '80s, early '90s, studies came out that measles vaccines might be linked to autism, but it's been amply proven to be not true. It was just a big disclaimer in various publications, but it still spooks people who say, 'I don't want to give a foreign material to my child.' Well, the foreign material is around us all the time, as soon as a child sticks something in his mouth, and far worse are all the chemicals in the environment around them.</p>
<p>WHAT ABOUT CONCERNS THEY MIGHT GET SICK FROM THE VACCINE?</p>
<p>That happens occasionally, but you know the vast majority of people don't seem to be affected. The vaccine itself is a killed vaccine and it's not going to cause any disease by itself. Yes, there are side-effects, and in so many million doses, you can get significant side-effects like neuropathy, getting a nervous paralysis of the peripheral nerves. But because of the severity of influenza itself, it's a small risk to take in most people's opinion.</p>
<p>WHAT IF I'M A HEALTHY PERSON AND COULD TRUST MY OWN IMMUNE SYSTEM TO FIGHT OFF THE FLU?WOULD YOU STILL RECOMMEND I TAKE THE VACCINE?</p>
<p>You can trust your immune system all you like, but if you do get influenza, it's quite a significant disease. I had it 12 or 15 years ago at a conference in Vancouver, late in the season, and I was sicker than a dog for two or three days. Yes, you can stay at home and avoid spreading it. But you'll still get sick, and if you're susceptible to problems from other illnesses, cystic fibrosis or some preexisting lung disease, then complications can be very miserable, if not death. Thousands of people die every year from the flu, and it's not just people with a complicated (health) background.</p>
<p>WE'VE HEARD OF A STUDY THAT THE NUMBER OF HEALTH-CARE PROFESSIONALS WHO DON'T GET VACCINATED IS ACTUALLY QUITE HIGH. WHY MIGHT PEOPLE OBJECT TO GETTING THE VACCINE?</p>
<p>Well, I don't know what the percentage is, but some people avoid getting the shot because they think they are above the common crowd, and maybe they figure they will deal with it by themselves. But I mean, that's a foolish attitude. We scratch our heads sometimes.</p>
<p>WE'VE HEARD DISCUSSIONS THAT MOST OF THE BENEFITS FROM A MASS IMMUNIZATION ARE SOCIETAL, WHILE THE RISKS ARE ALL INDIVIDUAL. CAN YOU TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS?</p>
<p>Well, that's philosophical; society versus the individual. We're living in a dense society here and it makes sense for the individual to belong to that society and get protected together with everyone else. Well, with most people. Occasionally, you get a society where most people are immunized, but some avoid it. Big surprise if these un-immunized people all of a sudden get the illness that they thought they could avoid by just hiding in the rest of the crowd. You can't deny that the principle is true, but people who do not get immunized cut their own flesh, essentially.</p>
<p>DO YOU THINK THE PROVINCE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS GETTING ENOUGH PEOPLE IMMUNIZED THIS FALL?</p>
<p>I don't think so. I think the push by public health and by the government agencies is so strong that the majority of people will probably get immunized. And I think the H1N1 development has scared enough people. There has been a tremendous change in societal attitude toward flu vaccine. Ten years ago or so, here in Edmonton at least, it was something few people got. But over the last few years I've noticed the immunization clinics, which are held by the public health clinic every fall, have been attended increasingly well, especially last year.</p>
<p>WHAT DO YOU THINK IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CHANGE?</p>
<p>Advertising. I think, advertising and pieces in the media talking about significant cases and recalling some of the complications.</p>
<p>IF I GET THE FLU VACCINE ONE YEAR, DOES IT MEAN I HAVE TO GET IT EVERY YEAR?</p>
<p>No, you don't have to get it every year, but it's a good idea because flu vaccine is something very specific for that season.</p>
<p>ARE THE RISKS OF COMPLICATIONS MORE SEVERE FOR CHILDREN?</p>
<p>Not that I know of. They get a slightly lower dose, and it's a killed vaccine, so you're not getting the illness from the vaccine.</p>
<p>I ASSUME THE VACCINE IS USELESS AFTER I'VE BEEN EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS. IF A FAMILY MEMBER HAS ALREADY BEEN SICK, DOES THAT MEAN I DON'T NEED TO GET THE VACCINE?</p>
<p>It's difficult to say. If you're already sick with it, the vaccine is not going to help you that particular season. Individual one has the disease, Number 2 has contact with Number 1. So Number 3 thinks he's already incubating it. It might be true, but not necessarily. If I was Number 3, I would still take the vaccine.</p>
<p>DO I HAVE TO GET THE VACCINE? CAN'T I JUST WASH MY HANDS AND STAY OUT OF CROWDS?</p>
<p>Well, that helps of course. Keep clean and keep your nose out of the crowd, but it's not the whole story. It's much better to do both.</p>
<p>COULD IT BE TOO LATE IN NOVEMBER?</p>
<p>It could be too late, too late for some people. But certainly not too late for the majority of people. The majority of people probably wouldn't be in contact with the virus until December or January. My experience (getting sick) has been so significant that I am very much convinced a flu vaccine is a good thing to have on your side.</p>
<p>IF YOU HAD A CHILD WHO WAS GOING TO ELEMENTARY SCHOOL, AND YOU KNEW SEVERAL OF THEIR CLASSMATES HAD COME DOWN WITH H1N1 AT SCHOOL, WOULD YOU STILL SEND YOUR CHILD TO SCHOOL?</p>
<p>That's a difficult question. It's difficult to know if those friends really had H1N1 or had something else. I might keep my child at home, certainly if the child has an underlying chronic condition like cystic fibrosis or diabetes. But of course, most likely I would have had the child immunized to begin with, and then I might not be quite as concerned about it.</p>
<p>THE MEDICAL OFFICER OF HEALTH WAS SAYING THAT CLOSING SCHOOLS IS NOT THE BEST SOLUTION TO CONTAINING THE VIRUS.</p>
<p>Well, I suspect he's probably thinking that there could be thousands of children roaming the streets, possibly becoming a nuisance because they can't go to school. I don't think public policy would be to keep the children out of school because of H1N1.</p>
<p>BUT YOU'RE SAYING YOU MIGHT DO IT FOR YOUR OWN CHILDREN?</p>
<p>I might do it for my own child, but I would keep the child at home.</p>
<p>CAN I STILL GET THE FLU IF I GET THE VACCINE?</p>
<p>Yes, that's the other principle I forgot to mention early on. No vaccine immunizes everyone 100 per cent. There are always some escapees, whatever the reason may be, biological, technical or whatever. It's possible to get the flu, but most likely in a mild form.</p>
<p>ANYTHING ELSE THAT YOUR PATIENTS OFTEN ASK YOU?</p>
<p>Should I immunize a small child, 10 months old or a year old?The answer is yes. They get a small dose, a reduced dose, but yes, for sure. Because with H1N1, studies have shown younger people are much more susceptible to the ill effects than my generation, people over the age of 50.Possibly because we've had immunization for many years and have been in contact with influenza strains for many years, we have a basic immunity.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Isolate children with flu-like symptoms, Ottawa urges</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>388 words</div><div>20 August 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Schools and daycares are being urged by the federal government to promptly isolate children who fall ill with flu-like symptoms, step up cleaning protocols and add more hand washing stations as part of pandemic preparedness and response plans.</p>
<p>Those are among the guidelines issued yesterday from the Public Health Agency of Canada aimed at childcare centres, elementary and high schools, boarding schools and post-secondary institutions.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said when students and faculty return to school in a few weeks, it's "crucial" that they are prepared for a potential second wave of the swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"Schools and childcare programs in particular are known settings for influenza transmission. However, these institutions also have the ability to identify potential H1N1 activity and with the help of these documents can implement measures to limit transmission," she said.</p>
<p>It was the end of the school year when the swine flu pandemic hit Canada and since then schools have been fine-tuning their plans to be ready in the event the pandemic gets worse in the fall.</p>
<p>Chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said institutions should consult the new guidelines when developing their plans.</p>
<p>Classrooms are "high activity areas" for any kind of virus, not just influenza, because children have less resistance than adults and are able to spread infections more easily, he told reporters.</p>
<p>The most important factors in controlling the spread of swine flu in schools, according to the documents, are identifying sick students or staff as early as possible, removing them from the classroom if they have symptoms, practising coughing and sneezing etiquette and frequent hand cleaning.</p>
<p>While measures to prevent, monitor and respond to the swine flu will vary from school board to school board, the federal guidelines provide a preview of the kinds of things parents and teachers can expect when school resumes in September.</p>
<p>Schools are being told, for example, to establish protocols for reporting above-average absenteeism to local public health officials and teachers should be on the lookout daily for flu symptoms among students.Parents are advised to keep their child away from school until there are no more symptoms, the Public Health Agency of Canada guidelines say.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No new guidelines for H1N1: Quebec; Though next wave could be deadlier. To date, swine flu has proved to be far less severe than initially feared, province's health minister says</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>559 words</div><div>20 August 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Quebec has decided against issuing new pandemic flu guidelines even though public-health authorities predict a second, perhaps deadlier wave of H1N1 infections might sweep North America as early as this fall.</p>
<p>The government is basing its decision on the fact that to date the swine flu has proved to be far less severe than initially feared, Health Minister Yves Bolduc told reporters yesterday.</p>
<p>"The message we have from (the Public Health Department) is that we have had a very low level of H1N1 infections," Bolduc said. "The peak has passed.</p>
<p>"We have to be prudent," he added, "but on the other hand, we can't close schools or put into practice measures that defy common sense."</p>
<p>As of Monday, laboratory tests have confirmed a total of 2,666 cases of H1N1 infections in Quebec. Of that number, there have been 24 deaths - all involving people already at risk.</p>
<p>The Quebec death rate thus far is nine-tenths of one per cent, exactly in line with the global rate. During a typical flu season, the mortality rate is one-tenth of one per cent.</p>
<p>Horacio Arruda, director of the protection branch of the Quebec Public Health Department, urged Quebecers to remain vigilant. He recommended that people wash their hands frequently and cough into their elbows. Those who are sick with the flu should stay at home.</p>
<p>Those considered at risk are infants under 2 years old, those suffering from chronic disease like diabetes, people over the age of 60 and pregnant women, especially those in their second and third trimesters. If anyone in those groups falls ill with flu symptoms, they should see a doctor, Arruda advised. And since the death of a 23-year-old pregnant woman from H1N1 on Aug. 14, Arruda noted that hospitals have changed their practice slightly. Should a pregnant woman be hospitalized with H1N1, the medical staff will treat the patient with anti-viral drugs immediately, judging that the benefits of the medications outweigh the potential risks.</p>
<p>As for schools and daycares, there is no reason to close them, Arruda said. "If the epidemiological situation changes and becomes more severe, we would then change our opinion," he added.</p>
<p>Some school boards have decided that all their pregnant staff should go on preventive maternity leave. Arruda said that is not the government policy and suggested that each case be assessed on its merits in consultation with a doctor.</p>
<p>Quebec will launch an inoculation campaign to protect against H1N1 once the vaccine becomes available, probably by December or January. That could coincide with the start or middle of the second wave of H1N1 infections. Arruda said he plans to attend a federal meeting on the H1N1 vaccine to determine exactly when it will be ready.</p>
<p>In the first weeks of the H1N1 pandemic, the new virus appeared to be no deadlier than the seasonal flu. It's now viewed as a little more severe than the seasonal flu, but far less deadly than flu viruses in major pandemics. H1N1 has also been shown to infect a disproportionately larger number of adolescents and young adults.</p>

<p>Diabetes drug Avandia under attack by doctors</p>
<p>A group of Toronto researchers is calling into question the continued use of the controversial diabetes drug Avandia, saying a competing drug in the same class is as effective and less dangerous.</p>
<p>The scientists, from Toronto's Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences, say people taking Actos for Type 2 diabetes are 23 per cent less likely to be hospitalized for heart failure. They are also 14 per cent less likely to die than people taking Avandia.</p>
<p>Dr. David Juurlink says he can't imagine why a patient would want to take Avandia or a doctor would want to prescribe it.</p>
<p>Avandia, which is made by GlaxoSmithKline, has been under fire since a review paper published in 2007 said the drug increases the risk of heart attack.</p>
<p>GSK disputes the more recent findings, saying other studies have determined Avandia is an appropriate diabetes drug for appropriate patients.</p>
<p>Health-care providers urged to get flu shot</p>
<p>The organization representing Canada's doctors is urging physicians to roll up their own sleeves for a flu shot.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association has passed a resolution encouraging all physicians and other health-care providers to be immunized for influenza annually.</p>
<p>Dr. Rhonda Church, who tabled the motion at the association's annual meeting, says studies show that health-care workers are among those with the lowest influenza vaccination rates.</p>
<p>Church says that needs to change if the country faces a swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Association president Dr. Robert Ouellet says the group is pushing doctors to get vaccinated, but he says doctors can't be forced to get the shot.</p>
<p>Drugmaker has flu shot without the shot</p>
<p>Drug giant AstraZeneca is hoping to bring its needle-free flu vaccine to Canada.</p>
<p>The company says it has applied to Health Canada for a licence to sell the vaccine FluMist in this country.</p>
<p>FluMist, which is made of weakened live flu viruses, is administered by way of a nasal spray.</p>
<p>In the United States, where FluMist has been on the market for a number of years, the vaccine is licensed for use in children and adults aged two years to 49 years.</p>
<p>Marc Zarenda, AstraZeneca Canada's scientific director for oncology and infection, says the company's licence submission included data from 73 clinical trials involving 141,000 participants.</p>
<p>He says the company hopes to be able to sell FluMist in Canada for the 2010-11 flu season.</p>
<p>Young couch potatoes risk high blood pressure</p>
<p>A new study suggests young children who spend too much time in front of the television, the computer and video games might be at increased risk for high blood pressure.</p>
<p>American and Spanish researchers examined the association between sedentary behaviour and blood pressure in 111 children aged three to eight.</p>
<p>They found children with the lowest amount of screen time had lower levels of systolic and diastolic blood pressure than kids with the highest amounts of screen time.</p>

</p>
<p>What can I do to prevent H1N1 virus?</p>
<p>Receiving the vaccine when it becomes available--most likely in November--will be a good first step.</p>
<p>But any vaccine is only between 60 and 75 per cent effective, says Dr. Allan Ronald.</p>
<p>Everyday measures that Canadians should take include washing hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes and staying home when ill.</p>
<p>Will a face mask prevent catching the virus?</p>
<p>No. Masks have been shown to be ineffective when it comes to protecting against H1N1 and may actually increase your odds of contracting it, as it's possible to contaminate the mask when you're putting it on or taking it off.</p>
<p>The exception to the mask rule, says the organization, is people who have H1N1--they should wear one to protect those in close contact.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms to watch for?</p>
<p>Symptoms are similar to those of seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>They include fever, cough, fatigue, muscle aches, lack of appetite and, occasionally, a runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Should I take antivirals, such as Tamiflu or Relenza, to prevent the flu?</p>
<p>No. PHAC is recommending that antivirals be used to treat H1N1 only when the illness is moderate to severe--not for treating mild cases or for prevention.</p>
<p>If I get the flu, what should I do?</p>
<p>Rest, avoid contact with others and drink lots of fluids, suggests Alberta Health and Wellness. Consider using lozenges, nose drops and a warm salt water gargle.</p>
<p>If your symptoms are severe, talk to a health professional.</p>

<p>Fighting The Flu</p>

<p>Tuesday: School preparedness</p>
<p>Wednesday: Protecting the most vulnerable</p>
<p>Thursday: The flu and you</p>
<p>Friday: Business girds for H1N1</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Michelle MacDonald has witnessed the damage that H1N1 can inflict.</p>
<p>At the end of May, her Ontario-based sister -- an otherwise healthy, strong, 38-year-old Grade 1 teacher -- contracted the virus also known as swine flu.</p>
<p>Doctors misdiagnosed the flu a few times, believing it was, at worst, a bad pneumonia.</p>
<p>After doctors nailed the diagnosis, MacDonald's sister was put on Tamiflu, the antiviral drug.</p>
<p>But things got worse.</p>
<p>Not only was she fighting H1N1 and in a drug-induced coma, but the virus ended up triggering a severe lung disease called adult respiratory distress syndrome.</p>
<p>"We honestly didn't know if she would make it," says MacDonald, a 37-year-old stay-at-home Calgary mom.</p>
<p>"It was so scary. Nothing like that had ever happened to our family before."</p>
<p>Her sister survived.</p>
<p>MacDonald is eager to share her sister's story--not to scare anyone, but rather in the hopes that people will learn more about H1N1 and take steps to protect themselves, their families and others.</p>
<p>"I honestly don't think there's enough information out there about it," she says.</p>
<p>"I don't think people have any idea of the extent of what could happen."</p>
<p>The good news, according to experts, is that the majority of H1N1 cases are not severe.</p>
<p>Dr. Allan Ronald, scientific adviser to the Winnipeg-based International Centre for Infectious Diseases, says that H1N1 is similar to seasonal influenza, in that most people experience a three-to five-day illness that is mild to moderate.</p>
<p>Most people recover on their own, without antiviral drugs, within a week. Only five to 10 per cent have an illness that lasts several weeks, he says.</p>
<p>Just how concerned about contracting the virus should the average person be?</p>
<p>"We expect H1N1 to be the predominant flu strain this coming season," says Ronald, adding that flu season typically kicks up in October but can start as late as January.</p>
<p>"But we could be wrong. Whether it will cause the same illness it caused in May and June of this year, or whether it will be worse because it's going to be the flu season, we're not sure."</p>
<p>If you are a healthy, nonsmoking hard to know if it's just a common adult with no risk factors of any kind--which include being pregnant, obese, having asthma, cancer, or heart and lung disease --Ronald says your chances of being hospitalized, if you catch the flu in the first place, " are slim.</p>
<p>Still, there are precautions that everyone should take, he says.</p>
<p>Because H1N1 spreads even faster than regular influenza --each sick person typically infects two other people, as opposed to the usual 1.5--it's important to stay home the first day you have a sore throat, runny nose and a fever of more than 38 C, says Ronald.</p>
<p>Aches, pains and a fever typically indicate a flu, as opposed to a cold.</p>
<p>"As it starts, it's going to be</p>
<p>cold or not," he says, but Ronald urges people to err on the side of caution.</p>
<p>"In the midst of an H1N1 epidemic, very early on you should phone in to work and say, 'I think I'm getting the influenza.'</p>
<p>And as for preventing the flu in the first place, Ronald says there is no official recommendation as of yet, but what he'll suggest is that people receive the regular seasonal flu shot in October, as well as the H1N1 vaccine as soon as it's available.</p>
<p>More answers to some commonly asked questions regarding H1N1 are outlined below.</p>
<p>As for MacDonald's sister, she spent some 40 days in the hospital;she weathered everything from the coma and relying on a ventilator to losing nearly 40 pounds of muscle and the ability to walk.</p>
<p>MacDonald travelled to Ontario twice--when her sister fell ill and when she left the hospital--and says her sibling is on a slow recovery.</p>
<p>She can walk now and is getting stronger, but relies on daily naps for energy.</p>
<p>She is often short of breath, as her lungs are working at only 40 per cent capacity; there are no guarantees she'll get back to 100 per cent lung capacity, but they're optimistic she'll improve in the coming months.</p>
<p>"Overall, she's doing wonderfully," says MacDonald.</p>
<p>"We're so happy that she's OK."</p>

<p>WHITECAP EARNS BUNDESLIGA TRIAL</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- Whitecaps defender/midfielder Ethan Gage has joined the U-23 side of German Bundesliga club Eintracht Frankfurt on a two-week trial. An 18-year-old native of Cochrane, Alta., Gage, came up though the Whitecaps' residency program. He's made 21 appearances this season, including 12 starts, and scored the game-winning goal in the Whitecaps' 1-0 home win over Montreal in the Canadian championship.

<div id="hd"><b>Bailout will do little to improve pork industry</b>
</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div>
<div>392 words</div><div>20 August 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>It is about time for some rationalization of the Canadian pork industry. The challenge is to transform hog production into an efficient, profitable, and less-polluting industry delivering better pork, all without driving consumer prices sharply higher. Unfortunately, the $92 million over three years the federal government has just committed to the industry does not seem likely to move us much closer to that goal.</p>
<p>The industry, which wanted $800 million from Ottawa, is unhappy with what it got. But $92 million is more than many industries have had from government in this recession.</p>
<p>We know that agriculture is one of the sacred pigs, so to speak, of Canadian politics, along with the auto industry and aerospace. And it's especially important in Quebec, which produced 37 per cent of hogs slaughtered in Canada last year. But agriculture is cyclical.</p>
<p>The industry's own export-development agency, Canada Pork International, acknowledges a four-year North American price cycle. And recent headlines about the start of a strong economic rebound in Asia seem to promise revived export markets. Why, then, launch a three-year buyout program?</p>
<p>In fairness, we note that it has been a tough few years for hog farmers. High feed prices, an intermittently strong Canadian dollar, and the swine-flu scare have driven up costs, reduced exports, and weakened demand. U.S. "country-of-origin labeling" imposed another restraint on exports.</p>
<p>Before those setbacks, however, the industry had expanded rapidly in Canada, led by exports, which have doubled in the last decade.</p>
<p>Some of the new producers were bad neighbours, huge farms whose manure runoff damaged waterways and fouled the air.</p>
<p>Ottawa announced $75 million to buy out farmers, plus $17 million for market research abroad and consumer advertising at home. Most of the $75 million, we suspect, will go to small producers, with high unit costs, who will be most likely to leave the industry.</p>
<p>We regret that nothing in the announcement reveals any new effort to help producers develop domestic or foreign markets for organic, pasture-raised, eco-friendly, or unusual-breed pork, currently all rarities.</p>
<p>Pork is often cheap in supermarkets, but we suspect many Canadians would pay more for better flavour from better-raised animals.</p>
<p>At least it would be nice to have that option.</p>

<p>Ontario could win as many as three of the four singles and doubles individual tennis titles during the scheduled medal matches today in Charlottetown. Doubles player Douglas-Miron is part of that elite group with Katarena Paliivets of Toronto in girls' singles and Zach White of Vineland in boys' singles.</p>
<p>Douglas-Miron also will play in the girls' doubles match when Ontario meets Quebec in the gold-silver match of the mixed team event. Her doubles partner is Amy He of Burlington. They're both 15.</p>
<p>A student at Franco Cité High School who trains at Tennis Canada's national training centre in Montreal, Douglas-Miron and He advanced to the individual girls' doubles final Wednesday with a 6-3, 6-0 victory over Britt and Erika Voaklander of Edmonton. They'll face Quebec's Marie-Frederique Bédard of Île Bizard and Marianne Jodoin of Varennes in both the individual doubles gold-medal match and the mixed team event.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a lot of fun," Douglas-Miron said in a telephone interview. "We've worked hard to win all of our matches. I know the Quebec team and they're really strong. We will try our best to win both gold medals and bring them back to Ontario."</p>
<p>Douglas-Miron trains with Jodoin in Montreal.</p>
<p>Gloucester's Gabriela Dabrowski and Ottawa's Edward Nguyen lost their singles semifinals in straight sets. They were scheduled to play in the bronze medal matches today.</p>

Soosalu and Blumer posted a third and two seconds in the seventh, eighth and ninth races in Summerside, while second-place Tedmund Skiffington and Jonathan Reid of Nova Scotia won all three races.</p>
<p>After each team discarded its worst race result, Soosalu and Blumer were first for Ontario with 12 points, while Skiffington and Reid were second at 15.</p>
<p>Despite taking an elbow that resulted in three stitches over his right eyebrow after the game, Justin Shaver of Ottawa enjoyed his best game of the boys' basketball tournament as Ontario defeated New Brunswick 78-61 in the quarterfinals. In the semifinals, Ontario will meet Nova Scotia, which beat Saskatchewan 91-77.</p>
<p>"I've had my head cut open before," Shaver said. "You just want to get back into the game as soon as possible. (The cut) motivated me to get back in and go to work."</p>
<p>Shaver, who scored a combined 13 points in Ontario's two round-robin wins, played more than 25 minutes, counted 24 points, grabbed five rebounds, and added three assists and two blocked shots.</p>
<p>In its final girls' basketball round-robin game, Ontario lost for the first time, dropping a 69-62 decision to Quebec. Kellie Ring of Gloucester had six points while Micaella Riche of Ottawa scored four points.</p>

<p>Re: Vaccine for every Canadian, officials pledge, Aug. 7.</p>
<p>Those who do not remember history are doomed to repeat it. I have a scar on my arm to remind me of the the 1976 swine flu outbreak, also known as the swine flu fiasco, or the swine flu debacle.</p>
<p>It was a strain of H1N1 influenza virus that appeared in 1976. Infections were only detected from Jan. 19 to Feb. 9, 1976, and were not found outside Fort Dix in the U.S. The outbreak is most remembered for the mass immunization that it prompted in the United States and in the Canadian Army. The strain itself killed one person and hospitalized 13. However, side-effects from the vaccine caused 25 deaths and many hospitalizations in the U.S. and Canada, including some of my friends.</p>
<p>Canada never instituted mass immunizations like the U.S. did, but the Canadian Forces thought it was a good idea to try it out on its troops. My arm swelled up as if there was a boil. My friends were not so lucky, and some were hospitalized. These were young, healthy soldiers.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the old and very young were the most vulnerable. There were reports of Guillain-Barré syndrome, a paralysing neuromuscular disorder, affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations. This syndrome is a rare side-effect of modern influenza vaccines, with an incidence of about one case per million vaccinations. As a result, the public refused to trust a government-operated health program that killed old people and crippled young people. In total, less than 33 per cent of the population had been immunized by the end of 1976. The National Influenza Immunization Program was effectively halted on Dec. 16, 1976.</p>
<p>Overall, about 500 cases of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), resulting in death from severe pulmonary complications for 25 people, were probably caused by an immunopathological reaction to the 1976 vaccine.</p>
<p>If we learned anything from the 1976 swine flu fiasco, it should be that mass immunizations can kill or hurt more people than the actual disease, unless it is a killer like the Spanish Flu. But Health Canada knows this. Why would they buy 50 million doses of an untested vaccine when Canada only has a population of 36 million and only the old, young and immune-challenged really need it? I wonder what the health system could have done with the $400 million spent on the vaccine?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Schools would stay open in H1N1 outbreak; Ottawa public board plan in line with federal guidelines</b>
</div><div>Joanne Laucius   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board does not anticipate closing schools in the event of an H1N1 outbreak this fall, says the board's director of education.</p>
<p>Lyall Thomson said Wednesday he sees no reason to close schools.</p>
<p>Schools aren't the only places where young people gather in large numbers, he said. "If kids aren't at school, they're out congregating at the mall or the pool."</p>
<p>The board's full plan is to be released on its website on Friday. Thomson's remarks came only hours before the Public Health Agency of Canada released its H1N1 guidelines for schools, day cares and post-secondary institutions -- including a recommendation not to close schools.</p>
<p>The federal agency suggests there are more benefits than risks to keeping schools open.</p>
<p>"Schools, day cares and post-secondary institutions can play a crucial role in our pandemic response," Dr. David Butler Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Keeping schools open is an excellent way to educate and inform students and their families, minimize the impact of the virus on society and the economy, and it offers a good environment to offer the pandemic vaccine."</p>
<p>Health authorities have warned of the possibility of a resurgence of H1N1 this fall as students return to school. Early in June, as many as 29 schools in Ottawa reported having at least one suspected case of H1N1 and some schools in the U.S. closed after dozens of students fell ill.</p>
<p>The Ottawa-Carleton District School Board is the city's largest school board with 147 schools, almost 73,000 students and 4,500 teachers.</p>
<p>Thomson said the board was working to ensure that other strategies and procedures were in place in case of an outbreak:</p>
<p>- If more than 10 per cent of students are absent, principals are to notify school board administrators by 10 a.m.</p>
<p>Four staff members have been designated as the "response team" to analyse information about absences as it comes in, including the number of absent staff members. Decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, Thomson said.</p>
<p>"Not all of our schools will be impacted in the same way at the same time," Thomson said. "The key is that the staff knows what to do."</p>
<p>- There are currently about 700 occasional teachers on the school boards' supply list. Administrators are also discussing building a list of retired teachers who are available to work. The budget contains contingency funding for these kinds of emergencies, he said.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to keep certified teachers in front of students."</p>
<p>- Principals will stay in contact with parents through letters and messages on school and board websites, as well as though an automated phone system that continually phones students' homes until the message has been delivered.</p>
<p>Public Health Agency of Canada recommendations advise identifying students, staff and children with influenza-like illness as early as possible, encouraging hand washing and promoting good coughing and sneezing etiquette and promptly isolating students with an influenza-like illness in a separate room or area.</p>
<p>Among its other recommendations:</p>
<p>- Students who are ill should should be sent home with a parent and not travel on a bus, and they should remain at home until they are symptom-free.</p>
<p>- In settings where a large proportion of children have underlying illnesses that place them at risk, administrators should consider asking that children who are ill remain in isolation for seven days after the onset of symptoms or until all symptoms are over, whichever is longer.</p>
<p>Thomson said school board administrators would be meeting with principals next Thursday to outline the board's plan. There is also a more extensive pandemic plan in the works to cover outbreaks of other infectious diseases, such as the Norwalk virus.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has also recently advised that schools not close unless large numbers of students and teachers are ill. This spring in the U.S., closing schools caused a ripple effect, forcing thousands of working parents to remain at home.</p>
<p>At the same time, parents in the U.S. were advised to keep children at home for a week after the fever broke. That advisory has since been downgraded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 24 hours after the fever has broken.</p>
<p>Thomson said he will depend on advice from Ottawa Public Health on this and other matters around H1N1.</p>
<p>The city has a pandemic plan, but groups and agencies had been asked to draw up their own individual plans.</p>
<p>By late July, though, only the Catholic board had a comprehensive pandemic plan, which sets out in detail the steps to be taken if a school is closed.</p>
<p>For example, each Catholic board principal must list the two closest schools that can be used as alternative locations during the partial or complete closure of a school. The Catholic board plan also includes contingencies for governing the board if senior administrators become ill.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>It's been four decades since Gord Sloan lived on the family farm, but his agricultural roots have him more interested than most city dwellers in the state of the nation's food producers.</p>
<p>"I guess I'll always have some interest in what's going on with agriculture," he said Wednesday on his downtown balcony overlooking the Speed River.</p>
<p>Lately, Sloan has been engaged in a battle with the CBC, trying to convince the national broadcaster to drop its use of the term "swine flu" to describe what the World Health Organization calls the H1N1 influenza virus. Sloan said when the virus was identified months ago and quickly dubbed swine flu "I knew it was going to be problematic as time went on."</p>
<p>In April, the World Health Organization announced it would use H1N1 to describe the disease; a move since followed by the federal government, which has placed full-page newspaper ads teaching people how to protect themselves from the disease without once using the word swine.</p>
<p>But the media has been largely slow to follow suit.</p>
<p>On May 1, CBC executive editor Esther Enkin posted an article on the corporation's website in which she wrote it would be "very confusing" to change how the CBC referred to the illness given the use of swine flu until that time.</p>
<p>Sloan's attempts to contact Enkin about that article resulted in an email exchange with CBC ombud Vince Carlin, who undertook a review of the issue after receiving more than 60 complaints about the CBC's continued use of swine flu.</p>
<p>In a report sent to Sloan, Carlin wrote swine flu is "an accurate descriptor and is scientifically more precise" than H1N1.</p>
<p>Carlin, who could not be reached for comment Wednesday, wrote the particular strain of flu in the news has characteristics which distinguish it from other types of H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>But Sloan suggests this is splitting hairs, and is concerned if the same illness is referred to in various ways "it dilutes the message."</p>
<p>He understands in the first few months of the illness it was popularly known as swine flu. "But why was it known as that? People get that from the media or wherever they get their information from."</p>
<p>Keith Robbins, a spokesperson for the Guelph-based Ontario Pork Producers, said his group commissioned a study which indicated Ontario producers lost $9 million in the first four weeks after the coining of the term swine flu because of depressed commodities prices.</p>
<p>"It's hard to know what we might have lost in terms of trade . . . because as soon as something like this comes up a lot of countries almost automatically enact embargoes," Robbins said.</p>
<p>"It's frustrating," he added. "The World Health Organization is recognized on the world stage and they have asked people to stop using that (swine flu) term."</p>
<p>This week, delegates at the Tri-National Agricultural Accord unanimously endorsed a statement asking media to stop identifying new or existing diseases with "technically incorrect" names.</p>
<p>"The most recent example of this is the H1N1 Influenza Pandemic in humans that has been incorrectly labelled as ‘swine flu,' " the statement reads. "This has contributed to the collapse of the pork industry."</p>
<p>The tri-national accord, which has delegates from Canada, the U.S. and Mexico, noted while pork is safe to eat and there is no risk to consumers of cooked pork, "the continued use of the incorrect term for the H1N1 virus by many academics, public health websites and the media . . . contributes to a distorted perception of pork as a source of the disease and perpetuates an unwarranted and avoidable economic calamity for many pork producers."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>School closures not recommended to stall flu season: health officer</b>
</div><div>The Canadian Press   </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>The federal government is not recommending school closures to forestall what it expects will be a resurgent flu season for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>In fact, Canada's chief public health officer says closing schools could actually make matters worse by dispersing kids from a controlled school environment into the streets and malls where they might infect the elderly.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq released federal guidelines Wednesday for Canada's public schools, daycare centres, post-secondary institutions and boarding schools just a couple of weeks before classes resume.</p>
<p>The guidelines preach common-sense prevention techniques - such as hand-washing, coughing into sleeves and more frequent cleaning of washrooms and high-traffic areas - along with increased monitoring for the incidence of flu cases among students.</p>
<p>As Butler-Jones put it: "Simple guidelines can go a long way here."</p>
<p>Closing schools is highly disruptive to people's lives and of limited benefit in arresting the spread of the flu virus, he said.</p>
<p>"If you close the school based on a few cases, essentially what you're doing is taking a controlled situation . . . and creating an uncontrolled situation."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq reported that 67 Canadians have now died as a result of the H1N1 virus. But the vast majority of cases continue to be mild.</p>
<p>Reports out of the Southern Hemisphere - where the winter flu season is just ending - suggest the disease is levelling off.</p>
<p>Canada won't start vaccinating for the H1N1 virus until mid-November in anticipation of the peak flu season that occurs in January and February.</p>

<p>Canadians not educated enough</p>
<p>about flu, new top MD says, Aug. 16</p>
<p>In light of the fall H1N1 season, we should be concerned about a recent Canadian Medical Association poll illustrating that the health of lower-income Canadians is disproportionately impacted by the faltering economy. Moreover, the CMA suggests Canadians also don't know enough about the flu.</p>
<p>However, what about the world's truly poor? In the current economic situation, with H1N1 present, disadvantaged populations around the world are also at increased health risk. Look at Mexico in the 1990s, at a time of similar economic difficulty, when the national under-five mortality rates rose 7 per cent.</p>
<p>In our bid to stave off recession here, we should not fail to look to our government to provide concomitant support to the poor.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Development Agency announced earlier this year that a new focus for Canadian funds will be the health of children. Excellent decision. But now to make our aid really effective, we should ask the government to support proven solutions to pervasive health problems.</p>
<p>First, by renewing funding for the Canadian International Immunization Initiative.</p>
<p>Secondly, by committing funds to the Global Sanitation Fund, targeting simple hand washing.</p>
<p>If we can be educated, why can't we offer the same to the poor.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government likely won't help fund flu kits for Manitoba First Nations, with the country's top doctor saying some of the items in the kits may actually make the spread of H1N1 influenza worse.</p>
<p>The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs is soliciting donations for the kits it intends to provide to all 15,000 households on Manitoba reserves at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. The provincial government has said it would help pick up the tab, but the federal government is also being asked to chip in.</p>
<p>The kits will contain 20 face masks, latex gloves, a thermometer, enough Tylenol to treat patients with a fever for up to three days, hand-sanitizing wipes, information on symptoms of H1N1 and advice on what to do.</p>
<p>But Dr. David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer at the Public Health Agency of Canada, said items like gloves can give people a false sense of protection and are unwarranted.</p>
<p>"The wearing of gloves will not help," said Butler-Jones. "(H1N1 is) not spread through the skin. Often people who wear gloves don't wash their hands as often because they think they are protected."</p>
<p>Also, just because you are wearing a mask doesn't mean you won't rub your eyes or touch your face, he said.</p>
<p>In fact, if you are in a home with someone with the H1N1 flu, you've already been exposed to the virus even before you don a mask, he said.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones did advise all Canadians to equip their homes with soap, possibly hand sanitizer, thermometers, Tylenol and information on how to reduce the risk of spreading the flu.</p>
<p>But Ottawa seems unprepared to help fund the shipments of such items to First Nations, where they can be difficult to come by and sometimes are cost-prohibitive to residents.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said the federal government's funding is intended to help develop and implement pandemic plans on reserves.</p>
<p>She said nursing stations have been issued the equipment and supplies they need.</p>
<p>"All remote and isolated First Nations communities have adequate supply or access to pain-relief medication through their nursing station," Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>Neither she nor Butler-Jones said they will not fund the kits, but neither indicated any eagerness to participate.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure exactly what they are proposing to have in the kits," he said. "It's important we keep going back to the basics in terms of what makes sense for public health."</p>
<p>Glen Sanderson, of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, said it's all well and good to tell people to stock their homes with thermometers and Tylenol, but he said poverty and distance make that hard for First Nations.</p>
<p>"Our homes are our first line of defence," he said. "These medical kits will enable us to make them be that."</p>
<p>He said stores on reserves will sometimes carry thermometers and usually have Tylenol, but the price is three to four times what it is in Winnipeg. "We were hoping the federal government would come forward without being asked," Sanderson said.</p>
<p>But he said he's not surprised by the reaction because so far, nobody from Ottawa has acknowledged that First Nations are more vulnerable to H1N1 than other Canadians.</p>
<p>Residents in St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill were the worst affected in Manitoba so far, with hundreds of patients sick and dozens flown to Winnipeg by medevac for treatment.</p>
<p>There are nearly 7,000 reported cases of H1N1 in Canada so far, and 1,366 have been hospitalized with it. Some 67 have died. Aboriginals make up less than four per cent of Canada's population but accounted for 11.1 per cent of the total number of reported cases, 15.6 per cent of the hospitalized cases, 15 per cent of the patients admitted to intensive care with it, and 12.3 per cent of the deaths.</p>
<p>In Manitoba more than one in four of the 886 individuals diagnosed with H1N1 are First Nations.</p>

</p>
<p>THREE hundred children in God's River have no school to attend next month unless Ottawa comes through immediately with $75,000 for electrical repairs, Manto Sipi Cree Nation Chief Oliver Okemow said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It was brought to their attention in May. They've had all summer to rectify it," Okemow said. "It would only take a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>"They keep saying it's in the works," the chief said.</p>
<p>Okemow said the fire commissioner will not allow the kindergarten to Grade 11 Amos Okemow Memorial School to reopen until repairs are made.</p>
<p>"We have to look at the electrical, and at the sprinkler system -- there's one there, but it's not working," said Okemow, who said the school also needs a new fire alarm system.</p>
<p>"The buildings (in the community) we identified have no running water. With H1N1 coming, that's not advisable," he said.</p>
<p>Thompson is about 125 kilometres to the southwest, but there's no road, he said.</p>

<p>MC Hammer</p>
<p>Friday, Blush Ultraclub. This could either be a night of silly nostalgia or a train wreck. MC Hammer (Stanley Burrell) is best known for his 1990 hit U Can't Touch This and his 1996 bankruptcy. In the years since, he continued making records, became a preacher and starred in his own reality show, Hammertime. Maybe some of the $30 ticket price will be used to pay the IRS, which recently filed three more liens against him for $670,000.</p>
<p>Rock the Bells</p>
<p>Friday, Pyramid Cabaret. If relevant hip-hop is your thing, then Rock the Bells will have more to offer than MC Hammer. The touring show features supergroup Slaughterhouse -- Joe Budden, Royce Da 5'9'', Joell Ortiz and Crooked I -- Slum Village and Pete Rock, who is serving as the host. Tickets are $32.50 at <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span>.</p>
<p>H1N1 Fundraiser</p>
<p>Friday, West End Cultural Centre. With the H1N1 pandemic hitting First Nations communities hardest, Juno-winning roots-pop group Nathan, singer-songwriters Don Amero and Darren Lavallee and the Norman Chief Memorial Dancers are donating their time to help raise money for medical kits to be sent to communities throughout the province. Admission is $20.</p>
<p>Twilight Hotel</p>
<p>Friday, Times Change(d). Local roots duo Twilight Hotel -- Brandy Zdan and Dave Quanbury -- are packing up and moving to Austin, Texas, but before they go they are playing one last Winnipeg show with numerous guests, including Joanna Miller, Sky Onosson, Scott Nolan and Patrick Keenan. Admission is $10.</p>

</p>
<p>IQALUIT -- bcurry@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>The boy in the picture finally came home.</p>
<p>The small capital of Iqaluit was buzzing over a picture of him asleep outside the NorthMart store around 6 a.m. near one of his friends, who was also sleeping. The disturbing photo, snapped by a passerby, was on the local television newscast and on the front page of the Nunatsiaq News.</p>
<p>Social services acted quickly. They removed the 10-year-old and his four younger siblings from their home and placed them in foster care.</p>
<p>But within a few days, he was running again. In the middle of the night, he showed up on his mother's doorstep. She told him she would have to call social services to pick him up.</p>
<p>“I felt terrible telling my son that,” she says.</p>
<p>Co-operating, she says, is the only way she will get her children back.</p>
<p>Reaction to the photo has gone national. Prime Minister Stephen Harper called it a “terrible, tragic story” yesterday in Iqaluit.</p>
<p>The boy's mother wants people to know how it came to this. She says she doesn't do drugs, rarely has a drink and did all she could to find her boy that night. She says she is simply an overwhelmed single mother of five young children – including a 10-month-old baby – who was badly run down by seven weeks with the flu.</p>
<p>To protect her children, she requested anonymity. Below is an edited transcript of an interview she gave to The Globe and Mail from her home in Iqaluit.</p>
<p>It is a large five-bedroom home in a newer part of town. Skin from a seal she carved herself dries on the front porch. Children's toys are scattered in the front yard. Snow suits hang in the front closet near mitts and a couple of fishing rods.</p>
<p>There is a mattress on the floor of the living room, where she sleeps next to a lamp with no shade. Sheets cover the windows.</p>
<p>There is not much to her. She says she lost 25 pounds while battling the flu and is barely 100 pounds. On this day, she is wearing her son's soccer jersey, which she says comforts her.</p>
<p>The 31-year-old is soft-spoken, friendly and smiles a lot. She also wells up at times, pausing before going on with her story. The past few weeks have left her deeply upset and embarrassed.</p>
<p>What was happening at home that led to your son being out at night?</p>
<p>I was alone with five children, also ill with the flu. I'm not really sure if it was the swine flu. I was ill for, like, seven weeks … It was summer. My son loves to play outdoors. I was in a very stressful situation. I was struggling with the flu. I was struggling with a relationship breakup, hardly any support, rarely rested.</p>
<p>Would that be common that your son would be out late at night?</p>
<p>Around late spring, during the summer, yes, it's very common. There are times that he just takes off on me. It's hard to describe. The way I discipline is that I ground him. I'm not that harsh toward any of my children and probably he thinks he'll get away with it no problem.</p>
<p>Was that the first time he stayed out all night?</p>
<p>No. Before that I used to call the RCMP three times a week, all through the spring and the summer, there were times that I called the RCMP saying, “I'm missing my son.”</p>
<p>You say your oldest boy, the one in the photo, lived in an abusive environment when he was younger. For how long?</p>
<p>Six years he lived in that environment, from 1999 to 2005. [His father] was screaming, abusing me, letting the children watch. I thought I was doing them good by staying with their father. I finally realized that I was abusing them too by letting them watch their father verbally, physically, mentally abuse me … When that started happening, my son, who was four or five years old, would walk out the door and not come home for a while because it's not safe.</p>
<p>So it's a pattern that started then?</p>
<p>Yes. And it's a pattern I want to break.</p>
<p>You don't think he has any reason to get stressed out and leave now, in this house?</p>
<p>I think it's very stressful because I look to him most times to help me with the parenting, at least some help from him, but not too much, just a little.</p>
<p>You can't go look for him when he runs away because you're alone with four young children?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Had you called the RCMP that night [of the photo]?</p>
<p>During the afternoon, I called and called. They hadn't spotted him. I know I was annoying them, but I was so worried. I called my friends, family, relatives. All the phone numbers. “If you spot him, please tell him to come home.”</p>
<p>But you couldn't get anybody to go out looking for him?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>You said you've heard people talking about the parents when the picture came out. Is there anything you'd like to say to those people?</p>
<p>I try my best to be a loving parent, for my children to be healthy mentally, physically and emotionally. Most parents lack support. Raising five children is a struggle, not impossible, but it's a struggle with no vehicle, taxi money all the time, it's very hard. It's challenging. I'm unable to do outdoor activities with him as much as he needs and that could be very stressful for him and for me.</p>
<p>Tell me about the day the picture appeared.</p>
<p>I felt awful. I'm so embarrassed. I'm a parent for one of the children, who is responsible for him sleeping out there. It's sad. Heartbreaking. It makes me scared of people [in town]. If they know who I was, maybe they would come up to me and say, “You're a bad parent, you're a very, very bad parent.” One look at that picture, you could say: “They're so pitiful. Their parents are so irresponsible. Drunks. Drug addicts.” Then they would start hating me without getting the whole story, what's really behind it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'I felt like I was getting stabbed'; $2.8-million business, 16 years of work gone for Derwent couple</b>
</div><div>Brent Wittmeier </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>785 words</div><div>19 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal </div>
</p>
<p>It was just before midnight Monday when Don Gulayec woke to a cellphone ring and realized his power was out.</p>
<p>It took a few minutes to realize why. Gulayec's eastern Alberta pig breeding facility, with 900 sows and 1,500 piglets inside, was on fire, knocking out a transformer in a blaze which would destroy his livelihood.</p>
<p>During the next five hours, 50 firefighters from four local fire departments battled the flames, but could not save Deeze Farms Ltd., about 200 kilometres east of Edmonton.</p>
<p>Gulayec and his wife Debbie built the $2.8-million business over 16 years of hard work.</p>
<p>"It's overwhelming," said Gulayec, 52. "The only way to know the feeling is to see what you planned as your future go up in smoke and there's nothing you can do." The Gulayecs were asleep when they received a choppy cellphone call from a neighbour asking if they were at home.</p>
<p>After the call disconnected due to bad reception, Gulayec went into his kitchen to get a better signal.</p>
<p>That's when he got to the windows and saw the flames billowing from his two-storey barn.</p>
<p>"It felt like I was getting stabbed. I thought about the animals, you know, 'what can we do?' "</p>
<p>"Then I started thinking, 'Wow, the work that went in here and look how it's going.' There's a multitude of things that went through my head and none of them were good."</p>
<p>There was little the Gulayecs could do about their animals. Not only are pigs instinctively unlikely to leave a burning barn when frightened, but the floors of much of the facility were plastic, creating dangerous fumes.</p>
<p>Gulayec was left sitting helplessly in a chair while firefighters battled the blaze.</p>
<p>The combination of smoke, burning plastic, and the charred carcasses were so severe Gulayec could no longer smell anything.</p>
<p>After the fire, Gulayec found the ear tags and remembered individual animals he had owned for up to three years.</p>
<p>Early Tuesday afternoon, Derwent firefighters were still putting out smouldering debris and small flames, extinguishing the blaze at 3 p. m. The massive barn had been reduced to a heap, the tin roof swaying and crackling in the wind. Charred concrete walls and a warped feed bin testified to the heat of the blaze.</p>
<p>Brad Straty, Two Hills County fire chief, said the cause of the fire was awaiting further investigation, but an initial examination showed an electrical fault may be to blame.</p>
<p>"It may have been an electrical fan that pulls the fumes from out of the building," Straty said.</p>
<p>Born and raised in the area, the Gulayecs returned in 1993 with three teenage daughters after spending nearly two decades in other parts of the province. The couple renovated the hog farm three times, bumping its capacity from 130 to 900 sows to keep the operation profitable.</p>
<p>All three daughters married and began raising families nearby. The Gulayecs now have four grandchildren.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of memories," said their daughter Deirdre Myshaniuk, 30.</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, Myshaniuk's two sons picked raspberries with other family members, while neighbours and friends dropped by the farm to comfort the Gulayecs and provide them with meals.</p>
<p>Before the blaze, Deeze Farms produced 300 pigs per week and an estimated 16,000 pigs per year. The company specialized in a unique fast-growing European breed of pigs, which to the best of Gulayec's knowledge, is the last of their stock in North America.</p>
<p>It had already been a difficult year before the blaze. H1N1, initially labelled swine flu, sent pork prices tumbling.</p>
<p>While not as hard hit as farmers producing pork for consumption, the Gulayecs were only breaking even. The fire came just days after the federal government announced a $92-million relief program to help the ailing pork industry.</p>
<p>Gulayec is unsure he'll be eligible for any of the aid. While insurance will cover a portion of the losses, he isn't certain what the final damage tally will be. Gulayec said it's too early to know what they'll do next.</p>

</div><div>Jamie Komarnicki, With Files From Michelle Lang And Jason
Van Rassel   </div>
<div>For the Calgary Herald</div>
<div>1648 words</div><div>19 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Reserves, day cares and group homes across Calgary and southern Alberta are escalating their pandemic planning this fall as those most vulnerable to H1N1 say they're concerned about the impacts they could face at the peak of flu season.</p>
<p>Several groups of people--including aboriginals, pregnant women, seniors and those with underlying health conditions--are believed to be particularly susceptible to H1N1 for various reasons.</p>
<p>Alberta health officials, who are warning the public to prepare for a possible second wave of the virus this fall, say they are developing a communications strategy for high-risk patients.</p>
<p>The strategy will, for example, tell pregnant women it's important to get vaccinated against H1N1 because they are at a greater risk of developing severe disease from the virus. High-risk groups will also be encouraged to seek early treatment from the medical system, under the strategy.</p>
<p>Some of those most at risk are troubled.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of concern, but in the process of concern we're doing the utmost to be prepared," said Patricia YellowHorn-Melton, community health co-ordinator for the Piikani reserve, about 200 kilometres south of Calgary.</p>
<p>The tribe's six-person health team is tacking up posters, handing out pamphlets and planning its annual seasonal flu immunization as a trial run for an upcoming H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>They're also fending off fears over how H1N1 could hit the reserve. Only two cases have been confirmed among southern Alberta's Treaty 7 nations, but leaders have sounded the alarm over cramped housing and unique health concerns that could put their band members at risk for exposure.</p>
<p>"Community members, I think a lot of them are starting to become aware of what's going on. They have questions, they call and ask," said YellowHorn-Melton, the nurse in charge of the small native reserve.</p>
<p>"I told the staff we need to start preparing for a pandemic because it's something that's going to occur sooner or later."</p>
<p>Natives aren't the only people taking special measures heading into flu season.</p>
<p>Medical experts are still learning more about the disease. But, for varying reasons, several population groups appear to be particularly at risk for the new strain of the flu.</p>
<p>Infants, women in mid-to-late pregnancy and people with underlying health conditions including asthma, heart disease and severe diabetes, seem to be hit with especially severe attacks once infected, said a University of Calgary flu expert.</p>
<p>While some seniors appear to be protected, possibly immune due to previous exposure to another type of the flu in the past, once they're infected, it's usually a serious case, said Dr. Jim Dickenson.</p>
<p>"Those people, if they get it, they may get it quite badly," said Dickenson.</p>
<p>The numbers are just a sliver of the total population, he added.</p>
<p>But after a slight lull during the summer months, the overall number of H1N1 cases is expected to pick up during the regular flu season. Further, experts are warning the virus could develop into a more severe strain.</p>
<p>Tanya Szarko said she feels an extra sense of responsibility for the 115 children and staff at her downtown day care, Bow Valley Child Care.</p>
<p>When the disease first hit this spring, workers put up hand sanitizer dispensers at the day care entrance and continued to regularly remind parents and kids to stay home if they were feeling ill, she said. So far, they haven't experienced any H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>But, with children considered super-spreaders of flu, Szarko says the day care will be heightening its efforts to fight off H1N1 come fall.</p>
<p>"More bleaching toys and tables and chairs and bleaching after the (children) leave the certain play areas . . . Do we have enough staff so we can allow our staff to go home if they have minor symptoms and how much is that going to cost us," said Szarko, who also represents the Daycare Society of Alberta.</p>
<p>"Those are critical things."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada, the lead body on Canadian pandemic planning, recommends that schools and day cares stay open even if there is a confirmed H1N1 patient since the current cases are causing generally mild illness with symptoms similar to seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Closing the facilities would provide more of a disruption than the potential benefits, although the recommendations could change as the disease progresses.</p>
<p>The plan also recommends that ill students and staff stay at home.</p>
<p>Indeed, an outbreak would inevitably lead to higher absentee rates--a growing concern among the care providers who'd like to be first in line for a vaccine.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said she expects the H1N1 vaccine will be ready by November, but not all doses will be available at once. Federal health officials are creating a list of priority patients who should receive the shots first, which is expected to be complete by the fall.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services has said it will base its vaccinations on the federal program. Determining who gets the initial doses is extremely complicated, said Dickinson.</p>
<p>"If we define it too widely, then we can't really provide the service. If we define it too narrowly, then we could miss people who need to be helped," he said. "We've got to use every bit of information we can find to make the right decisions."</p>
<p>Most agencies are focusing on simple health practices, such as meticulous hand washing, as the best way to stave off the spread.</p>
<p>" Our population is vulnerable and our job is to decrease their risk," said Jennifer McCue, vice-president and chief operating officer of Bethany Care Society, which provides long-term care to about 900 seniors and adults with disabilities.</p>
<p>"We do that by educating, informing and protecting them from the risk," McCue said.</p>
<p>Many of the groups seemingly prone to H1N1 are also susceptible to seasonal flu strains and already have practices in place to deal with issues such as educating patients and setting up annual immunization clinics.</p>
<p>"A lot of what we're doing is very similar to what we're doing every year for seasonal flu," said McCue.</p>
<p>At her downtown day care, Szarko says she plans to meet with staff next week to come up with an enhanced H1N1 plan.</p>
<p>She doesn't want to overreact. But with the potential severity of the disease -- and children's role in spreading the virus--every case of the sniffles will warrant a closer look, she said.</p>
<p>The day care society is also developing a plan to network with other care centres across the city to support each other during a crisis.</p>
<p>"I don't think we can overreact and panic," said Szarko. "But the most important thing is the health and safety of children in our facility."</p>
<p>Other facilities simply don't have the option of shutting down during a pandemic.</p>
<p>There are currently no H1N1 cases in the federal prison system, but the Correctional Service of Canada said it is planning a voluntary immunization program this fall for the estimated 14,000 inmates in custody.</p>
<p>Preparations taking place in the six men's and one women's institutions in Alberta are similar to those taking place across the country, corrections spokesman Jeff Campbell said.</p>
<p>"We've been in consultation with the appropriate public health authorities for the past few months," he said.</p>
<p>Plans for dealing with H1N1 cases inside the prisons range from placing individual patients in medical isolation beds already in use for other contagious conditions, to quarantining entire institutions if necessary. In between, there are several other measures officials can take, such as restricting inmates' movements.</p>
<p>The correctional service has also distributed a list of frequently asked questions and answers to inmates, and institutions have several signs reminding people to wash their hands, Campbell said.</p>
<p>Similarly, the service has circulated information to staff and stockpiled protective equipment and garb for employees, he added.</p>
<p>Unlike other facilities, prisons can't shut down, so the correctional service has had to devise a contingency plan to ensure they're staffed even if large numbers of employees become ill.</p>
<p>"It's to ensure the business of the institutions can continue," Campbell said.</p>
<p>As a national organization, the correctional service can draw staff from other regions and many administrative staff also have prior experience working in institutions and would be able to fill in, added Campbell.</p>
<p>In Alberta, the solicitor general's department has had to make similar arrangements for provincial jails, which house inmates serving sentences of less than two years.</p>
<p>"It's not an option in corrections, to have people not coming into work," spokeswoman Michelle Davio said.</p>
<p>Like the federal prison system, provincial jails have stocked up on protective equipment and the solicitor general has made provisions for temporarily hiring retirees and giving casual staff additional hours if a high rate of correctional workers gets sick.</p>
<p>Officials in Alberta have tailored their response for three scenarios: mild, moderate and severe, the latter based on an infection rate of 35 per cent or higher, said Davio.</p>
<p>"We're prepared for the worst, hoping for the best," Davio said.</p>

<p>The latest numbers from the International Air Transport Association suggest the steep decline in premium class and economy air travel might be moderating. The June statistics derived from member airlines say economy passengers fell on average by 5.5 per cent from a year earlier, a slower rate than the fall of 7.6 per cent in May. Premium cabin demand was down 21.3 per cent in June, year-to-year, compared with 23.6 per cent in May. Economy passenger traffic has shown signs of reaching a floor since March, IATA said, but up to June, this seemed largely due to business travellers switching into economy, rather than indicating any underlying stabilization in demand. Not all markets felt a stabilizing trend in June, IATA added, Some Asian markets showed more deterioration, not only due to the recession but also the H1N1 scare.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pork farmers await details on aid</b>

</p>
<p>Alberta's struggling pork producers are facing a tough decision this fall: stick it out or get out of the industry altogether.</p>
<p>Industry officials are waiting for details of Ottawa's recently announced plans to help pork farmers, which include $75 million in both loans to help farms restructure or transition out of the business.</p>
<p>Producers won't know for several weeks who can qualify and for how much, said Jodi Bakke, director of policy and communications for Alberta Pork.</p>
<p>"It's still leaves them pretty much hanging," she said.</p>
<p>Canada's pork industry had called for an immediate injection of $800 million in government aid to solve the liquidity crisis that's pushed the sector to the brink.</p>
<p>It estimated the industry is losing around $3.4 million a day, as the financial toll from years of high feed costs, trade issues and a robust loonie, followed by the fallout from H1N1 influenza, leave producers struggling.</p>
<p>The number of Alberta pork farmers has dwindled to about 400 from about 1,500 five years ago. Producers, expecting to lose between $45 and $55 per hog, have already begun to sell their herds, said bakke.</p>
<p>"It was too late for them. There is definitely going to be a reduction in the herds in Alberta as well as in Canada, we just don't know at what extreme yet," she said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, federal agriculture minister Gerry Ritz pledged $92 million for Canada's ailing hog industry, money aimed at helping producers get out of the business and farms to restructure to become profitable again.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>City shelters could close doors if outbreak occurs</b>
</div><div>Colette Derworiz   </div>

</p>
<p>Calgary's shelters could close their doors -- or even lock sick people inside -- to prevent the spread of illness should an H1N1 outbreak hit the city's homeless population.</p>
<p>Officials with local shelters and service agencies have been meeting with Alberta Health Services to prepare a pandemic response plan, which should be ready later this month.</p>
<p>Although the efforts so far have focused on preventive measures, such as handwashing and vaccines, the plans will also prepare for the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>"It really is about the backup staff and closing the doors," said Carlene Donnelly, executive director of the Calgary Urban Project Society, a non-profit organization that has taken the lead on planning. "It really would come down to literally shutting doors.</p>
<p>"But really, at the end of the day, there is no way we could handle them all being transient when they are sick, so it could come down to not just closing the doors, but closing the doors and not letting them out."</p>
<p>The plans are part of a greater effort by Alberta Health Services to prepare for a potential flu outbreak this fall.</p>
<p>Tim Richter, president of the Calgary Homeless Foundation, said he's concerned the homeless population won't get the attention it requires in the pandemic plans.</p>
<p>"The homeless population needs a specific focus for a (few) reasons," he said. "First, they tend to have fairly compromised health. They are packed quite together quite tightly. Third, they don't necessarily have the means to or the ability to care for themselves.</p>
<p>"The hospitals say, 'If you are sick, stay home and drink lots of fluid and take two Advil,'" he said. "Well, how can a person who is homeless go home? If they go home, they are going to a shelter. And if they are going to a shelter, they are around other people, so we are concerned."</p>
<p>Richter said a typical cold or flu spreads through shelters "like wildfire," so it'll be really tough to prevent and contain.</p>
<p>"We have put this as an issue of concern that we are hoping Housing and Urban Affairs is paying attention to," he said.</p>
<p>Alberta Housing and Urban Affairs referred comment to the provincial health ministry.</p>
<p>John Tuckwell, spokesman for Alberta Health and Wellness, said homeless people could end up being part of the vulnerable group who would be first in line for vaccine and require specialized attention.</p>
<p>"It's not finalized," he said, noting they are working directly with Housing and Urban Affairs to connect with the specific shelters and agencies.</p>

<p>The federal government is expected to release new guidelines for schools this week on how they should respond to a severe swine flu pandemic in the fall, information that is anxiously being awaited by Canada's teachers.</p>
<p>Individual school boards have been fine-tuning their pandemic plans over the summer in preparation of a new school year and taking cues from their local public health authorities and provincial health ministries, but the federal guidelines will also be welcomed, said Mary-Lou Donnelly, president of the Canadian Teachers' Federation.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawans adore their cable TV</b>
</div><div>Ken Gray   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>911 words</div><div>19 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Last December, I asked Ottawans about the kind of city they wanted. I didn't expect much of a response, it being Christmas shopping and preparation season. Traditionally that's a slow period for letters.</p>
<p>But surprise, surprise. E-mails flooded in from good people who wanted more cycling paths and lanes, a pedestrian-oriented city, and better transit. They called for a vibrant downtown, more cafés and more movie theatres in the downtown core. Readers suggested self-sufficient suburbs, allowing fewer trucks on King Edward Avenue, increasing urban density, and creating more galleries and museums.</p>
<p>Now I have discovered it was all a lie.</p>
<p>That's not to say that the people who wrote in didn't want what they claimed. No, the vast mass of Ottawans didn't respond ... until now. You see the silent majority has spoken in the last couple of weeks. We now understand what Ottawans really want -- better cable TV.</p>
<p>How do I know this? I've been following the controversy concerning Rogers Cable threatening to pull WPBS Watertown from the local television dial on my blog, The Bulldog. Rogers planned to replace it with PBS Detroit, citing a better quality signal from Michigan rather than the one from nearby upper New York state.</p>
<p>The uproar from this issue was overwhelming. I had the second-highest total of hits ever in a day to that point on The Bulldog from the WPBS issue. And that was on the Bulldoggiest of dog days of summer. In September, it would have been the biggest readership day ever ... not even close.</p>
<p>One councillor said the WPBS issue was bringing 80 calls a day to his office. Swine flu about two a week. The cable debate even exceeded the phone calls the councillor received during the bus strike.</p>
<p>So now we know what Ottawans want. Better cable television. This is not good.</p>
<p>For television, even excellent television, is very isolating. WPBS rather fits the Ottawa mould. The nation's capital is wealthy and well-educated. So when we watch TV, it's not the A-Channel, local as it once was, but WPBS. We might not be able to complete a light-rail plan, or build a successful sewer, but when we drive home to our suburban dwellings, Ottawans can turn to NOVA on the tube and tsk-tsk about global warming and pollution. We are <span class="companylink">La-Z-Boy</span> liberals.</p>
<p>Watching television, from a community perspective, is not good. The antiques glued to Antiques Roadshow aren't exactly getting exercise, except to get up now and then for another glass of white wine or a small bag of low-cal, no-butter popcorn. The only real way you know a television viewer isn't dead is to turn off the TV to see if they squirm. When they don't move, put a mirror under their nose.</p>
<p>All this TV-watching explains a lot. A friend of mine illustrates this point. He finds Ottawa dull and, as time passes, despite my love for the city, I'm tempted to agree. He once downhill skied but can't now due to infirmities; same with tennis. He used to have season tickets for baseball and football but both have disappeared. He likes hockey and popular music, not classical or jazz, thus much of the festival season is lost on him. He's a theatre patron, even a significant donor, but the pickings on that score here are slim, particularly in summer. Movies and dining are passions, but you can do that here and most anywhere else.</p>
<p>He is wealthy, well-educated, a great believer in fun, and as engaging a conversationalist as you'll find. He is the kind of person this city needs but, were he not tied to the health system with a good set of doctors, this life-long resident of Ottawa would leave. It's just too dull for him.</p>
<p>For my friend and others like him, we need to unite behind the Lansdowne Live! project (flaws and all) to provide a bit of enjoyment. Meanwhile, our community leaders should put a viable baseball team in the $20-million stadium growing weeds and groundhogs on Coventry Road. This city needs people like my friend, and his tastes are not dissimilar from the mass of the public.</p>
<p>Maybe residents are transfixed to WPBS for a lack of entertainment alternatives. Or entertainment can't prosper here because people are watching television. Chicken and egg, egg and chicken. But what we do know is that, at last report, the Senators' season-ticket base (not high at the best of times) is down about a third. The Senators are superb theatre. Perhaps it's egg and chicken.</p>
<p>I'm easy to keep happy, but even I'm feeling a bit bored in Ottawa this mid-August. The town might be regaining its status as the city that fun forgot. If we are to attract good people to build this community, we need to get residents out of their rec rooms, provide some fun and get them to buy a few tickets. Man cannot live by plasma screen alone.</p>

</div><div>GLORIA GALLOWAY </div>
<div>STAFF AFP AP</div>
<div>756 words</div><div>19 August 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Canadians will wait for vaccinations against pandemic H1N1 influenza even as bulk vaccine shipments are exported to other countries because <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> can produce more vaccine at its Quebec plant than it can put into vials.</p>
<p>U.S. health officials recognized this week that a similar problem would slow the rollout of the vaccine to Americans and began hunting for factories that can get more of the liquid into vials quicker.</p>
<p>But, despite the limited capacity of its fill line in Ste-Foy, Que., the pharmaceutical company with the sole contract to produce pandemic flu vaccine for Canadians is not looking for help to package the drug for domestic distribution.</p>
<p>When asked repeatedly whether another Canadian pharmaceutical manufacturer would be approached to provide assistance, GSK would state only that it is living up to its agreement with Canada.</p>
<p>“GSK is meeting all of its contractual obligations to the Canadian government as it relates to H1N1 – and we are well on target to meet these commitments,” Marie-Christine Beauchemin, a spokeswoman for the drug maker, said in an e-mail when asked whether other companies would be asked to participate in the fill process.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said yesterday that it would take some time to get all Canadians vaccinated regardless of how quickly GSK was able to deliver the vaccine.</p>
<p>And an agency spokesman said that the drug company looked at the possibility of getting another manufacturer to help fill the vials, but it was decided that doing so could have an impact on the delivery of other essential vaccines.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50 million doses from GSK, a long-standing contract that requires delivery “as quickly as possible,” a company official said.</p>
<p>GSK has also allocated 20 per cent of the vaccine produced at its Canadian manufacturing site to developing countries. That includes a proposed donation of 50 million doses to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>But the company refuses to explain where the bulk shipments from the Ste-Foy plant will go.</p>
<p>“Announcements about vaccine supply for individual countries/organizations are under the discretion of the country/organization to make public. GSK will not disclose contractual information on behalf of these bodies,” a spokeswoman said this week in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Northern Hemisphere countries have so far ordered more than one billion doses from several drug companies, the World Health Organization said yesterday.</p>
<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has long predicted it would have 120 million doses on hand by Oct. 15, but now expects just 45 million by that date because of the packaging delays.</p>
<p>In Canada, the Ste-Foy facility will begin producing vaccine in November, or possibly late October, and it will be Christmas before every Canadian who wants a shot can get one.</p>
<p>It takes two weeks for the vaccine to be considered fully effective. And many people will require more than one shot. Which means it will be February or even March before the vaccine is protecting all of the Canadians who are inoculated. That is well after the traditional flu season begins in December.</p>
<p>Drug makers around the world have said the strain is producing about 30 per cent of the yield of the normal flu virus. Even if that is the case, GSK says it can make more than enough to meet the Canadian demand.</p>
<p>John Treanor, a vaccine expert at the University of Rochester in New York, said even November could be too late for the vaccinations to start.</p>
<p>“It depends on when the swine flu comes back – and that is extremely unpredictable,” Dr. Treanor said.</p>
<p>It could return with the regular flu season in December. Or it could reappear in September, he said.</p>
<p>“The experience in the U.S. last summer, or early spring, seemed to be that a lot of the flu activity at least started in schools and it went away when school was over. So, if you follow that logic, you might be concerned that the next wave of this would start up when kids go back to school very shortly,” Dr. Treanor said.</p>
<p>“And that makes the vaccine delay a little bit more important because it would mean, at least in the beginning, your first response to any upsurge in activity will not include the vaccine because it would not be available.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu supplies for First Nations - Province steps up to equip northern communities</b>
</div><div>By Matt Preprost    </div>

</p>
<p>The Doer government will help pick up the tab for thousands of flu kits that will help ailing aboriginal communities combat an expected resurgence of H1N1 this fall.</p>
<p>The province said Tuesday it will pay the remaining balance for 15,000 medical kits destined for First Nations communities to curb the spread of the virus and prevent families from getting sick.</p>
<p>The initiative is led by the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, which continues to seek corporate sponsorship to fund the kits.</p>
<p>"We are a supporter of this initiative," said Health Minister Theresa Oswald. "We will provide any outstanding funds so these kits can get to community households on time. We don't want funding to be a barrier."</p>
<p>The province has "stepped up" said AMC Grand Chief Ron Evans late Tuesday night.</p>
<p>"The province is doing what is necessary, putting people before politics," he said.</p>
<p>AMC has estimated the cost of the kits to reach $1.5 million -- or about $100 per kit. So far, the AMC has received over $15,000 of corporate support from the likes of CIBC and other pharmaceutical companies, Evans said.</p>
<p>Health Canada came under fire last month for delaying a shipment of hand sanitizers to remote northern First Nations because they contained alcohol. At the time, the AMC said some communities had to wait almost a month before they got the sanitizers they needed.</p>
<p>Evans said First Nations can't afford to wait for the federal government's help.</p>
<p>"I think what was happening was we were all waiting for the federal government to respond and help us prepare to help our communities but that hasn't transpired yet," he said.</p>
<p>Oswald called the province's ability to step in an "advantage of proximity."</p>
<p>"Certainly in Manitoba we have a distinct advantage of working alongside AMC all the time," she said.</p>
<p>The kits were built in consultation with the province and will be stocked with everything needed to prevent contracting the virus: masks, rubber gloves, tissue, hand sanitizers, Tylenol, thermometers and information on how to deal with symptoms.</p>
<p>Each reserve home will get a kit, Evans said.</p>
<p>"If someone has symptoms, they now know what to do and have some things to work with," Evans said. "Before, without the kit, they were sitting out in the open, without medication and information on how to treat themselves."</p>
<p>Added Oswald: "These are things most people would naturally find in their homes, or if they didn't, drive down to Shopper's to get. This will be like a medicine cabinet for them to have."</p>
<p>Communities will be prioritized, but Evans hopes the kits will be distributed in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>"What we're going to be doing is getting them in there as quickly as possible," said Evans, adding a plan to get them into the hands of his people has yet to be figured out. "Household members may pick them up or they may distribute them from home to home."</p>
<p>The province will assist with distribution through regional health authorities if AMC requests it, Oswald said.</p>
<p>Health experts predict H1N1 will make a resurgence this fall, pushing the H1N1 crisis to a global pandemic. With fall just around the corner, Evans isn't taking those predictions lightly.</p>
<p>"I'm very much worried," he said. "I don't take lightly what the health professionals have been predicting, that it will hit pretty hard."</p>
<p>Manitoba First Nations top the list in confirmed H1N1 flu cases among Canadian aboriginal people, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada. Manitoba has already sent beleaguered aboriginal communities over 2,600 respirator masks, 9,000 surgical masks, 45 treatment courses of Tamiflu, and 858 litres of hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>To date, there have been 884 reported laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 in Manitoba and seven deaths. Across Canada, more than 1,300 have been hospitalized and 66 people have died.</p>
<p>On Friday night, members of the local music community are rallying for First Nation communities affected by the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Juno-winning roots-pop group Nathan, singer-songwriters Don Amero and Darren Lavallee and the Norman Chief Memorial Dancers will perform at a fundraiser at the West End Cultural Centre.</p>
<p>Tickets are $20 at the Manitoba Chamber of Commerce, Prairie Architects, Manitoba Music, NCI FM, the Aboriginal Chamber of Commerce and the Folk Festival Music Store.</p>
<p>All money raised will be donated to the AMC and used for H1N1 medical kits.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1 vaccine safety, efficacy questioned, Aug. 7.</p>
<p>Applause to Arthur Schafer, the ethicist at the University of Manitoba, for the valid concerns he raised regarding the safety of the H1N1 vaccine. It can be successfully argued that in the past, vaccines have helped prevent the spread of smallpox and polio. But, some scientists are also arguing that inoculating millions of people with an H1N1 flu vaccine that isn't 100 per cent on target, can potentially put pressure on the virus to mutate into something more potent and infectious.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine will also contain adjuvants. Adjuvants are pharmacological agents that are added to a drug to increase or assist its effectiveness. Many adjuvants are oil- based and have been found to be toxic in lab rats causing them neurological problems, among others. Humans have also experienced health issues with vaccines.</p>
<p>In 1976, there was a swine flu outbreak that began at the Fort Dix army base in New Jersey. Fearing the worst, U.S. federal authorities began a mass vaccination program. A short time thereafter, reports started arriving of people who had been vaccinated coming down with Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing nerve disease.</p>
<p>Within two months of the mass vaccinations, 500 people were affected with the disease and more than 30 had died. Amid a rising uproar and increasing public reluctance to take the shot, federal officials quickly cancelled the vaccination program. The feared pandemic, thankfully, never materialized. Let us all hope that the decision to be inoculated or not with the H1N1 vaccine is left up to every individual and that those decisions are made by a well-informed public who have carefully weighed their options.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>CMA urges appointing health czar for pandemic</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick </div>

<p>The federal government should appoint a national "health czar" with legal authority to impose directives on the provinces during the swine flu pandemic, according to the Canadian Medical Association Journal.</p>
<p>In an editorial appearing Monday, the journal calls for a "visible, independent" person who would have several responsibilities, but most importantly, would have the power to enforce his or her recommendations.</p>
<p>With health care delivery being a closely guarded responsibility of the provinces and territories, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, is limited in what he can do and that makes for a flawed system, suggested Dr. Paul Hebert, editor-in-chief of the CMAJ, especially in a pandemic situation.</p>
<p>"In an emergency you need to say, 'I'm sorry, here are the rules.' That's not David Butler-Jones right now. I think he's doing a great job given the mandate that he currently has, but I think we need something different for this upcoming crisis," Hebert said in an interview.</p>
<p>Swine flu, known by its scientific name as the H1N1 virus, arrived in Canada in the spring and could turn into a more severe pandemic during the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Hebert said too much time could potentially be spent wrangling over how provinces want to do things differently.</p>
<p>"If there's any debate, it never stops. You can't do that in an emergency," he said.</p>
<p>When the Public Health Agency of Canada was created and Butler-Jones was appointed to head it in 2004, the Canadian Medical Association suggested the federal government enact legislation to give him clear legal powers in a time of crisis, but the recommendation wasn't followed.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said at the time that his role would be to act as a national "facilitator" and to bring together the country's experts for advice on how to respond to another SARS or other infectious disease outbreak.</p>
<p>But Hebert maintains that's not the efficient way to deal with an emergency.</p>
<p>"You need someone who has the authority to say, 'Listen, I'm sorry, I've considered all the advice, this is how we're doing it,'" said Hebert, a critical care doctor in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Convincing the provinces, however, to adopt a health czar model with authoritative power could prove to be a challenge.</p>
<p>Manitoba's health minister, Theresa Oswald, said her support for the idea would depend on what the czar's powers would be -- if the person was appointed to help the provinces communicate and facilitate faster responses to health emergencies, she would be open to it, but issuing nationwide directives and expecting them to apply equally in all provinces is another matter.</p>

<p>A Quebec mayor will avoid handshakes -- one of a politician's favourite tools -- to curb the spread of the H1N1 virus during municipal elections this fall.</p>
<p>Public health authorities are bracing for a more virulent outbreak of H1N1 later this year, and the mayor of the municipality of L'Ancienne-Lorette, just outside Quebec City, is taking the threat seriously and banning handshakes in his campaign.</p>
<p>"On the campaign trail, you meet tens of people every day. By avoiding to shake hands, we want to protect the health of our citizens," said Emile Loranger.</p>
<p>Municipal elections will be held in 1,100 cities and towns across Quebec on Nov. 1, at the onset of the flu season.</p>
<p>"We have to look beyond politics. It's not worth it to take risks when you know that kids are more vulnerable to the virus," Loranger said Monday.</p>
<p>L'Ancienne-Lorette is home to some 12,000 voters.</p>
<p>The mayor also noted his staff will avoid organizing public gatherings during the campaign.</p>
<p>Quebec public health authorities say it is premature to call for such drastic measures.</p>
<p>"We are closely monitoring the evolution of the virus and we think the best way to prevent infection is still to to have good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly," said spokeswoman Dominique Breton.</p>
<p>Health authorities also recommend covering up coughs and sneezes with an arm, avoiding physical contact with anyone who might be sick and staying home if showing signs of the flu.</p>
<p>Kumanan Wilson, Canada research chair in public health at the University of Ottawa, said people should not start to panic ahead of a second wave of swine flu.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 13, the H1N1 virus had been linked to 66 deaths in Canada.</p>

</p>
<p>The numbers have generally run against the Victoria Seals in their inaugural Golden Baseball League season, the home portion of which concludes this week at Royal Athletic Park.</p>
<p>Although not mathematically eliminated from the playoffs, the Seals would need an extraordinary chain of events to occur to make the post-season. By going 1-5 in the recent six-game set against the North</p>
<p>Division-leading Calgary Vipers, the Seals (11-20 in the second half and 28-44 overall) pretty much assured the need of a miracle to extend the season into September.</p>
<p>Yet there are several categories to which Victoria can point with a degree of pride as it heads into the final six home dates of the season, beginning tonight at 7 p.m. against the South Division second-place Orange County Flyers (15-11 in the second half).</p>
<p>The Seals lead the GBL with 81 home runs, Jamar Hill leads the league individually with 17 homers with Sergio Pedroza second at 15. Pitcher Isaac Hess leads the league with 90 strikeouts and is tied for the league lead with nine victories, and Victoria is second in GBL attendance with a 2,256 average per game.</p>
<p>Despite the leadership in notable categories, the long ball alone hasn't been enough on offence and Hess can't do it by himself on the mound.</p>
<p>But the attendance numbers show the return of pro baseball has been embraced by the B.C. capital, regardless.</p>
<p>The Seals have a strange end to the schedule thanks to the H1N1 virus scare in Mexico, which caused Tijuana to pull out before the start of the GBL season. The three home games against Orange County tonight, tomorrow and Thursday will be followed by three games against Calgary on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. There are then four game-less days before the Seals end the season with a four-night stand in Long Beach against the Armada from Aug. 28-31. The gap in the schedule next week represents the four nights the Tijuana Potros were to appear at Royal Athletic.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was a familiar refrain to Sunday's 12-7 loss to the Vipers at Foothills Stadium in Calgary. The Seals, as they have done often this season, got off to a good start as home runs by Hill and Josh Arhart, the latter's 11th of the season, keyed Victoria to a 3-0 first-inning lead.</p>
<p>But when the defensive dam breaks on these Seals, it usually starts with a small crack caused by a lazy drop-in blooper, broken-bat single or inopportune error that eventually results in a deluge. That's been the pattern all season and was repeated Sunday in Calgary's crushingly decisive seven-run fifth inning that was enabled by a two-out Victoria defensive error that should have ended the inning far earlier.</p>
<p>"That kind of thing has happened to us more than we had hoped," said Victoria field-manager Darrell Evans.</p>
<p>"It's been the difference on the season and in many of the games we could have won. The guys are playing hard. That's all you can ask. But every time, stuff happens. When you're winning, those things are happening on the good side for you. We didn't get our share of the good breaks this year. It's been inconsistency more than anything.</p>
<p>"We all wish we had another 30 games to go. We haven't been that far off this season but we have not been rewarded for doing as many good things as we have. Now the guys want to finish off well for our home fans."</p>
<p>Former major leaguer Mac Suzuki came in as the closer in the ninth inning for Calgary and slammed the door on the Seals.</p>
<p>Brett Flowers, who along with Gabriel Riley has led Victoria from the bottom of the order lately, was at it again by going three-for-four.</p>

<p>Struggling hog producers have a big decision to make as the federal government puts up $75 million to help some cash-strapped operations wind down, a measure aimed at reducing over-supply.</p>
<p>Sask Pork chair Joe Kleinsasser said it's hard to say how many Saskatchewan producers might consider making a bid for a cut of the funding.</p>
<p>But Kleinsasser said the government appears to have worked with pork groups to come up with a program that will hopefully help the industry recover from a series of financial setbacks and emerge stronger than before.</p>
<p>"The tragic part of this is the people who spent their whole lives building a business did a great job, worked hard and, at the end of the day through no fault of their own, will walk away with nothing," Kleinsasser said.</p>
<p>Farmers already facing a large debt load have to lay out even more cash if they want to exit the hog industry -- and the federal government won't be providing anyone with a "golden parachute," Kleinsasser said.</p>
<p>"If you want to leave the industry, you want to clean out your barns, you decommission your lagoons . . . that all costs money," he said.</p>
<p>The program also includes government-backed loans to hog operations that aim to weather the economic storm and spending for efforts to boost markets for Canadian pork.</p>
<p>Kleinsasser, a Rosetown producer, said in recent days there has been a price loss of $40 to $50 per market pig.</p>
<p>"It's unbelievable how folks have managed to hang on," he said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Pork Council says the H1N1 flu pandemic delayed a hoped-for recovery in hog markets. Initially dubbed "swine flu," the outbreak hurt hog prices even as world health experts maintained pork products are safe to eat.</p>
<p>The industry has in recent years also grappled with high feed costs, high exchange rates and new U.S. laws around food labelling.</p>
<p>In a statement, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture also applauded the restructuring plans, announced during the weekend, but said the details must be made available to farmers as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"The pork sector's impact on the economy is significant and Canada cannot afford to risk losing this vital industry. We are encouraged the government recognizes that investing in and assisting this sector now will allow for greater returns in the future," said CFA president Laurent Pellerin.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Association of Rural Municipalities said the survival of the hog sector is important for all of the province's producers.</p>
<p>"The failure of the hog industry in Saskatchewan would have a ripple effect where a portion of the feed grains market would also collapse," president David Marit said in a news release.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Party government in February announced a cattle and hog support program that gave producers a payment based on the size of their herd and asked the federal government to top up the funding. But Ottawa declined, with Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz saying he believed that approach could trigger a trade challenge.</p>

<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told Canadian doctors Monday their co-operation will be instrumental for the country to weather an anticipated second-wave outbreak of the H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq told physicians gathered for the Canadian Medical Association annual meeting in Saskatoon they got into the medical field for the "immeasurable satisfaction of saving lives and helping change lives for the better."</p>
<p>Given the current challenges posed by the H1N1 outbreak and a shortage of medical isotopes, Aglukkaq said, "the time to realize this ambition is now.</p>
<p>"What may come this fall is something that could test all of us, possibly to a limit we've never experienced," she said of the potentially difficult flu season ahead. "Whatever may come, I stress that we'll best meet the challenges and serve Canadians by co-operating."</p>
<p>That co-operation should include politicians, aboriginal leaders and medical professionals, she said.</p>
<p>"Every Canadian is counting on our successful collaboration," Aglukkaq told the 142nd annual gathering of doctors.</p>
<p>Doctors also had a brief window to ask Aglukkaq questions Monday, including a query about inconsistent policies across the country governing who will pay to protect health-care workers during a pandemic.</p>
<p>B.C. Dr. Victor Dirnfeld, past-president of both the CMA and the B.C. Medical Association, asked Aglukkaq to reason with the B.C. government after that province's medical health officer announced last month B.C. would not pay for additional medical costs such as antiviral medication or protective N95 masks and gowns for the doctors and nurses on the front lines of a pandemic.</p>
<p>"This is contrary to public health protection prophylactic procedures," Dirnfeld said.</p>
<p>Ontario and Manitoba have already agreed to cover such costs.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said she'll relay that concern to her B.C. counterpart.</p>
<p>Christopher O'Brien of the Canadian Association of Nuclear Medicine also raised concerns about the rising cost of tracking down and buying medical isotopes during the shortage prompted by a shutdown at Ontario's Chalk River reactor.</p>
<p>"It would be very frustrating if patient access was limited not only due to lack of supply, but inability to pay," O'Brien said, asking Aglukkaq if the government has a plan to cover these additional costs.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq responded this topic will likely be on the agenda for a provincial-territorial meeting of health ministers scheduled for September in Winnipeg. Meanwhile, research into alternative medical isotopes and diagnostic techniques is also key, she said.</p>
<p>But the query that prompted loud applause from delegates was about the federal government's commitment to Canada Health Infoway, a non-profit organization funded by the federal government to get electronic health information systems up and running. The $500 million the federal government announced in January for the organization is not yet flowing to doctors.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said she isn't aware of the timeline for the distribution of these funds, but would check.</p>
<p>The CMA annual conference continues until Wednesday.</p>

<p>IQALUIT -- By now, the high-risk groups are well known: Swine flu is bad news for pregnant women and youth. And like other viruses, it spreads easily among people in close quarters.</p>
<p>What has Inuit leaders worried is that this describes a good number of their people. Inuit are young, have high pregnancy rates and many live in small homes jam-packed with multiple families.</p>
<p>As Prime Minister Stephen Harper and his senior ministers sit down today for a cabinet committee meeting in Iqaluit, the people in the area will be among those who fear they will be hit hardest should the virus arrive as expected this fall.</p>
<p>Nunavut Premier Eva Aariak and Nunavut MP Leona Aglukkaq greeted ministers of the priorities and planning committee and the Prime Minister in the evening sun of the Far North on the airport tarmac after their three-hour flight from Ottawa. Jackets were not required, and a light breeze provided a welcome contrast to the humid heat of Ottawa.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister will stay in the North for a week-long tour that will take him to all three territories. His ministers however, will spend only one day in Iqaluit, a growing capital rushing to take advantage of the short summer construction season. The flurry of activity includes a new commercial building in the centre of town, new social housing, waste-water and paving upgrades and renovations to a recreation centre.</p>
<p>But the new social housing will barely put a dent in the backlog of people living in overcrowded homes across the territory. And it is this crowding that has the Premier, Ms. Aaariak, concerned.</p>
<p>“No one really knows the extent of how far this virus will go, but I do worry, because we have such a high shortage of housing in the north, how it could affect us,” said Ms. Aariak, in an interview with The Globe and Mail prior to Mr. Harper's arrival. “There's a couple of elements why I think Nunavut is being hit so hard. … Nunavut has a very high percentage of young population. And the underlying factor is Nunavut has for a long time had a high housing shortage where two or three families are living under one roof. So you can imagine if one individual in a household [gets sick], how rapidly it can spread within the household of two or three families.”</p>
<p>According to the 2006 census, the median age of the territory's 29,474 residents is 23.</p>
<p>But the youth of the population and the crowded homes are only part of the concern when it comes to battling a pandemic. The territory's population is spread out across 26 remote communities, raising serious logistics concerns for accessing health care.</p>
<p>Mary Simon, Canada's Inuit leader, put it bluntly to the premiers when she spoke with them on Aug. 6 in Regina at a gathering of the Council of the Federation.</p>
<p>“Inuit communities are simply not prepared for an H1N1 outbreak,” she said, according to speaking notes posted on the Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami website. “The Inuit population is likely to be affected disproportionately as it is a young population with a high pregnancy rate.”</p>
<p>Ms. Simon is calling for the creation of an immunization team that could deliver vaccines to communities, many of which have no health-care workers trained to give injections and monitor their effects.</p>
<p>She also wants an Inuit-specific component to the country's pandemic planning. Canada's Inuit live not only in Nunavut, but also the Northwest Territories, northern Quebec and Labrador.</p>
<p>The Premier said her officials continue to update their pandemic plan and that everything seems to be under control.</p>
<p>“Our main concern at this point is that we have people that are available to look after the individuals that need help,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Aglukkaq, who is hosting the Prime Minister today, did not make herself available for an interview. Her spokeswoman, Josée Bellemare, offered an e-mail statement on the minister's behalf.</p>
<p>“The development of a pandemic plan for a territory or province rests with the territorial or provincial government, however, the agency is available to provide support and guidance as requested and required,” Ms. Bellemare wrote. “The Public Health Agency of Canada and Health Canada are working with our territorial and provincial partners to find the best course of action to meet the needs of each region to address H1N1, including Inuit communities.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta's plan needs a little polishing, top officer of health says</b>

<p>Albertans counting on "herd immunity" to protect them from H1N1 influenza this fall could be overly optimistic.</p>
<p>That type of immunity occurs when the majority of a population gets vaccinated against a disease, acting as a buffer for those who aren't immunized.</p>
<p>"For most immunization programs, we like to get in the 75-to-80-per-cent range to really get the full benefit of herd immunity starting to kick in," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, during a press conference on Monday.</p>
<p>"We're going to do our best to promote the vaccine and we hope as many Albertans as possible take advantage of that opportunity."</p>
<p>Dr. David Swann, Alberta's Liberal party leader and a former medical officer of health for two regions, said to be properly prepared, the provincial government should do a poll to check on how many people intend to get immunized.</p>
<p>"We should find that out because if we're not going to achieve herd immunity we have to start making other decisions.</p>
<p>"And we need to know that sooner rather than later or you end up with understaffed wards and people who are upset about the lack of care. And worse things happen and people get angry about services that were supposed to be there and aren't."</p>
<p>Alberta is already struggling with unsatisfactory immunization rates and released a strategy to improve them. The Alberta Immunization Strategy (2007-2017) notes that in 2005/2006, 68 per cent of seniors--typically one of the most vulnerable groups -- received the annual recommended influenza vaccine, which is below the target of 75 per cent. The Alberta Health and Wellness report notes that "complacency about the importance of immunization is a growing concern."</p>
<p>In the United States, an advisory committee for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention prioritized which groups will get the vaccine first if only limited quantities are initially available.</p>
<p>This group includes pregnant women, health-care workers and emergency medical responders, people caring for infants under six months of age, children and young adults from six months to 24 years, and people aged 25 to 64 years with underlying medical conditions such as asthma or diabetes.</p>
<p>The advisory committee made those recommendations at the end of July. But in Alberta, guidelines on priority groups won't be in place until mid-September, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>"We're gathering evidence right now from the rest of the world on who the high-risk groups are for more severe disease."</p>
<p>Canada's National Advisory Committee on Immunization usually advises the Public Health Agency of Canada on priority groups for immunization each flu season. They have yet to issue a statement on the matter.</p>
<p>But Corriveau said that overall, Alberta is ready for its true flu season, which typically peaks in December and January.</p>
<p>The plan just needs a little polishing, he said.</p>
<p>"In my view, there is a lot of encouraging information that is coming," Corriveau said. "There has been no major shift in the virus so far since it first arrived in late March. The disease pattern has stayed the same."</p>
<p>As of Aug. 13,66 Canadians with the virus have died, including seven in Alberta.</p>
<p>"It's still, to us, an influenza virus that is behaving pretty much the same as all the other influenza viruses we're dealing with every year," Corriveau said. hbrooymans@thejournal. canwest.com</p>

<p>A Quebec mayor will avoid handshakes - one of a politician's favourite tools - to curb the spread of the H1N1 virus during municipal elections this fall.</p>
<p>Public health authorities are bracing for a more virulent outbreak of H1N1 this year, and the mayor of the municipality of L'Ancienne Lorette, just outside Quebec City, is taking the threat seriously and banning handshakes in his campaign.</p>
<p>"On the campaign trail, you meet tens of people every day. By avoiding to shake hands, we want to protect the health of our citizens," said Émile Loranger.</p>
<p>Municipal elections will be held in 1,100 cities and towns across Quebec on Nov. 1, at the onset of the flu season.</p>
<p>"We have to look beyond politics," Loranger said yesterday.</p>
<p>"It's not worth it to take risks when you know that kids are more vulnerable to the virus."</p>
<p>L'Ancienne Lorette is home to about 12,000 voters.</p>
<p>The mayor also noted his staff will avoid organizing public gatherings during the campaign.</p>
<p>Quebec public health authorities say it is premature to call for such drastic measures.</p>
<p>"We are closely monitoring the evolution of the virus and we think the best way to prevent infection is still to have good hygiene, such as washing hands regularly," said spokeswoman Dominique Breton.</p>
<p>Health authorities also recommend covering up coughs and sneezes with an arm, avoiding physical contact with anyone who might be sick and staying home if showing signs of the flu.</p>
<p>Kumanan Wilson, Canada research chairman in public health at the University of Ottawa, said people should not start to panic ahead of a second wave of swine flu.</p>
<p>"It's important to be conscious of the possibility of spreading the virus, but we need to see how the virus will start to evolve over the next weeks before we decide how important it is to limit social gatherings," Wilson said.</p>
<p>As of Aug. 13, the H1N1 virus had been linked to 66 deaths in Canada.</p>

<p>The expected surge in H1N1 cases this fall could challenge Canada's medical community like nothing before, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told Canadian doctors yesterday as she issued a rallying cry to physicians.</p>

<p>Here's what some visitors to edmontonjournal.com had to say about Alberta's H1N1 flu plan, which may mobilize retired doctors and nurses help care for the sick: - Don't people get it? Our health-care system is in such a mess that the Conservatives are begging old-timer medical personnel to come off the bench to play. see what happens when too many idiots vote Conservative? - One way or another, this country seems to aspire to Third World status. H1N1 could be the big opportunity we've been waiting for to show the world just how clueless and incompetent we really are. anyone remember saRs? Canada was somehow the only country outside of southeast asia to have an outbreak. H1N1 could be yet another glorious step toward our Third-World aspirations. - Pandemic plan hinges on retirees? Really?</p>
<p> Imagine this as the plot of a movie: Hard-working medical professionals are either brutally laid off or forced to do the work of three people as the powers that be rapidly slash their beloved health system without anything even resembling a plan. The workers who remain bravely shoulder the load but it takes its toll, burning many out and forcing them to retire or to leave the field due to injuries. Those who were laid off bravely pick themselves up and leave the field to try to make new lives for themselves. Fifteen years pass. somehow the system is still hanging on due to the dedication and hard work of its insufficient staff, but now a new crisis looms. a pandemic appears to be bearing down on the province, and in this hour of need those who were laid off or have retired willingly give up their new lives to return in triumph to save everyone. somehow, it just doesn't sound very plausible, even as a fictional story. - For the province to announce their plan to have retired health-care workers return to active duty to help out in a pandemic without consultation is unrealistic and poor planning. Perhaps former politicians and bureaucrats living off of generous provincial pensions should be trained to help out. - absolutely laughable that alberta Health would come to us on bended knee after the shenanigans they pulled on us in the '80s and '90s. The voters of this province get what they deserve, and unfortunately in this case, it could mean a lot of heartache. When the outbreak comes I'll be tucked away in my West Vancouver home. - speaking for my partner--a retired nurse who has been laid off twice by the alberta government -- you can be assured that she will devote 100 per cent of her time, skills and energy to her family and friends and will not go near a triage tent. - Has anyone bothered to ask retired doctors and nurses if they would be willing to return to work on the front lines of a pandemic? Not likely and not likely that they would want to do so in any great numbers. Many retire finally because of burnout, age or health reasons, so what is the incentive to be at risk on the front lines? another "looks good on paper" disaster plan based on assumptions that won't fly when the event comes.

<p>-It looks like the only new doctors we're going to see as long as Ron Liepert and Ed Stelmach are in charge will be the spin doctors.</p>
<p>- I find it very difficult to get a comment through to many Alberta government websites. Maybe this is how they can claim they get very few complaints about the way they do things.</p>
<p>-Don't you think if the patients at Alberta Hospital were well enough to be released into the community, it would have been done years ago?</p>
<p>- Somebody should explain to the Wild Rose Party that the Cash for Clunkers program doesn't apply to them.</p>
<p>-If members of the NDP really felt changing the party's name to the Democratic Party would leverage Obama populism in their favour, they'd first have to replace Jack Layton with someone who's personality is not the diametrical opposite of the U. S. president.</p>
<p>- The Charter of Rights and Freedoms should have come with a charter of responsibilities that you must assume as a Canadian citizen.</p>
<p>-Let's be realistic. If most people in the world knew where to find Edmonton--in the middle of nowhere-- do you really think they'd choose to spend their money here to see festivals, shows and sports they can see anywhere? Use our tax money to make the city more enjoyable for the people who live here. An Expo will come and go and we will be left with the deficit.</p>
<p>- Please stop complaining about potholes. The weather here is extreme. You live here, get over it.</p>
<p>-We held a family picnic in the park. There were nine large garbage receptacles near our site, yet the ground was littered with paper, plastic, and my one-year-old granddaughter's personal favourite, cigarette butts.</p>
<p>- Do city councillors really expect us to put our own litter in the garbage or our own butts into ashtrays?Do they really expect us to be mature, responsible adults?</p>
<p>-I think one of the most compelling reasons to build a high-speed rail line between Edmonton and Calgary is because both sets of city councillors appear to be sharing the same brain. This would allow them to pass it back and forth a bit more quickly.</p>
<p>- I am slowly getting old standing at the bus stop waiting for an ETS bus whose driver has no concept of a schedule or my need to get to where I'm going on time.</p>
<p>-There are plans to rebuild and refurbish the terminal at the <span class="companylink">London City Airport</span>, which is linked to London's financial district at Canary Wharf. It's a pity the same can't be said here.</p>
<p>- Why bother picking the seeds out of</p>
<p>a raspberry. Stop wasting your time and eat it whole.</p>
<p>-There have been so many fatal car crashes this summer due to alcohol. I feel sorry for the police who must deal with the aftermath.</p>
<p>- The cute chick driving on Boudreau Road in St. Albert while brushing her hair and talking on her cellphone scares me.</p>
<p>-You should do your hair and makeup at home, not while you are trying to drive by steering with your knees and swerving in and out of traffic.</p>
<p>- So a venter doesn't believe bike/ pedestrian accidents cause critical injuries.</p>
<p>My father was hit by a cyclist, knocked down, broke several ribs and suffered a fatal heart attack.</p>
<p>-It is the lane adjacent to the stopped emergency vehicles that is required to slow to 60 kilometres an hour, not all lanes.</p>
<p>- Is the media giving H1N1 flu such abundant coverage because it's a</p>
<p>statistically valid public health threat or because it merely fits the bill as the killer pandemic they've been so sensationally hyping over the years?</p>
<p>-When I was growing up, I was taught that when two people are walking down the street, the gentleman would always walk on the outside. Was I the only one taught this?</p>
<p>- I don't like being called "dear" by sales clerks, hospital staff, waitresses, and anyone else not related to me. I find it condescending and annoying.</p>

<p>The expected surge in H1N1 cases this fall could challenge Canada's medical community like nothing before, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told Canadian doctors Monday as she issued a rallying cry to physicians.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq told physicians gathered for the Canadian Medical Association's annual meeting in Saskatoon they got into the medical field for the "immeasurable satisfaction of saving lives and helping change lives for the better."</p>
<p>"What may come this fall is something that could test all of us, possibly to a limit we've never experienced," she said of the potentially difficult flu season ahead.</p>
<p>"Whatever may come, I stress that we'll best meet the challenges and serve Canadians by co-operating."</p>
<p>That co-operation includes politicians, aboriginal leaders and medical professionals, Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>"Every Canadian is counting on our successful collaboration," she told the annual gathering of doctors.</p>
<p>H1N1 has been linked to 66 deaths in this country, according to the latest numbers from the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>The conference continues until Wednesday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>New administrator to give UW bigger world presence</b>
</div><div>By Luisa D'Amato   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>285 words</div><div>18 August 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO</p>
<p>Sue Horton, a former top administrator at Wilfrid Laurier University, has moved over to University of Waterloo, where she will play a key role in expanding the university's international involvement.</p>
<p>"We seek to expand Waterloo's presence in the world by providing international opportunities for our Canadian students and by attracting more international students to Waterloo," said Horton, who is UW's new associate provost of graduate studies.</p>
<p>Included in her mandate is doubling the number of graduate students to 8,000 by 2017, up from 4,000 now. An added goal is having 30 per cent of those students be foreign, up from 20 per cent now.</p>
<p>This can be accomplished, in part, with graduate programs for professionals all over the world, relying partly on distance education, Horton said.</p>
<p>For example, Horton - an economist who specializes in international health issues - began an online master's program in public health that used innovative techniques. Students far from campus watched and commented on an online presentation by another student. They didn't have to move to Waterloo to become students there. These online teaching techniques lead to valuable skills for professionals in a global environment, Horton said.</p>
<p>"Increasingly . . . people in public health laboratories and agencies have to collaborate with people they've never met," in situations such as discussing the H1N1 flu pandemic, she said.</p>
<p>Horton, who was vice-president academic at Laurier, also wants to increase the international experience for students at UW. That means working with others to increase the types of foreign co-op placements and short-term student exchanges, she said.</p>

<p>SASKATOON</p>
<p>Canada's health minister says doctors need to stand together with the federal government to face a possible H1N1 flu resurgence this fall, but physicians say they need more help from Ottawa to prepare for the pandemic.</p>
<p>Leona Aglukkaq told doctors at the Canadian Medical Association's annual meeting in Saskatoon that they have a key role to play in preventing the spread of the virus, in treatment and in educating patients.</p>
<p>"You are … indispensable allies in our quest to minimize, as much as possible, the spread and impact of H1N1 flu virus," Aglukkaq said Monday.</p>
<p>"With the possibility of a stronger second wave to come in the fall, we need to maintain our vigilance. We need you to stand together with us."</p>
<p>Aglukkaq told doctors that Ottawa is working with drug maker <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> to develop a safe and effective vaccine. One is on track to be ready by November, she said.</p>
<p>"Many are now asking the question: ‘Who gets vaccinated first?' We recognize this is a complex decision and it's one we're not taking lightly," said Aglukkaq. "We're gathering information to determine who is most affected by the virus and why. This will inform our vaccine priority planning."</p>
<p>But some at the meeting say Aglukkaq's speech lacked details that could help doctors and patients. Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, who is also a physician, said doctors need more information to allow them to have conversations this summer with their patients, especially those who are most at risk, such as pregnant women and people with underlying conditions.</p>
<p>"There are many things that need to be done and we're not hearing anything in terms of specifics from this minister," said Bennett.</p>
<p>"We don't hear a plan for what will happen from now until November in terms of anti-virals."</p>
<p>Bennett also said physicians are expressing concern that they may not be able to do their usual flu-shot clinics if they're looking after increasing numbers of sick people because of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Ouellet, the outgoing president of the Canadian Medical Association, acknowledged that Aglukkaq's speech was short on details. He told reporters that doctors really want to see an H1N1 vaccine plan that includes who should get the vaccine first.</p>
<p>"We need to have that. The primary doctors, they need to have information," said Ouellet. "This is important and it will be more important to what we should do if there's a real pandemic, a real crisis during the fall."</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq speaks at the Canadian Medical Association annual meeting in Saskatoon on Monday. An H1N1 flu vaccine is expected to be ready as soon as November. Geoff Howe, The Canadian Press    </p>

<p>Zambia</p>
<p>Ex-president cleared</p>
<p>on corruption charges</p>
<p>A magistrate acquitted former Zambian president Frederick Chiluba of corruption charges yesterday after a six-year trial in a ruling that overjoyed his supporters but frustrated clean-government campaigners in Africa.</p>
<p>Chiluba, 63, was accused of diverting $500,000 of state money into accounts to pay for an extravagant lifestyle when he served as Zambia's first democratically elected leader from 1991 to 2001.</p>
<p>Two co-defendants, former executives of a financial services company, were found guilty of receiving stolen money from the Zambian intelligence services. They both were sentenced to five years in jail.</p>

<p>Leader to resume duties</p>
<p>after catching swine flu</p>
<p>The office of Costa Rican President Oscar Arias says he will resume public activities after catching swine flu and spending a week in quarantine.</p>
<p>Arias, 69, has been working at home and communicating by phone and email since announcing he had swine flu. Health officials said the president received treatment and is no longer infectious. His asthma was an additional risk factor.</p>

<p>The attacks - coupled with another bombing that killed seven elsewhere in the northwest yesterday - showed the Muslim extremists can still sow violence and fear despite losing Swat to the military and reportedly their top leader to a U.S. missile strike on Aug. 5.</p>

</p>
<p>ST. CATHARINES, ONT. -- The Canadian Tour will likely expand next year, adding up to five new tournaments to its schedule.</p>
<p>Commissioner Richard Janes said yesterday he's close to nailing down a new golf tournament for British Columbia's Okanagan Valley and has talked with sponsors and local organizers in Hawaii about two other new events.</p>
<p>He wouldn't reveal the other two possible locations and said firm announcements on any of the five aren't quite imminent.</p>
<p>“When the [sponsor's] money is in the bank, it'll be imminent,” he joked yesterday at St. Catharines Golf & Country Club, site of the Canadian Tour Championship in early September.</p>
<p>The developmental tour, which has produced such PGA Tour stars as Mike Weir, Chris DiMarco and Stuart Appleby, has been bulking up over the past few years, adding events and expanding its geographic footprint.</p>
<p>The 2009 season has included new stops in Chile, Argentina and Costa Rica. It also had four Mexican dates, but three of those were postponed amid the country's swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Janes confirmed yesterday that two of the missed tournaments have been rescheduled for September – the Iberostar Riviera Maya Open near Cancun and the Riviera Nayarit Classic near Puerto Vallarta.</p>
<p>He said moving the Mexican tourneys to the fall will actually be a blessing for the tour's players, because it gives them an extra couple of weeks of competition before heading to the PGA Tour's qualifying tournament, or Q-school, in mid-October.</p>
<p>A tournament in the Okanagan would bring to 11 the number of stops on home soil, assuming the current 10 carry on next year. This week's event is in Montreal and then the tour returns to Ontario for the Seaforth Country Classic and the Canadian Tour Championship, its flagship event.</p>
<p>Janes said the tour has gone “unscathed” by the economic downtown this year, and he's bullish on expansion. However, he acknowledged 2010 will be challenging as potential sponsors shift their marketing dollars to the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.</p>
<p>“I'm not expecting miracles in 2010,” he said. “That's [the Games] where all the money is going to be.”</p>
<p>St. Catharines, opened in 1899 and overhauled and expanded in the 1940s by famed architects Stanley Thompson and Robert Trent Jones, is a new venue for the Tour Championship.</p>
<p>The tournament's other new wrinkle this year is a larger purse, its biggest in history – $250,000, up from $235,000 in 2008.</p>

<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>WARLORD RETURNS TO AID REGIME IN POLL</p>
<p>Hamid Karzai, the president of Afghanistan, provoked international condemnation Monday after he allowed a notorious warlord to fly back to Kabul from exile to help bolster support for his re-election in Thursday's poll.</p>
<p>Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum arrived from Turkey hours after an official statement from Karzai's palace announced that he was free to return.</p>
<p>The charismatic Uzbek leader arrived just 24 hours before campaigning was due to halt in what was viewed as a last-minute gambit by Karzai to secure an ethnic bloc vote that had seemed likely to split in recent weeks.</p>
<p>Dostum has a reputation as one of Afghanistan's most brutal leaders from the 1990s civil war onward. He is notorious for disciplining a thieving soldier by running him over in a tank and faced allegations --which he denies -- that his forces oversaw the suffocation of up to 2,000 Taliban prisoners packed into shipping containers in 2001.</p>
<p>EX-WIFE IGNITED WEDDING TENT BLAZE</p>
<p>DUBAI - A fire at a wedding that killed 43 women and children was started by the groom's spurned former wife, police sources said Monday.</p>
<p>Maids saw the woman, 23, pouring gasoline over the marquee in which the female guests were celebrating in a town west of Kuwait City.</p>
<p>She was later arrested and confessed, saying she was upset over her "bad treatment" from the groom, who had divorced her.</p>
<p>Col. Mohamad al-Saber, spokesman for the interior ministry, said: "We have identified the perpetrator, who confessed to committing the crime for personal reasons."</p>
<p>The fire, on Saturday evening, took hold at immense speed. "There were a couple of hundred women in the tent," Abdullah al-Zafeeri, whose mother and sister were among the injured, told local reporters.</p>
<p>Many of the women and children, who were segregated from the men as is conventional for Gulf weddings, died after being caught in a stampede for the only exit.</p>
<p>WOMAN SET TO GIVE BIRTH TO 12 BABIES</p>
<p>TUNIS, Tunisia - Move over Octomom, several British media outlets are reporting a woman in Tunisia is about to give birth to 12 babies -- six boys and six girls.</p>
<p>The unnamed mother is said to have conceived the babies with the aid of fertility drugs after suffering several miscarriages. She reportedly told doctors she was "feeling fine and looking forward to hugging her six boys and six girls."</p>
<p>The mother is apparently nine months pregnant and in good health.</p>
<p>Pregnancy with multiples raises the risk of complications for mothers and babies, according to the society for obstetricians and gynecologists of Canada.</p>

<p>FORMER PRESIDENT CLEARED OF THEFT</p>
<p>ZAMBIA - Zambia's former president, Frederick Chiluba, was cleared of theft Monday after a five-year investigation raked over the diminutive leader's taste for designer suits and platform-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>Supporters of the man who led Zambia for 10 years packed the Lusaka magistrates' court, normally the province of petty criminals, for the 445-page verdict, which took six hours to read.</p>
<p>As Johns Chinyama, who heard the case, pronounced "not guilty and acquitted" on the first of six charges of theft, the courtroom burst into applause and scores of people cheered outside.</p>
<p>Moments later, Chiluba, who stands a little over five feet, even in his heels, was escorted through the ululating crowd, clad in a beige suit complete with a matching turquoise silk tie and handkerchief.</p>
<p>His acquittal contrasts sharply with the outcome of a civil case in London two years ago, when a British judge ordered Chiluba to repay US$37.6 million to Zambia's government.</p>

<p>MATADOR, 67, RETURNS TO RING</p>
<p>Britain's only matador is to return to the ring at the age of 67, more than five years after his doctor ordered him to retire.</p>
<p>Frank Evans will don his suit of lights, pick up his cape and sword, and delight the crowd at the bullring in Benalmadena later this month.</p>
<p>The Salford grandfather of five, known as El Ingles since killing his first bull in 1966, is the only British bullfighter to earn the accolade of "matador de toros" and the oldest torero on Spain's bullfighting circuit.</p>
<p>And he is certainly the only matador to attempt a comeback following a quadruple heart bypass and knee replacement surgery.</p>
<p>"I tried retirement and it didn't suit me," Evans told The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p>"If a bull doesn't put an end to it I will quite happily continue for as long as I am physically able."</p>
<p>ONE KILLED IN REST HOME ROBBERY</p>
<p>BRUSSELS - A pair of armed men robbed two retirement homes in Brussels on Monday, killing one employee and injuring another during their crime spree, police said.</p>
<p>Two armed men turned up at the home in the tony, leafy southern suburb of Uccle mid-morning demanding money, a police spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The pair had carried out a robbery at another rest home in the city earlier in the morning, before attacking the Home Brugmann, according to police.</p>
<p>"Two members of staff put up resistance and were hit by bullets," during the raid at Home Brugmann, where 125 elderly people live, the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>"One of the victims succumbed to their wounds," she added.</p>
<p>There was no resistance to the armed criminals during the first attack and no one was injured there.</p>
<p>On both occasions the robbers fled on motorbike with an unknown amount of cash.</p>
<p>One of them was later arrested, Le Soir newspaper's website said.</p>
<p>SCHNAPPS PARENTS GO TO TRIAL</p>
<p>VIENNA - The parents of a four-year-old girl who drained a bottle of schnapps when she was left unattended went on trial Monday in Vienna.</p>
<p>The girl had been taken to hospital on Jan. 28 where tests showed she had a blood alcohol reading of 2.5 grams. The legal limit for drinking and driving in Austria is 0.5 grams of alcohol per litre of blood.</p>
<p>The prosecutor alleged that the young parents had shown a lack of responsibility by leaving the child with her 17-year-old aunt and not locking up the alcoholic drink.</p>
<p>They were also accused of failing to care for the child, after doctors said she showed signs of physical neglect.</p>
<p>The young aunt, who is also on trial, said she had left the child unattended for a brief period to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p>The three accused have pleaded not guilty, telling the court that the schnapps had been bought by the girl's grandfather in Serbia and none of the couple's other two children had had the idea of tasting it until then.</p>
<p>The court was adjourned indefinitely pending further medical opinion.</p>

<p>The helicopter, one of the world's most technologically advanced, was scrapped by the Pentagon for its high cost. Obama revealed on Monday it would have had an onboard kitchen.</p>
<p>"Among its other capabilities, it would let me cook a meal while under nuclear attack. I'll tell you something. If the United States of America is under nuclear attack, the last thing on my mind will be whipping up a snack," he quipped.</p>
<p>DRUG SMUGGLERS TIED TO CALIF. FIRE</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES - Wildfire investigators in California are looking for marijuana growers tied to a Mexican drug cartel they suspect of igniting a blaze that has charred more than 87,000 acres of a national forest.</p>
<p>The La Brea Fire, which erupted Aug. 8 in the Los Padres National Forest in the remote Santa Barbara County mountains northwest of Los Angeles, is believed to be the first major wildfire in the state caused by drug traffickers, U.S. Forest Service spokesman Jim Turner said on Monday.</p>
<p>A joint statement issued Saturday night by the Santa Barbara County sheriff's office and the forest service said the blaze was sparked by a "cooking fire in a marijuana drug trafficking operation ... believed to be run by a Mexican national drug organization."</p>

<p>PRESIDENT RECOVERS FROM SWINE FLU</p>
<p>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica - Costa Rican President Oscar Arias has recovered from a bout of H1N1 flu and will return to his normal routine today, his office said on Monday.</p>
<p>"He's not coming to work today, but will come tomorrow," said Manuel Morales, a spokesman for the Costa Rican presidency.</p>
<p>Arias, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1987, has been working from his home since contracting a mild case of the swine flu more than a week ago.</p>
<p>The Costa Rican president, 68, was the first head of state known to be infected with the H1N1 virus, which has spread around the world since April and could eventually affect two billion people, according to global health authorities.</p>
<p>Arias had been considered a higher-risk case because he also suffers from asthma. While most cases of H1N1 worldwide have not been serious, people with other illnesses may be more likely to suffer severe effects from the virus.</p>
<p>GANG KILLS EIGHT IN MEXICO ATTACKS</p>
<p>CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico - An armed gang killed eight people in a bar in Ciudad Juarez, and 17 others died in suspected drug attacks in northern Mexico in a 24-hour period, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>Almost 10,000 people have died in suspected drug violence, particularly in northern border areas, since the start of 2008, amid a military crackdown on the country's powerful cartels.</p>
<p>At least six attackers burst into a bar in the border city of Ciudad Juarez in the early hours of Monday, spraying it with bullets and killing the owner, his wife and six others, the local prosecutor's office said.</p>
<p>Four others were seriously hurt, a statement said.</p>
<p>Another armed gang killed six men on Sunday afternoon in a house near the same border city across from El Paso, Texas, the statement added.</p>
<p>The other deaths all occurred in the same northern Chihuahua State, home to Ciudad Juarez, Mexico's most violent city, where almost 1,300 people have been killed this year. President Felipe Calderon has deployed more than 36,000 troops across the country to crackdown on organized crime.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hog producers anxious to grab $75-M lifeline - Farmer needs loan 'right now'</b>
</div><div>By Arielle Godbout </div>
<div>592 words</div><div>17 August 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba hog farmers desperate for a lifeline are awaiting details of the federal government's $75 million aid package with anticipation and lingering questions over whether the money will fully address the industry's woes.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said hog producers would be able to access the restructuring money in one of two ways: through government-backed loans, or as funding to help them close their farms, in turn easing oversupply issues.</p>
<p>But exact details of the plan that was announced Saturday were not immediately available -- Agriculture Canada's website indicated they would be released over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>Wim Verbruggen, who's raised hogs for 15 years, is facing the possible closure of his operation and said he desperately needs a loan -- but he's not sure whether he'll qualify under the government's program.</p>
<p>Verbruggen sells his hogs to Maple Leaf based on U.S. market prices, which are now below his production costs, he said.</p>
<p>"We are losing $40 on a market hog," he said Sunday from his farm in Rivers, about 40 kilometres northwest of Brandon.</p>
<p>If market prices don't rise soon, Verbruggen said he'll be unable to pay his bills within three months.</p>
<p>"In November, I'm going to have a problem," he said. "When I cannot pay my bills, I cannot buy feed anymore."</p>
<p>If it reaches that point, Verbruggen said, his only option will be to sell all his sows and close his farm.</p>
<p>It's a reality he witnessed only last week, when a neighbouring farmer shut down his own hog production.</p>
<p>Verbruggen said he's approached every major bank in Canada in hopes of securing a loan, but has been turned away each time.</p>
<p>He's hoping the outcome will be different with the government-backed loans, especially since he's running out of time.</p>
<p>"I need a loan, but I need it right away," he said. "That's what we need to survive the next three months."</p>
<p>Despite his bleak future, Verbruggen said he doesn't want to consider leaving the hog industry.</p>
<p>"I'm trying to survive because you always have bad times, but after that, you sometimes have good times."</p>
<p>Many farmers have no choice but to shut down their farms, said Karl Kynoch, president of the Manitoba Pork Council.</p>
<p>Kynoch said he's been in touch with a lot of people who have scrambled to secure whatever financing is available -- from emptying their savings account, to applying for bank loans, to taking out mortgages on their properties.</p>
<p>These farmers have too much debt to consider another loan, he explained, and their only option is to transition out of the industry.</p>
<p>"I would expect that the exiting program, there will be a lot of people who want to get into that," he said.</p>
<p>So many people, in fact, that Kynoch's concerned there won't be enough money for everyone who needs it.</p>
<p>Pork producers were originally lobbying the government for an aid package of $800 million.</p>
<p>The hog industry started to dip about two-and-a-half years ago, said Kynoch, when the strong Canadian dollar sent export prices tumbling. The problem was exacerbated by high feed prices, he said.</p>
<p>Just as the industry looked like it might be ready to bounce back, the "swine flu" moniker for the H1N1 influenza pandemic caused some countries to close their borders to pork imports.</p>

<p>Medical isotopes and the H1N1 flu virus will be the focus of Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq's speech today to delegates at the Canadian Medical Association (CMA) conference in Saskatoon.</p>
<p>"I'll touch on these. These are two huge international issues," Aglukkaq said in an interview Sunday.</p>
<p>She said it's important for the government to work with the CMA and the medical profession, as they have in the past on other issues.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, was first detected this spring in Mexico and spread to countries around the world, including Canada.</p>
<p>Health and government officials are working to stockpile medication and prepare for a possible new wave of cases later this year as the weather changes and children head back to school.</p>
<p>"It's going to impact Canadians in the fall," Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>A worldwide shortage of medical isotopes, used to conduct a host of diagnostic tests, was sparked by the shutdown of a nuclear reactor in Chalk River, Ont. The reactor will not be operational until at least 2010.</p>
<p>Regarding the ongoing debate between private and public health care, which may be a particular focus for some CMA delegates, Aglukkaq said she'll be happy to discuss the issue if asked during the question and answer session which follows her speech. It will be Aglukkaq's first time addressing the CMA convention.</p>
<p>She reaffirmed the federal government's commitment to a publicly funded health-care system.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said she is interested to hear from delegates and see the CMA annual report, and said the government is always open to new ideas that can improve the system.</p>
<p>"We support a publicly funded health-care system. I look forward to receiving the report," she said.</p>

<p>A handful of activists gathered at Peace Arch Park Sunday to protest a U.S. policy banning HIV-positive travellers from entering the U.S.</p>
<p>The rally, led by Surrey organizer Martin Rooney, coincided with a similar event in Fort Erie, Ont., near Buffalo, N.Y.</p>
<p>The protests were created to raise awareness about the decades-old policy targeting HIV-positive visitors. Implemented in the 1980s, the ban bars Canadians with HIV from entering the United States without a $131 waiver. The waiver allows two visits in six months.</p>
<p>"It's horrific that, in the year 2009, with all the advances in medication and HIV, that it is still considered a disease worse than swine flu," Rooney said.</p>
<p>"We're not closing the borders for swine flu and that is far more contagious than HIV could ever be."</p>
<p>The Barack Obama administration is re-evaluating the U.S. law and recommendations could be made as early as this evening when public commentary is closed.</p>
<p>Rooney was refused entry to the U.S. in November 2007 due to his HIV status. He was headed to Bellingham to shop when he was fingerprinted and asked to get a waiver if he wanted to cross.</p>
<p>Rooney said the waivers are difficult to obtain and are given on a case-by-case basis. He doesn't understand why a $131 waiver changes the situation for Canadian HIV-positive travellers.</p>
<p>"Either I'm a threat to the U.S. or I'm not. But $131 doesn't change that," he said.</p>
<p>Rooney suspects the ban will be lifted on World AIDS Day, Dec. 1.</p>
<p>Charles King, CEO of Housing Works NYC, was also a speaker at the protest.</p>
<p>He co-chaired an HIV/AIDS Research Summit in Washington, D.C., in June, which 60 Canadians couldn't attend because they were HIV-positive. Conference organizers were unsuccessful in obtaining waivers for their Canadian guests.</p>
<p>King said that about 67 countries have a ban on HIV-positive travellers. He said some Americans do not come forward for HIV treatment for fear of deportation or separation from family.</p>
<p>"If the U.S. wants to be a leader in the fight against AIDS, it has to start by eliminating any type of restriction on people with HIV status," he said.</p>
<p>Other speakers at the protest included Vancouver Centre Liberal MP Hedy Fry, Surrey-Green Timbers NDP MLA Sue Hammell and Surrey acting mayor Barinder Rasode. cchai@theprovince.com</p>

<p>My daughter and I are planning to visit China during August and September. Could you give us some advice to avoid swine flu (H1N1)?</p>
<p>When the H1N1 vaccine becomes available, we would urge everyone to be vaccinated because there will be enough vaccine for everybody, but we don't anticipate that happening until November.</p>
<p>At this point, clinical trials of the vaccine are ongoing, but it looks like, to get adequate immunity, people will need two doses of the vaccine about a month apart, which means you'd have to plan to have it well in advance of your trip.</p>
<p>Generally, after the last dose, you require at least two more weeks before your body has got enough immunity to protect you.</p>
<p>Because we don't have a pandemic vaccine now, the advice when travelling is to wash your hands frequently, and take along some alcohol-based hand sanitizer in case you don't have ready access to running water.</p>
<p>If you're coughing and sneezing, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or with your shirt sleeve.</p>
<p>Try to avoid contact with people who seem to be coughing, but it's not always easy, especially in a country like China, where it's pretty crowded.</p>
<p>People need to understand that (swine flu) is a dynamic situation and it changes from week to week. We've been through the first wave of H1N1 and we anticipate that come fall/winter, we'll see further activity and we don't know how intense that's going to be.</p>
<p>Travellers should check with HealthLink (780-408-5465, 1-866-408-5465), their doctor, the Public Health Agency of Canada ( www.phac-aspc.gc.ca)or[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca)or] the World Health Organization(www. who. int) before they travel to find out what the situation is in the country to which they're travelling. Sometimes, other countries put restrictions on people from countries where they think there is more(swine flu) activity than in their home country. They can put you in quarantine for a few days.</p>
<p>Even if you're not sick, you may have to undergo screening. Those are the kinds of things travellers should anticipate if they plan to travel this fall and winter.</p>
<p>If you are sick, if you are feeling like you have a fever and a cough, don't travel, or postpone your travel. If you do travel when you're sick, there may be screening of passengers in some places, and they might not let you on the plane.</p>
<p>People should carry with them the addresses of the Canadian Embassy where they're going in case they get sick there and they want to see a physician. Often Canadian Embassies can provide that to you.</p>
<p>The federal Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade also provides some advice on that on their website, www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca.Gerry[http://www.dfait-maeci.gc.ca.Gerry] Predy, senior medical officer of health, Alberta Health Services E-mail questions for Ask the Expert to czdeb@thejournal.canwest.com or mail them to Ask the Expert, Edmonton Journal, P.

<p>A Montreal woman who died Friday after getting the swine flu awoke only once from a medically induced coma after the birth of her son in June, asking weakly for "my baby," a friend of hers said.</p>
<p>Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni, 23, died Friday at Sacre-Coeur Hospital in Montreal, more than two months after being hospitalized for a high fever while in the final months of her pregnancy. Days later, after suffering severe respiratory problems, she was given a C-section and her son was born.</p>
<p>Her baby Yassine was reportedly healthy after some initial breathing problems.</p>
<p>Hajar Rougui, a good friend of Kaitouni, told reporters the woman was put into an artificial coma following the C-section and she hemorrhaged badly.</p>
<p>Kaitouni never really regained consciousness, Rougui said, and woke just once to say, "My baby, my baby." But she never got a chance to hold her child.</p>
<p>Officials said it was unclear whether the H1N1 flu, or complications caused by having the flu, killed her.</p>
<p>Kaitouni reportedly came to Canada from Morocco to join her husband a year ago. Described by a friend as "a ball of joy" who was always smiling, Kaitouni had hoped to have four or five kids and live in a big house.</p>

</p>
<p>Two Ottawa school boards are not considering keeping pregnant teachers at home despite a possible increased swine flu risk to that group.</p>
<p>Two Quebec City school boards on Friday announced that pregnant teachers will be kept out of classrooms in September for that reason.</p>
<p>"We have not made any determination of anyone not working as of September," Gordon Butler, chairman of the Ottawa Catholic School Board, said Sunday.</p>
<p>"Our pandemic program is evolving. We are always in close contact with the health office here in Ottawa. If things change, we will communicate that."</p>
<p>The chairwoman of the Ottawa-Carleton District School Board echoed Butler's comments.</p>
<p>"We are working continuously with Public Health," said Lynn Scott. "As information keeps changing, we will keep evolving our plan for addressing the situation. Our priority is to minimize risk to our students and to our staff."</p>
<p>The French Catholic board could not be reached for comment Sunday, but Georges</p>
<p>Orfali, president of the Conseil des écoles publiques de l'Est de l'Ontario, said Sunday the issue had not been addressed yet.</p>
<p>"The staff in the school board are not back until this week. So we will see how things are."</p>
<p>In West Quebec, the chairman of Commission scolaire des Portages-de-l'Outaouais, Jocelyn Blondin, said Sunday there are no plans to keep pregnant teachers out of the classroom for September.</p>
<p>In Gatineau, neither the Western Québec School Board nor the Commission scolaire des Draveurs could be reached Sunday.</p>
<p>A study published this month in the British medical journal The Lancet suggests that pregnant women are at a greater risk of hospitalization and death than the general population once contracting swine flu.</p>
<p>The two Quebec City boards' decisions were taken the same day that a young Montreal woman died of swine flu complications following the birth of her son. The woman, Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni, contracted the disease while pregnant.</p>
<p>Marie-Ève Bédard, a spokeswoman for Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc, said on the weekend that a policy announcement on H1N1 will be made on Aug. 24.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the chairman of the Toronto District School Board, John Campbell, said Friday a decision to keep pregnant teachers out of school in the fall "merits consideration," the Toronto Star reported.</p>
