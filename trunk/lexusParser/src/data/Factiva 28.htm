<p>Vaccine glitch delays H1N1 flu shots,</p>
<p>Oct. 31</p>
<p>Prevention. That's what the swine flu vaccine is supposed to be about. The whole idea of public health measures is to prevent illnesses so that doctors and hospitals don't have to deal with those who are already sick. Fix the problem upstream before you have to scramble with medical treatment downstream.</p>
<p>So I am astounded at how delicately everyone is stepping around the fact that this flu variant originated in a factory farm in Mexico. A similar drama played out a few years ago with the avian flu. It was clear that this disease originated in factory farms, but all attention was on how people infected each other and on how wild birds were carriers of the vector.</p>
<p>The elephant in the room is factory farming that breeds exceptionally toxic bacteria and viruses, which are resistant to many medications. If we were really interested in prevention, that's where we'd direct our energies.</p>

<p>H1N1 exposes ills of health system,</p>
<p>Oct. 30</p>
<p>How short-sighted can public health be? It could have staffed the places where thousands of people already congregate - colleges, universities and other work places that employ large numbers - or given money to these organizations so that they can help with employing staff to deal with the vaccination process.</p>
<p>Giving vaccines to 3 million people from 10 clinics is simply ridiculous - 300,000 per clinic? Three hundred clinics at the least should have been established so they would deal with 10,000 each.</p>
<p>Can no one see a viable solution to the chaos that now exists and that will only get worse as more people struggle to get their flu vaccine?</p>

<p>Within 15 minutes, Laura Delves' two young sons were in their Etobicoke pediatrician's office, the H1N1 vaccine injected, tears dried, and out the door.</p>
<p>"We are really relieved that we were given an appointment, so we could do this in a civilized manner," Delves said Sunday morning at the Westway Medical Clinic in Etobicoke.</p>
<p>But it was a different story at public health clinics across Greater Toronto Sunday, where demand for the H1N1 vaccine continued to create daunting lines.</p>
<p>As the city and province prepare to ramp up access to the vaccine - 10 public health clinics will be operating in Toronto Monday, and more family doctors will be giving out shots - amid an unexpected reduction in supply, Canada's top public health officials are admitting they underestimated the demand.</p>
<p>"Three or four weeks ago, what we could not anticipate was the number of people that are interested," Dr. David Butler-Jones, the chief public health officer, told CTV's Question Period Sunday.</p>
<p>But that was before the recent deaths of three Ontario children who caught H1N1 - another death is still unconfirmed - put a human face on the virus and galvanized Canadians to seek vaccinations for themselves and their families.</p>
<p>The city's public health department has sent almost 250,000 H1N1 flu vaccine doses to local hospitals and more than 100,000 to physicians' offices to reduce lineups at public health clinics.</p>
<p>Westway was one of more than 200 Toronto doctors' offices that received the vaccine last week. Westway's Dr. Leah Harrington said she received a note from the public health department on Wednesday telling her the vaccines she requested would not be available. However, on Thursday morning a box arrived with 500 doses.</p>
<p>On Friday, the clinic started giving the shots to their patients, and on Sunday morning at 9 a.m., a line of 100 people was out the door, with wait times of about an hour.</p>
<p>"It gives us peace of mind to provide these to our patients," Harrington said between appointments Sunday, her regular day off. "My patients love it. Who wants to stand outside for hours with three little kids?"</p>
<p>But at the Vellore Village Community Centre in Vaughan, some lined up in the dark before 4 a.m., even though the clinic wasn't scheduled to open until noon.</p>
<p>Lineups were also long at the Ray Twinney Complex in Newmarket and at the Halton Region administration complex in Oakville.</p>
<p>Monday was the day vaccinations were to be available to nonpriority groups, but a dramatic reduction in the vaccine supplied to the province - about a quarter of what had been expected - means it will continue to be given only to high-risk groups.</p>
<p>At a news conference Sunday, Ontario's Health Minister, Deb Matthews, said only people in the priority groups will receive the vaccine, but patients will not be asked to prove their eligibility or provide a doctor's note.</p>
<p>"We fully respect and honour the people of Ontario" to follow the ministry's guidelines, she said.</p>
<p>Shots are being given to people aged six months to 65 years with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women with chronic medical conditions or more than 20 weeks pregnant, children from 6 months to under 5 years of age, persons living in remote and isolated areas, health-care workers, and those providing care to persons at high risk who cannot be immunized or may not respond to vaccines.</p>
<p>Public health clinics are also coping with a shortage of vaccine from manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. It will only be able to produce about 400,000 doses of the vaccine this week, instead of the million or so doses officials expected, due to a production problem.</p>
<p>"GSK overstated their amounts," Canada's Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told CTV. "They will continue to produce the vaccine. But we will continue to work with them as we roll out the vaccine."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones defended the planning behind the public vaccinations. "If a year ago we knew exactly what the virus was, what the pandemic was going to be, then the production of vaccine could have taken place," he told CTV.</p>
<p>"But we're actually living in real time. We're producing vaccine while we're testing it, while we're distributing it and while we're giving it."</p>
<p>Family doctors and private clinics are only receiving vaccines after Toronto Public Health's clinics are fully stocked, said Mary Margaret Crapper, a spokeswoman for the health unit.</p>
<p>Crapper said doctors will receive less than they asked for, due to the national shortfall, but the 112,000 doses provided to doctors is more than 10 times the amount already handed out at the health unit's own vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>In Toronto, private medical clinic Medcan, on York St., has said it will vaccinate any member of the high-risk group at no charge - whether or not they are a member of the clinic - as long as they come equipped with a referral from public health officials.</p>
<p>Medcan's CEO Shaun Francis was chief fundraiser for Conservative leader Tim Hudak during his leadership campaign earlier this year.</p>
<p>At Sunday's news conference, when Matthews was queried about the decision to send vaccines to Medcan, she said she would not question Canada's chief public health officer in the midst of a pandemic, but the province will be closely monitoring how private clinics administer the vaccine.</p>
<p>"When all of this is behind us, it is a question we're going to want to take a pretty good look at."</p>
<p>At the same news conference, Matthews and Ontario Chief Medical Officer Arlene King could not say when the province's vaccine supply will be restored, or how much they expect to receive next week. They could only say that all Ontarians who want the vaccine should receive it by Christmas.</p>

<p>Under the weather together</p>
<p>Officially, four NHL players have been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus, but that hasn't stopped the seasonal flu bug from walloping half-a-dozen teams, including the Edmonton Oilers, who had one confirmed case of H1N1 (Ladislav Smid), one suspected case (Lubomir Visnovsky) and six others (Mike Comrie, Gilbert Brulé, Tom Gilbert, Denis Grebeshkov, Dustin Penner and Ales Hemsky), all of whom missed time or were undermined by flu-like symptoms. The NHL is monitoring the progress of the virus, but beyond the usual precautions – no more sharing of water bottles, towels or razors; rapidly isolating any player showing signs of the illness – will not make flu shots mandatory for now. The Calgary Flames, meanwhile, had a creative solution when centre Dustin Boyd contracted the flu. Boyd's roommate, Eric Nystrom, temporarily moved out of their shared house, stopping by only to drop off some soup. Even then, Nystrom took no chances. He left the soup on the doorstep and then texted Boyd to say it was waiting for him outside.</p>

<p>Hall of Fame's Red Wing gets additions</p>
<p>The Detroit Red Wings make a rare trip to Toronto on Saturday, providing the opposition for the Maple Leafs in the annual Hall of Fame game. Three of four inductees from the class of 2009 have ties to the Red Wings, beginning with Steve Yzerman, who served 20 seasons as Detroit's captain – longest tenure in NHL history – and won three Stanley Cups along the way. Though primarily associated with the St. Louis Blues and Los Angeles Kings respectively, Brett Hull and Luc Robitaille joined Yzerman on the 2002 championship team, which at the time was said to boast as many as 10 potential Hall of Famers. Of that group, Igor Larionov is already in the Hall. The other candidates, all still active on some level, include Dominik Hasek, Chris Chelios, Nicklas Lidstrom, Brendan Shanahan, Sergei Fedorov and Pavel Datsyuk. Brian Leetch, the fourth player inductee, played the first 1,129 games of his NHL career with New York, but had a brief 15-game cameo with the Leafs at the end of the 2003-04 season.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yzerman sees Stamkos</p>
<p>Steve Yzerman, executive director of Canada's 2010 men's Olympic hockey team, will be in the house at the Air Canada Centre tomorrow night to scout a trio of Tampa Bay Lightning candidates: Martin St. Louis and Vincent Lecavalier – both of whom attended the summer orientation camp – and second-year centre Steven Stamkos, who didn't.</p>
<p>Stamkos is making a strong 11th-hour bid with a productive first month (10 goals in his first 11 games), and if Canada legitimately wants to consider him as a candidate for the team, they need to notify him of the possibility because he would then be subject to the International Olympic Committee's drug-testing protocols.</p>
<p>St. Louis, meanwhile, continues to make a strong bid for the team, recording a point in all 11 games this season, the sort of consistency they need to see. Yzerman and the rest of the managerial staff also plans to watch the San Jose Sharks play twice this week to assess their four candidates (Joe Thornton, Dany Heatley, Patrick Marleau and Dan Boyle).</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>"Their lineup is decimated, let's be realistic."</p>
<p>Anaheim Ducks coach Randy Carlyle strikes a rare note of sympathy for the Vancouver Canucks, who are</p>
<p>playing without starting goaltender Roberto Luongo, plus a sextet of regulars including top scorer, Daniel Sedin. Unhappily, for the Canucks, the schedule doesn't get any easier, with three games in the next four nights - a lone home date tormorrow against the Rangers, before embarking on two games in two nights in Minnesorta and Dallas on Thursday and Friday. Luongo could theoretically be back by then from that painful rib cartilage problem that has him sidelined.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Raps still waiting on Turkoglu; High-profile free-agent signing can't spur Toronto to victory against former team</b>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- BASKETBALL REPORTER</p>
<p>The Toronto Raptors signed Hedo Turkoglu for times like yesterday, when they find themselves in the guts of the game needing to make something happen.</p>
<p>At 6-foot-9, he can make plays off the dribble and he's got the confidence to take and make big shots down the stretch.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, he didn't really get a chance yesterday as the Raptors got lit up by the Turkoglu's old team, the Orlando Magic, 125-116 in front of 18,147 at the Air Canada Centre.</p>
<p>The Raptors failed to put the ball in the hands of their new playmaker as Orlando hung on after the Raptors tried gamely to rally back from a 22-point hole they dug themselves in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Turkoglu was a significant factor as the Raptors surged back – he scored 12 of his 14 points after the Raptors hit rock bottom, including nine while going four-of-four in the third quarter, and he also tossed in four assists and a pair of blocked shots.</p>
<p>But in the game's final five minutes, with the Raptors trailing by six points, Turkoglu was nowhere, with the Raptors initiating their offence through Jarrett Jack and Jose Calderon, their two-headed point guard. The results weren't pretty, as Toronto committed a pair of costly turnovers – one by Chris Bosh and the other by Jack – and Orlando point guard Jameer Nelson took control of the game with his dribble penetration into the heart of the Raptors defense. Turkoglu counted just one assist in the fourth quarter and a pair of too-late baskets when the game was out of reach.</p>
<p>“I'm trying to,” said Turkoglu when asked if felt comfortable asserting himself down the stretch in close games with his new team yet. “[Today] was better, but like I said before we have so many weapons, I just have to take my time and when my time comes I have to be more aggressive instead of passing up shots.”</p>
<p>Turkoglu earned his five-year, $53-million (U.S.) free-agent contract in part because he's bold enough to try and make plays down the stretch.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing with any of those guys who are good in those situations is they can handle missing, that's what it really comes down to,” said his former coach, Stan Van Gundy. “And in this world and in this game a lot of guys can't do that, they can't put the bad thing behind them. Hedo can really stink for three quarters and be the best player on the floor in the fourth quarter; I think that's an outstanding characteristic.”</p>
<p>The Raptors, 1-2, have yet to see it.</p>
<p>That Toronto had such a steep hill to climb can be traced to Orlando's mastery of their inside-outside attack where Howard punishes teams down low and their shooters take aim from beyond the three-point line. The Magic were shorthanded for the game as Vince Carter opted to rest a sore ankle he sprained on Friday; Mickael Pietrus was sent home with the flu and Rashard Lewis is serving a 10-game suspension after being found with an elevated level of testosterone in his system during the off-season.</p>
<p>But it didn't matter: Howard scored 24 points and grabbed 11 rebounds; little-used J.J. Reddick scored a career-high 27 points while playing 45 minutes, including hitting five-of-eight three-pointers. Ryan Anderson, a throw-in the Magic received from New Jersey in the trade that yielded Vince Carter was also five-of-eight from the three-point line as Orlando set a Raptors record by an opponent by hitting 17 threes, using just 32 attempts to do so.</p>
<p>“This is what they do,” said Raptors head coach Jay Triano. “They put shooters around Dwight Howard. If you take away the shooters as we tried later, then Dwight Howard goes crazy inside.”</p>
<p>Toronto shot 10-of-17 from the three-point line and 54.1 per cent from the floor to 43.9 by the Magic, but couldn't overcome Orlando's edge in offensive rebounding, free throws and triples.</p>
<p>Even fouling Howard and forcing him to make free throws didn't work, as the career 60-per-cent free throw shooter made 14 of his 16 chances as Bosh chipped in with a hard foul on his friend Howard that had them exchanging words.</p>
<p>Toronto got strong efforts from Bosh, who finished with 35 points and 16 rebounds, while Andrea Bargnani scored 22 of his 26 points in the second half, but Orlando was able to silence any Raptors run with a three pointer, it seemed.</p>
<p>“They played very well, that's the thing,” Van Gundy said. “It's not like they can walk into the locker room and say ‘well, we just didn't have it today.' They shot the hell out of the ball, their main three guys all played great and we were still able to come out with the road win.”</p>
<p>And the Raptors are still waiting to see what Turkoglu can really do.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>SCORESHEET</p>
<p>Notes Most NBA teams are being particularly cautious about the possibility of the H1N1 virus spreading throughout their club. The Orlando Magic opted to send forward Mickael Pietrus back to Florida when he demonstrated a fever rather than risk him infecting the team. … Vince Carter warmed up before the game but decided not to play when he tested his lateral movement with his sprained ankle. “He said if he didn't have to play any defence he'd be fine. I've had some guys before who don't play defence, but generally it's not something we encourage,” Magic coach Stan Van Gundy said. … Toronto Raptors star Chris Bosh said he was just making sure that Dwight Howard didn't get a three-point play when he grabbed his Team USA friend around the neck and held on in the fourth quarter. “It's hard basketball, it was a hard foul, but there are no hard feelings or anything.” Said Howard, “It's over with now. We are just trying to pound the ball inside and get to the free-throw line. It was the heat of the moment, it is over with.” … Magic forward Matt Barnes got a technical foul for appearing to step on Raptors centre Andrea Bargnani in the third quarter after they got tangled up. Bosh got a technical foul in the first quarter after arguing he'd been fouled by Barnes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Heir and there; Prince and duchess to celebrate Canada's ‘presence on world stage' in 12-city, four-province tour</b>
</div><div>MICHAEL VALPY   </div>

</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, arrive in St. John's tonight for an 11-day tour of Canada billed by the federal government as a thematic representation of Canadians' sense of place and identity.</p>
<p>It is the Prince of Wales's 15th visit to Canada and his wife's first – and the place-and-identity motif the Department of Canadian Heritage has come up with actually fits with their itinerary.</p>
<p>Heritage Minister James Moore calls the 12-city, four-province tour “a celebration of Canadian innovation, community building, national pride, and presence on the world stage.”</p>
<p>Nothing they're being asked to do is stuffy and formal except possibly meeting with premiers and the Prince's presentation of new colours – battle honours – to the three reserve regiments of which he is colonel-in-chief, two in Toronto and one in Montreal.</p>
<p>The government's chief tour organizer, Kevin MacLeod, the Canadian Secretary to the Queen, is a royal-visit pro.</p>
<p>He was one of the masterminds in 2002 behind getting the Queen, guided by Wayne Gretzky, to drop the puck for a ceremonial NHL face-off in Vancouver as a giant gold EIIR flashed on the JumboTron screen atop an “I Am Canadian” beer logo.</p>
<p>What the couple will do</p>
<p>Prince Charles and the Duchess will visit historic, preserved Newfoundland outports, green ventures on sustainable urbanization, sustainable fishing and local food production, architectural conservation projects, a botanical garden, educational institutions, cultural facilities and programs for student entrepreneurs, socially responsible business and holistic health, all things the Prince is interested in. In fact, his website stresses that much of what he'll be doing in Canada meshes with projects he gives his patronage to in Britain, which is something his Canadian friends, Galen and Hilary Weston, have tried to encourage.</p>
<p>The couple will visit Vancouver's Olympic and Paralympic Village, tour the headquarters of Cirque du Soleil in Montreal, celebrate the navy – 100 years old in 2010 – and meet privately with the families of soldiers serving and fallen in Afghanistan wherever the itinerary permits.</p>
<p>Prince Charles also will take part in the Remembrance Day ceremony at Ottawa's National War Memorial, an event which Mr. MacLeod said Prime Minister Stephen Harper particularly wanted the Prince here for.</p>
<p>The full itinerary is at http://www.visiteroyale-royalvisit.gc.ca/[http://www.visiteroyale-royalvisit.gc.ca/]</p>
<p>Charles speaks</p>
<p>Prince Charles will give four speeches – in St. John's, Victoria, Toronto and Ottawa – and make “remarks” when he meets with his regiments in Toronto and Montreal.</p>
<p>He writes his own speeches but, by custom, submits draft copies in advance to Canadian government officials “to ensure accuracies,” says Canadian Heritage, “such as historical background information.” It's also to make sure he doesn't get into hot water: the Prince has been outspoken on climate change, not an issue that tops the Canadian government's agenda.</p>
<p>Camilla visits</p>
<p>The Prince's late first wife, Diana, and his former sister-in-law, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, carried out many engagements on their own when they visited Canada. They were young, vivacious and there was intense public interest in seeing them. The Duchess of Cornwall, in contrast, will have only two engagements on her own during the visit. She'll tour the recently refurbished Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto and meet with conservatory students and visit a mobile osteoporosis facility in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Camilla's roots</p>
<p>In Hamilton, the Prince and Duchess will visit Dundurn Castle, built by the Duchess's great-great-great-grandfather, Sir Allan MacNab, premier of United Canada from 1854-56 and a rather unprincipled businessman who declared, “All my politics are Railroad” and who was suspected of extortion. He was still alive when Charles's great-great-grandfather, Prince Albert Edward, later King Edward VII, visited Dundurn Castle in 1860.</p>
<p>The GG rumours</p>
<p>With recent reports that Michaëlle Jean has intimated on her website that she, not the Queen, is head of state, there were bound to be stories that the Governor-General is busy undermining the monarchy.</p>
<p>Rumour 1: That Ms. Jean broke with convention and did not invite the Prince and Duchess to stay at her Rideau Hall residence. Not true. That's where they're staying.</p>
<p>Rumour 2: That Ms. Jean has never mentioned Prince Charles's mother, the Queen, in a speech. Not true. She has mentioned the Queen four times in the 574 speeches she has delivered since her inauguration in 2005.</p>
<p>To scotch Rumour 3 before it starts: If anyone notices that Ms. Jean takes protocol preference over the Prince at the Nov. 11 Remembrance Day ceremony in the capital, it's because she symbolizes the Queen.</p>
<p>Swine flu behaviour</p>
<p>The Prince and Duchess will not curtail handshaking. Mr. MacLeod said by convention there is no discussion of medical treatment given members of the Royal Family, therefore there would be no comment on whether the Prince and Duchess had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Neither is in a primary target group. Prince Charles will celebrate his 61st birthday two days after he leaves Canada on Nov. 14. The Duchess turned 62 in July.</p>

<p>For years, bring-your-kid-to-work day has been a chance to inspire career goals, and showcase just how mom and dad earn money for all those hockey and dance lessons.</p>
<p>But this year, there's a fringe benefit: For one day, kids can skip the sniffling, flu-ravaged classrooms, and hang out in offices stocked with hand-sanitizer bottles and adults who, one hopes, know to cough into their sleeves.</p>
<p>“Where are you going to be safe, unless you live in a bubble?” asks Lisa Deley, a customer relations worker at a TD bank branch in Thunder Bay, who is bringing her Grade 9 son, Ben, to work on Wednesday. “I think he's more exposed at school. There are a lot more hand sanitizers here.”</p>
<p>Even as schools close across the country – and Halloween was postponed in several Newfoundland communities this weekend – most companies, aside from hospitals, are going ahead with the annual event, which typically involves about 250,000 students. Employers are counting on common sense – that no one will bring their hacking, feverish kid into the office.</p>
<p>Although organizers across the country say cancellations have been rare, CBC Toronto is one company that has decided scrap the day because of the flu. (General Motors has also cancelled its group activities – a decision made earlier because of the recession – but individual parents are permitted to bring in their children.) A CBC spokesperson said the network cannot risk a large absenteeism rate among the 3,000 employees at its hub location. “It's a probably a surfeit of caution,” says Jeff Keay, spokesperson. “But a lot of [television material] originates from here.”</p>
<p>Hospitals, swamped with patients and distracted by pandemic planning, have also closed their doors to visiting students. Norfolk General Hospital in Simcoe, Ont., made the decision Friday, after consulting with other hospitals across the province. “It has been a very popular program in the past,” said Marylisa Forsyth, director of human resources whose own daughter will now have to stay home.</p>
<p>Sharon Delbridge, a Winnipeg fitness instructor will be bringing her daughter to her classes. She says the gym – where people are fastidiously wiping mats and equipment – is probably more germ-free then ever.</p>
<p>Besides, she adds, “they can got to a mall and catch something. I certainly don't think keeping her in school is going to keep her safer.”</p>

<p>In the largest vaccination campaign in Canadian history, public health officials are working feverishly to meet the demand for H1N1 flu shots. Last week, hundreds of thousands of Canadians stood in long lines to get jabbed and public health officials expect demand will also be high this week. In Thunder Bay, more than 7,000 people have been immunized, an effort co-ordinated by Darlene Binette, a public health nurse who manages the region's infectious disease programs.</p>
<p>Why are so many people clamouring to get vaccinated?</p>
<p>Certainly they've heard a lot in the media about illness. We have seen influenza-like illness in our community. The schools are calling the health unit and advising that they are seeing an increased number of children off sick. Our emergency department is seeing increased numbers – not just in our community, but in some of our branch offices as well. So people are concerned. What's it like at the H1N1 flu shot clinics in Thunder Bay? It's been extremely busy. We've had lineups, we've had to turn people away. … And we ran late just to accommodate those who are in the building.</p>
<p>How long are people waiting to get their shots? Probably anywhere from an hour to two hours of a wait, and some perhaps a little bit longer. How patient are people when they're waiting? Do things ever get out of hand?</p>
<p>We haven't had any fistfights yet, let's put it that way. People actually have been extremely good, they've been extremely patient for the most part. They recognize that we're working as hard as we can. We have lots of staff out to try and immunize, but we have noticed that these clinics tend to go a little bit slower than, say, a normal seasonal flu clinic because we do have to mix up the vaccine and people have more questions. … Obviously we've had some people that have been upset. Are any people trying to jump the queue? We do know that there have been individuals there that haven't probably fit that [priority] sequence and we have immunized them. Would you advise people to bring a book or pack a snack?</p>
<p>Absolutely! Snacks would be good. … Bring a book, be prepared to wait for a while.</p>
<p>What do people say to you or the other nurses giving the vaccines? I think they want to just have reassurance that this vaccine is safe, you know, because, again, they've heard a lot of hype about the fact that it hasn't been tested. They're certainly concerned about their children, they're concerned about any side effects. I think they want reassurance that this is the right thing for them to do, especially with their kids. And what do you tell them?</p>
<p>We certainly say that it is safe and that it has been approved and it is the right choice. I mean, certainly we've seen quite a bit of illness out there in the community, and so to protect yourself and to protect your family and to protect the people that you're working with or going to school with, then it is important to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>How long would you say it takes to vaccinate one person? Oh, it's hard to really judge. I mean, some people get in there within five minutes, from the time you draw up the vaccine, administer it and then the person leaves. … But often because they do have questions or they do have family members … it could take up to 20 minutes. Especially, if it's young children getting immunized, it's quite a process to get them to actually put that arm out! Have you been vaccinated yourself? Absolutely. I was the first one. And so have my children and my grandchildren – all been done.</p>

<p>aradwanski@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>For a brief time Friday night, the very different problems of the two most powerful Liberals in the country intersected in a city with more than enough troubles of its own.</p>
<p>Everything about the Ontario Liberals' convention was meant to help convey – to the rank-and-file, and to the few journalists gathered there – that Dalton McGuinty grasps the scope of the challenges ahead of him.</p>
<p>To begin with, there was the location. Much of Ontario has been hard-hit by the recession, but nowhere quite like Windsor – a place where, courtesy of the auto industry's collapse, the 14 per cent unemployment rate is by far the highest of any city in Canada. It is, as one Liberal put it, ground zero.</p>
<p>Then there was the program. Ordinarily, annual conventions – basically a payoff for grassroots members, who get to rub elbows with party elites – are chock full of all the rah-rah boosterism anyone can handle. But in the midst of their toughest period since taking office, Mr. McGuinty's Liberals knew that wouldn't cut it. Liberals turning up in a poverty-stricken town amid expense scandals, a $24.7-billion provincial deficit and the troubled response to H1N1 would have looked ludicrous spending the weekend congratulating themselves for a job well done.</p>
<p>So rather than rally the troops, Mr. McGuinty sought to engage them in a branding exercise. His aim is to paint himself as the premier willing to make the tough decisions, even if they're not the politically popular ones. So with a low-key speech and a question-and-answer session aimed at showcasing accountability and addressing head on controversies such as the new harmonized sales tax, he sought to convey that there's a steady hand at the helm.</p>
<p>Complicating his life considerably was that Michael Ignatieff – just about the least steady hand at any helm over the past while – seized upon this as an opportunity to try to right his own ship.</p>
<p>At the end of a brutal week in which he axed his chief of staff, following a brutal couple of months in which his election posturing (and subsequent climb down) contributed to plummeting polling numbers, the federal Liberal Leader made a surprise appearance in Windsor to speak to a rare friendly audience.</p>
<p>Mr. Ignatieff was not the weekend's keynote speaker; that honour officially belonged to Ted Sorensen, the former JFK speechwriter. (Mr. Sorensen's Saturday address, which focused on the responsibility and burden of governance, was widely considered the weekend's highlight.) But Mr. Ignatieff appeared to interpret that as his mandate anyway.</p>
<p>Organizers seemed to expect that Mr. Ignatieff would spend a couple of minutes introducing Mr. McGuinty, then head on his merry way. That was indeed how it initially looked, the exhausted-looking opposition leader flatly singing the praises of his provincial cousins. But it soon morphed into a 15-minute tub-thumper that concluded with a rousing call to arms against Prime Minister Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>Given the contrast with the otherwise sombre tone, not to mention the fact that it forced the Liberals to tighten the rest of the program, the effect was to make Mr. Ignatieff the star of the show. (With a bit of federal star power helping his cause, Mr. Ignatieff spent the rest of the evening posing for photos and welcoming delegates to his crowded hospitality suite.) But it also served to rather confuse things, distracting from Mr. McGuinty's intended message if not flat-out undermining it.</p>
<p>The behind-the-scenes relationship between senior federal and provincial Liberals, somewhat strained to begin with, is unlikely to improve as a result. That may cause some discomfort among the grassroots, most of whom consider themselves both federal and provincial members. But the bigger concern for both sides is the degree to which the Liberal brand – the one Mr. McGuinty was trying so hard to define – has become muddled.</p>
<p>Although damning with faint praise, it's fair to say that Mr. McGuinty's brand in Ontario is currently stronger than Mr. Ignatieff's; even with all his recent problems, the Premier remains ahead of his opponents in the polls. But it will be a herculean task for him to protect that brand over the final two years of his current mandate, as he tries to adapt it to his province's – and his government's – troubled times. The last thing he needs is another Liberal Leader piling his problems atop his own.</p>

<p>Before Frank Filice could speak a word his throat was caught by emotion and tears welled in his eyes. Just the mention of Evan Frustaglio's name was enough to send a flood of painful thoughts through his mind.</p>
<p>He gestured toward his own son, 13-year-old Sal, who had been Evan's linemate on the Mississauga Senators hockey team for four seasons. They were like brothers, Mr. Filice said. What more could he say?</p>
<p>Seeing his father overwhelmed, Sal turned away to hide his own tears.</p>
<p>Like so many of the hundreds of mourners who attended a visitation for Evan at a Woodbridge funeral home this weekend, Sal wore his hockey jacket last night. In his pocket he carried a logo of the Senators hockey club, which he planned to leave with Evan after he said his final goodbye.</p>
<p>Evan died of H1N1 influenza a week ago, a day after returning from a hockey tournament in London, Ont. An otherwise healthy 13-year-old, he had played well in three games that weekend despite his body aches and fever, but his condition quickly deteriorated Saturday. He vomited several times that night and the following day. His parents took him to a walk-in clinic Sunday afternoon but were told his lungs were functioning well. He collapsed in his bathroom Monday morning with his father, Paul, at his side. He never regained consciousness.</p>
<p>Evan's father, mother and younger brother greeted well-wishers with hugs and tears yesterday as they stood by his casket. The room was filled with mementos of Evan's hockey career. Jerseys from his teams were displayed next to his body, including the last one he wore, the jersey of the Mississauga North Stars, with an A for assistant captain on its left breast.</p>
<p>A slideshow of photos told the story of Evan's life: he and his brother Will dressed as Harry Potter for Halloween, he and his dad smiling on Christmas morning, and Evan tearing across the ice, hockey stick in hand, the number 93 jersey on his back. Hockey was an all-consuming passion to him.</p>
<p>Some of his friends and teammates wore black armbands with Evan's number in white One sat with his head bowed, wiping away a stream of tears as his mother tried to comfort him.</p>
<p>Mr. Filice said for many it was their first brush with death.</p>
<p>He was told of Evan's death on Monday afternoon. Their families were very close and often spent holidays together, he said. He immediately dialled the Frustaglios' number, but couldn't find the courage to hit the send button.</p>
<p>“It's been a very tough week,” he said. His own son couldn't sleep, he said. Their hockey team had a game scheduled the night Evan died, and there was silence in the dressing room beforehand. They dedicated the game to his memory and at the end, the 13-year-olds gathered at centre ice, their sticks pointed to the heavens in salute.</p>
<p>“He touched everybody. It's been terribly hard,” Mr. Filice said.</p>
<p>Well-wishers from across the country who had never met Evan but were moved by his death sent messages of condolence to the family. On Hockey Night in Canada Saturday, Don Cherry reserved a segment of Coach's Corner to pay tribute to Evan.</p>
<p>“I think his death has devastated the whole hockey world. We all feel tremendous loss,” said Tony Marchese, whose 10-year-old son plays against Evan's younger brother. He and his wife and two boys were at yesterday's visitation.</p>
<p>“We have our own 13-year-old son. We can feel what the parents are going through. It's just devastating.”</p>
<p>Evan's funeral will be held this morning at All Saints Roman Catholic Church on Eglinton Avenue in Etobicoke.</p>

<p>Who can get the shot?</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health staff will be screening flu-shot lineups this week, double-checking to make sure those who are waiting belong to one of the priority groups. They will also be asking people who have a fever or are sick to wait until they feel better before getting the shot. Those in priority groups include: • People under 65 with chronic health conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, heart conditions, HIV/AIDS and cancer</p>
<p>• Pregnant women</p>
<p>• Children older than six months up to four years old. Children five and up are not considered part of the priority group</p>
<p>• Health care workers</p>
<p>• Caregivers of infants under six months old and immunocompromised people</p>
<p>Where can I get the shot?</p>
<p>Clinics will be open across Toronto from Monday to Friday this week between 1 p.m. and 7 p.m. and on Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Lineups will be closed once the number of people waiting exceeds the number of doses available that day. Toronto Public Health will be posting notices on its website (www.toronto.ca/health[http://www.toronto.ca/health]) once lineups are closed, and advise people to check the website before heading to a clinic.</p>

<p>The campaign to vaccinate millions of Canadians against the H1N1 pandemic influenza virus presents an enormous logistical challenge. Public health officials have worked on immunization strategies for months.</p>
<p>In the past week, they have transformed health clinics, community centres and schools into mass vaccination sites, complete with mountains of alcohol wipes, gloves and needles.</p>
<p>Nurses are giving most of the vaccinations. Some have been redeployed from other roles in hospitals and others have been pulled from retirement to jab needles into arms. Volunteers have been mobilized to screen patients and hand out consent forms.</p>
<p>Security guards are on duty at many clinics, partly to direct traffic in clogged parking lots. Some have had to calm flared tempers after clinics started turning people away because of high volumes.</p>
<p>Officials are spreading news about where and when to get the shots via websites, posters and church bulletins. In the last week, many jurisdictions extended hours and added extra clinics.</p>
<p>Health professionals are also planning to fly into some remote northern aboriginal reserves to administer the vaccine.</p>

<p>Oshawa, Ont. -- Re Weeding Out The Queue (Oct. 31). The majority of survivors from the sinking of the Titanic were women and children, as chivalry guided who got into the limited number of lifeboats. Had that disaster occurred in 2009, the same lifeboats would be full of the strongest, healthiest, and most cowardly men who were able to elbow their way to the front of the line.</p>
<p>I know this from seeing the behaviour at H1N1 vaccination clinics. My pregnant, asthmatic wife was just one of many members of vulnerable groups who were forced to stand in line for several hours as healthy, non-high risk people inundated the clinics. Time for public health to take a harder stand and restrict access to the clinics to those who need it most.</p>

<p>Toronto -- Please, could we all get a grip? The hysterical coverage of long lineups of people who apparently fall into the high-risk category, waiting to get the H1N1 flu shot, and late-breaking reports of how many doses of the vaccine have been shipped to various jurisdictions, reminds me of the early 1960s.</p>
<p>Back then, constant media coverage of the Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis, and school drills to prepare children for an atomic bomb attack, terrorized children, who in the end came to no harm.</p>
<p>Think about the 10- to 13-year-olds who have just learned of the recent tragic deaths of two other young people in Ontario. They hear that they are not in the defined “high risk” group and so have no priority for the H1N1 vaccination. Could we adults try to put this situation in perspective and prevent yet another generation of pre teens taking cover under their figurative school desks?</p>

<p>Portugal Cove-St. Philip's, Nfld. -- We've been promised that we will all have the opportunity to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus by Christmas.</p>
<p>Perhaps the health officials and media who hyped the initial risk should now make a case for why we should still get the vaccination at that time.</p>
<p>By then I will either have caught it, or been exposed and not caught it. So why bother?</p>

<p>A lot of good zombie movies start like this: Hundreds of frustrated people line up for hours, waiting for inoculations against a mysterious virus. In the movies, you can skip to the next scene, but at the Toronto clinic I visited last week, the lineup was impossible so I turned around and went home.</p>
<p>I felt helpless and hopeless and overwhelmed trying to fight against something I know almost nothing about. This felt like nothing less than a fight for my family's lives, and my growing sense of panic about H1N1 was giving morbid birth to funeral fantasies.</p>
<p>These thoughts were relentless and depressing and tended to star my twin 10-month-old babies. My little loves. Henry and Melanie Rose. When I came back home from the vaccination clinic, Henry was napping. An hour or so later he woke up crying, and when I picked him up he was beet-red and burning up.</p>
<p>He's usually a sweet little guy, but this was full-on misery and sobbing. He had a hot head and a stuffy nose and the saddest mouth in the world. I took his temperature: 103.1 F. My son had gone from no fever at all to a serious fever while I was scoping out the flu shot lineup. I freaked out. Henry and I burst into the emergency department of Sick Kids Hospital 10 minutes later. I discovered that 10 minutes in the car is more than enough time to imagine every horrible thing you never wanted to think about, and to recall every headline and replay every news clip about what was surely a death sentence: swine flu. The emergency waiting room was a kaleidoscope of coughs and sneezes, masks and gloves. Signs posted everywhere informed patients that the H1N1 vaccine was NOT being administered here, and implied that they should quit asking.</p>
<p>I was trying to hold it together but by this time I was scared and I started to cry, taking my place in line behind all the other frightened parents who had arrived there first. We were seen almost immediately by the triage nurse, who assessed Henry's condition and breathing. She listened kindly while I whimpered out Henry's history and the reason we were there. After checking out his chest, she told me that his breathing was fine and it might be a while before we saw a doctor. A while turned out to be 5½ hours. We grabbed free masks, but Henry kept pulling his off so we moved from seat to seat, trying to avoid the obviously sick people.</p>
<p>Henry was a good little guy, but I was disorganized and upset and probably took up more than my share of emotional and physical space. Diapers and bottles spilled out of my purse, soothers fell on the floor, my BlackBerry went off every two minutes. Henry crawled all over me like he was climbing an ant hill. I left his OHIP card on a seat and had to ask people to shift their tired, sick kids while I looked everywhere for my own child's ticket to ride our health-care system. When we finally saw the doctor, she was young and smart and knew every trick in the book to keep my little guy happy. I liked her immediately. I listed his symptoms over the past couple of days – a sniffly nose and diarrhea that morning, ending with the sudden fever – and after she examined him she told me he most likely has swine flu. Swine flu. It just rolled off her tongue. She didn't even ask me to sit down first.</p>
<p>One part of me listened to her, and the other part of me couldn't believe what I was hearing. She said he wasn't in any immediate danger. He wasn't even going to be admitted. I shouldn't invest in biohazard suits, and this was not a predator stalking our children. It was a new strain of flu – and one that most people who have contracted have lived through.</p>
<p>The doctor said I should keep a close eye on him for any signs he is struggling to breathe, give him over-the-counter medication as needed and see his doctor if he didn't seem better in three or four days. And she said to expect his twin sister to come down with it as well.</p>
<p>This was everything I had feared, and not what I had expected at all. Every member of the staff we dealt with at Sick Kids were kind, knowledgeable and – this is the humbling part – understanding and patient with a terrified public that doesn't know what information to trust in the H1N1 crisis.</p>
<p>The irony was that I felt calmer after I found out Henry has swine flu than I ever did when I was frantically trying to find a way to protect my children from it. Talking to front-line health-care workers and accepting the nature of this illness helped a lot.</p>
<p>It isn't the little pigs you need to worry about, it's the Big Bad Wolf. I was starting to get it.</p>
<p>But I wouldn't be a new mom if I wasn't a committed worrier, so I'm watching Henry like a hawk. He's still sick, and we're fighting the fever, but his breathing is just fine. So far his twin sister has a low-grade fever but seems healthy.</p>
<p>We were discharged with a clear list of instructions that told us under what circumstances we should take him to see his own doctor, and under what circumstances we should get back to the hospital immediately. I'm not freaking out any more, but I'm not taking this lightly, either – my husband and I are staying home for a while. But we're going to turn off the news and watch Henry and Melanie Rose instead.</p>

<p>Grandma's favourites</p>
<p>“Grandmothers are programmed to prefer their son's daughters to their other grandchildren, according to scientists,” The Daily Telegraph reports. “The study, published in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B, found that a grandmother's love for her grandchildren is partially rooted in DNA. The Cambridge University scientists concluded that a grandmother shares most genes with her son's daughters – and the least with her son's sons. … A woman passes around 31 per cent of her genes to her son's daughters but just 23 per cent to her son's sons. Her daughter's children fall in the middle, with both sexes sharing around 25 per cent of their genes.”</p>
<p>We see what you see</p>
<p>“In the last few years, patterns in brain activity have been used to successfully predict what pictures people are looking at, their location in a virtual environment or a decision they are poised to make,” Ewen Callaway writes for New Scientist. “The most recent results show that researchers can now recreate moving images that volunteers are viewing – and even make educated guesses at which event they are remembering. Last [month] at the Society for Neuroscience meeting in Chicago, Jack Gallant, a leading ‘neural decoder' at the University of California, Berkeley, presented one of the field's most impressive results yet. He and colleague Shinji Nishimoto showed that they could create a crude reproduction of a movie clip that someone was watching just by viewing their brain activity. Others at the same meeting claimed that such neural decoding could be used to read memories and future plans – and even to diagnose eating disorders.”</p>
<p>Little church in the sky</p>
<p>“An English countryside church is proving to be a popular place for couples to marry – in Japan,” BBC News reports. “Developers have reproduced All Saints Church Brockhampton, near Ross-on-Wye in Herefordshire, on the 21st and 22nd floors of a tower block in Osaka. … The Grade-I listed church is one of the few with a thatched roof in England. Reverend Will Pridie said the developers had visited the church and took laser measurements to enable the new one to be built.” The replica is three-quarters the size of the original church.</p>
<p>Who's the lucky fellow?</p>
<p>“To you, that cute pink bra with black lace trim might conjure up thoughts of sexy lingerie. To Dr. Elena Bodnar, it represents a possible lifesaver,” Erika Slife reports in the Chicago Tribune. “Behold the bra-mask – a brassiere that in an emergency can be turned into a pair of protective face masks. Bodnar's invention won the Ig Nobel Prize … To use the bra-mask, the wearer unsnaps the brassiere from under her shirt, which breaks it in two.” The inventor envisions the garment being used during such disasters as fires, terrorist attacks, dust storms or a swine flu outbreak. “She hopes all women will eventually have one. But what about the men? As Bodnar noted in her Oct. 1 acceptance speech at Harvard University, ‘Isn't it wonderful that women have two breasts, not just one? We can save not only our own lives, but also a man of our choice next to us.' ”</p>
<p>Bad driver gene?</p>
<p>“Have you been guilty of more than one minor car accident involving an inanimate object? … Do your family members and acquaintances routinely refuse to let you operate their motor vehicles?” asks Elisabeth Best of Miller-McCune.com. “If you answered yes … you might be a bad driver. But a new study published recently in the journal Cerebral Cortex suggests that your genes may be to blame. People with a gene variant limiting the availability of a protein called brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) performed more than 20 per cent worse on a driving test than people without it. A follow-up test a few days later had similar results. BDNF works to keep memory strong by supporting brain cell communication. When you are engaged in a task like driving, BDNF is secreted in the area of the brain responsible for the function and helps your body respond. About 30 per cent of Americans have the genetic variant.”</p>
<p>Thought du jour</p>
<p>“In my experience, the worst thing you can do to an important problem is discuss it. You know – I really do think this whole business of non-communication is one of the more poignant fallacies of our zestfully overexplanatory age. Most of us understand as much as we need to without having to be told.” – English playwright Simon Gray in Otherwise Engaged (1975)</p>

<p>WHAT, ANOTHER HOAX? BLOGGER CRIES WOLF</p>
<p>It seems parenting hoaxes are the hot craze these days. On the heels of the Balloon Boy fiasco comes the tale of the mommy blogger who cried wolf. In an Oct 16 post titled “tsa agents took my son,” Nicole White recounted a harrowing case of injustice at the Atlanta Hartsfield-Jackson airport. On her blog My Bottle's Up, Ms. White said the U.S. Transportation Security Administration authorities searched her, then snatched her son when she wasn't looking. Part of the saga was bunk, parentdish.com reports, but it wasn't revealed until concern from readers came flooding in and the TSA released a video showing the not-at-all dramatic scene at the airport that day. In a blogged apology, Ms. White admitted the TSA didn't actually take her son away. But, she said, “bottom line: my son and i were mistreated and using my blog and my freedom of speech … .” Perhaps as a Heene-style publicity tool?</p>

<p>CRAIGSLIST CAPER SEX AD FOR 9-YEAR-OLD</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Craigslist</span> has long been a cesspool of twisted, sexed-up revenge plots. But the ick factor reached new heights last week when a Long Island, N.Y., woman stood accused of leading sex-seeking men to a nine-year-old girl on the classified site. The woman – a mother and a social worker, no less – allegedly posted an ad for sex, then gave the child's first name and phone number to respondents, wcbstv.com reports. Margery Tannenbaum is thought to have cooked up the revenge plot after her own daughter came home in tears following an argument with the nine-year-old. Court documents say the victim's mother received lurid calls from the sex seekers, one of whom purred “Oh, hot lady lives with foxy momma!” The caller hung up after mom revealed the hot lady's real age. Ms. Tannenbaum faces charges of aggravated harassment and endangering the welfare of a child. How will her daughter ever make friends again?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Don't let flu flourish in the gym; Always wipe down equipment, wash hands before and after workout</b>
</div><div>Jill Barker   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>918 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Exercise is a known immunity-booster, which is why Health Canada recommends regular workouts as part of its strategy to protect against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>But is the gym the best place to avoid the flu, or is the shared equipment and sweaty population prime breeding ground for a virus that experts say has reached pandemic status?</p>
<p>"You're more likely to get the flu from the guy on the treadmill next to you than from the treadmill itself," said Dalius Briedis, an infectious-disease specialist at the McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>H1N1 is predominantly transferred from individual to individual through aerosol droplets in the air -- which means being coughed on by someone beside you is the most likely way for the flu to be transmitted.</p>
<p>So, the first step in staying healthy is asking exercisers to avoid the gym when they are sick.</p>
<p>That being said, Briedis noted that it is possible for the virus to stay viable for a short period of time on a hard surface such as a piece of fitness equipment. Therefore, it's prudent to take extra precautions when using equipment that is passed from one exerciser to the next, such as cardio and weight training machines, exercise balls and dumbbells.</p>
<p>"If you come in contact with the virus and then touch your face, nose or eyes, it's possible to get the flu," said Briedis.</p>
<p>Wiping down equipment with a cleaning solution after use, draping a clean towel over an exercise mat or bench and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after a workout should be standard practice in gyms across the country.</p>
<p>But gym rats aren't the only exercisers who need to take special precautions when it comes to avoiding the flu.</p>
<p>According to Briedis, sport teams are also at increased risk of exposure to the H1N1 virus. The proximity of athletes to each other and to their personal belongings makes the virus easy to pass along from one teammate to the next.</p>
<p>And once the flu hits one team member, there's no telling how quickly it will spread and the kind of impact it can have on a team's ability to field enough players to compete.</p>
<p>A look back in history suggests that the flu can have devastating effects on a team.</p>
<p>"In the winter of 1918-19, the Stanley Cup playoffs were cancelled due to an outbreak of the Spanish flu," said Briedis. "Four members of the Canadiens team got sick and one died."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the H1N1 virus has been linked to a relatively small number of fatalities worldwide and, for the most part, results in a moderate fever, fatigue and aches and pains, which in a healthy population means spending a few days in bed recuperating.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean it can be treated lightly by teams and leagues across the country.</p>
<p>Simple precautions can reduce the risk. Water bottles and towels shouldn't be shared between athletes (all towels should be removed from team benches) and a protocol should be in place to keep sick athletes away from their healthy teammates.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends quarantining an athlete until they are symptom-free (no coughing or fever) for 24 hours. If an athlete gets sick on the road, they should be put in a private room and wear a mask during the bus ride home where they should sit as far away from their teammates as possible.</p>
<p>The same goes for the sick athlete's roommate, who should be kept under a watchful eye for three days before being placed back on the playing roster.</p>
<p>As for the ritual of shaking hands after a game, Briedis isn't in favour of suspending this age-old tradition. With physical contact a natural consequence of most team sports, there is little to be gained by forgoing shaking hands, especially if athletes wash their hands or use hand sanitizers immediately after the game.</p>
<p>The ritual Briedis is in favour of forgoing, however, is the Montreal two-cheek kiss, which he claims should be suspended until after the H1N1 virus runs its course.</p>
<p>If the flu does strike, the decision to exercise or compete is probably moot as fever and the associated aches and pains will relegate all but the hardiest to bed until the symptoms abate.</p>
<p>The average time to recuperate is three to seven days, after which exercisers are encouraged to get back in the game or gym slowly.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends waiting for 24 hours after the fever has abated before resuming light exercise. A body recuperating from flu is quick to fatigue, so respect the signals your body is sending and take it easy if you feel less than 100 per cent during your workout.</p>
<p>Precautions should also be taken before exercising in the cold, especially if your flu symptoms included a cough. Cold air can further irritate already inflamed bronchial pathways, causing a rebound case of bronchitis and another couple of days in bed.</p>
<p>Once you feel up to speed, go ahead and resume your normal workouts. Exercise is still the best medicine for a healthy mind and body.</p>

</div><div>Ben Kuzma   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>770 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final C</div><div>A38</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>GAME OVER</p>
<p>Vancouver Canucks 3 - Colorado Avalanche 0</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The plan was to get to Craig Anderson. Get in his kitchen. Rattle some pots and pans and rattle the NHL's hottest stopper on Sunday at GM Place.</p>
<p>The plan was to do this with a dozen forwards, but even that didn't play out as planned. The injury-ravaged Vancouver Canucks got one forward back from injury -- Kyle Wellwood from a broken toe -- and lost rookie winger Michael Grabner to a severe ankle injury in the hallway warmup before they took to the ice in a 3-0 victory over the Western Conference leading Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>The next thing you know, the Canucks will announce someone has contracted the H1N1 flu virus. It's been that kind of season, with six forwards and one star goalie still on the limp. Getting goals from Mason Raymond, Ryan Kesler and Tanner Glass was great Sunday, but losing Grabner hurts.</p>
<p>Maybe that's why coach Alain Vigneault didn't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>"He hurt himself warming up and will be out for quite some time -- it's undetermined," he said of Grabner's injury. "He flipped over on his ankle."</p>
<p>While the Canucks will likely recall rookie Sergei Shirokov from the Manitoba Moose, their options are limited.</p>
<p>"We can always look at options, but we're stretching it," admitted Vigneault. "We're talking to Ryan [assistant coach Walter] to see if he might think of making a comeback. I don't want that part though -- I've seen him skate lately."</p>
<p>So, with defenceman Aaron Rome again finding himself playing wing and the Canucks deciding to rest hard-shooting blueliner Mathieu Schneider, it was easy to expect the worst.</p>
<p>After all, Anderson was looking like a Vezina Trophy candidate in leading the league in wins (10), saves percentage (.939) and ranking second in shutouts (2) and third in goals-against average (2.04). But the Canucks got to him early and that set the tone to improve to 8-7-0 while the Avalanche dropped to 10-3-2.</p>
<p>"We made his job hard tonight," said Kesler, who banged home a rebound off a second-period Sami Salo point shot to give the Canucks a two-goal cushion. "He's human back there and we got to him early and often."</p>
<p>With all the focus on Anderson, it was backup goalie Andrew Raycroft who registered his first shutout of the season and seventh of his career with an 18-save performance. In relief of the injured Roberto Luongo, he looked much more poised than the guy who got yanked Friday in Anaheim after surrendering four goals on 18 shots during a 7-2 loss.</p>
<p>And the Canucks looked more determined to rebound after the Ducks loss, even though time and space were at a premium and only Steve Bernier could manage more than two of the 20 shots they registered.</p>
<p>"There wasn't a lot of room out there and we were able to beat the best player in the NHL in their goaltender," said Vigneault. "I thought our guys battled hard."</p>
<p>While the Canucks were outhit 13-4 in the first period and looked tentative, they got better as the game wore on and didn't lean on the injury crutch.</p>
<p>"Some teams might pack it in, saying we have too many injuries, and just play in out until these guys get back," said Kesler. "We basically win by outworking teams and that's what we did, and Razor [Raycroft] played great and really won a game for us tonight."</p>
<p>Added Raymond: "It says a lot about our depth."</p>
<p>It was Raymond's opening goal that proved pivotal because the Canucks knew what they had to do to get to Anderson.</p>
<p>When Alex Edler let a point shot fly, Raymond got into position in front of Anderson for a screen and was then able to roof a rebound over the keeper when he coughed up a rebound on the shot at 11:05.</p>
<p>"We knew we had to take away his line of sight," said Raymond.</p>
<p>In the third period, Glass got his first goal of the season and just his second career goal when his wrister from the side at 9:25 deflected in off the skate of defenceman Scott Hannan.</p>

<p>Diego Milito and Maicon each scored to give Inter Milan a 2-0 victory over Livorno in the Italian League on Sunday.</p>
<p>Since Serie A started awarding three points for wins in 1994-95, Inter Milan's seven-point lead is the largest ever after 11 rounds.</p>
<p>"This is the result of all the great work that the guys have done every day, although there is still a long way to go," said Inter coach Jose Mourinho.</p>
<p>Sampdoria drew 0-0 with promoted Bari, which missed a penalty shot in the 90th minute, and joined Juventus in second, each with 21 points.</p>
<p>Napoli beat Juventus 3-2 on Saturday and Milan defeated Parma 2-0.</p>
<p>ENGLAND</p>
<p>LONDON -- Manchester City goalkeeper Shay Given saved James McFadden's penalty shot in a scoreless draw at Birmingham, allowing his team to climb into fourth in the Premier League.</p>
<p>Man City's fourth draw in a row -- but first 0-0 score in 55 games -- gave Mark Hughes' team 19 points with only one loss, the fewest defeats of any team.</p>
<p>The club is still eight points behind leader Chelsea and six back from defending champion Manchester United.</p>
<p>SCOTLAND</p>
<p>GLASGOW -- Heavy rain forced the referee to call off Rangers' match at Dundee United at half time. Rangers led 1-0 at Tannadice Park after Steven Davis' 29th-minute goal. The game will be replayed at a future date.</p>
<p>GERMANY</p>
<p>FRANKFURT -- A goal by Brazilian striker Maicosuel earned Hoffenheim a 1-0 victory over Freiburg that moved the club into fifth place in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>Hoffenheim is three points behind leader Bayer Leverkusen, which squandered a two-goal lead in a 2-2 draw Saturday with Schalke.</p>
<p>FRANCE</p>
<p>PARIS -- Paris St Germain grabbed their first Ligue 1 win in two months when they thrashed hosts Sochaux 4-1 on Sunday.</p>
<p>The side from the capital, who did not play last weekend because three of their players were diagnosed with the H1N1 Virus, climbed to 10th in the standings.</p>
<p>PSG, who had not won in the league since Aug. 30, are nine points behind leaders Girondins Bordeaux, 1-0 winners over Monaco on Saturday.</p>
<p>SPAIN</p>
<p>MADRID -- Villarreal romped to a 5-0 home victory over promoted Tenerife, continuing their revival after a poor start to the La Liga campaign.</p>

</p>
<p>They lived in Canada's small towns and big cities, from coast to coast. They were children, parents, friends and neighbours. Some had health problems before the virus struck them down, but many were young and vital.</p>
<p>Scientists are still trying to determine why H1N1 affects some people and not others, and why it hits some more severely. But for those who knew and loved those who have died with H1N1, the loss has been heartbreaking.</p>
<p>So far, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada, the virus formerly known as 'swine flu' has killed 95 Canadians. Their names are not released by government for privacy reasons, but the identities of some have emerged over the months.</p>
<p>Here are the stories of 10 Canadians who have died from H1N1.</p>
<p>Ashley Miller, 26, from Mission, B.C., died Oct. 11 after coming down with H1N1 and spending two days in hospital in Abbotsford. The mother of a one-year-old daughter named Emma, Miller was otherwise healthy before getting sick. She was the eighth person to die of H1N1 in B.C., but the first person in the province to die who had no underlying health issues.</p>
<p>Vanessa Bluebell, a 25-year-old mother of four with no previous medical issues, was the first Calgary-area casualty of H1N1. She grew up in the Yellow Quill First Nation in Saskatchewan, where she likely contracted the virus at a funeral for her cousin. Bluebell was hospitalized June 27, but sent home, only to return two days later when her symptoms worsened. She fell into a coma and died on July 9.</p>
<p>Tina L'Hirondelle was the first confirmed death from H1N1 in Canada. The 39-year-old had a history of asthma and diabetes and died in hospital in High Prairie, Alta., on April 28, after saying she was having difficulty breathing. She lived in the Metis settlement of Gift Lake and may have contracted the virus from her mother, who had a mild case of H1N1.</p>
<p>Hannah Arsenault Dicks, known as "Hannah-Banana," a six-year-old from La Ronge, Sask., died in July after contracting H1N1 while in hospital for a bone condition. Dicks had many health problems, had been tube-fed since birth and was unable to walk or talk. Dicks' father, Paul, has started a sanitizing campaign at the hotel where he works as a general manager to help prevent the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>Perry Chernesky, a Baptist minister at the Oakbank Baptist Church in Winnipeg, died on July 5. The healthy, friendly 43-year-old was put in isolation at a Winnipeg hospital. His kidneys failed and he eventually died of a heart attack. Originally from Edmonton, Chernesky left behind a wife and two daughters</p>
<p>Lorraine Wilson, 45, died of complications from the H1N1 virus in June. She lived in Northern Manitoba in the Opaskwayak Cree Nation and worked at a school library. Initially, she was sent home by doctors who said she had a cold. She was eventually diagnosed with pneumonia as well as H1N1. Wilson had a daughter and was raising two of her nieces when she died.</p>
<p>Karin Shiozaki died in Kingston General Hospital on Oct. 19 after complaining of shortness of breath, coughing and discomfort. The 52-year-old woman from Newboro, Ont., had a history of asthma and was overweight. She worked as a respiratory technologist and left behind her husband of 33 years, Ian Kent Shiozaki, and two grown children, Alix and Jesse.</p>
<p>Vanetia Warner, 10, died a few days after showing symptoms, at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario on Oct. 24. Vanetia, a Grade 5 student at St. Anne's Catholic School in Cornwall, was a healthy child whose death sparked a wave of concern among parents. She was a figure-skater who loved the music of Miley Cyrus.</p>
<p>Rubjit Thindal, 6, from Brampton, Ont., died from the virus on June 15. Her symptoms included joint pain, fever, and later, a persistent stomach ache. On the way to the hospital, the Grade 1 student at Roberta Bondar School went limp. Her father tried to revive her with CPR; she died two hours later.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio, 13, was a minor-league hockey player with the Mississauga North Stars who attended Hill Academy in Vaughan, Ont. On Oct. 24, during a hockey tournament in London, Ont., he developed a sore throat and fever. Two days later, he collapsed on his bathroom floor and was pronounced dead at St. Joseph's Health Centre on Oct. 26. Friends remember Evan as a great friend and talented hockey player.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Huge vaccine shortfall looms; Second wave 'breaking out pretty rapidly across the country,' says Prairie specialist</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>637 words</div><div>2 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>As the nation faces the threat this week of a dramatic vaccine shortfall, federal government data released to Canwest News Service shows the provinces and territories have used slightly more than one million doses of swine-flu drugs from the national antiviral stockpile, to fight H1N1.</p>
<p>It is a sign of how many people may already have been sickened with the virus, as the second wave of infection spreads across the country.</p>
<p>Today is Day 8 of the most ambitious immunization program in Canada's history, and the beginning of a week that is likely to see more long lineups for unexpectedly scarce shots, more stress on emergency rooms and intensive-care units, and more health-care workers and schoolchildren falling sick.</p>
<p>In the greater Toronto area, a call has been put out to family doctors to help triage and assess patients with flu symptoms in emergency rooms struggling to cope with a sharp surge in demand.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, public health officials are preparing to set up a network of flu clinics across the city to divert people away from crowded emergency rooms entirely.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, critical-care doctors in Winnipeg and other cities are watching anxiously as the number of patients with severe H1N1 infections admitted to intensive care grows.</p>
<p>As cities struggle to cope with a vaccine shortfall that could stretch to several weeks, delaying shots to all but the most vulnerable, Canada's chief public health officer is urging patience. Dr. David Butler-Jones says the government remains on target to have every Canadian who wishes to be vaccinated immunized by Christmas.</p>
<p>Some worry that, by then, much of the wave will be over.</p>
<p>"The epidemic is breaking out pretty rapidly across the country, I think that's pretty obvious," says Dr. Anand Kumar, who specializes in the care of critically ill patients with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and who is an associate professor of critical care and infectious disease at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>"You can't block it now. We're too late to block it. The only way that you're going to blunt it is to get as many people vaccinated as fast as you can," Kumar says.</p>
<p>"I think what's going to happen over the course of the next week, two weeks, is going to be substantially independent of the vaccine," he says. "The numbers will just continue to increase," he says. "The number of suspected H1N1 ICU cases is increasing really rapidly.</p>
<p>"It's on the move."</p>
<p>Family doctors are seeing increased volumes of patients with influenza-like symptoms, says Dr. Sarah Kredentser, president of the College of Family Physicians of Canada. They are working longer hours and making more slots available for acutely sick patients by limiting routine visits, she says.</p>
<p>According to latest surveillance data from the Public Health Agency of Canada, the country is experiencing "striking" increases in flu activity across the country, particularly in the West, and in Newfoundland, which on Sunday said it had experienced its first H1N1-related death: a 36-year-old woman who had a pre-existing medical condition.</p>
<p>Overall, 175 hospitalizations and nine deaths were reported in the week ending Oct. 24.</p>
<p>The number of reported new hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths was about three times higher than for the previous week.</p>
<p>As of Oct. 24, a total of 1,779 hospitalized cases, including 351 cases admitted to an intensive-care unit, and 185 cases requiring ventilation, had been reported since the outbreak began.</p>

</p>
<p>It's minutes before 10 a.m., and Alphonse Denechezhe has just finished his morning spit into a plastic cup.</p>
<p>He puts it next to the others on a wooden shelf in the living room, near where his young son and daughter are sleeping on mattresses. Denechezhe, 42, will take the samples to the nurse, but it could be weeks before anyone knows whether his recent coughing fits and night sweats are what he fears.</p>
<p>Denechezhe calls it "the sickness," the disease that just won't go away.</p>
<p>He's watched tuberculosis devastate his family and plague his community for years.</p>
<p>Northlands First Nation in Lac Brochet, one of Manitoba's most remote communities, has earned a dubious distinction as a global TB hot spot. It and another Manitoba community health officials will not name recorded the highest rates of TB in the world for two decades. Until 2004, Lac Brochet remained one of the world's worst-affected communities.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Denechezhe watched his ex-wife nearly die of TB of the brain in a Winnipeg hospital isolation room. He and all 18 people who lived in the same three-bedroom house tested positive for TB, too. He was supposed to wear a mask and take medication for nine months to cure his "sleeping TB."</p>
<p>But Denechezhe doesn't trust medication, not even Tylenol. He stopped taking the TB pills when he couldn't handle the intense side effects of nausea and fatigue. He failed to finish his medication again two years ago, after a nurse warned him the disease could strike at any time.</p>
<p>Now, he's been coughing for weeks and worries he's already infected his young son who started coughing days go.</p>
<p>"Maybe it'll kill me. I don't know," said Denechezhe. "But this sickness seems to be carrying on. We get rid of it for a little while, but it seems to pop up left and right."</p>
<p>It's been more than three decades since the last sanatorium in Manitoba shut its doors and tuberculosis faded in the minds of most of the public.</p>
<p>But TB never went away. It is still rampant in First Nations communities in northern Manitoba. It's a medical illness propagated by non-medical factors, tangled in a historical and political web that has long neglected the poverty that helps TB survive.</p>
<p>TB is a barometer for overall health: where there is poverty and suffering, there is TB. Plain and simple, it is a symptom of poverty, a byproduct of overcrowded homes, malnutrition and poor overall health.</p>
<p>That same deadly mix let H1N1 flourish in the north this summer and made TB a scourge on Manitoba reserves for a century.</p>
<p>Medical experts warned for years that a major problem would arise in the North if TB outbreaks and the living conditions that contribute to them were not addressed. The warning went unheeded, and the disease exploded in places such as Lac Brochet five years ago. Now, Manitoba has one of the highest TB rates in the country.</p>
<p>In northern Manitoba, living conditions on some reserves are often described as Third World -- many houses are decrepit, some don't have toilets or running water, and multiple families are crammed under one roof. Inadequate hygiene, rotting walls and close quarters make reserves ripe for the spread of an airborne disease. When one person gets sick, everybody gets sick.</p>
<p>In 1937, TB officials noted that overcrowded homes and poor living conditions on reserves contributed to the high rate of disease among First Nations. In 2009, as many as 18 people are crammed into three-bedroom houses at Lac Brochet.</p>
<p>The community recorded some of the highest TB rates in the world -- more than 600 cases per 100,000, more than 100 times what it should be. By comparison, the national rate in Canada is five cases per 100,000. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, the rate is slightly below 400 cases per 100,000.</p>
<p>Last year, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs petitioned Canada's auditor general to investigate what federal health officials are doing to control the rising rates of infectious diseases such as TB on reserves. Grand Chief Ron Evans hasn't heard back. He has no idea how many cases of TB surface on reserves because federal and provincial health officials refuse to divulge that information, citing privacy reasons. Evans said they can't solve the problem until they have all the facts.</p>
<p>"My suspicions are if they provide that information, it will be so alarming they would have to put resources toward the root causes, which is of course overcrowding, issues of poverty, the lack of proper running water and sewage," he said.</p>
<p>Manitoba officials refused to disclose the number of cases on reserves, saying to do so would "harm relations" with the federal government.</p>
<p>"It's an excuse they're using to cover up inadequacies," said Dr. Earl Hershfield, former director of the province's TB control program.</p>
<p>Lac Brochet's Dene community lives in one of the most remote places in Manitoba -- the northwestern corner of the province. A group of families broke away from Brochet to settle in Lac Brochet in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Northlands First Nation was to be a remote haven where the Dene could hunt caribou, fish and live off the land. The isolation was supposed to preserve their traditional ways of life. Instead, it exacerbated a flurry of health and social problems in recent years.</p>
<p>Few people have jobs, and there's no way off the reserve except to fly out for a medical appointment or brave the 13-hour, white-knuckle ride on the winter road to Thompson, Man.</p>
<p>Denechezhe said people are cooped up in cramped quarters during the long winter, an invitation for TB to spread.</p>
<p>"It's just frustrating sometimes to even talk about it, and the more you talk about it the angrier you get," he said.</p>
<p>In 2001, Indian and Northern Affairs estimated there was a shortfall of 8,500 houses on northern reserves such as Denechezhe's and close to half of existing homes required renovations. Since then, the shortage has worsened, largely due to limited construction and a birthrate twice the Canadian average.</p>
<p>The reserve baby boom has left many young families homeless. In Lac Brochet, close to 1,000 residents live in 135 houses. People such as Denechezhe are among the hidden homeless who crowd into relatives' homes because they have nowhere else to stay.</p>
<p>He and two of his children live in his mother's two-bedroom house with five other family members. The grey house looks nearly identical to the other dozen sandwiched close together in "central" Lac Brochet on a slope near the lake. The two bedrooms and one bathroom are the only divided rooms in the house, and there is little room left for people and furniture in the small space.</p>
<p>"I'm 42 years old, and I'm still living with my mom. It's not supposed to be like that," said Denechezhe, who works in the band office.</p>
<p>Half of Lac Brochet houses were included in a recent study and nearly half of those housed at least one person who had contracted TB. Most of the houses are overcrowded, with an average of eight people per household -- four times the Canadian average.</p>
<p>"Size matters," said Linda Larcombe, an anthropologist and disease researcher with the University of Manitoba who studies the spread of diseases in First Nations.</p>
<p>"It makes sense that (in) a smaller home with more people in it, your risk of contracting airborne and aerosolized disease is going to increase."</p>
<p>More than half the houses studied had visible mould. Medical experts say it takes a strong immune response to ward off TB germs, so an individual whose immune system is busy battling the effects of mould may not be able to fight off TB as well.</p>
<p>According to a 2003 auditor general report, many on-reserve houses have mould problems due to improper maintenance, poor ventilation and construction and overcrowding. Some Lac Brochet houses have so much mould they are literally decaying from the inside.</p>
<p>Indian Affairs did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, but sent an e-mail statement saying it will spend about $75 million to improve on-reserve housing in the next two years, part of the economic stimulus package.</p>
<p>Northlands First Nation Chief Joe Dantouze said the problem hasn't been solved and the community doesn't have enough money to build new houses or repair others also rotten with mould. That draws criticism from some residents who claim houses are allotted based entirely on a social pecking order.</p>
<p>In Lac Brochet, residents refer to the area where the chief and a lucky few live as Beverly Hills, a row of bi-level houses atop a ridge overlooking the centre of town. Everywhere else, families crowd into small houses with two or three bedrooms and no basements.</p>
<p>Martin St. Pierre shines a flashlight in the crawl space under Stephen Tssessaze's house to illuminate a black wall so corroded by mould it's soft to the touch. The beam of light uncovers a patch of long, white mushrooms growing from a crack in the foundation. Thin strips of last year's withered, slimy mushrooms appear to drip down the putrid wall.</p>
<p>St. Pierre does plumbing work for the band in Lac Brochet. He said he sees too many houses that should be condemned -- including others just like this one on the west side of town. Here, St. Pierre said, houses are in a low-lying area where spring run-off drains into the crawl space where moisture gets trapped.</p>
<p>The gag-inducing sight of patches of fungi and pervasive rot is overwhelming, even for St. Pierre.</p>
<p>"When I come through a house like this and there's kids in there, you feel bad, you know?" St. Pierre said.</p>
<p>Tssessaze lives with his two young boys and his girlfriend. The pungent stench of damp decay is unmistakable. It fills your nostrils when you walk through the front door. Tssessaze said his kids get sick a lot and he often has trouble breathing. He peers at the white fungi in the underbelly of his house, before a solemn look envelops his face.</p>
<p>"It's too much, right?"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>FLU Facts</b>
</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>

<p>Here's some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you'll be able to find much more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza which is different than the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions and pregnant women may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus - also known as human swine influenza - is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>How is it spread?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches their mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>CONTAGIOUSNESS</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>PREVENTION</p>
<p>- Wash hands often</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of your hand</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health care provider.</p>
<p>TREATMENT</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>VACCINATION</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

</p>
<p>"Let's talk," I said on Sunday.</p>
<p>She looked at me wide-eyed, startled.</p>
<p>"Really," I said. "You say we don't talk enough, so let's go. I have prepared a list of topics: A) the H1N1 vaccine, pro or con? B) Canucks secondary scoring, and C) old girlfriends and how much fun they were.</p>
<p>"It's 4 a.m.," she croaked.</p>
<p>"Actually, it's 3 a.m.," I replied. "Clocks changed last night. Spring forward, fall back and all that."</p>
<p>She must have had a charley horse at this point, because she screamed like that woman on So You Think You Can Dance. So I grabbed a pillow and headed for the couch.</p>
<p>Not that I could sleep. Time change, slime change. For some people, the end of Daylight time is a chance to lie in bed. For the rest of us, it just means waiting another hour for the world to wake up.</p>
<p>Be glad you live in Saskatchewan, the last sane province in Confederation.</p>
<p>I am, in fact, writing this at 5 a.m. Do you know what's on television at 5 a.m.? Infomercials. Lots and lots of infomercials: Jeff Paul's Shortcut to Millions, the Original Magic Bullet, the G2 Swivel Sweeper and something called Dollars4Gold, which promises relief for those with unwanted precious metals cluttering up their jewelry boxes/sock drawers/dental fillings.</p>
<p>A few TV preachers still have their hands out, though not as many as before. Maybe viewers have finally taken heed of Bono: "My God isn't short of cash."</p>
<p>No chat-line ads, either -- 5 a.m. must be too late for the lonely 1-900 hotties, the magnificent specimens of manhood whom they are just aching to meet having passed out into their ninth beer/PlayStations by then.</p>
<p>You know what's on the tube instead? Fitness commercials: P90X, Yoga Flex, AbCircle. Whatever happened to Bowflex, Tae Bo, ThighMaster and Sweating To The Oldies? No matter, the new ones still make you feel like a sack of mashed potatoes, sprawled on the couch. A tired, sleepless sack of mashed potatoes.</p>
<p>According to the National Sleep Foundation, a leading authority on sleep disorders, or at least one with a website that pops up on <span class="companylink">Google</span>, polls show that more than half of all American adults display symptoms of insomnia at least a few nights a week -- waking up unrefreshed, waking up too early, waking often during the night or not being able to fall asleep. (I also stumbled across a site that claimed most of the people who die in their sleep between 4 a.m. and 6 a.m. perish of sleep apnea. Great. Don't know if that's true, but now not only can I not fall back to sleep, but I'm afraid to do so.)</p>
<p>I have tried the classic methods of trying to find my way back to Dreamland -- warm milk, counting sheep, listening to Ignatieff.</p>
<p>The sheep thing worked until the farmer showed up, demanded to know what I was doing in his pasture, so I went back to the house and tried counting imaginary ones instead. I was up to 586 before I realized they were messing with my head, going out one ear, looping around, then going back in the other, just to make it look like there were more of them than there really were, like circus clowns in a little car.</p>
<p>Certain family members have pointed out that I don't really suffer from insomnia (a Latin word meaning "if you don't shut that light off I will stick it where it doesn't shine"), that in fact I get plenty of sleep after supper, nodding off on the aforementioned couch with my mouth open -- an attractively placed string of drool making me look just like Colin Firth, only different -- before lurching Lazarus-like back to life just in time to disrupt the conclusion of So You Think You Can Dance, as though anyone could sleep though that woman's shrieking anyway.</p>
<p>While there may be just a smidgen of truth to this assertion, it still doesn't change the fact that our bodies don't automatically change when the clocks do. Some get an extra hour of sleep. Others just get an extra hour awake.</p>

<p>With no end in sight for a nationwide shortage of the H1N1 flu vaccine, local health authorities said they will continue to restrict public access to previously scheduled swine flu clinics.</p>
<p>"That's unlikely to change in the foreseeable future -- the (amount of available) vaccine has been significantly reduced," said Windsor-Essex medical officer of health Dr. Allen Heimann.</p>
<p>Ontario will only be getting 170,000 doses of the vaccine this coming week, a big reduction from the 785,000 doses received last week."We will remain focused on high-risk until otherwise noted," said Heimann.</p>
<p>That means priority will be given to pregnant women, children between six months and five years old and people under 65 with pre-existing medical conditions at today's clinic in Leamington (Half Century Club, 1 to 7 p.m.).</p>
<p>The same restrictions will apply in Windsor Tuesday (Place Concorde 2 to 8 p.m.) and Wednesday (St. Clair College, 2 to 8 p.m.).</p>
<p>The chaotic scenes at earlier swine flu clinics hosted by the Windsor-Essex Health Unit weren't repeated Saturday at the Novelletto Rosati complex in West Windsor. Two uniformed Windsor police officers made sure of that, but the health unit's Deb Bennett said the public appears more accepting that, given the early shortages of available vaccine doses, priority must be given to groups at higher risk.</p>
<p>"People have a better understanding -- it's much calmer today," said Bennett, the health unit's director of health protection, who says she was physically assaulted during a clinic last week.</p>
<p>Before the serious business of trick or treating, it was safety first on Saturday morning for Natalina, a cuddly brown bear, and Angelina, decked out head-to-foot in red Formula 1 Ferrari wear. Both were on their way to a Halloween party but were first diverted by their mother to the H1N1 clinic at Novelletto Rosati for flu shots.</p>
<p>"I just want them to be OK," said mother Silvana Nawalany.</p>
<p>It was the Windsor woman's second attempt to get her children -- Natalina, 6 months, and Angelina, 2 -- immunized after the family was turned away Thursday from an overcrowded flu clinic.</p>
<p>Happy that her children were getting swine flu protection, Nawalany said she's quite comfortable waiting for all the priority cases to be accommodated before returning for her own flu shot.</p>
<p>Windsor's Alycia and Bryan Tomalty also brought their children Hugh, 21/2 years old, and Dermot, nine months, to Saturday's clinic.</p>
<p>Alycia said they'd discussed having the kids "build up their own immunity," but decided on the flu shots over concerns after seeing media reports of child deaths related to contracting the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>While the overall number of cases is going up, Heimann said cases of serious complications are still very rare.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as the nation faces the twin threat this week of a dramatic vaccine shortfall and "striking" increases in flu activity, federal government data released to Canwest News Service show the provinces and territories have used just over one million doses of swine flu drugs from the national antiviral stockpile to fight H1N1.</p>

<p>When it came down to it, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats had lost their chance to clinch a playoff spot. There was no hope of locking up home field, either, which means the greatest victory they could claim would be avoiding the flu dripping from the pores of their struggling opponents.</p>
<p>And the Ticats finally seem to have recaptured some of their early-season Canadian Football League momentum, taking advantage of a sloppy performance by the Saskatchewan Roughriders to emerge with a 24-6 win at Ivor Wynne Stadium yesterday.</p>
<p>Hamilton running-back DeAndra' Cobb finished with 25 carries for 160 yards and a touchdown. It was the third straight game in which the Ticats did not allow a sack.</p>
<p>It is believed the flu - reportedly not H1N1 - kept about a half-dozen players from practice through the week, and it showed on the field. Roughriders quarterback Darian Durant fumbled twice and was intercepted once in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Stampeders 28, Lions 26</p>
<p>At Vancouver, we already knew that the West Division title, and the right to host the Nov. 22 West Division final, won't be decided until next Saturday in Regina when the Stamps close out their regular-season schedule against the Saskatchewan Roughriders. But the Stamps' gutsy 28-26 win over the Lions, thanks to an 27-yard Sandro DeAngelis field goal at the final gun, certainly gave them a mental edge heading into Regina.</p>
<p>The Stamps improved to 10-6-1 and clinched a top-two finish in the West, meaning there will be a playoff game at McMahon Stadium later this month - date to be decided. The Lions, meanwhile, dropped to 8-9.</p>
<p>DeAngelis kicked the winner - twice, because the first was nullified by a penalty - after the Lions had taken a one-point lead with 1:35 left in the game.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic strains public health services; Redeployment of resources to cope with H1N1 comes at cost of other programs</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>660 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>An already underfunded and over-extended public health system needs major reinforcement so it has the same kind of "surge capacity" that is built into hospital settings, according to the Canadian Public Health Association.</p>
<p>The system is coping as best it can with the H1N1 pandemic, but the redeployment of staff and resources to deal with it comes at the cost of other public health activities, the chairman of the association said in an interview.</p>
<p>It shouldn't be that way, Dr. Cordell Neudorf said.</p>
<p>"Without investing in that surge capacity, what you end up with is a workforce that is under-resourced even between crises, and then during crises, having all that prevention and promotion activity completely stopping," he said.</p>
<p>Surge capacity refers to the ability to respond to a sudden increase in demand for services. The term is often heard in the context of hospital care.</p>
<p>While hospitals, doctor's offices and other primary-care facilities are certainly on the front lines of a pandemic, the burden likely falls heaviest on the public health sector of the health-care system.</p>
<p>For the past week, public health professionals jabbed needles into arms as fast as they could, answered queries from a worried public and were on the receiving end of the frustration of people who waited hours in line to see them.</p>
<p>This is what they have been preparing for since April, when the novel human H1N1 influenza virus first appeared and quickly swept the globe.</p>
<p>The public health community has been working non-stop since then, across the whole spectrum of pandemic planning. Their duties are numerous - detecting and monitoring the spread of the disease and managing the supply of resources are among them - but the biggest task of all is delivering the most extensive immunization program in Canada's history.</p>
<p>"I don't think people really appreciate that public health hasn't had to immunize this volume of people for decades," said Neudorf, who is also Saskatoon's chief medical officer.</p>
<p>With public health workers across the country largely deployed to the H1N1 campaign, some of their usual activities have been postponed or cancelled.</p>
<p>Those activities can include home visits with new mothers, breastfeeding-support programs, sexually transmitted disease clinics, school visits and delivering other immunization programs.</p>
<p>Which programs are sacrificed varies from one jurisdiction to another, said Neudorf, and the impact of putting them off should not be underestimated because there are health risks to doing so.</p>
<p>Reduced services could mean, for example, that a child doesn't get a shot that they should or misses a screening clinic where a health problem could get caught.</p>
<p>The system's inability to stretch very far was highlighted during the SARS health emergency in 2003 and the public health community is trying to draw attention to the lack of surge capacity, Neudorf said.</p>

<p>Shortage shuts flu clinics in Alberta</p>
<p>All flu clinics in Alberta will be shut down until further notice because of a shortage of vaccines, officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>Targeted H1N1 vaccinations will resume this week, but only for those most at risk, Alberta health officials said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Fears about low supply have sparked concerns about queue jumpers trying to get the vaccine before Canadians who have been deemed a high risk to contract H1N1.</p>
<p>Quebec, Ontario, Nova Scotia and Saskatchewan have said plans to open clinics to the general public this week have been put on hold so shots can be administered first to at-risk residents.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No shortage of vaccine, Bolduc says; Blitz to be completed in 8 weeks. Respect priority list with patience and discipline, minister urges</b>
</div><div>IRWIN BLOCK    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>659 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>There will be no shortage of H1N1 vaccine for every Quebecer who wants it, but those most at risk are first in line, says Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc.</p>
<p>"There will be vaccine for everybody," Bolduc told reporters at a news briefing in Quebec City yesterday.</p>
<p>Provincial health authorities said enough vaccine will be shipped here over the next few weeks to respond to the vaccination demand. They expect the vaccination blitz will be completed in eight weeks.</p>
<p>Bolduc reminded Quebecers that health professionals believe the vaccine is "the best way to protect yourself and those close to you."</p>
<p>Those with chronic diseases, especially pulmonary, and cardiac diseases and diabetes, plus pregnant women and children between 6 months and 5 years, will be vaccinated first, followed on Dec. 7 by adults and children over 5.</p>
<p>For pregnant women, the province is expecting a batch of vaccine in the next few days that does not contain adjuvant, for those who prefer that option.</p>
<p>Adjuvants are sometimes added to vaccines to promote a heightened immune response in the body.</p>
<p>Pregnant women in Canada were initially told they should wait for a non-adjuvanted version of the vaccine because the adjuvanted version had never been tested on pregnant women.</p>
<p>But last month, the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Canada said all evidence suggests there has been no significant safety concerns regarding the use of the adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>It issued a statement saying "these adjuvants have been used in other vaccines for decades. Countries around the world are stating that both types of H1N1 vaccine are safe, even for pregnant women."</p>
<p>Bolduc appealed for "patience and discipline" in respecting the priority accorded to those with greatest risk.</p>
<p>On Friday, in St. Eustache northwest of Montreal, some 1,000 people began lining up before dawn at a vaccination clinic, ahead of a scheduled 12:30 p.m. opening, hoping to jump the government's priority system.</p>
<p>A similar lineup of parents with kids was reported at a Sherbrooke clinic yesterday.</p>
<p>Those seeking a vaccination are asked to bring an ID card, such as the Quebec medicare card, and to stay in their local health-care region.</p>
<p>People who were turned away in one region because they are not among the priority group were asked not to try to get vaccinated by going to another region.</p>
<p>Dr. Yolaine Galarneau, director of the Quebec Health Department's front-line services, told the news conference that 90 to 95 per cent of people diagnosed with H1N1 do not have to see a doctor and can recover easily at home by following the government's guide for treatment, sent to most households in recent weeks.</p>

<p>When it came down to it, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats had lost their chance to clinch a playoff spot. There was no hope of locking up home field, either, which means the greatest victory they could claim would be avoiding the flu dripping from the pores of their struggling opponents.</p>
<p>And the Ticats finally seem to have recaptured some of their early-season Canadian Football League momentum, taking advantage of a sloppy performance by the Saskatchewan Roughriders to emerge with a 24-6 win at Ivor Wynne Stadium yesterday.</p>
<p>Hamilton running-back DeAndra' Cobb finished with 25 carries for 160 yards and a touchdown. It was the third straight game in which the Ticats did not allow a sack.</p>
<p>It is believed the flu - reportedly not H1N1 - kept about a half-dozen players from practice through the week, and it showed on the field. Roughriders quarterback Darian Durant fumbled twice and was intercepted once in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Ticats quarterback Kevin Glenn gave the home team a 10-0 lead in the first quarter when he found slotback Arland Bruce on a 12-yard touchdown pass.</p>
<p>Glenn marched the team to another touchdown in the second quarter, a drive capped with a 23-yard scoring run by Cobb. It gave the Ticats an 18-0 lead, and pushed the running back above 1,000 rushing yards this season, becoming the team's first 1,000-yard rusher since 2004, the last year the team made the playoffs.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan was powerless to respond. Durant had only completed eight of his 20 pass attempts heading into the fourth quarter, managing only 66 yards through the air, when he was replaced with Steven Jyles.</p>
<p>Hamilton plays in Winnipeg next week to decide which city will host the East Division semifinal.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Losing faith in cancer screening</b>
</div><div>Julie Mason   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1074 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>(From The Ottawa Citizen, November 3, 2009) A column on page A6 Sunday contained an incorrect quote from a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which resulted in the column containing incorrect information about cancer rates for men and women. In 1980, a white man's lifetime risk of prostate cancer was 1 in 11 (not 1 in 116); today, it is 1 in 6 (not 1 in 6.1). A woman's lifetime risk of breast cancer was 1 in 12 in 1980; today it is 1 in 8 (not 1 in 8.1). ***** </p>
<p>Despite the long lineups at flu shot clinics, there are still an astonishing number of Canadians who say they aren't planning to get the H1N1 vaccine, including the usual suspects: the vaccine conspiracy theorists who think it's all a money grab by Big Pharma; the health purists who won't put anything in their bodies but reverse osmosis water and mung beans; and the thrill seekers who smoke, drive without seatbelts and bungee jump from high places.</p>
<p>There are also alarming numbers of concerned and caring folks, particularly moms and dads, who want to do the right thing, but worry about the lack of testing and the use of a vaccine with an immune booster (adjuvant). Their concern reflects one of the most serious casualties of the whole pandemic situation -- the loss of faith in our public health officials.</p>
<p>That lack of confidence in previously trusted health sources got another jolt with the recent comments on cancer screening by the chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society, Dr. Otis Brawley.</p>
<p>"American medicine has overpromised when it comes to screening," Dr. Brawley told the New York Times. "The advantages to screening have been exaggerated."</p>
<p>Dr. Brawley was referring to widespread screening for breast and prostate cancer, the two most common cancers. The Canadian Cancer Society expects 22,700 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in 2009, and 5,400 will die. Men can expect 22,500 diagnoses of prostate cancer and 9,400 deaths.</p>
<p>Screening for these diseases used to consist of breast self-exams and mammograms for women, and the dreaded DRE (digital rectal exam) and the PSA blood test for prostate specific antigen, which can be a marker for prostate cancer. Today, regular breast self-exam has largely been dropped as a recommendation, and most health organizations don't advise widespread PSA screening.</p>
<p>As a population, we've been getting our mammograms and PSA tests for almost 25 years, but the benefits are less than clear. In a recent article in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA), researchers reported, "Overall cancer rates are higher, many more patients are being treated, and the absolute incidence of aggressive or later-stage disease has not been significantly decreased. Screening has had some effect, but it comes at significant cost, including overdiagnosis, overtreatment, and complications of therapy."</p>
<p>In the simplest terms, screening means that many more cancers are being diagnosed earlier and treated, but there has been no matching drop in deaths from advanced stages of these diseases. There are some differences between the results for breast cancer screening and prostate cancer screening -- mammograms have reduced the death rate for breast cancer by up to 20 per cent; the death rate for prostate cancer is basically unchanged. The study in JAMA pointed out the significant increase in the number of cancers detected in the United States. "Prostate-specific antigen testing has nearly doubled the chance that a man will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime: In 1980, a white man's lifetime risk of prostate cancer was 1 in 116; today it is 1 in 6.1 (African American men have higher rates of prostate cancer). A woman's lifetime risk of breast cancer was 1 in 12 in 1980; today it is 1 in 8.1."</p>
<p>Most of this increase comes from small, less aggressive cancers. In prostate cancer, many men have cancers that would never cause them problems in their lifetime. Because of screening, they are identified and treated, often with consequences of incontinence and impotence.</p>
<p>In breast cancer, many aggressive and lethal cancers spring up quickly between mammograms and don't get caught by every-two-year screening tests, while women are treated aggressively for smaller, less threatening cancers.</p>
<p>Advanced prostate cancer and advanced breast cancer both have poor five-year survival rates. These are the diseases we need to treat aggressively and immediately.</p>
<p>The problem lies in our inability yet to identify and separate the aggressive forms of these cancers from those that require more modest treatment, or in some prostate cancer, no treatment except for watchful waiting.</p>
<p>Researchers look at the large scale results, but as individuals, what are we to do? Do we get mammograms or PSA tests?</p>
<p>The decisions are often confounded by personal experiences. In my case, taking part in a hospital study of mammograms identified a suspicious area in my breast when I was 40. Since then, I've had dozens of mammograms, many ultrasounds and needle biopsies and a small surgery to remove a benign lump. My breasts are so lumpy that I gave up doing self-exams long before it became the thing to do, and I can't count the sleepless nights of worry over nothing. I did end up with cancer, but it isn't in my breast. For me, mammograms didn't help.</p>
<p>For the Man of the House, a routine PSA turned out to be an indicator of an aggressive cancer that needed immediate treatment. He's alive almost 15 years later because his doctor believed in PSA tests.</p>
<p>The ultimate advice from all the cancer organizations is to talk with your doctor. But you need to know what to talk about. Topics should include genetic and other risk factors for the disease, possible treatments for different kinds of cancers that may be identified, and risks from identifying and treating smaller, less aggressive cancers.</p>
<p>As with H1N1, there are many experts giving us changing and sometimes conflicting advice. Our job is to sort through this in the way that makes most sense for each of us as individuals. The one factor that only you can decide is how anxious you will be with -- or without -- the flu shot or the screening tests.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Respiratory illnesses surge - Cases come as flu clinics close due to shortages</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt    </div>
<div>459 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>A surge in patients with severe respiratory problems has hit city hospitals, just as a shortage of H1N1 flu vaccine is closing down immunization clinics.</p>
<p>The number of people on ventilators for a severe respiratory illness nearly doubled in five days and at least one patient in hospital in Winnipeg has a confirmed case of severe H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Winnipeg Regional Health Authority spokeswoman Heidi Graham said 11 people were on ventilators Saturday for severe respiratory illnesses, including one confirmed and five suspected cases of H1N1. Five other patients tested negative.</p>
<p>One week ago, only six people were on ventilators with severe flu symptoms and there were no confirmed cases of severe H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>There are usually about six patients on ventilators for respiratory illnesses this time of year, Graham said.</p>
<p>"It's higher than our usual," she said.</p>
<p>The increase in suspected cases of severe flu comes just as Manitoba is poised to temporarily close H1N1 immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Late Friday, the federal government warned Manitoba Health the province will get just 15,500 doses of the vaccine this week, instead of the 72,000 doses it had expected. The provincial government announced earlier this week a national vaccine shortage would force flu clinics to shut down by Tuesday.</p>
<p>One air ambulance company confirmed it has already flown two or three patients with symptoms of influenza to hospital in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Penny Triggs, vice-president of air medical operations at Keewatin Air, would not name the remote communities where patients were medevaced from, but said nurses and pilots wear protective masks when dealing with a suspected case of H1N1. The air ambulances serve Rankin Inlet, Churchill and other remote communities in northern Manitoba.</p>
<p>During the first wave of H1N1 last spring, 38 patients were on ventilators in Winnipeg, Graham said.</p>
<p>jen.skerritt@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Flu symptoms</p>
<p>Fever, cough and any one of these symptoms: sore throat, headache, joint/muscle aches, fatigue and sometimes nausea or diarrhea.</p>
<p>What should I do if I'm sick?</p>
<p>If you're not in a high-risk group and your symptoms are mild, stay home from work or school until you feel better.</p>
<p>If you are at risk of severe flu or are concerned you need care, you should contact your nearest health-care provider.</p>
<p>Go for emergency medical care or dial 911 if you or a family member have difficulty breathing, experience severe or worsening symptoms (like increased thirst or a decrease in urination frequency), are drowsy and confused, if you have an infant under three months old with a fever, or if there any signs of serious illness in a child under five.</p>

</p>
<p>The recent increase in U.S. travellers to Cuba has led to a spike in swine flu cases on the island, Cuba's former president Fidel Castro wrote in a newspaper column published yesterday.</p>
<p>Since taking office in January, U.S. President Barack Obama has moved to ease a half-century of tension with Cuba, with small steps such as relaxing rules on visits and money transfers to the island.</p>
<p>The result: The number of cases of the A(H1N1) virus on the island has risen, the 83-year-old Castro wrote.</p>
<p>When Obama "lifted the restrictions on Cuban-Americans to travel to Cuba, the epidemic had already spread in a large number of states in that nation," wrote Castro.</p>
<p>The virus then spread "to all of the (Cuban) provinces, especially those with a large number of relatives living in the United States," he wrote.</p>

</p>
<p>I can't remember a time when I was short of column topics. Indeed, the opposite is more often true: There are more issues to write about than I have spaces for.</p>
<p>The glut of good material is particularly acute this Sunday.</p>
<p>I considered commenting on the rollout of swine flu vaccinations in Alberta. It's been uneven, at best.</p>
<p>But it has been uneven in most places.</p>
<p>The Ontario government has apologized for being unable to meet the public's demand for flu shots. So has the British Columbia government in the province that, so far, has been the hardest hit in the second round of H1N1 infections.</p>
<p>In Toronto, it had been promised that immunization centres would open three hours early. People lined up on that assumption. Then the clinics didn't open until their regular time of 9 a.m. And there were too few doses.</p>
<p>Ottawa has apologized for not getting enough vaccine to the provinces; the White House has apologized for not getting enough out to state governments. And the shortage is only going to get worse in the coming week as makers of the serum fall behind as a result of high demand.</p>
<p>Flu shots are not widgets. They cannot be stamped from sheets of metal that can be thread through the presses faster as demand rises. It takes time for the virus to be grown, time to kill it off and more time still to process, package and ship.</p>
<p>I'm no defender of our provincial government. Its members have proven their incompetence time and again. But the rollout was no worse here than elsewhere. Sure it was naive for the Stelmach government not to prioritize inoculations --high-risk groups now, lower-rise ones in a couple of weeks. But the Alberta government's foul-up was no worse than most.</p>
<p>Then I thought about taking on the high economic cost of complying with the federal government's proposed reductions in greenhouse emissions.</p>
<p>The TD Bank paid for an analysis by the David Suzuki Foundation, the Pembina Institute and M.K. Jaccard and Associates, a private economic forecasting firm. The trio estimated that to meet Ottawa's plan of a 20-per-cent reduction in greenhouses gases from 2006 levels by 2020, the national economy would have to shrink by 3.2 per cent -- a little more than it has shrunk in the current recession.</p>
<p>But the bulk of the shrinkage would come from one place, Alberta. Our province would be thrown into a depression comparable to the one it suffered in the 1980s from the National Energy Program and the worldwide collapse of energy prices.</p>
<p>Ontario, on the other hand, would grow, just as it did as a result of the NEP.</p>
<p>That, you would think, would outrage me. And it would, if I thought it would happen. There is little chance Ottawa is going to force an NEP II on Alberta. Not even if the Liberals return to power.</p>
<p>Politicians the world over pay lip service to stopping emissions, but when it comes around to actually enforcing limits, either they let their nations off the hook or they use accounting sleight of hand to make it appear they have complied.</p>
<p>Also, if Ottawa tried to beggar Alberta again to enrich Central Canada, I suspect Albertans wouldn't just stand around and let it happen this time. We would be out of Confederation in a heartbeat.</p>
<p>While there may be lots of scientific agreement about man-made global warming, there is hardly unanimity. Plenty of scientists who are not "deniers" doubt the theory. And doubt among laypersons is greater still.</p>
<p>In the face of that, few politicians would impoverish the national economy-- or even just Alberta's--for the sake of some "green" votes.</p>
<p>And I've also been giving some thought to writing about the latest effort, by a Tory backbencher from Manitoba, to dismantle the federal long-gun registry.</p>
<p>This week, Toronto's police chief made a particularly pernicious propaganda attack on Candice Hoeppner's private member's bill. Chief Bill Blair claimed that were her Bill C-391 to pass, gun owners would no longer require federal licenses to buy or possess guns and records of who owned handguns, machine guns and semi-automatics would no longer be available to police.</p>
<p>None of that is true.</p>
<p>If Ms. Hoeppner's bill passes, owners will still need to pass rigorous federal safety courses before obtaining a license, and the restricted weapon registry--the one covering handguns and automatics--would remain in place.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Canada, there has been a 24-per-cent rise in firearms murders since 2002, despite the registry.</p>
<p>Most of the increase has been through the use of handguns-which have had to be registered since 1934 -- by gangs and other criminals. More than 90 per cent of crimes in which guns are used involve the use of handguns that have never been registered.</p>
<p>So, of course, I have spent a lot of time considering writing this column about the useless of gun registration in halting crime.</p>
<p>You can see my dilemma:Too many good topics.</p>
<p>Which one to choose, then?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu-ravaged Riders bounced by optimistic Tiger-Cats; Unable to clinch playoff spot, Hamilton leaves itself in good position heading into final week; Ticats 24 Riders 6</b>
</div><div>Sean Fitz-gerald   </div>
<div>National Post; Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>When it came right down to it, the Hamilton Tiger-Cats had lost their chance to clinch a playoff spot. There was no hope of locking up home field, either, which means the greatest victory they could have claimed would be avoiding the flu dripping from the pores of their struggling opponents.</p>
<p>Everything else was about momentum heading into the regular season finale next week in Winnipeg, when the Canadian Football League playoff picture will finally be settled. And the Ticats finally seem to have recaptured some of their early-season momentum, taking advantage of a sloppy performance by the Saskatchewan Roughriders to emerge with a 24-6 win at Ivor Wynne Stadium on Saturday.</p>
<p>"We did a lot today," Hamilton centre Marwan Hage said. "If we had lost today, it would have affected next week. So today is definitely, definitely a huge win for us."</p>
<p>Ticats running back DeAndra'Cobb finished with 25 carries for 159 yards and a touchdown. It was the third straight game in which the Ticats did not allow a sack, and it was the team's second straight win, coming in spite of blustery conditions.</p>
<p>Environment Canada issued a wind warning for the region early in the afternoon, as gusts of up to 70 km/h ripped through the stands and tore across the field. It toyed with the kickers and quarterbacks from both teams, but seemed to exact a greater toll from the Roughriders, who hail from the city where wind was born.</p>
<p>The flu--reportedly not of the H1N1 variety--had swept through the Saskatchewan room before the team landed in Ontario. According to an eyewitness, the bus from the hotel to the stadium on Saturday was accompanied by a symphony of coughing, sneezing and all-around misery.</p>
<p>It is believed the flu kept about a half-dozen players from practice through different parts of the week, and it showed on the field. Roughriders quarterback Darian Durant fumbled on the 12th play of the game, and fumbled again five plays later. He was intercepted on play No. 33, also in the first quarter.</p>
<p>The Ticats had been struggling with their own ills, but those had more to do with mental well-being. Hamilton began the season with four wins in its first six games, and seemed destined to finish second in the East Division until a four-game losing streak allowed the Winnipeg Blue Bombers to creep back into the post-season picture.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan's turnovers, then, became a much-needed tonic. Ticats quarterback Kevin Glenn gave the home team a 10-0 lead in the first quarter when he found slotback Arland Bruce on a 12-yard touchdown pass.</p>
<p>Glenn marched the team to another touchdown in the second quarter, a drive capped with a 23-yard scoring run by Cobb. It gave the Ticats an 18-0 lead, and pushed the running back above 1,000 rushing yards this season, becoming the team's first 1,000-yard rusher since 2004, the last year the team made the playoffs.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan was powerless to respond. Durant had only completed eight of his 20 pass attempts heading into the fourth quarter, managing only 66 yards through the air, when he was replaced with Steven Jyles.</p>
<p>The Ticats lost their chance to clinch a playoff spot on Friday night, when the Toronto Argonauts imploded against the Edmonton Eskimos. If the Eskimos had lost, the Ticats could have clinched a berth with a win over the Roughriders.</p>
<p>It will now come down to the final week of the regular season when Hamilton (8-9) plays in Winnipeg (7-9) to decide which city will host the East Division semifinal. The Ticats have not hosted a post-season game since 2001, two years after the team's last Grey Cup win.</p>
<p>STAMPEDERS 28 LIONS 26</p>
<p>VANCOUVER / Read what you will into the Calgary Stampeders' performance on a Halloween Saturday night at B.C. Place Stadium.</p>
<p>What did it settle?Well, we already knew that the West Division title, and the right to host the Nov. 22 West Division final, won't be decided until next Saturday in Regina when the Stamps close out their regular-season schedule against the Saskatchewan Roughriders.</p>
<p>But the Stamps' gutsy 28-26 win over the Lions, thanks to a 27-yard Sandro DeAngelis field goal at the final gun, certainly gave them a mental edge heading into Regina.</p>
<p>Pretty? Not really. But it worked. Which is all you need at this point in the season as the Stamps improved to 10-6-1 and clinched a top-two finish in the West, meaning there will be a playoff game at McMahon Stadium later this month--date to be decided.</p>
<p>The Lions, meanwhile, dropped to 8-9, the same record as the Edmonton Eskimos, whom they'll play next week on this field. The winner of that matchup secures the final playoff spot in the West, while the loser may still have a chance at the crossover spot in the East.</p>

<p>There's too much hysteria over the H1N1 flu virus, just as there was with the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003.</p>
<p>H1N1 is no worse than seasonal flu, which kills 5,000 Canadians every year. Yet we are all in a panic over H1N1.</p>
<p>The media have compared H1N1 to the Spanish Influenza pandemic in 1918. That's not a valid comparison. Medicine back then was, by comparison, little better than magic chants and leeches. You might as well compare it to the plagues of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>Looking at the lineup I was in for the H1N1 flu shots Monday, it did appear as if a lot of lower-risk people were getting the shot.</p>
<p>I look to be at low risk. You cannot tell by looking at me that I have infection-triggered asthma.</p>
<p>Christmas season is approaching. Retail stores, either individually or as a group in a mall, would do well to ease lineups by sponsoring flu shots for their employees. No store wants to have lack of staff at this time. No retail worker can afford the time off due to sickness. No mall during this busy season wants to be quieted by the fear of a large flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Having employers sponsor the vaccinations would ease the burden on the public health-care system and cost less, in the long run, than having to deal with sickness.</p>

<p>Re: "Lower-risk groups clog lineups for H1N1 shots," The Journal, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>I am amazed and disappointed in the way this flu vaccine is being distributed. We are told that the vulnerable groups are young adults, pregnant women and young children. Why were these not the first ones to receive the vaccine?</p>
<p>Seniors should have been the last ones to get the shot, as we are told that they may have some immunity from past epidemics.</p>
<p>Why was there no consideration given to going into the schools? Parental consents could have been arranged ahead of time, as we have known about this potential epidemic for some time.</p>
<p>We were told that there was enough vaccine for everyone in Canada and now there is a shortage --all the more reason to have given priority to the unprotected groups.</p>

<p>Anyone with a teenager in school, especially one actively involved in sport teams, knows the difficulty of getting both you and your kid to an immunization clinic--then waiting four hours.</p>
<p>Given that teens are one of the prime targets for H1N1, I can't help but wonder why there aren't bus-loads of nurses pulling up to city high schools and running clinics in gyms.</p>
<p>Heaven knows, there is no nursing shortage--Alberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett said so in one of his first news releases.</p>
<p>Presumably, it was the same release in which he froze hiring and promised that service from Alberta Health would only get better--all of this about the same time the coming pandemic was becoming more and more imminent.</p>

<p>Re: "Province to ease flu-shot wait; Health minister publicly apologizes for long lineups," The Journal, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>So, Alberta is vaccinating 50,000 people a day for H1N1. Whoop-de-do. At that rate, it will take almost two months of people standing in these four-hour lineups to vaccinate all Albertans. And that won't happen because they are already running out of vaccine and closing many vaccination sites early.</p>
<p>The health authorities have worked for weeks to create widespread fear of this pandemic and fuelled Albertans' determination to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Then, they dropped the ball on the delivery. What a fiasco!</p>

<p>H1N1 flu clinics swamped</p>
<p>As Alberta's death toll from H1N1 influenza climbed to 14, lineups grew long this week at Calgary's five vaccination clinics, and an assessment centre was opened on Friday to diagnose and treat those with flu-like symptoms. Then on Saturday, the province announced that all immunization clinics would be closed until further notice due to an anticipated shortage of the H1N1 vaccine, although shots for high-risk patients are expected to resume soon.</p>

<p>Re: "Too few clinics," Editorial, Oct. 30.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise to any who raise their sights above the steady diet of reflex partisanship that Manitoba's New Democratic government's record of knowing what it's doing with far less and Alberta's proven incompetence to handle even prosperity comes through again. That is what happens when you consistently and automatically vote the label rather than looking for ability. Why do you think Stephen Harper snatched 10-year premier Gary Doer for a key federal role, ambassador to the U.S.--two political birds with one stone? Can you honestly imagine Ralph Klein or Ed Stelmach in that position?</p>

<p>Thank goodness, the pandemic is not Ebola-serious. Perhaps we can count this experience as just another trial. After all, we've talked about the swine flu for more than 30 years--Mike Wallace addressed the issue on 60 Minutes back in 1976. Today, hundreds of people line up for vaccinations. They stand for four to six hours; they chill in the cold. No doubt, because of it, some will get sick; some will spread disease. Priority recipients have become superfluous. Vaccination needles are used, vaccine mists are not. There is not enough serum.</p>
<p>Schools are like viral Petri dishes. So obvious. For this reason and the fact that children are considered high risk, teachers and students should have been priorities from the start.</p>
<p>Obviously, the prime architects of this dispensatory system have mismanaged the process. So what is to be done? The answer to that may mean the ultimate survival for you and me.</p>

<p>After all the hype about the importance of us all to get the H1N1 vaccine, why is anybody surprised that the few available clinics that provide the service are swamped by the demand? Why do we wait so long for emergency room care and elective surgery? Why are there not enough family doctors for everybody to have one? Where is the medical infrastructure? Why is the subject of private medicine so politically charged? Why is the health-care system sick and who is going to treat it? Where is management's foresight and leadership? Is it all about money? What are the answers to these questions and who has got them?</p>

<p>Hello, 311? Jane Taxpayer here again. I'm calling about the slogan. What's that? No, I didn't say "snow again." I said "slogan." Don't get alarmed. That snow we had last week melted all by itself, without any help from you people down at City Hall. Just as it always does, ha ha!</p>
<p>No, I'm just wondering why suddenly there's a new world order down there at command central on Macleod Trail, and we're all supposed to fall into line with it. Shades of 1984, when Oceania stopped the war with Eurasia and suddenly, Eurasia had never been the enemy at all. What? You don't see what George Orwell has to do with Calgary's slogan?</p>
<p>Are you not of a literary bent over there at 311? It is positively Orwellian that Calgary's Heart of the New West slogan is now no good. It was perfectly fine all these years, and now it's not, and we taxpayers have to pay some company in California six figures for a new slogan. How many snowplow drivers could we have paid with those six figures? You say you've never been very good at math? Trust me, 311, we've noticed.</p>
<p>Heart of the New West sounds fine to me. If it said Kidney of the New West, then I could see why we'd want to change it. But really, 311, I think we're going to have to declare war on Eurasia, or at least on Winnipeg. Their slogan is "Heart of the Continent." Where do they get off indulging in such delusions of grandeur? Just because they had 12 swine flu clinics compared to our measly five doesn't give them the right to lord it over us. They don't even have any oil! If they're going to be the heart of the continent, we should settle for nothing less than "Centre of the Universe." Nobody could ever top that, 311!</p>
<p>I've done a little research into slogans and Centre of the Universe is still up for grabs. Let's copyright it before some place like Saskatoon wises up and snatches it. I mean, Saskatoon's current slogan is Saskatoon Shines. Big deal, eh, 311? The sun shines everywhere, not just in Saskatoon! Talk about a paltry claim to fame! Are they trying to get people to believe it rains everywhere else?</p>
<p>Ottawa's slogan used to be "Technically Beautiful," but someone wised up and realized that sounds like it's not all that attractive in reality. And what do you think of "I Love Regina", 311? The city's website says this "is not just a slogan, but an emotion that drives all Reginans." I'm sure it is. What other choice do they have? "I'm Kind of Lukewarm Towards Regina"?</p>
<p>This slogan business is turning into a real cutthroat thing, eh, 311? I mean, just look what happened last week when Ald. Joe Connelly got upset at the Telus Convention Centre for using "Yes! It's Calgary" as a slogan. I'm sorry, 311, but if you have to be reminded that yes, this is Calgary, because you don't know what city was marked on your plane ticket, or where your convention is being held even as you're attending it, perhaps you shouldn't be allowed to travel without a keeper of some sort.</p>
<p>So now we taxpayers are footing the bill for Gensler, a San Francisco firm, to redefine us. That's positively dangerous, 311. I mean, it's San Francisco. We could end up with a slogan like "Calgary--We Wear Flowers In Our Hair." Look what happened when Baltimore went with the San Francisco firm Landor for its slogan. It ended up with Get In On It, which some people were frankly uneasy about. They feared it could be misread as Get It On, according to the Baltimore Business Journal. Get it on in Baltimore? I don't know, 311; sounds like a dubious place for that sort of activity. And San Antonio's slogan is "Deep. In the Heart." Ha ha, 311. Sounds like a coroner's report on where the knife wound was. Portland, Ore., calls itself "The City That Works." They've had that slogan since 1995 and they didn't spend a cent of taxpayers' money on rebranding. They held a contest for city workers to choose the slogan.</p>
<p>Of course, Calgary could never call itself The City That Works because things don't work here. We can't even get our streets plowed. What's that, 311? You say I've insulted you? Well, if you don't like it, you can go work somewhere else, you know. No, not Portland. You'd never make it in The City That Works. But you could try Regina. It says on Regina's city website, "Learn how you can love Regina, too!" You should definitely go sign up for that class, 311.</p>
<p>As for me, I'm staying right here in the Centre of the Universe.</p>

<p>British singer and pianist Sir Elton John has</p>
<p>postponed a string of concert dates due to a serious infection and flu, his official website said today.</p>
<p>John, 62, has delayed three concerts with Billy Joel in the U.S. next month as well as the final few dates of a world tour in Britain and Ireland which had previously been put on hold.</p>
<p>Promoters "were informed by management that Elton has been advised by his doctor to postpone these performances due to a serious case of e-coli bacterial infection and influenza," his website said.</p>
<p>The gigs affected are on Nov. 4 and 7 in Seattle and Nov. 10 in Portland.</p>
<p>John has reportedly spent a couple of days at an exclusive London hospital where his partner David Furnish told the Mail on Sunday: "He's OK--he's fine."</p>

<p>Only one dose of vaccine is needed for protection against pandemic H1N1 flu and the jabs have so far proved to be safe, the World Health Organization says. Health experts have been debating whether one or two shots are necessary to protect against H1N1, known as swine flu. The number of doses required is key to estimating how many vaccines are needed in total.</p>

<p>Five drug companies are increasing production of the vaccine for the H1N1 swine flu in the United States, and 10 million more doses are expected next week.</p>
<p>President Barack Obama on Friday expressed frustration about the slow pace of production of the vaccine, which has resulted in just 26.6 million doses as of Friday, far below earlier estimates of 40 million by the end of October.</p>

</p>
<p>An underfunded and over-extended public health system, currently bearing the brunt of the H1N1 pandemic, needs major reinforcement so it has the same kind of "surge capacity" that is built into hospital settings, according to the Canadian Public Health Association.</p>
<p>The system is coping as best it can with the pandemic but the redeployment of staff and resources to deal with it comes at the cost of other public health activities, Dr. Cordell Neudorf, the chair of the association said.</p>
<p>"If we are going to prepare for crises, public health needs to have a bit of surge capacity, like the rest of the system," said Neudorf.</p>
<p>"Without investing in that surge capacity, what you end up with is a workforce that is under-resourced even between crises, and then during crises, having all that prevention and promotion activity completely stopping. That's part of the issue we are trying to draw attention to."</p>
<p>Surge capacity refers to the ability to respond to a sudden increase in demand for services. The term is often heard in the context of hospital care.</p>
<p>While hospitals, doctor's offices and other primary-care facilities are certainly on the front lines of a pandemic, the burden likely falls heaviest on the public health sector of the health-care system.</p>

<p>As a thick line of hundreds of people snaked its way across the parking lot of the Whitehorn flu clinic Saturday at 10 a.m., another smaller line watched from the grass outside the gates.</p>
<p>People in both lineups--concerned mothers, fathers, grandparents and children--had waited since early morning in the hope of getting a vaccination.</p>
<p>But those outside the perimeter were waiting in vain, having been told by police just 45 minutes after the clinic opened at 8:30 a.m. that there was no chance of getting the flu shot that day.</p>
<p>Still, they waited, hoping someone might emerge from the clinic and let a few more lucky people in for a shot.</p>
<p>"We're so close," said Harjit Randhawa, standing idle with her mother and two children.</p>
<p>"Maybe we will wait for another two hours until all the other people go inside. We'll stay."</p>
<p>In front of her, taxi driver Resham Sidhu stood in line with his three children. His wife arrived at 6 a.m. to get a spot for the family. Sidhu picked up the kids and joined her at the end of his shift.</p>
<p>By morning, he'd gone 14 hours without sleep and could hardly believe it when the line was shut down by 9:15 a.m.</p>
<p>"I am very scared," said Sidhu.</p>
<p>"I drive a cab and I have contact with a lot of people, and then if I catch something, I contact people. Then I come back home and (put my children) at risk, too."</p>
<p>Up and down the line, there was surprise, frustration and concern.</p>
<p>Many of those who waited futilely outside the gates were parents.</p>
<p>They came with strollers, blankets and food. They were prepared to wait as long as it took to get the vaccination.</p>
<p>Mohammed Akhter, 41, said he didn't even care if he got the flu shot, so long as his four children did.</p>
<p>"At least there should be a line for children and pregnant women," said Akhter, adding it's unreasonable for either to have to line up overnight just to get a shot to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Fortunately, most of the frustration at the Whitehorn clinic did not boil over into trouble. Police said there had been arguments when some people tried to jump in line, but no punches were thrown.</p>
<p>Still, it was a strangely unnerving scene, with police, security and a gated fence separating families from the opportunity to get the vaccine and feel safe. Emotions are beginning to run high.</p>
<p>For Albertans, the good news is that the H1N1 virus is rarely fatal.</p>
<p>While the deaths are often high-profile and concerning, known underlying health conditions are present in 76 per cent of hospitalized cases and 93 per cent of fatalities, according to Alberta Health.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of people, the flu means a few rotten days in bed.</p>
<p>The pandemic, however, may mean more than just a few rotten days for Premier Ed Stelmach.</p>
<p>Late Saturday afternoon, the government that initially encouraged everyone to get immunized had to suspend vaccinations until further notice due to tight supplies.</p>
<p>Targeted H1N1 efforts will resume early next week, but only for those at greatest risk, like pregnant women, children aged six months to less than five years and adults under 65 with chronic health issues. The state of supply is beyond the province's control as only 400,000 new doses of the vaccine are expected to be shipped out this week to the entire country--far less than the millions federal officials had been hoping for.</p>
<p>But mixed messages from the Tory government last week about who should get the shots is not the kind of thing that instils confidence.</p>
<p>At Whitehorn, most people seemed willing to give the health system time to sort things out, but that was before the decision to suspend the flu clinics.</p>
<p>There was frustration with the government early Saturday that it didn't plan well enough for a pandemic it knew had been coming for months.</p>
<p>Indeed, for some people, it only cemented opinions.</p>
<p>"I've never voted (for Stelmach) and I never will," said Val Alvarez, who was turned away for a second time this week with her two children.</p>
<p>"He's the one that said there was going to be enough (vaccine) for everybody and everybody was going to get it. Obviously, it's not so.</p>
<p>"They're not giving you answers. They're just making people mad."</p>
<p>There's no question that the coming weeks will be critical, not only for the health system but for the government itself.</p>
<p>And the people standing outside the Whitehorn gates won't only be watching those lucky enough to get a flu shot. They'll be watching the government closely, too.</p>

</p>
<p>T hrough the long, cold hours of waiting in the dark early Saturday for a flu shot, instant friendships sprang up, leading to shared snacks, coffee runs, bathroom strategies and, in one case, unexpected self-sacrifice.</p>
<p>Mom Kathleen Wilson says she "panicked" when told by a loudspeaker-wielding official outside the Brentwood Village mall clinic that the lineup for inoculations had reached its maximum of 3,000 and that no one else would be allowed to join the queue.</p>
<p>She had been in line since 5:30 a.m., saving a place for her five-year-old son, James, a severe asthmatic who was waiting at home with her husband, Bob, and their three-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>"They came out with a loudspeaker five minutes before their opening time (8:30 a.m.) and she said, 'The lineup has been cut off at London Drugs and nobody else can be added to the line. If your kids aren't here, they will not be receiving a shot.' "</p>
<p>A complete stranger came to the rescue.</p>
<p>Maria Pahl immediately offered to give up her shot to make sure James got his immunization.</p>
<p>"They can't change the rules like that," said Pahl later in disgust. She was in line with her six-year-old twin boys and a seven-year-old son.</p>
<p>"We're not here for us, we're here for the kids," she said, adding, "I don't need the shot as bad as they do."</p>
<p>She added that one of her three sons has asthma and needs the vaccine but, if necessary, she would have given up her other sons' spots for someone who needed it more desperately.</p>
<p>As it turned out, her husband and children arrived just in time and the whole family was allowed into the clinic.</p>
<p>With all five of Calgary's H1N1 immunization clinics cutting off access to lineups by 9:15 a.m., line dwellers relied on each other, sharing jokes, complaining about the system, watching each others' children and holding each others' places while they went to warm up in vehicles.</p>
<p>A clearly uniting issue Saturday morning was a bathroom strategy, a desperate situation at the Richmond Road clinic in the former Alberta Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>One woman in obvious distress said she walked all the way around the former hospital without finding an unlocked door that might lead to a bathroom.</p>
<p>A linemate, overhearing the conversation, provided directions to a "clump of bushes" on the north side of the building. After some doubting looks, the first woman left to go check it out.</p>
<p>Offering relief at Avenida Village mall clinic was Boston Pizza.</p>
<p>"We opened the doors at 9 a.m., normally we open at 11,"</p>
<p>said assistant manager Neil Chapman. "We let everyone come in and use the washroom, give people some free coffee and free pizza bread."</p>
<p>He conceded the restaurant is doing a good business with its captive audience, a sentiment not shared by all of its neighbouring businesses, some of which had security guards warding off flu shot seekers to preserve parking spots for paying customers.</p>
<p>Leaving the clinic at the Olympic Oval after getting his shot, Rob Reid said everyone he had met since lining up at 5 a.m. was helpful and polite.</p>
<p>"I think people are really coming together. People were giving up their seats (inside the clinic) for the elderly," he said.</p>
<p>Outside, in the lineup, Andrew Bzdel of Cochrane was a</p>
<p>favourite with his neighbours who lined up at about 7 a.m. after he shared his box of Timbits. But he said the goodwill goes both ways.</p>
<p>"You know, people are watching other kids while you chase yours around. Everybody (is) in pretty good spirits," Bzdel said.</p>
<p>Carl Roett, 32, a part-time photographer, went to Brentwood Village around 4 a.m. to take some pictures and get a flu shot. The long lineup dissuaded him from being inoculated but inspired him to go for coffee.</p>
<p>"I went and grabbed about 25 cups of coffee. It wasn't very expensive and the <span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> (on 16th Avenue N.W.) actually gave me a bunch of coffee for free," he said.</p>
<p>"I just threw them in the back of my truck, drove over there and handed them out. People looked really cold."</p>
<p>Francis Ho arrived at the Avenida clinic at 2 a.m. to save a place for his wife, five children and his father-in-law. He said he's amazed by how well-behaved everyone has been.</p>
<p>"We were all commenting that in some countries the military would be out to maintain control, but everybody's been really good. . . people are helping each other," he said.</p>
<p>"One lady said, 'I'm going to go to my car to warm up. Will you hold my seat?' We said, 'Oh, yeah,' " he said. "People were asking, 'I'm going to Tim's, can I get you anything?' It's great."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tories will have to wear this fiasco</b>

</p>
<p>There's no swine flu panic here in B.C., no sudden shutdown of clinics and only modest lineups by Alberta's standards.</p>
<p>That's because the B.C. government has never opened mass clinics. Like most other provinces, B.C. is stockpiling flu shots the general public won't see (or feel) for weeks. You'd think many people would be upset by that, but they don't seem to be. By confining shots to high-risk groups for now, B.C. hasn't unleashed mass lines and escalating competition for vaccine.</p>
<p>Alberta veered from the national norm by opening general clinics at the start. The impulse was generous and probably medically sound; but with a fatal flaw.</p>
<p>There weren't enough clinics. As the lines grew longer every day, something like hysteria erupted--and officials weren't ready for it.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the province suddenly shut down all the clinics. The official reason is the vaccine shortage suddenly revealed by Ottawa.</p>
<p>But even if supplies were ample, the public health officials were on the edge of a crisis they created. They simply didn't supply enough access points to meet the huge demand they completely failed to anticipate.</p>
<p>In hindsight, it's almost beyond belief that they only set up 10 clinics for two million people in Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p>B.C., by contrast, will have dozens of smaller clinics when H1N1 vaccination starts for the public (high-risk people are already getting shots). So B.C. looks smart by holding back vaccine. I'm not sure it should; people surely have a right to the vaccine as soon as it's available.</p>
<p>But Alberta's more generous policy, risky from the start, proved chaotic and ultimately disastrous.</p>
<p>Not much will infuriate and frighten people more than offering vaccine, giving it to some and then pulling them back from others. The result is a stunning policy and public relations fiasco.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach and his government will take the heat for this. The uproar could even have an impact on the Tory leadership review in Red Deer on Nov. 7.</p>
<p>It seems to be yet more proof that this government is disaster-prone. For Stelmach himself, the timing could not be worse.</p>
<p>The political mistake was to uncritically accept the advice of the public health officials, even though it was different advice than other provinces were getting.</p>
<p>The Alberta experts wanted to vaccinate as many people as possible, as soon as possible, to check the spread of the flu. For a while it worked--300,000 Albertans have already had their shots.</p>
<p>But officials were fooled by the anti-vaccine campaign that seemed to be steering people away from getting shots. Even polls suggested take-up would be low.</p>
<p>It was not. As soon as Albertans realized what's at stake--widespread infection that's especially dangerous for children--they headed for the clinics in hordes. The long campaign to convince us this flu is serious finally clicked in.</p>
<p>Now that the clinics are shut down, it's easy for our authorities to blame the unexpected drop in vaccine production.</p>
<p>That's a problem, no doubt about it. But Alberta had screwed up the vaccine campaign long before word of the shortage came late Thursday.</p>
<p>Ultimately the government is responsible. And the Tories will wear this fiasco like a loud shirt at a funeral.</p>

<p>I've just finished a shift in the emergency room. Despite my 32 years' experience in nursing, it astounds me that the general population cannot follow a few simple, emergency-room rules - especially now with the H1N1 epidemic.</p>
<p>A few words of advice:</p>
<p>Please wear a mask if you are coughing or have a fever. The mask must cover your nose.</p>
<p>If you're asked to wait in a different waiting room, please be compliant, and have a little understanding. Please do not bring your family to that waiting room.</p>
<p>If the nurses ask you to limit bedside visitors to one, there is a reason - a safety and health reason.</p>
<p>Please do not request chairs if there is no room for them.</p>
<p>Please do not keep asking like a child how much longer you'll have to wait. It's not a first-come-first-served system, but one based on priority.</p>
<p>Please do not swear at the nurses or resort to name-calling; it is counter-productive.</p>
<p>Please read the signs. Where it says "Do not enter," do not enter.</p>
<p>Please follow the isolation protocol. By doing so, you are protecting yourself and the patient and the general population.</p>
<p>It's time to consider what impact your behaviour will have on others.</p>

<p>Re: "More afraid of the vaccine" (Letters, Oct. 29).</p>
<p>I really wasn't sure if I should laugh or cry after reading the letter from the reader who was more afraid of the vaccine than the flu. You can bet your butt she'll be in my ER at the first sign of a cough, begging for Tamiflu. Allow me to dispel a few rumours.</p>
<p>This vaccine is made the same as all the other flu vaccines we've been getting for decades. You can't get the flu from it. While it's not 100-per-cent effective, it's a lot more effective than sitting home and worrying.</p>
<p>Second, doctors are not in the pockets of vaccine companies, and are not paid to push vaccine. My only incentive is to keep you all healthy so you're not lined up around the block outside my ER every time you have a cough.</p>
<p>Third, there are very specific guidelines as to who gets screened and who gets treated. You don't get screened just because you're curious. You get screened if you're going to be admitted or treated, which occurs only if you're at risk of complications due to such conditions as diabetes, heart disease, pregnancy, asthma, and compromised immune system.</p>
<p>If you just think you might have H1N1, stay home, rest, drink plenty of fluids, take acetaminophen or ibuprophen, and keep your germs to yourself.</p>
<p>Do come to ER if you're short of breath, have a change in mental status, are unable to keep down fluids, or seem to be getting worse after getting better.</p>

<p>Moments after a public health official declared the Kanata H1N1 clinic to be running "tickety boo," 11-year-old Sarah Bricker lost consciousness. She went pale, her knees buckled and she collapsed, hitting her head against the linoleum floor.</p>
<p>Her parents and a nurse rushed to her side, while one of her little brothers began to cry. It happened just after the family of six received their shots in the clinic set up on the second floor of the Kanata Recreation Complex.</p>
<p>In a few minutes, the girl was able to get up. With help, she walked to the back of the room, where she was treated by paramedics. According to her mother, Jill McAninch, Sarah has always been nervous about needles. "Her brothers are diabetic. They get two needles a day," McAninch said. "She sees them all the time, but she can't wrap her head around it for herself."</p>
<p>Sarah's anxiety yesterday started when her mother came home with wristbands for every member of the family. "She was a walking wreck until she got the needle," her mom said.</p>
<p>McAninch dragged herself out of bed at 4:30 a.m., made it to the clinic by 5:30 a.m. and was back home by 8 a.m. Her mission was to secure vaccination spots for the two boys, aged 7 and 9, who are considered priority cases because of their diabetes, but she was happy to get wristbands for everyone in the household.</p>
<p>Because she works during the week, Saturday morning was the only time to get it done, even though it meant some of the children had to miss hockey. McAninch felt the system to get the shots worked "quite seamlessly," but it was still a stressful, disruptive day. Sarah was later taken to the hospital as a precaution.</p>
<p>"It's not been the best day," McAninch admitted. "I was hoping we could time it so that my son could at least get half an hour on the ice, but that's not going to happen."</p>
<p>Stittsville residents Sabrina and Michael Kemp were equally determined to secure vaccinations for their two boys, ages one and three. "I did a lot of research and I felt that the risks were small enough with the vaccine, although I feel the risks for the virus are pretty low as well, but I wouldn't be able to forgive myself if something happened and I hadn't got them vaccinated," Kemp said.</p>
<p>Saturday was their third try at getting the shots. They attempted it twice earlier in the week, but became frustrated when the clinic began handing out the wristbands earlier than advertised. Kemp contacted her city councillor, Shad Quadri, to complain.</p>
<p>"With two little kids, I had no idea what time to come, so I showed up an hour and a half early, only to find out that they had already started three hours before," Kemp said. The wristband system made it a much smoother process on Saturday.</p>
<p>Thelma and Mark Gall, who were waiting in line with three youngsters in need of naps, also made two earlier attempts to get their shots. "We were here Thursday and Friday and by the time we showed up, they had already handed out all the numbers," Thelma Gall said.</p>
<p>Jeff Conrad checked the city's Twitter feed before he headed out to line up in Kanata at 5:45 a.m., aiming to get wristbands for himself, his wife and their four-year-old twin daughters. His wife, Suzanne Savoie, felt it went smoothly, although the appointments were running about an hour behind schedule.</p>
<p>"They're missing dance lessons at noon, but we think this is important," said Savoie.</p>

Bricker, 11, briefly lost consciousness and hit her head on the
floor after getting her H1N1 inoculation. Paramedic Michael Bowen
was quickly by her side to tend to her and assess possible injury.
After a few minutes, she was able to get up. According to her
mother, Jill McAninch, Sarah has always been nervous about needles.

</p>
<p>With the number of swine flu cases doubling each week and a sharp rise in the rates of flu-like illness at hospital emergency rooms, public-health officials in Ottawa are preparing to launch a network of medical clinics to assess and treat flu patients as early as this week.</p>
<p>Preparations are being made to ensure the clinics have enough medical supplies before they are activated, the city's medical officer of health said Saturday. "I believe that we'll probably be heading towards flu centres into the new week," said Dr. Isra Levy.</p>
<p>The clinics are aimed at people with flu symptoms who don't have family doctors, or who can't appointments to see them within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Up to 10 flu centres across the city could be ready to operate within 48 to 72 hours of being activated. These clinics -- at existing community health centres, family health teams and urgent-care centres -- are designed to divert people away from crowded emergency rooms to primary-care doctors and nurses, who could assess patients and determine whether they need antiviral medication to help limit the seriousness of their symptoms.</p>
<p>Over the past week, the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario and Queensway Carleton Hospital have been overwhelmed by people with flu-like illnesses, prompting the hospitals to expand their emergency departments, reduce service in outpatient clinics and impose restrictions on visitors.</p>
<p>Levy said the growing pressure on hospitals is a sign extra flu centres are needed.</p>
<p>"It's the amount of activity in the community and the fact that people need access to care. We know that there are some individuals in the community that don't have primary-care physicians. So (we're) trying to provide some kind of support and infrastructure for that."</p>
<p>Public-health officials have been monitoring the steadily rising rates of H1N1 flu, which have continued to double each week since the start of October. To date, of 161 lab-confirmed cases, 41 people have been hospitalized and one person has died, said Levy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, thousands of early risers braved the rain on Saturday for a chance at one of the city-issued numbered wristbands, which guaranteed people a place in line at the half-dozen clinics open over the weekend. City officials developed the system to allow residents to wait at home instead of in cold, outdoor lineups. But the wristbands garnered mixed reviews on Saturday, the first day they were used, with several clinics running out even before they opened.</p>
<p>The lineups appeared to be especially long at the Orléans Client Service Centre, where 700 wristbands were handed out and hundreds more people were turned away.</p>
<p>Among those in line were Eve Holmes, who suffers from asthma, along with her husband, Simon, and one of their two young sons. Holmes brought her family to the Orléans service centre at 6:30 a.m., only to find a lineup had already formed around the block.</p>
<p>"The people at the front of the line told us they had been there since one in the morning," said Holmes.</p>
<p>By the time the family reached the front of the line, they were told there were no more wristbands for the day. Even so, Holmes waited for another four hours and was eventually let in by a triage nurse, who was stationed at the entrance to screen for priority groups such as parents with young children.</p>
<p>At the Vanier-Richelieu Community Centre, about 200 people were in line by 5:15 a.m. By 6:30 a.m., clinic staff had started handing out wristbands; an hour later, all 450 wristbands were given out.</p>
<p>Two tents were set up next to the Vanier centre to keep those waiting out of the rain. By mid-morning, the mood in the crowd was a mixture of relief and resignation; staff tried to lighten things up by handing out Halloween treats.</p>
<p>"I don't really think the shot is necessary, but I might as well prevent it," said 14-year-old Martin Pitre as he headed into the clinic with his parents.</p>
<p>Across town, people at the front of the line at the Kanata Recreation Complex told the Citizen they had been lining up since 2 a.m. The clinic there handed out the last of 1,400 wristbands at 8:50 a.m. In one hour, between 11 a.m. and noon, about 200 people were given their shots. Security guards manning the entrance kept a close watch on the steady flow of people entering the building.</p>
<p>As of 10:15 a.m., city officials at the Constellation Building in Centrepointe said they had distributed 650 wristbands, and were waiting for approval to distribute more. More than 200 people, most equipped with umbrellas, were still lined up in the driving rain, waiting for the line to move again.</p>
<p>Jeff Patten was one of the successful wristband seekers at Centrepointe. After his wife waited in line for two hours, he took over her spot. Less than half an hour later, he went home with four wristbands and instructions to return at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>"We've been sitting on the fence with this," he said. "But we felt for the kids, it's better to be safe than sorry." He and his wife have a 10-year-old with asthma, and a four-year-old.</p>
<p>At the Tom Brown Arena in Hintonburg, clinic staff started handing out wristbands at 7:15 a.m., 15 minutes earlier than planned. By then, about 150 people had already lined up in the parking lot in the pre-dawn rain. A little more than an hour later, the city's website had announced that the Tom Brown site was no longer accepting new clients, except for frontline health-care workers.</p>
<p>The region's shortest lineup appeared to be in Chesterville, about 50 kilometres southeast of Ottawa, where people who showed up on Saturday afternoon were able to be vaccinated within 40 minutes.</p>
<p>Public-health officials said that 6,300 people were vaccinated Saturday. Also, 14,000 doses of the vaccine were sent to area hospitals for continued vaccination of employees.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Correction</p>
<p>People over 65 are not one of the priority groups for H1N1 vaccinations. Incorrect information appeared on page A1 on Saturday. The Citizen apologizes for any inconvenience this may have caused.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Weekend clinic tips</p>
<p>It's the first weekend of flu clinics. Here's what you need to know:</p>
<p>- Hours everywhere are 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Besides the five clinics that are open every day, the Alfred Taylor Community Centre in North Gower is open Sunday only.</p>
<p>- At 7:30 a.m., staff at all clinics are to start handing out numbered wristbands to those lined up. You can tie one to your wrist or just carry it, but don't attach it in a way that covers up the number. Unless you're near the front of the line, you'll be told what time of day to return for a shot. Return late, and you'll lose your priority and have to start over.</p>
<p>- If you're a parent, you don't need to bring your children to get their wristbands. Staff just need to see one adult, and will distribute enough bands for one household.</p>
<p>- Today and for the coming week, shots are still reserved for priority groups: children aged six months to five years, health-care workers, people between six months and 65 years old with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women and caregivers of children under six months old. Older children aren't considered a priority, but won't be turned away. This is run largely on the honour system, but staff have been questioning those who do not appear to be a priority and asking those who do not meet requirements to come back when clinics are open to all.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Forget that lame-duck label for Gaston</b>
</div><div>619 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>It didn't take long after it was confirmed that he'll be back as Jays manager next spring for Cito Gaston to be stuck with the lame-duck label.</p>
<p>Why is it that coaches and managers on one-season deals (Gaston has an extension, but in an already agreed-to consultant's role) are perceived as hamstrung and emasculated while players in a similar end-of-contract situation are seen as being blessed with incentive and inspiration?</p>
<p>A lot of it has to do with a manager's role as den father and disciplinarian.</p>
<p>If the players know he's not going to be around for the long haul they might not take him as seriously and even go so far as to ignore or defy his authority.</p>
<p>Wait a second ... isn't that precisely what the Jays (some of them, anyway) did this past September, turn on their manager? In other words, it can happen any time, regardless of tenure.</p>
<p>As for players somehow jacking up their performances in their so-called "contract years," it has been proven time and again that there's no incentive to compare with the promise of big money and security. That there is often a subsequent drop-off in performance is no surprise, either, humans being human and all.</p>
<p>This deal makes it possible to replace Gaston at any time without unduly embarrassing him or costing him a nickel in the longer term. Those players unhappy with him now, at least, have a deadline within which to operate. But they also must understand that he has significant input in the organization for at least five years. He'll still be around after many of them are long gone.</p>
<p>If it feels like a compromise, so be it. There are worse strategies.</p>
<p>But Gaston is a winner here, not a loser, an ace in this shuffle of the deck.</p>
<p>He has received the blessing of both Paul Beeston and Alex Anthopoulos. He has heavyweight backup.</p>
<p>Lame duck? Gaston will certainly try to embellish his managerial legacy, not tarnish it. He'll still try to win as many games as possible.</p>
<p>Who knows, his players may even get on the program.</p>
<p>AND, FURTHERMORE: As an organization that is supposed to represent team players, the NHLPA has far too many me-first members. ... As the NFL comes under increasingly intense grilling regarding its players' alarming head/brain injuries, its representatives are being compared to cigarette industry apologists who for decades insisted their products had nothing to do with lung cancer. ... While the Jays would like to get out from under the onerous Vernon Wells contract, it is inconceivable that they might, as rumoured, deal him to the Cubs for Milton Bradley. The latter is a clubhouse toxin, just the opposite of what the newer-look Jays should be all about. ... There's a temptation to say that against the Raptors, Shaquille O'Neal looked like only a shadow of his formerly formidable self. But that's some blown-up, slow-moving shadow, isn't it? ... TV talker Jimmy Fallon: "First the swine flu's a big threat, then it's not, then it is. Make up your mind. This thing's like the Brett Favre of infectious diseases." ... Relax - you could be a Browns fan. Cleveland's pride and shame are 55-113 since coming back 10 years ago. They've scored four TDs in their last 81 possessions. ... Or, you could be a Raiders fans. Says Oakland QB JaMarcus Russell: "Just take my word that things are going to get better. I can't tell you when, but I know they are."</p>

<p>MDs say rules deter them from</p>
<p>providing H1N1 shots, Oct. 28</p>
<p>The Coalition of Family Physicians of Ontario (COFP) believes the vast majority of Ontario's family doctors want to provide the H1N1 vaccination to their patients. After all, we have been providing vaccinations of all types for generations.</p>
<p>The problem, however, stems from top-down bureaucratic decision-making, which once again seems to have occurred without input from family doctors. It makes no sense to suddenly foist an onerous, bureaucratic protocol upon family doctors that takes them away from being able to look after their patients and provide them with vaccinations. Rather than requiring us to complete yet another form, couldn't public health alleviate the workload of family doctors by providing a hotline for patients to call and provide the details the bureaucrats want?</p>
<p>COFP believes patients prefer to get their vaccines from their own family doctor rather than standing for hours in long lines. By trying to revamp an efficient, well-established system of vaccine provision that has served the health-care system well, the government's scheme has only resulted in an unacceptable delay of the public's access to the vaccine. Ontario family doctors and their patients deserve better.</p>

</p>
<p>Hundreds queue for H1N1 flu shots,</p>
<p>Oct. 29</p>
<p>In your article Progressive Conservative health critic Christine Elliott (Whitby-Oshawa) is quoted as calling for the province to operate vaccination clinics around the clock and at workplaces.</p>
<p>As a registered nurse working on the front lines at an H1N1 clinic, I am not sure where Elliott is intending to find more RNs to staff clinics for 24 hours a day.</p>
<p>Nurses, in particular, have borne the burden of past funding cuts and restructuring. Quality care is increasingly a challenge to deliver given the heavy workloads and understaffing nurses face each and every day. In case Elliott has forgotten, the current shortage of nurses was exacerbated during the previous Conservative government under both Mike Harris and Ernie Eves.</p>
<p>Nurses are already working as many hours as possible to help protect Ontarians. RNs, like most Ontarians, also have families to care for and many are single mothers who have to scramble to make alternate arrangements in order to staff clinics during the evening and weekends.</p>

</p>
<p>A swine flu outbreak may be the catalyst reluctant employers need to embrace telework in the workplace.</p>
<p>Working from home while staying in touch with the office via telephone, e-mail and other forms of communication is hardly a new concept, but telework enthusiasts say employers have been slow to introduce it.</p>
<p>That may change this year if companies find themselves relying on telework programs to keep their business running in a time of crisis, according to Bob Klay of Klay Information Management Consulting Ltd.</p>
<p>"You need to be prepared to really protect your business," Klay told delegates at a recent Calgary business forum.</p>
<p>Telework could help maintain business continuity in many situations, such as a reduced workforce due to illness or unforeseen events like the loss of a building or loss of IT, he said.</p>
<p>Peter Tertzakian, chief energy economist for ARC Financial Corp. and bestselling author, said telework is part of a broader societal change that could help change the current North American lifestyle, which has been defined by energy.</p>
<p>The high price of gasoline may also bring changes to the workplace, Tertzakian said.</p>
<p>"There's no question that high energy prices are going to be a catalyst, particularly high oil prices, and I believe we're looking at the trigger point right in the face right now," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Draw up flu crisis plan; H1N1 advice: It's 'not too late' to keep your business operating</b>
</div><div>Frank Luba   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>506 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A32</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>It's not too late to put together a crisis plan to keep your business operating during the current H1N1 influenza infection, according to Anne Kinvig of Pacific Blue Cross.</p>
<p>"But they [businesses] should do it quickly," said Kinvig, senior vice-president of human resources for the health benefits provider, after speaking to a Vancouver Board of Trade meeting Friday.</p>
<p>Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer of Vancouver Coastal Health, said the H1N1 infection still hasn't hit its peak -- although it could be near.</p>
<p>But she couldn't be precise about when that peak will occur.</p>
<p>"We won't know that until the peak is past," Daly said.</p>
<p>Having a plan is the best way to deal with the infection and it has allowed Vancouver Coastal to keep absenteeism due to the flu to below five per cent, Daly said.</p>
<p>Pacific Blue Cross began planning in June for the expected second wave of H1N1, said Kinvig, but has still seen close to 10 per cent of its workforce affected.</p>
<p>The key component for the company was business continuity -- making sure it could continue to operate during a pandemic.</p>
<p>"For us, that is critical," Kinvig said. "If we weren't able to have staff to process disability payments, it would be a big reputational issue for our organization -- because we're impacting people's livelihoods."</p>
<p>The company developed its H1N1 play by building on its existing plans for disasters such as an earthquake.</p>
<p>A key was identifying a mission- critical function, which for Pacific Blue Cross was paying claimants, Kinvig said.</p>
<p>Different plans were established for different levels of absent staff.</p>
<p>There was plenty of easy-to-access information.</p>
<p>Kinvig said each company has to determine how it is going to react to staff shortages, whether that be through more overtime or more hours for part-time workers.</p>
<p>Her company even has a contingency plan to put 100 PCs into workers' home so they can process claims without having to come into the office.</p>
<p>The health of both the company and its employees is critical, she said.</p>
<p>"It's really about trying to find that balance," Kinvig said.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, drugstore chain Pharmasave has an H1N1 plan.</p>
<p>The 20 employees at the company's B.C. headquarters were briefed on the plan and given a kit that included masks, gloves and sanitizer, said B.C. CEO Dave Reston.</p>
<p>"I know our staff was very appreciative," Reston said.</p>
<p>Each of the company's 111 B.C. outlets are independently owned. They were presented with detailed information but it was left to each owner to institute plans.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Torch lights up the Island; Crowds line the streets to cheer on the runners</b>
</div><div>Damian Inwood   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>726 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Crowds of people, many in Halloween costumes, turned out to greet the Olympic torch yesterday.</p>
<p>And while it was just a little bit scary, it was a nice kind of spooky.</p>
<p>Unlike Friday night, when a "zombie march" by protesters disrupted the relay route in pouring rain, it was a day for cheering and smiling in bright sunshine, as the relay made its way up Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>"We're seeing all the enthusiasm that people have always had for the Olympics," said Premier Gordon Campbell.</p>
<p>"I was just in Cowichan and there were hundreds of people lining the roads of a small town. Kids are excited and their parents and grandparents are excited."</p>
<p>The torch set off from Sooke early Saturday morning.</p>
<p>It was carried by runners, on mountain bikes -- and even made a quick side trip by floatplane to Saltspring Island.</p>
<p>Then it carried on to Duncan and Nanaimo for a big evening concert.</p>
<p>In Duncan, streets were lined with people waiting to see the torch.</p>
<p>"That was awesome," said administrative assistant Tracy Hack as the torch went by.</p>
<p>Hack, sporting devil's horns, brought her four-year-old son David, dressed as Iron Man, to see the flame.</p>
<p>"I like the Olympic sports," she said. "I used to ski in Alberta."</p>
<p>The runners were thrilled too.</p>
<p>Linda Tremblay, a TV sports producer from Vancouver, was waiting anxiously to light her torch outside the local street market.</p>
<p>"I am so excited and so thrilled," said Tremblay. "I have been to four Olympic Games and I've always dreamed of carrying the torch."</p>
<p>Torchbearer Stephen Recalma, 24, of Qualicum Beach, a past-member of the First Nations snowboard team, said he feels good about the Olympics coming.</p>
<p>"It was amazing, a good feeling," Recalma said, after finishing his 300-metre run. "Everyone was yelling and taking pictures."</p>
<p>Four-time Paralympian Richard Peter, a Cowichan native wheelchair basketball player, was showing off his Paralympic silver medal after he carried the torch in a special clamp attached to his wheelchair.</p>
<p>"It's a great honour to carry the torch," he said. "It's a great occasion -- and the sun came out."</p>
<p>Peter, 37, who won two golds and a silver medal and who now lives in Vancouver, was chosen to light the cauldron at the lunchtime celebration.</p>
<p>"In Athens, I took a few photos with the cauldron, and in Beijing. But this is the first I've been able to carry it," he said. "I'm enjoying every minute of it."</p>
<p>At the Duncan lunchtime party, hand-knitted Cowichan sweaters were the common attire of choice.</p>
<p>Any bitterness over the "fake Cowichan sweater" controversy surrounding the <span class="companylink">Hudson's Bay Co</span>.'s Olympic clothing seemed to have melted away.</p>
<p>Cowichan Tribes Chief Lydia Hwitsum said the band is happier now that it has reached a deal to sell real Cowichan sweaters in HBC Olympic stores.</p>
<p>"I would say we've breathed some life into it in terms of the economic opportunities we've leveraged for the short term for the Olympics," she said. "And HBC has agreed to some longer-term marketing opportunities."</p>
<p>Hwitsum said that about 50 Cowichan knitters will be making one sweater a week each, some with the Olympic rings design, between now and the start of 2010.</p>
<p>n Vancouver 2010 torch relay staff have jumped the queue to receive H1N1 vaccination. Relay spokeswoman Suzanne Reeves said the group got inoculated on the advice of the Vancouver Island Health Authority.</p>
<p>"When the health authority heard about the nature of the torch relay and the communities we are going into, the recommendation was that folks working on the relay get inoculated," said Reeves. "The torch relay will be in contact with 90 per cent of the population and we are going to remote communities. The responsible thing is to ensure that we are not carrying disease to these communities."</p>
<p>Reeves said that relay staff are in a fairly healthy and young demographic, which is the group that is getting hit by swine flu. Staff members were vaccinated by Victoria medical staff at the Empress Hotel, the relay's headquarters.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 knocks BCHL's Victoria Grizzlies down, but not out</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>415 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>Influenza 1, Victoria Grizzlies 0.</p>
<p>That's the way the last night's B.C. Hockey League scoreboard should have read.</p>
<p>With nearly half the roster down and out with the flu, the Grizzlies had to postpone their scheduled game with the Nanaimo Clippers.</p>
<p>The decision was made yesterday morning, when Grizzlies coaches realized they couldn't find enough healthy players to fill the lineup.</p>
<p>"We're looking to send all the kids to doctors and not have them come back to the rink until they're healthy," said coach Victor Gervais.</p>
<p>Fear of flu-like symptoms has hit the minor-hockey world hard since the death of a 13-year-old player in Toronto last week.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio, who played for the AA Mississauga North Stars, became sick after playing in a weekend tournament. He was sent home last Sunday from a walk-in clinic and advised to use an over-the-counter medication. Less than a day later, he was dead.</p>
<p>"A lot of the kids are worried," Gervais said. "I'm actually getting sick, too, and I can imagine how they feel."</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, a Grizzlies player tested positive for the H1N1 virus. He has since returned to the ice. None of his teammates tested positive for the virus as of yesterday, but Gervais was being cautious.</p>
<p>David Sales, executive director of the Junior A minor-hockey league, said the BCHL hasn't taken action with respect to H1N1, except to reiterate a Hockey Canada advisory regarding health measures to limit the spread of germs.</p>
<p>As for trying to keep the flu bug out of the dressing room goes, the Grizzlies feel they have done about as much as possible.</p>
<p>"You can't see it and you don't know who's got it," said John Smith, the assistant equipment manager.</p>
<p>Before the season started, the Grizzlies had a company called Medallion Healthy Homes of Canada use an ozone treatment to sanitize their dressing room. Now they're using a smaller machine designed to do the same thing.</p>
<p>Shower stalls -- supplied with liquid, rather than bar soap -- are disinfected regularly. Players use individual water bottles. Towels are not shared and are replaced with new ones for each period during games. And hand-pumped sanitizers are "everywhere," Smith said.</p>
<p>"We've tried everything to not spread it," he said, "but it doesn't seem to be working."</p>

<p>The vast majority of healthy children in B.C. have to wait until mid-November to get immunized for the H1N1 virus, even though the median age of those most affected is 15. Moreover, the goal of vaccinating at least 50 per cent of the population by the end of the year translates into 44,000 shots per day for the 45 days remaining until the end of the year.</p>
<p>In other provinces, such as Alberta, they are using a triage system whereby high-risk groups in any given day are immunized first, but no one is turned away.</p>
<p>Children under 15 should not be turned away.</p>

</p>
<p>When I get sick, I like to snuggle under a warm quilt and feel sorry for myself.</p>
<p>I like people to bring me Jell-O and tea. It is also mandatory that a television remote controller be close at hand.</p>
<p>I can't imagine being forced to walk around town carrying or pushing all my belongings with me because I have nowhere to lay my fevered head. That is an unimaginable torment.</p>
<p>Those of us with homes need to think about what happens to homeless people who are sick. Where do they go to recuperate? Who looks after them?</p>
<p>In days of old, when people had no one to care for them during times of illness, they could count on the acute care hospital. That is no longer the case.</p>
<p>A homeless person with an illness that is not life-threatening won't get a bed at the hospital in Kamloops. There is simply no bed to give him or her.</p>
<p>In fact, a seriously ill man was released from the Kamloops hospital recently only to die several days later. The local medical community was not to blame. His illness was chronic and he fit the criteria of a patient who should be released.</p>
<p>He was no longer acutely ill, only chronically ill, and physicians are pressured to get those patients out of an acute care bed even if there is no other suitable place for them.</p>
<p>He left the hospital for the Kamloops Christian Men's Hostel, which was his last option. Unfortunately, he threw up there and was tossed out until he could bring a note from his doctor saying he was not contagious. They have 38 other men to care for and can't risk an outbreak of stomach flu.</p>
<p>But it seems a heartless way to treat someone who might have an intestinal problem. That would seem to be the time a person might need to be in bed and close to a bathroom.</p>
<p>Most people, even those without money, have some dignity and they don't really want to return to a place where they've been embarrassed.</p>
<p>So this sick man didn't come back and a couple of days later, he succumbed to his chronic illness. It was an inevitable end, but also an example of what happens when the acute care medical system is underfunded.</p>
<p>Before Liberal MLAs Kevin Krueger and Terry Lake write letters saying how much more money is being spent on health care than ever before, let's admit it's difficult to properly fund the black financial hole of medicine.</p>
<p>Yet something is wrong when a sickly man who was in ICU two days earlier is deemed well enough to leave a hospital bed because someone else needs it more. That dramatically proves more beds are needed somewhere.</p>
<p>This story raises the question as to how many other vulnerable people have died or suffered because the medical care is not in place to look after them when they are sick.</p>
<p>Emergency room staff are the front line in these cases. The pressure must be tremendous on nurses and doctors who have to decide what to do with patients who are not sick enough to admit but who don't have a bed of their own to recuperate in.</p>
<p>Thanks to a variety of social agencies, homeless people and those who live in poverty have more of a voice. These advocates are the reason that homeless people have been put on the high-risk category for H1N1 and will be among the first to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The reasoning is that homeless people, who often have compromised immune systems, congregate in shelters where contagious illnesses are a huge threat. As well, though, the rest of us should be concerned that once sick, these unfortunate people are not able to climb into bed with Tylenol.</p>
<p>They might be able to sit at the New Life Mission for the day, but once night comes, it could be a sleeping bag and the park for them.</p>
<p>Of course, if they get pneumonia, they will be considered sick enough for acute care.</p>
<p>Our health-care system has holes. Although most of us understand that being homeless is a miserable existence, we need to realize that being sick and homeless is life-threatening.</p>
<p>More of us have to join the few people who are advocating for this country's poor, regardless of whether we think they brought on their troubles themselves.</p>
<p>That's just an excuse not to care.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>High demand, low production hamper flu shots; 20% of vaccine expected has been delivered</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>628 words</div><div>1 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>There were calls for patience mixed with signs of frustration yesterday as Canadians across the country spent hours in long lines waiting for their share of an H1N1 vaccine that appears to be in short supply.</p>
<p>People started lining up in the darkness -- some in the rain -- of the early morning hours to be immunized against the flu that has so far claimed 95 lives in this country.</p>
<p>Clinics in Calgary found themselves turning people away for the second consecutive day.</p>
<p>"I am very scared," said taxi driver Resham Sidhu, a father of three young children, after getting turned away from a clinic.</p>
<p>"I drive a cab and I have contact with a lot of people, and then I if catch something, I contact people. Then I come back home and [put my children] at risk, too."</p>
<p>The past week has seen clinics shut down early around the country as demand for the vaccine surged.</p>
<p>Federal officials have painted a gloomy outlook for the week ahead. They have received only one-fifth the amount of vaccine that they had expected to distribute nationwide.</p>
<p>The manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, has fallen behind because it is making a special vaccine for pregnant women, chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said Friday.</p>
<p>Fears about low supply have sparked concerns over the queue-jumpers trying to get the vaccine before Canadians who have been deemed a high risk to contract H1N1.</p>
<p>Several provincial health ministers have pleaded with their residents to let high-risk Canadians -- children under six, pregnant women, seniors, health workers and people with chronic conditions -- get the vaccine first.</p>
<p>Ontario, Nova Scotia, Quebec and Saskatchewan have all said plans to open up clinics to the general public this week have been put on hold so shots can be administered first to at-risk residents.</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador went so far as to tell authorities to put extra security in place at clinics to make sure only the at-risk group receives shots.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said officials learned this past week they will have only 400,000 new doses to ship out this week and another 225,000 doses reserved for pregnant women -- far short of the six million that have been distributed thus far.</p>
<p>The goal, he said, is to have Canadians who want the H1N1 shot immunized by Christmas.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>ISLAND FLU-SHOT CLINICS</p>
<p>Shots are being offered this week, on an honour system, to people in high-risk groups:</p>
<p>- People under 65 with chronic health conditions, such as asthma and diabetes - Pregnant women</p>
<p>- People living in rural and isolated settings, including all First Nations people living on reserves.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Required reading: Five essential stories of the week; Why you can't find a Big Mac in Iceland any more, the end of 'Made in Taiwan,' and how Health Canada's approach to marketing the H1N1 vacine stacks up against the world</b>

</p>
<p>Each week, Report on Business editors choose five stories that shouldn't be missed. Here are the 'must reads' for the week of Oct. 26, 2009.</p>
<p>Don't loathe our lofty loonie</p>
<p>Let's all step back and take a deep breath, writes economist David Rosenberg. For years when the Canadian dollar was trading around 60 cents, exporters did indeed reap the rewards, while importers were hit hard by rising costs. Our exports to the U.S. did improve, but we needed that source of growth as an antidote to the pain from the budget belt-tightening during the 1990s. Of course, there was no shortage of complaints from snowbirds headed south.... While it may be a roadblock for our manufacturing sector, the loonie's ascent is good in many respects. Our purchasing power and standard of living are actually going up. Read the full story</p>
<p>The big whack: Currency collapse drives McDonald's out of Iceland</p>
<p>Icelanders like Jon Ogmundsson have endured many hardships in the last year, including soaring inflation, rising unemployment and a banking crisis so serious the country nearly declared bankruptcy. Now Iceland's battered economy is claiming one more victim – McDonald's. The country's troubled currency, the krona, is to blame. It has lost almost 70 per cent of its value against the euro in the last 18 months, driving up the cost of imports including the beef, cheese and special sauces Mr. Ogmundsson brings in from Germany. Read the full story</p>
<p>Taiwan seeks a new path to economic success</p>
<p>Made in Taiwan. Not so long ago, those three words were nearly as ubiquitous on toys, electronics and other products as “batteries not included.” But as this tiny island of 23 million struggles to get up after getting hammered by the recession, many here fear that the world-famous “Made in Taiwan” brand may be another casualty of the downturn. Taiwan is still a leader in research and development, but outside of laptop computers, little of what it produces reaches consumers directly. Many items that once reached store shelves in North America and Europe branded “Made in Taiwan” now have the final touches put on them in China or Vietnam instead. Read the full story</p>
<p>Auto parts makers target new markets</p>
<p>The automotive meltdown over the past year has delivered a blaring wakeup call to Canada's auto parts makers – the need to diversify. The near failures of General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC sent shock waves through the North American parts industry as plummeting vehicle production battered business for many companies. Eager to insulate themselves from any further deterioration in the sector, parts companies are now hitching their fortunes to broader industrial areas by tapping into everything from solar and wind energy technology to consumer products, aerospace and mining equipment. Read the full story</p>
<p>In the battle against H1N1, these ads are different strains</p>
<p>Most global campaigns – say, for movies, music releases, or software launches – are driven centrally by a single corporation. But the approaches to combatting H1N1 are as varied as the territories themselves. And while the aim of most marketing is to sell a product, ad industry executives admit that changing human behaviour – vital in fighting disease – through conventional advertising presents a far tougher challenge. But while other countries recognize the need to grab a viewing public with entertainment value, Health Canada's tv commercial purely informational and bland, Simon Houpt writes in his Adhocracy column.

<div id="hd"><b>CRUNCH TIME; The last home game of the regular season is huge for the Tiger-Cats; Glenn will need to read Regina's D</b>
</div><div>Drew Edwards  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>863 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>S01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>

<p>Saskatchewan defensive end John Chick says the small device tucked into his equipment injects life-saving insulin but, frankly, that's hard to believe. It's more likely the cell phone-sized pump is jacking him with something more substantial like, say, rocket fuel or liquid nitrogen.</p>
<p>It would help explain how Chick, a diabetic, runs the non-stop motor that has helped him collect 10 sacks this season, good for second in the CFL. Combined with fellow pass-rusher Stevie Baggs, who has 11 quarterback takedowns, the pair can make it tough on offensive linemen like Ticat tackle Dan Goodspeed.</p>
<p>"They have a lot of moves, so film study was crucial this week. Baggs has speed off the edge, while Chick has a great bull rush," he said. "They move them around to different spots so you can't just focus on one."</p>
<p>Ticat quarterback Kevin Glenn said he's using his ability to read defences - and a quick release - to prevent losing yards via the sack. But, as he is fond of saying, the other guys get paid to.</p>
<p>"You try and get rid of the ball quickly, but sometimes defences see that and do things on the back end to try and take it away. That's when your offensive line has to step up and they've done a great job of that the last couple of games," Glenn said.</p>
<p>Hamilton has yielded a grand total of zero sacks the last two weeks against two other strong defences in Montreal and Toronto. Head coach Marcel Bellefeuille said the team has game planned for the Roughriders defensive line duo as well.</p>
<p>"You have to recognize the strengths of the opponents you're playing and that's one of their strengths. I think we've done a good enough job in putting together a plan that will allow us to be successful," Bellefeuille said. "But the reality of football is you're going to be in one-on-ones and if you want to push the ball down the field, you're going to have to hold onto it a little longer, so we're going to have win our fair share of those."</p>
<p>Chick, meanwhile, has been engaged in a one-on-one battle with diabetes since he was diagnosed at 14.</p>
<p>"When I first found out, I had a negative outlook. I just didn't know very much about it and what I did know wasn't good," he said.</p>
<p>Chick spent time educating himself and, after years on insulin injections, moved to a pump "five or six years ago." He says it's taken all kinds of abuse in his role as a football player, but it's held up fine.</p>
<p>"Nothing's ever happened to it. It's very durable. I don't even think about it when I'm out there anymore," Chick said.</p>
<p>In addition to countless hours he puts in as a volunteer in Regina , Chick meets with a group of young diabetics after each road game, something he will do again this afternoon in Hamilton.</p>
<p>"Everyone has dreams as a kid and anytime you have something you have to overcome, it makes you work extra hard. I try to tell kids to focus on what you can do, not what you can't do," Chick said.</p>
<p>NOTES: The Ticats made a couple of roster moves ahead of today's game, taking linebacker Ike Brown and wide receiver Chris Bauman off the 46-man roster and adding receivers Matt Carter and Kevin Robinson, who makes his CFL debut. "He's been very good at returning punts and kicks at the NFL level," Bellefeuille said.... For the Riders, Chris McKenzie will fill in for the injured Eddie Davis at halfback.... The Ticats have been educating their players about H1N1 prevention and have placed hand sanitizer in every room of their training complex. "We're asking all the players to do their part and do our best to not spread this thing or allow it to get inside our walls," Bellefeuille said.... Saskatchewan had several players down with the flu this week.... The temperature for today's game is slated to be around 9 degrees and showers early in the day are expected to have wrapped up. Could be windy though.... The Cats expect a crowd in excess of 20,000.</p>
<p>THE PLAYOFF CHASE</p>
<p>The playoff picture remains remarkably complicated this late in the season. However, one simple formula you can watch for over the next two days is this: If the Edmonton Eskimos lost to Toronto in the late game last night and Hamilton wins this afternoon, the Cats will be in the playoffs for the first time since 2003.</p>

<p>The giant lineups and frustration that dominated the first week of the biggest immunization program in history are expected to get worse next week.</p>
<p>Provinces reported clinic shutdowns yesterday, and federal officials painted a gloomy outlook for the week ahead because they have received only one-fifth the amount of vaccine that they had expected to distribute nationwide.</p>
<p>The manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, has fallen behind because it is making a special vaccine for pregnant women, said chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>Word of the production slowdown came as the World Health Organization reversed its earlier position and said yesterday there is no reason for pregnant women to favour the special version being made exclusively for them.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has switched its one production line back to making the regular vaccine, but it will take some time to ramp up to the target of producing three million doses per week.</p>
<p>Butler Jones said that officials learned Thursday they will have only 400,000 new doses to ship out next week and another 225,000 doses reserved for pregnant women.</p>
<p>He appealed for patience, but it was little comfort in many quarters, where Canadians were turned away by the hundreds as clinics ran out of time and supply yesterday and provinces scrambled to revamp their strategies.</p>
<p>As H1N1 clinics shut their doors early, complaints persisted about the distribution system, confined to only a small number of large venues rather than smaller outlets such as doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Kumanan Wilson, an expert on pandemic preparedness at University of Ottawa, said that there is not enough public information to decipher what has created a bottleneck in the immunization program.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Flu rage' explodes nationally; Mild-mannered Canadians losing their cool</b>
</div><div>MISTY HARRIS    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>421 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>As much as flu fears have people pulling away, H1N1 is also uniting Canadians through emotion - specifically, a deeply entrenched sense of frustration that, for many, has mutated into bitterness, anger and even hostility.</p>
<p>Call it flu rage. Across the country, otherwise mild-mannered Canadians are finding themselves admonishing strangers for open sneezing, losing their cool with queue-jumpers at vaccination clinics, writing angry letters to government and media, and lashing out at friends whose H1N1 opinions differ from their own.</p>
<p>"Anger can cause us to be proactive ... but it can also become destructive, which is what we see with flu rage," says psychologist Gordon Asmundson of the University of Regina.</p>
<p>"It's about a sense of uncertainty combined with the feeling of having no control over a situation. We tend to catastrophize when we're anxious."</p>
<p>Tami Xanthakis, a Montreal proofreader, can't remember the last time that she was so worked up about something as "elementary" as a flu shot.</p>
<p>"What's fuelled my anger is feeling like I'm between a rock and a hard place, not knowing what to do," says Xanthakis. "I feel like the government is pushing us to do this - like, 'Just be quiet and take it.' But I don't know enough to feel secure with the vaccine."</p>
<p>For others, such as Barbara Carlson of Dawson Creek, B.C., it's media "hysteria" and Internet half-truths that make her bristle.</p>
<p>"This is the year 2009, and yet people still believe in superstition and misinformation," says Carlson, a retiree. "Do you know how many</p>
<p>emails I've gotten that told me I could prevent H1N1 by cutting up raw onions and putting them in water around my house? I finally replied, 'Hanging a dead rat around your neck will do just as much good.' The (sender) was quite miffed."</p>
<p>Dan Hoch, principal of an elementary school just outside Calgary, says emotions are running high among parents and teachers alike, primarily because of what he calls the "mind-boggling" deficit in vaccination sites.</p>
<p>"This is a life-and-death scenario. ... People are asking, 'How did the province not get it right?' " Hoch says. "What would it have taken to ask each school to give up their gymnasium for a day and vaccinate all the kids there - literally run them through the same way we do on picture day?</p>
<p>"It could easily have been done."</p>

</p>
<p>Excuse me, doctor, I'm not feeling well. I have the civic chills, a pounding electoral headache and a general feeling of municipal malaise.</p>
<p>I'm indecisive - and sick to my stomach with nausea. In fact, I feel like retching into a brown envelope. I can't even sleep without getting nightmayors.</p>
<p>Tomorrow is election day but it feels more like dejection day. What do you think doctor? Do I have seasonal flu, or swine flu?</p>
<p>Doctor: Neither - it sounds like you've got the latest virus to sweep Montreal. It's called PSF - Political Swine Flu. It's a virulent epidemic that attacks the body politic of Montrealers. It's brought on by repeated exposure to dirty city politics, polluted water contracts and contaminated politicians who cough, then laugh right in your face. It rots away at your whole system, just like flesh-eating disease - only it's cash-eating.</p>
<p>Josh: Ohmigod - it sounds awful! How do I cure it, doctor? Is there a vaccine?</p>
<p>Doctor: Absolutely. We have three new vaccines but each has its own side effects.</p>
<p>The first is Tremblay-axin, a traditional vaccine that's supposed to put you to sleep for four years. But the last batch completely failed to work - and instead created an epidemic. Rather than cleansing city hall, it infected it, causing meglomayor mania, de-construction scandals and an outbreak of "influence-a" peddling.</p>
<p>The makers of Tremblay-axin claim they didn't know about these problems and have rushed out a new batch that will supposedly cure the disease it started. But many people fear it's really just a placebo that will have no affect. As the warning label says: MAY CAUSE ELECTILE DYSFUNCTION.</p>
<p>Josh: That vaccine sounds terrible. What else is available?</p>
<p>Doctor: Well, there's a second vaccine called h2n2 Harelium. This is a much tougher medicine that promises to clean out your entire system. Actually it's more like a colonoscopy, performed with a broom. It supposedly purges you of all grime, slime and crime.</p>
<p>But this vaccine has problems too, An early batch of Harelium also turned out to be contaminated and triggered something called Labonté Syndrome that causes shock and voter paralysis, not to mention Blurry Vision Party.</p>
<p>Josh: Sounds risky too. Are there other possible complications?</p>
<p>Doctor: Yes, Harelium's side effects can be especially powerful on anglos and allos who may experience neverendum referendum anxiety, de-merger re-merger trauma and phantom suburb pain. As well, the vaccine's warnings are only in French, which many English doctors don't fully understand.</p>
<p>We worry Harelium may trigger linguistic schizophrenia, feverish francisization, divided city syndrome and even sublimated sovereignty condition. As the warning label begins: PEUT RENDRE CERTAINS ANGLOS MALADE.</p>
<p>Josh: Geez - that cure may be worse than the disease. Isn't there anything else I can take?</p>
<p>Doctor: Yes - there's a new experimental homeopathic vaccine out called Bergeron Rejuvenated Happy City Green Mountain Megavitamin Therapy. It's completely untested so we have no idea what it does. It's kind of a cross between herbal medicine and a Ouija board.</p>
<p>The group that makes this vaccine claims it's a miracle drug that will cure political swine flu, suburban migration flu, automobile immune flu, icy sidewalk flu and water meter mania flu. And, by the way, would you like some aromatherapy with that?</p>
<p>Josh: What are the side effects?</p>
<p>Doctor: Like the drug's inventor, you could develop a conspiracy theory that the U.S. attacked itself on 9/11. Or tell reporters that smoking is good for exercising. You might start to believe something really paranoid, like the mafia secretly controls construction contracts at Montreal city hall and that's why our roads are so bad - oops, maybe that's not so paranoid.</p>
<p>Long-term use of the Bergeron vaccine may even give you vivid hallucinations that you live in a car-free city where all the cars are gone - and yours is gone too. Hey! - where is my car anyway!? Ohmigod - it's been towed to Abitibi!</p>
<p>The bottom line is we just don't know what this vaccine will do. It's a leap into the unknown. The warning label says: MAY LEAD TO "AUTO"-DESTRUCTIVE BEHAVIOUR.</p>
<p>Josh: I'm sorry, doctor, I really can't decide. It sounds like a choice between cholera, plague and an acid trip. I'm more confused than when I started. Bottom line, doc: What should I do?</p>
<p>Doctor: Don't ask me - you'll have to choose your own medicine. All I can advise you is to wear a mask when you go to the polling station and wash your hands immediately after you handle the ballot, in case it's infected. But Monday morning, no matter what happens, I can safely predict you'll feel sick.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Avalanche can thank goalie Anderson for fast start</b>
</div><div>RED FISHER   </div>

</p>
<p>Has there been a better goaltender thus far this season than Colorado's Craig Anderson?</p>
<p>I don't think so, and you can be sure all the people on and off the ice associated with the Avalanche are certain he's been the best.</p>
<p>The 25 shots Anderson stopped in his team's 3-0 win in Edmonton on Tuesday was his second shutout of the season, while the 30 he made in Calgary the next night in a come-from-behind 3-2 victory lifted the team's record to 10-1-2.</p>
<p>How impressive is that? It's the best 13-game start Colorado has had in franchise history.</p>
<p>The 2000-01 Avalanche, which won both the Presidents Trophy and Stanley Cup, got off to a 9-2-2 start.</p>
<p>Anderson has started every game for Colorado this season, one of the reasons being Peter Budaj has been out with the swine flu. Budaj didn't accompany the team for the start of a four-game road trip, however, he was Anderson's backup for last night's dance with the San Jose Sharks.</p>
<p>Nobody imagined the Avalanche would come out of the starting blocks the way they have after finishing last in the Western Conference last season.</p>
<p>And what makes Anderson's work shine even brighter is that by the time Colorado concludes its current road trip, it will have played 11 of its first 15 games on the road.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'is there a reason for panic?'; We're not at fatal risk, experts say. The vast majority who are healthy shouldn't worry, physician emphasizes</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>925 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The signs aren't hard to miss: Montreal schools sending children home with flu-like symptoms, and parents swarming hospital emergency rooms with their little ones sniffling in tow.</p>
<p>As Quebec's H1N1 vaccination campaign got off to a shaky start this week, panic and anxiety have been spreading like the swine flu virus itself. Much of the fear has been fanned by the news that a 13-year-old Ontario boy who excelled at playing hockey died on Monday from H1N1.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio began feeling ill last weekend, running a fever and vomiting. He appeared to be getting better on Monday, but then his body went limp as he took a bath.</p>
<p>Evan's case is as puzzling as it is tragic because he appeared to be otherwise healthy, with no underlying medical problems.</p>
<p>But infectious-disease experts who have been following the H1N1 pandemic say that people shouldn't jump to the conclusion that every child, teen and adult is at fatal risk.</p>
<p>"Is there a reason for panic?" asked Karl Weiss, a physician and microbiologist at Maisonneuve Rosemont Hospital.</p>
<p>"The answer is no. Obviously, because of what happened in Ontario people started panicking. However, for the vast majority of people who are healthy and who have no underlying medical condition, I don't think they should worry." Weiss couldn't comment on the specifics of the boy's death, but he said that in extremely rare cases healthy individuals might be "genetically predisposed to have an intense reaction to H1N1." Still, he added that "when you have healthy kids, the chances of seeing something bad are really small." There's no doubt that H1N1 has acted much differently than typical flu viruses. It first struck in May, not during the regular fall-to-winter flu season. And it has sickened and killed a much greater proportion of children, teens and young adults than the typical flu, which tends to prey upon the elderly.</p>
<p>It's for those reasons that governments around the world have launched massive vaccination campaigns. However, the evidence thus far suggests that this pandemic won't be anywhere nearly as lethal as the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed about 50 million people.</p>
<p>To date, with the second wave of the pandemic under way, the World Health Organization has reported a total of 5,700 deaths from H1N1 out of 440,000 laboratory-confirmed cases. The actual number of cases is probably much higher because "many countries have stopped counting individual cases, particularly of milder illness." Therefore, the death rate from H1N1 is likely lower than 1.2 per cent. In a typical flu season, the death rate is one-tenth of one per cent.</p>
<p>However, public-health experts are noting that many more people are coming down with the flu this year. In a regular flu season, about 10 per cent of the population gets sick.</p>
<p>In its latest update yesterday, the WHO observed that "influenza transmission continues to intensify, marking an unusually early start to ... influenza season in some countries." Brian Ward, an infectious-diseases expert at the McGill University Health Centre, said that up to 25 per cent of the Canadian population could contract H1N1.</p>
<p>However, he predicted that probably fewer Canadians will die from H1N1 than in a typical flu season in which there are up to 2,000 deaths. The caveat, he added, is that more younger Canadians will likely die this year from H1N1 - all the more reason to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Ward estimated that of those who fall ill from H1N1, one in 1,000 end up in the intensive-care unit, and of those in the ICU, 25 per cent die. Extrapolating from those numbers, the Canadian death toll might reach 825. So far, 89 Canadians have died from H1N1.</p>
<p>Studies have shown that most people who have developed complications from H1N1 suffer from underlying health problems like chronic lung disease, asthma, hypertension, obesity and diabetes.</p>
<p>Despite the prevailing anxiety, Ward expressed optimism that Canada's second wave of H1N1 infections might be shorter than expected.</p>
<p>"As the vaccine is released into the community, I'm very hopeful that we will see a truncated wave," he said.</p>
<p>"In the Southern Hemisphere, what they saw was an eight- to nine-week wave. If we can vaccinate a significant proportion of the Canadian population, we can reasonably hope that our second wave will be shorter than theirs."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>School boards look to Quebec to cover H1N1-related costs</b>
</div><div>BRENDA BRANSWELL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>348 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Face masks, hand sanitizers, and cleaning supplies are some of the H1N1-related costs racked up by Quebec school boards.</p>
<p>The Lester B. Pearson School Board estimates it has spent about $75,000 so far - and it wants the Quebec government to foot the bill.</p>
<p>A resolution passed unanimously by the Pearson board this week called on Quebec to cover all expenses for preparing, implementing and operating H1N1 pandemic plans through special grants.</p>
<p>The board's H1N1 expenses partly stem from ramping up cleaning and disinfecting, said chairperson Marcus Tabachnick. Costs are also starting to accumulate for staff who are off on preventive leave or who may have to be replaced, he said. (About 20 to 25 of the board's teachers are off on preventive medical leave because of pregnancy.)</p>
<p>The government has asked school boards to keep track of their expenses related to H1N1, said Cédrick Beauregard, a spokesperson for Education Minister Michelle Courchesne. He wouldn't venture further when asked if Quebec will pick up the tab.</p>
<p>"We want a commitment from the government that they're going to undertake to cover the costs," Tabachnick said.</p>
<p>"They shouldn't expect that to come out of the operating costs of those school boards."</p>
<p>Josée Bouchard, the head of the Fédération des commissions scolaires du Québec, said it hopes all the expenses are reimbursed.</p>
<p>The English Montreal School Board says it has spent about $92,000 on H1N1-related expenses since last spring. It also plans to ask Quebec to cover the costs. The board has a stockpile of such items as cleaning products, cleaning cloths and germicide.</p>
<p>The $92,000 tally includes $10,000 for H1N1 workshops for administrators given by Hour-Zero Crisis Consulting Ltd., which helped the board with its emergency preparedness program, said board spokesperson Michael Cohen.</p>
<p>The Commission scolaire de Montréal, the province's largest school board, says it incurred $18,334 in H1N1-related expenses between April 30 and Sept. 30.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>I work in a local pharmacy where we fill prescriptions for members of the public who are diagnosed with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>I understand that if you have been diagnosed with H1N1, you need this medication. But it would help if you sent another family member or neighbour who isn't infected. You can even have your medication delivered, which would help to reduce the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>As well, when a doctor quarantines you for 48 hours, that means stay at home. If you must come into the store, please use the hand sanitizer that is available.</p>
<p>Please don't pick up merchandise while you're waiting for your prescription to be filled -- you are contagious and we want to minimize the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>We not only want to protect our other customers, we also want to protect ourselves.</p>
<p>I find it difficult to understand that people can't or won't follow simple instructions.</p>
<p>Maybe we need the public health department to put notes on doors and make sure infected people stay home, like they used to do long ago.</p>

<p>Inuit artists share their love of the land</p>
<p>Three generations of Cape Dorset artists are featured in an exhibition organized by the McMichael Canadian Art Collection to mark the 50th anniversary of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative.</p>
<p>Almost 90 prints, drawings and sculptures -- many of them on loan from the co-operative -- are on display in Kleinburg.</p>
<p>Well-known artists represented include Pitseolak Ashoona, Kenojuak Ashevak, Kananginak Pootoogook and Pudlo Pudlat.</p>
<p>"Remaining in close relationship with the natural environment, (these artists) recreate a powerful story of a people belonging to the land rather than owning it," the gallery says.</p>
<p>Nunannguaq: In the Likeness of the Earth, runs until Jan. 17.</p>
<p>Cape Dorset, a centre for Inuit drawing, printmaking and carving, is located on Dorset Island off the southwest tip of Baffin Island in Nunavut.</p>
<p>On the web: mcmichael.com</p>
<p>Postpone travel if ill</p>
<p>OTTAWA Health officials say people who are feeling ill should postpone travel plans and they say travel staff -- from bus drivers to air cabin crews -- should watch out for ill passengers.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq says the government is encouraging travel companies to make it easier for people to rebook flights and buses if they have to cancel because of sickness.</p>
<p>Her officials are also sending guidelines to travel companies to help them cope with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>These guidelines suggest regular cleaning of public areas in stations and vehicles and urge companies to provide handwashing facilities for passengers and crews.</p>
<p>Health officials continue to encourage people to get flu shots.</p>
<p>The minister says six million doses of vaccine will have been shipped by the end of this week, with millions on the way.</p>
<p>Tourism done right</p>
<p>Two of the top three places in National Geographic Traveler's annual "destination stewardship" survey are Canadian: B.C.'s Kootenay/Yoho national parks, ranked No. 2, and Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula, in third place.</p>
<p>They trail only Norway's fiords region, ranked No. 1.</p>

<p>Inuit artists share their love of the land</p>
<p>Three generations of Cape Dorset artists are featured in an exhibition organized by the McMichael Canadian Art Collection to mark the 50th anniversary of the West Baffin Eskimo Co-operative.</p>
<p>Almost 90 prints, drawings and sculptures -- many of them on loan from the co-operative -- are on display in Kleinburg.</p>
<p>Well-known artists represented include Pitseolak Ashoona, Kenojuak Ashevak, Kananginak Pootoogook and Pudlo Pudlat.</p>
<p>"Remaining in close relationship with the natural environment, (these artists) recreate a powerful story of a people belonging to the land rather than owning it," the gallery says.</p>
<p>Nunannguaq: In the Likeness of the Earth, runs until Jan. 17.</p>
<p>Cape Dorset, a centre for Inuit drawing, printmaking and carving, is located on Dorset Island off the southwest tip of Baffin Island in Nunavut.</p>

<p>Postpone travel if ill</p>
<p>OTTAWA Health officials say people who are feeling ill should postpone travel plans and they say travel staff -- from bus drivers to air cabin crews -- should watch out for ill passengers.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq says the government is encouraging travel companies to make it easier for people to rebook flights and buses if they have to cancel because of sickness.</p>
<p>Her officials are also sending guidelines to travel companies to help them cope with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>These guidelines suggest regular cleaning of public areas in stations and vehicles and urge companies to provide handwashing facilities for passengers and crews.</p>
<p>Health officials continue to encourage people to get flu shots.</p>
<p>The minister says six million doses of vaccine will have been shipped by the end of this week, with millions on the way.</p>
<p>Tourism done right</p>
<p>Two of the top three places in National Geographic Traveler's annual "destination stewardship" survey are Canadian: B.C.'s Kootenay/Yoho national parks, ranked No. 2, and Quebec's Gaspé Peninsula, in third place.</p>
<p>They trail only Norway's fiords region, ranked No. 1.</p>
<p>Experts were asked to rank 133 destinations around the world based on factors including pollution, cultural authenticity, aesthetic appeal, quality of tourism management and outlook for the future.</p>

</div><div>The Canadian Press</div>

<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>Olympic silver medallist Jeff Pain wedged a swine flu vaccination into his hectic life yesterday out of concern for his wife and sons.</p>
<p>The skeleton slider from Calgary wants to avoid contracting H1N1 in these final weeks before the 2010 Olympics, but more important was the health of his family while he's away for almost two months of training and international races.</p>
<p>Sons Thomas, 6, and Kyle, 8, have asthma, which puts them in a high-risk category for contracting swine flu. Pain says his wife, Alyson, would be stretched to the limit should one of their children become ill during his absence.</p>
<p>"The harsh reality of our situation is Aly doesn't have time in the winter to deal with a kid who is in the hospital or sick for two or three days because I'm not around," he said. "It puts an incredible amount of strain on her, so we do everything we can to make sure we can stay healthy."</p>
<p>If Canada's Olympic athletes want the H1N1 vaccine, they'll stand in line for hours with everybody else, even though the Canadian Olympic Committee's chief medical officer says they are a high-risk group and should be at the front of the queue for swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>"Let's just say we haven't achieved our goals of getting the team immunized," Bob McCormack said yesterday from Toronto. We still are working to make sure they don't miss the vaccination opportunity altogether because they leave Canada for competitions in Europe and Asia and are gone for a few months."</p>
<p>Pain's wife headed for a southwest Calgary clinic yesterday at 7 a.m. to save a spot in line for the family. Pain and their sons arrived two hours later and the family was vaccinated around 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Pain departs Tuesday for Ottawa, where the skeleton team will undergo wind-tunnel testing at the National Research Council, before heading to Europe for the start of the World Cup season.</p>
<p>"Do I have four hours to spend in line right now? I don't," Pain said. "I'm in a massive time crunch because I leave Tuesday and I'm back at Christmas.</p>
<p>"I have to have everything set up for my family that I would normally do, the accounting, changing the car tires and all that life stuff. I've got to get that done, all my equipment ready and get myself ready. I don't have time to do it, but time becomes irrelevant when you're dealing with kids."</p>
<p>Many of Canada's athletes have either left or are leaving this month to begin their seasons. They'll travel extensively over the next few weeks. They are in the age range susceptible to contracting strong cases of swine flu, McCormack says, and because they train to exhaustion, their immune systems are suppressed.</p>
<p>Pain says athletes are most in danger of contracting swine flu in airplanes and airports.</p>
<p>"If we want to try and stop the spread of this around the world, anyone who travels should be at the front of the line," he said.</p>
<p>Vancouver region health officials have urged all athletes attending the Olympics to get the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

</div><div>Johanna Weidner  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>908 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO</p>
<p>Leanne and Paul Hergott knew their only daughter Sarah was fragile and would require constant care for her whole life.</p>
<p>But the Bloomingdale couple never thought Sarah would die suddenly of a common virus when she was just 12.</p>
<p>Less than a week after waking up with a fever, Sarah took her last breath Thursday in her mother's arms.</p>
<p>At the emergency department the day after she became sick, the Hergotts were told their daughter had the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"They diagnosed her right away with H1N1, it was so severe," Leanne said.</p>
<p>The Hergotts can't believe how quickly their daughter became seriously ill.</p>
<p>"It's just very scary, that it can hit so hard and fast," Leanne said.</p>
<p>Sarah had Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder causing mental and physical disabilities and often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy or autism. She suffered from seizures, eating and sleep disorders, and difficulty walking. She only spoke a few words - her favourites, momma and dadda.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, Sarah developed pneumonia and suffered a massive seizure. She was on life-support for a week and never fully recovered, with colds routinely turning into pneumonia.</p>
<p>"We knew that she was medically fragile and was at a higher risk for H1N1 to be fatal," Leanne said.</p>
<p>But they also knew she had gotten through many illnesses before.</p>
<p>Regional medical officer of health Dr. Liana Nolan could not say if Sarah died of H1N1.</p>
<p>"We've had no confirmed deaths due to H1N1," Nolan said.</p>
<p>However, only cases confirmed by laboratory testing are reported to public health.</p>
<p>"It's possible that there are deaths that don't get reported to us because that test was not done," Nolan said.</p>
<p>Sarah did not have the nose swab used to test for the virus, her parents said. She didn't get the H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>"It wasn't available until this week and she was sick on Saturday," Leanne said.</p>
<p>The couple aren't sure how they're going to move on without the girl who was at the centre of their lives since she was born.</p>
<p>"It has definitely ruined us. We're going to have to learn how to live a completely different life," Leanne said. "She fulfilled us. She made us a family."</p>
<p>They're urging everyone in the community to take the H1N1 flu virus seriously and take every precaution, from getting vaccinated to washing hands regularly and staying home when sick.</p>
<p>"Do what you can to protect yourself and your family," Leanne said.</p>
<p>Both Leanne and Paul got flu-like symptoms after Sarah.</p>
<p>"We were sick two days and we snapped out of it," Leanne said. "Our daughter didn't have a chance."</p>
<p>Sarah went to school last Friday at Rosemount Public School in Kitchener for very high needs students. After school was the usual routine: Sarah had a snack, then curled up with her mother on the couch under a blanket to watch cartoons.</p>
<p>She woke up Saturday morning with a fever and was inconsolable. The fever continued, and her parents took her to Grand River Hospital Sunday morning. The hospital couldn't comment on the case last night.</p>
<p>By Sunday afternoon, her lungs had become so clogged that oxygen therapy wasn't working. Hospital staff weren't sure a ventilator would help. But the Hergotts had decided after the last time they would never put their daughter on life-support again.</p>
<p>"We said the rest of her life is going to be a life," Leanne said.</p>
<p>Their choices were to keep Sarah in hospital hooked up to an intravenous, or bring her home where they had an oxygen tank and she would be comfortable. She wasn't expected to last a week.</p>
<p>"We said we want her to be peaceful because she loves her family and she loves everything in this house," Leanne said.</p>
<p>They brought her home Sunday evening, gave her a bath and tucked her into bed. The fever continued into Monday, when she was started on an antiviral drug.</p>
<p>Sarah was sick but alert.</p>
<p>"By Tuesday, we couldn't get her out of the bed," Leanne said.</p>
<p>She continued to worsen as the hours passed. Thursday afternoon, Sarah started gasping for breath.</p>
<p>Leanne was lying with her in bed, holding her precious daughter in her arms when Sarah took her last breath.</p>
<p>"When it was all over, I wouldn't let her go for an hour and a half," Leanne said. "It was peaceful to stop hearing that horrible breathing, but it wasn't peaceful to see your daughter take her last breath."</p>
<p>Sarah was expected to have a normal life expectancy despite her disabilities.</p>
<p>"Our biggest worry was what was going to happen to her when we were gone," Paul said.</p>
<p>H1N1 primarily affects children, teenagers and young adults, but for most the virus is mild and does not require medical care.</p>
<p>Almost nine out of 10 deaths are in people with underlying medical conditions, Nolan said. Every year in Ontario, an estimated 11 children aged five to 14 die of seasonal flu.</p>

</p>
<p>Booby-trapped treats could be the least of parents' worries this Halloween.</p>
<p>Some moms and dads may question the wisdom of allowing their kids to mingle at Halloween parties or go door-to-door when the flu virus is already getting around quite effectively on its own.</p>
<p>Germy doorbells and communal candy bowls seem like ideal vehicles for helping it along.</p>
<p>But Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief medical officer of health, says common sense and a few extra precautions are the best way to scare away the HallowH1N1 monster.</p>
<p>Here's some advice:</p>
<p>* When kids come to the door, don't let them fish around in the candy bowl for their goodies, drop treats in the kids' bags individually.</p>
<p>* Wash store-bought masks before allowing kids to wear them. You never know who has tried them on ... or what germs they had.</p>
<p>* Homeowners should wipe down their doorbell, knocker or knobs throughout the evening; kids should wear gloves with their costumes, use hand sanitizer between homes and keep their hands away from their faces.</p>
<p>* Sick children should stay home no matter how much they beg; sick parents shouldn't hand out treats.</p>
<p>* Don't eat any candy that isn't wrapped, for more reasons than H1N1.</p>
<p>* No bobbing for apples, if anybody actually does that anymore.</p>
<p>* And no "a bite for you, a bite for me" sharing of candies.</p>
<p>* When they get home, kids should decide what they want to eat, unwrap it without touching the edible part, wash their hands and then dig in.</p>
<p>* Wash hands.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Naturopaths shun vaccine, say fever is good</b>
</div><div>Susan Clairmont  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>761 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A09</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>There's the scientific way to deal with H1N1.</p>
<p>And then there's the naturopathic way.</p>
<p>A daily dose of good old cod liver oil. Fungi that will keep the flu at bay. Eliminate sugar from your diet. Cook up a big pot of chicken soup.</p>
<p>And whatever you do -- say some naturopaths, controversially -- don't get the H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>"I do not recommend the vaccine," says Laura Margaritis, a Hamilton naturopath who has been swamped with queries by old and new patients leery of getting the flu shot. "This whole thing is a great big hype. It's a very mild infection in almost everyone."</p>
<p>A poll released last weekend by the Globe and Mail and CTV found that 51 per cent of Canadians are not planning to get the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Indeed, Margaritis is skeptical that all the illness out there right now is actually the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Doctors are not testing every patient for H1N1. So there is no way of knowing, she says, if this is really the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>But the government has already spent time and money preparing the vaccine, so it's not going to back off now, she adds.</p>
<p>Before we get any farther into this, let's just make it clear. Most doctors think Margaritis's approach is bunk. Useless at best. Dangerous at worst.</p>
<p>"Vaccine is proven by science," says Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health. "And this -- the naturopath way -- is not."</p>
<p>In case you've been living under a rock these past few weeks, Mackie and every other public health official in the country is telling us to get our H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Yet there are many who are afraid. Or defiant. And those folks are showing up at Margaritis's door in droves.</p>
<p>"I've been treating cases since the end of August," she says. "As well as people who don't want the vaccine or aren't sure that they should get it. Many of those are young mothers getting pressure from their parents and their doctors to get the vaccination."</p>
<p>The flu has been around for thousands of years, she says.</p>
<p>Vaccinations have only been used relatively recently.</p>
<p>The body, if left alone, has the capacity to fight off a flu bug and be stronger and healthier for the trouble.</p>
<p>"Get the illness and go through it and teach the body how to deal with it," she says.</p>
<p>She zones in on fevers in particular. The worse thing you can do if you get the flu, she says, is take Tylenol or some other fever suppressant.</p>
<p>"Fever is a wonderful thing," she says, "because it means your body is fighting the flu. But today, we're so afraid of fever. Suppressing the fever drives the infection into our lungs."</p>
<p>Margaritis -- citing "the media" as her source -- says taking Tylenol led to the death of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio last weekend. The Mississauga teen collapsed and died a day after visiting a walk-in clinic to have his flu symptoms checked out. The clinic reportedly advised Evan to take Tylenol.</p>
<p>Margaritis claims it was the Tylenol that suppressed his fever and led to his death.</p>
<p>"The hockey player was given Tylenol so he could get out on the ice," she says.</p>
<p>When her own 2-year-old son had H1N1 in September, Margaritis says she allowed the fever to run its course. She let it get up to 106 F "because I'm a naturopath and I know what I'm doing" before "breaking it" with belladonna, a perennial plant used in a homeopathic remedy for fever.</p>
<p>Mackie gives different advice.</p>
<p>Allowing a fever higher than 102 F to go unchecked can cause febrile seizures, particularly in children.</p>
<p>"It's not necessarily dangerous at all," says Mackie, "just really scary."</p>
<p>He recommends knocking the fever down with Tylenol.</p>
<p>Margaritis, and many local health food stores, offer advice to stave off H1N1:</p>
<p>* Take cod liver oil daily as a source of vitamin A and D.</p>
<p>* Eat chicken soup.</p>
<p>* Avoid sugar because it impacts negatively on the immune system.</p>
<p>* Gargle with sea salt water every hour.</p>
<p>* Take oscilloccinum, a homeopathic flu remedy derived from duck livers.</p>
<p>* Take red reishi mushrooms to strengthen the immune system.</p>
