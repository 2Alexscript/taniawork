</p>
<p>Ever since the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) raised its benchmark interest rate by a quarter-percentage point to 3.25 per cent on Oct. 7, investors have been gaga over the Land Down Under.</p>
<p>In a world of minuscule and moribund interest rates, the Aussies are the only industrialized market where rates are rising – a tasty morsel for an investing world starving for better rates of return.</p>
<p>The question is, how can a little investor in Canada (where our own central bank's benchmark rate is a puny 0.25 per cent and going nowhere) take a bite out of the juicy Aussie largesse? Here are a few possibilities:</p>
<p>Open a savings account at an Australian bank, though most personal accounts carry residency requirements. And there's a 10-per-cent non-residency tax on interest earnings that will make a serious dent in your returns. Buy Australian dollars, which will likely remain market darlings as long as the RBA is raising rates while other central banks sit on their hands. But simply holding the Aussie buck won't pay you interest.</p>
<p>Buy Australian government bonds (easy to do through a full-service broker). But beware steep service fees for foreign transactions.</p>
<p>Buy Australian-dollar futures contracts. This will give you the benefit of both the rising Aussie interest rates and the rising currency – and you can do it via the Internet.</p>
<p>Futures contracts have interest rates built into their prices.</p>
<p>A contract to take delivery on the Australian currency in March, 2010, for example, is priced about two percentage points below the current exchange rate, to compensate for the interest you forgo by agreeing to take delivery on the currency next March rather than now.</p>
<p>You earn the interest payment up front – you're essentially paying only 98 Australian dollars to buy 100.</p>
<p>This option does expose you to currency risk, but that would be a bonus if the Australian dollar goes up.</p>
<p>You not only make money on the rate differential, but cash in on foreign-exchange gains.</p>

<p>Swine flu and the bottom line</p>
<p>Concerns about the H1N1 flu virus are bolstering the bottom lines of several companies as demand rises for products such as masks, soap and vaccines. Here's a look at some companies and products that are benefiting:</p>
<p>Kimberly-Clark : The maker of Kleenex and Huggies diapers said about 40 per cent of its gain in health-care volumes in the last quarter “was attributable to increased global demand for face masks as a result of the H1N1 flu virus.” That gain helped boost its third-quarter profit by 41 per cent.</p>
<p>3M : The U.S. manufacturer said demand is rising for its respiratory masks. It estimates demand related to swine flu fears added between $80-million and $100-million (U.S.) to third-quarter sales.</p>
<p>Alpha Pro Tech Ltd. : The company has ramped up mask production and said mask sales would rise significantly in its third quarter.</p>
<p>Merck : The drug maker said demand is growing for its vaccine, Pneumovax, which protects against strains of disease that can cause pneumonia, a common flu complication. Sales are up about 80 per cent from a year ago. Rivals Novartis AG and Roche Holding AG, which make flu vaccinations, are also seeing higher sales.</p>
<p>Clorox Co. : At the U.S. home and laundry business, Clorox bleach and wipes account for about 30 per cent of sales. It reports earnings on Nov. 2.</p>
<p>Purell: Ohio-based Gojo Industries invented Purell, the top-selling hand sanitizer. The private company still makes Purell, and Johnson & Johnson distributes it. This summer, overall hand sanitizer sales jumped 19 per cent from a year earlier, according to Chicago-based Information Resources Inc.</p>
<p>Ecolab Inc. : Hand sanitizer maker Ecolab has “seen a significant increase in orders” for the gel in the third quarter and expects the trend to remain strong through the flu season, spokesman Michael Monahan said this month.</p>

<p>Is that a real AK-47?</p>
<p>The Russian maker of the Kalashnikov rifle, or AK-47, says it will move to protect the patent of the widely copied gun. The Kalashnikov has become the world's most popular weapon, with some 100 million made over 60 years, but only about half are the genuine article. The company says it loses as much as $500-million (U.S.) a year to copies.</p>
<p>The real Kalashnikovs</p>
<p>The Russian company Izhmash makes the rifle in the Ural Mountains city of Izhevsk. Venezuela, which struck a deal to buy 100,000 rifles and produce more under licence, is the only fully legitimate licence holder.</p>
<p>The counterfeits</p>
<p>About 30 foreign manufacturers make Kalashnikovs. The former Soviet Union paid little attention to copyright laws, easily handing out arms production licences to its satellites in Eastern Europe and elsewhere. The Cold War-era licences have long-since expired, but production has continued.</p>
<p>The Chinese market</p>
<p>The Soviet Union provided China with weapons technology until the two Communist giants turned into bitter rivals in the 1960s. Moscow and Beijing rebuilt their ties in the early 1990s, and China again became a top customer for Russian weapons, purchasing billions of dollars worth of fighter jets, missiles, destroyers and submarines. But China, traditionally a top customer for Russian weapons, has reduced its purchases in recent years and started producing unlicensed copies of some armaments, including the Su-27 fighter jet, signalling that Russia might find it hard to defend its copyright.</p>

<p>Only one Quebecer in three is eager to get vaccinated against the H1N1 swine flu virus, according to a recent survey. If these figures are correct, governments have serious work to do.</p>
<p>The vaccine is the best way, perhaps the only way, you can protect yourself - and everyone else - from this dangerous disease. Vaccine-avoidance is both unwise and dangerous.</p>
<p>So far, the swine flu has killed 4,735 people around the world, and infected hundreds of thousands more people in 191 countries. Most victims do recover on their own, without medical intervention, as with an ordinary flu.</p>
<p>But for a minority of the people who catch this bug, it's a much scarier scenario. In some patients, the virus mounts a fierce attack on the respiratory tract. These patients need hospital treatment and have to be hooked up to mechanical ventilation for several days.</p>
<p>Studies in the United States have found that the number of patients requiring mechanical ventilation is increasing "six times faster than the rest of hospitalizations," a University of Massachusetts scientist told Bloomberg.com. Health officials worldwide fear that most countries don't have nearly enough equipment to handle a surge in such serious H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>That's why those officials are all but unanimous: The vaccine against H1N1 cannot be delivered fast enough, especially to those at higher risk, including children, pregnant women, heart patients, the obese, and younger people.</p>
<p>As many as half of unexpected flu deaths are among patients with pre-existing heart disease, according to a recent study published in the Lancet. Those researchers urged everyone with heart disease to be sure to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Despite all this, a surprising number of people around the world irrationally fear the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Getting the vaccine is voluntary, but as you can see there are powerful reasons to get the shot. As with any epidemic, transmission of this flu could be quick and unpredictable. If the malady gets into the whole population, our medical institutions could easily be overwhelmed. The disruptions to schools and businesses, public services, and daily life could be severe even for the healthy.</p>
<p>"I never get the flu" is no reason to ignore this menace. That statement means only "I haven't had the flu yet." There are no guarantees against H1N1.</p>
<p>Vaccination will be available, free of charge, to all in Quebec, starting as early as next week.</p>
<p>If you still have doubts about the vaccine, discuss the question with your family physician or someone at your neighbourhood clinic.</p>

<p>Concerns over swine flu are bolstering the bottom lines of several companies as demand rises for products such as masks, shots and soap.</p>
<p>On Thursday alone, Kimberly Clark Corp., Merck & Co. and 3M Co. mentioned swine flu as a factor in higher sales.</p>

</p>
<p>Ontarians in high-risk groups will get the H1N1 vaccine starting Monday as part of Canada's largest-ever immunization campaign, after the federal government approved the vaccine Wednesday.</p>
<p>Some 722,000 doses have been shipped to public health units around Ontario, and they will be distributed within days to family physicians as well as health-care facilities.</p>
<p>The identified high-risk groups include adults under the age of 65 with chronic conditions, health-care workers, caregivers for high-risk groups, people living in remote and isolated communities, pregnant women and healthy children six months to five years of age, Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said in an interview in Toronto.</p>
<p>King said the vaccine "is our most effective weapon in fighting H1N1. We are ready, we are prepared, and we are going to win this battle one shot at a time."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, in announcing approval of the vaccine in Ottawa, said, "I encourage all Canadians to get vaccinated because it is the best way to protect our health and the health of our loved ones."</p>
<p>Two million doses of the vaccine had already been shipped to the provinces and territories, awaiting Aglukkaq's go-ahead. Other countries have already begun vaccinations.</p>
<p>Local health authorities will ask people at lower risk to wait until people at higher risk get the shots. But Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, acknowledged the vaccinations are "not a rationing exercise" and no one will be turned away.</p>
<p>"We're not going to spend a lot of time trying to go through people's medical history. We want to get as many people immunized as possible," he said. "I think Canadians have shown, time and time again, their respect for the most vulnerable."</p>
<p>Ottawa has agreed to shield drug companies from lawsuits over the H1N1 pandemic vaccine. That means the federal government, not the vaccine manufacturers, would have to pay any damages awarded in court, except in cases of malpractice.</p>
<p>Canadian clinical trials of the vaccine are still underway, but the federal regulator was satisfied enough with the results of thousands of clinical trials in Europe to approve the drug in Canada.</p>
<p>"This authorization was arrived at independently and on the basis of sound health science," said Dr. Elwyn Griffiths, head of the section of Health Canada that regulates vaccines. "This vaccine is both safe and effective."</p>
<p>Roll-out dates will vary across the country. The federal government aims to ship about three million doses a week as the vaccine rolls off the production line.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has a contract to produce 50.4 million doses of pandemic vaccine at its facility in Ste-Foy, Que.</p>
<p>In Ontario, those outside the high-risk groups may have to wait until mid-November or December to get the vaccine, depending on how quickly Ottawa replenishes Ontario's stocks, King said.</p>
<p>Some pregnant women, who were supposed to be at the front of the line for the vaccine, may also have to wait. The H1N1 shot intended for pregnant women is not expected to be available for at least two more weeks, King said.</p>
<p>Expectant mothers more than 20 weeks into their pregnancy, or who have underlying medical conditions such as asthma and diabetes, should therefore talk to their doctor about getting the vaccine that's already arrived, she said.</p>
<p>Healthy women in the first half of their pregnancy should wait for the flu shot that doesn't contain an adjuvant - a natural additive that boosts the impact of a vaccine - because there's less risk they'll develop complications from the flu, King said.</p>
<p>The unadjuvanted vaccine won't be available until early November, and even then, it takes 10 to 14 days to take effect, she said. "I don't know how much more flu activity we will have at that time, but it could be significant," she said. "And I think on balance this is the best recommendation I can make."</p>
<p>Have you got H1N1?</p>
<p>Having fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue, particularly fever and cough, likely means you have H1N1.</p>
<p>How to treat it</p>
<p>Stay home from school or work, but it's safe to return when you're 24 hours without fever.</p>
<p>High-risk candidates should contact their doctors for antiviral medication. Seek immediate medical help if you have shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or chest pain.</p>
<p>Self-care is key: drink plenty of fluids, avoid caffeine, use basic pain or fever meds, gargle with warm water.</p>
<p>Some facts about the vaccine for the H1N1 flu, approved Wednesday for national distribution.</p>
<p>What is it:</p>
<p>A vaccine developed by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> in Ste-Foy, a district of Quebec City.</p>
<p>When available:</p>
<p>Provinces may begin administering their stockpiles of vaccine as early as next week. About two million doses shipped to provinces and territories, with between two million and 3.5 million more doses to be shipped each week. <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has contracted to provide 50.4 million doses.</p>
<p>Additives:</p>
<p>The current vaccine contains an adjuvant, a compound that boosts the immune response to the vaccine and stretches supplies by using smaller doses per person. There's currently no licensed seasonal flu vaccine containing adjuvant in Canada, although adjuvants have been used for years in Europe in flu vaccines targeted at seniors.</p>
<p>Unadjuvanted vaccines:</p>
<p>No data on the use of adjuvanted flu vaccines in either pregnant women or young children. The government has ordered 1.8 million doses of unadjuvanted vaccines for their use. The unadjuvanted products will be shipped separately from the ordinary vaccines; no word yet on when they will be available.</p>
<p>Pandemic vaccine and seasonal flu shot:</p>
<p>An unpublished Canadian study suggests getting a seasonal flu shot may double a person's risk of catching H1N1. Data from several other countries doesn't show the same association, and the World Health Organization isn't suggesting countries change their vaccination plans because of the study.</p>
<p>Who should get vaccinated:</p>
<p>Everyone 10 years of age or older should receive one dose of adjuvanted vaccine. Children between six months and 10 years should received the adjuvanted vaccine in two half-doses, administered at least 21 days apart. Pregnant women are advised to get one dose of unadjuvanted vaccine, though if they are 20 weeks or more into their pregnancy and the unadjuvanted vaccine isn't available, they are advised to get the adjuvanted shot. Infants less than six months old aren't vaccinated for influenza.</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Too sick to get out of bed? You can probably stop wondering why.</p>
<p>Chances are it is H1N1.</p>
<p>Although the common cold and regular seasonal flu are also circulating in Waterloo Region, the H1N1 virus already has a solid foothold and is picking up steam here.</p>
<p>"We have increasing cases of flu that are likely, almost all of them, H1N1," said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, the region's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"Right now is a really good time for people to be vigilant because it is going around," said Wang.</p>
<p>There have been 16 confirmed cases of H1N1 since the beginning of September. Schools are reporting absentee rates of 10 to 20 per cent and lineups are forming for family doctors.</p>
<p>Next week, a new vaccine will be distributed to local hospitals, walk-in clinics and doctors.</p>
<p>Those doses are meant for people at greatest risk of complications from H1N1.</p>
<p>They include pregnant women, children under 5, those with chronic medical conditions, health-care workers, and caregivers for infants under six months old - who can't be immunized - and people with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>The following week, starting Nov. 3, the public health department will begin holding general H1N1 immunization clinics throughout the region.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Wang said the best precautions are the same ones urged every flu season - frequent handwashing, coughing into a tissue or sleeve, and staying home from work or school if you're ill.</p>
<p>But while care is a key to limiting its spread, health officials are hoping residents also keep the H1N1 pandemic in perspective so hospital emergency departments and doctors' offices aren't needlessly clogged.</p>
<p>The new strain is making headlines because it spread so quickly around the world and hits more young people, but Wang said its symptoms are generally no worse than seasonal flu and H1N1 actually has a much lower mortality rate.</p>
<p>As a result, she said, people shouldn't overreact or seek medical help merely to find out if they have it.</p>
<p>"Basically, it's using normal common sense," Wang said. "If you wouldn't go see the doctor for seasonal influenza, you shouldn't go just because we have H1N1 circulating."</p>
<p>The classic symptoms of flu are fever, cough, sore throat, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. This year, having several of those symptoms â€“ particularly fever and cough â€“ likely means you have H1N1.</p>
<p>Wang said people who believe they have the virus should stay home from school or work. It's safe to return when you start feeling up to normal activities and have gone 24 hours without fever, even if some tiredness and a dry cough persist.</p>
<p>Sick people who are in one of the risk groups for complications should contact their doctors for possible prescription of antiviral medication, which needs to be started within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>Wang said others who feel just plain rotten and don't seem to be getting any better after a few days should also contact their doctors.</p>
<p>Immediate medical help should be sought if symptoms such as shortness of breath, rapid or difficult breathing and chest pain develop.</p>
<p>In children, particular concerns include not drinking enough fluids, not eating, not waking up or interacting with others, and irritability.</p>
<p>Flu symptoms can be eased by drinking lots of fluids, avoiding drinks with caffeine, taking basic pain or fever medications and gargling with warm water. Children under 16 should not take acetylsalicylic acid (ASA or Aspirin).</p>
<p>"Most people can recover on their own with self-care," Wang said. "They really shouldn't go to emergency rooms unless it's an emergency."</p>

<p>Premier Jean Charest said yesterday that he will be vaccinated against the H1N1 swine flu virus.</p>
<p>"I personally will be vaccinated," Charest said in response to a question from Bernard Drainville, the Parti Québécois health critic.</p>
<p>"I urge all Quebecers to get vaccinated," the premier added.</p>
<p>Drainville suggested a lack of leadership by the government, noting that one-third of Quebecers do not intend to be vaccinated against this new virus.</p>

<p>Re: 'Bad idea' to dole out flu drug as preventive' (Oct. 17)</p>
<p>This article was misleading in its assertion that Union Gas obtained Tamiflu to dispense to employees as a preventive measure against H1N1 flu. This is not the case.</p>
<p>As a company that delivers critical services, Union Gas has a long-standing pandemic plan developed over years, and is kept current through consultation with medical experts and municipal, provincial and federal health and emergency-planning authorities.</p>
<p>For this reason, over the last three years, we have acquired a supply of Tamiflu as one resource in our overall plan in the event there is a pandemic that threatens to disrupt our operations and safety of our customers. Based on current information about H1N1, we have no plans to distribute any Tamiflu to our employees.</p>
<p>If an influenza pandemic was severe enough to warrant distribution of antiviral medication to our employees, we would do so only in full co-operation with health authorities. Responsible planning to ensure we maintain critical gas supply and emergency response services to our customers is part of the vital support Union Gas provides to the community.</p>

</p>
<p>Vaccinating hundreds of thousands of people, staffing clinics, testing samples and monitoring the H1N1 pandemic could cost the city as much as $4.4 million.</p>
<p>The cost is expected to be mitigated by redeploying existing city staff, and senior bureaucrats hope the province will step in to help.</p>
<p>But there is no guarantee of that and for a city already facing a $15-million deficit for next year, the impact could be devastating.</p>
<p>"We'll be hoping the province will pay additional out-of-pocket expenses for the H1N1 vaccination because the regular public health grant doesn't cover it," said Rob Rossini, general manager of finance.</p>
<p>But the province is already signalling its growing deficit will mean cuts to services such as education and health. Finance Minister Dwight Duncan is delivering a fall economic statement today.</p>
<p>The city's board of health, which is made up of council members, has fully backed what needs to be done to prepare for a pandemic, said Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"They said, 'You make sure the job gets done and we'll make sure the dollars are there.' "</p>
<p>He said immunization is staff-intensive because the vaccine must be administered by a nurse. Public health workers are being shifted from other programs and trained to administer the shot.</p>
<p>Other city departments have offered to redeploy staff to help fill non-medical duties at the clinics such as patient registration, shepherding supplies and data entry to satisfy provincial reporting obligations.</p>
<p>"This is the biggest vaccine campaign ever done in Hamilton, and maybe the biggest we'll ever do," Mackie said.</p>
<p>"We've had some indications from the province that they will provide some level of support for the clinics but it's not formalized and we're not sure of the level of support."</p>
<p>The Ontario government has already committed $600,000 to provide the technology to instantly report data about vaccine delivery, supplies and reactions.</p>
<p>The province has mandated local health departments to be ready to immunize 80 per cent of the population against the swine flu. That's 400,000 people in Hamilton, and everyone under 10 will require two doses.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario falls deep into the red; Province sees downgrade in credit rating as decline in revenue and investments point to a record $24.7-billion deficit</b>
</div><div>Karen Howlett  </div>
<div>910 words</div><div>22 October 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail (Breaking News)</div><div>GMBN</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>A steep decline in revenues coupled with investments in jobs training, infrastructure projects and the auto sector are pushing Ontario deep into the red, leaving it facing an unprecedented deficit of $24.7-billion for this fiscal year.</p>
<p>A growing gap between government revenues and expenses has forced Ontario Finance Minister Dwight Duncan (http://www.fin.gov.on.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/en/about/min.html[http://www.fin.gov.on.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/en/about/min.html]) to scrap his deficit forecasts for 2009-2010 and beyond, raising new questions about his plan to dig the province out of the worst recession in generations.</p>
<p>In another hit to the province, Ontario's ballooning deficit has prompted a major debt rating agency to downgrade the province's credit rating.</p>
<p>DBRS announced on Thursday evening (http://www.dbrs.com/research/230393/dbrs-downgrades-province-of-ontario-to-aa-low-and-r-1-middle-on-continued-fiscal-erosion.html[http://www.dbrs.com/research/230393/dbrs-downgrades-province-of-ontario-to-aa-low-and-r-1-middle-on-continued-fiscal-erosion.html]) that it has cut the rating on the province's debt by one notch to double A (low). The move follows the release of the Ontario government's economic outlook, revealing that the province is facing an unprecedented deficit of $24.7-billion for this fiscal year.</p>
<p>While Canada's biggest province has not lost its coveted AA rating, one it has enjoyed since July, 2001, the downgrade could make it more expensive to borrow money at a time when it is struggling with deficits and rising debt levels.</p>
<p>DBRS said in a statement that the diversification of Ontario's economy should help it eventually regain its place as a leader among the provinces. However, DBRS said the McGuinty government's limited success at reining in spending on provincial programs “raises considerable doubt” about its ability to balance the books by fiscal 2015-2016. “Furthermore, the poor performance foreseen for the years to come will boost the debt burden to the highest level on record,” DBRS said.</p>
<p>Without tax increases or a meaningful effort to cut spending, restoring the debt burden to levels prior to the economic recession could take more than a decade, the rating agency said. The province's debt is forecast to climb 22 per cent in fiscal 2009-2010 to $184.1-billion. This will leave Ontario with a debt-to-gross domestic product ratio of 37 per cent, the third highest among the provinces, DBRS said.</p>
<p>In his economic outlook released on Thursday, Mr. Duncan is forecasting that the province is facing deficits tallying $65.2-billion over the next three years, well above his projection of $36-billion in the budget last March.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan told Ontarians last March to brace themselves for a record deficit of $14.1-billion for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2010. In June, he said the ballooning cost of rescuing the ailing auto sector would push the tally to $18.5-billion. Ontario's $3.5-billion commitment to the bailout of General Motors Corp. largely accounted for Mr. Duncan's first fiscal surprise.</p>
<p>He is now projecting a deficit of $24.7-billion for this fiscal year, a much gloomier outlook that is based on the fact that previous forecasts for how much revenues would flow into government coffers and how much it would spend on provincial programs were too optimistic.</p>
<p>Mr. Duncan has shaved $5.8-billion off his revenue forecast, reducing the tally to $90.2-billion. At the same time, he is now forecasting that expenses will increase $4.8-billion from the projection in the budget, to $113.7-billion.</p>
<p>As a result, red ink will be a fact of life for some time to come as the province confronts declining revenues and helps Ontarians weather the global recession by maintaining key public services. Measures to maintain services and lessen the effect of the economic crisis have led to increased spending on vital programs in the health care, education and social services sectors, Mr. Duncan says in his outlook.</p>
<p>“During this global recession, our task is clear: create jobs, help families and position the province for future growth,” Mr. Duncan says.</p>
<p>The government is also facing demands to spend extra money fighting the H1N1 virus. It has set aside $650-million to address the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>The Ontario Treasury Board is launching a review of all spending to ensure that the key priorities of the McGuinty government – job creation, health care and education – remain sustainable. The outcome of that review will be part of next year's budget.</p>
<p>“We will call on our partners in the public and the broader public sector to help us sustain public services in the long term,” Mr. Duncan says. “We will also review all agencies, boards and commissions to ensure they are meeting Ontarians' needs and expectations.”</p>
<p>The government is forecasting that the economy will shrink 3.5 per cent this year but make modest gains and grow 2 per cent in 2010. However, Mr. Duncan warns that growth in employment and government revenues will lag behind the economic recovery.</p>
<p>This year's budget allocated $32.5-billion for investments in transit, roads, affordable housing and other infrastructure projects to help stimulate the ailing economy and create jobs.</p>
<p>The government is also investing $750-million over two years in skills training to help laid-off workers find new jobs.</p>

<p>The NFL has created a policy to provide relief to teams if they're hit hard by the swine flu. Other leagues have yet to do the same. The Cleveland Browns might need that help this weekend. A dozen players missed practice Wednesday because of flulike symptoms. The NFL sent out a memo to teams earlier this month saying they can receive roster exemptions if enough players contract swine flu. The NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball said Wednesday that they do not have similar provisions.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Societal push needed for telework to take off; Speakers say catalyst could be H1N1, fuel prices</b>
</div><div>Gina Teel   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>481 words</div><div>22 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Telework is far from a new concept, yet the uptake on working remotely isn't quite where its proponents would like it to be.</p>
<p>A catalyst such as a severe outbreak of H1N1 could force the issue, as employers could find themselves relying on telework programs to keep their business running in a time of crisis, said Bob Klay of Klay Information Management Consulting Inc.</p>
<p>The same holds true to maintain business continuity in many situations, be it a reduced workforce due to illness or unforeseen events like the loss of a building or loss of IT, Klay told a sold-out breakfast forum on the future of work on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"You need to be prepared to really protect your business. Individuals are easy to change, relatively speaking. It's the business that has a hard time to change," he said.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Peter Tertzakian, chief energy economist of ARC Financial Corp. and bestselling author, said he views telework as a part of a broader societal change.</p>
<p>More broadly, it's about a changing society as it relates to technology and energy.</p>
<p>Telework could help change the current North American lifestyle, which has been defined by energy.</p>
<p>It's a model that sees people "driving in to a central core like a herd of cattle first thing in the morning . . . and then doing the same thing at the end of the day when you only interact with five or six people," Tertzakian said.</p>
<p>Societal change is brought about by many reasons. One of them is the high price of gasoline.</p>
<p>Tertzakian said the trigger point is around $80 to $85 per barrel of oil, or $3 per gallon of gasoline.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, oil crossed $80 for the first time in over a year. On Wednesday, it was $81.37.</p>
<p>"There's no question that high energy prices are going to be a catalyst, particularly high oil prices, and I believe we're looking at the trigger point right in the face right now," he said.</p>
<p>Telework will also need to be a compelling proposition for corporations before it will be fully adopted, or perhaps even require a marshalling event to encourage more widespread adoption.</p>
<p>Karen Chown, director corporate and community engagement at Calgary Economic Development, talked about the WORKshift initiative underway there, which promotes telework in the Calgary business community.</p>
<p>Telework helps companies compete for talent, as it provides flexibility in where and how they work.</p>
<p>She cited the recent blast of winter-like weather in Calgary that snarled traffic for hours.</p>
<p>"If you consider, if we had more people who were able to work remotely, how much more productive would we all have been that day?" Chown said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ignatieff to let Tories stew in 'frying pan'</b>
</div><div>Don Martin   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1298 words</div><div>22 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Laughter has returned to the floor above Stephen Harper's office on Parliament Hill, where the Liberal leader is gleefully rewriting the party's winter playbook.</p>
<p>It's no longer that Stephen Harper's "time is up" in the mad rush to force a snap election. Emerging from a hellish month of everything going wrong, Michael Ignatieff has changed his mind and plans to "let him stew" until next spring to see if he can build on changing Liberal fortunes.</p>
<p>While an election delay only makes sense for a party sinking to deep lows in the polls, it's also true a Conservative government basking in a polling popularity bump and loud applause for its piano-playing prime minister just 10 days ago suddenly appears on the defensive.</p>
<p>That's why the most relieved face in Canadian politics today is the pink-tied leader who sat in his Centre Block office one floor above</p>
<p>Harper's for a candid Calgary Herald interview, anxious to switch the channel after the weeks of public backlash and internal dissent stemming from the now-defunct decision to oppose the government at every election-triggering opportunity.</p>
<p>The voters, a seemingly re-energized Ignatieff predicts, will need a little more time, but they'll learn to loathe the Tories again.</p>
<p>That's arguably a tough swallow, given his party's fracturing in Quebec and faltering in Ontario, for which the leader admits he's not without blame. "I've still got a lot of work to do . . . but I think that the Conservatives are now in the frying pan," Ignatieff insists.</p>
<p>"What we get for the $56-billion deficit will be the legacy question of Stephen Harper's administration. What Canadians feel they've got is a massive and grotesque Conservative re-election campaign and a lot of the pork is starting to stink, particularly coming from a government that promised accountability."</p>
<p>He has cause for sudden optimism. His Liberal back-room is actually digging up enough dirt to sustain allegations of the stimulus package as partisan slush.</p>
<p>It's more than just that one oversized cheque bearing the Conservative party logo. Conservative MPs are now quietly questioning even the wisdom of their own signatures on the fake cheques.</p>
<p>Other indications are piling up that the use of deficit dollars for electioneering advancement has gone systemic. Various newspaper investigations have waded through a government maze which confounds simple stimulus analysis to discover a Conservative riding bias in pocketing the handouts, which appear to validate Liberal research angrily disputed by government officials who insist it will all balance out in the end.</p>
<p>The Liberal pitbulls are also attacking the use of signs hailing federal government contributions to basic office tower renovations, an obvious over-the-top promotion wasting taxpayer dollars.</p>
<p>Click-ready connections between neutral departmental sites and Stephen Harper photo spreads or his piano playing video have been discovered and clearly embarrassed the Prime Minister's Office enough that it ordered them delinked.</p>
<p>A national billboard campaign to promote the stimulus spending is reportedly coming, a waste of money that will likely be viewed as Conservative self-gratification overkill. With economic policy ads dramatically outpacing the number of commercials for H1N1 public health information, even the campaign for the very popular home renovation program has taken on a government propaganda taint.</p>
<p>Reporters have also discovered Harper's elaborate showcase event last spring to reveal some basic fiscal progress racked up a six-figure price tag when it could've and should've been staged in Ottawa for free.</p>
<p>Even the government's handling of the Afghanistan file is taking a hard hit, which seems to mesh with the Liberal theme of this as a heavy-handed government fixated on snuffing out dissidents and unscripted distraction.</p>
<p>Former chief of defence staff Rick Hillier's autobiography, A Soldier First, was generally supportive of the Harper government, but he did unleash on the Prime Minister's Office for its control-freakish bid to gag and hide him from public view.</p>
<p>And there are the nagging optics of the government's refusal to co-operate with a Military Police Complaints Commission probe into Afghan detainees as it prevents a key diplomat from releasing his eyewitness reports on prisoner torture.</p>
<p>"If they'd let people talk freely, we'd be out the other side of this inquiry by now," snarls Ignatieff. "Instead, we're in this lockdown, coverup mode where the only thing they're trying to protect is their reputation, not the honour of the Canadian Forces."</p>
<p>Add all this up and the recently besieged Michael Ignatieff has a pinch-me-I'm-dreaming attitude as he moves to tackle 'job No. 1' of undoing his personal slap-down from Conservative 'just visiting' attack ads.</p>
<p>"How would you feel when you're watching the third or fourth inning of a ball game and every time there's a commercial break, you're on there? I'm not complaining because this is politics, but for heaven's sake there's no big mystery why my numbers are down. I've been beaten up for six months," he says.</p>
<p>So will Ignatieff lift his attack from the Commons floor to the airwaves, trading sucker punch for sucker punch on television? No way, he says.</p>
<p>"It's not about Michael Ignatieff. It's about this damn government," he fumes. "I don't want to attack his patriotism or his family or his loyalty to the country. What bothers people about the Conservatives is their 24-hour hyper-partisan politics of personal destruction and I'm not going to fall into that trap."</p>
<p>Hmmm. So where do nice guys usually finish?</p>
<p>But aside from Ignatieff's good week, which could be a short-lived phenomenon, he still faces the dual challenges of selling a redefining image of himself and filling the policy void with an idea or two that voters can grasp.</p>
<p>He seems determined to campaign against Stephen Harper as a Machiavellian monster whose heart only beats when he sees an opening for political gain or to inflict damage on his opponents, which will be a hard sell as a platform.</p>
<p>"Harper's a political animal in every sense of the word. It's all politics, all the time," Ignatieff says. "I'm not that kind of politician. It was easy for me to vote in the middle of a national crisis to support a budget I had difficulty with because I thought the bottom was falling out of this place. But eight months later you look at this and think, what the hell's happening? From zero deficit to $32 billion to $56 billion and all of it with a Conservative logo on it."</p>
<p>That's a stretch, but after 40 minutes with Ignatieff, surrounded by suddenly upbeat staff, you get the sense that a leader given up for dead has at least checked out of palliative care.</p>
<p>Nobody will be talking about Prime Minister Ignatieff any time soon, but there's some mojo in a Liberal momentum that had been full-stopped all summer by his disappearing act and all fall by his strategic missteps.</p>
<p>It's been noted so often it's almost a bad cliche, but governments defeat themselves and the Official Opposition is just there to scoop up the inheritance.</p>
<p>If the Conservatives continue to act unapologetically as if they, to lift a Liberal line, reign over their own Cheque Republic, they'll buy themselves only trouble in the Commons and in the election to come.</p>

</div><div>Sarah O'Donnell   </div>

<p>Edmonton-area school districts say they are seeing a spike in absenteeism at some schools, a sign that flu season is hitting classrooms earlier in the year than usual.</p>
<p>In St. Albert, Ecole Secondaire Sainte Marguerite d'Youville reported 33 per cent of its 450 junior and senior high school students were absent on Tuesday, while one Elk Island Public school saw 27 per cent of its students out of class at one point last week.</p>
<p>School absentee rates across Canada are being monitored closely as health officials watch to see how a second wave of H1N1 influenza impacts the population. Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said more than 25 schools across Alberta have seen flu clusters hit students hard.</p>
<p>Schools report sick rates to health officials when their absentee rate goes over 10 per cent. Predy said absentee rates nearing 40 per cent are relatively unusual during a regular flu season.</p>
<p>The flu has hit schools slightly earlier than other years, although Alberta's flu season traditionally runs from the fall until April. "We're seeing a higher number of cases than we normally would in mid-October," Elk Island Public Schools occupational health and safety specialist Lisa Johnston said. "Normally it comes later."</p>
<p>The Elk Island school that reported nearly a third of its students absent last week now is back to a 10-percent absentee rate, Johnston said. Five other elementary and junior high schools in the district also have reported absentee rates of 10 per cent or higher in the last two weeks, she said.</p>
<p>The illnesses appear to be a combination of H1N1, seasonal flu and a gastrointestinal illness, but the predominant circulating virus is the H1N1, Johnston said.</p>
<p>Greater St. Albert Catholic school district Supt. David Keohane said many students at Sainte Marguerite d'Youville appear to be sick with a seasonal flu bug.</p>
<p>"What we are unable to determine is whether the absentee rate is simply linked to very strong due diligence on behalf of the public to be strong stewards of public health and to keep students home who are experiencing the lesser symptoms of what flu might look like," Keohane said.</p>
<p>The school expects to send home a letter from Alberta Health Services to parents in the near future, giving them an update and advice, he said. Health officials have not advised any school closures.</p>
<p>"The initial telephone advice we received was it's simply important for all people attending our schools to continue to engage in the most important preventive care, and that is frequent hand-washing and to be mindful of appropriate sneezing techniques," Keohane said.</p>
<p>Predy said swabs of students were done at the first 20 schools to report flu clusters and increased absenteeism in the province. All swab results confirmed H1N1 cases, not the seasonal strain. Children typically are among the first to get sick with flu, but health officials say they are not at high risk for serious illness.</p>
<p>Edmonton schools also are seeing a growing number of absent students. None of Edmonton Public's approximately 200 schools have crossed the 10-per-cent reporting threshold, but spokeswoman Jane Sterling said the district is tracking 31 schools that look like they've had quite a spike in absenteeism over the last few days.</p>
<p>Edmonton Catholic Schools had three schools report a tenth of its student body absent this week.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services is advising that children, even those who have been sick, should be getting both flu shots this year unless they have received a positive confirmation of H1N1, at which point they can receive the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccinations set to start - H1N1 program aims first at Manitobans most at risk</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen and Larry Kusch   </div>
<div>897 words</div><div>22 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Manitobans from all corners of the province should get vaccinated for the H1N1 influenza in the coming days to reduce needless deaths and minimize the strain on the health-care system, the province's top health officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The largest vaccination program in Canadian history rolls out in Manitoba Monday with the first batch of the vaccine going to people most at risk of becoming seriously ill or dying from H1N1 flu. Manitoba's 1.2 million doses will arrive in batches and, in following weeks, other Manitobans will be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"We want to ensure that those individuals who will benefit the most from the vaccine receive it first," Health Minister Theresa Oswald said. "All Manitobans who need or want the vaccine and are expected to benefit from it will be able to get it, but perhaps not in the first week."</p>
<p>The free vaccine will be administered by the province's 11 regional health authorities, including at sites in remote communities. Officials say information about clinics will be posted on each health authority's website and through the media.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority expects to announce dates, times and locations today.</p>
<p>The start of the mass public immunization program came after Health Canada gave its approval to the vaccine Wednesday morning. Manitoba has already earmarked $50 million towards the H1N1 flu campaign, but Premier Greg Selinger said Wednesday during a tour of St. Boniface General Hospital that cost could jump to at least $100 million.</p>
<p>"We intend to be advertising the heck out of this thing, letting people know that we're ready for the next phase, we're ready for the next wave," Oswald said. "Or reminding people, priority populations, you need to continue to come first, you need to continue to come aggressively."</p>
<p>What no one can predict is how hard the H1NI virus will hit Manitoba this fall. In the first wave last spring, seven people with confirmed cases died, although that number might have been twice as high if all patients were tested. About 100 people were admitted to intensive care units for treatment.</p>
<p>To date, there have been 905 confirmed cases of H1N1, with 13 new cases reported this week. There were only three cases reported from Sept 1. to Oct. 12. The pandemic wave is expected to last eight to 10 weeks.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus hits most people like a regular flu, but for high-risk individuals it can be deadly if not treated quickly, said Manitoba's Chief Provincial Public Health Officer Dr. Joel Kettner.</p>
<p>"I can't underestimate the importance of everybody understanding that if you're really sick, if you're short of breath or you have symptoms of pneumonia, that is a medical emergency," he said. "Early care and appropriate care can prevent a lot of the preventable deaths that we are aiming this whole program to minimize."</p>
<p>Kettner said the vaccination program is targeted at individual protection rather than immunizing as many people as possible to stop the disease.</p>
<p>"It's not like getting everyone's immunity against measles high enough for a long enough time that you actually eliminate the spread of measles in a community."</p>
<p>He said health officials also want to reduce the chance of more seriously ill people needing intensive care than hospitals have the capacity to treat.</p>
<p>"There's lots of other good reasons to get the vaccine aside from lowering the risk of dying," he said.</p>
<p>Oswald said regional health authorities expect people to ask to be vaccinated who are not on the priority list. The RHAs will be flexible, but do have the power to turn people away, depending on the circumstances.</p>
<p>"We are leaving the door open for regional health authorities to say, 'Yes, you are entitled to the vaccine, just not yet,'" Oswald said.</p>
<p>"We expect a lot of judgment and flexibility in the decisions about who's going to be vaccinated and when," Kettner added.</p>
<p>Nurses and other health-care workers are among those given top priority for receiving the H1N1 flu vaccine, but they won't be required to get the shot, Oswald said.</p>
<p>"We know that the medical experts are telling us that one of the single greatest ways that health-care workers can protect themselves is through the vaccine," Oswald said. "So we have put them in the top priority group to receive the vaccine first. We are, however, not mandating the vaccine."</p>
<p>Sandi Mowat, president of the Manitoba Nurses Union, said her group believes nurses should decide for themselves whether to get the shot.</p>
<p>"They are professionals; they have the ability to make that choice. And certainly we believe it should be voluntary," Mowat said Wednesday. She could not estimate what percentage of nurses are likely to receive the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Mowat noted that the vaccine is only one line of defence available to nurses, who will also have access to special respirators and other equipment when treating patients.</p>
<p>Kettner said while getting a shot is voluntary, common sense dictates you should get one.</p>
<p>"Every case of influenza that's prevented, it reduces another opportunity for someone to get infected from that person," he said.</p>

<p>Athol Murray College of Notre Dame lifted its self-imposed quarantine Wednesday, enabling high school students to once again participate in high school athletic competitions.</p>
<p>Officials at the residential school in Wilcox decided to postpone or cancel sporting events on Friday in consultation with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region and the school's health nurses in an attempt to contain an outbreak of H1N1 at the school.</p>
<p>"We still have some kids with flu-like symptoms, but we have no new H1N1 confirmations other than the seven that are already reported," school president Rob Palmarin said.</p>

<p>Health professionals say the benefits far outweigh the risks associated with getting the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>While the swine flu has killed nine British Columbians, scientific studies show the odds of having serious vaccine complications are about one in a million.</p>
<p>"Benefits greatly exceed the risks," said Dr. William Bowie, a University of B.C. professor of infectious diseases. "Most of the 'risks' that have been mentioned are myths or fear-mongering."</p>
<p>Bowie said the one area where little scientific data exists is for pregnant women taking vaccines with an adjuvant. Some may decide to wait for adjuvant-free vaccines, but they run the risk of getting H1N1 while they wait.</p>
<p>People with severe egg allergies should not get the vaccine, or those under six months. Children aged six months to 10 years need two half-doses 21 days apart.</p>

<p>Since H1N1 flu broke out in B.C., nine people in the province have died from it.</p>
<p>Five were in the Fraser Health Authority, two in Interior Health, one in the Vancouver Coastal health region and one on Vancouver Island. The dead include a boy of seven, a 19-year-old man and a woman living on the Beecher Bay reserve in Metchosin on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>The ninth to die was a middle-aged man in the Fraser Health region who had another serious medical condition.</p>
<p>The chief medical health officer for the Fraser Health region, Dr. Roland Guasparini, said there's nothing unusual about the fact that the region currently has the highest number of deaths and hospitalizations from H1N1.</p>
<p>"We have over a third of the population in Fraser Health," he said. "Five out of nine deaths doesn't signify anything."</p>
<p>Names have emerged for only two of B.C.'s swine-flu victims.</p>
<p>On Oct. 6, B.C.'s Susan March, 25, died in Calgary, four days after becoming infected with H1N1. Media reports suggested obesity may have been an underlying factor.</p>
<p>A 26-year-old Mission woman, Ashley Miller, died from H1N1 on Oct. 11, two days after entering hospital. She was the first to die with no underlying health condition.</p>
<p>B.C. has had 111 severe swine-flu cases, 30 ending in admissions to intensive-care units. Most cases in the province have been mild or moderate.</p>
<p>Last week, 33 new severe cases were confirmed, 25 of them in the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control has stopped reporting numbers for new H1N1 cases.</p>

</p>
<p>Economic restraints, H1N1 fears and fewer Canadian children of trick-or-treating age mean this Halloween, we may be opening our doors to one of the smallest turnouts of costumed candy-seekers in nearly two decades.</p>
<p>Results of recent surveys suggest the economy will affect the Halloween plans of about one-third of households, while slightly more -- 36 per cent -- are concerned about contracting the H1N1 flu virus. Add that to the latest Statistics Canada data, which show the pool of kids ages five to 14 is on track to hit a low not seen since 1990, and it appears Canadians will be eating leftover candy well into Christmas.</p>
<p>"We're looking at the lowest potential turnout in quite a while," says Statistics Canada's William Dore, though he notes the figures don't account for "younger kids who are hauled out by their parents in little bunny outfits" or older teens who push the holiday's age limits.</p>
<p>Those who do participate on Oct. 31 will experience a very different ritual than the one enjoyed by earlier generations, according to Halloween expert Jim Farrelly.</p>
<p>"I'm sure that kids will be instructed not to touch anybody as they go door-to-door and that hand-sanitizers will be used between stops," says Farrelly, a professor of English at the University of Dayton in Ohio. "It's going to be a very clinical Halloween."</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada encourages trick-or-treaters to practise such infection-prevention methods as sneezing into their sleeves and maintaining clean hands.</p>
<p>Beyond such timely considerations, however, Farrelly believes the holiday is undergoing fundamentally "profane" changes that may ultimately put people off for good.</p>
<p>"Parents have told their children about all the dangerous things that can occur, and the kids seem scared to death. They don't even say 'trick-or-treat' anymore; they just stand there with open bags until you drop something in," says Farrelly.</p>
<p>If attendance is lower this year, demographics will likely also play a role.</p>
<p>Demographer Julien Berard-Chagnon cites a decrease in fertility rates, as well as a decline in the number of women of "prime" fertility age, between the mid-1990s and mid-2000s, for Canada's teetering trick-or-treating pool.</p>

<p>The spectre of swine flu hovers over us all. Parents, at least, have a better grasp than their children of the risks, and can easily put into perspective what is being reported on H1N1.</p>
<p>Despite media reports of pandemics and deaths of seemingly healthy Canadians, kids don't yet appear preoccupied with swine flu, according to local educators and parents.</p>
<p>"Every kid is different. Some kids are more anxious than others. There's certainly a lot of media attention on H1N1," cautions Marjorie MacDonald of the University of Victoria's school of nursing.</p>
<p>Schools have helped by keeping kids informed through handouts and morning announcements, according to Sean Powell, vice-principal of a local middle school. This helps take the fear of the unknown out of H1N1.</p>
<p>"I haven't had any students come to me with anxiety," Powell says, while local elementary school principal Bonnie Stacy says she doesn't hear kids talk about swine flu in the playground.</p>
<p>"They're busy being kids," Stacy adds.</p>
<p>However, the local school year did start with new hand-sanitizers in classrooms. Also, there were the usual flu-prevention reminders to wash hands frequently, avoid sharing water bottles, and sneeze or cough into a sleeve rather than a hand.</p>
<p>Karen Robinson's two children, six and three, haven't mentioned H1N1. However, they use the hand-sanitizers at school, something they enjoy doing.</p>
<p>"Mine aren't as aware as older ones about germs," Robinson says.</p>
<p>Child psychologist Magali Brulot says her four-year-old twins haven't talked about the flu, but her six- and seven-year-olds have. It's normal for children to ask questions about H1N1 -- or any publicized health concern -- and to feel some uncertainty or anxiety.</p>
<p>There had been a case of swine flu at her son's school, and the person recovered. "I now use this as an example with children I see in my practice," she says.</p>
<p>Mary Mah says her two elementary school age children aren't worried about H1N1, partly, she suspects, because she's not worried.</p>
<p>Kids take their cues from parents, according to both MacDonald and parental educator Allison Rees.</p>
<p>"If parents are upset and worried, kids pick up on it," MacDonald says.</p>
<p>Rees sees little difference between the spectre of H1N1 and what parents underwent during 9-11.</p>
<p>"Kids look to their parents for calmness," she says.</p>
<p>When children bring up these topics, they want reassurance, according to Brulot. Acknowledge your child's emotional reaction and let them know that they are not alone, she says.</p>
<p>"Be matter of fact and talk about generalities. State that there are many different types of flu bugs that go around, some worse than others, and that the best thing we can do as a family is try to stay healthy by eating healthy meals, being active and having good hygiene," Brulot says.</p>
<p>Rees and MacDonald stress being ready to answer kids' questions. Know the facts first, they say. "It might not be a bad idea to ask what they're hearing in school about H1N1," MacDonald says. This can nip any misinformation or festering anxiety in the bud.</p>
<p>Gabriela Hirt's two children are somewhat aware of the H1N1, largely because of the use of anti-bacterial soaps at school, and her son's soccer team is no longer allowed to shake hands after games.</p>
<p>"I don't have the feeling they are worried. They haven't been asking questions," she says. Hirt's eight-year-old son is a bit of a worrier.</p>
<p>"He'd probably worry if he heard about (H1N1) a lot, and if people were dying. He'd ask a ton of questions."</p>
<p>She'd just tell him "usually healthy people get over it -- you have a healthy body and would get over it quickly."</p>
<p>Basically, that's what Rees recommends parents do when asked about flu deaths. "Be honest," she says. "Give the facts without sugarcoating. The big thing for kids is to know we (parents) can handle things."</p>
<p>Hirt's family doesn't have a television so her son is spared visual bombardments about H1N1. Hirt keeps the radio off when he's at home. That's something Rees recommends now to ease kids' concerns, just as she told parents to turn off televisions during 9-11.</p>
<p>Hirt is more concerned about the H1N1 precautions than the actual flu. "It would be really sad to have a touch-o-phobic society," she says.</p>
<p>TALKING TO YOUR KIDS ABOUT H1N1</p>
<p>Get a dialogue going with kids to reassure them about swine flu:</p>
<p>- Initiate conversation. Kids on their own can come up with stories often more frightening than the reality.</p>
<p>- Ask them what they have heard. Reassure them with the facts.</p>
<p>- Keep explanations very simple for younger children.</p>
<p>- Assure your children there is no need to be afraid. Doctors and nurses are working hard to limit the spread and help the sick.</p>
<p>- Tell your kids the new virus causes a sickness a lot like the ones we see every year, but more people may get sick because the virus is new.</p>
<p>- Tell them the most serious pandemic happened almost 100 years ago and even then, before people had access to today's medical knowledge, almost everyone who got sick recovered.</p>
<p>- Although some people go to hospital, the majority who got sick in North America got better at home.</p>
<p>- Remind your kids of ways to avoid getting sick. Frequent handwashing; avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth; don't share cups or utensils; cough or sneeze into a tissue or into your sleeve not your hands.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The WHO's political pandemic</b>
</div><div>Michael Fumento   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>756 words</div><div>22 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>As evidence continues to mount that swine flu is more of a piglet than a raging razorback, why isn't curiosity mounting about why the World Health Organization (WHO) declared it a pandemic? And why does the agency continue to insist we're going to get hammered? The answers have far less to do with world health than with redistribution of world wealth.</p>
<p>Medically, the pandemic moniker is unjustifiable. When the WHO made its official declaration in June, we were 11 weeks into the outbreak, and swine flu had only killed 144 people worldwide -- the same number who die of seasonal flu worldwide every few hours. The mildest pandemics of the 20th century killed at least a million people worldwide. After six months, swine flu has killed about as many people as the seasonal flu does every six days.</p>
<p>So how could WHO make such an outrageous claim?</p>
<p>Simple. It rewrote the definition of "pandemic."</p>
<p>A previous official definition required "simultaneous epidemics worldwide with enormous numbers of deaths and illness." Severity is crucial because seasonal flu always causes worldwide simultaneous epidemics. But the definition promulgated in April eliminated severity as a factor.</p>
<p>That's also how we can have a "pandemic" when six months of epidemiological data show swine flu to be far milder than the seasonal variety. New York City statistics show it to be perhaps a 10th as lethal.</p>
<p>Swine flu isn't some sort of alien from outer space as we've been led to believe, but rather "the same subtype as seasonal A/H1N1 that has been circulating since 1977," as the BMJ observes. It's "something our immune systems have seen before," echoes Peter Palese of New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, because WHO dubbed this a "pandemic," vaccination plans, emergency response measures and frightening predictions have been based on comparisons with true pandemics that by definition were especially severe. That includes the August report from the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology with its "plausible scenario" of "30,000 -- 90,000 [U. S.] deaths" peaking in "mid-October."</p>
<p>Check your calendar. So why did WHO do it?</p>
<p>In part, because it was losing credibility over the refusal of avian flu H5N1 to go pandemic and kill as many as 150 million people worldwide, as the WHO's "flu czar" had predicted in 2005. Around the world, nations stockpiled antiviral medicines and H5N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>So when pig flu conveniently appeared, the WHO essentially crossed out "avian," inserted "swine," and WHO Director-General Margaret Chan could boast: "The world can now reap the benefits of investments over the last five years in pandemic preparedness."</p>
<p>Yet this doesn't explain why the agency hyped avian flu in the first place, nor why it exaggerated HIV infections by more than 10 times, or why it spread hysteria over Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome(SARS). That disease ultimately killed a day's worth of seasonal flu victims before vanishing.</p>
<p>But the SARS scare was enough, leading to a broad expansion of WHO powers, including a degree of direct authority over national health agencies. It's now using that to leverage more authority and a bigger budget. No shocker there.</p>
<p>What may be surprising is that it wants to use that power to help bring about a global economic and social revolution -- and that Director-General Chan was so blunt about it in a speech in Copenhagen last month.</p>
<p>She said "ministers of health" should take advantage of the "devastating impact" swine flu will have on poorer nations to tell "heads of state and ministers of finance, tourism and trade" that: - The belief that "living conditions and health status of the poor would somehow automatically improve as countries modernized, liberalized their trade and improved their economies" is false. - "Changes in the functioning of the global economy" are needed to "distribute wealth on the basis of" values "like community, solidarity, equity and social justice." - "The international policies and systems that govern financial markets, economies, commerce, trade and foreign affairs have not operated with fairness as an explicit policy objective."</p>
<p>Splendid! So let's put the WHO in charge of worldwide economic and social engineering.</p>
<p>Then let's form a new agency that sees disease as something to prevent and treat rather than something to exploit.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 turns up at turkey farm; Outbreak at Kitchener livestock facility no risk to public health, medical officer says</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>535 words</div><div>21 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>An outbreak of H1N1 at a Kitchener turkey farm poses a "minimal" public health threat, but underscores the importance of containing the spread of the flu virus, Ontario's chief medical officer of health says.</p>
<p>"I want to assure Ontarians that the risk to human health from this situation is minimal," Dr. Arlene King told a news conference Tuesday.</p>
<p>The birds, from Hybrid Turkeys, likely became infected from human contact, said Ontario's chief veterinarian Dr. Deb Stark.</p>
<p>Public health officials are now contacting some 19 individuals believed to have had contact with the flock. A statement issued by Hybrid Tuesday evening said a limited number of employees had exhibited cold-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The outbreak will no doubt garner international attention because of the potential for the virus to mutate into a more serious strain when it jumps from one species to another. That did not happen in this case.</p>
<p>Canada is the second country to experience an outbreak among turkeys. Chile discovered an outbreak in August, prompting the United Nations to issue a warning about the possibility of H1N1 combining with another influenza strain, creating a more virulent one.</p>
<p>"It's prudent that we try to avoid transmission of influenza viruses between species to avoid any pressures on the virus that could result in any changes," King said.</p>
<p>The Kitchener outbreak serves as a "clarion call" to people who work with livestock to get both the seasonal and H1N1 flu shots, she said.</p>
<p>Seasonal shots are now available and the federal government is expected to announce this week an early release of the H1N1 vaccine. It is possible the vaccine will be available at Toronto hospitals and long-term facilities as soon as Monday.</p>
<p>Anyone experiencing flu symptoms should avoid contact with animals, King urged.</p>
<p>There is "no risk to food safety" because no birds or eggs from the facility have entered the food chain, King said.</p>
<p>The birds in question are bred for their eggs, not their meat. The operator of the farm became concerned about the flock when egg production fell. It was confirmed they had H1N1 on Friday, four days after Thanksgiving when turkey is a mainstay meal.</p>
<p>Some 3,500 of 7,000 birds at the operation have been quarantined in one of two barns at the farm. There is no need to cull them because they are expected to recover, Stark said.</p>
<p>"The other barn remains totally normal with respect to egg production," said veterinarian Dr. Helen Wojcinski. Strict biosecurity measures were already in place on the farm and between the two barns, she said.</p>
<p>It usually takes about two to three weeks for a turkey flock to recover from a virus, Wojcinski said.</p>
<p>Last April, H1N1 infected pigs in Alberta, resulting in China issuing a ban on the import of pork from the province.</p>

<p>They're putting more air in the air kiss.</p>
<p>Fashionistas, known for the faux intimacy of the no-contact, two-cheek smooch, are putting even more distance between each other at Toronto Fashion Week.</p>
<p>As worries about H1N1 flu swirl, and even the common handshake becomes a cause for concern, some of the thousands of fashion players gathering this week in tents on King St. W. are taking a defensive stance.</p>
<p>Recoiling would be considered impolite, in this well-mannered world, says Susie Sheffman, fashion director for Fashion magazine.</p>
<p>While the kisses have lost all semblance of intimacy, they are still an important part of the fashion show circuit.</p>
<p>"I don't think my fate is to die of swine flu," says fashion show fixture Marlene Shiff. "I've lived my life on the edge."</p>
<p>Barbara Atkin, vice-president of fashion direction for <span class="companylink">Holt Renfrew</span>, says the trend, which started in Milan and Paris, is to keep someone at bay if you even suspect you might have a cold.</p>

</p>
<p>B.C. has suffered its ninth death from the H1N1 flu virus, health officials confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p>The ninth death was a middle-aged man from the Fraser Health region who had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>The B.C. Centre for Disease Control also confirmed that the eighth person to die from the H1N1 virus had no underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Ashley Miller, 26, of Mission died from H1N1 on Oct. 11, two days after being admitted to Abbotsford Regional Hospital.</p>
<p>"Of those nine [deaths], one individual did not have any underlying health conditions," said Ritinder Harry, spokeswoman for the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Fraser Health officials are not disclosing in which community in the region, which stretches from Burnaby to Hope, the deceased man lived.</p>
<p>"Given the level of activity in B.C. right now, death from complications from the influenza in healthy individuals can happen," said Harry.</p>
<p>B.C. leads the country in positive tests for H1N1.</p>
<p>"Since this new pandemic strain began circulating [in April] we've had 2,301 lab-confirmed cases," said Harry.</p>
<p>"The vast majority of cases in B.C. are under age 65. Of those 2,301 cases, 111 individuals were hospitalized, including 30 who have been admitted to intensive-care units."</p>
<p>Thirty-three people were admitted to hospital in the past week with H1N1, including six who were admitted to ICU.</p>
<p>Common symptoms of HIN1 are fever, headache, sore throat, body aches, muscle pain and runny nose.</p>
<p>Some people, especially children, also experience nausea, vomiting or diarrhea.</p>
<p>With B.C. well into its second wave of HIN1, health officials urge everyone to take precautions.</p>
<p>"The biggest message is, if you're sick stay home," said Harry. "Experts have determined that H1N1 flu virus can spread very easily from person to person, so stay home from work or school if you're sick."</p>
<p>The majority of lab-confirmed cases in B.C. have been mild or moderate in severity, with the patients either having already recovered or currently recovering.</p>
<p>"Exercise common-sense precautionary measures," said Harry. "Cover your nose or mouth with a tissue when you sneeze and throw the tissue in the trash after you use it. When you cough, do so in your sleeve. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze."</p>

</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>

</p>
<p>More than half the hospitalizations for human swine flu in the U.S. are occurring in people under age 25, officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>Almost one-quarter of the deaths are occurring in the same age group.</p>
<p>Of 4,958 people hospitalized with lab-confirmed H1N1 from Sept. 1 to Oct. 10 in 27 states, 53 per cent were people under 25, Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the national centre for immunization and respiratory diseases, said in a media briefing Tuesday.</p>
<p>"We know that we're missing cases, so the numbers will be underestimates of the full amount of disease the H1N1 virus is causing," she said.</p>
<p>Thirty-nine per cent of hospitalizations are occurring in people aged 25 to 64; only seven per cent are occurring in the elderly.</p>
<p>"This is really, really different from what we see with seasonal flu," Schuchat said. Normally with seasonal flu, about 60 per cent of hospitalizations occur in people 65 and older. "Here we're only seeing about seven per cent of hospitalizations in this age group."</p>
<p>The data supports what others, including Canadian investigators, have found -- that H1N1 is disproportionately hitting the young.</p>
<p>Of 292 H1N1 deaths reported from 28 states since Sept. 1, about 24 per cent involved people under age 25. About 65 per cent of the deaths are in people 25 to 64.</p>
<p>Just 12 per cent of deaths from swine flu since Sept. 1 are occurring in seniors 65 and up.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a new model by Purdue University researchers predicts that there will be a significant wave of swine flu this fall, with 63 per cent of the American population being infected. The researchers say the wave will peak so early that the vaccination campaign now under way in the U.S. "will likely not have a large effect on the total number of people ultimately infected by the pandemic H1N1 influenza virus." Unlike Canada, the U.S. is reporting widespread flu-related illness nationwide.</p>

<p>Turkeys in a breeding barn owned by a Kitchener-based company are infected with the same strain of the H1N1 influenza virus that is circulating in humans.</p>
<p>Hybrid Turkeys voluntarily quarantined the barn housing the birds and provincial officials said in statements Tuesday that they pose little risk to the public.</p>
<p>Dr. Deb Stark, chief veterinarian for Ontario, said the facility doesn't produce turkeys or eggs for human consumption.</p>
<p>"We believe there is no significant public health risk," she said.</p>
<p>"We believe there is no food safety risk."</p>
<p>Stark said there are approximately 3,500 birds in the barn, although the company's manager of science and technology said there are about 3,000.</p>
<p>In an interview at Hybrid's Kitchener office, Dr. Helen Wojcinski said the virus is contained to one of two barns at the farm. The exact location has not been released.</p>
<p>In business since 1953, Hybrid is one of the largest primary turkey breeding companies in the world.</p>
<p>It has about 180 employees in Canada, the United States, France and Germany.</p>
<p>The company said it is working closely with government officials after noticing a significant reduction in egg production just before the Thanksgiving weekend, a symptom of an influenza infection.</p>
<p>The quarantine was imposed, and samples were sent away for testing. The virus was confirmed late Monday.</p>
<p>It's believed the virus was transmitted to the turkeys by humans in the barn.</p>
<p>A number of employees had cold-like symptoms before the drop-off in egg production, the only sign something was wrong with the hens.</p>
<p>"The other barn remains totally normal with respect to egg production," said Wojcinski, a veterinarian.</p>
<p>Strict biosecurity measures were already in place on the farm and between the two barns, she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Gatineau recruiting retirees for flu clinics</b>
</div><div>Dave Rogers   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>(From The Ottawa Citizen, October 22, 2009) The telephone number for anyone wanting to volunteer to help operate Gatineau's H1N1 flu vaccination clinics is 819-966-6188. An incorrect number appeared in a story on page A10 Wednesday.***** </p>
<p>Gatineau's health and social services agency is recruiting as many retired nurses and volunteers as it can get to help operate two H1N1 flu vaccination clinics up to 12 hours a day in November.</p>
<p>Renée Amyot, the health official responsible for H1N1 vaccinations, said the Centre de santé et de services sociaux de Gatineau needs 150 to 200 people a day to run two clinics serving the Aylmer, Hull and Gatineau sectors.</p>
<p>"We have our own employees but we also need active or retired nurses, secretaries, clerical staff and volunteers to run the two vaccination centres," Amyot said. "Everyone except the volunteers will be paid.</p>
<p>"The more people we have from outside for the clinics, the easier it will be to maintain other services. We won't refuse anyone who wants to help."</p>
<p>The agency runs the Gatineau and Hull hospitals, two nursing homes, pre-natal courses, social services and public medical clinics clinics.</p>
<p>Amyot said the agency needs retired nurses and volunteers because of a shortage of nurses in the Outaouais. Health officials say the clinics will be open for several weeks depending on demand.</p>
<p>About 100 Outaouais residents are ill with H1N1 this week compared to 87 last week. Fifteen have been hospitalized and one person has died from the virus in West Quebec since May.</p>
<p>Volunteers can register with the Gatineau agency by calling 819-966-6559 at any time or online at www.csssgatineau.qc.ca[http://www.csssgatineau.qc.ca].</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to help at two Papineau vaccination clinics in Val-des-Bois and Saint-André-Avellin east of Gatineau can call 819-966-9917 or register online at www.cssspapineau.qc.ca[http://www.cssspapineau.qc.ca].</p>
<p>Both health agencies will provide training and supervision for nurses, clerical staff and volunteers.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Number of H1N1 cases growing in Alberta</b>
</div><div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>264 words</div><div>21 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta is beginning to see an increase in the number of H1N1 influenza cases, the health minister said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"The incidence of the number of cases has certainly started to move upward," said Ron Liepert, who noted the severity of the disease has not changed. He said there have "a few situatuions" where H1N1was present in schools and other settings.</p>
<p>The Calgary Catholic School District, for instance, saw a few cases of H1N1 at a school before Thanksgiving, according to spokeswoman</p>
<p>Janet Sutherland. "We sent a letter home to parents but it seems to have run its course," she said.</p>
<p>Liepert's comments come as Alberta prepares to roll out a vaccine against the new virus in the coming weeks. The province received an undisclosed amount of vaccine from Ottawa and is waiting for Health Canada approval before administering the shots.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alberta Health Services is testing some seniors who live in a Calgary retirement home for an influenza-like illness--a little more than a week after a visit from Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Superboard officials they are testing 15 residents of Eau Claire Retirement Residence. Health officials said Tuesday results are not back on whether the illness is seasonal flu, H1N1 or another virus.</p>
<p>Officials with the Prime Minister's office said they are not concerned Harper may have been exposed to H1N1 during his visit. They said the facility ruled out swine flu. "Help is not too far away," added Andrew MacDougall, deputy press secretary for the Prime Minister's Office.</p>

</p>
<p>Plan B it was.</p>
<p>Had a seasonal flu bug not infiltrated the Oilers locker-room, the players would have reported to Rexall on Tuesday for some off-ice conditioning as well as an on-ice practice. It was one of the "hard work days" head coach Pat Quinn had on his schedule to ensure that the players kept up their fitness levels.</p>
<p>Instead, the players were told to take the day off and report for work on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ales Hemsky and Gilbert Brule were two of the players who have fallen ill over the last week.</p>
<p>"We think we have four, maybe five guys showing some stuff. It's all regular stuff (not H1N1) but we're taking as many precautions as we can," Quinn said after his team posted a 2-1 win over the Vancouver Canucks.</p>
<p>"We're going to have everybody stay at home, stay away from each other, to see if we can nullify anything that might be going around."</p>
<p>RACKING UP THE AIR MILES</p>
<p>Many a player who shifts from the Eastern Conference to the West, talks about the adjustments that need to be made when it comes to the travel. The Washington Capitals, for instance, are a three-hour drive from the home of the Pittsburgh Penguins, a two-hour jaunt to the <span class="companylink">Wachovia</span> Center in Philadelphia. In the air? In the air, it amounts to a fraction of the travel time the western teams log.</p>
<p>"In the Western Conference there's not a lot of time to train off ice which you need to maintain that level of fitness you need to compete hard," said associate coach Tom Renney.</p>
<p>"The travel is a lot more taxing. It's a lot different than zipping over to play the Devils or to the Island or a little one-hour flight to Pittsburgh or Buffalo. You just come home that night and practice the next day. When we go out, you almost need a day to recovery.</p>
<p>"Rest and recovery becomes a real big part of your seasonal plan."</p>
<p>OIL DROPS - There was no update available on RyanStonewhowastohaveanMRIon Tuesday. The gritty winger sustained a knee injury in the first period. - The penalty kill had another clean slate against the Canucks, going 5-for-5 on Monday night. On the flip side, the power play, obviously in need of Sheldon Souray's shot, has now gone two games without a goal.</p>

</p>
<p>Red and yellow leaves are falling from the trees as Karl Ayton makes his way to Grant MacEwan University for his morning organic chemistry course.</p>
<p>Coffee in hand, he takes a seat near the front of the room and opens his laptop computer just as the class begins.</p>
<p>But instead of focusing on a lecturer at the front of the room, Ayton's eyes drift upward where a giant video screen flicks on, showing the image of a professor 8,000 kilometres away in Germany. The scholar, considered to be a top expert in the field, gives a 30-minute talk to thousands of students around the world, all watching simultaneously through the satellite link-up.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the screen shuts down and Ayton joins a small group of students to discuss what they have just heard. Confused about one concept, they use their computers to click on to the course website, where a copy of the German professor's lecture has been uploaded, along with some animated diagrams.</p>
<p>Later, the MacEwan course supervisors give the next week's lab assignment, in which the students must visit a local biotech company to see how the curriculum is employed in a real-world industry. For the final project, Ayton will work with students from philosophy and business to design a plan for rolling out a new bio product--a plan that must include sound science, a marketing scheme and a strategy for mitigating ethical issues.</p>
<p>As you may have guessed, such a scenario does not yet exist. Ayton is a student in 2009, not 2029. But according to educational leaders, at least some of these proposed changes to the learning experience represent a plausible vision of the future.</p>
<p>Just how far it will go is a question of some discrepancy. After all, no one has a crystal ball capable of looking 20 years ahead. But administrators, professors and students tend to agree that a substantial transformation is already underway--a transformation that will feature more choice, more flexibility and more technology incorporated into Alberta's campus life.</p>
<p>"We are going through a revolution that, if you look back in time, the closest thing to it was 500 years ago with the invention of the printing press--it's that profound," says University of Alberta president Indira Samarasekera. "With the Internet, we haven't even scratched the surface."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One emerging trend in academia might be best labelled "smorgasbord-style," although it's also sometimes called self-directed or discovery learning. Essentially, the idea is to offer the curriculum in a variety of formats -- lectures, textbooks, PowerPoint slides, video of the professor, audio podcasts--and let the students discover for themselves how best to absorb the material.</p>
<p>"Every student learns a different way," says Beverly Eastham, vice-president (external) for the U of A Students' Union. "Some like traditional lectures. Others never want to go, but if you put that lecture on a podcast, they'll take it in."</p>
<p>Examples of this are already widespread. Many professors now post lecture notes and PowerPoint presentations online, while others provide some educational extras, such as sample exams or practice problems. In fact, professors who offer none of this digital-age content tend to be unpopular with students, even if they are exceptional orators.</p>
<p>"Students do hope for a prof who will put at least some stuff online. If they don't, you'll hear comments like 'Oh great, one of these guys,' " Ayton says.</p>
<p>"It's helpful to have access to that because then you're not forced to write down everything in a 40-minute lecture," adds MacEwan biology student Leah Elder. "We are the technology generation, so it's ingrained in us to use the Internet whenever possible. Around mid-terms, I'm on there (studying) all the time."</p>
<p>Recently, the U of A's medical school went further by creating a comprehensive, web-based platform called Homer, which has essentially wiped out the need for paper. Students can boot up their laptops and get all of their course materials electronically, from video clips showing how an X-ray analysis is done to coloured diagrams on limb fractures.</p>
<p>It's possible such a system could eventually become standard for all university-level programs, however some administrators remain skeptical of such a move. What works for highly motivated medical students may not work for all students, especially those in first and second year who may still need guidance with their learning habits, says University of Calgary provost Alan Harrison.</p>
<p>A smorgasbord-style approach may also be somewhat incompatible with liberal arts seminars such as history and English, which are based more on interpretation and discussion than facts. Others worry that a selection of electronic aids will convince students they can skip class entirely, although some professors get around this by uploading only portions of their material online.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>As part of its smorgasbord of features, Homer has been designed as a community-learning model because it encourages students and instructors to interact and teach others outside of class. The program allows students to create and upload their own learning aids, which are often done in fun and interesting ways, such as a rap video about antibiotic drugs. There's also a section for students to write their own practice exam questions and share answers, discussion forums, and learning games in which teams of students compete to solve puzzles about various diseases.</p>
<p>This kind of collaboration, including partnerships among scholars from different fields, is becoming one of the hallmarks of modern academia, Samarasekera says. The greatest discoveries are no longer made by lone researchers working away in a lab, but by interdisciplinary teams of scholars all bringing different perspectives toward solving a problem, she says.</p>
<p>As an example, the U of A has offered an experimental course on the oilsands, open to graduate students from any subject area, be it economics, engineering, sociology or native studies. The aim is to get young chemical engineers to see the oilsands in a way they have never considered before, through the eyes of someone more familiar with water laws or Aboriginal land claims, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Another course asks law students and English students to collectively examine legal issues raised in the works of Shakespeare. Another puts English and computer-science students together to design an adventure-style video game.</p>
<p>Should the trend continue, programs at the undergraduate level may involve less formal lecturing and more discussions and small-group activities.</p>
<p>The next step, Samarasekera says, is to boost collaboration not just among scholars from the same university or same province, but from around the world. Some of this has already started through international exchanges and partnerships, such as the deal the U of A just signed with the Indian Institute of Technology Bombay for joint research in energy and health.</p>
<p>Advanced Education and Technology Minister Doug Horner believes one more element should be brought increasingly into the learning community: the private sector. To solve big societal problems, businesses and academia must work together by sharing funding, facilities and knowledge, he says.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Beyond research projects, industry could contribute to students' learning experience in a variety of other ways: helping to develop portions of a program's curriculum, making facilities available for students to do lab work, arranging internships and field trips at company factories, and providing guest speakers.</p>
<p>All of this is an example of contextual learning, which moves knowledge beyond the theories and formulas discussed in the textbook and puts it in a real-world setting.</p>
<p>"The new learning experience is really about being interconnected with what's going on around the world," Horner says.</p>
<p>Collaboration with the industry is one way to foster contextual learning, but students could also do a joint research project with a nonprofit group in the inner city, sign up for field work in a developing nation, or spend time at a foreign university through an international exchange. Students say they like the trend, not only because it might reduce textbook time, but because it gives them first-hand experience on how the curriculum is relevant to their lives.</p>
<p>"It's active learning and engaged students," Samarasekera says. "So while the old model of professor-in-front-of-classroom dominated the 20th century, the new model is going to be platforms for students to engage in--whether it's in the classroom, on the web or elsewhere --but all guided by professors who design these platforms to allow students to emerge far more creative."</p>
<p>However, questions remain on just how far this learning model should go. In particular, the suggestion of more industry collaborations can raise fears of corporate influence in academia.</p>
<p>Horner notes such partnerships have already been adopted to some degree by certain programs--especially applied degrees and the trades. Less tested is the idea of businesses contributing to the learning experience of basic undergraduate courses such as anthropology, education or math.</p>

<p>Physical changes to the typical university classroom over the next 20 years are likely to be subtle, rather than revolutionary.</p>
<p>More technology is a given. Professors must have the ability to access content from the Internet quickly and reliably so it can be presented as part of their lectures. Satellite linkups with professors in other parts of the world will become more commonplace, so the technology must be good enough to allow students to interact with such scholars in real time.</p>
<p>Audio and video recordings of a professor's lecture must be of sufficient high quality so they can be understood when students later download them as podcasts or vodcasts from the course website. Students must have places to plug in their laptops so they can view course material while in class.</p>
<p>Classrooms will also have to become more versatile, administrators say. Future architecture must provide appropriate spaces for students to hold small group discussions, spaces to work on projects, and interdisciplinary spaces that can be used by students in the sciences, humanities or fine arts.</p>
<p>As an example, new lecture halls under construction at the U of C have the seats arranged in typical rows facing the front, but the seats also swivel 360 degrees, Harrison says.</p>
<p>"So you can immediately go from a large lecture format to forming small groups," he says. "There is a lot of value in that as a learning mechanism."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Professors in front of the classroom delivering lectures, I think, is going to be replaced by professors from around the country and the world being aggregated to deliver a lecture that can be accessed repetitively, while students engage in the classroom with a kind of guide-mentor," Samarasekera says.</p>
<p>As an example, she questions why the U of A, U of C and other western Canadian universities have to offer different versions of Physics 100.She believes the schools should look at combining their respective strengths to create one course offered at all the campuses. Using modern video technology, students would receive their lectures from the best teachers no matter which university they attend, she says.</p>
<p>"Why aren't my students being exposed to Nobel laureates in physics, while professors at the U of A, who are very good, can engage them in discussions?"</p>
<p>Samarasekera's idea may serve as an example of a controversial move toward the "professionalization" of teaching.</p>
<p>The concept suggests that the traditional dual role of a professor -- teacher and researcher--will be split. Scholars whose strength is research will spend less time in the classroom while their schools hire other scholars just for teaching duties.</p>
<p>"The idea that undergrads are going to get (in-person) access to people who do a lot of research, I think we're beyond that in 20 years," says Alex Usher of the Educational Policy Institute. "I think this notion that everyone teaches and everyone does research is financially untenable."</p>
<p>Usher believes this splitting of roles could have some benefits for students because they will be guided by people who are focused on the learning environment and can come up with creative ways of offering the material.</p>
<p>Others, however, see problems ahead.</p>
<p>In many ways, the professionalization of teaching is already underway, says James Turk of the Canadian Association of University Teachers.</p>
<p>As a cost-saving measure, universities are increasingly hiring part-time faculty or "sessionals" whose job is just to teach, he says. Compared with tenured or tenure-track faculty, sessionals are given few benefits: No office space to meet students after class, limited access to labs, and most importantly, no time or encouragement to do research, he says.</p>
<p>This ultimately degrades the learning experience for students because sessionals don't have the opportunity to make new discoveries and invest in the discipline they are teaching, Turk says.</p>
<p>"It's breaking the fundamental link that has been a distinguishing characteristic of universities, that you are both a searcher of knowledge and the disseminator of it."</p>
<p>The issue raises an even bigger question: Will technology ever expand to the point where traditional in-class lectures become obsolete? Will students of the future learn only at home through online courses?</p>
<p>Minister Horner believes there is room to expand Internet-based education. Many programs currently delivered in a traditional format could be offered entirely or partly online, he says.</p>
<p>It's unclear how quickly this will happen, although planning for an outbreak of the H1N1 flu may push ahead the adoption of new technologies, including more online programming, says Lisa Given, an associate professor of library and information studies at the U of A.</p>
<p>However, while digital expansion proceeds, almost no one believes there will be an end to traditional teaching.</p>
<p>"Increasingly, we are moving to larger classes, so technology is going to have to be an enabler, but it cannot replace personal contact," Harrison says.</p>
<p>"We are intensely social beings," adds Usher. "Just saying 'Here's a bunch of resources online,' that won't work. People learn through discussion and from hearing from the master, and I don't think technology is close to replicating that."</p>
<p>The biggest challenge, Horner says, may be getting the professors to stay ahead of the technology curve. This will be increasingly important because as the world's information becomes more accessible, there will be heightened difficulties in teaching students how to critically analyze what they find, he says.</p>
<p>"Instructors and professors are going to have to evolve from being imparters of knowledge to being facilitators of learning," he says. They are going to have to embrace new technology because these kids know it.</p>
<p>"And whether we like the twittering and texting, we have to be in a position to help them understand what's real and what's not.</p>
<p>"Being able to determine the truth of all that information out there is going to be critical to the success of Alberta students in the future."</p>

</p>
<p>Thank you, H1N1. I am a 51-year-old lady who just spent last weekend, all of last weekend in bed. Sick, I was.</p>
<p>I was raised by a single mother, whose motto was "You're not too sick" and was required to go to school every day (until I was sent home by the principal with mumps). I've entered my adulthood with much the same bravado.</p>
<p>Countless years have gone by with me dragging my germ-riddled self into the office and spreading around my malaise. All for the sake of the company.</p>
<p>But last Friday, my boss, after listening to my coughing through the walls for a short while, handed over some throat lozenges and the words we all should heed -- Go home and get well.</p>
<p>Before H1N1, we suffered through our illnesses without taking the time to get ourselves really better. I honestly can't remember a time when I wasn't out flat in my bed very ill or at work just barely getting by. But this time I am in bed, actually feeling depleted with a chest cold but reading a book and getting myself better a lot quicker than I normally would have.</p>
<p>So yes, thank you super strain for allowing me to heal myself the old-fashioned way, with rest and time.</p>
<p>Pam Ramsay,</p>

fears and fewer Canadian children of trick-or-treating age will make
this Halloween a ghost of its former self, with turnout expected to
be the lowest in 20 years. The economy will affect about one-third
of homes, while 36 per cent are concerned about H1N1. As well, the
latest Statistics Canada data show the pool of kids aged five to 14
is on track to hit a low not seen since 1990.

<p>Toronto</p>
<p>H1N1 expert catches</p>
<p>the illness himself</p>
<p>It's not the kind of H1N1 expertise a prominent Toronto doctor was hoping to bring to the table at an upcoming medical conference.</p>
<p>"It's not good, it's not good. Don't get it," Dr. Tom Stewart, chief of medicine and critical care expert at Mount Sinai Hospital, said while recovering from the flu virus at his home Tuesday.</p>
<p>Stewart is scheduled to be a moderator at an international conference on H1N1 in Toronto next week. He was diagnosed with the flu strain on Thursday, after a cold progressed to muscle aches, fever and exhaustion - symptoms he equated to "being hit by a truck."</p>
<p>He was treated with the antiviral Tamiflu drug and expected to be back at work Wednesday.</p>
<p>City police officer charged with assault</p>
<p>A Toronto Police constable is accused of assaulting a suspected car thief following an early morning pursuit, the Special Investigations Unit said.</p>
<p>The charge stems from an Aug. 5 incident in which 40-year-old David Graham was taken to hospital after he was arrested at Avenue and Davenport Rds., where he had crashed into a utility pole, the SIU said.</p>
<p>Const. Allan Racette is charged with assault "arising from an interaction with Mr. Graham during the arrest," an SIU release said.</p>
<p>Prostitution case</p>
<p>leads to man's arrest</p>
<p>Police arrested a 25-year-old Toronto man in connection with a prostitution investigation on Monday.</p>
<p>Police allege the man forced a woman into prostitution after posting her bail when she was charged with robbery.</p>
<p>Roman Huzo faces two charges for living on the avails of prostitution and exercising control over the woman.</p>
<p>He is scheduled to appear in court on Oct. 23 at 10 a.m.</p>

</p>
<p>A recent survey has found Manitobans believe the province is ready to deal with the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>While provincial health officials admitted Monday the latest phase of the H1N1 pandemic has begun, the survey Jory Capital-Probe Research Inc. survey found 72 per cent of Manitobans believes the province is equipped to deal with the outbreak.</p>
<p>The survey found that 15 per cent of respondents said the province is "very well prepared," and 57 per cent said the province is "somewhat well prepared."</p>
<p>But the survey found 25 per cent do not believe the province is ready -- 19 per cent of respondents said the province is "not very well prepared" and six per cent said the province is "not at all prepared."</p>
<p>Respondents said they are personally taking steps to protect themselves from contacting H1N1: 64 per cent are washing their hands more frequently; 25 per cent are using hand sanitizer to stop the spread of germs; 19 per cent are coughing or sneezing into their sleeves; 14 per cent are avoiding public places or large gatherings; and 8 per cent are staying home from work when sick.</p>
<p>The survey found that one per cent are taking more severe measures, such as refraining from shaking hands or wearing surgical masks and gloves.</p>
<p>What was asked</p>
<p>THE province-wide survey was conducted by Probe Research between Sept. 14 and Sept. 28, with telephone interviews of 1,000 adult Manitobans. It's considerate accurate to within 3.1 percentage points.</p>
<p>Respondents were asked the following questions:</p>
<p>"Recently, there has been a lot of discussion about the H1N1 virus, also known as the swine flu. Some people expect that many more Manitobans will come into contact with the H1N1 virus in the fall, when the flu season starts again. Based on what you have seen, read or heard, how well prepared would you say that Manitobans are to prevent the virus from spreading to one another during the next flu season?"</p>
<p>"Thinking about the time that has passed since the outbreak of the H1N1 virus, can you give me an examples of things you've done to avoid catching or possibly spreading the virus? Any other example?"</p>

<p>In light of the precautions that we are all being encouraged to exercise regarding the spread of H1N1, I would suggest that our places of worship follow these examples as well.</p>
<p>As far back as April, the Archdiocese of Phoenix distributed a directive to all of its parishes, suggesting the dispensing of "the sign of peace", this being the practice of shaking the hands of people near you. They also discontinued the practice of sharing the common communion cup. Lately, the Archdiocese of Edmonton made these same changes and took it one step further by removing the "blessed water" font from church entrances.</p>
<p>More recently a church in south Regina published these suggestions in their weekly bulletin as well as suggesting the changes from the pulpit. Why aren't all churches following this example, by working with health officials to help to prevent the spread of this disease?</p>

<p>Students too sick to attend classes at the University of Victoria have been told to stay home or confine themselves to their residence rooms.</p>
<p>Students are suffering symptoms similar to the H1N1 virus, and many are hitting the hay instead of hitting the books.</p>
<p>While the illness seems about as prevalent at UVic as it is in the community, the flu can spread quickly among the 2,400 students in residences.</p>
<p>The situation is bad and it's going to get worse, said UVic spokeswoman Patty Pitts.</p>
<p>"We're hearing that we're not peaking yet," Pitts said yesterday. "The prediction is the peak should be at the end of the month, the beginning of November or something like that."</p>
<p>The numbers of students currently sick is similar to what is seen at the peak of a normal flu outbreak, said Richard Piskor, UVic director of occupation health, safety and environment.</p>
<p>He wouldn't give estimates but suggested "a very significant number" of students will catch the bug.</p>
<p>Those who get sick feel better in less than a week and no one has been seriously ill, Piskor said. University health services see about 10 students each day.</p>
<p>"The illness is resolving in the course of five or six days," he said.</p>
<p>"We have students who are sick one week and by the next week, they're fine. Then we have another group of individuals who are ill," Piskor added.</p>
<p>In an effort to contain the flu, students in residence are receiving deliveries of Gatorade and "nutrition kits" containing soup, juice, crackers and Jell-O.</p>
<p>There are also "grab-and-go" meals available at the cafeteria for students to take back to sick peers in residence.</p>
<p>Students who suspect they're getting sick are asked to contact their instructors for instructions or online guidance. A doctor's note is required for students sick more than two weeks.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizer is available in residences and elsewhere. Students, faculty and staff who feel ill are urged to stay home, wash their hands frequently and minimize social contact.</p>

</div><div>Noor Javed </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>460 words</div><div>20 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>B05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>Wayne Bartels and his 4,500 hogs are out of the dark, for now.</p>
<p>The hog farmer met with creditors on Friday afternoon and they agreed to pay his outstanding hydro bill of $11,000 - helping him avert immediate closure of his 40-hectare farm just south of Hamilton.</p>
<p>For most of last week, Bartels' two hog barns had been running on power from backup diesel generators.</p>
<p>He feared the fuel would run out and he would be forced to shut down and ship his pigs elsewhere.</p>
<p>The 100-acre farm in York requires power to keep the ventilation system in the barn working, and for a computerized system to release feed to the livestock</p>
<p>Bartels met with Farm Credit, a Crown corporation that provides financing to farmers, to apply for a federal loan.</p>
<p>In the meantime, while his application is being processed, Farm Credit officials said they would offer him a lifeline to keep the farm alight and afloat.</p>
<p>"Farm credit promised the hydro company on Friday that they would wire the money to them on Monday," said Bartels. "That's probably what happened today, so they turned the power back on," he said.</p>
<p>It's a relief to have power, he admits, but hardly a solution to his long-term financial woes.</p>
<p>Bartels is one of many hog farms in the province who have been especially hard-hit this year by the recession, increasing cost of feed and fears around the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Bartels said he had been unable to pay his electricity bill since July.</p>
<p>"All of the farmers in Ontario, since H1N1 we have taken on so much debt that we are way beyond what would be an acceptable debt level," he said.</p>
<p>"We are loaded down with too much debt. The way it is right now, we are not going to have an industry left in Ontario."</p>
<p>Doug Curtiss, <span class="companylink">Haldimand County Hydro</span> interim president and CEO, said he hopes Bartels has his finances sorted out in time for the next billing cycle.</p>
<p>"We will be going through another billing cycle fairly soon, at which time we will issue him his normal power invoice," said Curtiss. "Hopefully by that time his business picks up, or he gets some funding from somewhere to help him out."</p>
<p>Bartels said he hasn't yet figured out how - or who - will cover next month's tab.</p>

</p>
<p>About 2 million doses of H1N1 vaccine have been distributed to the provinces and territories, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said yesterday, but it is still awaiting approval by Health Canada.</p>
<p>"As the vaccine rolls off the production line, it is being shipped to locations across the country," Aglukkaq told a news conference. "It will be released once it has completed the approval process, and that process is well under way," she said.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq said Health Canada, the regulating body for vaccines, is reviewing data and once the regulator is confident the vaccine is safe and effective, it will recommend to the minister that she authorize it for use.</p>
<p>The minister said that recommendation should come "soon," but a source told Canwest News Service the vaccine could be approved this week.</p>
<p>Pre-positioning the vaccine is part of good planning, Aglukkaq said, and will allow the process to move more quickly than if the vaccine was shipped out only after approval was given.</p>
<p>The federal government is responsible for getting the vaccine to the provinces and territories, which pass it on to local health authorities.</p>
<p>"This is the largest immunization campaign in history and so the logistics of getting that all together are tremendous," Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones said. He said good progress is being made, but there is till a lot of work to be done.</p>
<p>"We're confident that all of those pieces can be in place by the beginning of November," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Lachute - Even though the rising loonie has a multi-million-dollar effect on the bottom line of <span class="companylink">Cascades Inc</span>., the Quebec-based paper products producer says it doesn't need a currency "subsidy" to humble its U.S. competitors.</p>
<p>"Cascades is ready to compete with the dollar at par," CEO Alain Lemaire said in an interview after officially opening a $15-million expansion of its tissue paper plant here yesterday.</p>
<p>Every one-cent increase in the Canadian dollar takes a bite of between $4 million to $5 million from annual corporate profits "so we are not happy about that," said Lemaire, about the company that has become one of the largest paper recyclers and green paper producers in North America.</p>
<p>"But if we are efficient, if we have good infrastructure, if we have good equipment, we (should) be as good as them. Why do we need (currency) subsidies to be as good as our neighbour?"</p>
<p>Lemaire was perhaps buoyed by the formal christening of Cascades' new plant, which will increase its converting capacity by about 50 per cent, pumping out almost 3.4 million cases of paper hand towels and tissue papers for commercial and industrial clients.</p>
<p>He also was surely basking in the praise heaped upon his family and the company it founded by Premier Jean Charest, who attended the ceremony and proclaimed the Lemaires had a "gift of vision" that propelled them to the top tier of francophone businesses in Quebec.</p>
<p>Cascades also has impressed some analysts - and investors - with its second-quarter profit of $30 million, which was reported in mid-August as many other paper producers were struggling to maintain stability amid the economic downturn and slumping demand.</p>
<p>The Lachute expansion is poised to become the first new paper plant in North America to obtain LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification.</p>
<p>The 6,800-square-meter expansion also sees the replacement of five production lines by a single line that uses the latest technologies, the company said yesterday.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Investissement Québec</span> provided a loan of $3.1 million, while Emploi-Québec offered $379,000 to train employees on the new equipment.</p>
<p>The government and corporate investments in the paper plant secure about 160 jobs, Lemaire said.</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of the expansion is the prominent placement of three large stained glass windows, obviously religious in nature. They were among the salvaged - and restored - materials taken from the former St. Julien church in Lachute.</p>
<p>The nearby church, consecrated in 1936, had fallen into disrepair - its stone crumbling and with windows broken - and needed to be demolished, Suzanne Blanchet, CEO of Cascades' Tissue Group, said.</p>
<p>In exchange for the land, Cascades took down the church and used much of its stone and some artifacts, including a huge bell, in the plant expansion.</p>
<p>While the recession has seen the commercial demand for paper napkins drop, paper towels sales have increased, said Blanchet, who linked the increased demand to more hand-washing in a bid to avoid germs and the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The company has recently embarked on a publicity campaign promoting the use of paper towels instead of hot-air dryers, which, it says, have been shown to spread bacteria.</p>
<p>Headquartered in Kingsey Falls, Cascades employs about 13,000 people in North America and Europe.</p>

</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>Public-health officials are preparing to roll out the largest vaccination campaign in Canadian history in the coming weeks, but the public remains confused about the threat posed by H1N1 influenza and the benefits and risks of the vaccine. The Globe and Mail's Public Health Reporter, André Picard, tries to clear up the “conflusion” by answering reader questions.</p>
<p>I keep reading about an “epidemic” and a “pandemic,” which implies there is an imminent threat. But I just don't see an epidemic or pandemic out there, just a lot of fear-mongering.</p>
<p>Epidemic and pandemic are technical terms that refer to the geographical spread of a disease, not its severity. H1N1 is a pandemic because it has spread to virtually every country in the world since it first surfaced in humans in March. I've had the flu before. What's the big deal?</p>
<p>The “flu” has become a catch-all term but it is not a cold, or a gastrointestinal bug. Influenza (H1N1 or otherwise) is unpleasant and will put you out of commission for about a week: You suffer fever, coughing, chills, muscle aches and extreme fatigue; many people have trouble getting out of bed. The vast majority of those infected will get better with rest and plenty of fluids but, in some cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can result in hospitalization and death.</p>
<p>What kind of vaccine is there for H1N1?</p>
<p>In Canada, there are actually two versions of H1N1 vaccine: an adjuvanted vaccine that has the brand name Arepanrix and a vaccine without adjuvants. The Public Health Agency of Canada has ordered 50.4 million doses – enough for two doses for 75 per cent of the population. Inoculation campaigns will begin around the first week of November.</p>
<p>What's an adjuvant?</p>
<p>An adjuvant is a substance used to bolster the antigens in the vaccine – an adjuvant was used in the H1N1 vaccine because of fears that manufacturers would not be able to harvest sufficient stocks from eggs to make antigen. The adjuvanted vaccine, Arepanrix, contains 3.75 micrograms of antigen; the non-adjuvanted version has 15 micrograms of antigen.</p>
<p>H1N16</p>
<p>What's in the adjuvant?</p>
<p>Arepanrix, the product from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, Canada's sole provider of H1N1 vaccine, uses an adjuvant called AS03, which consists of squalene (shark liver oil), DL-alpha-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. There are claims that squalene, part of the adjuvant used in the anthrax vaccine, was to blame for Gulf War syndrome, but the evidence is weak.</p>
<p>This is a new, experimental vaccine. Has it been properly tested?</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine is not experimental. It is the same as past flu vaccines – except with a different antigen, of course – which have a good safety record. New versions of the flu vaccine do not require new human trials each year. The controversial aspect of Arepanrix is the adjuvant. While adjuvants have been used in vaccines for some time, AS03 has undergone limited safety testing. Health Canada insists that there have been no shortcuts taken in the approval process for the vaccine.</p>
<p>Is H1N1 vaccine safe?</p>
<p>Like every drug, the H1N1</p>
<p>vaccine has benefits and risks. The benefit is that it can prevent infection with swine flu – though the protection is not 100 per cent. The risks, for most people, are minimal, and include some redness and maybe a slight fever. But in rare cases, there can be serious complications such as Guillain-Barré syndrome. But those risks are not unique to this vaccine. Isn't there mercury in the vaccine?</p>
<p>Flu vaccine is packaged in vials that contain multiple doses; to avoid contamination, a mercury-based preservative called thimerosal is added. One dose of vaccine contains about 25 micrograms of mercury, slightly less than what you will ingest in a tuna sandwich. There are persistent claims that mercury in vaccines causes autism but this has been debunked.</p>
<p>Should children get the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>The vaccine is recommended for all Canadians over the age of six months, with few exceptions. However, it is recommended that children under the age of 10 get the vaccine in two doses instead of one. That is because children do not produce as strong an immune response to the antigen as adults do.</p>
<p>Should pregnant women get the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>Pregnant women, whose immune system is suppressed, are at highest risk of complications from the flu. Therefore, it is recommended that they be the first in line to get the H1N1 vaccine. However, it should be noted that the H1N1 vaccine that will be administered to pregnant women, which is packaged in single doses, contains neither thimerosal nor adjuvants.</p>
<p>Should I get the vaccine if I've already had the flu?</p>
<p>If you had a laboratory-confirmed case of H1N1, there is no need to be vaccinated. However, bear in mind that only about one-third of people who say they have had the flu actually had influenza.</p>
<p>If I get the vaccine can I still get the flu?</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines are not 100-per-cent effective so, yes, it is possible. However, chances are the symptoms will be more mild. Getting the H1N1 vaccine does not mean you will not get sick this winter; there are other strains of flu and numerous other viruses and bacteria that circulate.</p>
<p>How long can an infected person spread this virus to others?</p>
<p>People infected with the flu shed virus, and they can infect others from one day before getting sick and up to seven days after.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG</p>
<p>At a time when Canada is preparing to welcome the world at the Winter Olympics - with an elbow bump rather than a handshake - concern over H1N1 flu is prompting Canadians to forgo handshakes and hugs.</p>
<p>A Canadian Press-Harris Decima poll found roughly one-third of those surveyed said they were less inclined to shake hands because of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>More than half - 52 per cent - said someone had refused to shake hands or hug them because they were worried about spreading the virus.</p>
<p>The poll also suggested that almost two in three people had declined to touch others in the past for fear of passing on an illness.</p>
<p>Just over 1,000 Canadians were surveyed for the poll between Oct. 8 and Oct. 12. The poll has a margin of error of 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20.</p>

<p>YORK</p>
<p>Everyone is happy at Bartside Farms. Except for the pigs. They are back on schedule to die.</p>
<p>But Wayne and Geoff Bartels have received a stay of execution for their financially-troubled farm that had its hydro cut last week.</p>
<p>Haldimand County Hydro cut off power to the 40-hectare farm, located just south of Binbrook, because of an $11,000 unpaid bill.</p>
<p>But power was restored Friday at about 6 p.m. when the Bartels received an emergency loan for the owed amount from Farm Credit Canada, a federal loan agency.</p>
<p>The Bartels had been relying on two diesel-powered generators to run their ventilation system to keep their 4,500 pigs alive.</p>
<p>The Bartels are waiting word on several other FCC loans to push the farm back to some form of sustainability. But they say their problems are symptomatic of an ongoing crisis in the Ontario hog industry.</p>
<p>"The hog industry is loading itself up with debt and we're way beyond what values the farm is worth," Wayne Bartels said. "We're over-extended. The end of the month is crunch time again."</p>
<p>Ontario's 2,100 pork producers are reeling from soaring feed prices, a sluggish economy and H1N1 concerns.</p>
<p>As Ontario pork producers export much of their product to the U.S., the soaring loonie represents another blow to revenue, said Keith Robbins, a spokesperson for Ontario Pork, an association representing the province's hog farmers.</p>
<p>He said the U.S. policy of supporting corn for ethanol production means pork producers face high corn feed prices.</p>
<p>"In Ontario, farmers are facing the fourth year of depressed prices to the point they are not covering their actual cost of production. What that means is the cost to raise a pig, they aren't even getting that value.</p>
<p>"It is very strained," Robbins said, adding support programs to aid farmers through cyclical downturns were never designed for the long-term impacts the industry now faces.</p>
<p>Those factors saw the Bartels' farm go black Tuesday with the hydro cut-off. The various factors putting financial pressure on pork producers could mean there will soon be many fewer Ontario pig farms.</p>
<p>Then Ontario pork, subject to stringent Canadian food safety requirements, will become harder to find in grocery stores.</p>
<p>Geoff Bartels had expressed surprise the utility would cut power to the farm, which was three months in arrears.</p>
<p>"We're just three months late with the bill. That's not that bad ... We were just blown away that they did shut it off. We didn't think they would."</p>
<p>Doug Curtiss, Haldimand County Hydro interim president and CEO, admits the utility took some major heat from the public for disconnecting the Bartels' power.</p>
<p>"Disconnecting power for customers in arrears is unfortunately a normal part of our business. We treat everyone with the same minimal standards. We've taken calls and e-mails from concerned citizens. Most relate to the situation the farmers are in or the safety of the livestock on the farm."</p>

<p>Preparing for the Vancouver Canucks or the Columbus Blue Jackets is a rather straightword exercise.</p>
<p>Preparing for the H1NI virus?Not such a simple procedure.</p>
<p>Edmonton Oilers trainer Ken Lowe said the biggest headache he and his NHL peers face is that there's still a lot of mystery surrounding the virus.</p>
<p>"The trainers have talked. We've all said, 'What are we going to do?" said Lowe. "I don't think we know enough about it."</p>
<p>Players have been reminded to wash their hands and cough into their sleeves. If they come down with a fever and upper respiratory symptoms, they don't report to Lowe, which used to be the policy.</p>
<p>Now they head straight to the team doctor, which is route the Ales Hemsky took. The winger, who started to feel ill in Chicago last week, had a fever but none of the more typical H1N1 symptoms.</p>
<p>That wasn't the case in Columbus, where defenceman Mike Commodore, forward Kristian Huselius and trainer Mike Vogt were felled by a virus during training camp.</p>
<p>Tests were not done to confirm it was the swine flu, but all the symptoms pointed that way. (Testing is not done in some states. In Alberta, it is only performed in severe cases.)</p>
<p>"It was the worst six or seven days of my life," Huselius told the Columbus Dispatch when he finally made it back. "I was going back and forth between the sweats and chills," Commodore said.</p>
<p>"I got out of bed, wrapped myself in towels because I was freezing, and kicked the door open. Unfortunately, I ended up walking right into it and cutting my head open."</p>
<p>The Oilers had their annual fall flu shots following Monday's game and the medical staff will push to get the players vaccinated for H1N1 when it is available.</p>
<p>In the meantime, they are also receiving regular reminders to use the sanitizers before and after a workout in the weight room at Rexall Place. The junior Oil Kings got the same message.</p>
<p>Another benefit, said Lowe, is that the use of the sanitizers will also help alleviate the potential spread of the Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, as it is more commonly known.</p>
<p>"For the first time we educated (the players)at training camp," said Lowe. "I told them I wanted them to wash their hands going into the weight room and coming out. Towels? Never use someone else's towel. You shouldn't be, anyway."</p>
<p>Dr. Dhiren Naidu also spoke to the players about the virus and how it was spread.</p>
<p>"You do think about it, (but) the symptoms for the swine flu were a little different," said Hemsky, who was pressed into service Monday night when Gilbert Brule fell ill after the morning skate. Hemksy had missed Friday's game against the Minnesota Wild. jireland@the journal. canwest.com</p>

<p>Re: "Give Olympians vaccine first: doctor; H1N1 flu could devastate athletes, he says," The Journal, Oct. 14.</p>
<p>Bob McCormack, chief medical officer for Canada's Olympic team, says the Olympics are a potential breeding ground for the H1N1 virus and that justifies making athletes a priority for the vaccine.</p>
<p>The Olympics don't start until February and the vaccine will be given in November. It only takes a few weeks to build immunity, so even if the athletes got it in December, they will be well protected by the time the Olympics start.</p>
<p>This is a global pandemic and nearly every country will be offering the vaccine. The Canadian Olympic Association could pay to access the vaccine in another country or fly the athletes home to get it.</p>
<p>Our Olympic athletes are some of the healthiest people in Canada. I doubt they would die from the virus, unlike other at-risk Canadians.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I think the average Canadian's attitude might be similar to McCormack's. It would be sad to see young, healthy adults given priority over pregnant women, seniors, and children, who were encouraged to be the first immunized. Health Canada says there will be enough vaccine for everyone.</p>
<p>So, Mr. and Mrs. Average Canadian, keep washing your hand, cough into your sleeve, take a few deep breaths and wait your turn.</p>

</p>
<p>The letter sent home with students in the Vancouver school district might have been worded more carefully, but the essential message was both crucial and on the mark.</p>
<p>The letter warned that H1N1, or swine flu, is circulating widely in Vancouver and has been showing up in schools.</p>
<p>It said that if a child, family members, friends or co-workers have flu symptoms -- a cough, fever and muscle aches -- "it is certainly due to H1N1 flu virus at this time."</p>
<p>At least one parent has raised a legitimate concern that such a blanket diagnosis may not be correct in every case and that such symptoms may not even be related to a flu virus.</p>
<p>It would have been better, as a spokesman for the BC Centre for Disease Control confirmed, to have said "almost certain" to be H1N1.</p>
<p>That said, the distinction should be moot for parents who pay attention to the advice that went along with the diagnosis.</p>
<p>What is unchallenged here is that an abnormally large number of flu cases is showing up in B.C., at a much higher rate than the other Canadian provinces and well ahead of the normal flu season. Although there are other flu strains showing up elsewhere in the world, some of which are included in the "seasonal" flu vaccine that is available now, the vast majority of those tested here are being confirmed as H1N1.</p>
<p>We also know that unless it changes character, for most people, the H1N1 flu, while miserable, will not be serious.</p>
<p>For some people, however, it can be. As the letter to parents indicates, pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, heart or lung disease and a weak immune system can turn H1N1 flu into a life-threatening encounter.</p>
<p>Parents of children who have such conditions are urged to see their doctors now to make a flu plan so they can get anti-viral drugs quickly when flu strikes.</p>
<p>But there have been and likely will be cases in which people who have no apparent pre-existing conditions fall seriously ill.</p>
<p>So as with any illness, parents must monitor their child's symptoms and take appropriate action. For H1N1, that will usually mean keeping the child home home until he or she is well enough to return to school.</p>
<p>Parents will naturally worry, however, that what their child is experiencing is one of those rare cases in which the flu -- or whatever they have been stricken with -- is more serious.</p>
<p>If so, no one should hesitate to seek medical advice, starting with 811, the provincial health information phone line.</p>
<p>It may not be H1N1, or even another seasonal flu. Even so, the advice for parents is the same -- get medical help if you think you need it.</p>
<p>As well, all parents should be talking to their children about the need to protect themselves and others with frequent hand-washing and coughing or sneezing into their elbows.</p>
<p>They should also be thinking about getting the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available over the next few weeks.</p>
<p>As the letter home correctly pointed out, the vaccine will be the best protection against this flu and the sooner it is administered, the better.</p>

<p>Despite warnings of an impending H1N1 pandemic, eight out of 10 small businesses say preparing for severe disruptions to their operations is not a high priority, according to a recent survey.</p>
<p>Small-business owners are aware that they face risks to the continuity of their operations – 40 per cent surveyed said they had endured significant disruptions in the past – but twice that number put preparing for problems low on their to-do list or said it was not even on their radar screens, says Howard Grosfield, vice-president and general manager of small business services with American Express Canada and International.</p>
<p>“They are so fundamentally focused on growing their business that it becomes increasingly challenging for them to find the time and, more importantly, to allocate a portion of resources and/or investments towards managing for disruptions,” he says.</p>
<p>Small-business owners have finite resources and it's difficult for them to pull away from revenue generation to dedicate some of their limited time or money on something that might happen.</p>
<p>Money was cited by 35 per cent as a hindrance to developing a plan, while a third of respondents said finding time was a struggle. Almost half of the businesses, 49 per cent, don't have fire and flood insurance.</p>
<p>That's according to the survey conducted by Angus Reid Strategies for <span class="companylink">American Express</span>. A total of 504 Canadian businesses with between two and 100 employees took part. The margin of error is plus or minus 4.4 per cent.</p>
<p>Mr. Grosfield advises businesses to think about potential disruptions and include some methods for dealing with them in their business plans.</p>
<p>Some things can be done that do not require much time or money. Business owners should talk to staff about things such as an outbreak of flu and decide who can do what to help.</p>
<p>“You don't have to solve all the risks that you think are sitting out there, but understanding what they are and then making decisions about which ones you are going to protect yourselves against versus those that you are not is half the battle.”</p>
<p>Lauren Gervais of Winnipeg market-research company Data Probe, is one of those business owners who does have insurance. She was glad of that last year.</p>
<p>“We bought a building and gutted it and moved the company into it and, about six months later one of the pipes by the toilet … erupted. Of course it happened during the night, so for probably a good eight hours we had a three-foot geyser of water shooting out of a washroom on the top floor and it flowed down a staircase, down the walls into the ceiling above the call centre, collapsed the ceiling, rained on the computers and then into the basement. … It was pretty catastrophic.”</p>
<p>The company was able to sub-contract out some of its work, which meant a drop in income. Insurance paid for new computers and other equipment, but Data Probe was operating at about half capacity for about six months.</p>
<p>“I treat my company … like my home,” she says now. “I wouldn't be in my home without insurance.”</p>

<p>I have some excellent news for people with no social skills and really poor personal hygiene.</p>
<p>The next time we meet -- even if we are REALLY EXCITED about seeing one another -- we don't have to bother shaking hands. And forget hugging, kissing, rubbing noses or anything else that may involve inadvertently exchanging bodily fluids.</p>
<p>I base this on a Canadian Press story I've just read stating Canadians are willing to give up handshakes and hugs because of concerns over H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>According to this story, a Harris Decima survey of 1,000 Canadians found roughly one-third were less inclined to shake hands because of the H1N1 virus and more than half -- 52 per cent -- said someone had refused to shake hands or hug them because of flu fears.</p>
<p>Discussion Question: Isn't it sad when a little thing like a potentially deadly virus causes us to forgo a social tradition that has survived for centuries?</p>
<p>Answer: No, it's not! In fact, it's a great idea. I'm not being insensitive here. I realize some guys are going to have a hard time giving up handshakes.</p>
<p>For women, it's not as big a deal. Women have a wide variety of options when greeting someone, such as the "air kiss," wherein the greeter purses their lips together like a carp in mid-air and then makes an annoying smacking noise in the other person's ear.</p>
<p>So some women may not relate to the demise of the handshake, just as some men cannot relate to the concept of not wearing white shoes after Labour Day or attending a party wherein the only thing anyone does for fun is buy scented candles. But for guys, the handshake is a tradition dating back to caveman times, when an open hand signified you weren't about to cave in another guy's head with a mastodon bone.</p>
<p>For most guys -- especially if they happen to be the prime minister of Canada -- shaking hands is as far as you are willing to go in terms of public displays of affection. Persons of my gender have a strict code handed down by their fathers, wherein a handshake is one of the few accepted ways of showing affection for another guy, along with:</p>
<p>1) Insulting his golf swing;</p>
<p>2) Insulting his new propane barbecue;</p>
<p>3) Questioning his masculinity or personal hygiene habits;</p>
<p>4) Letting him use your TV remote control;</p>
<p>5) Spitting.</p>
<p>Especially that last one. If we, as a society, are going to be serious about outlawing handshakes, then we are also going to have do something about spitting, which basically means we will have to ban professional sports altogether, especially baseball, a sport where the rules of the game require players to chew smokeless tobacco and spit at least 30 times per second while on national TV, meaning if you look in the dugout of any Major League team during the ninth inning, all you'll see is a huge, burbling pool of brown drool.</p>
<p>But that's not my point. My point is waving farewell to handshakes is a swell idea. I say this because shaking hands has always been far too complicated. If you do a <span class="companylink">Google</span> search for "how to shake hands," you get roughly 12,800,000 hits, including websites offering technical tips, such as these from eHow:</p>
<p>1) Extend your right hand to meet the other person's hand;</p>
<p>2) Point your thumb upward toward the other person's arm and extend your arm at a slight downward angle.</p>
<p>How can we expect ANYONE to perform a task this complex? (Hint: We can't!) The mind of a typical guy becomes flooded with troubling questions when thrust into a handshaking situation: What if the other guy grabs my fingers? What if I grab his fingers? What if he squeezes my hand with enough force to turn coal into diamonds? What if he doesn't let go in two or three seconds? If he pumps my hand more than three times, does it mean he wants to dance? If so, who leads?</p>
<p>Then there's the dilemma of what kind of handshake are they looking for in the first place? A lot of innocent guys have been injured sticking out their hand, only to discover at the last second the other guy is coming in for a fist bump.</p>
<p>I can't even begin to describe, using mere words, how awkward it is when you attempt a high-five only to have the other guy come underneath for a low-five, but I will try: It's very, very awkward.</p>
<p>All in all, H1N1 or not, it's best for everyone concerned if we give up shaking hands altogether. Better we do what Olympic organizers are suggesting: Just bump elbows.</p>
<p>So make it an elbow bump for me. I do NOT need someone squeezing my hand to make me feel welcome. I'm a modern, self-confident guy. I'm an island.</p>
<p>Please, someone, I need a hug!</p>

<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Mass flu-shot clinics being set up across the country; Two million doses of H1N1 vaccine shipped to provinces</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO   </div>
<div>770 words</div><div>20 October 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Canada is preparing for its largest vaccination campaign ever by setting up mass H1N1 clinics across the country: At least 300 will be set up in Toronto; schools and community centres on Vancouver Island are on standby for extra space; and Cape Breton, N.S., has padded its health ranks with more nurses.</p>
<p>Two million doses of the swine flu vaccine have been shipped to provinces and territories, and more will arrive every week. Canada has ordered 50-million doses from pharmaceutical giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>Local health districts in big cities and small towns are wrapping up administering seasonal flu shots to the elderly. They now await the final sign-off from Health Canada, expected this week, before embarking on the biggest public health logistical challenge.</p>
<p>The hope: Not everyone will rush to be vaccinated in the first few days. The plan: All who want the vaccine should be inoculated in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>The sense of urgency around being immunized is heightened as the H1N1 virus spreads quickly in places like British Columbia and the Northwest Territories. Kami Kandola, NWT's chief public health officer, said people could be offered the vaccine as early as Monday if Ottawa gives the green light this week. The territory has received 34,000 doses of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, jurisdictions are putting the final touches on their vaccination strategies and plan to start running clinics later this month or in early November.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>VANCOUVER ISLAND</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority has secured 12 locations on the island to administer the vaccine, and is also negotiating with schools and community centres if more space is needed.</p>
<p>Richard Stanwick, chief medical health officer, said the logistics of running such a massive vaccine campaign are challenging, but officials have tried to anticipate difficulties.</p>
<p>“We've been doing a lot of planning. And again thanks to bird flu, we had anticipated this issue. The only thing will be getting this [the vaccine] out. There will be some nuances,” Dr. Stanwick said.</p>
<p>If clinics start seeing large lineups (there are about 770,000 people on the Island), retired staff could be brought back or the health district is prepared to redeploy health care workers.</p>
<p>Adding more locations is also in the cards.</p>
<p>“This wouldn't be novel. But it would be doing something more on an urgent basis, rather than on an orderly basis,” Dr. Stanwick said.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health usually runs about 65 seasonal flu vaccination clinics. But the H1N1 vaccine is targeted for all age groups, which means the health district has widened its reach and plans to run 300 clinics at 10 locations around the city, in civic centres, schools and close to public transportation.</p>
<p>The first batches of vaccine will be sent to hospitals and will be used to immunize health-care workers. Clinics will get off the ground shortly after, and information will likely be posted on public health's website on which clinics have longer wait times.</p>
<p>“We're planning the clinics in a way that they can be scaled up or down. We can run one shift, or two shifts. We can run five days a week, six days a week, seven if absolutely necessary,” said Barbara Yaffe, the city's director of communicable disease control and associate medical officer of health. “We're going to try and be flexible.”</p>
<p>Based on projections, the plan is to vaccinate 1.2 million people over six weeks.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>CAPE BRETON</p>
<p>The Cape Breton District Health Authority in Nova Scotia has hired an additional 40 nurses to help run 20 immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Making the clinics accessible to all has been a challenge given that the district has a mix of 130,000 urban and rural residents.</p>
<p>Posters will be placed in communities and church bulletins will have notices to remind people where they can get immunized. Large halls have been booked so that no one will be turned away. Spokesman Greg Boone said fears that young people generally shy away from vaccines prompted the health unit to put two clinics at the local university and college.</p>
<p>“The planning has been going on, and we've been moving in the direction to be as prepared as possible when the approval comes,” Mr. Boone said.</p>
<p>South Shore Health, also in Nova Scotia, has postponed a health program for mothers and babies until after the vaccination campaign so that health care workers can be freed up to run clinics.</p>

</p>
<p>Throughout the world, high-risk groups have been placed at the front of the queue for H1N1 vaccinations. This is true, for example, in the United Kingdom, where priority groups, including pregnant women and everyone in at-risk groups over the age of six months, have been given priority. But in Canada, high-risk groups, including pregnant women and children under three, will have to wait longer to receive vaccination for H1N1, perhaps several weeks longer – nobody can say for sure – than members of the general public. This defies logic and indeed suggests a degree of bumbling by federal health authorities that is unacceptable.</p>
<p>The explanation offered is that, while the general public will receive a vaccine that includes chemical adjuvant to boost the vaccine's power, vulnerable groups – most notably pregnant women – are being offered vaccine without adjuvant. This is being done as a precaution, as there are no clinical data about the effects of adjuvant on expectant mothers. In July, the World Health Organization recommended pregnant women receive the non-adjuvanted vaccine where possible, and Canadian health officials agreed.</p>
<p>In other words, pregnant mothers and others at high risk can receive the regular vaccine, but they were effectively told the adjuvant-free vaccine is preferred, and were implicitly been advised to wait. In recent weeks, public health officials have issued contradictory statements on the matter, further complicating the issue.</p>
<p>The problem is that the government, though it has known at least since July of the need to arrange for a supply of non-adjuvanted vaccine, failed to acquire it ahead of the main variety.</p>
<p>While vaccine with the adjuvant has started to be shipped to the provinces and could be available for the general public by the end of October, David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, could not say on Monday when non-adjuvanted vaccine would be rolled out.</p>
<p>Expeditiousness has not been a hallmark of Canada's H1N1 strategy. The vaccine is already available in the United States and in other countries, but not in Canada. It took Canada several months longer than the U.S. even to decide who fit the description of a “high-risk” group. The delay in non-adjuvanted vaccine, however, is a serious failure on the part of the Public Health Agency, one that could have a terrible cost if pregnant women are exposed to H1N1 in coming weeks, while waiting for their government to get its act together.</p>

<p>ASIA</p>
<p>PAKISTAN TRIES FOR QUICK VICTORY</p>
<p>Peshawar Pakistani forces launched a massive aerial bombardment on Taliban strongholds Monday in an attempt to score a rapid victory in South Waziristan.</p>
<p>Army officers said their strategy was to use fighter jets and helicopter gunships to defeat the militants within two weeks. They said they hoped to use overwhelming force to ensure the campaign did not drift into the winter or turn into a drawn-out guerrilla war.</p>
<p>The army said 16,000 civilians had escaped the bombing but 12 villagers were killed.</p>
<p>A spokesman said 78 militants had been killed.</p>
<p>CENTRAL AMERICA</p>
<p>HURRICANE RICK CLAIMS FIRST VICTIM</p>
<p>LA PAZ - Hurricane Rick has claimed its first victim as it churned northward along Mexico's Pacific Coast, whipping up a giant wave that swept away a man at the Los Cabos tourist resort, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>The 38-year-old, Miguel Barraza, "was devoured by fierce waves and we couldn't do anything to save his life," said the head of Mexican rescue services, Francisco Cota Marquez.</p>
<p>Marquez added that the death occurred on Sunday.</p>
<p>Rick packed sustained winds of 185 kilometres per hour on Monday, down from 300 kilometres per hour on Saturday, according to the United States National Hurricane Center.</p>
<p>The hurricane centre has downgraded the storm from a top category five to category three.</p>
<p>However, forecasters predict that Rick will pick up speed as it moves toward the northeast, with the centre of the hurricane arriving at southern Baja California late today or early Wednesday.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>BRITISH MD GUILTY OF POISONING LOVER</p>
<p>LONDON - A doctor was found guilty Monday of trying to spike his pregnant lover's drinks with pills in a failed bid to abort their unborn child.</p>
<p>Dr. Edward Erin, 44, put a potentially lethal combination of crushed up drugs into coffee and orange juice which he then served to Bella Prowse.</p>
<p>Erin, who is married, had an affair with Prowse, 33, a secretary at his leading London hospital.</p>
<p>Prowse gave birth to a healthy baby boy in 2008.</p>
<p>Erin, who lives in the tony Kensington district, was found guilty of two charges of attempting to administer poison with intent to procure a miscarriage at the Old Bailey courthouse.</p>
<p>Asked if he had ever loved Prowse, Erin said: "It depends on how you define love. I had very strong emotions for her," while admitting telling her that he "did not want to have a child with her at that time."</p>
<p>Erin will be sentenced in November. The judge said a jail term is inevitable.</p>
<p>LONG-LOST DA VINCI MAY BE FOUND</p>
<p>FLORENCE - It sounds like a cross between a Dan Brown novel and an Indiana Jones adventure.</p>
<p>An Italian art expert claims to be on the verge of discovering a long-lost Leonardo da Vinci masterpiece hidden in a secret cavity behind a palace wall.</p>
<p>Maurizio Seracini, a university professor, believes that a cryptic message in a huge artwork in Florence's Palazzo Vecchio suggests Leonardo's The Battle of Anghiari is concealed beneath.</p>
<p>He believes it was painted over with the fresco -- The Battle of Marciano in the Chiana Valley -- by Giorgio Vasari, another Renaissance artist, in 1563. Prof. Seracini believes he left a clue to what was beneath by depicting a military banner that bears the words "Circa Trova" -- seek and you will find.</p>
<p>After years of detective work, Prof. Seracini has finally been granted permission to investigate what lies beneath. Florence's new mayor, Matteo Renzi, 34, is supporting the endeavour and wants to see the project realized as soon as possible.</p>
<p>FIRST SWINE FLU DEATH IN ICELAND</p>
<p>REYKJAVIK - Iceland reported its first death from swine flu on Monday, an 18-year-old girl with severe disabilities, health authorities in the country said.</p>
<p>"An 18-year-old disabled girl died this morning at the Hringur Children's Hospital due to the influenza H1N1," the country's chief epidemiologist said in a statement.</p>
<p>The girl became ill 11 days ago and was hospitalized on Thursday.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has killed at least 4,735 people since it was first reported in April in Mexico, according to a WHO tally.</p>
<p>Most deaths occurred in the Americas, where 3,406 fatalities have been reported.</p>
<p>EU URGES BOSNIA TO MAKE REFORMS</p>
<p>SARAJEVO - European Union Enlargement Commissioner Olli Rehn urged Bosnian leaders on Monday to reach an agreement on key reforms at a forthcoming meeting with EU and U.S. officials.</p>
<p>"This is absolutely essential and crucial to achieve concrete results ... on Tuesday and Wednesday," Rehn told reporters after meeting with Bosnian Prime Minister Nikola Spiric.</p>
<p>Rehn expressed hope that "we can achieve a political agreement which will facilitate Bosnia-Herzegovina to move forward toward a credible application for EU membership."</p>
<p>Bosnia's Croat, Muslim and Serb leaders are to meet with EU and U.S. representatives today in Sarajevo in a second round of talks on reforming the country's constitution and unblocking a long-lasting political stalemate.</p>
<p>They first met in Sarajevo on Oct. 9, but the meeting ended without a deal being reached.</p>
<p>ALGERIAN EVADES TORTURE INQUIRY</p>
<p>GENEVA - A former Algerian government minister has evaded questioning in Switzerland over torture allegations, a human rights group said on Monday.</p>
<p>Bouguerra Soltani, who is now the leader of an Algerian Islamist party, the Movement for the Society of Peace, is accused of directing the torture of a critic in 2005.</p>
<p>The Swiss campaign group Track Impunity Always (Trial) filed charges against Soltani in Fribourg on Oct. 12 after learning he was to visit the town for a conference.</p>
<p>Philip Grant, the president of Trial, said Soltani was expected in Fribourg on Saturday, but the authorities had been unable to find him.</p>
<p>"We are not absolutely sure Bouguerra Soltani has fled Switzerland. He didn't come to Fribourg as expected on Saturday, though he was in Geneva on Friday, so something stopped him or persuaded him not to come," Grant said.</p>
<p>SARKOZY'S LAWYER ACCUSES EX-PM</p>
<p>PARIS - Nicolas Sarkozy's lawyer accused former prime minister Dominique de Villepin on Monday of being the prime instigator of a sinister plot to smear the French president before he won election in 2007.</p>
<p>The trial of Villepin and four others entered its final week with Thierry Herzog addressing judges on behalf of the president before closing arguments by the defence and the prosecution in the month-long hearings.</p>
<p>"There is not just a strong belief but also indisputable evidence showing that Mr. de Villepin was the instigator, was at the origin in 2004, of this conspiracy," Herzog told the Paris criminal court.</p>
<p>The plot was aimed at "preventing Mr. Sarkozy from becoming the leader of the UMP" right-wing governing party and succeeding then-president Jacques Chirac, he said during a nearly four-hour argument.</p>
<p>Dressed in a black robe, the burly bespectacled Herzog said he was convinced that Villepin "colluded and agreed" with two co-defendants to discredit Sarkozy with falsified documents linking him to a corruption scandal.</p>
<p>SKEPTICS QUESTION BLAIR EU CANDIDACY</p>
<p>VIENNA - Austria and Belgium on Monday took a skeptical view towards former British prime minister Tony Blair becoming the European Union's first president, a key post set up by the Lisbon reform treaty.</p>
<p>Talks inside the 27-nation EU on how to divide up new responsibilities once the Lisbon treaty has been adopted by all countries "raise more questions than answers," visiting Belgian Prime Minister Hermann van Rompuy said.</p>
<p>Speaking at a press conference after talks with van Rompuy, Austrian Chancellor Werner Faymann said he was "skeptical about Mr. Blair."</p>
<p>Van Rompuy began a tour of EU capitals in Vienna Monday before Belgium takes over the rotating presidency of the European Union on July 1 next year.</p>
<p>Blair's possible candidacy for the post prompted French President Nicolas Sarkozy to warn Friday that Britain's refusal to join the euro currency would be a "problem" for the former prime minister's chances.</p>
<p>ANTI-RACISM GROUP CHALLENGES POLICE</p>
<p>PARIS - Anti-racism campaigners said on Monday they would file suit before a top French court over a new police database that would log details on their citizens' "geographic origin."</p>
<p>President Nicolas Sarkozy's government on Sunday announced the creation of a database aimed at preventing gang violence and hooliganism and another to log details of applicants for sensitive jobs, from airports to nuclear plants.</p>
<p>Created by government decree, the police files are to replace a contested database that was scrapped last year after outrage over plans to collate data on citizens' political views, sexual preferences and ethnic origin.</p>
<p>But SOS Racism said it would challenge the new anti-crime database this week before the State Council, France's highest administrative court, arguing that to log a person's place of origin would still amount to racial profiling.</p>
<p>It said the "vague" notion of geographic origin could be used to "stigmatize people based on their presumed origin."</p>
<p>AFRICA</p>
<p>NIGERIAN CHIEF ASKS FOR EX-REBEL'S AID</p>
<p>ABUJA - Nigeria's president will soon meet former rebel leader Henry Okah to seek advice on dealing with the OPEC member's main militant group which has threatened to resume oil attacks, a government source said on Monday.</p>
<p>Many believe Okah, who was freed from detention in July after accepting a federal amnesty offer, was at one time the brains behind the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and its attacks that have battered Africa's biggest energy producer for the last three years.</p>
<p>Okah denied ever being MEND's leader in an interview with Reuters in July.</p>
<p>"The reason why the president is meeting him is because of the reaction of these people who call themselves MEND, who are threatening to start attacking oil installations," a presidency source told Reuters.</p>

</p>
<p>An event set to bring together Asian investors and Canadian First Nations leaders in Saskatoon this week has been cancelled due in part to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Organizers of The Chinese-Indian Nations Exposition, or CHINEX2009, said Monday the event, which was set to run from Monday through Thursday, has now been moved to April 2010 after Chinese delegates were unable to attend due to H1N1 and subsequent travel visa problems. At the Asian delegates' request, the event will be held April 25-28 at TCU Place.</p>
<p>The event, co-sponsored by the Beardy's and Okemasis First Nation and the Pheasant Rump Nakota First Nation, has attracted interest from Canadian First Nations from British Columbia to Ontario.</p>
<p>Organizers say by 2050, China is set to be the world's No. 1 economy by GDP.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal --</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has begun to spread in earnest and the high-profile death of a 13-year-old Toronto boy has awakened the public to the potential dangers of the virus. Many readers are worried and looking for clear information about the threat posed by H1N1 influenza. The Globe and Mail's public health reporter, André Picard, tries to clear up the “conflusion” by answering reader questions. Mr. Picard has also answered your questions on the vaccine and questions from parents abouttreatment for children.</p>
<p>Please note that this information is not medical advice. Rather, it is an attempt to synthesize and explain in plain language information from public health officials and medical experts.</p>
<p>Question: What's the difference between H1N1 flu and the seasonal flu?</p>
<p>Answer: The formal name for the strain that has captured our attention is influenza A/H1N1/California (H1N1 or swine flu for short). Various strains of influenza circulate every year; they are usually mutated forms of earlier flu bugs, meaning many people have full or partial immunity. H1N1 is different – it jumped directly from animals to humans. That means it has the potential to infect and sicken a lot more people.</p>
<p>Q: It’s called swine flu. Does that mean we get it from pigs?</p>
<p>A: Many animals and birds get the flu, but those strains do not usually pose a threat to humans. At some point earlier this year H1N1 jumped from a pig to a human. But the virus now has nothing to do with pigs; it spreads human-to-human. Early on, the virus was dubbed swine flu because it resembled a strain that circulates in pigs. Genetic testing later showed that swine flu actually is a mixture of two types of swine flu, an avian flu and a human flu.</p>
<p>Q: What do the all the letters in influenza A H1N1 stand for?</p>
<p>A: There are three types of influenza viruses: A, B, and C. Only type A influenza can cause a pandemic and it causes the most serious illness in humans. Influenza A viruses are classified by two proteins on their surface: H for hemagglutinin and N for neuraminidase. There are 16 H subtypes: H1, H2 and H3 are found in human influenza viruses. There are at least nine subtypes of neuraminidase; N1 and N2 are associated with humans. Influenza B can cause epidemics but not pandemics; it causes illness, but tends to be less deadly. Influenza C causes mild illness.</p>
<p>Q: So what are my odds of getting the flu?</p>
<p>A: In an average year, 10 to 20 per cent of Canadians get sick with the flu. With a pandemic strain like H1N1, that number could jump to 30 to 50 per cent. According to mathematical modelling done as part of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan, a new strain could kill between 11,000 and 58,000 Canadians in a period of six to eight weeks. It could also result in the hospitalization of 35,000 to 138,000 people and leave 4.5 million to 10.6 million others too sick to work, which would have a devastating economic impact. But that’s a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Q: Is H1N1 actually more deadly?</p>
<p>A: There was a long-running assumption that a pandemic strain of influenza would be more deadly than seasonal flu. So far, H1N1 is not proving more deadly. If anything, it will probably be less lethal than a seasonal flu. But remember, a run-of-the-mill seasonal flu kills an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 Canadians each year.</p>
<p>Q: Is the risk of contracting the flu and dying the same for everyone?</p>
<p>A: Anyone can contract the flu – seasonal or H1N1 – unless they have some immunity, either from prior exposure or vaccination. But, generally speaking, the healthier a person is, the better they can fight off infections. Seasonal flu usually kills the frail elderly and others with chronic health conditions. H1N1 is unusual in that it is killing younger people (under 50), some of them quite healthy prior to contracting the flu. Two-thirds of those dying of H1N1 are women, a fact that researchers can’t really explain. People born prior to 1957 (when a similar flu strain circulated) seem to have partial immunity so a lot fewer seniors are getting sick than with the seasonal flu. However, when older people do contract H1N1, the death rate is quite high.</p>
<p>Q: Are smokers more at risk of swine flu?</p>
<p>A: Smokers are not at greater risk of contracting H1N1. But studies show that if smokers – and their children - are infected with influenza, they are at greater risk of complications. There is no reason to believe it is any different with H1N1. This is not surprising as influenza is a respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Q: I keep reading that there is an “epidemic” and a “pandemic,” which implies there is an imminent threat. But I just don't see an epidemic or pandemic out there, just a lot of fear-mongering.</p>
<p>A: Epidemic and pandemic are technical terms that refer to the geographical spread of a disease, not its severity. H1N1 is a pandemic because it has spread to virtually every country in the world since it first surfaced in humans in March. To date, swine flu has been classified as mild.</p>
<p>Q: There is flu every year. Is this year any different?</p>
<p>A: The flu always travels from West to East across the country. It usually starts in November, peaks in January, and peters out by March. With H1N1, the flu season has started much earlier this year. Does that mean it will be done earlier? That's possible. But a more likely scenario is that there will be a second wave of influenza after Christmas, probably with a seasonal strain.</p>
<p>Q: I've had the flu before. What's the big deal?</p>
<p>A: The “flu” has become a catch-all term but it is not a cold, or a gastrointestinal bug. Influenza (H1N1 or otherwise) is unpleasant and will put you out of commission for about a week: You suffer fever, coughing, chills, muscle aches, and extreme fatigue; many people have trouble getting out of bed. The vast majority of those infected will get better with rest and plenty of fluids but, in some cases, the symptoms can be so severe that they can result in hospitalization and death.</p>
<p>Q: How do I know if my flu is the serious kind?</p>
<p>A: The flu is a respiratory illness. A person who has trouble breathing should seek immediate medical attention, as should someone with persistently high fever (particularly children). H1N1 can be treated with antivirals if treatment begins early enough. One of the distinguishing factors of those who have died of H1N1 far is that they waited too long to seek treatment.</p>
<p>Q: How is the flu treated?</p>
<p>A: Generally, bed rest will do it, but when symptoms are more serious there are two prescription drugs available, the antivirals oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza).</p>
<p>Q: Can I take antivirals to prevent getting the flu?</p>
<p>A: Some countries, like the U.K., has used antivirals extensively as a prevention measure. In Canada, the approach is different: They are used almost exclusively for treatment.</p>
<p>Q: Can the flu really kill you – I mean, it’s just the flu?</p>
<p>A: The little H1N1 viruses in your body are not carrying knives to stab you in the heart. But the virus can, in some cases (about one in 1000), get deep into the lungs, causing pneumonia. The lungs fill with liquid and a person essentially drowns. Patients with severe infection are put on respirators and sometimes even heart-lung machines but about one in five die. People with the flu are also susceptible to other bacterial infections.</p>
<p>Q: If you go to a hospital with H1N1 symptoms and are tested for H1N1, how long does it take to get results to determine if you do indeed have H1N1?</p>
<p>A: Current policy is to test only people who are so sick that they require hospitalization. The H1N1 test is quick and easy but testing everyone would be a tremendous waste of money and limited lab resources. If you have the flu, it is almost certainly H1N1; sentinel testing showed that last week 99 per cent of influenza cases were H1N1.</p>
<p>Q: How long can an infected person spread this virus to others?</p>
<p>A: Generally speaking, people infected with the flu shed virus and they can infect others from one day before getting sick, to up to seven days after. New research has shown people with H1N1 can be infectious up to 13 days after contracting the illness themselves.</p>
<p>Q: If people can infect others before they get sick and after they get better shouldn’t we all stay home?</p>
<p>A: It is true that people can infect others when they have no visible or audible symptoms. But the reality is that they are far more likely to spread the virus when they are sick because of the coughing, runny nose and so on.</p>
<p>Q: Is it possible that the H1N1 virus will mutate and the vaccine will be useless?</p>
<p>A: It is possible but highly unlikely. To date, the H1N1 virus has been remarkably stable and the vaccine more effective than expected (for example requiring only one shot, not two). But when flu season comes around next year, you will need a new shot because the circulating strains will be different.</p>
<p>Q: When will this all be over?</p>
<p>A: With H1N1, the flu season started early, so it will probably end early – the flu will likely have spread all over the country by Christmas. What happens after Christmas remains unclear, but likely the strains of seasonal flu will start to spread more aggressively.</p>
<p>Q: Who can I call if I have more questions?</p>
<p>A: The Public Health Agency of Canada has a H1N1 hotline 1-800454-8302. Most provinces and health regions also have telehealth lines that you can call for information, including where to get a flu shot.</p>

<p>SUPPORTIVE PARENTS BEST FOR YOUNG DRIVERS</p>
<p>When it comes to monitoring teenagers behind the wheel, a strict but supportive parenting style seems to be the most effective at nurturing safe young drivers.</p>
<p>In a report published in the October issue of Pediatrics, researchers found that kids with authoritative parents were generally safer drivers.</p>
<p>Compared to teens with uninvolved parents, they reported half the crash risk, were 71 per cent less likely to drive when intoxicated, used seat belts nearly twice as often, and were less likely to speed or talk on a cellphone while driving.</p>
<p>Authoritarian parenting, which the report defined as being strict but with less emotional support than authoritative parenting, encouraged teens to follow rules reinforced by laws, such as seatbelt use and speeding.</p>
<p>But in some cases, teens construed authoritarian parents as being too controlling. Parental monitoring of safe driving behaviour was more effective when coupled with warm, active support, the report found. Indifferent or inattentive parenting was least effective at encouraging safe habits.</p>
<p>ASTHMA HEIGHTENS RISK FOR SEVERE H1N1 FLU</p>
<p>An analysis in 10 U.S. states of people hospitalized with the pandemic strain of H1N1 influenza shows that asthma is by far the most common underlying condition associated with severe cases of the disease.</p>
<p>In children, other much rarer chronic conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, cerebral palsy and muscular dystrophy, are also predisposing patients to life-threatening bouts of the virus, federal health officials said.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention studied the experience of about 1,400 people older than 18, and 500 children, who had been hospitalized in 10 states since the new influenza strain emerged in April.</p>
<p>Among the hospitalized adults, 26 per cent had asthma, 10 per cent had diabetes, and 8 per cent had a chronic lung disease such as emphysema.</p>
<p>Another 7.6 per cent were immunosuppressed from cancer, HIV infection or other ailment and 6.1 per cent were pregnant.</p>
<p>(Heart disease was also common, although CDC officials couldn't immediately say what fraction of patients had it.)</p>
<p>CDC epidemiologists don't yet know what fraction of the rest were obese -- a newly recognized risk factor for severe or fatal flu.</p>
<p>An earlier analysis of 227 patients found that 15 per cent were obese, and 8 per cent were morbidly obese.</p>
<p>Among children hospitalized with flu, asthma and neurological or muscular diseases were the most common underlying conditions, followed by blood disorders, especially sickle cell.</p>
<p>About 6 per cent of children had a blood disorder; percentages for the other conditions weren't available.</p>
<p>Dr. Anne Schuchat, a physician who directs the CDC's centre for immunization and respiratory diseases, said there are two reasons pregnant women are at unusually high risk for flu complications.</p>
<p>Pregnancy is a state of controlled immunosuppression that keeps the mother from rejecting the fetus as "non-self" but may also reduce her capacity to resist infection.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>CBC TV News reports that the federal government is expected to approve the pandemic vaccine this week and has already shipped millions of doses to provinces and territories.</p>
<p>The CBC says they shipped the vaccine in advance so local health authorities would have immediate access to it once it was approved.</p>
<p>If the vaccine is approved, officials hope they will be ready to dispense the vaccine within a couple of days. The early batches will be earmarked for pregnant women and very young children.</p>
<p>Publicly the plan was to give authorities until early November to organize the vaccination program, but privately the government has been co-ordinating an earlier rollout for weeks, the CBC said last night.</p>
<p>So far British Columbia has been the hardest hit by the second wave of the swine flu. Health officials are concerned that similar outbreaks will happen in other parts of the country before a vaccine is available.</p>

<p>11The numbers tell the story. The Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service responds to 78,000 medical calls a year and transports about 60,000 people to a hospital emergency room. Of those, only 10 per cent, or about 6,000, are critically ill with potentially life-threatening injuries. It's obvious, then, that many people can be treated in their homes in a much more affordable and efficient manner than is now the case.</p>
<p>The paramedic service wants to acquire one Ford Focus for a pilot project in northwest Winnipeg and, if it proves its value, expand to a fleet of four sedans. A local auto dealer has already offered to donate the first vehicle, which would be staffed by a single paramedic.</p>
<p>The timing of the proposal, which requires provincial approval, is linked to the anticipated increase in medical calls as a result of both the seasonal and H1N1 flu. The service estimates it will receive about 15,000 influenza-related calls this season alone, but if there is a larger outbreak, it wants permission to increase the number of cars immediately.</p>
<p>The paramedic-in-a-Focus will act much like a triage nurse in determining the level of emergency. If a trip to the hospital is indicated, a full ambulance can be summoned, or the paramedic could even drive the patient to the hospital.</p>
<p>The service eventually wants the ability to connect electronically with emergency rooms to increase communication with doctors and experts. In some cases, all a client really needs is an appointment with a doctor, and not a wild ride to the hospital with sirens blaring.</p>
<p>The new service model, assuming it is fully developed, should remove pressure on emergency rooms and paramedics, while enhancing the quality of care. The city tried using a motorcycle as a fast-response vehicle for paramedics about seven years ago, but discovered it was too dangerous.</p>
<p>The newer scheme, however, does not involve flashing lights, sirens or speeding. That alone makes it more appealing for clients who don't want the neighbourhood to know about their problems.</p>
<p>The province should ensure that paramedics have all the training they need for the new response system and then promptly approve it.</p>

<p>No kid likes having a needle. Many will be upset to hear that they will need not only their seasonal flu shot, but an additional one for H1N1.</p>
<p>Do not lie to your child about getting an injection, pediatrician Lonnie Zeltzerat of UCLA's <span class="companylink">Mattel</span> Children's Hospital says.</p>
<p>No one likes having a needle, but if you reassure your child that there are ways to make the hurt go away, you can help them have a less painful experience.</p>
<p>There are several ways parents can ease the ordeal.</p>
<p>The key, she says, is to be creative and use the right combination of tactics depending on your child's age and fear level.</p>
<p>Tips to minimize the pain:</p>
<p>- With young children, bring soap bubbles and blow bubbles during the injection, suggesting they are "blowing away the hurt."</p>
<p>- With a crying infant, if the parent places the plastic bubble-maker in front of the child's mouth, as they cry out, they will make bubbles.</p>
<p>Zeltzer has seen babies stop in mid-cry because they were distracted by the bubbles.</p>
<p>- Bubbles might not work with older children, but parents can help the child to breathe out slowly as if he/she were blowing up a big balloon.</p>
<p>- Ahead of time ask your doctor about a numbing cream or for the specific areas to be injected.</p>
<p>- If your doctor approves, give your child a pain reliever, such as Tylenol, about one hour ahead.</p>
<p>On returning home, put an ice bag on the injection site to reduce local swelling and pain.</p>

<p>Re: "Symptoms don't keep Quebecers at home" (Gazette, Oct. 16).</p>
<p>A poll conducted by a provincial human resources group suggests that one of four people living in Quebec plans to go to work even if they or someone in their home get the swine flu.</p>
<p>Why is it not a crime to deliberately make other people sick? If you intentionally run someone down with your car, you are subject to be charged with a crime. If you know you are sick and you go to the workplace anyway, is it not a crime against those who must come into contact with you there?</p>
<p>This is especially true in restaurants and other food businesses where a sick server, for example, might make dozens of people sick in a few hours and those people go out and about carrying viruses to their families and friends. It is a crime!</p>

<p>Premier Ed Stelmach, in his$1,000 suit, offers to take a cut in the huge raise he gave himself, hoping nurses tear up contracts promising them a raise next year. He should remember how the nurses scared the Saskatchewan government in to cancelling an election a few years ago.</p>
<p>The United Nurses of Alberta seem most upset at putting LPNs in RNs' jobs--a move that saves money, but also endangers patients who need the more-skilled nurses. Imagine if we were offered doctors who only completed half of their medical school education.</p>

<p>Is H1N1 the new Y2K?</p>
<p>The American Hockey League's Manitoba Moose are taking no chances on front lines of flu fighting, employing every precaution and element of common sense they can muster to protect the health of the team.</p>
<p>The team's enforcer--off the ice, that is--is head athletic therapist Rob Milette, who was already a trained bug vigilante.</p>
<p>He said the team's medical bay is always on alert for health threats like colds and flu, and that this hockey season will be no different.</p>
<p>But Milette said that given the H1N1's apparent ease of transmission, extra attention will be paid to symptoms.</p>
<p>"The (H1N1) flu itself is no more dangerous than the common flu," Milette said this week. "It's just that much more susceptible to transmission. It's easier to catch, and that's why it has spread so quickly. The effects on two people, one with each kind of flu, are basically the same, but it can be transferred that much more quickly.</p>
<p>"Our guys have been instructed to constantly wash their hands with anti-bacterial soap. We have hand sanitizers around the room. Sharing sweat towels, we'll try to keep that to a minimum, so every period of a game we're changing to fresh towels. And on the bench with water bottles, same thing.</p>
<p>"If anybody has any symptoms, they're getting quarantined from the team, basically. Especially if we're on the road, they'll get their own room."</p>

<p>MANITOBA has had three confirmed cases of H1N1 since Sept. 1 -- but there has been no public health reason compelling enough to make public where they occurred, say Manitoba Health officials.</p>
<p>There were three cases between Sept. 1 and Oct. 12, the latest date for which reports are available.</p>
<p>One case was reported in each of the weeks of Sept. 8, Sept. 15 and Sept. 22.</p>
<p>Health officials have not provided details or commented on the unusually high levels of absenteeism reported Friday at three rural schools: Ashern Early Years School in Lakeshore School Division, and in Turtle River S.D.'s Alonsa Collegiate and Grass River School in Glenella.</p>
<p>Education Minister Peter Bjornson directed school divisions this week to post daily updates on their websites of school-by-school absentee rates, either usual or higher than usual.</p>
<p>The two divisions' superintendents have not been available to comment.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health says there must be a compelling public health reason to identify any community or institution where illness occurs.</p>
<p>"Reporting unusual levels of absenteeism doesn't change the way that we report on lab-confirmed cases of H1N1," a provincial heath official said.</p>
<p>"They're posted on our website weekly (no new cases in the week ending Oct. 12), but we do not identify communities (including schools, facilities, etc.) unless there is a public health reason to do so."</p>
<p>About 80 per cent of the province's school divisions are providing daily reports of absenteeism on their websites, and the rest are expected to begin posting by early this week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No one to come to your rescue - All too often, paramedics are stuck in ER</b>
</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch    </div>
<div>1069 words</div><div>19 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>For about an hour every day in the summer, Winnipeg had no ambulances available to send to emergencies. Not one. Not even an ambulance temporarily off-duty for a lunch break.</p>
<p>That's the evidence from new data compiled by the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service, which is battling the regional health authority to end the bottleneck of paramedics in emergency rooms.</p>
<p>In June, the city was without an available ambulance for a total of 32 hours. In July, the shortage was more acute -- a total of 37 hours with no ambulances. In August, things got a little better. All told, there were no ambulances for nearly 27 hours that month.</p>
<p>Ken Sim, the fire paramedic service's deputy chief of operations, cautions that the shortages don't last for more than 10 or 15 minutes at any one time. Senior staff at WFPS get on the phone with hospital officials and pressure them to free up ambulances from ERs.</p>
<p>But Sim and front-line paramedics say the city runs out of ambulances so regularly that the service is constantly hovering just above crisis level. That crisis will only get worse if Winnipeg gets whacked with an H1N1 flu outbreak this winter.</p>
<p>"What if, at the moment we have no ambulances, a child is choking. What if that's my family?" said Chris Broughton, the president of the paramedics union. "If we continue to operate like this and have 30 hours a month with no ambulances, at some point people are going to start dying needlessly."</p>
<p>Not only is the city short at least four ambulances to handle a sizable increase in call volumes, but those ambulances are getting jammed up at city emergency rooms, waiting to off-load patients to harried doctors and nurses. Paramedics and city officials argue that hallway medicine has effectively been downloaded into ambulances.</p>
<p>About a decade ago, it only took Winnipeg's medics about 28 minutes on average to hand over a patient to ER staff. Now, it takes 49 minutes. And, it's just shy of an hour at the city's busiest emergency room, Health Sciences Centre.</p>
<p>"We're waiting in hospitals so much that we've effectively lost four ambulances," Sim said. "Our off-load times are double what they should be."</p>
<p>In February, two medics spent eight hours at St. Boniface General Hospital's ER waiting to hand over a woman with a minor leg injury.</p>
<p>Four-hour waits are not uncommon, but by then medics are already "ER shopping" -- deliberately bypassing a busy ER in favour of one farther away, which irritates patients and their families.</p>
<p>Off-load times have been a thorn in the side of Winnipeg paramedics for years, and last fall the city started needling the WRHA to make changes. Traditionally, the relationship between the city and the WRHA has been pretty good, but rising off-load times are straining that relationship.</p>
<p>Helen Clark, the WRHA's patient transport and EMS liaison, said it's no secret that ERs get overloaded. But she said several things have been done to free up medics faster, such as hiring more respiratory technicians to care for incoming patients, and allowing medics to "pair up" patients. Two medics can head back out on the road while two others who are already in the ER keep an eye on both patients.</p>
<p>But Sim and Broughton said there are some common-sense fixes that could dramatically speed up off-load times. Sim wonders why people arriving for scheduled surgeries are admitted at the ER instead of at a ward.</p>
<p>Also, why can't medics transporting a patient with a hip fracture bypass the ER registration desk, triage nurse and the ER doctor by heading to the X-ray department? Why can't a heart attack patient go right to a cardiologist or to the "cath lab" for tests? Broughton wondered</p>
<p>"We'd get the problem solved right now, not half an hour or an hour from now," Broughton said.</p>
<p>"That person has a better outcome, lives longer, has fewer negative side-effects, spends less time in the hospital, requires less medication. It equates to millions of dollars in savings."</p>
<p>Clark said the WRHA is looking at some of those ideas. But she said a lot can change when you transfer a patient, and it might not make sense to bypass the ER. "At the end of the day, we want to do what's most appropriate for patients and to ensure the safety of those patients."</p>
<p>maryagnes.welch@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>What happens in Vegas...</p>
<p>Several years ago, Nevada passed legislation mandating that emergency rooms free up paramedics in 30 minutes or less from the time the medics arrived with a patient.</p>
<p>There's no punishment or fine for hospitals that fail, but observers say the legislation has changed the way emergency rooms operate and waiting times for medics are dropping.</p>
<p>Calls increase</p>
<p>in Winnipeg</p>
<p>2004: 61,982 medical calls or 3,799 calls per ambulance</p>
<p>2008: 71,039 medical calls or 4,365 calls per ambulance</p>
<p>Industry guidelines say that each ambulance should handle only about 3,500 calls a year, meaning WFPS was taxed even in 2004.</p>
<p>Efforts to shrink</p>
<p>number of calls</p>
<p>Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service is rethinking how it responds to low-risk 911 calls.</p>
<p>A two-year-old project in which the Downtown Biz transports people to the Main Street Project's drunk tank instead of tying up paramedics. That has reduced patient transports by about 2,500 a year. A paramedic works out of the Main Street project to assess and treat any intoxicated people.</p>
<p>Firefighters who are trained medics but who ride in fire trucks have taken about 10,000 calls off the yearly tally. It's estimated that the dual firefighter-paramedic program will only ever be able to handle about 15,000 calls a year because those are the ones that don't require transport to the hospital.</p>
<p>WFPS and the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority are hoping for the province's approval to start sending medics to calls in a Ford Focus. The medic would respond to non-life-threatening calls and act more like a nurse who makes house calls. That could also shrink the number of trips to ERs.</p>

<p>Remnants of red and green marker shadow the whiteboard in the boardroom next to Abba Gumel's office.</p>
<p>They are leftovers from the formulas and equations he scribbled during a recent H1N1 brainstorming session. "You should have seen it," says the University of Manitoba mathematics professor, noting that the board was covered with equations and the room was filled with provincial public health officials looking for help from Gumel and his colleagues.</p>
<p>The experts were trying to come up with a mathematical model that would help them deal with the next wave of H1N1 expected to hit the province.</p>
<p>Gumel was a little boy in Nigeria when he first fell hard for the numbers and geometric shapes his uncle drew on a classroom chalkboard.</p>
<p>The then-three year old--who loved to go to work with his uncle, a school principal and teacher--was mesmerized by what he saw. "I still can capture that," recalls Gumel, who admits that it's unusual for most people to have such warm, fond memories of mathematics. "He would take me to school on his shoulders and put me in the back of his classroom and do his arithmetic."</p>
<p>Fast-forward four decades; numbers, equations and figures still bring an unusual joy to Gumel, 43, who was born is Nigeria and educated there as well as in England.</p>
<p>His joy stems from how he turns math into medicine, of sorts.</p>
<p>Like a physician uses drugs to help the sick, Gumel uses math -- the sort of numbers he first became acquainted with in his uncle's classroom -- to help public health officials map out how infectious diseases such as HIV and H1N1 will strike populations.</p>
<p>He also uses his equations to determine how governments can eradicate such deadly infections. He's currently working with Nigeria on a mathematical model he says will eventually wipe out HIV in that resource-limited West African country. Earlier this year, he won the Dr. L.E. Nicolle Award for a scientific article that panned Canada's Avian Flu preparedness. That article appeared in the March 2008 issue of the Canadian Journal of Infectious Diseases and Medical Microbiology.</p>
<p>In the next week or two Gumel and provincial health officials will more than likely come up with a mathematical strategy for controlling H1N1 in Manitoba, he says.</p>
<p>While most of the public is not aware that math is actually used to help curb the spread of disease, Gumel says the concept makes good sense.</p>
<p>He and his math colleagues use the figures provided by doctors and statisticians -- such as the number of people susceptible to an infection, the number of people infected and the number of people hospitalized -- to build an equation.</p>
<p>What he comes up with are numerical projections to help officials prepare for an outbreak and curb it.</p>
<p>"The concern that (officials) have right now is ICU demand," says Gumel, noting that ICU ventilators are expensive and current resources are limited. "(I can tell them) how many people will be infected, how many people will need hospitalization, how many people will die. That kind of thing."</p>
<p>Gumel says his work is more than just about numbers; it's inherently connected to real-life people.</p>
<p>The father of three, who grew up in a middle-class family, has seen the effects of disease. Most recently, it was during a tour of an African hospital where he stood near an AIDS patient on the verge of death.</p>
<p>"I've never seen a human being like that in my life -- basically no flesh, just bones," says Gumel, his usually quick speech slowing. "Up until now, I see that image of that person in my head.</p>
<p>"It's real. It's not just me sitting down in this office and just trying to do something. I can see the connection. I can see... the potential impact my kind of work could have on the lives of millions of people. This is amazing." It's this absolute passion for math that makes Gumel different from others in field, says Prof. Guenter Krause, the University of Manitoba's head of mathematics.</p>
<p>"A lot of mathematicians have this reputation -- and often it's justified -- for sitting in their office, in their ivory tower and only working on problems that nobody else other than mathematicians can understand," says Krause. "He does something positive to make this world a better world.</p>
<p>"I would call him a humanitarian. He applies his knowledge to improve the human condition."</p>
<p>Gumel admits that mathematical models aren't always accurate in predicting the effects of disease. But most are, he says -- particularly the SARS model he helped develop during the 2003 outbreak. The model advised health officials that they did not need a SARS vaccine, just quarantine measures. "We said that right from the beginning," says Gumel, who has lived in Winnipeg since 1999 .</p>
<p>Mathematical models aren't about absolute numbers, he says. Rather, they are qualitative, identifying definitive trends.</p>
<p>"Math is a beautiful language. That's the way I define mathematics -- it's a language to me. It's a language of precision. It's at the foundation of all the sciences. Either X equals Y or X is not equal to Y. There is no ambiguity. It's clear," he says.</p>
<p>"So to be part of that, to be able to use that to help humanity -- for me, there's just nothing greater."</p>
<p>On Wednesday Oct. 21, Prof. Abba Gumel will speak to the public about how he uses math to control disease. The seminar will take place at 7 p.m. at the U of M in room 290 of the education building. Admission is free. For more information, call 474-9020.</p>

<p>Near tragedy on bike</p>
<p>On Thanksgiving, while cycling on Henderson Highway, in an unearthly rush of speed, I was hit by a car. In what seemed like a millisecond my bicycle was torn from my grip and I was sent into the air, spinning once around and miraculously landing on my feet facing halted traffic. Headlights illuminated my demolished bicycle and strewn gear. A broken rear view mirror from a car, still in its casing with sidearm attached, lay at my feet. The offending vehicle drove on, but finally stopped a distance away, concealed around a corner in a parking lot.</p>
<p>Not until I moved my bike, picked up the rear view mirror and began walking did the driver get out. I inquired if he was alright -- only to receive any angry response as to why he had no option but to hit me, given the road construction, while fiercely complaining about the $500 replacement cost of the mirror. This Thanksgiving, despite outrageously callous drivers, I was indeed thankful I am still alive. Our streets are not safe for cycling. We need more and respected bicycle lanes for the safety of cyclists and drivers alike.</p>

<p>True talent trumped</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s art acquisition process reflects a procurement of art that is flawed, whilst flagrantly flaunting and condoning an autocratic system: one designer making the decisions (Hydro skimping on budget for art? Oct. 6). If art is to enlighten, to advance one's consciousness and to reawaken awareness, then the prevailing art-buying process is sorrowfully misguided and essentially wrong. The art acquisition process must be more democratic, more equitable, more accessible.</p>
<p>Is Ben Wasylyshen furnishing his own home with this art? No. Why is he then filling the Hydro building with his choices, his selections? That the art be conservative and by living Manitoba artists is the basis for his art-buying foray. Wasylyshen has been bestowed the privilege of eliminating those artists whom he feels do not fit the bill. One man, one sensibility, one discretionary determination. Where is the selection committee? Where is the initial call for submission to all Manitoba visual artists? Established protocol should preside over the purchase of art, most notably for a public corporation.</p>
<p>Finally, is a designer an authority on art? How essential and worthy is an art collection that is based on criteria that "this work goes well with that space"? How myopic is this view! <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> deserves better. Manitoba's visual artists deserve better.</p>
<p>The blatant disregard for the vast pool of talented professional artists left out of the art purchasing process is extremely unpalatable; an egregious example of autocracy. True talent trumped by tepid testimonials.</p>

<p>Distracted, dangerous</p>
<p>How's this for ironic? One Saturday afternoon, my husband and I were walking our dogs at the intersection of Academy and Wellington. As we started to cross the street, we realized that a Duffy's taxi driver wasn't going to stop in time and he just barely avoided plowing into us. He'd been far too involved in his cellphone conversation to even realize we were there. We did manage to jump out of his way in time but what really made us shake our heads was the fact that he was driving a cab painted with the MLCC's new campaign, "I Hate Impaired Drivers." Just what part of the word impaired does he not get?</p>

<p>Help for homeowners</p>
<p>Re: Conservation Minister Stan Struthers' letter regarding sewage ejectors (Risk of ejecting sewage, Oct. 9). The ejectors now in operation where regulated, approved and inspected by the provincial government. Instead of working with families that had these approved systems installed as an improvement over septic fields, they arbitrarily ban these systems and let these families absorb the cost of replacement.</p>
<p>Using this logic, we ask why Manitoba's large hog barns be allowed to operate. For example, a barn of approximately 900 animal units would produce the equivalent amount of untreated sewage from 300 family homes. Hog sewage is purported to have seven times the potency of human sewage. When hog sewage in injected in fields it is by no means completely buried. What prevents pets and wildlife from traversing these fields? What about the health concerns of wildlife, pets and humans that may pass through the thousands of acres of land where hog sewage has been injected?</p>
<p>We are aware of a conservation officer who refused to traverse a field where hog manure had been recently injected due to "bio health concerns." With hog barn operators receiving government assistance, is it unreasonable for the government to pay for the cost of homeowners to install septic fields?</p>

<p>H1N1 and travel</p>
<p>Last month, Mexico's health secretary Jose Angel Cordova said his country could see up to five million new cases of swine flu (H1N1) this winter. Deaths could reach 2,000.</p>
<p>Travel agents who depend on these tour operator companies for direction are receiving none in regard to health concerns down south. Even the companies' own websites show business as usual. Not a word on Mexico's pandemic.</p>
<p>How callous. Anyone who has ever travelled knows how a dream holiday can quickly become a nightmare. But trying to get any acknowledgment much less a dime of compensation is a waste of time.</p>

<p>Dentist's misconduct</p>
<p>Re: Prominent dentist stripped of licence (Oct. 7). I felt it would be appropriate to offer some clarification. The sentence "Woensel said the investigation found Boyar did not perform any dentistry while these people were under anaesthesia and simply sent them on their way" was an innocent misinterpretation of the conversation I had with the reporter.</p>
<p>The majority of instances of professional misconduct by Dr. Ronald Boyar relate to billing for procedures that were not performed on patients who required care in a hospital setting for physical or mental reasons. Boyar would perform some procedures on these patients but bill for additional procedures. It was only through the diligence of Health Science Centre staff that concerns were raised and led to the investigation and discovery of the misconduct. Their efforts and care are to be commended.</p>

<p>Fee hikes inadequate</p>
<p>While it is true that universities and colleges found "creative" ways around the decade-long tuition fee freeze in Manitoba, we have been misled into thinking that allowing tuition fees to rise is a better policy. Neither a half-hearted freeze nor fee increases are what's required to fund our institutions and improve access and retention. A continued investment in institutions, faculty and staff, and students is needed to improve education.</p>
<p>Next door in Ontario, a formerly outspoken advocate of fee increases has come to understand this basic issue. Former University of Toronto president Robert Prichard clearly admits his mistake in pushing for fee increases:</p>
<p>"Our principal response (to budget cuts in the 1990s), in the short term, was higher tuition. Unfortunately, the new funds from undergrads did not improve quality for them; the money just mitigated the damage. Students were right to feel abused."</p>
<p>The current budgetary woes of the University of Manitoba are a case in point. Tuition fees and enrolment are on the rise, yet university management is crying poor as loud as ever, and preparing what sounds like an assault on staff and faculty. Part of the explanation surely lies in poor management at the province's only comprehensive university, but equally to blame is the lack of a coherent government commitment to post-secondary education in Manitoba.</p>
<p>Whomever becomes premier in the coming days will need to understand these issues, and commit to investing in lower user fees and more public funding for universities and colleges.</p>

<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Saskatoon is suspending the common cup portion of communion next Sunday to avoid the possible spread of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>About 100 parishes in the diocese will stop offering wine in the common cup until the threat of H1N1 is over, said diocese administrator Rev. Ron Beechinor. The full eucharist will still be offered under the new guidelines, he added.</p>
<p>"We'll still have communion at mass, but in the form of bread," Beechinor said Sunday. "We want to make sure we're doing this as a faith-based community until the H1N1 scare is over."</p>
<p>The diocese -- which includes parishes in Saskatoon and surrounding rural areas such as Humboldt and Kindersley -- is following recommendations from the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>"It makes a good deal of sense," said Beechinor. "When H1N1 is no longer a threat, we'll go back to the common cup."</p>

</p>
<p>'Cough," said my doctor, so I did, and he threw me out of his office.</p>
<p>"Why," I asked.</p>
<p>"You coughed," he said. "Might be swine flu."</p>
<p>OK, that story isn't true. Still, you can't be too careful these days, as I explained to my wife while she clawed at the door to the house, trying to get back inside.</p>
<p>"Let me in," she shouted through the mail slot. "I had a cracker stuck in my throat."</p>
<p>A likely story. I know the infectious hack of H1N1 when I hear it. No way I was letting her drag me into her pestilential swamp.</p>
<p>But then, for once, I pulled down my surgical mask and paused: Could it be that I was overreacting?</p>
<p>Frequent readers might recall that I am one of the world's great Chicken Littles, every health scare, every potential crisis sending me scurrying for the bunker. Norwalk, ebola, killer bees, radon gas -- I panic like a Maple Leafs fan, every time.</p>
<p>The apocalyptic promise of Y2K was a major disappointment: I ended up with a six-year supply of Spam and a $40,000 Visa bill when the millennium meltdown fizzled in 2000.</p>
<p>I freaked out and screamed "Anthrax!" every time I got doughnut dust on my shirt in 2001, which was also the year of the global foot-and-mouth disease outbreak, the one where I had to shoot my farmer friends, just in case. That meant there weren't too many of them to worry about during the mad cow cull of 2003 and the Great Chicken Genocide of 2005, when an avian flu outbreak emptied supermarket shelves.</p>
<p>Interspersed were the frightening discovery of Cryptococcus neoformans on Vancouver Island in 2002, which led me to hold my breath every time we drove past Parksville, and the arrival of SARS in 2003, after which I swore off Toronto forever. (OK, that's also a fib: I swore off Toronto in 1978.)</p>
<p>SARS was the one that shook our confidence in pandemics. It was supposed to sweep the globe like Tamagotchis, or the Atkins diet, or the Spice Girls. Luckily, only 800 people died during the outbreak, including 44 in Canada. More Canadians are hit by lightning in an average year than were killed by SARS.</p>
<p>Which brings us to H1N1. It is already much more widespread in Canada than was SARS. As of Friday, about 4,800 people had succumbed to the disease worldwide, including 80 in Canada. But the thing is, the overall mortality rate from H1N1 isn't much greater than for the seasonal flu that leaves you singing to the porcelain now and then -- although H1N1 has a different profile, hitting younger people harder. The B.C. Centre for Disease Control says 4,000 to 8,000 Canadians die of seasonal flu and/or pneumonia every year.</p>
<p>But look at the difference in response: A coughing passenger was asked to leave a Victoria bus the other day. Ottawa churchgoers have been asked to stop holding hands during the Lord's Prayer. In India, so many people took to wearing surgical masks in public in August that the price shot from 10 cents to $3 -- this at a time when H1N1 had killed a total of 21 people in a nation of 1.2 billion.</p>
<p>Christopher Hitchens reports Cairo's garbage problem is out of control now that the pigs that used to devour the city's organic waste have been slaughtered in the belief that they were carriers of "swine flu." Likewise, Afghanistan's only pig was quarantined at the Kabul zoo out of fear that it could spread the disease to humans. (If you're the only pig, where do you get the flu from?)</p>
<p>H1N1 could, in fact, prove worthy of the hysteria. I am, if necessary, fully prepared to panic. But as a layman, gosh, it's hard to figure out when.</p>
<p>Well, panic is never good, says Ray Wadia of the Centre for Disease Control. But neither is complacency. Note the "definitely sobering" news that many of those who were hospitalized or died of H1N1 had no underlying conditions.</p>
<p>Best to be prepared, Wadia says. Plan for contingencies: Is there someone to care of you or your kids if you're ill? Talk to your doctor if you're in a high-risk group.</p>
<p>Mostly, just practise common sense and good hygiene: Wash your hands. Stay home when sick. Sneeze into your elbow. Keep your fingers out of your nose, or the noses of others. And let your family back inside.</p>

</p>
<p>Twitter has roughly six million users, and probably upward of 99 per cent of their tweets attract absolutely zero attention. But the rules are a little different for the people who make TV shows, as Hart Hanson, creator and executive producer of Fox's forensic comedy-drama Bones, learned earlier this month.</p>
<p>Hanson, an active Twitterer known for his gently ironic onset updates and affectionate exchanges with the show's hard-core fans, informed readers that his show had shut down production. "Damn swine flu!" he added.</p>
<p>Later, he admitted that he did not really know if anyone on his set had the H1N1 virus, although star David Boreanaz was out sick. But by then the tale was in full gallop of how Bones was felled by the dreaded swine flu. "Glibness and irony, probably not the best idea for Twittering," a chastened Hanson said in a later interview.</p>
<p>The entire entertainment business is struggling with the best way to use Twitter, the microblogging service founded in 2006 that has been embraced by many celebrities as a way to pitch themselves and their projects. And TV is in many respects on the front lines, given that the talent has fresh episodes of shows to promote every week.</p>
<p>The acceptance of the format goes well beyond Ashton Kutcher --who, by the way, has nearly four million Twitter followers. Take, for example, Lea Michele, the young star of Fox's Glee, who tweeted about the show's mall tour this past summer. Tracy Morgan, of NBC's 30 Rock, has quickly drawn a Twitter crowd this month with baffling and often-ribald posts.</p>
<p>Then there are tweeting producers, such as Carlton Cuse of ABC's Lost and Bill Prady of CBS' The Big Bang Theory.</p>
<p>But as the Hanson case illustrates, there's a danger in giving platoons of highly opinionated actors and writers a filterless forum where even their half-formed thoughts can be seen instantly by millions. Casting news that networks would rather manage themselves has been leaked via Twitter. Ryan Seacrest was the one who broke the news that his friend, former NBC executive Ben Silverman, was exiting the network. When NBC suddenly axed its cop drama Southland recently, Sons of Anarchy writer-producer Kurt Sutter thundered that network czar Jeff Zucker was a "rudderless buffoon." One network PR person described Twitter and other forms of social media generally as "a pain."</p>
<p>Many network officials see the risk but still sing the praises of social media as marketing and PR tools, at least for now.</p>
<p>"As a PR professional, I totally believe the pros outweigh the cons," CBS media-relations chief Chris Ender said. "It creates a deeper connection with your audience. And the audience is so fragmented that you need to use multiple forms of communication."</p>
<p>When Paul McCartney was a guest on David Letterman's show over the summer, fans began tweeting as his band set up for a rooftop performance. The flurry of reports built buzz for that night's show and helped ratings, Ender said.</p>
<p>CBS gives its talent no clear rules about tweeting, he added, so he sees a major gaffe as inevitable. "You know it's going to happen," he said.</p>

<p>Halloween has come early. The Simpsons' annual tradition, Treehouse of Horror, now in its 20th incarnation, airs tonight--thanks to a little game called baseball and a not-so-little tradition called the World Series.</p>
<p>Baseball, you see, is going to take over The Simpsons' parent network for the next couple of weekends--barring rainouts, H1N1 flu outbreaks, public hysteria or the End of Days.</p>
<p>Fox's only alternative was to wait until, like, after Halloween, which is getting so old. Nothing says yesterday's leftover candy quite like celebrating Halloween days after the fact.</p>
<p>And so, tonight, Homer, Marge and the gang scare up three new spine-tingling tales of the strange, spooky and intermittently funny kind.</p>
<p>Treehouse of Horror XX's trio of supernatural tales kicks off with Dial M for Murder, or Press #, in which Bart offers Lisa a Hitch-cock-ian deal: play a prank on Mrs. Krabappel and he will take care of "a little problem" for her. Faster than you can say "strangers on a train," Lisa finds herself in an animated homage--in beautiful black-and-white!--to such Hitchcock classics as Vertigo, Psycho, North by Northwest and Spellbound.</p>
<p>Simpsons fans too young to remember Psycho may prefer Treehouse of Horror's second tale, the self-explanatory 28 Days Later, in which Krusty the Clown serves up burgers made out of cows that were fed other cows, causing the gentle folks of Springfield to turn into lurching, munching zombies.</p>
<p>The final tale, There's No Business Like Moe Business, finds Springfield's most famous tavern owner taking Sweeney Todd a little too seriously for his, and his patrons', own good with predictably moody results.</p>

<p>Fox's only alternative was to wait until, like, after Halloween, which is getting so old. Nothing says yesterday's leftover candy quite like celebrating Halloween days after the fact.</p>
<p>And so, tonight, Homer, Marge and the gang scare up three new spine-tingling tales of the strange, spooky and intermittently funny kind.</p>
<p>Treehouse of Horror XX's trio of supernatural tales kicks off with Dial M for Murder, or Press#, in which Bart offers Lisa a Hitchcockian deal: play a prank on Mrs. Krabappel and he will take care of "a little problem" for her. Faster than you can say "strangers on a train," Lisa finds herself in an animated homage--in beautiful black-and-white!--to such Hitchcock classics as Vertigo, Psycho, North by Northwest and Spellbound.</p>
<p>Simpsons fans too young to remember Psycho-- either the Hitchcock original or the lame Vince Vaughn remake--may prefer Treehouse of Horror's second tale, the self-explanatory 28 Days Later, in which Krusty the Clown serves up burgers made out of cows that were fed other cows, causing the gentle folks of Springfield to turn into lurching, munching zombies--not unlike the way I felt after forcing myself to sit through a recent Grey's Anatomy marathon.</p>
<p>The final tale, There's No Business Like Moe Business, finds the Springfield tavern owner taking Sweeney Todd a little too seriously for his, and his patrons', own good with predictably moody results.</p>
<p>Moe's singing voice could use a little work, but then Marge doesn't exactly sound like Sarah Brightman, either.</p>
<p>All that, and Frankenstein, Dracula and The Mummy parodies, too. You may laugh or you may not, but chances are, you've never seen Homer cross-eyed before. (Fox, Global--9 p. m.)</p>
<p>-Quahog takes on the oeuvre of Stephen King in a Halloweenthemed outing of Family Guy, in which dedicated non-reader Peter Griffin stumbles across King's books for the first time and imagines himself in such King classics as Misery and The Shining. Guest voices include Adam West, George Wendt, Richard Dreyfuss, the late Roy Scheider and Danny Smith. (Fox, Global--10 p. m.)</p>
<p>-Larry David has a fist fight with Rosie O'Donnell on Curb Your Enthusiasm. And loses. Badly. As David admitted to reporters this past summer, "Let me tell you something, she's a force. She is very formidable, physically." David, on the other hand, not so much.(HBO Canada--9 p. m.)</p>

<p>B. C. leads the nation in positive tests for the H1N1 virus, also called swine flu.</p>
<p>Provincial Health Officer Dr. Perry Kendall says the rate of positive tests for the potentially deadly flu in B. C. is "several times higher than in the rest of Canada."</p>
<p>In B. C., about 50 per cent of the samples for H1N1 are proving positive compared to other provinces, where only five to 10 per cent of the samples are proving positive. The B. C. Centre for Disease Control is testing about 700 samples a day, Kendall added.</p>
<p>He was joined Friday by federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq, Canadian Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones and others at the Vancouver-based centre to give an update on H1N1.</p>
<p>"Most of the country is still seeing sporadic outbreaks," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>But Kendall said B. C. is "well into" a second wave of an H1N1 pandemic that first raised alarms in April.</p>
<p>There have been 78 hospitalizations for H1N1 in B. C. and eight deaths, although seven of those deaths involved people with underlying medical conditions.</p>

</div><div>By Larry Kusch and Bruce Owen    </div>
<div>622 words</div><div>18 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba's premier-designate faces a tough economic challenge as the country climbs precariously out of a recession and a high loonie batters the province's exporters.</p>
<p>And with flu season approaching, there is also a potential H1N1 pandemic to worry about.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Free Press shortly after his victory in the NDP leadership race on Saturday, Greg Selinger admitted there could be difficult times ahead for his new administration.</p>
<p>"There will be reductions in (federal) transfer payments, and there will be challenges as we go forward," said Selinger, 58, who will be sworn in as premier Monday morning after receiving support from two-thirds of the delegates at Saturday's NDP leadership convention.</p>
<p>"But Manitoba's economy has been growing above the Canadian average for the last four years, so we bring a lot of strengths to the table as we meet those challenges."</p>
<p>Selinger said the province will stimulate the provincial economy by continuing a $4.7-billion commitment to infrastructure improvements over the next several years.</p>
<p>But his government will be cautious when dealing with demands for new program spending.</p>
<p>"I think Manitobans are pretty sensible," Selinger said. "They're not looking for us to blow our brains out financially. They're asking us to maintain and invest in key services and we will try to do that. But everybody is going to have to be moderate in the demands they make during tough times."</p>
<p>Selinger succeeds a successful premier in Gary Doer, who had the good fortune to govern mainly through good economic times. Selinger will face voters as premier on Oct. 4, 2011, according to Manitoba's new fixed-election-date rules.</p>
<p>He said Saturday that he actually feels less pressure on his shoulders now than he did when he first contemplated a run for the leadership.</p>
<p>"I think probably the weight was greater before I decided to run. Because when you're standing back from the process, you see all the issues and all the challenges," Selinger said.</p>
<p>But once he decided to take the plunge, he said he just started swimming. "So I actually feel better about it now. I'm more pumped and ready to deal with it (the responsibility of running a government) than I was before I got into the race."</p>
<p>Selinger said he will choose a cabinet in the next two weeks and call the legislature back for a throne speech before Christmas.</p>
<p>He wouldn't discuss who would take over his old job as finance minister or how many new faces might soon sit around the cabinet table.</p>
<p>Several current cabinet ministers are rumoured as unlikely to run in the next election and a few may be willing to step down from their cabinet posts to make way for new blood.</p>
<p>Asked about that Saturday, Selinger said: "Well, if they let me know about that, we can discuss that. That will be part of the conversations -- where everybody wants to be... two years from now. We'll sort all of that out together.</p>
<p>"There's good people in caucus; there's good people in cabinet. These are hard choices because there are a lot of talented people in that caucus," Selinger said.</p>
<p>Selinger, who has a PhD from the London School of Economics, was Doer's only finance minister. He nearly became mayor of Winnipeg in 1992, losing a close vote to Susan Thompson. He moved to provincial politics in 1999, winning the St. Boniface seat.</p>
<p>He and his wife, Claudette Toupin, have two sons.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Time to get down to brass tacks - Now the business of being premier begins</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen and Larry Kusch    </div>
<div>994 words</div><div>18 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>The weight changes shoulders this morning as Manitobans go to church and get ready for the Blue Bomber tilt with the B.C. Lions.</p>
<p>At a photo-op today, Gary Doer will hand the keys to his office at the legislature to the new guy, premier-designate Greg Selinger.</p>
<p>The handover symbolizes the weight of responsibilty of being premier passing from one man to the next.</p>
<p>It's something the former finance minister has been thinking about, even dreading, well before his convincing win over Steve Ashton on Saturday.</p>
<p>And he knows he'll have to hit the ground running.</p>
<p>"I know there are a lot of issues that have to be addressed," Selinger said moments after becoming premier-designate. "We will take each one of them as they come. It's not like we haven't been unfamiliar with some of them."</p>
<p>With the focus being on Doer leaving -- he becomes Canadian ambassador to the United States as of Monday -- and on the leadership race to replace him, the business of government slowed down, Selinger said the night before the vote.</p>
<p>He was already thinking about the pile of work waiting on his new desk Monday, and the lineup of government staffers who will be waiting to brief him. Before anyone can bend his ear, he'll first be sworn in as premier by Lt.-Gov. Philip Lee.</p>
<p>"Manitobans have told us they want steady-as-she-goes government," Selinger said Saturday. "They want us to carry on the program we've got. Everywhere I've gone, people have said, 'We want you to govern Manitoba in the interests of Manitobans,' and that's what we're going to do."</p>
<p>Selinger's first task will be to put together a new cabinet and then hold a legislative session before Christmas to face the opposition. And -- perhaps more important -- to show Manitobans the NDP hasn't lost any traction with Doer's departure.</p>
<p>"As you know the economy is still one of the most important issues," Selinger said. "We have the potential of a serious H1N1 crisis. We are ready. We will be dealing with those matters. We will make sure Manitoba is well-positioned to weather all the events that are coming forward."</p>
<p>At the start of the race a month ago, Selinger showed reluctance to enter the contest.</p>
<p>"It's not like I had a lot of warning this was coming," he told the Free Press Saturday.</p>
<p>"I don't know about you, but I'm not the kind of guy that just drops my tools and runs off to a new event when it comes along. I felt committed to what I was doing (as finance minister). But once you commit, you're in."</p>
<p>He was a shoo-in the moment Andrew Swan bowed out because of poor support, making it a two-man race between Selinger and Steve Ashton. Selinger gobbled up Swan's support.</p>
<p>Ashton saw the writing on the wall, even predicting on Friday that when he goes to work at the legislature on Monday it'll be as the MLA for Thompson -- and to a basement office.</p>
<p>"Right now I'm a mail slot at the legislature," he said shortly after the 2,002 delegate votes were counted Saturday. "Right now the leadership's done. I'm going to go have a few beers. Well, maybe more than few beers. And then Monday morning I'll be back at work, probably cleaning out my mail slot."</p>
<p>Ashton said his team sensed the campaign was doomed in the days leading up to the vote. The sea of orange T-shirts worn by Selinger supporters at the convention centre, waving their orange Selinger signs and thumping their white Selinger thunder sticks, only confirmed that. Selinger beat Ashton handily: 1,317 votes to 685.</p>
<p>"I think you'll find the NDP -- we do pull together very quickly after any kind of leadership (convention) and that's going to happen now," Ashton said.</p>
<p>What must change is how delegates to leadership contests are selected, Ashton said.</p>
<p>Ashton's team complained that dozens of Selinger delegates were picked using unfilled union credentials. A complaint to the party's executive was rejected because the unions had the authority to pick any delegate they wanted.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to reform the process," Ashton said. "I think if you ask Greg Selinger, he'd agree, too."</p>
<p>Selinger does, but for different reasons.</p>
<p>"We had a one-person-one-vote system until 2007 and then we went back to the delegate system," Selinger said. "I think there are a lot of inefficiencies in the model we just went through... ."</p>
<p>Selinger said his other priority is putting the leadership campaign sniping behind him. Ashton was the first person he gestured to join him on stage.</p>
<p>"People are competitive. That part of the process is done. We were shaking hands and hugging each other on stage. I'm taking it for real."</p>
<p>After rounds of media interviews, Selinger, his wife Claudette Toupin, and two sons went to a reception with supporters and then out to a quiet dinner to bask in the victory.</p>
<p>As they sat down, a news release from the Progressive Conservatives circulated on the Internet.</p>
<p>Under the heading "Is Greg Selinger someone we can trust?" Tory CEO Jonathan Scarth directed readers to a Tory website where they could contribute money to the party.</p>
<p>"Hugh McFadyen and Manitoba's Progressive Conservatives have an unprecedented opportunity to win the next election and steer our great province in the right direction," Scarth said. "I'd like to thank you for your ongoing support and ask that you continue to stand with us as we prepare to take on Greg Selinger."</p>
<p>The honeymoon is over.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Faith and pandemic planning - Gatherings don't have to be cause for fear</b>
</div><div>By Brenda Suderman   </div>
<div>819 words</div><div>18 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>For several hours last week, Capt. Les Marshall put his faith in action at a neighbourhood health clinic, greeting and directing folks who showed up for their seasonal flu shots.</p>
<p>"I'd like to think that the Salvation Army is known for being there in time of need," explains Marshall, one of 84 Salvation Army members who volunteered at the city's seasonal flu vaccination clinics. "I think it's a ministry of presence. It's putting our talk and walk into action."</p>
<p>That ministry of presence may be one of the main roles for the city's faith communities in light of an influenza pandemic, suggests Rev. Rick Sauer of St. Mark's Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>"Maybe part of our mandate is to get people to take a realistic view of things and calm down and reach out and take care of others in the community," he says.</p>
<p>Next Wednesday evening, Sauer's Corydon Avenue congregation, along with the Manitoba Interfaith Council, hosts a public forum on the H1N1 flu virus for people across the faith traditions.</p>
<p>Many religious groups in Winnipeg have already installed hand sanitizer dispensers in their buildings and implemented measures to limit physical contact during religious rituals. At the recent High Holy Days, congregants at Shaarey Zedek Synagogue were asked to refrain from shaking hands and tissue boxes were distributed in most pews, says Rabbi Lawrence Pinsker.</p>
<p>Over at the Hindu Temple on St. Anne's Road, worshippers are encouraged to use the traditional Indian greeting of putting their hands together instead Western-style handshakes, says priest Venkat Machiraju.</p>
<p>In late September, the city's two Roman Catholic archdioceses asked parishes to empty holy water fonts, install hand sanitizer dispensers, and modify how they celebrate the eucharist.</p>
<p>Although these measures are essential for making worship practices safer in the threat of a pandemic, substituting an elbow knock for handshakes during the passing of the peace ritual in Christian worship has been an adjustment for some church goers, says Rev. Sharon Wilson of Windsor Park United Church.</p>
<p>"I hope we're being reasonable. We've really tried to educate people on what we can do. We're trying not to get drawn into the pandemonium around the pandemic," says Wilson. She estimates she now washes her hands up to two dozen times a day as she visits parishioners in hospitals and nursing homes, or meets people in her office.</p>
<p>Faith groups have to balance the need for safe and antiseptic practices with their desire to build community, admits Dr. Brent Kvern, a family practitioner who will present information on preventative flu measures at the Oct. 21 public forum. He says people don't need to panic about gathering for religious services, as long as proper precautions are taken.</p>
<p>"We don't see lots of people getting sick at church functions, but it could happen," says Kvern, a member of St. Mark's Lutheran Church.</p>
<p>In addition to modifying their worship practices and cleaning routines, the biggest role of faith communities may be to remain a calm and helpful presence in the face of widespread illness, suggests Colleen Schneider, a manager in the community help program of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>In response to requests from spiritual leaders in Winnipeg, Schneider developed a list of ways faith communities can serve the community during a health crisis, including caring for vulnerable people, training volunteers in infection control and promoting flu prevention messages. She also suggests that churches, synagogues, temples and mosques can organize their members to be "flu friends" who would collect medications, supplies and food for those taken ill with the flu.</p>
<p>"Faith communities have always played a role in helping people during critical times in their lives," she says.</p>
<p>Sauer says reducing anxiety around a looming crisis could be an important role for his congregation in the face of a pandemic.</p>
<p>"God is with us and even if we get stuck with the virus it doesn't mean the end of the world or the end of faith," he says.</p>
<p>"We are still called to be aware of the needs of others and reach out."</p>

<p>Faith and the flu</p>
<p>Prevent flu by stocking your house of worship with hand-washing supplies and hand sanitizer, and by frequent cleaning of washrooms, counters, tables, doorknobs, handles, toys and telephones</p>
<p>Set up a rapid communication system within your faith community and figure out ways to provide worship through technology</p>
<p>Identify people who can step in if church leaders are taken ill</p>
<p>Expand your base of pastoral visitors in case of increased demand due to widespread illness</p>
<p>Organize your faith community to be 'flu friends' who can assist ill people by collecting medication, supplies, and buying groceries</p>

<div id="hd"><b>36 candidates for cabinet: Who'll be the chosen ones? -</b>
</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch   </div>
<div>1032 words</div><div>18 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Reward and revitalization will be the watchwords of premier-designate Greg Selinger's next cabinet, to be named in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>Selinger said he'll have a throne speech ready before Christmas and will start work on a new cabinet Monday morning. That's a process that traditionally involves meeting with all 36 NDP MLAs and juggling abilities and alliances -- a process made more awkward following a tough leadership battle.</p>
<p>There are at least two vacant posts to fill -- Selinger's old slot as finance minister and the post of aboriginal and northern affairs, which was held by the late Oscar Lathlin and is now held on an acting basis by Rupertsland MLA Eric Robinson.</p>
<p>There is also speculation that several cabinet ministers might be retiring in two years -- those could include Justice Minister Dave Chomiak and Advanced Education Minister Diane McGifford -- and will step out of cabinet to allow rookies to rise.</p>
<p>Insiders say Selinger, who is naturally cautious, will likely only make tweaks to his cabinet, much like Premier Gary Doer used to do. He may wait for the dust to settle before making wholesale changes. But others say Selinger may have made promises to current cabinet ministers and supporters, so a bigger rejig could be possible. It's also possible that Selinger might create a new portfolio or two such as an environment ministry, or juggle responsibilities, such as creating a stand-alone housing ministry.</p>
<p>Here are the players to watch.</p>
<p>Who's in</p>
<p>Steve Ashton: Selinger made it clear his rival has a place in cabinet. Ashton is a veteran of several portfolios, most recently intergovernmental affairs. He may be a lone wolf, but he's always been a sharp minister and shows his capabilities in a crisis such as last spring's flood.</p>
<p>Andrew Swan: The young lawyer was seen as the NDP establishment's choice to renew the party. After his early departure, he threw his support behind Selinger and will certainly be rewarded with a choice cabinet post, probably justice. He'd likely be justice minister at some point even if Selinger didn't owe him.</p>
<p>Rosann Wowchuk: Word is, she could be finance minister. As agriculture minister, she sat beside Selinger for years at treasury board meetings and took over all his files when he resigned to run for leader. And she holds a rural seat, which the NDP needs to keep.</p>
<p>Theresa Oswald: She's a strong health minister. No point moving her with a possible H1N1 pandemic looming, which Selinger mentioned several times as a top priority.</p>
<p>Nancy Allan: Mouthy, funny and smart as the longtime labour minister, some say she's got the mettle to take on a bigger portfolio. But she clearly loves knocking labour and business heads together. She might stay put.</p>
<p>Stan Struthers: A goofy jokester, he's managed one of the most annoying portfolios, wrangling endlessly with environmentalists, First Nations, logging companies and cottagers in the conservation portfolio. Extremely well-liked and competent, he's likely to keep a fairly high-profile job in cabinet, perhaps as education minister.</p>
<p>Christine Melnick: She's done fairly well as water minister and she is a Selinger supporter. She's likely to stay in cabinet in a medium-sized role.</p>
<p>Ron Lemieux: His neckties may be cheesy but he's among the nicest guys in cabinet and widely seen as an excellent infrastructure and transportation minister, a real consensus builder. He could stay put if the shuffle is small or move to another medium-sized portfolio.</p>
<p>Eric Robinson: He knows everyone in the north and everyone in the aboriginal community. He's been acting aboriginal and northern affairs minister and it's almost certain Selinger will make that permanent.</p>
<p>Kerri Irvin-Ross: An awkward politician, but her staff in Healthy Living loves her and she works like a dog, insiders say. She's almost certain to stay in cabinet but Selinger talked a lot about recreation and disease prevention and he may beef up Healthy Living and put a higher-profile minister there.</p>
<p>Gord Mackintosh: He's taken the brunt of the child welfare scandals for several years, but a lot of the plans to fix Manitoba Housing and child welfare are well underway. Mackintosh, a former environmental lawyer, likes to get his hands dirty in policy, so a new environment minister portfolio could suit him.</p>
<p>Peter Bjornson: He's about to become the longest-serving education minister in Manitoba history, so he might be ready for a change. But as a former teacher, he's a good fit in education. He could move to advanced education.</p>
<p>Jim Rondeau: There was scuttlebutt he might not run again, but that's been debunked. As energy minister, he's not seen as a heavy hitter in cabinet but he was a strong Selinger supporter.</p>
<p>Who's in next</p>
<p>Bill Blaikie: As a party elder and early Selinger supporter, he's almost certainly headed for cabinet. It's just not clear where he'll land. Insiders say it's likely to be something on the social justice or environmental side, perhaps advanced education or water stewardship. He won't likely get intergovernmental affairs as long as the Conservatives rule Ottawa, but that could be a good fit, too.</p>
<p>Jennifer Howard: The Fort Rouge MLA is technically one of the rookies, but she has worked in senior health policy jobs in the NDP political office. Whip smart and politically astute, she could bypass a junior ministry and head right to the front bench, perhaps in family services and housing.</p>
<p>Erin Selby: Her Southdale seat is a top Tory target and the former television news host is widely seen as headed for cabinet next time if not now. She'd likely start in a junior ministry such as culture, or science, technology, energy and mines.</p>
<p>Drew Caldwell: The former education minister and Brandon MLA has been in the wilderness for a long time and may be ready for another shot at the big time. Plus, the NDP needs to show Brandon some love.</p>

<p>On any given day in our workforce, at least three-to-10 per cent of employees are absent from work. They are ill, caring for sick children or caring for sick, elderly parents. This absence accounts for approximately 15 per cent of payroll and can cost an organization anywhere from $2,650 annually for a salaried worker to $3,600 for an hourly worker. And with flu season coming our way, it is anticipated that absences will increase significantly.</p>
<p>According to The Lancet medical journal's online edition, as of June 15, nearly 36,000 people in 76 countries had been infected with influenza A (H1N1) and 163 have died. As a result, the pandemic alert level was raised to Phase 6 from 5 -- the highest level. Now, as we return to work from summer vacations, a new HR poll suggests that almost 70 per cent of workers are very worried about viruses at work. Organizations are ensuring hand sanitizers are available throughout their physical space, posters line the walls of public restrooms and extra careful plans for the coming flu season are being made.</p>
<p>Knowing that there is a "worry rate" among workers of 70 per cent is certainly more than worrisome for management. When people begin to feel overwhelmed and overpowered by an uncontrollable fear, they experience a sense of panic. If panic begins to creep in among a good number of your workforce, it will lead to a loss of focus and a loss of concentration which will cripple overall productivity. Not only that, the high costs of absenteeism can cripple your bottom line.</p>
<p>Many organizations have already learned that when it comes to employee health, it is wise to focus on the overall, year-round wellness of employees. They have learned that helping employees fight health issues such as obesity, high stress or lack of exercise as well as helping those employees with chronic diseases such as diabetes or heart disease simply helps to keep people at work and productive. So, where does one start? The following guidelines will help you to set up a basic workplace wellness program.</p>
<p>Establish a leadership committee -- No plan, no matter how well developed, will succeed without a leadership sponsor and program champion as well as resources specifically allocated to the cause. Select a committee of employees who have an interest in the issue and can be committed to making it work.</p>
<p>Conduct an assessment -- Before you get going, you have to find out what the status of the current situation is. Start by asking employees to fill out a health interest survey that assesses the general health environment, eating and exercise habits, personal levels of stress, problem solving and the general support for a healthy workplace program.</p>
<p>Build a multi-level program -- Develop a comprehensive program that will resonate with your workforce. Focus on the individual, yet take into consideration the different cultural values and attitudes toward the various aspects of health. Make sure you also focus on your organization and how to make it as health conscious as possible through ergonomics, cafeteria choices and HR policies.</p>
<p>Set goals -- Target the most important health issues. Offer something for everyone including those who are already fit and healthy. Provide the tools for individuals to assess themselves, set goals and motivate themselves.</p>
<p>Kick off the program -- To get people to participate, you will have to communicate and motivate them to join in. Hold a kick-off event, develop a logo and name for your program and prepare a series of events over a one year timeframe.</p>
<p>Reward and motivate -- People like to be rewarded and recognized so plan for things like posting photos of employees who have achieved success. Include celebrations in your employee newsletter. Offer inexpensive, fun giveaways.</p>
<p>Evaluate and share feedback -- It is important to track your program progress against the goals you have set for yourself. This enables you to make changes to the program as necessary. It also allows you to demonstrate the return on investment for your program.</p>
<p>A good example of wellness success is the familiar Mall of America located in Bloomington, a suburb of Minneapolis, Minn. This large facility employs a workforce of over 900 people and after only one and one half years of wellness programming, they are already experiencing evidence of success. This initiative began when managers were forced to examine what to do about increasing health-care costs. They decided that increasing employee deductibles and co-pays on their health care was simply not the right answer. Instead, they chose to focus on supporting their employees to achieve a healthier lifestyle.</p>
<p>First, they determined that their program would focus on behaviour change in the areas of weight management and smoking cessation as this issue appeared to be the easiest to implement. Within one year, the program was so successful that a full-time co-ordinator was assigned and two new programs, Shape-up and Walk to Wellness Club were implemented. Next, they added a Fruity Friday and Veggie Vensday to their program.</p>
<p>Another group of 10 participants acted as a test case for a new device worn on the waist that measured calorie burning during the day for each individual. This tool helped individuals to assess their own metabolism and put them in control of managing their weight. The Mall of America's walk to wellness program has now been opened to the public and over 2,500 people walk more than one mile a day.</p>
<p>At the same time, the management team at Mall of America knows that while its return on investment is expected to top 300 per cent, additional steps must be taken to help employees be accountable for their own health. As a result, as with many organizations in today's high-cost health-care environment, mall management is assessing the potential of adding an assessment component to all new hire processes. This means that as new employees are being signed up for health-care benefits, they will be immediately assessed for health risks such as high blood pressure, body mass index, and cholesterol.</p>
<p>Another benefit to implementing an organization-wide wellness program is that it can help to take away the fear, the stress and the focus on just one issue such as the much anticipated flu virus. Over time, health and wellness will become part of the organization culture -- simply put, it will be "the way we do things around here".</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic fears touch off wave of phony flu-fighting claims</b>

<p>Cover your mouth when you sneeze, keep your hands away from your face, wash your hands and please, please, please don't fall for claims from companies looking to cash in on the pandemic flu scare.</p>
<p>Those are the simple instructions from Canada's medical community as the country braces for a surge of cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>Some companies are offering more costly solutions than hand-washing, including UV lights, air filters, antibacterial tissues and natural supplements.</p>
<p>Health Canada issued a warning in the spring, cautioning consumers to watch out for phony products that could be ineffective, or in some cases harmful to health.</p>
<p>Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital, said antibacterial tissues or items that claim to be coated with bacteria-killing agents offer very limited protection from H1N1, because the virus is often protected within mucus, stool or other bodily secretions.</p>
<p>People prefer technological solutions to behavioural solutions, regardless of what proves effective, she said, noting influenza is transmitted primarily through close contact with an infected person.</p>
<p>"So things that clean the air might in theory have some small impact. But it is going to be small because most of it is not about the air we breathe."</p>
<p>Plenty of products offer protection from H1N1.</p>
<p>The site www.h1n1warrior.com[http://www.h1n1warrior.com] uses a comic-book-style hero and apocalyptic images to sell sanitary hand wipes and face masks.</p>
<p>A company called Verilux sells a cordless sweeper and "sanitizing" wands that emit UV light.</p>
<p>And Health Canada has warned against counterfeit or so-called generic versions of antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>"Health Canada has been monitoring the Internet to uncover websites with claims related to products to prevent and or treat the H1N1 flu outbreak," and has contacted companies to have unsubstantiated claims removed, spokesperson Christelle Legault wrote in an email.</p>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration also plans to take regulatory or criminal action against people or companies selling phony H1N1 protection products.</p>
<p>Some companies, however, stand by their products.</p>
<p>Robert LeBlanc is chief executive of LeVOCC Inc., a Brighton, Ont., company selling an air filter they say destroys the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We make no claims other than we have been scientifically proven to do one thing that nothing else has ever done, which is absolutely destroy virus RNA," he said of the $800 device.</p>
<p>LeBlanc said a strain of the H1N1 virus was run through the machine for 30 minutes, after which testing detected no evidence of its RNA, or genetic building block.</p>
<p>He added that the device was tested by a highly reputable laboratory that he cannot name until results are released in December and said he believes it would be useful in multiple-family homes.</p>
<p>McGeer cautioned that even if a product could kill the virus, that would not mean it can protect against the spread of disease.</p>
