<p>The number of Hamilton schools facing flu outbreaks continues to rise.</p>
<p>Outbreaks at Hamilton Catholic schools jumped to 17 yesterday -- an increase of seven schools over the previous 24 hours.</p>
<p>Hamilton public school outbreaks remained at 64.</p>
<p>The increase on the Catholic side reveals the worst may not be over in Hamilton's flu battle.</p>
<p>Hamilton Public Health spokesperson Tara Hall said yesterday the cumulative number of outbreaks at local schools - including public, Catholic, French, and private - is 85. She said only a handful are actually laboratory confirmed as H1N1.</p>
<p>"The thing that puzzles me is that there is no pattern, it is all over the city," said Jackie Bajus, education superintendent for the Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District High School.</p>
<p>There is just one Catholic high school on the list, Cardinal Newman.</p>
<p>Bajus said about 2,000 of the board's 28,000 students have flu symptoms. The board's staff absenteeism rate hovers around 5 to 10 per cent, with educational assistants appearing to be bearing the worst of the flu brunt.</p>
<p>Bajus hopes the numbers are peaking and that the weekend will spell relief.</p>
<p>"I've never seen it so extensive," she said. "It is quite unusual."</p>
<p>Lisa Hammond, president of the Hamilton-Wentworth Elementary Teachers Union, said schools are short-staffed and her members are pulling extra duty to keep the schools running.</p>
<p>"It is really hitting elementary hard. My concern is that my members are tired. What is happening is they don't have enough supply teachers or supply teachers may not be coming in. So teachers are losing their prep time, they are doubling up classes. They are working hard to keep the schools running and I think they are beginning to feel the strain."</p>
<p>Hammond said several of her union stewards have advised her that there are not enough teachers to cover all the classes.</p>
<p>She said pregnant and "medically-fragile" teachers are also concerned about being in the schools and exposed to the flu virus. The union is urging the Hamilton-Wentworth District School Board to be flexible on teacher absences during the outbreak.</p>
<p>"The board hasn't put anything in place to protect them. They are telling them to stay home, but they haven't offered them any relocation, and they don't seem to have a plan to deal with them."</p>
<p>As well, a lot of teachers are parents, who may have to take time off to tend to their own sick children.</p>
<p>John Forbeck, superintendent of staff and community engagement, said the board is planning to be flexible with respect to staff absences during the outbreak.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamilton day cares report mostly business as usual.</p>

</p>
<p>Two flu assessment clinics in the city open their doors today to relieve family doctors and emergency departments from the mounting pressure of an H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>The medical director of these clinics yesterday emphasized the assessment facilities are intended for "people in the middle."</p>
<p>If someone is feeling the symptoms of influenza and the fever persists, they should call their family doctor first, Dr. David McCann said.</p>
<p>The flu assessment clinics are the best option for those who cannot make an appointment with their family physician or don't have one, he said.</p>
<p>"If you are sick enough ... but not (seriously) ill, then come. But if they have shortness of breath and are delirious ... then proceed to the ER," he said.</p>
<p>While the facilities can prescribe Tamiflu, they do not administer H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>Upon arrival at the West End Clinic on Main Street West, patients will be assigned a number and wait to be assessed by a triage nurse.</p>
<p>At this stage, patients needing emergency care will be transferred to the ER, McCann said.</p>
<p>Patients who are not sick enough to be sent for emergency care, yet have not been cleared to go home, are ushered into one of 10 waiting rooms in the back, where he or she is examined first by a nurse, then a doctor.</p>
<p>McCann said they hope to treat 60 to 80 patients at each clinic per day.</p>
<p>Today, the west end flu assessment clinic will be staffed with about a dozen workers, said Karen Prine, Hamilton Health Sciences director of adult specialty services. The St. Joseph's East End Ambulatory Care Centre has about the same number of staff, she added.</p>
<p>Assessments will take about eight minutes, depending on the situation.</p>
<p>McCann said yesterday he is still calling for volunteers.</p>
<p>"Family doctors are already overwhelmed. And we're taking community doctors out. We can only take so many before we end up shooting ourselves in the foot," he said. "We recognize that the health sector is stressed."</p>
<p>McCann recommended people go through the province's self-assessment tool online at health.gov.on.ca before coming in.</p>
<p>Flu assessment clinics in Hamilton are open this weekend from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. and during the week 3 to 10 p.m. at the West End Clinic, 690 Main St. W. and the St. Joseph's East End Ambulatory Care Centre, 2757 King St. E.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 vaccination rollout suspended; Flu shot supply only 20% of what was expected</b>
</div><div>Naomi Powell  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>548 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Public health units have been directed to scrap plans to open H1N1 vaccination clinics to the general public next week as the province scrambles to manage scarce supplies of the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, instructed all 36 health units to restrict clinics to high-priority groups after the province learned it would receive only 170,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine -- just 20 per cent of what was expected.</p>
<p>Beyond frustrating soaring public demand for the only protection against the pandemic flu, the move marked a rare occasion when the province imposed a single directive on the largely autonomous public health units.</p>
<p>Until yesterday those units had taken a patchwork approach to rolling out the H1N1 vaccine, with each region making crucial decisions about how and where it would be doled out.</p>
<p>"It's an extraordinary step that was required," said David Jensen, spokesperson for the Health Ministry. "Typically they do handle these things themselves."</p>
<p>At its best, that long-standing decentralized model allows public health units to tailor services to the needs of specific communities, experts say. But when a province-wide crisis hits, the diverse strategies adopted by health units can engender confusion.</p>
<p>"This was the problem with SARS," said Joe D'Cruz, a University of Toronto professor specializing in health policy. "Everyone took their own approach and for a long time, no one knew what the right approach was."</p>
<p>As vaccine becomes available, the Ministry of Health divides doses among the public health units according to the size of the population and the number of individuals in high-priority groups. Once the vaccine arrives in the community, the units decide where the vaccine is sent, who administers it and how many doses are administered each day.</p>
<p>Both Halton and Niagara region had intended to open their vaccination clinics to the general public on Monday, while Hamilton official said they'd hold off until more vaccine arrived. All three regions have set up different schedules for their clinics, with some staying open late into the evening while others close shortly after most businesses shut down for the day.</p>
<p>"In times of a crisis like this, we need to switch to a central authority," said D'Cruz. "But it often requires a crisis before that happens."</p>
<p>Dr. Vivek Goel, president of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, defended the differing approaches of the province's health units yesterday, noting that the needs of a city such as Toronto may not be the same as that of a community in Northern Ontario.</p>
<p>Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health, agreed.</p>
<p>"There is no way the infrastructure or the experience exists at the province to tell us how to do this," he said. "We at the regional level are the ones who know best how to run our clinics. Dealing with the public does require a local response."</p>
<p>Still, the province's chief medical officer of health reserves the right to impose her will when she believes it is necessary. And if a public health unit refuses to comply, "she can order them to," said Jensen.</p>

<p>Everyone on edge, frayed nerves, a sense of "the new normal" in the culture, public authorities engaged, the topic dominating media.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus? In fact, this was the buzz nine years ago, in the shadow of 9/11.</p>
<p>Then, the Big Fear was terrorists targeting and killing Canadians -- blowing up the CN Tower, putting poison gas in the subway, pouring anthrax into letters, crashing an airliner. Canadian Forces warplanes patrolled over southern Ontario for a time and there was talk of having an "armed presence" at McMaster University's nuclear reactor.</p>
<p>Our emotional buffer zone of fear narrowed back then, just as it did with the SARS outbreak in 2003 that killed 45 Canadians. But the terrorist attack came on American soil, and in the public imagination SARS seemed mostly confined to Toronto and places from which it originated in Asia, an exotic sickness that could be avoided.</p>
<p>The collective shiver over H1N1 suggests the buffer has collapsed completely: lineups mass at clinics; a woman out in B.C. is hustled off a bus because she's coughing; office workers take to all but gargling with hand sanitizer; Anglican churches forbid dipping hand-touched wafers in communal wine (yet incongruously permit all lips sharing the same chalice.)</p>
<p>There are historic moments when a common fear seems to unite most everyone, when public perception is uniformly rocked. The H1N1 scare is one of those moments. As though mobilizing for war, governments urge Canadians to get vaccinated, the 21st-century version of the air raid siren.</p>
<p>"It's a hydra-headed fear," said psychologist Frank Farley at Temple University. "We wonder, how dangerous is the virus on one hand, and also how important is it to get the vaccine? And how likely is the virus, or the shot, to impact our children's lives?"</p>
<p>H1N1 is not on pace to kill nearly as many as seasonal flu. The Public Health Agency of Canada says that "between 2,000 and 8,000 Canadians can die of influenza and its complications annually, depending on the severity of the season."</p>
<p>But H1N1 has killed enough Canadians nationally -- 95 in six months, six this week -- and raised enough uncertainty to pump up the fear volume across all demographics. Meanwhile, the slow delivery of the vaccine, which has contributed to the lineups, has only further inflamed anxiety.</p>
<p>The recent death of a seemingly robust southern Ontario teenage boy from H1N1, and the media coverage of the tragedy, brings it closer to home, creating what psychologists call the "availability heuristic" -- a phenomenon in which people predict the frequency of an event based on how easily an example can be brought to mind.</p>
<p>More important than the number of dead is who is dying, and how. The virus reportedly can kill by turning a strong immune system against itself in a healthy person. In our health-conscious, "worried well" society, where we believe clean living controls our fate, this is the ultimate real-life horror movie scenario.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Psychologists say fear is simply about perception: the more you feel susceptible to something, the more scary it is to you, even if the emotion is independent of statistical probability. People fear shark attacks, plane crashes, tornadoes, terrorist attacks, yet do not dwell much upon dying from heart disease or a car collision, even though the latter two are far more likely to kill.</p>
<p>Other elements of the equation: we fear things we can't see, things borne of nature ("natural disasters") and illness that seems easily contagious. We have been wired ever since childhood to fear infection, said psychologist Peter Bieling, manager of mood and anxiety services at St. Joseph's Healthcare.</p>
<p>"And arguably every zombie movie ever made is about a pandemic."</p>
<p>Couple the frightening elements of H1N1 with our tendency to turn statistical probability on its head, and the fear mutates. Bieling calls H1N1 a "statistical killer." That is, we focus on the deaths of three in a thousand who had the virus, "not the 997 at home resting, and getting caught up on reruns."</p>
<p>As for fear over the new vaccine, he said, "People are very capable of ignoring the millions who have no reaction at all to a vaccine," while highlighting the one who had an adverse reaction.</p>
<p>"We're not very good at doing math like this," he said. "We just get a feeling that this is dangerous."</p>
<p>In the big picture, if we were truly consistent in taking action to avoid bringing harm to ourselves, we would, for example, wear helmets while driving, because brain injuries are often what kill in a car crash. Or, added Bieling, we would wear a four-point shoulder safety strap like racecar drivers.</p>
<p>"We don't tend to view our cars as dangerous; we worship them, but they are made to go fast and deliver forces the body cannot withstand. But we don't see them as risky."</p>
<p>As far as outbreaks go, H1N1 looms in the public consciousness in a way SARS did not. H1N1 has become part of the mainstream landscape, and that includes pop culture. On a Toronto morning radio talk show this week came word a Desperate Housewives star has H1N1. (Type in "Teri Hatcher has swine flu" on Google and it nets more than eight million hits. Rest easy, her publicist reportedly says, she just has laryngitis.)</p>
<p>The science on the virus is still in a sense an open question because it is so new, and this also helps fuel anxiety.</p>
<p>That uncertainty includes the new vaccine. Publicly, doctors and government health officials uniformly support the vaccine. But others, including some in the medical community, have raised questions over whether the vaccine has been tested long enough to say that it is perfectly safe for everyone.</p>
<p>A doctor survey in August in the U.K. -- much quoted by vaccine skeptics -- showed that out of 216 general practitioners polled, seven in 10 said they were concerned there had not been sufficient trials for the vaccine, and three in 10 GPs said they would not get it.</p>
<p>Uncertainty is magnified in our culture of cynicism and contrarianism, and by alternative media and the online world, even on the social networking site Facebook: Refusing the H1N1 Swine Flu Vaccine, one page is called.</p>
<p>All of this, says Karen Sternheimer, a sociologist at the University of Southern California, is powered by growing mistrust of public institutions, certainly in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Canada.</p>
<p>"A new credibility gap seems to be growing, where people don't trust leaders to tell the truth," she said. "This could also lead to panic if people are afraid but don't feel they can trust science or medicine to provide a solution."</p>
<p>Even as thousands flock to get themselves and their children vaccinated, debate continues, especially among parents trying to do what's best for their kids. Parents fear doing nothing and their children contracting the virus and dying; or they fear vaccination will produce a side effect that will do harm.</p>
<p>We are motivated to act by what psychologists call sins of commission or omission. University of Western Ontario psychologist Leora Swartzman says most people fear actively doing something that could, in theory, hurt their child (commission) as opposed to doing nothing and harm resulting from it (omission).</p>
<p>"A parent thinks, 'I can't bear to imagine that something bad would happen to my kid because of something I did,' " she said. "But if I don't do anything, and something happens, they can say, it's fate.</p>
<p>"Rationally, it's the same physical outcome, but we make decisions in part to help protect ourselves from anticipated emotions."</p>
<p>Bieling suggests agonizing over whether to vaccinate is misplaced stress, because people are highly unlikely to either die from H1N1, or have health complications from the shot.</p>
<p>"From a statistical, rational perspective, it is not an important decision -- the risk is low either way."</p>
<p>He said he'll get the shot, especially because he works in a hospital, but he knows he is not in a priority group so he will have to wait his turn.</p>
<p>"I say: figure out when you should go, and get the shot," he said.</p>
<p>"Should you cancel all things, pull your kids out of school to line up? My advice is, no. Take a deep breath and get it done in a reasonable way.</p>
<p>"Look, the risk you face driving to get the swine flu shot might be higher than from the swine flu itself."</p>

</p>
<p>Hamilton and Halton are expected to run out of flu vaccine in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>There will be no flu shots for the general public next week as health officials try to get those most at risk immunized before they run out of vaccine.</p>
<p>Hamilton is clamping down on who gets the shots after determining one-third of the vaccinations given so far have been to people who aren't high priority.</p>
<p>"I'd like people to think about what they're doing if they go to those lines if they're not in the priority groups," said Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health. "They're putting those people in danger."</p>
<p>Please do not come to our lineups for vaccine if you're not eligible."</p>
<p>Halton has also vaccinated a "significant number" of people who don't qualify to receive the H1N1 flu shot yet, but aren't going to the same extremes as Hamilton to stop it.</p>
<p>"The key message is the clinics are for priority groups, but having said that, anyone coming through the doors, we're immunizing them," said Dr. Bob Nosal, medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The main reason for the tough stance in Hamilton is that it has just enough vaccine left to immunize those at highest risk. It's important to get them protected because Hamilton is one of only five health units in Ontario with widespread influenza activity.</p>
<p>Both Hamilton and Halton are ready to give the vaccine to the general public but predict their clinics could close sometime over the next two weeks as federal supplies dwindle. The province is expected to send drastically smaller shipments of vaccine than needed for one to two weeks because the manufacturer was asked to make unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women. The shots being given to everyone else have adjuvant, which boosts immune response.</p>
<p>"We are geared up to do large numbers at four sites but the clinics may not be able to operate," said Nosal. "Half of the physicians in Halton are willing and able to give the vaccine but we have no vaccine to give them."</p>
<p>The new rules in Hamilton mean parents and older siblings will no longer get the shot when they bring kids aged six months to under five in for vaccination.</p>
<p>"We were allowing family members who were waiting hours in line to get the vaccine," said Mackie. "We are cracking down at the clinics and won't be giving vaccine to people who aren't eligible."</p>
<p>Hamilton won't be checking to make sure that people are telling the truth when they say they are pregnant, have chronic health conditions, work in health care or are caregivers of a baby under six months old.</p>
<p>"We have to trust the public," said Mackie. "We really need people to be honest."</p>
<p>Hamilton has so far received 81,500 doses of vaccine. Public health has immunized 20,000 people so far and has given some vaccine to hospitals and large family practices.</p>
<p>There are no clinics this weekend and Mackie believes there is enough left for all the clinics scheduled next week.</p>
<p>Halton got 73,000 doses and, after clinics this weekend, will only have about 40,000 doses left. The region has the capacity to do 12,000 shots a day so it could run out as early as Thursday.</p>
<p>It's unknown when the next shipment will come in but Nosal only expects it to be about 5,000 to 8,000 doses, which wouldn't even last a day.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a huge impact," said Nosal. "We will need vaccine or we'll be out by the end of the week."</p>
<p>Hospitals are already having trouble keeping up with the number of staff wanting the vaccine. Hamilton Health Sciences vaccinated 900 of its 10,000 staff in one day while St. Joseph's has immunized about 1,500 of its 5,000 employees.</p>
<p>"There's been a very significant demand for the vaccine," said Dr. David Higgins, chief of staff. "It has been frustrating for them."</p>
<p>PC leader Tim Hudak called on the premier to ease the lineups that have been as long as five hours in Hamilton and to provide better access to the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Families are rightfully angry and deeply frustrated," he said. "This is not acceptable."</p>
<p>But public health says there's little the province could do to shorten the waits and that the major worry right now is the federal shortage of vaccines.</p>
<p>The supply is expected to go back to normal in two weeks but Hamilton appears to be at the peak of the second wave of H1N1 right now.</p>
<p>"The ideal scenario would be to inject a good amount of the population before there is significant spread of the virus," said Nosal.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Private clinics eye H1N1 shots; Will help reach more people, companies say</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>864 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto Late</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>As public-health authorities struggle to cope with the onslaught of Canadians wanting an H1N1 flu shot, private health-care operators are questioning why they have been barred from delivering the vaccine in workplaces.</p>
<p>With employers -- and not taxpayers -- picking up the tab, such private clinics could expedite the rollout of the vaccine, potentially reach more people and make the whole process more convenient for many Canadians, the companies say.</p>
<p>They routinely provide the seasonal-flu vaccine in offices and on factory floors across the country and say they are being flooded with calls from corporate clients who want the same service with the pandemic vaccine. Most provinces, however, have deemed that the pandemic vaccine will be administered solely by public-health offices and doctors, citing in part the complex preparation and paperwork needed for the pandemic shots. With public clinics often open only for a few hours at a time -- and equipped with limited supplies of vaccine -- people have had to wait hours to get a shot.</p>
<p>"The fact that H1N1 clinics for workplaces are not being encouraged -- to put it mildly -- is counter-productive," said Luis Rodrigues, president of Occu-Med Health Services Inc., based in London, Ont. "If we have hundreds of people congregating in one place, why not do a clinic for those hundreds of people? ... We're actually relieving the burden off the public system."</p>
<p>For the next few days, though, the question of who administers the vaccine, and where, will likely be subsumed by the consequences of a sharp decline in supply of the main vaccine expected next week.</p>
<p>Even longer queues are expected in the wake of the federal government's announcement that only about 600,000 doses -- not the two million to three million expected -- will be shipped next week. The reason is that <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the company that manufactures Canada's shots, had to divert some of its production to make 1.5 million doses of vaccine without the immune-boosting adjuvant.</p>
<p>The special order was in response to concerns that adjuvanted vaccine had not been tested on pregnant women, though the World Health Organization said yesterday that a new review of hundreds of thousands of cases had shown the adjuvant to be safe for expectant mothers.</p>
<p>About six million of the 50 million doses ordered by the government will have been shipped by the end of the weekend. The production is expected to jump back up to 3.5 million doses the week after next, and federal officials still believe they can have everyone who wants a shot immunized before Christmas, as scheduled.</p>
<p>So-called "third-party" health providers like Occu-Med have for decades set up vaccination clinics in workplaces to provide seasonal flu shots to employees, with employers paying for the nurses who give the injections.</p>
<p>Companies do not question that the H1N1 shot has been delivered exclusively by public health for the first, high-risk segment of patients, but say they should be brought in for the rest of the population.</p>
<p>British Columbia will, in fact, allow private clinics once there is enough vaccine available to begin immunizing healthy adults, said Gillian Rhodes, a spokeswoman for the B.C. Healthy Living Ministry, although she did not say when that would happen.</p>
<p>Some other provinces seem to be considering a similar policy, but so far none have committed to doing so, said Cindy Hitsman, a vice-president with the Victorian Order of Nurses, which runs flu clinics countrywide.</p>
<p>"It is definitely a mechanism to get more people immunized and reduce those line-ups," she said. "When you consider people are taking time off work to get their shots, they might wait in line for eight hours. That's a whole day's work that is lost."</p>
<p>David Jensen, a spokesman for the Ontario Health Ministry, said his province has not ruled out allowing workplace immunization at some point, but said the policy is different for the pandemic flu partly because its delivery is generally more complex. For instance, he said, the adjuvant has to be added to the vaccine by health professionals, and the resulting solution injected within 24 hours.</p>
<p>Plus, nurses and doctors are required to record information on each recipient, such as the lot number of the vaccine and any immediate adverse side effects, Mr. Jensen said.</p>
<p>But nurses employed by private operators could easily follow those requirements, said Cliff Langin, owner of East Coast Mobile Medical Inc. in Dartmouth, N.S., which runs flu clinics in offices and plants across Atlantic Canada.</p>
<p>"I know [the provinces] want to do it themselves," Mr. Langin said. "But they may find they have taken on more than they can handle ... It's a huge undertaking."</p>
<p>When high-risk people are vaccinated and it comes time to immunize the general public, "it's something governments should be revisiting," echoed Shirley White of Mississauga, Ont.-based Oncidium Health.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>In and out in 30 minutes or less; Thanks to appointment system, getting flu shot is a snap in Brantford and Sault Ste. Marie</b>
</div><div>Rob Ferguson    </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>476 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star    </div>
</p>
<p>How would you like to get an H1N1 shot without waiting in line for hours and hours, just by making an appointment on the Internet or on the phone?</p>
<p>Move to Brantford or Sault Ste. Marie.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the Brant County Health Unit set up a web-based system for regular flu shot appointments and it's paying big dividends this year in use for the H1N1 vaccine, program manager Jill Fediurek said Friday.</p>
<p>"Nobody likes waiting," she noted, saying Brantford-area residents usually spend no more than 30 minutes at the public clinic - including 15 minutes of waiting time after the shot to see if the recipient has an adverse reaction.</p>
<p>"We're getting a lot of positive feedback."</p>
<p>A telephone-based system was started by the Algoma Health Unit serving the Sault Ste. Marie area six years ago for regular flu shots to avoid lineups that were getting "completely out of control." It is now being used to coordinate 1,600 H1N1 vaccinations a day, medical officer of health Dr. Allan Northan told the Star.</p>
<p>"You can save a lot of chaos," he added. "People who say it can't be done are people who don't want to take the time to figure it out. It could work anywhere big or small, you just have to figure it out for your volume and geography. The technology is available."</p>
<p>Contrast that with Toronto and the GTA, where thousands of people turned out for shots this week and waited for hours, sometimes in vain as clinics closed early. Toronto officials are now handing out appointment slips to people in line - but they must come back later.</p>
<p>The delays have prompted Progressive Conservative Leader Tim Hudak to call on Premier Dalton McGuinty to "fix this mess."</p>
<p>Referring to the long lineups at Toronto-area clinics, Fediurek said it appears the appointment system is an idea whose time has come, particularly in an area like hers. The Brantford clinic is open from 9 a.m. to 7: 30 p.m. with appointments every five minutes, serving 650 people a day.</p>
<p>"Bear in mind we've had a couple of years to fine-tune this," she added. "It's something to think about, but maybe not in the middle of something like this."</p>
<p>The Brant and Sault systems also have the advantage of allowing officials to monitor demand, add on more clinics or decide how many nurses are needed at any one time, saving money and resources.</p>

<p>Ottawa -- Something is growing in this country other than the serpentine queues outside flu shot clinics. It's the federal civil service and that relentless expansion is particularly embarrassing at a time when frightened citizens are turning to their government for help.</p>
<p>There's no direct connection between the length of H1N1 lines and the number of public servants. But there should be a relationship between the bureaucracy's size and the quality of services it delivers.</p>
<p>That correlation isn't apparent in the muddled management of Canada's largest-ever immunization. Confusion, the slow delivery of vaccine and new warnings about short supply are frustrating Canadians while exposing Conservatives to viral attacks.</p>
<p>Opposition parties are convinced Stephen Harper is politically susceptible to the flu.</p>
<p>They accuse Conservatives of spending more time and money on partisan stimulus advertising than informing Canadians about H1N1 or ensuring a smooth, adequate vaccine supply.</p>
<p>Of course, the charge is laced with the usual hyperbole. But as Conservative strategist Tom Flanagan cynically noted recently, political propositions don't have to be true, just plausible. This one is steeped in enough fact and fear to be a threat.</p>
<p>It couldn't matter less to pregnant women, worried parents or patients with underlying conditions that Ottawa and the provinces share responsibility for health or that ample doses are on order. What matters is the hours, days or months they must wait for shots.</p>
<p>Wearying for those ready to roll up their sleeves, the delays are a Stephen Harper headache.</p>
<p>Fair or not, the constant news presence of Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq and David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, is morphing into the message that the pandemic is Ottawa's problem.</p>
<p>Bad for Conservatives, that's worrying for the bureaucracy. Every fatality and each new glitch is another blow to a civil service struggling with a reputation, ruined by the gun registry fiasco, that it's incapable of providing programs in real time and at reasonable cost.</p>
<p>So it's awkward as well as revealing that the federal payroll is growing many times faster than inflation at a time when deficits are ballooning and the immunization effort is under unflattering scrutiny. Following a decade-long trend, the number of public employees grew last year by 4.5 per cent, or about 9,000 jobs.</p>
<p>Fortunately for Conservatives now defending their flu strategy, the health department - along with defence, border services and public safety - benefited from some of that growth. Still, the numbers that count most and the ones the government is pressed to explain, are in the crowds outside the clinics.</p>
<p>It's self-evident to those now milling outside immunization sites that there must be a better way. Waiting for hours only to be told to come back tomorrow isn't just annoying: it strains the bonds between state and citizens. It's evidence this government and civil servants weren't properly prepared for a test predicted months ago and now proving to be so alarming.</p>
<p>A crisis mismanaged is an opportunity missed. Politicians could have seized the moment to remind Canadians that there are some things only government can do. Bureaucrats could have risen to the considerable H1N1 challenge by proving to the country that public servants are still willing and able to do some things well.</p>
<p>Instead, political rivals are finger pointing while Canadians seethe. Instead, mandarins are building empires while the country stands in line for services.</p>
<p>James Travers' column appears Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.</p>

<p>A downtown Toronto clinic is offering its patients H1N1 shots without a wait, according to CTV News.</p>
<p>Medcan Clinic, which received a shipment of the vaccine from Toronto Public Health, is offering free shots and no lineup, as long as patients are in one of the province's designated high-risk groups.</p>
<p>To become one of the clinic's 13,000 members, clients are required to pay $2,300 for a "comprehensive assessment" that isn't covered by the Ontario Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>However, the York St. clinic could have its supply of vaccines confiscated if it doesn't adequately prove to public health officials that only priority groups are being inoculated.</p>

<p>BLOOMINGDALE, Ont. -- Leanne and Paul Hergott knew their only daughter Sarah was fragile and would require constant care for life.</p>
<p>But they never thought Sarah would die suddenly of a common virus when she was just 12.</p>
<p>Less than a week after waking up with a fever, Sarah took her last breath on Thursday in her mother's arms. At the emergency department of Grand River Hospital, the day after she became sick, the Hergotts were told their daughter had the H1N1 flu virus. "They diagnosed her right away with H1N1, it was so severe," Leanne said.</p>
<p>"It's just very scary that it can hit so hard and fast," Leanne said.</p>
<p>Sarah had Angelman syndrome, a genetic disorder causing mental and physical disabilities and often misdiagnosed as cerebral palsy or autism. She suffered from seizures, eating and sleep disorders, and difficulty walking.</p>
<p>About a year and a half ago, she developed pneumonia and suffered a massive seizure. She was on life support for a week and never fully recovered, with colds routinely turning into pneumonia.</p>
<p>Regional medical officer of health Dr. Liana Nolan could not say if Sarah died of H1N1. "We've had no confirmed deaths due to H1N1."</p>
<p>However, only cases confirmed by lab tests are reported to public health. "It's possible that there are deaths that don't get reported to us because that test was not done."</p>
<p>Sarah did not have the nose swab used to test for the virus, her parents said. She didn't get the H1N1 vaccination. "It wasn't available until this week and she was sick on Saturday," Leanne said.</p>

<p>Before this week, it was only the official line from health officials. This week, tragedy turned it into a grassroots meme that spread with a speed approximating the H1N1 virus itself. When Evan Frustaglio, healthy and 13, was killed by swine flu on Monday, a danger that had only recently seemed abstract to many Canadians became very real and very scary. While the experts correctly cautioned against panic - Frustaglio's death was so jarring precisely because it was rare - it appeared to turn a large number of wafflers into ardent proponents of vaccination. Perhaps the sad loss of one young life will save others.</p>

</p>
<p>I was doing a slow boil Monday night in the midst of my three-hour wait at a local H1N1 vaccination clinic. The clinic was a popular site and I was encouraged that so many Winnipeggers turned out to get the shot.</p>
<p>The steamy feeling was born of a different source of impatience. The asthmatic teenager had gone to get me a coffee at the <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> in the mall about a half hour earlier. Finally, I could see the top of his head above the crowd but joy dissolved when he stopped short and his hand shot out.</p>
<p>It was empty. I really had wanted that coffee.</p>
<p>Turned out the teenager dropped his tea and I got my brew.</p>
<p>Fast forward to Thursday afternoon. I was struck by the hot tea-drop as a pandemic-planning metaphor when Health Minister Theresa Oswald finally got to the jaw-dropping announcement that the feds would be shipping "significantly less" vaccine our way.</p>
<p>An adjustment in GSK's production meant vaccine shortages, and the very real possibility mass vaccination would stop, temporarily.</p>
<p>That crunching sound you heard, folks, was the best laid plan of mice and mathematical models backing hard into a brick wall.</p>
<p>After convincing a justifiably skeptical public to get the shot, with waiting lines stretched in response to the deaths of two young Ontario kids, health authorities are closing clinics temporarily in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>In suppressed panic -- we are Canadians -- the people responded in kind Friday; lineups at Winnipeg clinics began three hours prior to opening for the day.</p>
<p>No one was more deflated than Gerry Delorme, head disaster manager for the province. His initial H1N1 pandemic plan was based on the capacity in the province-wide system to deliver 220,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine weekly.</p>
<p>Given that the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority says it can deliver a maximum 60,000 doses a week (which it will top this week), I'm not clear on how that is possible, short of calling in the military or deputizing civilians as vaccinators.</p>
<p>But Delorme's plan could have seen all Manitobans immunized within five weeks.</p>
<p>And Manitoba might have been one of the few places on this continent to have got its population entirely protected against the disease on time.</p>
<p>Now, maybe half of us can get vaccinated.</p>
<p>University of Manitoba infectious diseases specialist Dr. Ethan Rubinstein and co-researchers built a mathematical model, taking into account what was learned of H1N1 in its first wave here last spring. They believe the peak of this flu -- defined as the marked rise of hospitalizations, ICU admissions and deaths -- will start mid-November and hit its maximum Dec. 5.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, Delorme looked like a guy who had just watched his spread sheets go up in flames. All of the cogs and gears carefully tapped into place, collapsing into pile of scrap metal because the vaccine doesn't come.</p>
<p>It means that not even the 320,000 Manitobans estimated to be at high risk of suffering from H1N1 will be done in the next two weeks, the point at which Delorme had hoped the doors would be thrown open to the general public.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that we've had a pretty good look, folks, at what pandemics do to systems, models and plans.</p>
<p>The plans, such as they are, have worked reasonably well in Manitoba, until the supply chain busted a link. In advance of H1N1 appearing, the federal government and its vaccine manufacturer, GSK, had already run a mock trial to ensure the safety and integrity of the production. Vaccine production for H1N1 began impressively quick, especially after it was found a chemical booster was needed to improve effectiveness of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Initially, rollout was to start mid-November to protect people in time for the typical onset of seasonal flu, which is in December.</p>
<p>But H1N1 came back early to Canada, beginning in British Columbia at the start of the school year. And the vaccine rollout started last week. Even with the jump start, some infectious diseases specialists point out that many Canadians will not be vaccinated by the start of H1N1's peak. We simply didn't have enough time to pump out vaccine.</p>
<p>And now, if this were the deadly killer seen in 1918/19 -- even with the blessing of modern medicine with its vaccines and antibiotics, improved urban infrastructure and public health systems -- the veneer of civil society would be shredding around us. The meek Canadian archetype, reduced to a polite fiction.</p>
<p>But H1N1 is only a real threat to just over a quarter of Manitoba's population, those considered high risk. There may be still time, if vaccine roll out picks up again, to get to most of them.</p>
<p>Canadian pandemic planning this time around came up short, but we will dodge the bullet. My question for the planners is what, besides a vaccine, can we muster should a real killer decide to invade?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Clinics Cancelled Next Week; Priority Only; Shipments expected to increase soon</b>
</div><div>Kenyon Wallace And Erin De Coste    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>713 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Ontario Public Health officials have cancelled H1N1 flu shot clinics for the general public next week due to a nationwide shortage of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The province's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King, said she was expecting Ontario to receive 722,000 doses, but now will only get 170,000 doses of the adjuvanted vaccine and 86,800 doses of the unadjuvanted vaccine because of lower than expected production by the vaccine's manufacturer, GlaxoSmithKline Inc.</p>
<p>"It's disappointing we aren't getting more vaccine next week," Dr. King told reporters at a media conference yesterday.</p>
<p>That means Toronto's clinics, which were supposed to start offering vaccinations to the general public on Monday, will remain open only for priority groups, which include the elderly, young children, pregnant women and people with chronic conditions. Toronto Public Health will be questioning people in line to ensure only those in priority groups get the vaccine first.</p>
<p>"We will not be immunizing people who do not fall under the priority groups," Dr. King said. "If you are not in a priority group please be patient and respect the sequencing.</p>
<p>"Obviously, it would be desirable to continue to have the supply we had, but I think the strategy we agreed on is the best way right now to mitigate serious illness and death as result of infection of H1N1."</p>
<p>Ontario has received close to 2.2 million doses of the vaccine to date, out of six million released nationally by the federal government. The province was supposed to receive one million doses next week.</p>
<p>The reduced supply also means the vaccine will be available in limited quantities at doctor's offices and hospitals, where inoculations are supposed to be offered the week of Nov. 9, said Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's Medical Officer of Health.</p>
<p>Ontario is expected to see shipments increase soon, Dr. King said, with most people able to get the vaccine by Christmas.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, lineups at Metro Hall -- one of two flu clinics open in the city yesterday -- stretched for blocks even though Toronto Public Health handed out time-stamped tickets to ease delays.</p>
<p>Marnie Jennings, seven-and-a-half-months pregnant with her third child, waited for three hours in the rain to get a 2 p.m. ticket.</p>
<p>"We just received a ticket but it's not numbered," she said. "So now over 350 of us who received this red 2 p.m. ticket will be basically arguing for space. They're trying their best but I don't believe it's as organized as it could be."</p>
<p>The would-be patients did their best to stay dry. Plenty of umbrellas protected even those who forgot their own. A boy wearing a green raincoat and yellow boots played with a toy train while one father struggled to keep his toddlers occupied with a Lion King colouring book.</p>
<p>"I have to give props to the people that are doing their jobs and staying extra hours," said nurse Sabrina Bennett. She waited for almost three hours to get her 17-month-old daughter immunized.</p>
<p>"We've already seen some tensions rise at the end of the line. Everybody feels like they're a priority. Everybody's scared."</p>
<p>Lindsay Harris, with 10-month-old daughter Juliet, was not impressed.</p>
<p>"I've been waiting almost two hours. We knew that it would be quite a wait, but this is not fun," she said. "The fact that they've known about the swine flu and they've been warning us about an outbreak for months now, and the fact that they just don't seem to be prepared for this vaccination, is mind boggling."</p>
<p>Toronto Public Health vaccinated about 5,000 people yesterday and can administer close to 2,000 vaccinations in one clinic each day.</p>
<p>Toronto's second wave of the virus is in full swing. Toronto Public Health report 115 cases since the beginning of September, half of them in the last week.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Several hundred people patiently waited hours for the doors of the city's only H1N1 flu shot clinic to open at 9 a.m. Friday at the former College Avenue Public School.</p>
<p>People came prepared with coffee, lawn chairs, video games and umbrellas. Kids played in puddles and fallen leaves. Babies slept in strollers.</p>
<p>Adults chatted on cellphones to pass the time.</p>
<p>"I can't see the school, let alone the doors," a woman was overheard saying on a cellphone toward the end of the line, which snaked its way well off school property to the east and then made its way north on Lynwood Avenue.</p>
<p>"There has to be 2,000 people in front of me," a man said while also on a cell.</p>
<p>Joel Barr was first in line. He arrived at 6 a.m. and held a place for his wife, Dianne Dobbins, and their three-year-old son, Brendan, an asthmatic.</p>
<p>"He has a medical predisposition, so this is precautionary," Dobbins said.</p>
<p>Those in high-risk groups, such as pregnant women, children between the ages of six months and five years old, people with chronic health conditions, and health-care workers were to be treated first. However, plans have changed slightly.</p>
<p>"We are encouraging those of high priority to come down and get the shot but we won't turn anyone away," Jan Craig, spokesperson for Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health, said Friday morning.</p>
<p>In Windsor, the public health unit there began turning away patients who were not high risk because of long lines and the risk of running out of vaccinations.</p>
<p>And late Friday afternoon, Ontario's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Dr. Arlene King, said that beginning next week all clinics will turn away those who are not high risk.</p>
<p>Craig said the local health unit's plan hasn't changed - yet.</p>
<p>"We're planning our strategy. We'll let you know what changes," she said. "We're just trying to find time to think."</p>
<p>Debbie Davison, also an asthmatic, arrived at 9 a.m. She was last in line when the doors opened. But people continued to steadily file in behind her.</p>
<p>"As long as it takes," Davison said when asked how long she was willing to wait. "I knew the line would be long. And you're going to wait next week, too.</p>
<p>"If I don't have the shot, God forbid what might happen."</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health has received two allotments of the vaccine. The first was 12,000 doses and the second was 14,500. Neither is adjuvant free. It's been suggested pregnant women wait for the adjuvant-free vaccination, which is scheduled to arrive in Guelph within two weeks.</p>
<p>"We should be OK for the next few days," Craig said.</p>
<p>But the health unit did say in a release late Friday afternoon that it "will likely face a shortage the week after next."</p>
<p>To meet demand, the health unit expanded Friday's clinic by three hours and added an additional clinic from 9:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. today. Clinics will then run on a daily basis next week.</p>
<p>"We're pleased with the turnout. We expected a large crowd. We're prepared," Craig said.</p>
<p>"They may have vaccines on site, but they took almost 45 minutes to move me from registration . . . to getting the actual shot," said Angela Jewel, who is 35 weeks pregnant.</p>
<p>Every recipient must be registered before they receive their vaccination.</p>
<p>People curious about wait times can stay up to date on Twitter.com. By noon Friday, the estimated wait time was between three and four hours.</p>
<p>Tammy McNabb arrived at 8:20 a.m. with three young sons. Four hours later, they had yet to enter the school.</p>
<p>"It's been cold, wet, painful," she said as rain fell on her single umbrella for four. "Is it worth it? I guess we'll know when winter's over and we didn't get sick."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Let's approach this H1N1 ‘panic' sensibly</b>
</div><div>Tara Klager   </div>
<div>679 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>Amid all the misinformation and disinformation going round and round the media in recent weeks about H1N1, you could be forgiven for flipping over this page of the paper and moving doggedly on to something else.</p>
<p>It's not like we haven't been absolutely swamped with statistics and talking heads spouting off on every blessed angle of the story – angles and angles of angles – ad nauseam. Not only are we hearing what's going on in other countries, but because of our own peculiarities we Canadians get treated to the sagas of the various provinces and all their endlessly evolving "pandemic plans." Add to that the initiatives of some of our native communities – and good on them, I say – and the various stories emerging from other select populations and you end up with a populace overdosing on pandemic panic.</p>
<p>Now there are generally two responses to panic. One is to get uber-freaked and run about yelling and gesticulating until either exhaustion or fate takes a hand. The other is to gradually harden until even well-considered commentary bounces off your shiny shell. Either way, it's not optimal.</p>
<p>Recent news items regarding the just-approved vaccine are a case in point. For the freaked out contingent, this announcement suddenly provided sharp focus for their anxiety. Who should get the vaccine? Where should they go to get it? How effective is it? Can I get it now? How about now? Now?</p>
<p>As irritating as these people are, at least they're being conscientious. I was in a church washroom the other day in close quarters with a woman clearly from this group. She eschewed contacting anything with her hand. She nudged the stall door open with her foot and swung it closed again the same way. She'd a mitt full of paper towel when she went in and it was obvious by the rustling and quiet swearing (in church yet!) that she was attempting to latch the door with swaddled fingers. When she emerged, after a brief interlude of more rustling and subdued exasperation, she managed to wash and dry her hands and open the door and exit the crowded loo without touching a single surface in a display of nimbleness and flexibility that would thrill the heart of a Chinese contortionist. It all seemed a bit much, particularly in view of the numerous hand-sanitizer stations standing like sentries in every hallway.</p>
<p>It's possible I'm prematurely curmudgeonly but to live in such a state of heightened anxiety cannot be counted among civilization's attractions.</p>
<p>But while those people are irritating – though unintentionally amusing – the folks on the other end of the scale are infuriating. Refusing to get a vaccine – one that will not only protect you but the people around you – shows a level of numbskulledness of truly epic proportions. And to do it "on principle!"</p>
<p>One nitwit of my acquaintance – who incidentally didn't vaccinate her children – lisped at me that vaccines aren't safe and questioned the need for a widespread immunization plan. Now call me crazy but generally speaking, if someone of suitable qualifications and gravitas tells me this may save my life and protect my loved ones, I'm rolling up my sleeve and sitting where they tell me to. To do otherwise seems gravest folly.</p>
<p>We've lost touch with the reality of these diseases. There are people out there who believe influenza is just a bad cold. It isn't. This virus moves fast and can kill in a matter of days. In light of the recent deaths in Toronto and Ottawa of children – children! – due to H1N1, it is our duty to undertake every measure that will protect our fellow citizens. Wash your hands, stay home when you're sick – no one needs you that badly – and for the love of our families and neighbours, when your turn for the needle comes, sit down, brace up and take it like a grown-up.</p>

<p>The editorial ran in Thursday's Waterloo Region Record</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is spreading rapidly. So, too, is the terrible news that it killed a 13-year-old boy in Toronto and a 10-year-old girl in Cornwall. If you're like most people, you're wrestling with the question of whether or not to be vaccinated, fearful of a mysterious new illness yet uncertain if the remedy is entirely safe. But if you're like most people, the answer is obvious.</p>
<p>Yes. Do it. Roll up your sleeve. Stand in line with your child at a public clinic next week even if it takes a few hours. Do not panic. Do not blow the threat of this virus out of proportion. But get the needle. It's safe. When all the risks are balanced, when the realization is grasped of just how widespread and deadly this pandemic could be if nothing is done to stop it, the only reasonable choice for most of the population is to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Consider what we know, and remember that most of the following information comes from public health departments. The H1N1 virus in not like the kind of seasonal flu virus that sweeps Canada each winter. So we need to be more vigilant and active when facing it.</p>
<p>While much of the population has developed a degree of immunity to seasonal flu, H1N1 is a new, circulating virus. The population has little or no resistance to it.</p>
<p>Because of this, while the typical seasonal flu is related to between 4,000 and 8,000 deaths in Canada each year, the H1N1 virus could kill even more people, depending on the severity of the virus.</p>
<p>Moreover, H1N1 flu could make those who catch it sicker, for a longer period of time than the seasonal flu would.</p>

</p>
<p>I don't feel like writing a column today. I don't really have a good idea and I ‘m not in a good writing space. It's like my writing mojo has gone missing, the combination of inspiration and talent from which 650 words of magic occasionally appear.</p>
<p>I have done a lot of writing lately and I feel like my word tank is empty. When this happens, I'm never sure on how to refill it. Alphabet soup, maybe.</p>
<p>Usually in this situation, I try a few nifty tricks. The first is to find an old idea and try to recycle it into something kinda new. Surely, for example, I've written something funny or introspective about Halloween sometime in the last 10 years of on-again-off-again column writing?</p>
<p>Hmm, a quick scan of the archives indicates that I'm not in a position to plagiarize myself on this issue.</p>
<p>So here's my Halloween column idea: My kids, both girls, are going trick or treating this year dressed as a dead witch and Spider-Man, which has me concerned about their sociopathic tendencies and understanding of gender roles.</p>
<p>I will go as Darth Vader because I am their father. We will go to all the houses on our block and then engage in a two-month argument about the timing and volume of candy consumption.</p>
<p>Boo is just a short form for Boo hoo, the sound parents make at Halloween.</p>
<p>My second fallback position is to write about my life. My kids must have done something mildly amusing or perhaps I've committed a stupid enough act in the last seven days that others might get a kick out of it. But then, I wrote about my children last week and right now my life seems slightly overwhelming: between H1N1, my Dad's cancer treatment and the chaos of day-to-day existence, I could easily spew an entire column of petulant whining instead of, you know, just this paragraph.</p>
<p>The most remarkable thing that happened to me recently was a food shopping trip with my 91-year-old grandmother who, despite being a woman of reasonable financial wealth, buys instant coffee and packaged bologna because everything else is too expensive. She's not cheap - she's very generous, actually - but she's learned to live life a certain way and she can't change. I wish I was more like that.</p>
<p>So the next possibility is to canvass the world for something funny and reprint it here, along with some half witty observations or jokes about the incident. It used to be hard to find these stories, but now I can just head to the major news sites on the internet and check out the "most read" stories: the masses always choose meaningless ephemera over real news or important issues.</p>
<p>But the news seems remarkably unfunny today. A farmer in Nova Scotia had 24,000 kilograms of hay stolen, but the only thing truly amusing was his quote: "That's a real kick in the arse."</p>
<p>I'd be interested in knowing how one sells a giant bale of stolen hay. I mean, that isn't something that you can sell on street corner.</p>
<p>"Psst . . . Want to buy some hay?"</p>
<p>OK, the final alternative is to just keep ranting, throwing various thoughts and ideas at the screen like some kind of Jackson Pollock column in the vain hope that once I'm done something coherent will have emerged, something greater than the sum of its parts.</p>
<p>I didn't feel like writing a column today but I did it anyway. I think Darth Vader, my grandmother and maybe even the hay farmer would be proud.</p>
<p>Either that or he'd kick me the arse.</p>

<p>Boston Bruins head coach Claude Julien is OK with the way his captain is playing, but certainly not blown away.</p>
<p>"Good," said Julien to the Boston Globe when asked about the play of Zdeno Chara so far this season. "But can be better. He knows that. He's been good. There are some games where we've seen him be dominant like we have in the past. But so far, he hasn't been dominant night in and night out like he has been. He's frustrated a little bit, too."</p>
<p>Chara has yet to score in Boston's 11 games (with six assists) while averaging 24:34 of ice time per match.</p>
<p>"His whole game, at times, has been up and down a little bit," Julien continued. "He's never been terrible. But there are some nights where I'd say he's been OK. When you talk about Z, for our team to have success, we'd like to see him the way he was last year -- being a stellar defenceman, being stingy, and being a defenceman that every team hated playing against."</p>
<p>Milestone for Crow: Marc Crawford of the Dallas Stars coached his 1,000th career NHL regular-season game on Thursday night when the Stars faced Florida.</p>
<p>He became the 15th coach in history to reach that milestone.</p>
<p>"I think everything you ever do contributes to who you are, and I'm very happy and proud of what I've been able to do in my career," Crawford said to the Dallas News. "So whether it has been a good experience or a bad experience, hopefully, it's made me a better coach today."</p>
<p>Crawford won a Stanley Cup with Colorado in 1996. He then moved onto Vancouver, where he became the winningest coach in Canucks history, Crawford then coached two seasons with the L.A. Kings before being fired.</p>
<p>He was hired by Dallas this past summer.</p>
<p>Leclaire better: After enduring a long week with the flu, Ottawa Senators goaltender Pascal Leclaire says he almost felt like his old self again Friday.</p>
<p>Leclaire believed the flu was behind him when he attempted to play in Wednesday's 4-3 win over the Florida Panthers, but only got through a period before yanking himself.</p>
<p>"I had a little bit of a relapse," he said. "I thought I was feeling good, but once the game started, I was feeling a little dizzy. It's not ideal to have a dizzy goalie in there. I could have tried to be the hero and everything, but I didn't feel comfortable enough."</p>
<p>While he was never worried that he contracted the H1N1 virus, he was surprised at how strong the flu was.</p>
<p>"I guess the cold is just really strong this year. I guess it's a man's cold, a man's flu, just like in the old days."</p>
<p>Ice chips: Flu-stricken Dustin Boyd is back skating with the Calgary Flames. The 23-year-old missed one game and four days of practice with the illness ... The injury-plagued Detroit Red Wings landed more bad news Friday as winger Valtteri Filppula is out for six-to-eight weeks with a broken wrist. ... Daniel Briere left Philadelphia Flyers practice early Friday because of what head coach John Stevens called "a lower-body injury." Briere missed a good chunk of last season with groin and abdominal issues ... It's been a hot start for Coyotes goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov -- he earned his league-leading third shutout of the season this week and tied his career-high in only 10 Phoenix' games.</p>

<p>Telework, in which employees work from home while staying in touch with the office via telephone, e-mail and other forms of communication, is far from a new concept, yet people haven't taken it up in nearly the numbers that its proponents think they should.</p>
<p>A catalyst such as a severe outbreak of H1N1 could force the issue, however, as employers could find themselves relying on telework programs to keep their business running in a time of crisis, said Bob Klay of Klay Information Management Consulting Ltd.</p>
<p>Telework could help maintain business continuity in many situations, be it a reduced workforce due to illness or unforeseen events like the loss of a building or loss of IT, Klay told a recent Calgary business breakfast forum.</p>
<p>Keynote speaker Peter Tertzakian, chief energy economist of ARC Financial Corp. and bestselling author, said he views telework as a part of a broader societal change.Change could be brought about by many reasons. One of them is the high price of gasoline.</p>
<p>"There's no question that high energy prices are going to be a catalyst, particularly high oil prices, and I believe we're looking at the trigger point right in the face right now," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Take precautions with kids on Halloween; No need to confine them over flu fears</b>
</div><div>Compiled by Joanne Laucius   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>703 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>E7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>

<p>Parents wondering whether it's safe to let their little ghosts and goblins go trick-or-treating have nothing to worry about, as long as they take reasonable precautions, says Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones. Here are the answers to some other questions you may have before the kids head out tonight.</p>
<p>For parents of young children, H1N1 might be the scariest thing about Halloween this year.</p>
<p>But even Butler-Jones says there's no reason to let flu fears spoil the fun. As long as adults take reasonable precautions, he says, there's no reason to lock up the ghosts and goblins. Keep their hands clean and make sure they don't share drinking glasses if they go to parties.</p>
<p>If a child is ill, he or she should be kept home. Yes, it will make you unpopular, but there are alternatives. Consider asking other children to trick-or-treat for them, Butler-Jones suggests.</p>
<p>"Finding other ways so that kids can enjoy Halloween even if they're ill without actually having to go out there, I think is one way to address it."</p>
<p>HERE ARE SOME MORE QUESTIONS ANSWERED:</p>
<p>- What should I do if I'm handing out treats?</p>
<p>If you are the one at the door in charge of the candy bowl, hand candy out yourself instead of allowing children to put their hands in the bowl. Make sure all treats are wrapped.</p>
<p>- Should I wear a surgical mask if I'm handing out treats?</p>
<p>Only if your goal is to scare children. Health Canada does not recommend that members of the general public use surgical masks to protect themselves from contracting H1N1. You run the risk of contaminating yourself when putting on and taking off a surgical mask, and actually increase the risk of getting infected. The exception to this is people who are displaying flu-like symptoms. If this is you, you should not be handing out treats at the door.</p>
<p>- What should parents do?</p>
<p>Bring some hand sanitizer with you when you're going from door to door, and remind children to keep their hands away from their eyes, noses and mouths.</p>
<p>- What about Halloween masks?</p>
<p>Even without H1N1, makeup is safer than masks, which can make it hard for children to see. But physicians have pointed out the dangers of trying on masks in a store before Halloween. That includes the surfaces of a mask that are pressed against a child's face.</p>
<p>If you do choose a mask and bring it home, be sure to clean it thoroughly before anyone wears it.</p>
<p>- What about going to Halloween parties?</p>
<p>Stay away if you have flu-like symptoms -- fever and cough are the giveaways, especially combined with body aches, a sore throat, or a runny nose. Public health officials are counting on vigilant parents to help prevent the spread of H1N1. But Health Canada says it is important for healthy people to continue their daily lives during the pandemic, including going to community events. In crowded situations, take extra precautions such as frequent handwashing. Make sure everyone practises cough etiquette --cough into their elbows, not their hands -- and avoid communal bowls.</p>
<p>- Anything else to avoid?</p>
<p>Bobbing for apples is definitely a no-no this year.</p>
<p>- Any final words?</p>
<p>Don't forget to take the usual precautions to keep children safe when they're trick-or-treating, including making sure costumes are visible to motorists and children are supervised while trick-or-treating. Discard any unwrapped candy for safety reasons as well as preventing H1N1 infection.</p>
<p>DO YOU HAVE H1N1 QUESTIONS?</p>
<p>Where are the vaccine lineups? What is the latest on the H1N1 pandemic in B.C.? Starting Monday at 8 a.m., vancouversun.com will host a daily live chat room with the latest news and information from experts and anyone else who wants to participate.</p>

<p>"Facts don't do what I want them to." -- Talking Heads</p>
<p>At a recent press conference, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said that people have a responsibility to "get the facts" about the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Nothing wrong with that, you might think, since people do have a responsibility to protect themselves, and their communities, from preventable diseases. And there's no better way to do so than by getting all the facts.</p>
<p>But there is something wrong with it: Aglukkaq's statement suggests she has been seduced by the belief, popular among public health officials, that simply apprising people of the facts is sufficient to change their behaviours.</p>
<p>To be sure, we can change behaviour by replacing ignorance with knowledge. Recent surveys that found people are taking certain precautions against the H1N1 virus are evidence of that. But those same surveys reveal that resistance to the vaccine isn't necessarily the result of people being unaware of the facts, and hence providing more facts won't necessarily solve the problem.</p>
<p>The one thing we can agree on is that there is a problem. According to a recent Ipsos-Reid survey, respondents were evenly divided on whether they plan to get vaccinated: 51 per cent said they are likely or somewhat likely to get the shot, while 48 per cent are not at all or not very likely to avail themselves of the immunization.</p>
<p>A recent Harvard School of Public Health survey found similar results among Americans, with only 40 per cent of respondents saying they are "absolutely certain" they will get the vaccine, and 41 per cent certain that they will not.</p>
<p>Perhaps most revealing, though, are two Strategic Counsel surveys conducted in July and October. The July survey found 62 per cent of respondents planned to get the shot, with only 38 per cent deciding against it. Fast forward to October, and only 49 per cent of respondents now intend to get vaccinated, while 51 per cent plan to pass.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's a little hard to believe that people have fewer facts now than they did in July. And that suggests that whatever is causing people to oppose vaccination, it isn't a lack of facts.</p>
<p>This becomes clearer if we look at people's reasons for refusing the vaccine. According to the Ipsos-Reid survey, 34 per cent of Canadians aren't certain it is safe and 29 per cent believe they could get sick from the vaccine itself. Similarly, the Harvard survey found that 30 per cent of those opposed to the vaccine fear side effects, while 28 per cent believe H1N1 isn't sufficiently serious to warrant vaccination.</p>
<p>These beliefs may be the result of a lack of the facts, although that's doubtful. For months now, Canadians have heard public health officials attest to the safety of the vaccine, and the potential severity of an H1N1 outbreak, for both individuals and the community.</p>
<p>It seems, then, that people opposed to vaccination aren't unaware of the facts; rather, they simply don't believe them. Or more specifically, they don't believe the people who are providing them with the facts: scientists and public health officials.</p>
<p>This is not entirely surprising, given that we live in an era of distrust of authority, including scientific authority. Development of new technologies, including weapons, genetic and reproductive technologies, led some people to question whether science and scientists ought to be trusted, as did certain highly publicized scientific failures, such as the space shuttle disasters.</p>
<p>Populist politicians have added to this distrust by characterizing anyone with specialized knowledge as elitist, as an enemy of the people. One need look no further than the federal government for evidence of this, as Prime Minister Stephen Harper routinely attacks any science that disagrees with his preordained beliefs, and says the feds are "listening to ordinary people, not people who work in ivory towers."</p>
<p>Given this, Aglukkaq can hardly complain that Canadians resist getting the facts about H1N1 from scientists: You reap what you sow.</p>
<p>Instead, people look to other sources for the "facts." And when it comes to vaccines, there are plenty of other sources. Indeed, the anti-vaccination movement, which has existed since Edward Jenner first demonstrated the effectiveness of the smallpox vaccine in the late 18th century, now provides a wealth of websites attesting to the evils of immunization.</p>
<p>These sites and message boards are typically short on science and statistics, and focus instead on heart-wrenching stories of children who have been irreparably harmed, say the authors, by vaccines.</p>
<p>Scientists and public health officials are no match for this celebration of feelings over facts, stories over stats. Scientists can repeat all the facts they want -- they can tell us that H1N1 has been responsible for at least 88 deaths, 1,500 hospitalizations and 300 critical care admissions in Canada this year -- but that pales in comparison to the story of one child ostensibly devastated by a vaccine. One must never forget Josef Stalin's admonition that a single death is a tragedy, but a million deaths is a statistic.</p>
<p>And statistics -- facts -- as important as they for science, don't necessarily do what we want them to. People aren't always persuaded by bald facts -- they're persuaded by stories. Indeed, it is through stories that we organize our world, that we make sense of all the facts that bombard us each day.</p>
<p>This is something the anti-vax movement recognized long ago, which is why the movement emphasizes heart-wrenching stories. And if scientists and public health officials are ever going to regain the ability to influence behaviour, they must stop the ivory tower approach of simply quoting statistics and telling people to get the facts. They must learn to tell stories.</p>
<p>Medicine is all about stories, about case histories - the stories of people's illnesses and the stories of their lives. Perhaps this is why so many great literary figures, from Anton Chekhov to Arthur Conan Doyle, have been physicians. Certainly, this is why we have seen the rise of "narrative medicine," an approach to resolving clinical ethical problems that emphasizes the power of stories.</p>
<p>And recognition of the power of the narrative should also influence the approach of public health officials. It is, after all, easy -- too easy -- to find stories, now and in the past, of children who died needless and excruciating deaths from preventable diseases simply because they didn't receive a vaccine. These are stories that need to be told, that tell us a lot more about the</p>
<p>real toll of illness -- and could consequently have more influence on public behaviour -- than a million statistics.</p>
<p>This doesn't mean, of course, that the facts are unimportant. And yes, people have a responsibility to get the facts. But equally, public health officials have a responsibility to help people make sense of those facts, to tell stories that provide people with an understanding what those facts mean, and why they matter.</p>

<p>Re: Warning: Vaccine misinformation is contagious, Oct. 27</p>
<p>I found Dr. Catherine D'Amico's article about the H1N1 vaccine accurate, informative and timely.</p>
<p>This morning, on my way to help out at our community flu clinic, I met a gentleman who was lined up early for his H1N1 vaccination. He said, "I can't believe the number of my friends who take in all sorts of media and decide among themselves not to get immunized. They just don't have the right information."</p>
<p>I agree. I realize that people will make their own decisions for or against immunization and each person has a right to his or her own opinion, but is it an informed decision based on accurate information?</p>
<p>People don't seem to understand that H1N1 influenza is serious. According to the World Health Organization, H1N1 had killed more than 5,000 people worldwide as of Oct. 17.</p>
<p>Some of the best websites to go to for accurate information are those of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, the Public Health Agency of Canada, the World Health Organization and the Health on the Net Foundation (a non-governmental organization that sets standards to protect citizens from misleading health information).</p>

</p>
<p>The giant lineups and frustration that dominated the first week of the biggest immunization program in history is expected to get worse next week, as health officials concede that public demand is exceeding the number of doses and the staff available to administer the vaccine.</p>
<p>Provinces reported clinic shutdowns Friday and federal officials painted a gloomy outlook for the week ahead because they have received only one-fifth the amount of vaccine that they had expected to distribute nationwide.</p>
<p>The manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, has fallen behind because it is making a special vaccine for pregnant women, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones told a news conference.</p>
<p>Word of the production slowdown came as the World Health Organization reversed its earlier position and said Friday there is now no reason for pregnant women to favour the special version being made exclusively for them.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has switched its one production line back to making the regular vaccine, but it will take some time to ramp up to the target of producing three million doses per week.</p>
<p>Butler Jones said that officials learned Thursday they will have only 400,000 new doses to ship out next week and another 225,000 doses reserved for pregnant women -- far short of the six million that have been distributed thus far.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones, who had maintained until the last few days that there would be plenty of vaccine for everyone, cautioned that the H1N1 campaign is being delivered in "real time" so there are many unprecedented challenges that were not anticipated.</p>
<p>"We're producing it, testing it, distributing it, giving it to people all at the same time," he said.</p>
<p>"It is something that nobody has ever actually had to deal with before in this kind of context. It's the largest immunization campaign in history."</p>
<p>The goal, he said, is to have Canadians who want the H1N1 shot immunized by Christmas.</p>
<p>His appeal for patience was little comfort in many quarters, where Canadians were turned away by the hundreds as clinics ran out of time and supply on Friday.</p>
<p>As H1N1 clinics extend their hours or shut their doors early, complaints persisted about the distribution system, which has been confined to only a small number of large venues rather than smaller outlets such as doctors' offices.</p>
<p>In Calgary, all five clinics were suspended and some closed as early as 9:45 a.m. as people had started lining up at 3 a.m. The situation was much the same in Edmonton.</p>
<p>A fight between the U.S. government and swine flu vaccine makers reached the highest level on Friday, with President Barack Obama expressing frustration at the slow pace of production.</p>
<p>Federal officials slashed their initial estimates of how much H1N1 vaccine would be available -- from 40 million doses by the end of October to 26 million doses available as of Friday.</p>
<p>Vaccine makers say it has been harder than anticipated to make the vaccine using the current 50-year-old technology based on chicken eggs. t</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Frustration, bitterness, anger are all symptoms of 'flu rage'</b>
</div><div>Misty Harris   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>527 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>As much as flu fears have people pulling away, H1N1 is also uniting Canadians through emotion -- specifically, a deeply entrenched sense of frustration that, for many, has mutated into bitterness, anger and even hostility.</p>
<p>Call it flu rage. Across the country, otherwise mild-mannered Canadians are finding themselves admonishing strangers for open sneezing, losing their cool with queue-jumpers at vaccination clinics, writing angry letters to government and media, and lashing out at friends whose H1N1 opinions differ from their own.</p>
<p>"Anger can cause us to be proactive . . . but it can also become destructive, which is what we see with flu rage," says psychologist Gordon Asmundson, a professor whose research at the University of Regina includes health anxiety.</p>
<p>"It's about a sense of uncertainty combined with the feeling of having no control over a situation. We tend to catastrophize when we're anxious."</p>
<p>Tami Xanthakis, a proofreader from Montreal, can't remember the last time she was this worked up about something as "elementary" as a flu shot.</p>
<p>"What's fuelled my anger is feeling like I'm between a rock and a hard place, not knowing what to do," says Xanthakis. "I feel like the government is pushing us to do this -- like, 'Just be quiet and take it.' But I don't know enough to feel secure with the vaccine."</p>
<p>For others, such as Barbara Carlson of Dawson Creek, B.C., it's media "hysteria" and Internet half-truths that make her bristle.</p>
<p>"This is the year 2009, and yet, people still believe in superstition and misinformation," says Carlson, a retiree. "Do you know how many e-mails I've gotten that told me I could prevent H1N1 by cutting up raw onions and putting them in water around my house? I finally replied, 'Hanging a dead rat around your neck will do just as much good.' The (sender) was quite miffed."</p>
<p>Dan Hoch, principal of an elementary school just outside Calgary, says emotions are running high among parents and teachers alike, primarily because of what he calls the "mind-boggling" deficit in vaccination sites.</p>
<p>"This is a life-and-death scenario . . . People are asking, 'How did the province not get it right?'" says Hoch. "What would it have taken to ask each school to give up their gymnasium for a day and vaccinate all the kids there -- literally run them through the same way we do on picture day? It could easily have been done."</p>
<p>Resentment also looms large among Canadians that find themselves constantly worrying about infection, whether from open-sneezers at the gym or those who blithely bypass the sinks in public washrooms.</p>
<p>"I think about it all the time -- more than ever before," admits J'Lyn Nye, a radio host from Edmonton who says she doesn't want to be "sheeple" by herding in for a vaccine she knows little about.</p>
<p>"I come in first thing every morning and wipe down all the studio equipment with Lysol. I love the guys I work with, but you never know where their hands have been."</p>

</p>
<p>Before the fall of 2009, I was a pretty good mother with pretty good instincts. I knew when to take my child to the doctor and when to ride it out, when to send a sore throat to bed and when to take it in for a strep culture.</p>
<p>Then came the Great Swine Flu, and the ticking time bomb of deadly H1N1 microbes, gathering up supercharged energy to coat every pencil, every desk, every shared water bottle and the crook of every fourth-grade elbow that has ever risen to be coughed upon.</p>
<p>Somewhere in there, somewhere between my 12-year-old son's hacking cough and fever -- which may or may not have constituted H1N1 -- and a neighbour child's swine flu ankles hurting so bad she couldn't walk, I became paralysed with fear. Somewhere between trying to remain rational and want-ing to race my family to a bomb shelter every time I saw somebody sneeze, I lost my way as the calm voice of wisdom for my family. Somewhere between Moms-againstmercury.org's "Don't inoculate!" and the U.S. Center for Disease Control's "Do inoculate!" I became a bad mother.</p>
<p>Never mind instincts. The only body part not immobilized by confusion were my hands, flitting across the keyboard as I sought answers to the unanswerable: Should I risk mercury poisoning from the evil, conspiring, capitalistic government-sanctioned vaccination? Or do I risk being labelled an abusive parent by not inoculating my children against the dreaded illness? Should I send runny noses to school, that grubby North American institution where swine flu is germinating faster than teenaged love? Or do I keep moderately sick kids home longer than usual, only to face backed-up homework and stronger H1N1 when they return? Should I believe that even the slightest temperature/cough is H1N1? Or do I assume my kids have H1N1 only if their ankles hurt?</p>
<p>Even my go-to health-care provider was overwhelmed, telling me instead of crowding her office or the emergency room with my son's potential H1N1, "Just assume his flu symptoms are swine flu and please go home and act accordingly."</p>
<p>The mother of the girl with the aching ankles said her pediatrician wouldn't go near her child to test or treat her: The doc has an infant and an immune-compromised four-year-old at home and didn't want to risk infection herself.</p>
<p>Just assume. Act accordingly. Please go home.</p>
<p>Then what?</p>
<p>What is a mother to do when her doctor says she's going to get the shot, but her pharmacist says she isn't, when her trusted mommy friends are sending coughing kids to school in the mommy van carpool and she can actually see the spittle flying through the air and landing on her steering wheel?</p>
<p>My 17-year-old daughter, who had her own not-sure-it's-swine-flu a couple of weeks ago, turned her little face to me the other day and said: "Why can't they just tell us what's going on?"</p>
<p>Because nobody knows.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight million <span class="companylink">Google</span> hits for swine flu and nobody can say with certainty how to differentiate between swine and any other flu, nor whether this vaccination is going to destroy my child's neurological system like the vaccination of 1976 or just gently keep him from getting sick. Nobody knows whether the swine flu of November is going to be worse than the October swine flu.</p>
<p>The best advice came not from the government but from my friend Jacque, who is a mother of five. "Sometimes, when you're a parent, you just have to close your eyes and pick."</p>

</p>
<p>And you thought there was no football in this city, just because it doesn't have a Canadian Football League franchise.</p>
<p>Well, welcome to Championship Weekend.</p>
<p>Clear your agenda for today and Sunday as you can watch football at its best at all levels ... including a game at Lansdowne Park's Frank Clair Stadium, which doesn't feature a couple of CFL teams.</p>
<p>The gridiron excitement was scheduled to start Friday night, when the National Capital Amateur Football Association staged its midget championship at the Nepean Sportsplex's Minto Sports Field.</p>
<p>Pennant winning Canterbury Mustangs, 7-1, were scheduled to meet Mews Orléans Dukes, 5-3, for the title. They split their two-game regular-season series, but the Dukes won the second game 20-14 two weeks ago to close out the regular season.</p>
<p>Canterbury had many league leaders entering the midget final, including running back Henry Cassius, top rusher, 29 carries for 257 yards and one touchdown; and Justin Warden, top defensive player, who had 33 tackles and six sacks.</p>
<p>The eighth-ranked University of Ottawa Gee-Gees are slated to open their Ontario University Athletics playoff season today with a quarter-final against McMaster University Marauders at 1 p.m. at Frank Clair Stadium.</p>
<p>Quarterback Brad Sinopoli was the backbone of the Gee-Gees 6-2 regular-season.</p>
<p>He was No. 3 in OUA passing, completing 144 of 249 passes for 2,084 yards, adding 11 touchdowns and only had six interceptions. But he was sacked 15 times, the fourth most in the league. Sinopoli also was the Gee-Gees second-best rusher with 53 trips for 624 yards and seven touchdowns to be sixth in the OUA.</p>
<p>Jordan Wilson-Ross was the No. 2 OUA rusher with 790 yards on 111 carries and six touchdowns.</p>
<p>Sinopoli's passing also made Steven Hughes and Cyril Adjelty the second- and third-ranked receivers in the OUA respectively. Hughes caught 41 passes for 685 yards and two touchdowns, while Adjelty picked up 672 yards on 37 receptions and added seven touchdowns.</p>
<p>Matthew Falvo was the Gee-Gees top scorer with 80 points, including an OUA-best 17 field goals.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Sooners, celebrating their 50th year of junior football, will be at Carleton University's Keith Harris Stadium on Sunday to play Edmonton Wildcats in the Intergold Cup final. The Canadian Junior Football League semifinal goes at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>The Sooners returned to the Ontario Football Conference this season after a 14-year absence and are one win away from returning to the Canadian Bowl Nov. 14 against the British Columbia Football Conference champion. They have won the national titles in 1974, 1979, 1984 and 1992.</p>
<p>The National Capital Amateur Football Association's four division A age-group finals are Sunday at the Nepean Sportsplex's Minto Sports Field. The West Conference leads the way with six entries, while the East Conference had two.</p>
<p>Kanata Knights and Nepean Redskins will be represented in two finals apiece, which covers all four finals -- tyke, mosquito, peewee and bantam.</p>
<p>Kanata, 8-0, will meet Mews Orléans Bengals, 6-1-1, in the bantam final. The Knights, 7-1, go against Gatineau Vikings, 7-1, as a pair of West Conference teams meet in the peewee final.</p>
<p>Nepean and North Gloucester Giants will clash in the tyke final, which is a matchup of 8-0 squads. The mosquito final will have the Redskins, 7-1, battling Bell Warriors, 6-2.</p>
<p>The game times are tyke at 9 a.m., mosquito at 11 a.m., peewee at 1:10 p.m. and bantam at 3:20 p.m.</p>
<p>Winners' circle: Earl of March Secondary School student Ilya Abelev placed second in the men's 65-kilogram class at the Concordia University invitational wrestling meet, losing to Montreal's James Mancini, a two-time Canadian senior medallist. ... University of Maine's Anjelica Hodgson of Nepean has been named to the America East women's first all-star soccer team. A second team all-star in 2007, Hodgson started all 15 games and was a key player on the Black Bears' defence, which allowed only 16 goals and had seven shutouts. ... Robin Clarke of Kanata is the third seed for the GoodLife men's professional squash open tournament running Thursday through Sunday, Nov. 8 at GoodLife Fitness, 2655 Queensview Drive. Ottawa's Adrian Dudzicki made the 16-man draw as a wild card. ... Ontario champion Ottawa Devils reached the women's AA semifinals at the Tournament of Champions Canadian touch football championships in Unionville. They lost to eventual winners Montreal Fleur de Lys by a single point. Ottawa Capitals reached the men's AA quarter-finals. ... The 2010 AthletesCAN Forum and KidsCAN School Day will be staged in Gatineau Oct. 28-31. ... Kristopher Twardek, who played for Ottawa South United at soccer tournaments in Denmark and Sweden and attended a session at the Everton Soccer Academy in England this summer, didn't get to travel to Brazil for the 10th <span class="companylink">Danone</span> Nations Cup soccer tournament for boys and girls' aged 11 and 12 as it was cancelled this month because of the H1N1 pandemic. ... Ashbury College grads Maggie Cogger-Orr of McMaster University and Laurie Biewald of the University of Western Ontario were named the Ontario University Athletics women's rugby rookies of the year in the Russell and Shiels divisions respectively. Cogger-Orr, who plays the hooker position, and Biewald, a fly half, also were named to the all-star teams along with Ottawa's Karlye Wong, a Queen's University centre, and Ottawa's Jocelyn Poirier, a Queen's flanker, in the Russell Division. ... York University's fifth-year goalkeeper Brittany Blount of Ottawa was selected to the OUA women's field hockey first all-star team for the second time. ... Hector Carranco has been returned as commodore for a second term in a row and summer-winter Olympian Sue Holloway was elected vice-commodore at the Rideau Canoe Club's annual general meeting. ... University of British Columbia Thunderbirds women's basketball coach Debbie Huband has been voted into the UBC women's touch football hall of fame. She also is in the Ottawa, UBC basketball and Canada's basketball hall of fames and is on the Nepean Wall of Fame.</p>

<p>Re: " 'Get out of our schools,' military recruiters told" (Gazette, Oct. 29).</p>
<p>It is the sign of the times that a coalition of unions and students in Montreal have collectively told the military recruiters to "get out." It is really humiliating! Montrealers in particular and Canadians in general are really getting fed up.</p>
<p>Even after eight years of military action in Afghanistan, nothing substantial has been achieved and many of us are not even aware why are we involved in NATO action, in far-off Afghanistan.</p>
<p>We need our soldiers here in Canada to help in rescue work and controlling the H1N1 pandemic.</p>

<p>Standing in the rain outside the Salvation Army building on George Street, Lawrence Mailman gives his opinion of the H1N1 influenza vaccine.</p>
<p>"If you wanna get sick, take the flu shot," says Mailman. "I've got an immune system like you wouldn't believe. It's champion. I don't take pills. I drink wine. I smoke weed."</p>
<p>Sipping beer from a coffee mug, Al Neil agrees.</p>
<p>"I took a vaccine for the flu in Vancouver. Holy s--t, did I get sick," Neil says.</p>
<p>Asked whether he's worried about dying from H1N1, which recently claimed the lives of two young people in Ontario, Neil is philosophical:</p>
<p>"Alcohol has killed 3,000 people," he says. "I'll probably die of it first."</p>
<p>Ottawa Inner-City Health, a non-profit organization associated with the city's hospitals, universities and shelters and the public health unit, is planning to run H1N1 vaccination clinics at homeless shelters and drop-in centres through November.</p>
<p>Wendy Muckle, the corporation's executive director, said she's heard the bravado about refusing the flu shot before; but in fact, the patrons of homeless shelters have a good record of getting immunized.</p>
<p>"They'll take it. They will. They say that every year about the flu shot," she said. "But they roll up their sleeves and take it. ... They have a good rapport with the nurses."</p>
<p>Muckle said the first vaccination clinic for people living on the streets was Wednesday at The Well, a daytime drop-in centre for women. Another is scheduled for Nov. 16 at the Shepherds of Good Hope, said Jonathan Allsop, the Shepherds' co-ordinator of public relations.</p>
<p>The other planned clinics are not being advertised yet, Muckle said, because the supply of vaccine is still uncertain. There will also be efforts by nurses to approach some homeless people individually.</p>
<p>"Some of the people who are mentally ill are not willing to go to the clinics, but they will take the vaccine if it is offered to them."</p>
<p>Muckle said homeless people are vulnerable to infection by the flu virus because many of them have underlying medical conditions such as lung problems, diabetes, HIV and hepatitis. Homeless people who show flu symptoms are being directed to the Mission clinic to be screened, and may be housed in an isolation bed at the Salvation Army facility on George Street, if needed. She said a man is currently in isolation at the Salvation Army.</p>
<p>Allsop said holding a clinic on-site is a better way to reach the clientele at the Shepherds of Good Hope, rather than expecting them to travel to clinics at a different location in the city and perhaps wait in line for hours. "I've worked in case-work before. You send them somewhere, and they get lost along the way," he said. "This is the way to do it."</p>
<p>And though some of the men who frequent the downtown shelters appear to have no interest in the vaccine, others say they may take advantage of the chance to get it.</p>
<p>"The more I'm looking at it these days, I say yes. Especially when that 11-year-old girl died," said Peter McCourt, standing outside the Salvation Army, referring to a pre-teen girl from Cornwall who died of H1N1 flu over the weekend at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario.</p>
<p>"I'm gonna wait a week or two and see if there's any reaction from the vaccine."</p>

<p>The Upper Canada District School Board is suspending dances, school clubs and activities such as Girl Guide meetings and craft fairs until mid-November. Even professional development days may be affected. David Thomas, the board's director of education, said H1N1 and seasonal flu mean staff need to focus on cleanliness, absentee calls and keeping in contact with parents and the community. Sports and programs held during school hours will continue. The board covers rural areas south of Ottawa to the St. Lawrence River, east to Quebec and west to Gananoque.</p>

</p>
<p>How much do we have?</p>
<p>Ottawa has received 83,500 doses of H1N1 vaccine, according to the public health department, and is expecting another shipment of 49,500 doses by today. The federal government ordered millions of doses on behalf of the provinces; the provincial governments take delivery and then ship the vaccine to regional health units according to which areas need it most.</p>
<p>How much have we given out?</p>
<p>Approximately 35,000 doses in the city's vaccination clinics, according to the health department's Friday estimates, and a further 14,000 doses in hospitals.</p>
<p>How long will our current supply last?</p>
<p>Till about next weekend, says the health department.</p>
<p>When are we getting more?</p>
<p>There isn't another scheduled delivery for Ottawa, but the federal and provincial authorities have been making shipments as supplies become available. A week's supply is the most Ottawa's authorities have had in hand since vaccinations began last week, but all provinces have been told to expect the flow to diminish sharply this week.</p>
<p>Why's that?</p>
<p>The Canadian factory run by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> and contracted to make the vaccine switched its production over to a slightly different form of the vaccine thought to be more suitable for pregnant women, one without an "adjuvant" booster ingredient. After making 1.8 million doses of that, the factory (near Quebec City) has switched back again, but the conversions created a big dip in supply that's working its way through the system.</p>
<p>How big a dip?</p>
<p>According to Health Canada, 2.1 million doses were sent out across the country this past week. Next week, the forecast is only 660,900 doses, including both adjuvanted and non-adjuvanted versions. Ontario's share is to go from 785,000 doses to 256,800.</p>
<p>Is the non-adjuvanted version better for pregnant women?</p>
<p>Early Friday, the World Health Organization issued a report saying there's no reason for them to favour the non-adjuvanted vaccine, but by that time the <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> factory had already made the switch. Ottawa Public Health says pregnant women can choose which version they want when both are available. So far, only the adjuvanted version has arrived in Ottawa.</p>
<p>What does the drop in supply mean in Ottawa?</p>
<p>We have enough to keep distributing it at current rates, but don't expect to see more clinics opening or much vaccine distributed to family doctors to give. Before vaccinations started, Ottawa Public Health said it would take a week or two to start giving shots to people outside the priority groups of very young children, pregnant women and people with chronic medical conditions; that likely can't happen before the supply is renewed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>$49M health budget passes without protest as councillors applaud Levy</b>
</div><div>Patrick Dare   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>521 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy came to City Hall to defend his public-health department budget on Thursday, but he didn't have to say a word.</p>
<p>The $49-million budget passed council's community and protective services committee in about five seconds, with not a single question asked. Instead, Diane Holmes led councillors in a round of applause for Ottawa's medical officer of health and his work managing the swine-flu vaccination program.</p>
<p>Such is the support city councillors are giving Levy and his 475-employee public-health department. Councillors concede there have been problems, but they say many are tied to the rules set out by the provincial government for where and how the shots are to be given out.</p>
<p>Committee chairwoman and councillor Diane Deans said there were some "adjustments" needed in the first days of the swine-flu vaccinations but she's encouraged that the city went from 4,000 vaccinations a day on Monday to 8,100 a day by Friday.</p>
<p>"I'm pretty pleased with Week 1. We got out of the gate sooner than most municipalities across the province, so I think we're off to a good start," said Deans. Toronto, for instance, only started vaccinating vulnerable members of the public on Thursday and was at least as swamped by demand as Ottawa.</p>
<p>She said strict reporting and vaccine-control rules set out by the province have hobbled the health department. While the city would like to locate clinics in schools, Deans said the computer requirements for reporting alone make it difficult to set up temporarily there.</p>
<p>The chairwoman said she knows many people were upset by the long lineups, but others also expressed thanks to the city officials who are running the clinics.</p>
<p>Innes Councillor Rainer Bloess said councillors received complaints and were concerned after the first day, but the changes that were made and the increased volume of inoculations have shown that the program is improving. He also said Levy has done a good job of keeping councillors informed about what is being done and why.</p>
<p>"We've seen steady improvement from Day 1," said Bloess. "I think we're doing an excellent job compared with other jurisdictions."</p>
<p>Kanata South Councillor Peggy Feltmate ended up at the Kanata Recreation Complex Friday morning to follow up on complaints. She said the clinics haven't worked all that smoothly, but she, too, blames the provincial rules and lengthy documentation process that can take up to 15 minutes per patient.</p>
<p>"Staff have done a tremendous job," said Barrhaven Councillor Jan Harder, adding that many citizens are frightened and angry over swine flu and the long delays at clinics. She noted noted that intense media coverage is "ratcheting up" anxiety levels to the boiling point.</p>
<p>Some of the city communications have not been entirely clear, Harder says, and the lack of clinics in schools led to bottlenecks.</p>
<p>Deans said one of her major concerns about the vaccination program -- which is expected to last 12 weeks -- is burnout of city staff.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Week 1 ends in mixed reviews; Relief, frustration, optimism cited by patients, officials</b>
</div><div>Tom Spears   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>After a week of flu shots, Ottawa is a city of two tales.</p>
<p>At city offices, the vaccination campaign looks good. Vaccination numbers are climbing, staff are learning how to hand out numbered wristbands efficiently, and the supply of vaccine looks secure for now.</p>
<p>In the inevitable lineups, you'll hear a mix of moods. There's profound gratitude and relief at getting protection from a potentially deadly virus, but constant frustration at the slowness, the mixups, the difficulty in getting information.</p>
<p>Nothing shows the two solitudes quite like the language people use.</p>
<p>Here's Dr. Vera Etches, one of Ottawa's associate medical officers of health, who has been at clinics all week and done her share of the actual injections: "What I find is there has been a bit of a line-up," she says mildly.</p>
<p>And here's Debbie Rofner. She was three places from the front of the line at the Kanata Recreation Complex Friday, after a three-hour wait, when they announced the rest of the day was full:</p>
<p>"They told us to go home, that we're basically in the way. Some people have newborn children here. If they don't have time to take me today, that's fine. Just tell me when to come on Monday with my toddler."</p>
<p>But instead she has to leave and start from scratch another day, along with about 100 people who were in line behind her when the cutoff came.</p>
<p>While rumours of what the city might or might not do with the crowds ripple up and down the lines, the city's briefings are dominated by data.</p>
<p>"What we continue to see is an increase in the number of cases of H1N1 in our community," Etches told reporters Friday afternoon. "Most cases are mild," but of 195 lab-confirmed cases, 39 people have been hospitalized and there has been one death.</p>
<p>Of 348 local schools, 86 have an absentee rate greater than 10 per cent, a number that has risen sharply since last week.</p>
<p>"Our vaccine clinic performance has steadily improved," rising from 4,200 shots Monday to 8,550 Thursday, she said.</p>
<p>And while clinics are still the only way for most people to get a shot, the city has "invited" family doctors to offer vaccinations too. It's expecting larger practices to accept, as they tend to have more staff to handle the rigorous reporting requirements.</p>
<p>The city has distributed 14,000 doses to hospitals and chronic-care facilities.</p>
<p>Vaccine supplies are adequate for now, Etches said: the province has promised 49,500 further doses by today.</p>
<p>This week's experience has shown that flu clinics follow a basic principle in engineering -- you can only put a certain amount of water through a half-inch pipe, no matter how hard you push it and no matter how badly you want more.</p>
<p>All week, Ottawa has been trying to push more residents through the flu clinics, at a faster rate.</p>
<p>For the water problem, the answer is to get more pipes, or one bigger pipe.</p>
<p>But Dr. Isra Levy, the head of Ottawa's public-health unit and Etches' boss, said this week he's already using all the nurses the department can find. By Tuesday (Day 2 of the campaign), the department was bringing in paramedics -- 10 or 12 at each of the bigger clinics -- to augment the 15 or so nurses.</p>
<p>There has to be a staff rotation, clinics are running seven days a week and staff need some days off. The result, Etches said, is that the city had 60 people giving shots Monday, rising to 100 per day by the week's end.</p>
<p>All week, public health officials have been adjusting procedures, trying to get maximum efficiency from the system.</p>
<p>One step has been to unload some of the registration work from the nurses giving shots. On Monday, they were all entering data about who was getting shots on laptops, which was time-consuming. Now, more of the record-keeping is done at a registration desk. Information and clerical staff have been beefed up, too.</p>
<p>Still, some consultation has to go on at the shot-giving stage. "Vaccination is a medical procedure, and a certain amount of discussion with medical personnel is required," Etches said.</p>
<p>There's probably no way to escape this, said Mary-Anne Andrusyszyn, director of the school of nursing at the University of Western Ontario. This year's flu vaccine is significantly different from the types many people have had each year, and the nurse or paramedic needs to ask some questions and explain what a bad reaction might look like.</p>
<p>It didn't take clinics long to realize that giving people in line numbers and letting them go home for a couple of hours was of benefit to everyone. It means people don't have to stand in line to keep their places like patients in a Third World refugee camp.</p>
<p>Besides, crowding together in cramped hallways during a pandemic makes people nervous, especially when someone coughs.</p>
<p>Starting today, all the clinics are supposed to adopt the same system of giving out numbered wristbands early. But for days this week, residents at the east-side and Centrepointe clinics had to line up for hours just to get a number.</p>
<p>Many were turned away once. Yvette Besner and her daughter, Leia, who is nearly three, were turned away twice at Fred Barrett Arena on Leitrim Road -- Wednesday and again Thursday.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping it (the wait) will die down as time goes on," Besner said. "But next week they open it up to everybody."</p>
<p>She was wrong about that, as it turned out. The coming week will again be reserved for the same high-priority groups -- pregnant women, very young children, people with chronic medical conditions, and direct caregivers for high-risk people who can't get the shot. And the clinics will still depend on the honour system, though people who appear not to be in a high-priority group are being questioned and politely asked to leave if they don't belong.</p>
<p>Many clinics are set up (at least on weekdays) for an afternoon-evening shift. In theory this allows people to go after work. But in practice, anyone arriving in the late afternoon or evening is out of luck.</p>
<p>The Clinic Most Likely to Fill Up Fast is easily Fred Barrett Arena. It can serve only 350 people a day, less than half as many as the bigger clinics in Orléans, Kanata, and so on. Around lunchtime -- a couple of hours before it even opens -- there's always a sign posted announcing that all spots for the day are full.</p>
<p>This weekend will be a whole new operation, with earlier hours; Etches said Friday the city is expecting about the same numbers of people as on weekdays, but no one knows for sure.</p>
<p>There's one new rule: Clinics open at 9 a.m., and numbered wristbands will be handed out starting at 7:30. People at the front of the line will be told to stick around; those farther back will be given a time when they should return.</p>

<p>In some editions of yesterday's paper, a story about the H1N1 flu virus incorrectly said that the antiviral drug Tamiflu is not considered effective against H1N1. Two prescription drugs are available when flu symptoms are serious, oseltamivir (Tamiflu) and zanamivir (Relenza). The Gazette regrets the error.</p>

</p>
<p>The timing was far from perfect for Premier Dalton McGuinty's announcement this week that full-day kindergarten would begin next fall in some Ontario schools.</p>
<p>With parents and teachers jittery about the H1N1 flu pandemic and taxpayers nervous about Ontario's ballooning deficit, the announcement did not get the full attention it should have. It did, however, get criticized by those who see it as overly ambitious and too expensive at a time when the province is facing tough financial choices, and a $25-billion deficit.</p>
<p>At $1.5 billion a year, the plan to expand junior and senior kindergarten classes across the province from the current half days to full days, is expensive. Possibly more expensive than it needed to be. But, that aside, the early-learning plan is a worthwhile and necessary investment in the province's future. McGuinty should be commended for forging ahead with the initiative, not in spite of the economic times, but because of them. It is the kind of infrastructure spending -- in human infrastructure -- that all governments should be doing.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the year, the federal and provincial governments have invested many billions of dollars to lessen the effect of the global economic meltdown by stimulating the economy. Much of that stimulus spending, while useful to get the economy moving, will have only short-term economic benefits. The highly popular federal home renovation tax credit, for example, has encouraged people to spend money to hire contractors, carpenters, electricians and plumbers. They are also spending on raw materials for renovation projects and furniture to put in that newly renovated space. All of that helps create jobs and get the economy moving. But there is no long-term economic advantage to a rush of spending on new bathrooms and decks.</p>
<p>Other infrastructure projects will have longer-term benefits, especially money that is invested in mass transit or other green transportation measures.</p>
<p>Likewise, the spending on early learning will help give students a level playing field when they begin school, which means more children will succeed at school and better contribute to the economy. It also means fewer of those students will come into conflict with the justice system and rack up other social costs.</p>
<p>"In a highly competitive, global knowledge-based economy, it's absolutely essential that we invest in the younger generation to ensure that we build a powerful work force that can compete and win against the best anywhere on this planet," McGuinty said.</p>
<p>In addition to full-day kindergarten, the early-learning plan includes user-pay before- and after-school care -- a crucial link in the province's patchy child-care system.</p>
<p>The initiatives were recommended by Charles Pascal, the province's early-learning adviser, in an extensive report released in June. His recommendation that early childhood educators be in charge for part of the day in kindergarten proved controversial among elementary teachers. McGuinty seems to have bent to their concerns by announcing a program in which both teachers and early childhood educators will be in kindergarten classrooms all day -- a move that may have made the program more expensive than it needed to be.</p>
<p>Still, the investment in full-day kindergarten is one that will pay off for many years to come.</p>

<p>Re: Highly organized staff, Oct. 29.</p>
<p>My husband and I will try again today and hope that maybe those in charge will have worked out whatever glitches there were in the system to avoid the complete chaos that was seen earlier this week at the Kanata Recreation Centre.</p>
<p>After reading Andrea Guzzo Lehman's letter about her experience on Tuesday at the H1N1 vaccine clinic in Kanata, I was left wondering what went wrong on Wednesday at the same clinic. My family secured a number (No. 519) at 4 pm and were told that 100 to 150 vaccinations were being done each hour. We thought that if we returned around 7 p.m., that might put us close to our time.</p>
<p>We dressed our five-year old girl and three-year-old triplets, two girls and a boy, in their pyjamas, only to arrive and find out that at 7 p.m., workers were seeing No. 90. In three hours, only 140 numbers had been seen.</p>
<p>The scene at the Kanata Recreation Centre was one of pandemonium. No one seemingly from public health to answer questions, one poor security guard bombarded by anxious people, frayed tempers, adults screaming, children crying and when you did find someone to ask, mixed messages all around about whether your number would be honoured, whether the clinic would stay open past 8:30 or if we'd be seen at all.</p>
<p>With 400 numbers ahead of us, we figured we'd be seen about midnight, that is if the clinic stayed open and no one knew one way or the other.</p>

<p>Re: Let family MDs help, Oct. 30.</p>
<p>Letter-writer Julie La Salle thinks offices of family doctors should be administering the H1N1 flu vaccine because her doctor's office backed up with a good staff could vaccinate about 40 patients an hour. I'm curious, as to who did that math.</p>
<p>My family doctor is already overloaded. He cares for hundreds of patients with various concerns and degrees of illnesses. He and his staff are not machines nor mere conveniences for some.</p>
<p>If my doctor chooses not to administer the vaccine, so be it. He knows what's best for his patients. He knows his limits and those of his staff.</p>
<p>As for me, if I choose to get the vaccine, I'll do the same as others who are less fortunate than me to have a family doctor -- I'll get in line.</p>

<p>Re: Wait your turn, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>The Citizen editorial states that "All Ottawans have a duty to get vaccinated against pandemic H1N1 flu." But it seems we are being stopped from doing so by the inept methods being used by Ottawa Public Health department.</p>
<p>At least, some of the Ottawa clinics have switched to issuing numbered tickets to people but at some, they have to stay in the long lineups at the clinic locations. Others getting tickets can return at their times. And others are getting wristbands.</p>
<p>Although public health officials promised to have "a clarified and streamlined process" by Saturday, they would surprise us if they can achieve this objective.</p>
<p>In Sault Ste. Marie, the public health officials allowed the public to telephone their offices and book an appointment time and day for their vaccinations.</p>
<p>I agree with letter-writer Dr. Sahira Charania ("Let family doctors, walk-in clinics administer H1N1 flu shots, too," Oct. 28). Many of us in the priority groups with chronic medical conditions could have gone to our family doctor's offices, instead of these clinics. Perhaps, the authorities have not obtained sufficient dosages.</p>
<p>At age 81, I do not intend to line up for hours in this weather and be exposed to the dangers of contacting what I am hoping to avoid.</p>

<p>Only half of the people in the United States who most need immediate treatment for H1N1 swine flu are actually seeking it, even as the virus spreads at unprecedented speed, U.S. health officials said Friday. "One of the things that we have been surprised to see is even among people who have underlying conditions such as asthma, heart disease or lung disease, only half sought care," director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Thomas Frieden, told reporters in a briefing. At the same time, emergency departments were crowded but often with people who did not need medical care, he said.</p>

<p>One dose of the swine flu vaccine is sufficient to induce an immune response in people aged six months and older, and pregnant women can safely be immunized with either of the licensed swine flu vaccines, the World Health Organization said Friday.</p>
<p>The highest-level advisory body to WHO on immunization and vaccination policy, an advisory group comprised of experts from around the world, has reviewed the results of clinical trials involving several thousand people and more than several hundred thousand who have been vaccinated in "real field" operations organized by 14 countries.</p>
<p>"All the reports received today following vaccination either in clinical trial or live vaccination campaign have showed the safety profile of these pandemic vaccines is good and is very similar to the ones which are known for seasonal influenza," Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director of WHO's Initiative for Vaccine Research told reporters during a briefing Friday from Geneva.</p>
<p>"Nothing special in terms of adverse events has been noted."</p>
<p>Given the significantly higher risk of severe complications in pregnant women who get infected with H1N1, "these women can be vaccinated with any of the currently licensed vaccines," she said.</p>
<p>The world body said a review of the current epidemiological situation of pandemic flu worldwide shows that teens and young adults continue to account for the majority of infections. Hospitalization rates are highest in the very young.</p>
<p>Between one per cent and 10 per cent of patients who get sick with H1N1 need to be hospitalized, and, of those who are hospitalized, 10 to 25 per cent need to be admitted to an intensive care unit; from two to nine per cent admitted to an ICU will die, WHO says.</p>

<p>Fear of adverse events will discourage some people from participating in mass vaccination efforts, but public health experts wrote in the Lancet medical journal Friday they could fight back with statistics. People have special fears about Guillain Barre Syndrome, a rare neurological condition that was linked to a 1976 U.S. swine flu vaccination. At any given time in the U.S. one or two cases of GBS will be seen among any 1 million people in a given month, so if 100 million are vaccinated, during the six weeks following 200 or more cases of GBS will be seen, completely independent of vaccination they said.</p>

<p>Ukraine closed schools and banned public meetings including election rallies and restricted travel on Friday for a three-week period after confirming its first death from H1N1 flu. Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko announced the measures, saying the virus had reached epidemic levels in three parts of western Ukraine. The epidemic coincides with the start of campaigning for a presidential election on Jan. 17. President Viktor Yushchenko said Ukraine, already suffering the effects of a severe economic downturn, would turn to international institutions and partners for help if necessary.</p>

<p>Edmonton police officers are not on a priority list to get the H1N1 vaccine, a fact that concerns the city's police commission and union head.</p>
<p>"We don't want to appear to be selfish, but we don't have a choice," said Edmonton Police Association president Tony Simioni. "We are front-line and because of the lack of options available to us in dealing and handling people, we should be on a priority list along with other emergency services."</p>
<p>Officers can get the seasonal flu shot at their workplace, but must stand in line with everyone else if they want the H1N1 vaccination. Simioni said he has heard concerns from those officers who interact daily with high-risk populations.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Police Commission has also sent a letter to Health Minister Ron Liepert and Solicitor General Fred Lindsay, expressing concern that officers are not on a priority list.</p>
<p>Although Calgary's emergency services have reported a big rise in absentee rates, Edmonton police and fire officials say they haven't seen a spike in the number of staff off work.</p>
<p>"There's nothing that seems to be standing out in relation to the flu, other than the normal seasonal flu," police spokeswoman Karen Carlson said. "There's definitely nothing having any impact on operations."</p>
<p>David Doyle, the city's director of employee safety and wellness, said the most recent figures show that up to the end of August, absenteeism was lower this year than in 2008.</p>
<p>On average, 4.2 per cent of the city's 12,000 full-, part-time and seasonal staff were away each day for health-related reasons during the first eight months of 2009, compared to 4.7 per cent during the same period last year, he said. While the city is looking at providing staff with shots for the virus, it can't be done now because the vaccine isn't available, he said.</p>

<p>- I just saw some outdoor Christmas lights glowing on a house in my neighbourhood. I'm still cutting the grass. - Can anyone be so terrified of getting H1N1 they are willing to wear a mask, lean on a cane and stand at the end of a three-hour line? - I was having coffee with my boss when I swallowed the wrong way and had a coughing fit. Before I could explain, he ordered me to go home for a week. - If the province wants to speed up the vaccination program, set up clinics in every community hall in the city. - My 72-year-old husband just got home from a five-hour, bone-chilling wait, suffering from hypothermia, but alas, he got his flu shot. Since when did we start living in a Third World country? - It was a shame to see seniors standing outside with walkers, then trying to negotiate the stairs to the second floor for their flu shots. - I see seniors being bused to the clinics to get their shots. They should stay in their lodges where they will be fine.</p>
<p> They don't have to be first, not this time. Let the children go first. - The flu clinic in St. Albert is poorly run. I went on Wednesday after school with the kids, only to be turned away. The next day, I took the kids out of school and we went back. We waited in line for four hours and were almost at the front when we left because I had to go to work. Despite the fact I am in a high-risk group, they would not bump me up the queue. I guess I will have to go back a third time. - People going through chemotherapy treatments have a window of only a few days to get shots before their immune system is impaired. Special clinics should have been set up for people who need the shot for medical reasons. - Has anyone seen a politician in any of the H1N1 vaccine lines?No doubt our overworked health-care personnel will have to go to them. - When any politician says, "Let me be perfectly clear," be prepared for a snowstorm. - If a defence fund is started to help city taxpayers fight a court battle against a bunch of elephant-rights zealots, I will gladly make a contribution. - There's a guy named Mulligan running for mayor in 2010. That's exactly what this city needs:A mulligan. - My husband was able to prove he was exposed to asbestos and he died because of it. Yet the WCB cut me off after he died. They just don't seem to care that I'm waiting for a hip replacement and I have only my pension to live on. What that man with the gun did wasn't right, but I can sure understand why he did it. - Stop this madness now. Bring our soldiers home from Afghanistan before anyone else is killed or maimed. - I've been unemployed for more than a year, EI has run out and I've applied for 30 jobs in the last two weeks alone. I have four part-time jobs; none can guarantee hours, none have benefits and none are worthy of my university or technical training or experience. Am I doing something wrong? - Over the course of the day, I paused for 10 cars to move ahead of me in line. Three of the drivers waved. I'd like to think they at least are doing their part to make the world a more civil place. - I'm watching my figure. I want it right out there where I can see it. - The last time I had general anesthetic for surgery, they told me to count backward to 10. By the time I counted to minus-172, they started to get worried. - The driver screaming obscenities at a parent dropping off his kid at school was the one who looked like an ass, not the guy who was the target for his invective. - I am offended when you call Edmonton "The Chuck."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Climate-change deniers horrified by Pembina report should read it</b>
</div><div>Graham Thomson   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1051 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>If you want to strike fear in Halloween trick or treaters tonight, might I suggest tossing out the front-yard tombstones and plastic ghosts--and instead simply nail to your front door a copy of the new Pembina Institute report on the cost of meeting climate change targets.</p>
<p>The report, released on Thursday, is the stuff of nightmares judging from the horrified response from Conservative politicians and climate-change deniers(and I have to admit there are days I get the two confused).</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach likened the report to the much-hated National Energy Program. "There won't be another wealth transfer to Ottawa under my watch, I can tell you," said a heated Stelmach, who was probably happy to talk about something other than swine flu or his upcoming leadership review. Federal Environment Minister Jim Prentice labelled it "irresponsible," claiming the report's recommendations would lead to a contraction in the economy.</p>
<p>After listening to their shock and outrage you are left with two conflicting conclusions: a) the report-- commissioned by the TD Bank--is a blueprint to destroy the economy; or b) neither Stelmach nor Prentice has actually read it.</p>
<p>After reading the report, I'd go with "b."</p>
<p>In fact, the report is a relatively upbeat document that says not only can we can meet targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions without devastating the economy, we could reduce emissions and "still have a strong growing economy, a quality of life higher than Canadians enjoy today, and continued steady job creation across the country."</p>
<p>Politicians and others who are doing their best to frighten people about the report are inadvertently or deliberately misreading its conclusions. According to the report, Canada's gross domestic product would grow by 27 per cent in the decade from 2010 to 2020 if we did nothing at all to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and simply continued with business as usual. By following the federal government's moderate plans to reduce emissions, the GDP would grow by 25 per cent. If Canada got serious about reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aimed for more stringent, internationally recognized goals, our GDP would grow by 23 per cent.</p>
<p>In other words, our economy would still grow by a healthy amount even if we cut our emissions significantly. Politicians such as Prentice are distorting the numbers when they claim we'd face an economic contraction.</p>
<p>Not only that, the Pembina report (in partnership with the Suzuki Foundation) says the total number of jobs created in the economy would actually suffer if we did nothing to reduce emissions. According to the report, if we continued with business as usual, we'd see 1.8 million jobs added between 2010 and 2020.However, that number would jump by 60,000 jobs to 1.86 million if we aimed for the more stringent goals.</p>
<p>The reason for the projected job growth is tied to the report's other controversial recommendation: introducing a national carbon tax that would funnel money back into the economy.</p>
<p>Such a tax would force large emitters to cut back or pay a penalty. The Pembina report says the price per tonne of carbon dioxide should range from$40 up to $200, depending on our reduction goals--the higher the price, the higher the goal.</p>
<p>The money collected would not be a cash grab to enrich Ottawa's treasury but would be directed back to Canadians, according to the report: "Almost half of this revenue is returned to Canadians in the form of reductions in the rate of personal income tax. Smaller portions are used to fund public investments to reduce GHG emissions, to make payments to individuals to compensate regional variations in household energy cost increases, and to protect the international competitiveness of the most vulnerable manufacturing sectors."</p>
<p>A carbon tax would collect more money from Alberta than from any other part of the country because of our oil and gas industry. But the fact is Alberta has the highest-per-capita emissions of greenhouse gases in the country. Yes, the energy industry has been the engine of our economic growth--at times overheating our growth--but the reality is that in a carbon-constrained world we will have to use some of our energy wealth to pay the climate-change piper.</p>
<p>Even with a carbon tax, one of the report's authors--Matthew Bramley with the Pembina Institute--says Alberta would still have the fastest-growing economy in Canada.</p>
<p>It's not surprising that Premier Ed Stelmach is not embracing the thought of introducing a significant carbon tax which would have energy companies calling for his head even more than they are already over his royalty regime. I say "significant" because although Alberta already has a limited $15-per-tonne carbon tax it is not high enough to spur the kind of emission cuts the Pembina report --and international bodies--say is needed by industrialized countries to fight climate change. The limited $15 tax is, like much of Alberta's climate change plan, misleading people into thinking the province is doing more than it actually is. Under Alberta's current plan, the province will continue to be the fastest-growing source of greenhouse gas emissions in the country.</p>
<p>Stelmach isn't going to do anything significant until Ottawa acts and Ottawa isn't going to act until the United States acts. We are waiting on Washington.</p>
<p>And, based on the foot-dragging and pushback from conservative politicians in the U.S. on environmental issues, we shouldn't be waiting with bated breath. That might be a relief to Canada's Conservative politicians and climate-change deniers but the Pembina report is a wake-up call for us in our comfortable, emission-spewing corner of the world that we're going to have to take climate change more seriously.</p>
<p>We'll be paying the cost sooner or later. If we in the industrialized countries don't act soon, the costs of climate change will only get much higher later.</p>
<p>And to all of you who continue to deny or obfuscate in the face of the scientific evidence on climate change, I have one word: Boo!</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Nathan Carroll tackles taboo; Pastor's new album looks at families, sleep and the joys of making love</b>
</div><div>Sandra Sperounes   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>1058 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>D6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>His first album tackled the touchy subject of death. His second, Nathan Carroll's Last Stop on the Dancing Bear Act, looks at families, sleep, and the joys of making love--a potentially dicey subject for a pastor.</p>
<p>"There's often a taboo around something that's so intrinsically excellent, romantic and wonderful and I just wanted to address it head on," says Carroll, who runs the Worship Life Ministry at the St. Albert Alliance Church.</p>
<p>"I can think of very few things that are more worth singing about.</p>
<p>Not that he's too worried about the reaction from his flock. (After all, the church is hosting Sunday's CD release party.)He did, however, consult one person before including Making Love (Ain't Nothing Like It) on his album of soulful rhythm 'n' blues tunes.</p>
<p>"I had good, long conversations with my wife, making sure she was perfectly comfortable that I was releasing this song," says Carroll.</p>
<p>This juxtaposition--a man who wants permission to rebel--is one of the themes of Nathan Carroll's Last Stop on the Dancing Bear Act. His cover of David Crosby's Almost Cut My Hair sums up his feelings.</p>
<p>"That song is perfect. It says what I wanted to say throughout the whole record," he says. "My inspiration to write this record was this innate desire in all of us to be wild and stand against the suburban domestication that seems so prevalent.</p>
<p>"I'm feeling really personally challenged, even in raising my boys (Gideon, 2-1/2 years old, and Floyd, 1). How can we be a family that's not so worried about being house-trained as we are wanting to be honest and expressive?"</p>
<p>To express his honesty on Nathan Carroll's Last Stop on the Dancing Bear Act required a degree of musical rebellion.</p>
<p>His 2007 debut, The Tie-In to Die-In, was a collection of country-roots tunes. His latest, funded by a $10,000 grant from Rawlco Radio, takes a left turn into old-school soul and R&B -- fuelled by Carroll's smooth vocals, groovy horns, organ swells, gospel-flavoured backup vocals and sensual but syncopated bass lines.</p>
<p>"I would say this style is closer to my boyhood self than any other style," says Carroll. "When I was a kid, it was all about R&B and soul music for me. I remember going to <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> with my mom when I was seven and they had this cheesy collection of oldies cassettes.</p>
<p>"I begged her to buy me one, so she picks a random one of the shelf. It had eight songs on it--all these old Temptations songs. Man, I memorized every word."</p>
<p>Writing his own lyrics doesn't fill Carroll with the same feel-good memories. He says it's the toughest part of the songwriting process for him--and unlike most musicians, he prefers to work on his words before his guitar chords.</p>
<p>His wife Heidi, who sang backup vocals on The Tie-In to Die-In, made it somewhat easier. She wrote most of the lyrics to She's Angry and Won't You Wait for Me?</p>
<p>"She's a perfectionist, eh? She's got a real keen patience to dig in and carve out some excellent lyrics," says Carroll of their kitchen-table collaborations. "It was an awesome surprise to work with her in that way on this record."</p>
<p>As a man who likes to be on both ends of a surprise, he'll likely abandon his current R&B stylings and tackle another genre on his next album. Perhaps some polka or techno tunes? "Or a really obscene gangsta rap record," the pastor laughs. "I like the freedom of being able to explore different styles. For me, it's a big enough challenge to write good songs, let alone live in one stylistic camp.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you what has crossed my mind--because I have two little guys, I'd love to do a kids' record. I think that would be really fun. Raffi, he is awesome. I love his stuff. "</p>
<p>Tickets to Carroll's CD release party are$10 at St. Albert Alliance Church. The show starts at 7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>BETTER LATE THAN NEVER</p>
<p>ZZ Top will perform Saturday, Nov. 28 at the Jubilee Auditorium, according to the hairy rock trio's website. Tickets will go on sale Friday, Nov. 6.</p>
<p>The '80s MTV/MuchMusic staples ( Legs, Sharp Dressed Man) were supposed to perform with Aerosmith on Aug. 11 at Commonwealth Stadium. Unfortunately, the latter's frontman, Stephen Tyler, fell off a stage in South Dakota and injured his shoulder, thereby kiboshing their tour.</p>
<p>Aerosmith recently performed two shows in Hawaii as part of a legal settlement. Fans filed a class-action suit after the rockers cancelled a Maui gig in 2007.Tyler and his bandmates will perform Sunday as part of Abu Dhabi's Formula One festivities.</p>
<p>GIGS ON THE GO</p>
<p>-There's a slight change in plans with Champion's upcoming show at the Starlite Room.</p>
<p>The Montreal DJ/producer and his G-Strings will now perform Wednesday, Nov. 11--NOT Nov. 10. Tickets are $17.50 plus service charges at ticketmaster.caor 780-451-8000.</p>

</div><div>Vicki Hall   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>601 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>E4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Dustin Boyd can't say for certain whether he waged battle this week with the dreaded H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>But the Calgary Flames centre can--and does--sympathize with all those Canadians stuck by themselves at home for fear of spreading something nasty to their friends and co-workers.</p>
<p>"I just lay in bed for four straight days," Boyd said Friday after his first practice back with the National Hockey League team. "I just had all these Lysol wipes--wiping everything down.</p>
<p>"The Xbox is upstairs, and I didn't want to leave my room. So I just watched my TV."</p>
<p>Boyd said he has not undergone tests to determine the exact strain of flu that crunched him harder than a bodycheck from Edmonton Oilers enforcer Steve MacIntyre.</p>
<p>But the symptoms sound awfully similar to those of the so-called swine flu that has thousands of people lined up for hours to get immunized at five clinics around Calgary.</p>
<p>"On Sunday, I just had a little cough," said Boyd, 23. "By Sunday night, was just like a normal flu. Cough, fever, chills, body ache, headache--that kind of stuff.</p>
<p>"No puking or anything, so it was all right."</p>
<p>Boyd hopes to be in the lineup tonight against the Detroit Red Wings after sitting out Wednesday in a 3-2 loss to the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>"I feel good," said Boyd, who skated by himself Thursday. "I'm a little tired from not skating for a while, but today I feel pretty good."</p>
<p>Three NHL players --Colorado goaltender Peter Budaj, Edmonton defenceman Ladislav Smid and Washington winger Quintin Laing-- have H1N1. Islanders centre Doug Weight has also battled the virus. The Columbus Blue Jackets figure Kristian Huselius dealt with it several weeks back.</p>
<p>So Boyd took no chances when he woke up from a nap Sunday and felt just terrible.</p>
<p>His roommate, Eric Nystrom, moved in temporarily with winger David Moss and his family.</p>
<p>"He brought me some soup one day," Boyd said. "Left it outside the house. Chicken noodle. It was really good."</p>
<p>Nystrom dropped off the soup without even saying hello.</p>
<p>"I didn't even go in that place," he said. "The door was closed. I just put it on the front handle of the door, rang the doorbell and left.</p>
<p>"I left him water, Gatorade and some Campbell's soup. That's what he asked for, or else I wouldn't have done it."</p>
<p>Nystrom moved back in Thursday night.</p>
<p>"It's good to be back," he said. "I slept in my own bed last night. Very enjoyable. Had my own stuff. It was nice. I'm happy he was feeling better, so I could get back in there."</p>
<p>On a serious note, Nystrom is happy to have his roomie back as the centreman on the fourth line. In 10 games, Boyd has two goals and six points.</p>
<p>"He's been playing well, so he's got some confidence," he said. "It's good to have him back in there. Nobody likes to be away from the rink, so I'm sure he's excited to be back in there."</p>
<p>Excited doesn't begin to describe it.</p>
<p>"It's nice to be back in the room," he said. "That was a tough five days doing nothing."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alternatives sought to flu shots; Some families leery of H1n1 vaccine</b>
</div><div>Tamara Gignac   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>620 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>T ricia Felber is determined to do whatever she can to protect her two young daughters from the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Her family follows a strict regimen of homeopathic remedies, eats plenty of fruits and vegetables, avoids sugar and strives for a proper night's sleep.</p>
<p>Felber will not, however, allow her children to be immunized. She has doubts about the H1N1 vaccine's safety and even whether it can fight the flu at all.</p>
<p>"To me, it's not worth the risk," said the 35-year-old Calgarian.</p>
<p>"We are following a homeopathic flu protocol and I feel completely safe with that. Homeopathy dates back 200 years. How long has this vaccine been out?"</p>
<p>Demand for free H1N1 shots has overwhelmed Calgary's five flu clinics, forcing health officials to turn people away Friday and Albertans to wait until high-risk people are inoculated first.</p>
<p>The province's supply of flu vaccinations is dwindling and Health Minister Ron Liepert said it could run out completely by next week if people continue to flood clinics at the same pace.</p>
<p>But even as thousands of Calgarians scramble for a shot, others are seeking alternatives to try to prevent or treat the illness, whether it's a cocktail of vitamins or over-the-counter homeopathic remedies.</p>
<p>People are arriving at organic food shops in droves in search of everything from oil of oregano to vitamin D3 and beta carotene in an effort to ward off the flu.</p>
<p>"We're seeing an upswing in demand for products designed to help boost the immune system," said Liam Muzichuk of <span class="companylink">Community Natural Foods</span>.</p>
<p>"If I had to hedge my bets, I would say definitely people are coming in because they don't want a swine flu shot," said Muzichuk.</p>
<p>Federal health officials have repeatedly made the case for inoculation, calling it a choice between a safe and effective preventive vaccine or a very real risk of disease.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, a healthy 13-year-old Ontario died after contracting what seemed like a mild case of the flu.</p>
<p>The vaccine is safe, officials stress. But polls have suggested approximately half of Canadians do not plan to get a shot--a statistic that doesn't surprise Erin Bosch, owner of Xerion Homoeopathie.</p>
<p>She said people are showing up at her clinic "scared to death" about the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"Most of the deaths we've seen are in weakened people. If you build up your immune system, avoid junk food and drink lots of water, you can fight off a phenomenal number of things," said Bosch.</p>
<p>"We don't give the human body enough credit."</p>
<p>Antonin Kodet is a Calgary naturopathic doctor who considers the decision on whether or not to vaccinate a "highly individual" choice.</p>
<p>But he emphasizes that everyone can reduce their risk of sickness by getting enough sleep and plenty of fresh air.</p>
<p>"People who spend more time outside -- provided it is a clean environment -- develop greater resistance and rarely get sick with flus and upper respiratory infections," said Kodet.</p>
<p>Public concern over vaccines shouldn't be simply dismissed, said Dr. Pieter Nieman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>He recommends that parents take a common-sense approach to this year's flu season. "If you just talk about the vaccine and you don't also talk about nutrition and exercise, you're basically standing on one leg," Nieman said. "It's two sides of the coin."</p>

<p>Re: "Vaccine lineups worth the wait," Don Braid, Opinion, Oct. 29.</p>
<p>It's sad and infuriating that we now live in a society so spoiled by its excellent health care that we can look upon medical advancements such as the H1N1 vaccination with scorn and cynicism. These skeptics are deluding themselves and each other while placing the rest of us at risk. If the H1N1 virus comes knocking on their doors this winter and starts kicking the stuffing out of them, will they refuse treatment just as they've refused prevention?</p>

</p>
<p>It's Halloween, so I'm going to dish up something really scary for all Albertans. No, it's not about ghosts, goblins or vampires. It's about the utterly incoherent messaging about the H1N1 virus coming from the upper echelons of the Alberta government.</p>
<p>On Friday, Health Minister Ron Liepert paid the Herald editorial board a visit and his message was more mixed than a witches' brew or your kid's Halloween treat bag.</p>
<p>First, as is Liepert's way, he blasted the media for the grief he's getting from angry citizens forced to stand for hours to get their flu shot. "I don't think it's too much of an extension to say I'm disturbed by the media coverage in this city . . . around opinions formed without all of the facts."</p>
<p>OK, so, tell us, what are all the facts? Here's what he said: "We launched this program with the ask that the first week would be for those who were most susceptible and at high risk. We also launched by encouraging all Albertans to get vaccinated because all of the indicators we had was that far too many people were going to say this, too, will pass and I don't need to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>Huh? Clear yet? 'Bout as clear as the black makeup I'll be smearing on my kids' faces tonight for their zombie costumes. High risk individuals are pregnant women, children, aboriginals and people with respiratory ailments. People over the age of 65 are not at risk. Period.</p>
<p>So what was the message the province delivered on Wednesday, when it became obvious four clinics for Calgarians was not enough and pregnant women with young children were being forced to stand in line for six hours?</p>
<p>The province opened a fifth clinic in Calgary on Wednesday at the Olympic Oval and made it "clear" that it's for high-risk groups and then incomprehensibly informed everyone that those high risk groups are pregnant women, young children and the elderly. Sheesh.</p>
<p>When Liepert was asked how the government could botch the messaging so badly, here's what he said:</p>
<p>"I disagree with you that the messaging has been botched. The elderly are not in the high risk, unless they had some of these other conditions. About Wednesday or Thursday, it was becoming obvious that the elderly were standing in long lines. When they decided to open the fifth clinic, they added the elderly to that. Maybe they shouldn't have, but they were trying to accommodate people who were least able to withstand the lineups, that's why the elderly were added to that," said Liepert.</p>
<p>He said all of this with a straight face. Instead of sending out a message that the elderly should not even be in the lineups, they lumped them in with the high-risk folk and muddied the waters even more.</p>
<p>"What transpired," says Liepert, "is a bit of a fear had set in and the desire to have those who were at high risk to be treated first simply got overwhelmed."</p>
<p>Liepert is right when he says that when news broke on Tuesday that bright-faced Evan Frustaglio, the healthy 13-year-old hockey player from Ontario died of H1N1, parents like me panicked. My husband stood in line for four hours with my twin 12-year-old hockey playing boys--one of whom has a mild case of asthma--on Thursday.</p>
<p>So, what was the government's message on Wednesday, the day after news of the Ontario lad's death broke? Here's a direct quote from Premier Ed Stelmach in Calgary: "We're the province that is offering flu vaccines for every Albertan, not just to the high-risk groups."</p>
<p>Just in case you think that was a one-off mistake, here's what the premier said on Thursday in Edmonton: "We're not asking only those high-risk groups to get the vaccine first. It's open to all."</p>
<p>Thanks for the clarification, Ed! We all feel so much better. So now that all those elderly people who were never at risk of contracting H1N1 in the first place have been told they are welcome to show up at high risk clinics, it's being announced that we may run out of vaccine next week for the real-high risk folk.</p>
<p>"We will run out in all likelihood next week and when we do and shut everything down and then resume operations agin in two or three days, I would bet a fair bit of money around this table right now there will be lineups from here to Lethbridge because people will be so concerned that that's the last of the supply," said Liepert. "That's what we were trying to avoid at the outset."</p>
<p>Wouldn't that be reason to limit the vaccine to high-risk groups, the ones that wind up in emerg on ventilators should they contract this flu?</p>
<p>This version of supply management by creating long, unwieldy lines is ghoulish.</p>
<p>Liepert's editorial board visit was supposed to be reassuring and help us clarify for Albertans what the government's plan is. It was, instead, an apt Halloween present. If you expect a government to be able to put forward a coherent message, be afraid. Be very afraid.</p>

<p>With Calgary's five flu vaccination clinics overwhelmed by demand and shut down early on Friday, Health Minister Ron Liepert made the media rounds to defend his government's handling of its H1N1 program. Meeting with the Herald's editorial board, he himself seemed overwhelmed, muttering at one point "I don't know what to do." In fairness, he was talking about the limited supply of vaccine being produced and the difficulties of distributing it quickly and equitably.</p>
<p>"We never anticipated this kind of take-up out of the chute," he said.</p>
<p>Indeed, it has been an enormous challenge for health officials, with mixed messages coming from all levels, including Health Canada and the World Health Organization. But it is clear that Alberta should have been adamant from the start that only high-risk groups--pregnant women, those under age six, aboriginals and adults with chronic conditions--should get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Liepert says it would have been against privacy policies to query people outside of high-risk groups to see if they qualified for the vaccine. Alberta didn't want to turn anyone away, including seniors, and make them mad, he said.</p>
<p>They should have. Seniors suffered the Depression and horrific wars. They know the meaning of sacrifice. Healthy Albertans, too, will gladly stand aside for those at greatest risk, but only if told clearly that is what must be done.</p>
<p>That still has not been articulated-- not even in yesterday's meeting--and it should.</p>

<p>On Monday:</p>
<p>"Mass clinics started delivering the vaccine across Alberta today, focusing on the highrisk groups first. . . .

<p>--Health Minister Ron Liepert in Edmonton</p>
<p>" Over the course of time the vaccine will be available for all Albertans, but we're asking those that are more susceptible to the flu to receive their vaccine today. We'll ensure that all other Albertans, including those that may not be at risk as much as others, receive their vaccine in the province."</p>

<p>Economy - The swine flu epidemic will have less impact on the U.S. economy than previously feared, some government computer simulations predict.</p>
<p>The computer models suggest the virus will shave a fraction of one per cent from gross domestic product, said Robert Hooks, of the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Health Affairs.</p>
<p>"This is going to have some economic impact to our country, but we expect that it's reasonable and manageable," he said.</p>
<p>The simulations, begun in June, predict the pandemic will have a "rolling effect," Hooks said, striking communities at different times. That will help businesses cope by shifting workers between offices and plants to minimize disruption.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko on Friday ordered a three-week closure of Ukraine's schools and cinemas in the toughest measures adopted yet to combat the swine flu virus in Europe.</p>
<p>"From today, all the school establishments in Ukraine--be they private or public--will be put on three weeks of holiday," she told her cabinet in comments carried on Ukrainian television.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko said the government would also be banning "all public gatherings, every concert and every cinema showing for three weeks."</p>
<p>The government will also introduce "special regimes" to limit the movement of Ukraine's citizens from one region to another for non-urgent purposes, she said. Ukraine has borders with four EU countries.</p>
<p>Tymoshenko also threatened to revoke the licences of pharmacies that failed to stock the appropriate level of anti-flu medicine and masks.</p>

<p>GENEVA - The number of swine flu deaths jumped by 700 in a week, reaching more than 5,700 worldwide since the virus was first uncovered in April, World Health Organization data indicated Friday.</p>
<p>The biggest rise was recorded in the Americas region, where 4,175 deaths have now been reported to the WHO, up 636 from data published last week.</p>
<p>"In the temperate zone of the northern hemisphere, influenza transmission continues to intensify, marking an unusually early start to winter influenza season in some countries," said the WHO.</p>
<p>Fatal cases in Europe rose to at least 281, while those in Asia-Pacific rose to 1,070.</p>
<p>Amid the mounting death toll, the WHO said a single dose of vaccine would provide sufficient immunity.</p>

<p>Trick or treat is not the only question facing Calgary parents today.</p>
<p>Instead many are asking, one dose or two for their children? Or, for expecting moms, whether to get the adjuvanted or non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>These and other flu-related questions were weighing on the minds of parents waiting for flu shots Friday after the World Health Organization changed its message about vaccines.</p>
<p>The health body announced one dose of the H1N1 vaccine may be effective for children aged six months and older, and that pregnant women can be safely immunized with either the adjuvanted (which includes an immune booster) or non-adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>Trellis Wells, a young mother of two, said there isn't enough information being provided to parents--either through the schools or in the media--as she stood at the back of the line with her kids at the Avenida Village clinic in southeast Calgary.</p>
<p>"It's so frustrating," she said. "You just don't know what to do. When you are trying to do the best as a parent. You are trying to make the right decision that's good for them."</p>
<p>Wells was lucky--she got a place in line before 9 a.m., when the clinic began turning people away because there were already thousands of people waiting.</p>
<p>"People are getting a little more panicked," she said, noting there is a concern about the availability of the vaccine, and that they have had some confirmed cases of H1N1 at her children's Okotoks school.</p>
<p>Despite new information from the WHO, the province is sticking with its original position.</p>
<p>Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services, said the province will continue to recommend children receive one half dose of the H1N1 vaccine followed by a second half dose 21 days later, "Until we hear otherwise."</p>
<p>"I know the World Health Organization has said maybe one dose of the vaccine might be enough for children six months to 10 years of age-- that is something that is still being researched.</p>
<p>"We've given the children we've seen in that age group the one dose and we still think they need to wait 21 days as a minimum before they come back for a second dose. If things change in that time, then we can adjust to that," MacDonald said Friday.</p>
<p>As for which vaccine pregnant women should receive, MacDonald said that in Canada a decision has been made to offer expectant mothers a non-adjuvanted vaccine when it becomes available.</p>
<p>An adjuvant is an additive that helps boost the body's immune system response to the vaccine. The unadjuvanted vaccine was ordered for pregnant women after the WHO recommended in July that countries make it an option if possible because there was less clinical data on the use of adjuvanted flu vaccines in pregnant women.</p>
<p>New data shows there is no reason to favour one vaccine over the other, the WHO said Friday.</p>
<p>Still, not all pregnant women are ready to roll up their sleeves. Some are sequestering themselves at home while they make a decision about the vaccination.</p>
<p>The WHO's latest recommendation -- that either licensed H1N1 vaccine can be used in pregnant women -- only causes more confusion, says Calgarian Tina Cormier.</p>
<p>"I would definitely say it's caused some stress in pregnant women," said the 39-year-old expectant mom whose second child is due in February.</p>
<p>"I just feel I don't have enough information to make a decision," said Cormier, who remains undecided about whether she will line up with her husband and 11-month-old daughter to get the shot.</p>
<p>Cormier plans to hold off on a decision until her next doctor visit in mid-November, when she can air her concerns and pose her questions to a medical professional.</p>
<p>Indeed, doctors are fielding questions from increasingly perplexed parents of young patients as flu season gets underway. The biggest problem, says Calgary pediatrician Dr. Peter Nieman, is parents are not sure where they should be getting their information.</p>
<p>"Unless you have a (reliable) source of information on a daily basis, you will not be on the ball," he said, adding that what compounds the confusion is the fact that official health information sources like the World Health Organization, Centers for Disease Control in the U.S., the Government of Canada and Alberta Health Services have not always been on the same page with their swine flu vaccination recommendations.</p>
<p>"Too many bodies trying to speak on this topic confuses the public," he said by phone from his practice in southwest Calgary.</p>
<p>"If you're going to get information, you have to go to more than one (source)."</p>
<p>But conflicting information can work to erode the public's trust, he said.</p>
<p>Despite the WHO's latest message, Nieman, like Alberta Health Services, still recommends children between the ages of six months and 10 years should get two half doses of the vaccine. He also recommends pregnant women get immunized, preferably with the non-adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>"I would say, if it's possible, get the one that's available without the adjuvant--just be cautious,"</p>
<p>"You can't play it more safe than that."</p>

<p>What our readers say about wait times and their experiences at vaccination clinics:</p>
<p>Julia Marshall</p>
<p>I went the Brentwood clinic. . . . I got in the massive lineup shortly after 9:30 a.m. and was told that I probably wouldn't get in before the clinic closed at 3:30 p.m. The estimated wait time was more than six hours. So I left and went back to work.</p>
<p>I'm not high risk. I'm an otherwise healthy 27-year-old, but people at work are dropping like flies with flu-related symptoms and I don't want to take any chances.</p>
<p>Now I'm contemplating whether or not I should even bother getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>Sheila Brown-Eckersley</p>
<p>My daughter and I, we were turned away from the northeast clinic this morning. She is in a high-risk group, as am I, since I work in child care as well as care for her. I think the decision to open this up to all Albertan's was wrong and short-sighted of this government. . . . I am now faced with trying to go either tomorrow or Sunday to get her a shot, and I would forgo my shot if it meant my kids would get it.</p>
<p>Lisa Wilson</p>
<p>I stood in line today for 2½ hours with my 20-month-old and 7½-month-old sons. We . . . were out in the cold for the duration of the wait. The line cut off one family in front of us. . . . We have been told of the importance of high-risk groups (my sons) getting the shots, but then we are turned away because the clinic is only open until 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Jodie Tosh</p>
<p>Sadly, my 18-month-old son, asthmatic husband and myself, being seven months pregnant, were turned away at the Calgary clinics today. Seniors, pregnant women and children are not in a position to be lining up at 3 in the morning, to be standing in six-plus hour lineups, nor to be turned away when lineups are filling up with those not high-risk.</p>
<p>Giovanna Brookes</p>
<p>I went to the Richmond location about 9:20 and the security guard at the door said they were already past capacity and wouldn't be letting anyone else in for the day. . . . I am a mother with two small children (ages two and four) and my parents are over 60. My mother meets four of the high-risk categories . . .</p>
<p>I was born and raised in Calgary and today is the first time that I have felt like this city and this province have failed me and my family.</p>
<p>Lisa Perron</p>
<p>At 9:45 a.m. today, I was told that the Richmond clinic was closed for the day. . . . The government of Alberta created this chaos with their apocalyptic scenario and lack of planning! I am so scared just to think of how it's going to be when "thousands of people will be hit by the virus . . . !" But, hey, who are we to even complain . . . after all, we're just the people who vote!</p>
<p>SB</p>
<p>Not only do I have severe chronic asthma, my son has asthma and my husband is an essential service worker. We have been turned away twice for the shot due to the lineups. . . . So, we apologize in advance if you catch H1N1 from people like us with weakened immune systems and from consistent exposure to others that may have H1N1.</p>
<p>Karen</p>
<p>I am very concerned about the handling of the pandemic plan. Ron and his super-board are so concerned about cutting costs they lose sight of the big picture. In the past (for regular flu vaccines) casual staff was brought in. Now there is a hiring freeze. What happens when the overworked staff gets the flu? There does not seem to be a plan .</p>
<p>Equality?</p>
<p>I don't like being told that simply because I'm not old, young or sick already that it's fine for me to catch the flu, lose income because I have to stay home to be responsible and be happy about it. If I want a shot, I should get a shot. . . . Don't tell me I have to play Russian roulette with my health while "target groups" get in line first.</p>

</p>
<p>Anger. Frustration. Confusion.</p>
<p>These words are becoming synonymous with H1N1 and the much-criticized vaccination program launched to combat the new flu virus.</p>
<p>They were certainly part of Jillian Brodeur's vocabulary Friday, when she spent two hours driving around the city, an ear tuned to the radio for updated information, looking for a clinic that would take her and her children for a shot.</p>
<p>Lineups for the H1N1 immunization clinics started early Friday and shut down by noon, leaving many people angry, frustrated and confused about the vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>By the time the five local clinics opened their doors at 8:30 a.m., thousands of people were waiting to get in.</p>
<p>Some clinics -- including one at Avenida Village and another in the former children's hospital on Richmond Road --were turning people away 80 minutes later.</p>
<p>"It was frustrating," said Brodeur, who left home at 10 a.m. in a bid to find a clinic allowing people to line up.</p>
<p>Brodeur started her two-hour journey at the Richmond Road clinic, where she was greeted with a sign on the door that noted no new clients were being accepted "due to an extremely high call volume of people waiting in line."</p>
<p>Staff told her to go to the clinic at the Olympic Oval, but she didn't even make it past the parking lot attendants who suggested she try the nearby Brentwood clinic.</p>
<p>"I was driving to Brentwood when I heard on the radio that people were calling in to say that Richmond, the university and Brentwood were closed," she said. "So then I just said, OK, let's go to Avenida . . . but when I got there, it was closed."</p>
<p>Similar lineups could occur today and Sunday, since the clinics are only open from 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Some people who were turned away Friday called it ridiculous that the clinics weren't open for longer, but Alberta Health Services said the reduced hours on the weekend was always part of the rollout plan.</p>
<p>"We have staff who are assigned to work the clinics and the hours are based on the staff," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, Calgary's deputy medical officer of health. "Our staff have been going full tilt."</p>
<p>So far, an estimated 97,000 doses have been administered to people in the Calgary region.</p>
<p>MacDonald reminded Calgarians that the flu clinics will be running for the next couple of months. "We're going to be doing this for a long time. . . . There's going to be plenty of opportunity for people to get the vaccine."</p>
<p>That is, if there's any left. Provincial health officials concede that Alberta's allotment may run out if this kind of demand continues.</p>
<p>For those at the new assessment clinic, which opened Friday at the Richmond Road Diagnostic&Treatment Centre, it may have been too late as they were exhibiting symptoms of H1N1.</p>
<p>"It's my daughter," said Bhupinder Mann, who was 139th in line at the diagnostic clinic. "She is 14 months and she was sick yesterday and has a little cough, too."</p>
<p>Mann, who wore a mask to protect herself and others, said she hadn't gotten a flu shot.</p>
<p>Back in the vaccination line at the same location, many people said they decided to get the shot Friday because they are worried about a potential vaccine shortage.</p>
<p>Melissa Tennyson, whose sister held her spot in line for four hours so she and her son could get the shot, said she was spooked by the message coming from the province.</p>
<p>"We were going to get it anyway," she said, "but we thought today would be the time to bite the bullet."</p>
<p>Similar sentiments were expressed at the Avenida clinic, where there were 1,500 people in line by 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Bryan Syryda, 23, arrived at 3:30 a.m. to find himself second in line, where he put his lawn chair on the sidewalk outside the temporary clinic and returned to his car to stay warm. His girlfriend, Melanie Laxton, arrived three hours later to join him.</p>
<p>Similar strategies were in place at the Richmond Road clinic.</p>

<p>Re: But Is The Vaccine A Good Idea?, letter to the editor, Oct. 29.</p>
<p>Letter-writer Bruce Winter asks for a 100% guarantee that the N1H1 vaccine will have absolutely no side effects. Unfortunately, no substance or activity has such a guarantee attached to it. I can, however, offer Mr. Winter a consolation prize. I can definitely guarantee that his chances of harmful side effects from the H1N1 virus are higher than his chances of contracting side effects from the vaccine.</p>
<p>Let me put it into perspective: Your odds of contracting H1N1 are about as good as the chances of you playing the lottery. Your odds of contracting lasting side effects from the vaccine are about as good as your chances of winning the lottery.</p>

<p>I am not a physician but I do have a close relative, a fairly healthy 18-year-old who was vaccinated for yellow fever and meningitis in May of 2009. Immediately thereafter</p>
<p>he became ill. Not only was his body very weak and in pain, more frightening, he became suicidal. Now, five months later, he is diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome and has taken a leave from university.</p>
<p>Thankfully, he seems to be on the road to healing, however a full recovery is not certain.</p>
<p>Is it any wonder that the majority of Quebecers do not want the H1N1 vaccine?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>THE KILLER NEVER LEFT - Long forgotten, TB explodes on northern reserves</b>

<p>11He puts it next to the others on a wooden shelf in the living room, near where his young son and daughter are sleeping on mattresses. Denechezhe, 42, will take the samples to the nurse, but it could be weeks before anyone knows whether his recent coughing fits and night sweats are what he fears.</p>
<p>Denechezhe calls it "the sickness," the disease that just won't go away.</p>
<p>He's watched tuberculosis devastate his family and plague his community for years.</p>
<p>Northlands First Nation in Lac Brochet, one of Manitoba's most remote communities, has earned a dubious distinction as a global TB hot spot. It and another Manitoba community health officials will not name recorded the highest rates of TB in the world for two decades. Until 2004, Lac Brochet remained one of the world's worst-affected communities.</p>
<p>More than a decade ago, Denechezhe watched his ex-wife nearly die of TB of the brain in a Winnipeg hospital isolation room. He and all 18 people who lived in the same three-bedroom house tested positive for TB, too. He was supposed to wear a mask and take medication for nine months to cure his "sleeping TB."</p>
<p>But Denechezhe doesn't trust medication, not even Tylenol. He stopped taking the TB pills when he couldn't handle the intense side effects of nausea and fatigue. He failed to finish his medication again two years ago, after a nurse warned him the disease could strike at any time.</p>
<p>Now, he's been coughing for weeks and worries he's already infected his young son who started coughing days go.</p>
<p>"Maybe it'll kill me. I don't know," said Denechezhe. "But this sickness seems to be carrying on. We get rid of it for a little while, but it seems to pop up left and right."</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It's been more than three decades since the last sanatorium in the province shut its doors and tuberculosis faded in the minds of most Manitobans.</p>
<p>But TB never went away. It is still rampant in First Nation communities in northern Manitoba. It's a medical illness propagated by non-medical factors, tangled in a historical and political web that has long neglected the poverty that helps TB survive.</p>
<p>TB is a barometer for overall health: where there is poverty and suffering, there is TB. Plain and simple, it is a symptom of poverty, a byproduct of overcrowded homes, malnutrition and poor overall health.</p>
<p>That same deadly mix let H1N1 flourish in the north this summer and made TB a scourge on Manitoba reserves for a century.</p>
<p>Medical experts warned for years that a major problem would arise in the North if TB outbreaks and the living conditions that contribute to them were not addressed. The warning went unheeded, and the disease exploded in places such as Lac Brochet five years ago. Now, Manitoba has one of the highest TB rates in the country.</p>
<p>In northern Manitoba, living conditions on some reserves are often described as Third World -- many houses are decrepit, some don't have toilets or running water, and multiple families are crammed under one roof. Inadequate hygiene, rotting walls and close quarters make reserves ripe for the spread of an airborne disease. When one person gets sick, everybody gets sick.</p>
<p>In 1937, TB officials noted that overcrowded homes and poor living conditions on reserves contributed to the high rate of disease among First Nations. In 2009, as many as 18 people are crammed into three-bedroom houses at Lac Brochet.</p>
<p>It's no wonder that community recorded some of the highest TB rates in the world - more than 600 cases per 100,000, more than 100 times what it should be. By comparison, the national rate in Canada is five cases per 100,000. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, the rate is slightly below 400 cases per 100,000.</p>
<p>Last year, the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs petitioned Canada's Auditor General to investigate what federal health officials are doing to control the rising rates of infectious diseases such as TB on reserves. Grand Chief Ron Evans hasn't heard back. He has no idea how many cases of TB surface on reserves because federal and provincial health officials refuse to divulge that information, citing privacy reasons. Evans said they can't solve the problem until they have all the facts.</p>
<p>"My suspicions are if they provide that information, it will be so alarming they would have to put resources toward the root causes, which is of course overcrowding, issues of poverty, the lack of proper running water and sewage," he said.</p>
<p>The Free Press hit the same roadblock. Provincial officials refused to disclose the number of cases on reserve, saying to do so would "harm relations" with the federal government. It took months through sources, documents and visiting remote communities to uncover which reserves have been hit hard by TB.</p>
<p>This is the first time this information has been made public.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lac Brochet's Dene community lives in one of the most remote places in Manitoba - the northwestern corner of the province, about 200 kilometres north of Lynn Lake. A group of families broke away from Brochet to settle in Lac Brochet in the early 1970s.</p>
<p>Northlands First Nation was to be a remote haven where the Dene could hunt caribou, fish and live off the land. The isolation was supposed to preserve their traditional ways of life. Instead it exacerbated a flurry of health and social problems in recent years.</p>
<p>Few people have jobs, and there's no way off the reserve except to fly out for a medical appointment or brave the 13-hour, white-knuckle ride on the winter road to Thompson.</p>
<p>Denechezhe said people are cooped up in cramped quarters during the long winter, an invitation for TB to spread.</p>
<p>"It's just frustrating sometimes to even talk about it, and the more you talk about it the angrier you get," he said.</p>
<p>In 2001, Indian and Northern Affairs estimated there was a shortfall of 8,500 houses on northern reserves such as Denechezhe's and close to half of existing homes required renovations. Since then, the shortage has worsened, largely due to limited construction and a birthrate twice the Canadian average.</p>
<p>The reserve baby boom has left many young families homeless. In Lac Brochet, close to 1,000 residents live in 135 houses. People like Denechezhe are among the hidden homeless who crowd into relatives' homes because they have nowhere else to stay.</p>
<p>He and two of his children live in his mother's two-bedroom house with five other family members. The grey house looks nearly identical to the other dozen sandwiched close together in "central" Lac Brochet on a slope near the lake. The two bedrooms and one bathroom are the only divided rooms in the house, and there is little room left for people and furniture in the small space.</p>
<p>Denechezhe sleeps on the couch in the living room; his son and daughter sleep on mattresses on the living room floor.</p>
<p>The washer and dryer are crammed in front of one of two exits -- something that Denechezhe worries could be disastrous if fire broke out.</p>
<p>"I'm 42 years old, and I'm still living with my mom. It's not supposed to be like that," said Denechezhe, who works in the band office.</p>
<p>Half of Lac Brochet houses were included in a recent study and nearly half of those housed at least one person who had contacted TB. Most of the houses are overcrowded, with an average of eight people per household - four times the Canadian average.</p>
<p>"Size matters," said Linda Larcombe, an anthropologist and disease researcher with the University of Manitoba who studies the spread of diseases in First Nations. "It makes sense that (in) a smaller home with more people in it, your risk of contracting airborne and aerosolized disease is going to increase."</p>
<p>More than half the houses studied had visible mould. Medical experts say it takes a strong immune response to ward off TB germs, so an individual whose immune system is busy battling the effects of mould may not be able to fight off TB as well.</p>
<p>According to a 2003 Auditor General report, many on-reserves houses have mould problems due to improper maintenance, poor ventilation and construction and overcrowding. Some Lac Brochet houses have so much mould they are literally decaying from the inside.</p>
<p>Indian Affairs did not respond to repeated requests for an interview, but sent an e-mail statement saying it will spend about $75 million to improve on-reserve housing in the next two years, part of the economic stimulus package.</p>
<p>Northlands First Nation Chief Joe Dantouze said the problem hasn't been solved and the community doesn't have enough money to build new houses or repair others also rotten with mould. That draws criticism from some residents who claim houses are allotted based entirely on a social pecking order.</p>
<p>In Lac Brochet, residents refer to the area where the chief and a lucky few live as Beverly Hills, a row of bi-level houses atop a ridge overlooking the centre of town. Everywhere else, families crowd into small houses with two or three bedrooms and no basements.</p>
<p>Martin St. Pierre shines a flashlight in the crawl space under Stephen Tssessaze's house to illuminate a black wall so corroded by mould it's soft to the touch. The beam of light uncovers a patch of long, white mushrooms growing from a crack in the foundation. Thin strips of last year's withered, slimy mushrooms appear to drip down the putrid wall.</p>
<p>St. Pierre does plumbing work for the band in Lac Brochet. He said he sees too many houses that should be condemned - including others just like this one on the west side of town. Here, St. Pierre said, houses are in a low-lying area where spring run-off drains into the crawl space where moisture gets trapped.</p>
<p>The gag-inducing sight of patches of fungi and pervasive rot is overwhelming, even for St. Pierre.</p>
<p>"When I come through a house like this and there's kids in there, you feel bad, you know? To live in a house like this..." St. Pierre said.</p>
<p>Tssessaze lives with his two young boys and his girlfriend. The pungent stench of damp decay is unmistakable. It fills your nostrils when you walk through the front door. Tssessaze said his kids get sick a lot and he often has trouble breathing. He peers at the white fungi in the underbelly of his house, before a solemn look envelops his face.</p>
<p>"It's too much, right?"</p>

<p>Government would rather</p>
<p>you didn't read this series The Free Press began an investigation into TB on Manitoba reserves in spring 2008, but the story stalled when provincial officials refused to disclose the number of cases.</p>
<p>Free Press health reporter Jen Skerritt's Freedom of Information request for the number was denied. Provincial officials claimed releasing it could harm its relationship with the federal government which is responsible for health care on reserves. The province's ombudsman upheld that decision.</p>
<p>The ombudsman's March 2009 report said federal health officials and some First Nation chiefs were concerned releasing the information would jeopardize their ability to manage the infectious disease. Federal officials also argued the information could stigmatize the communities.</p>
<p>"It's an excuse they're using to cover up inadequacies," said Dr. Earl Hershfield, former director of the province's TB control program.</p>
<p>It took months of in-depth research - via sources, documents and visits to remote communities -- for the Free Press to discover which reserves have been hit by TB and why. This is the story.</p>

<p>THEY were up before sunrise, lining up hours before the clinics opened in hope of getting a shot before the province ran out of the H1N1 vaccine.Here are a few snapshots from the H1N1 waiting game at Grant Park Shopping Centre, which, at 7:15 a.m., was a ghost town except for some mall walkers and the few dozen people waiting for their needles:</p>
<p>Susan Smid was one of hundreds of Winnipeggers turned away from a crowded H1N1 flu vaccine clinic Thursday evening, so she was bound and determined to be near the front of the line before sunrise Friday morning. "I have some health issues that I have to be careful with," she said. "I made up my mind to be here early. I don't want to have to wait until December. They say it takes two weeks to get into your system and protect you. I want the shot now."</p>
<p>Pamela Lousmann, a cancer survivor, said for her, getting the vaccine was a no-brainer.</p>
<p>"My spleen was removed two years ago because of the cancer. My doctor told me, 'Get your butt over there.' I had to be inoculated," she said, sipping her coffee next to Smid. "I have four children... I need to be here for them."</p>
<p>David Kroft suffers from asthma, as do some of his kids. He got to the front of the line at 6:30 a.m., and the rest of his family was heading down to Grant Park a bit later in the morning.</p>
<p>Kroft, a lawyer in the city, said participating in a mass vaccination is something he never imagined doing.</p>
<p>"This is all new to my generation," he said. "This is just not part of our psyche. It's the first time we've ever had to deal with something like this before." Health officials said Thursday the province could run out of the H1N1 vaccine early next week, and it could be a day or two before another shipment arrives. Kroft said he remains hopeful all Manitobans are respecting the priority list.</p>
<p>"I look down the line and all I see are friendly faces. I believe the majority of people understand the situation, and that the honour system will work out," he said.</p>

<p>"When the captain of the ship says, 'Women and children first,' they don't end off with, 'If you feel like it.' "</p>
<p>-- unsolicited reader comment.</p>
<p>It is a scenario not unlike jumping the lifeboat queue on a sinking ocean liner.</p>
<p>Winnipeggers who are supposed to wait their turn are lining up in front of pregnant women and little children and the others who are supposed to be the priority for dwindling supplies of rationed H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>So why aren't some Winnipeggers letting pregnant women and little children, people of aboriginal ancestry and the health-compromised go first?</p>
<p>What are they thinking?</p>
<p>People had been lining up at the Grant Park clinic three hours before it opened at 9:30 a.m.</p>
<p>By the time I arrived around noon, the wait was three hours and counting. Except for the obvious examples -- a pregnant woman, a two-year-old dressed up as a wand-waving Halloween fairy, or the 97-year-old man in a wheelchair -- it wasn't that easy to tell those who should be there from those who shouldn't.</p>
<p>At first, I randomly asked people if they were getting a shot and, if so, were they from a priority group.</p>
<p>One of the first I approached was a 32-year-old mother who was there to get a flu shot with her four-year-old daughter.</p>
<p>The daughter qualified because she was under five. The mother didn't because she was married.</p>
<p>"But I'm her primary caregiver. I'm concerned if I get sick, what will happen. I guess my husband could take care of her."</p>
<p>Then she said something surprising.</p>
<p>Her husband had been there earlier, but left because he felt guilty.</p>
<p>"He was thinking about it and then he saw the line and said, 'I'm not on the priority list.' "</p>
<p>I don't know if she decided to get the shot anyway.</p>
<p>But I know the next person I asked definitely did. The woman appeared to be about 40 and flashed a badge identifying her as a home-care worker for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>She said she didn't know if that qualified her for a flu shot.</p>
<p>"But I don't care," she said sharply.</p>
<p>That sounded selfish and I told her so. As it turned out, when I checked with the WRHA, she qualified for both shots.</p>
<p>The flu shot.</p>
<p>And the one I gave her.</p>
<p>By the time I approached a couple who stood out because they weren't with kids, I had come up with a less confrontational question.</p>
<p>Or so I thought.</p>
<p>Do you know who's on the priority list?</p>
<p>"What priority list?" the woman replied haughtily over her shoulder. "There is no priority list. They'll give it to anyone."</p>
<p>Health Minister Teresa Oswald had expressly asked Manitobans to abide by the priority list for the sake of people who need the vaccine most. But this woman had decided to treat the WRHA's policy of not challenging anyone who asked for a flu shot as an open invitation.</p>
<p>How charming.</p>
<p>There was something about the father standing farther back in line with his children that also made him stand out.</p>
<p>Two of his three children were teenagers who don't qualify as a priority group. It became apparent Iraq-national Ahmed Al-Hassan knew his four-year-old qualified for the shot even if his healthy 13- and 18-year-old didn't.</p>
<p>But that it didn't matter to him.</p>
<p>There was nothing arrogant about his tone, though. Or his attitude.</p>
<p>He understood the government had its priority list. But he had his, too.</p>
<p>"The priority for me is my kids."</p>
<p>He said he wouldn't be getting the shot himself.</p>
<p>Then there was the 42-year-old woman who blushed when I approached her. Joan Gillespie said she wasn't on the priority list, but she wasn't waiting to get the flu shot either.</p>
<p>She was simply holding a place in line for someone who qualified for the shot, yet she was still uncomfortable.</p>
<p>"I feel funny even standing in line, holding someone's place," Joan said. "Because I don't belong here."</p>
<p>Joan went on.</p>
<p>"If there was a child sick with leukemia and a healthy person got the shot and the child was turned away, I would feel so bad and so guilty with the me-first attitude."</p>
<p>So why aren't some Winnipeggers letting pregnant women and little children go first? What are they thinking?</p>
<p>It can get complicated, but basically the answer is pretty simple.</p>
<p>They're thinking about themselves.</p>

<p>FIVE schools in southwest New Brunswick closed Friday with H1N1 as the likely cause. Provincial officials say the schools closed because of a shortage of staff. An official with the province's Education Department says it's likely at least of some of those who are sick have H1N1. The H1N1 virus has also forced the closure of schools in Vancouver and Conne River, Newfoundland.</p>
<p>QUEBEC has begun demanding identification before doling out H1N1 vaccinations after a chaotic scene at one injection site that was flooded with out-of-towners and low-priority patients. The appeal comes after health officials were overwhelmed this week at the first vaccination site opened near Montreal, at an old car dealership in the small town of St-Eustache.</p>
<p>THE World Health Organization says pregnant women can get immunized against H1N1 using the same vaccine as the general population. An expert committee advising the WHO released a report saying vaccine that contain adjuvants -- or compounds that boost the responsiveness of the immune system -- are just as safe as vaccines that don't contain the additive.</p>

<p>Chicago Blackhawks captain Jonathan Toews missed his fourth straight game because of a concussion, sitting out Friday night against Montreal.</p>
<p>Toews hasn't resumed skating after a crushing open-ice hit from Vancouver's Willie Mitchell on Oct.21. Toews is listed as day-to-day.</p>
<p>"The progress hasn't been exactly where we wanted it," Chicago coach Joel Quenneville said. "There's been some progress, but at the same time, we're just waiting to see."</p>
<p>After Friday, the Blackhawks don't play again until Thursday night at Phoenix, followed by a game the next night at Colorado.</p>
<p>Quenneville said Toews will make the trip with the team.</p>
<p>"We've got the weekend here and a couple of days next week," Quenneville said. "Hopefully we can get him back on the ice and back out there."</p>
<p>TURCO SITS OUT: Dallas Stars goalie Marty Turco has flu-like symptoms and did not play against the Florida Panthers.</p>
<p>Dallas recalled goaltender Matt Climie from Texas of the AHL before the Stars' home game on Friday night against the Panthers.</p>
<p>Climie played in five games for the Texas Stars, compiling a 2-1-2 record with a 1.35 goals-against average and a .954 save percentage.</p>
<p>WINGS LOSE FILPPULA: Red Wings forward Valtteri Filppula is out indefinitely after breaking his right wrist.</p>
<p>Filppula was injured Thursday night in a loss in Edmonton. Between Joey MacDonald and Ryan Hamilton, the Toronto Marlies had both ends of the ice covered.</p>
<p>MAC IS BACK: Joey MacDonald posted a shutout while Jeff Hamilton had a pair of goals as the Marlies snapped a two-game losing streak by dropping the visiting Adirondack Phantoms 3-0.</p>
<p>MacDonald was making his first start with the Marlies since the first game of the season, after spending the majority of October with the Leafs. The Marlies (4-3-2) had surrendered an average of 39 shots over the past three games.</p>
<p>MAJORS ROLL ON: Corey Bureau had a goal and an assist and Devante Smith-Pelly added a pair of assists as the Mississauga St. Michael's Majors extended their winning streak to six games with a 4-3 win over visiting Peterborough.</p>
<p>CIS HIT BY FLU: Two players on the University of Waterloo women's hockey team have been confirmed with H1N1 and five more have flu-like symptoms according to Bob Copeland, Waterloo's director of athletics.</p>
<p>As a result, the university has postponed regular season games this weekend with York on Saturday and U of T on Sunday.</p>

<p>The federal government insists that the new H1N1 swine flu vaccine is perfectly safe. But it has agreed to cover the cost of any lawsuits launched against manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> should something go wrong.</p>
<p>And it admits that it approved the vaccine, known as Arepanrix, before Glaxo finished conducting any clinical trials on it.</p>
<p>Does this make you feel confident about the vaccine that public health officials want everyone to take but, it seems, can't yet deliver?</p>
<p>As someone who expects to get the shot, I admit it unnerves me.</p>
<p>The problem, it seems, is that Ottawa ran out of time to test the vaccine properly.</p>
<p>With the flu season starting and no clinical results from the Canadian vaccine yet in, the government decided to rely instead on tests of what Health Canada's website calls "a closely similar" H1N1 vaccine manufactured for the European market by Glaxo and known as Pandemrix.</p>
<p>The European Medicines Agency approved Pandemrix a month ago following clinical trials involving 129 healthy adults between the ages of 18 and 60.</p>
<p>But so far, according to the Health Canada website, there have been no tests on children or those over 60 - for either vaccine.</p>
<p>Instead, the federal government is relying largely on results from what Health Canada calls a "mock" vaccine based on an entirely different strain of flu.</p>
<p>Yet even there, according to information posted on the Health Canada website, testing is spotty.</p>
<p>In particular, there are no clinical data available on how any kind of flu vaccine using so-called adjuvants (materials mixed in to make a dose go farther) affects children from ages 3 to 6 and 10 to 17.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Reuters reports that Glaxo, which expects an additional $1.66 billion (U.S.) this year in H1N1 vaccine sales, is poised to make more from swine flu than any other drug manufacturer.</p>
<p>For weeks, the federal government has refused to say whether it would follow Washington's lead and somehow shield Canada's sole H1N1 vaccine maker from lawsuits.</p>
<p>Under U.S. law, Washington can ban lawsuits against drug companies and others in the event of a serious health emergency. This summer, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius extended this protection to anyone involved in manufacturing, distributing and prescribing American swine flu vaccines.</p>
<p>While Ontario law already protects public health officials from potential lawsuits, no statute - federal or provincial - shields vaccine manufacturers. This has left Prime Minister Stephen Harper's government with only one way to ease Glaxo's potential legal problems - opening its wallet.</p>
<p>Yesterday, in response to questions from the Star, Glaxo announced that the government has agreed to do just that.</p>
<p>"Subject to some restrictions, Canada has agreed to indemnify GSK (Glaxo) for the H1N1 vaccine," a company spokeswoman said in an email.</p>
<p>"It's standard practice for governments to indemnify vaccine manufacturers in situations like these."</p>
<p>Standard practice perhaps. But with the population alternately angered, spooked and confused by this pandemic, this is hardly likely to raise public confidence in a vaccine that's never been properly tested in this country.</p>
<p>At one level, it's irritating for the general population to learn, as they did yesterday, that their swine flu inoculations are to be further delayed.</p>
<p>But perhaps this delay will give researchers more time to figure out whether the vaccine we are all supposed to take is as safe as it's supposed to be.</p>

<p>Victims of the province's biggest public health failure reached a $17.5 million settlement Friday in their class-action lawsuit over botched breast cancer tests.</p>
<p>The suit was launched in 2006 after mistakes were detected on tests that play an important role in determining the most appropriate course of treatment for men and women with breast cancer. In all, at least 425 patients had their tests botched from 1997 to 2005.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Fragile' Christmas in store as dollar, inventories wobble</b>
</div><div>Dana Flavelle   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>The day before Halloween, store racks were still jammed with $30 costumes, but inexpensive accessories, like cats' ears, were sold out at some retailers, including <span class="companylink">Wal-Mart</span> and Value Village.</p>
<p>"I wished we'd had more of them," said a store clerk in Scarborough.</p>
<p>That may become a more familiar refrain heading into the Christmas season, as retailers who cut inventories sharply after last year's rout find they don't have enough of the right product to match demand.</p>
<p>With the economic recovery still soft, holiday sales could be easily derailed by any number of unpredictable factors, from the H1N1 flu virus to the gyrating Canadian dollar, experts warn.</p>
<p>"We're calling it a fragile Christmas. It's okay, but it could easily get broken," said Brent Houlden, national retail specialist at consulting firm Deloitte in Toronto.</p>
<p>But an added dimension this year is tight inventories and increasingly volatile conditions that make it tougher than ever for retailers to predict how consumers might respond to specific offers.</p>
<p>"It's very difficult for retailers to forecast demand, particularly during these tough times," said Willy Kruh, global chairman of consumer markets for consulting firm KPMG.</p>
<p>While there's always at least one hot Christmas item in short supply - recall the frenzy over the unexpectedly popular Furby, a fuzzy interactive creature, or long lineups for the first-generation Xbox 360 video-game console - industry experts say retailers are finding it harder than ever to forecast consumer demand.</p>
<p>Everything, from the economy to the weather, has become so much more volatile.</p>
<p>Early indications are consumers plan to spend cautiously this season. Unemployment is at its highest level in decades and a high dollar will tempt more Canadians to shop at U.S. stores and websites where distressed retailers have slashed prices, experts predict.</p>
<p>A Deloitte survey shows half of Canadians plan to spend the same while 44 per cent plan to spend less this Christmas compared with last year. One by KPMG shows 53 per cent of Canadians have changed their shopping habits permanently since the start of the recession, with more people trading down to cheaper stores and products.</p>
<p>Retailers have been similarly tentative in placing their Christmas orders. They've slashed the number of items they've purchased and skewed their orders toward lower-priced items.</p>
<p>Still, there's always a risk they'll miss the mark.</p>
<p>"It's a tight balancing act," says Kruh. Carry too little merchandise, and you risk losing a sale when the customer wants or needs that item and the store is out of stock. But carry too much and you risk getting stuck with unsold merchandise that has to be dumped at a discount, he explains.</p>
<p>Some vertically integrated retailers, like Gap and Lululemon, have moved to assure investors they're prepared for any unexpected uptick in demand.</p>
<p>They say they have bolts of fabric waiting to be cut or dyed to just the right item. And they're using factories here at home to supplement orders from China, thereby avoiding the high cost of flying merchandise at short notice.</p>
<p>But in other categories, consumers may simply find themselves out of luck.</p>
<p>"The real fear I have this year is inventories are so down, if something's hot and you don't shop early, it will be sold out. Like these netbooks (small, light, inexpensive laptops). There won't be a lot of them in stock," Houlden warns.</p>

<p>If I stand up in church and invite the congregation to lunch, only to tell them an hour later that, "Oops, I don't have enough rice and peas, and only a quarter of the jerk chicken is available," I'd be acting like public health officials in this city, province and country.</p>
<p>They invited us to roll up our sleeves to get the swine flu H1N1 vaccine - even scolded those who balked. Just when we started believing that our health risked being compromised without getting the flu shot, they said, in effect, "Sorry, joking ... uh, come back next week, or maybe next month."</p>
<p>If, as health officials drum into us, "This year it's a different flu season," and the H1N1 virus is indeed a pandemic that threatens to kill us by the hundreds, if not thousands, then God help us.</p>
<p>Those charged with looking after the public's health have failed miserably - not the nurses who stick us with the needles, not the overmatched security people, not the staffers running off their feet to fix an ill-conceived health delivery system, but the people in charge.</p>
<p>It's as if we haven't learned anything from the SARS outbreak, where our political and medical leadership proved incapable of coordinated and timely direction in the face of a public health crisis.</p>
<p>What we do know is that full-page advertisements in the Star and other newspapers trumpet that the pandemic is coming. The World Health Organization declared H1N1 a pandemic in June. Health officials have been watching the onset of the outbreak for who knows how long. And this is how they tackle it once it arrives?</p>
<p>We are not talking about SARS - the outbreak that caught us napping and slammed residents and health workers with unexpected fury.</p>
<p>No, this was expected, trumpeted and prepared for. And now the plan seems hopelessly botched, an unacceptable public health performance in the face of a supposed deadly outbreak.</p>
<p>We practised on SARS and the Asian flu; by now we should have perfected the delivery of public health.</p>
<p>If the fallout from this debacle is mass deaths, at least future warnings from health officials might be heeded. Public confidence - at least in the medical knowledge of our health officials - will be restored. What would remain shaken to the core is faith in their ability to manage an outbreak and prepare for the worst.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the handling of the crisis feeds a gnawing suspicion that the entire outbreak is overstated and the danger is not nearly as real as some say. That view was gaining a foothold, until the tragic death of the 13-year-old Toronto hockey player struck fear in residents. Now, it's back in currency.</p>
<p>Yes, it makes sense that those most susceptible to the virus get the available shots first. But if we are all at risk, then the vaccines should be readily available to all.</p>
<p>In attempting to downplay the risk to the general public, health officials Friday said healthy residents should not panic if they have to wait a few weeks to get the vaccine. And even if they get sick during that time, it's unlikely they will be stricken by a severe illness instead of a mild version of H1N1.</p>
<p>All this does is feed the naysayers who have consistently maintained the danger is greatly overstated.</p>
<p>If the disease is so dangerous, Health Canada and the provinces would have made sure there was enough vaccine available for every man, woman and child in the nation.</p>
<p>They didn't.</p>
<p>This is either incalculable incompetence. Or health officials are so smart that they are holding back supplies of the vaccine to manage the madness and panic that might ensue.</p>
<p>Either way, this is no way to run a public health system.</p>

<p>Hundreds queue for shots,</p>
<p>Oct. 29</p>
<p>As a parent of young children I want to protect them from getting the H1N1 flu but am wary of an untested vaccine. It has been suggested numerous times that this vaccine has needed to be rushed through. This may be understandable but what is not is the Canadian government's refusal to offer a compensation fund for immunization injuries. The United States saw fit to do this in the '80s, but our politicians refuse to do so. I don't see what they should be scared of if, as they say, "the vaccines are completely safe."</p>

</p>
<p>Canada is in the midst of its largest-ever mass immunization campaign and, these days, people naturally turn to the Internet for information, or what passes for it.</p>
<p>They will learn a variety of things. For example:</p>
<p>That vaccines are flat-out dangerous because they're chock-full of toxins; mercury, formaldehyde, aluminium, and such like.</p>
<p>"When our leaders present us with experimental chemicals we must accept them unconditionally into our communal blood. If you refuse, you are not a moral person, and a dire threat to society." - comment to a Vancouver H1N1 blog.</p>
<p>Government intervention in public health equals a violation of individual rights and a step toward totalitarianism (more popular in the U.S.).</p>
<p>"If you refuse to get the H1N1 vaccine you will be put before a court of law and even vaccinated by gun point ... the WHO makes the law now." - blogger whose normal subject matter is UFOs. Mass inoculation is all about the drug companies making billions in profit and the H1N1 shot is a cash cow that's been fast-tracked by trigger-happy public health officials in league with the devil, a.k.a. Big Pharma.</p>
<p>"How much is Big Pharma paying the <span class="companylink">NY Times</span> to 'dispel myths' about a potentially dangerous and unnecessary vaccine? Why don't you spend precious space promoting ways to strengthen the immune system instead?" - comment to the New York Times.</p>
<p>Vaccines have been accused of causing everything from asthma to allergies, autoimmune disease to, most famous recently, autism - and that's just the list of "A"s.</p>
<p>No surprise then that polls this week showed fewer than half of Canadians intend to get the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>No matter how often it's explained that the benefits of vaccines far outweigh the risks, there is a chorus of disapprovers out there - fantasists, conspiratists, but also genuinely thoughtful critics - undermining the government message (which, in the case of H1N1, is rightfully accused of being confusing).</p>
<p>"People make up the facts," Dr. David Butler Jones, head of Canada's Public Health Agency, said last week. "The worst thing that could happen is people listen to these claims. I just saw somebody on the news this morning claiming neurological damage from vaccines. That is just plain not true, but it persists."</p>
<p>Ever thus. The anti-vaccine movement is neither new nor the result of the Internet's strong suit - spreading fiction as well as fact.</p>
<p>Condemnation started shortly after the first vaccine was developed in England - for smallpox, by Edward Jenner in 1798 - and made mandatory in 1853. Refusers could be jailed, a move that appalled many critics.</p>
<p>Religious objectors viewed it as injecting poison into the sacred temple of the body or "an attempt to swindle nature." "The activities of today's propagandists against immunization are directly descended, indeed little changed, from those of the anti-vaccinationists of the late 19th century," wrote Northwestern University public health professors Robert Wolfe and Lisa Sharpe in a 2002 article for the British Medical Journal.</p>
<p>Problem is, not all critics are equally easy to laugh off or dismiss.</p>
<p>Take epidemiologist Tom Jefferson, head of the Vaccines Field at the Cochrane Collaboration, a highly respected international network of researchers who appraise medical evidence by combing through hundreds of studies.</p>
<p>Jefferson is an outspoken critic of the evidence that purports to show that seasonal flu vaccines work. He says researchers have been fooled into thinking vaccines are more effective than the data suggest.</p>
<p>"Rubbish is not a scientific term, but I think it's the term that applies," he says in the current edition of The Atlantic.com.</p>
<p>Jefferson says that public health studies systematically overestimate the incidence of genuine flu and confuse it with ILI (influenza-like illness). Jefferson is skeptical that an actual H1N1 pandemic exists, speculating that it's like the much-vaunted bird-flu pandemic in 2005, which never transpired.</p>
<p>"Sometimes you get the feeling that there is a whole industry almost waiting for a pandemic to occur," he said this summer, especially now that the World Health Organization has changed its definition of pandemic.</p>
<p>"The old definition was a new virus, which went around quickly, for which you didn't have immunity, and which created a high morbidity and mortality rate. Now the last two have been dropped, and that's how swine flu has been categorized as a pandemic."</p>
<p>Jefferson's views have made him a pariah in some circles, but not in Edda West's.</p>
<p>She's the co-ordinator of the B.C.-based Vaccination Risk Awareness Network, an organization of 500 families across Canada who believe their children were adversely affected or injured by childhood vaccinations. West likens Jefferson to the boy who cried "the emperor has no clothes." Then again, the network's website refers to the H1N1 vaccine as a "public health experiment. "The government has created a fairy-land where you can't talk about the risks or side-effects of immunization without being called a looney," she says. "Vaccines should be brought off their holy pedestal."</p>
<p>It was West who led the successful 1984 fight in Ontario against compulsory MMR vaccination of children - a shot for measles, mumps and rubella - before they enter kindergarten. Parents can now claim a constitutional exemption on the basis of "freedom of conscience."</p>
<p>It seems redundant to ask, but no, West isn't getting the H1N1 jab. "I know too much," she says, citing Tom Jefferson's work.</p>
<p>The subject may bring the lunatic fringe out of the woodwork, but her network isn't part of it, West says. "We just believe that people should be given all the risk factors so they can give truly informed consent."</p>
<p>But with the H1N1 vaccine, they don't yet exist, counters University of Toronto epidemiologist Bart Harvey.</p>
<p>Yes, people should make a knowledgeable decision, "but they're looking for 100 per cent certain pronouncements about benefits and risks and we won't know what they are until we look back in retrospect."</p>
<p>While doubters have existed since the dawn of inoculation, what's new in the anti-immunization movement is the concept of "vaccine overload."</p>
<p>It began in 1998 when Britain went into a panic over the MMR vaccine following gastroenterologist Andrew Wakefield's claim that it caused autism. The alarm quickly spread around the world, although Wakefield's finding wasn't supported by subsequent, peer-reviewed (his was not) studies. Earlier this year, the London Sunday Times reported that he had manipulated patient data and misreported results.</p>
<p>But that came too late to alter what's become a firm conviction in the minds of many parents of autistic children.</p>
<p>Sick Children's Hospital Foundation took a whack of criticism this week for helping to fund an autism conference this weekend organized by two groups that claim childhood inoculations - "too many vaccines given too soon" - causes the condition.</p>
<p>While there is scientific evidence that in rare cases vaccines can cause severe adverse effects, the medical consensus says there is none whatsoever that they cause autism.</p>
<p>Sick Children's involvement likely added to the general confusion over H1N1 this week. Why would it get involved? "Keep your friends close and your enemies closer?" suggests Bart Harvey.</p>
<p>For the record: The H1N1 vaccine - named Arepanrix by manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> - doesn't contain a live virus but "antigens" that trick the immune system into thinking it's been attacked and help produce anti-bodies. It also contains two "adjuvants," agents that stimulate the immune system: vitamin E and the organic compound squalene from fish oil. Minute amounts of thimerisol, a mercury-containing preservative, and aluminium are in it too. Though its manufacture has been streamlined in Canada, the vaccine has triggered more than 90 per cent immunity in thousands of healthy Europeans who've already taken it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu-haunted St. George turns into ghost town</b>

<p>Tonight could be the spookiest Halloween in the 225-year history of St. George, N.B.</p>
<p>The spectre that stalks its tree-lined streets will keep teenagers indoors, set loose a flurry of small-town gossip and prompt the town to close public places.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, I'm worried about the whole thing,” said Lynn Farmakoulas, principal of Fundy High, the local secondary school. “I can see stores shutting down, restaurants closing.”</p>
<p>She should know.</p>
<p>That scourge – the H1N1 virus – prompted officials to close Fundy yesterday after a quarter of its teachers and half its students stayed home with the flu. Four other schools in the area were also closed. And now, on a weekend usually reserved for exchanges of sugar and fright, much of the region will hunker indoors until the virus passes.</p>
<p>“My son was told not to trick-or-treat by the doctor,” said April Lomax.</p>
<p>Her 14-year-old attends Fundy High. “It's shaping up to be a quiet Halloween.”</p>
<p>Like hundreds of others in the 1,300-person town, Ms. Lomax's son came down with the flu early this week. By Thursday, Fundy High was deserted, with 340 of 640 students absent.</p>
<p>Also among the missing were 11 of 42 teachers, two of six custodians, four bus drivers and half the teaching assistants.</p>
<p>“If we had been open today, we would have had to double and triple class sizes,” Ms. Farmakoulas said. “It wasn't something we had ever planned for. We discussed what would happen if staff presented as ill, but we never went further and asked what would happen if a quarter of the staff was out.”</p>
<p>The breadth of the infection prompted the closing of the local arena this weekend, and residents adopted a new suspicion of one another.</p>
<p>“I didn't want anyone here to know about my son,” Ms. Lomax said.</p>
<p>“They act like it's the plague.”</p>
<p>Fundy High is expected to reopen on Wednesday, unless more staff fall ill over the weekend.</p>
<p>The story was similar on the opposite coast. In the remote town of Kitimat, B.C., school officials closed Mount Elizabeth Secondary School when the absentee rate reached 40 per cent on Thursday.</p>
<p>“What we're trying to do is interrupt the cycle of transmission,” said Rob Greenwood, superintendent of Coast Mountains School District.</p>
<p>“We have asked staff and students to self-isolate, to stay away from malls and places like that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Greenwood said the closing was unprecedented.</p>
<p>“We've closed schools due to snow, yes, but not flu. I don't recall seeing absenteeism at this rate ever in my career.”</p>
<p>During the earlier flu outbreak this spring, a number of schools across the country closed, a precautionary measure that was later labelled excessive in light of the mild nature of the virus.</p>
<p>Several provincial chief medical health officers, along with the World Health Organization, have been critical of closings as a flu-fighting measure.</p>
<p>But in St. George, the five affected schools simply couldn't open their doors with so many sick staff, Ms. Farmakoulas said.</p>
<p>And the same may go for the rest of the country in coming weeks.</p>
<p>“The school is a mirror of the wider community,” she said. “If it's impacting us this way, what happens when it spreads through government and businesses? It's a bit scary, really.”</p>

<p>Bottles of hand sanitizers are flying off store shelves amid the H1N1 influenza outbreak, with manufacturers ramping up production to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>Anxious consumers are pushing up retail sales, while Canadian offices and factories are distributing sanitizers to employees, quickly reducing supplies of certain brands in some regions.</p>
<p>One Shoppers Drug Mart in Toronto, for instance, ran out of its Life brand with the plastic pump yesterday, but still had squeeze bottles of Purell.</p>
<p>Purell manufacturer <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span> said the resurgence of H1N1 has prompted consumers to clamour for its product. “Our top priority is public health and we are committed to working with our suppliers to attempt to increase production” to ensure “sufficient quantities are available to meet consumer demand during the remainder of 2009 and in 2010,” a <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span> spokesman said.</p>
<p>While U.S.-based manufacturers declined yesterday to disclose data for their products in Canada, market-research firm Nielsen said sales of hand sanitizers in the U.S. surged to $118.4-million (U.S.) for the 24 weeks ending Oct. 3, up 70 per cent from the same period last year.</p>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- Several members of the Olympic 2010 torch-relay team received their H1N1 shots earlier this week, ahead of pregnant women, health-care workers, children and others in high-risk groups, a spokesman for the B.C. Centre for Disease Control confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p>However, Canadian athletes who tried to move to the front of the line were turned down. “We were very clear with [the athletes],” Bonnie Henry, director of public health emergency management at the centre, said in an interview. “They don't jump the queue.”</p>
<p>The athletes could not justify the urgency based on the health risk, she said. “It was more, the competition is starting, so they wanted to have the vaccination to protect them before it starts,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Henry spoke about the special arrangements for torch-relay staff, which does not include torchbearers, shortly after Monika Naus, medical director of immunization programs at the B.C. centre, told reporters the province received significantly less vaccine than initially anticipated this week. Many British Columbians will not have the option of immunization until December, weeks after the peak of the pandemic has passed.</p>
<p>B.C. has so far received about 500,000 doses of adjuvanted vaccine, and another 350,000 doses will be distributed next week. The province expects to receive about four million doses by the end of the year, enough for everyone who wants it. Dr. Naus said immunization after the peak would still be worthwhile. The vaccine would provide protection while the H1N1 virus continues to circulate this winter and would continue to boost immunity next year.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, several people were turned away from a B.C. flu-shot clinic after the vaccine supply ran out. However, the lineups have been shorter in the past few days, although many were still required to wait several hours.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Island Health Authority provided 300 doses of H1N1 vaccine for Olympic torch-relay team members. The vaccine was set aside for the staff earlier this week, before the federal government announced the supply shortage.</p>
<p>Richard Stanwick, chief medical health officer for the authority, said the flu shots were provided mostly to protect rural and remote communities along the torch-relay route. Protection of the staff members was a secondary benefit.</p>
<p>In some instances, the torch relay may arrive at isolated communities before the H1N1 vaccine is shipped to them, he said. “At least this is going to afford some protection [and ensure] that all we end up doing is passing on the Olympic spirit and nothing else,” Dr. Stanwick said.</p>
<p>The Canadian Olympic Committee did not respond to a request for an interview yesterday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Breast-cancer patients get $17.5-million settlement; Victims of Newfoundland and Labrador's botched breast-cancer testing scandal reach deal over errors</b>
</div><div>ANDRÉ PICARD   </div>
<div>563 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>Breast-cancer patients in Newfoundland and Labrador who were treated inadequately due to botched tests by a provincial lab have settled their class-action lawsuit for $17.5-million.</p>
<p>The mediated settlement with Eastern Health also includes a promise that victims will be given a seat on the committee that will oversee implementation of recommendations from a public inquiry into the debacle, the construction of a memorial and a public apology.</p>
<p>The apology came quickly from Vickie Kaminski, CEO of the Eastern Regional Integrated Health Authority.</p>
<p>“The class members are sincere, honest people who have been wronged and harmed, and this settlement is meant as a sincere apology to them,” she said in an interview.</p>
<p>Ms. Kaminski stressed, however, that “no amount of money can adequately compensate people who have experienced this kind of error in their medical treatment.”</p>
<p>Rosalind Jardine, a member of the negotiating team, and one of hundreds of women who received inaccurate results from hormone-receptor tests used to determine the most appropriate course of treatment, said class members wanted a resolution of the lawsuit that demonstrated “sincerity and respect … and this settlement does that.”</p>
<p>The deal was reached during three days of mediation overseen by George Adams, a former Ontario Superior Court judge. The settlement still has to be approved by the Supreme Court of Newfoundland and Labrador and, until then, none of the parties would discuss how the money will be distributed to individuals. Nor would they discuss how much of the settlement will be paid by Eastern Health and how much will fall on its insurer, <span class="companylink">Healthcare Insurance Reciprocal of Canada</span>.</p>
<p>The lawsuit was launched in 2006 by lawyer Ches Crosbie after it was revealed that mistakes were detected on the hormone-receptor tests. Patients diagnosed with breast cancer undergo estrogen- and progesterone-receptor tests to determine if these hormones are fuelling tumour growth. If so, drugs like Tamoxifen and Anastrozole can be given to block these hormones.</p>
<p>At least 425 patients received incorrect test results between 1997 and 2005 and, as a result, they did not received optimal treatment. In some cases, the incorrect tests resulted in chemotherapy and surgery that was not required.</p>
<p>In 2007, after a public outcry, an inquiry was launched, led by provincial Supreme Court Justice Margaret Cameron.</p>
<p>Her damning report concluded that quality control at the Eastern Health lab that conducted the tests was virtually non-existent and that there was a lack of accountability and oversight at all levels of the provincial health system that contributed to the disaster.</p>
<p>Verna Doucette of Port au Port was the representative plaintiff in the lawsuit. She was diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in March of 2002, and both her estrogen- and progesterone-receptor tests came back negative. As a result, she underwent chemotherapy, which activated an old tuberculosis infection that resulted in the removal of a lung.</p>
<p>But in 2006, retesting showed that Ms. Doucette's hormone-receptor tests were actually positive and she should have been treated with the drug Tamoxifen, not chemotherapy.</p>
<p>The final indignity for Ms. Doucette was that she was unable to participate in the mediation talks because she contracted H1N1 flu and was too sick to attend.</p>

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- Montrealers are talking about washing up and using sanitizers these days – but not to fight the H1N1 virus. They're searching for the best leader to clean the dirt at city hall.</p>
<p>And on the eve of Montreal's municipal election, the race for mayor has become a toss-up.</p>
<p>A mud-hurling campaign appears to have hurt both Mayor Gérald Tremblay and his principal rival, long-time Péquiste Louise Harel. Both have seen their support erode in favour of third-party candidate Richard Bergeron, a new poll suggests.</p>
<p>The survey suggests the three candidates are so close, any of them could end up becoming mayor tomorrow.</p>
<p>“It's essentially a statistical tie,” said Jaideep Mukerji, a vice-president of public affairs at Angus Reid, which conducted the poll published yesterday in La Presse.</p>
<p>The candidates have been hobbled by their own distinctive baggage. Mr. Tremblay has been beset by nearly daily allegations of corruption and collusion between construction firms and city hall. Ms. Harel's life-long association with the sovereigntist movement and her poor command of English have alienated most non-francophone voters.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Bergeron, an urban planner and city councillor, has watched his support grow, surveys show. He has raised eyebrows with some of his theories about smoking and 9/11 conspiracies involving the White House, but his proposals for public transit and fighting urban sprawl appear to have caught on, especially among younger voters, Mr. Mukerji said.</p>
<p>“He's a bit of a protest vote,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, many Montrealers have found all three candidates unpalatable for different reasons. La Presse took the unusual step of not endorsing anyone. “Faced with the weaknesses demonstrated by each of the mayoral candidates, La Presse is not able to support one or the other,” lead editorial writer André Pratte wrote this week.</p>
<p>Yet Montrealers weren't asking for the stars when the campaign started – just someone who'd fix the potholes and keep the city running, observers say. Marcel Côté, a prominent Montreal economist heading a task force on municipal governance, says all Montrealers are looking for is a leader “who gets the trains running on time.</p>
<p>“Let's take care of day-to-day operations of the city. The population is fed up,” Mr. Côté said. “We need good stewardship and we don't have it.”</p>
<p>Whoever takes the reins faces the giant task of restoring public confidence. Concerns over corruption trumped Montrealers' perennial beefs about crumbling infrastructure as their top priority, the survey found.</p>
<p>“It's sort of a poisoned chalice because they're going to deal with an electorate with a very cynical view toward the municipal administration,” Mr. Mukerji said.</p>
<p>With the ethical cloud over the city, Premier Jean Charest is likely to continue facing pressure to call a public inquiry into alleged mob influence in the construction industry and ties to city hall.</p>
<p>“If we've had such a corrupt, damaged system for so many years, it can't be ignored,” said Harold Chorney, a political economist at Concordia University in Montreal. “We have to really clean house, ventilate the place, and let the light in.”</p>
<p>But he couldn't predict who'll be doing the cleanup. “It's a real horse race.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Weeding out the queue</b>

<p>For months Canadians have been urged to get vaccinated against H1N1. All the messaging from health authorities at three levels of government has been to insist that people be immunized. Not just high-risk people, but all people. Canada was weeks behind other countries in rolling out the vaccine in the first place, so there was palpable relief when clinics finally began to open, and people – not only high-risk ones – did as they were told and went to get their shots.</p>
<p>The fact, then, that Ontario announced on Friday it was abruptly suspending vaccinations for the general public amid supply problems, and the likelihood that other provinces will follow suit, pushes the H1N1 immunization campaign toward fiasco.</p>
<p>The definition of who would be designated as high-risk was carefully, even ponderously, studied by Canadian authorities. Indeed, it took Canada several months longer than other countries to come up with its definitions of “high-risk”; urgency has never characterized Canada's own pandemic response, despite its public messaging.</p>
<p>But one would have hoped that such a methodical approach would beget a logical vaccine rollout, one that would have, yes, placed high-risk individuals, pregnant women, aboriginals, children under five, people with chronic lung issues, at the head of the queue. But that didn't happen.</p>
<p>In many jurisdictions, health authorities quickly started to provide the vaccine to the general public. Only when supplies evaporated amid apparently – and inexplicably – unanticipated high demand, was a ban placed on the general public receiving the vaccine.</p>
<p>Now, people waiting in queues will be questioned about why they are there – their likely response being that the health authorities have for months urged them to be there and indeed initially opened clinics to all. If they don't fall into one of the risk groups, they will be weeded out. The Public Health Agency of Canada, and other health authorities, along with their political masters, should not be surprised by the resulting public fury.</p>
<p>The fact is that while H1N1 poses a particular threat to high-risk groups, it also threatens people who are not among those groups, such as 13-year-old hockey players. Healthy young adults have ended up on respirators for weeks, and in some cases have died. So, all that can be said is that the effects of H1N1 are usually fairly mild – except in those rare cases where it is severe.</p>
<p>It is hardly surprising that a large number of people outside the high-risk groups have opted not to take the chance and are demanding the vaccine. At the end of the day, everybody is at some risk from H1N1. The question is how long the general public will now have to shoulder that risk.</p>

</div><div>Jerrad Peters / Kickabout   </div>

</p>
<p>David Beckham will play a Major League Soccer playoff match on Sunday. It will be his first in three seasons with Los Angeles Galaxy, and his side will be expected to beat local rivals Chivas USA over the two legs. In an unexpected twist to an otherwise disastrous script, Beckham may exit North American soccer as an MLS Cup champion.</p>
<p>Of course, that was always the plan. When he inked a five-year, US$250 million contract with the Galaxy and MLS in early 2007, he was not only expected to be an unprecedented commercial success, he was supposed to take the league's most glamorous franchise to the top of the heap. Only one of those things happened, at least in the first two seasons.</p>
<p>Ironically, his on-field success came in his third go-around, after he returned from a controversial winter loan at AC Milan. After being branded a "traitor" and "part-timer" by some of Galaxy's hardcore supporters -- not to mention a call-out by club captain Landon Donovan in Grant Wahl's book, The Beckham Experiment -- he got down to business and took the team on a 7-3-3 run down the stretch en route to a second-place finish.</p>
<p>As a result, Galaxy are about to make their first playoff appearance since they last won the title in 2005. And if they can get past Chivas, they'll line up against the winner of the Seattle Sounders-Houston Dynamo series in the Western Conference Final -- the last hurdle before the MLS Cup showpiece match on November 22.</p>
<p>They just might get that far. But whether they do or don't, this much is certain: Beckham will not be a Galaxy player on November 23. He has already agreed to a second loan spell with Milan, and he will probably take advantage of an opt-out clause in his contract to secure a permanent move to Europe in January.</p>
<p>That won't go over well with Galaxy fans, or the MLS establishment in general. But he's earned them a lot of money. And, as unlikely as it once seemed, he might just go out a winner.</p>
<p>English Premier League</p>
<p>The North London derby would have made for much better watching if it had been played in September. Back then, Arsenal were swatting opponents aside like flies and Tottenham Hotspur were in the midst of a five-match winning streak that included an opening-day victory against Liverpool. The top of the league might have been at stake.</p>
<p>These days, Arsenal have fallen slightly closer to earth. They played to a lazy 2-2 draw at West Ham last weekend -- a result preceded by a 1-1 draw against AZ Alkmaar in the Champions League. Spurs, meanwhile, have had to come from behind to draw the Bolton Wanderers and were dealt an embarrassing 1-0 loss at home to Stoke a week ago.</p>
<p>Their plight will not be helped by the absence of Jermaine Defoe, who is suspended for today's match. Aaron Lennon and Luka Modric will also miss the derby, while Tomas Rosicky and Theo Walcott -- both with knee injuries -- will not be a part of Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's squad.</p>
<p>Although both sides have 19 points and are joint-third in the standings, Arsenal have a game in hand and can pull level with second-place Manchester United if they win. Spurs will be trying to hold off fifth-place Liverpool, who have a tricky assignment at Craven Cottage later today.</p>

<p>In September, Pepe Ruz -- a Spanish warlock -- claimed to have cast a spell on Cristiano Ronaldo, saying, "He will be injured for more time than he plays." Ronaldo suffered an ankle injury in his next match and hasn't played since. Make of it what you will.</p>
<p>Blackburn Rovers have been hit by H1N1. Striker Jason Roberts contracted the virus late this week and will not be at Old Trafford for today's match against Manchester United. Midfielder David Dunn has recovered from the illness.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>third drunk driving conviction Wayway chief spared jail time to attend to band's H1N1 needs -</b>
</div><div>By Mike McIntyre   </div>
<div>593 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>The chief of a Manitoba First Nation has avoided a jail sentence for his third drunk driving conviction because of his community's battle with the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Murray Clearsky, 53, was given a month-long conditional sentence this week, which allows him to remain free in the community of Waywayseecappo, located about 300 kilometres northwest of Winnipeg. Crown and defence lawyers cited "special circumstances" in not seeking custody for Clearsky.</p>
<p>"We've crafted a sentence that will allow him to attend to the band and their needs during this H1N1 epidemic," said Crown attorney Shaun Sass. "Given these special circumstances, it's not contrary to the public interest to let him serve his sentence in the community."</p>
<p>The Crown had originally planned to seek between 14 and 30 days behind bars. Defence lawyer Jay Prober told court Clearsky has a vital public role to serve, which would be severely impacted if he were locked up at this critical time.</p>
<p>Clearsky was charged in December 2007 after his erratic driving caught the eye of RCMP officers doing a highway checkstop in western Manitoba. Clearsky nearly crashed into a vehicle and almost drove into the ditch while fishtailing down the highway, court was told.</p>
<p>Police immediately recognized him and caught a strong smell of alcohol from inside the car. Clearsky's speech was slurred and his face flushed. He was verbally combative with police and had to be restrained and lodged in the holding cells for several hours until he could sober up.</p>
<p>Blood-alcohol tests revealed he was double the legal limit at the time of his arrest.</p>
<p>"He realizes he made a mistake. He was lucky there were no accidents or injuries," said Prober.</p>
<p>Clearsky is the father of three young children, has a Grade 8 education and has been chief at Waywayseecappo since 1986, his lawyer said.</p>
<p>He was convicted in 1983 of refusing a breath sample and given a fine. Clearsky was convicted of the same charge in July 2004 and given a $1,380 fine and year-long driving prohibition. He also has a previous conviction for possession of a dangerous weapon from 1987.</p>
<p>"I know I should have learned from the past. I apologize for what happened," Clearsky told court during his sentencing hearing. "I know it happened quite a while back. I've done a lot of thinking since."</p>
<p>Clearsky said he had been at a Christmas party in a neighbouring community and was "stranded" when his driver left early. He has been attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings on the reserve since his arrest.</p>
<p>"I try to do the best I can on behalf of my people. They have a lot of trust in me," he said. "Nobody's perfect. But still, this shouldn't have happened."</p>
<p>Provincial court Judge Lee Ann Martin said Clearsky had failed his community.</p>
<p>"With your role as a chief of the band, the words that come to mind are 'Shame on you,'" said Martin. "You're in a position where people look up to you. People expect you to do better. When you're out in public you need to be stronger. You are the one who needs to be setting the example."</p>
<p>Clearsky must be in his home under a curfew at all times, expect when he needs to attend to reserve business. He must also abstain from alcohol and is banned from driving for the next year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Show of spirit - Manito Ahbee Festival explores traditional and contemporary sides of aboriginal arts and culture</b>
</div><div>By Rob Williams   </div>
<div>1286 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>C1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>No lie, Tracy Bone has one of the busiest weeks of her life coming up.</p>
<p>It's time for the fourth annual Manito Ahbee Festival, and with about 25,000 people expected to take part in the five-day event the Winnipeg singer-songwriter is performing nightly Tuesday through Saturday.</p>
<p>"When you're independent, you're depending on yourself," says Bone, 33, who is up for entertainer and songwriter of the year at Friday's Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards. "It's a lot of work, but it's a lot of fun."</p>
<p>That her 2008 Juno-nominated release No Lies is also a finalist for pop album of the year is a surprise, since Bone's CD is rooted in country with pop and rock edges. It highlights her diverse musical style, which will be on display throughout Aboriginal Music Week, Nov. 3-7.</p>
<p>Think aboriginal music is all about drumming? Think again. There is traditional music on tap, but the lineup of musical acts ranges from hip-hop to blues and everything in between.</p>
<p>"People ask me if aboriginal music is a genre," Bone says. "Festival people can see it for themselves and come up with their own idea of what it is."</p>
<p>She is performing at three official events and is hosting her own music showcase called All My Relations with several APCMA nominees at the Regal Beagle Pub Thursday and Friday at 9 p.m.</p>
<p>"Everyone we meet, aboriginal or not, they become our cousins," she says. "It's a big family."</p>
<p>The number of Bone's extended relatives is about to grow by leaps and bounds over the next week during Manito Ahbee Festival, the annual celebration of aboriginal culture running Nov. 4-8.</p>
<p>The festival experimented with a 10-day program for the last two years but went back to a five-day run this year because it was too hard for people to attend everything over the course of two weekends, says Manito Ahbee general manager Gloria Spence.</p>
<p>"We wanted to have more going on in less days," she said. "That way our visitors from out of town could hit every event."</p>
<p>Last year the festival -- named for a site in the Whiteshell where petroforms depict the teaching of aboriginal elders -- attracted 25,000 visitors and participants to its various events, an increase from 20,000 in 2007 when an ice storm kept away 200 powwow competitors.</p>
<p>Barring any weather disasters, organizers hope the number of dancers, drummers and singers from across North America will top 800.</p>
<p>Spence doesn't believe the H1N1 scare will affect the turnout. In case people are worried, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority is on board to ensure hand sanitizers are at the MTS Centre, the Winnipeg Convention Centre and McPhillips Street <span class="companylink">Station Casino</span>, alongside information about preventative measures people can take to avoid contracting the virus.</p>
<p>"There will be a real message out about it, and our education conference this year is going to have a herbalist present who is going to be talking about the traditional vaccine for H1N1," Spence said.</p>
<p>The education conference for junior high and high school students is one of the major components of Manito Ahbee, along with the APCMAs, the music festival and an international powwow competition and trade show with artisans selling traditional crafts.</p>
<p>Manito Ahbee is shorter, but the musical festival has expanded from three to five days and become Aboriginal Music Week, which kicks off Tuesday.</p>
<p>The growth of the music festival corresponds to an increase in voting for the APCMAs, whose winners are selected during two rounds of public online voting. This year 34,978 ballots were cast from around the world for artists in 27 different categories.</p>
<p>The awards will be handed out over three nights, but the big show is Friday, when actor Lorne Cardinal hosts the nationally televised awards show at the MTS Centre, with performances by Buffy Sainte-Marie, Digging Roots, George Canyon and Charlie Major, among others.</p>
<p>Bone will perform twice on the show: once with her band and once with Crystal Shawanda, singing Darling Don't Cry in a tribute to Sainte-Maire.</p>
<p>Organizers hope the array of talent will encourage more non-aboriginal people to take in some of Manito Ahbee, subtitled A Festival for All Nations.</p>
<p>"We want people to come out and participate and learn about our culture through music, song and dance," said Derek McCorrister, APCMA manager of operations. "It's one type of education. It's a learning tool. This festival is a showcase of art and culture and we hope through that, people walk away learning something about our culture."</p>
<p>Manito Ahbee officially kicks off Wednesday with a fundraising gala at the Fairmont Hotel and runs through Sunday. Aboriginal Music Week starts Tuesday.</p>
<p>rob.williams@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Ohshkii: Gala Evening</p>
<p>Wednesday, Fairmont Hotel, 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>The Manito Ahbee kickoff fundraising gala includes a multi-course dinner, a silent auction, live entertainment by Vancouver rock band Bitterly Divine and the handing out of four Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards.</p>
<p>Education Conference</p>
<p>Wednesday to Friday, Winnipeg Convention Centre</p>
<p>Hundreds of grades 7-12 students will learn about aboriginal culture and heritage at various interactive sessions focused on traditional teachings, music, dance and storytelling, all united by the theme Saving Our Mother Earth.</p>
<p>Aboriginal Peoples Choice Music Awards First Night</p>

</p>
<p>Never mind the haunted houses this Halloween. Nearly one in five – 18 per cent – of U.S. employees describe their workplace as scary, according to a survey by online job site Careerbuilder.com.</p>
<p>Among what makes them spooked: 18 per cent cited their workload, 9 per cent each reported performance reviews and tight deadlines, 8 per cent shuddered at the hours worked, 7 per cent shivered because of their boss and 6 per cent feared sitting through meetings, according to the survey of 4, 285 U.S. workers.</p>
<p>Staff</p>
<p>In upcoming salary wars,</p>
<p>some professions sit pretty</p>
<p>Most starting salaries will remain flat or even fall next year, but a few professions should see competitive bidding for talent, according to a U.S. salary outlook from staffing service <span class="companylink">Robert Half International</span>. They include: senior financial analysts, credit managers, network engineers, business systems analysts and executive assistants.</p>
<p>Staff</p>
<p>Workers key on health</p>
<p>due to H1N1 concerns</p>
<p>Seventy-one per cent of workers say they have become more careful about protecting their health this year because of H1N1 fears, according to a survey by employee assistance provider <span class="companylink">ComPsych Corp</span>.</p>
<p>Among their main moves: 47 per cent said they are more likely to wash their hands and avoid touching other people or workplace surfaces. Sixteen per cent said they are more inclined to get a flu shot, and 8 per cent said they're more likely to stay home or keep family members at home with flu symptoms, the survey found.</p>
<p>Staff Company ethics trump</p>
<p>salary for many workers</p>
<p>More than half of Canadians would be willing to accept a pay cut or a lesser job title in order to work for an organization with a sound corporate reputation, a poll by staffing company <span class="companylink">Kelly Services</span> has found.</p>
<p>A company's ethical behaviour was cited as an important factor in deciding where to work by 97 per cent of 7,000 surveyed, with 53 per cent saying they would take a pay cut to work for an employer with a reputation for caring about employees and the community.</p>
<p>And 91 per cent said they would consider an employer's efforts to reduce global warming when choosing a career. The percentages were nearly identical in workers in all age groups.</p>
<p>The findings indicate that “employees take pride not only in what they do while at work, but in what their organization stands for and how it is perceived by the entire community,” says Kelly vice-president and Canadian managing director Karin French.</p>

<div>Globe Style</div>
<div id="hd"><b>If you cut out cheek kisses, flu season wins</b>
</div><div>RUSSELL SMITH   </div>
<div>570 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L2</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>style@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Dear Mr. Smith: In a time of swine flu, is it really rude to avoid shaking hands with people you meet? How about suggesting a fist bump, the way celebrities with OCD are allowed to do? And what about French-style cheek-kissing? Shouldn't it be deplored?</p>
<p>In other words, does a hysterical fear of disease give us licence to be rude? Do we really want to behave like people with the (really serious and not at all funny) obsessive-compulsive tendency? That's like suggesting it would be cool to become bipolar.</p>
<p>Listen, it has always been dangerous to shake hands with people. You have always had to wash your hands after a social event to avoid everything from colds to warts. But showing a vulnerability is the whole point of the custom: It originated in showing that one had relinquished one's weapon. Flesh-to-flesh contact is a sign of trust. It's probably even more important in a time of fear. If we all became cold and reserved in response to a disease, we would all, in a sense, have caught it.</p>
<p>Cheek-kissing is a more troublesome custom, if only for social reasons. It is practised in some places and not in others; the number of kisses varies; the people you are supposed to kiss are not at all clear.</p>
<p>Here are some guidelines: In Canada, both French and English, the number of kisses is two, one on each cheek. You do not have to actually kiss any flesh, just touch cheeks. In English Canada, kissing as a greeting is practised only in the large cities. Don't try it in small towns or the country. Wherever you are, it is only for friends – that is, for people you already know well. You do not kiss people on first meeting them. You do not kiss your professional contacts. It is unadvisable to kiss the people you work with.</p>
<p>If you have worked with people for years, of course, you end up becoming friends with them and, after a few after-work drinks, the kissing starts and then it muddies the waters, as you are kissing some colleagues and not others. I do not have any solution to this; I kiss some of my bosses and not others. (And yes, a few gay guys also air-kiss men in Toronto and Montreal, so I sometimes kiss guys as well.) The only useful rule here is: If you are at all unsure about whether to kiss, don't. Just stick out your hand instead. (And then wash up carefully before dinner, maybe adding a blob of sanitizer, which you of course carry in your briefcase or bag.) You may resist social pressure to kiss too if you don't feel like it or if there is a creepy guy who may be into it for more than social reasons.</p>
<p>But these are all social issues, not medical ones. Am I going to give up the pretty and sexy and basically joyous practice of kissing my friends because I'm afraid of getting the flu? If I did, I might as well stay home and watch TV.</p>

<div>ANXIETY AND CONTAGION</div>
<div>Comment</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Fear's old struggle with vaccination; The alarm over H1N1 pales beside the battles over smallpox – especially in 19th-century Montreal</b>
</div><div>MICHAEL BLISS   </div>
<div>1517 words</div><div>31 October 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A25</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Public health is often a battleground. Historically, debates about how to fight contagious disease were more clearly focused when the contagious diseases in question were seriously life-threatening. This year's alarm about the menace of the H1N1 virus is proving particularly problematic, for reasons ranging from the anxieties of anti-vaccinationists to the indifference of those who cannot see why they should panic about a relatively insignificant threat.</p>
<p>The practice of vaccination began in Britain in the 1790s when Dr. Edward Jenner observed that inoculation with cowpox virus (variolae vaccinae) created immunity to the smallpox virus, one of the scourges of humanity. For many centuries, smallpox had ravaged populations, killing about 20 per cent of its victims, and leaving many more blind and disfigured. Vaccination was instantly hailed as a great medical breakthrough, was very widely adopted and quickly began to reduce the carnage of smallpox.</p>
<p>From the beginning, however, skeptics attacked vaccination as potentially harmful, oversold, unnecessary and aimed at lining vaccinators' pockets. The idea of ingesting a sometimes toxic foreign substance was not intuitively acceptable to many people. They had to learn to weigh their natural fear of vaccination against the greater threat of smallpox. In the 19th century, vaccinophobia had to be overcome by extensive campaigns of public education, persuasion, hectoring and, as a last resort, compulsion. It was a long uphill struggle, and not without terrible setbacks.</p>
<p>In 1885, public-health officials in Montreal, then Canada's largest city, tried to stop a small outbreak of smallpox by offering extensive public vaccination. There was a tradition of suspicion about vaccination in Quebec, a tendency to take smallpox for granted as one of the many diseases sent by God to punish sinners. When the first vaccines used in Montreal turned out to be contaminated, causing cases of erysipelas, fear of the vaccine became greater than fear of smallpox. With vaccination suspended or resisted, the virus spread like wildfire among unvaccinated French-Canadian children, and within a few months caused more than 3,000 of them to die horribly, unnecessarily. Enlightened – and vaccinated – observers were appalled that fear, ignorance and fatalism had combined to trump common sense and good medical judgment. There had been rioting in Montreal's streets when the Board of Health tried to make vaccination compulsory.</p>
<p>After this disaster, the last major epidemic of smallpox in a major city, serious enforcement of compulsory vaccination, supported by such contagion-control measures as closing of schools and churches, became common resorts in the 20th century's mopping up of smallpox in every advanced country (though the phrase “conscientious objector” was coined in England to describe certain anti-vaccinationists). That campaign ended triumphantly in the 1970s, when smallpox disappeared. The last Canadian case was in 1962, the last case anywhere in the world was in Somalia in 1977.</p>
<p>If smallpox were to appear in any country today, there would be immediate resort to widespread and compulsory vaccination, along with compulsory enforcement of isolation and quarantine. Similarly draconian measures were surely being contemplated by public-health officials in Canada in 2003, when it briefly seemed that the powerful SARS virus had the potential to rage out of control.</p>
<p>THE DEFEAT OF SCOURGES</p>
<p>Louis Pasteur called his procedure to immunize against rabies “vaccination” in homage to Jenner, and the term now is used to cover most immunization processes. Over time, researchers developed vaccines against other horrible scourges – the defeat of polio by the Salk and Sabine vaccines since the 1950s has been particularly notable – and even against diseases that had previously been considered mild rites of childhood, including measles, mumps and chicken pox. In the last few years, vaccines have become increasingly the weapons of choice against the constantly mutating influenza virus. Some influenza strains are more dangerous than others. In 1918 there was no vaccine to protect against a particularly serious form of the virus, and it killed tens of millions. Helpless populations could only try to reduce contagion by wearing masks and staying away from possible contacts.</p>
<p>Even as vaccination has become more widely prescribed, safer and generally accepted, anti-vaccinationism has persisted as a minor but tenacious challenge to the medical consensus. As well, the fear-risk-benefit calculations we have to make in getting vaccinated change slightly with each disease. Few sensible people would not accept vaccination against smallpox, if it became necessary, or against polio. There has been significant resistance to measles vaccine (Quebec is still the centre of Canadian anti-vaccination sentiments), considerable indifference to vaccination against chicken pox, a raging debate about vaccinating girls for human papilloma virus, and fairly tepid compliance with recommendations for annual vaccination against the prevalent strain of influenza.</p>
<p>As the diseases we vaccinate against become less menacing, many citizens who have no hang-ups about vaccination per se just can't be bothered with the minor irritation and inconvenience. On the other hand, many people in modern societies are willing to go to considerable lengths to try to protect themselves against fairly unlikely contingencies. In the age of seat belts and airbags and children's car seats and helmets and life jackets, we no longer accept the levels of risk our parents took for granted.</p>
<p>Thus the stage was set for this year's public-health paradox: that the surprise appearance of an unusually mild strain of influenza is causing a state of immoderate alarm that is hugely disproportionate by past standards. To some extent it's been stirred up by journalists and public-health officials predisposed to attracting attention by trading in worst-case scenarios. More charitably, it has proved extremely difficult to strike a balance in explaining the threats posed by a new strain of virus and the strains that even a small proportion of severe cases might cause for an already over-burdened health-care system. “It's a very serious situation … but there's no need for alarm.” we are told. “If you aren't vaccinated you're not at serious risk … but it's socially irresponsible not to get vaccinated.” The subtleties get lost in the verbal shuffling.</p>
<p>Even in the old days of great crusades against terrible diseases, public-health officers could not take their authority for granted. In free societies, people make up their own minds, even on medical subjects. Conscientious objection is always an option. And when experts appear to be wrong or even confused in risk-assessment, especially if they're found to have been wrongly crying wolf, they can unintentionally undermine public confidence. Sometimes I think that our public-health experts could benefit from some of the more intelligent advice prescribed by professional media spin doctors.</p>
<p>THE THREE CAMPS</p>
<p>You would not know it from our public discourse, but Canadians, like the people of most prosperous countries, are among the healthiest humans in all of history. We live longer, our bodies are stronger, our physical capacities are greater than those of any peoples who came before us. Modern affluence, modern nutrition and modern medicine – including the vaccines that have been so effective in protecting us from the really dreaded diseases – have done wonderful things for us. No wonder most of us are glad to live at this time in history, rather than in any era of the plague-ridden past.</p>
<p>When it comes to thinking about our health, we seem to divide into three camps. At one extreme are the fearful, those predisposed to see health as infinitely fragile and constantly menaced by terrible threats – killer viruses in the eyes of some, killer vaccines in the view of others. It's the anxious and the obsessive who are the loudest voices in the media, clog clinics and hospitals, fulminate against demonic vaccinators and incompetent doctors, and try to weave suffocating protective cocoons around themselves and their families.</p>
<p>At the other extreme are the indifferent and irresponsible, who take their good health, their apparent immunity to disease and disease-talk for granted, and just tune out. We're all right, Jack. Not our problem. Cough, cough.</p>
<p>Most Canadians probably fall into a middle group. They're sensible people who don't like being sick, care for each other and take reasonable precautions to protect themselves and others. They have a sense of their good fortune in living in the 21st century and a sense of proportion about their priorities. When our health is at risk, we pay attention to our doctors and take our medicines and our vaccines. Then we get on with the important things of life, which centuries of progress and dedicated public health professionals have made it possible for us to enjoy. We go to concerts and movies and schools and churches and Tim's and we shake hands and kiss and hug one another without giving disease a second thought.</p>
<p>Life's too short to be spent thinking about sickness.</p>

</p>
<p>It was a strange day for the Saskatchewan Party government Thursday when the best thing that happened to it was an MLA getting assaulted.</p>
<p>Amidst stories of prisoners released early and mixed messages about sending surgical patients to British Columbia, Lyle Stewart fighting off and subduing a would-be carjacker was the talk of the province</p>
<p>Stewart -- a little shook up but still displaying his dry-as-a-bone sense of humour -- had reporters agape, and laughing, as he recounted the set-to in defence of his 2001 Ford Taurus.</p>
<p>"It's not that great a car, really," he said ruefully.</p>
<p>One reporter asked if Stewart had told the assailant he was an MLA.</p>
<p>"No, I didn't play that card," he deadpanned.</p>
<p>Stewart had managed to phone police on his cellphone while pinning down the assailant under the dash.</p>
<p>"I think you can use a hand-held in that situation," quipped the CBC's Stefani Langenegger.</p>
<p>The Sask. Party government intends to pass a bill banning the use of hand-held cellphones while driving during this legislative session.</p>
<p>With the accused suspect in the crime hailing from Pense, Langenegger also noted later that he was a constituent of Stewart's.</p>
<p>The Thunder Creek MLA should probably not count on that vote in 2011.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Premier Brad Wall said that there had been some concern among the government caucus when Stewart hadn't shown up for a caucus meeting and question period Thursday morning.</p>
<p>MLAs can be fined $200 for missing a sitting day of the legislative assembly.</p>
<p>But as Wall noted, the Thunder Creek MLA did ultimately show up, with a pretty good excuse to boot.</p>
<p>And really, after what happened, who would try to collect the fine?</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>There are second acts in Saskatchewan politics -- as witnessed by his worship, Glenn Hagel.</p>
<p>Hagel served 21 years as an NDP MLA, including stints as a cabinet minister, speaker of the legislative assembly and head of the province's centennial celebrations in 2005.</p>
<p>But the Saskatchewan Party was calling for Hagel's head in 2007 in their last legislative session as Opposition, over his handling of a case of employee fraud when he chaired the NDP caucus in 1992.</p>
<p>Hagel ended up having to step down from cabinet and losing his Moose Jaw North seat by a mere 31 votes to the Sask. Party's Warren Michelson in the 2007 election.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, though, he was elected mayor of Moose Jaw with nearly 65 per cent of the vote.</p>
<p>There were few government members clapping in the assembly when Moose Jaw Wakamow MLA and NDP deputy leader Deb Higgins congratulated Hagel in members' statements Thursday.</p>
<p>But Wall said there was no bad blood, and that Michelson had offered his congratulations to the new mayor in person just as he had in a phone message.</p>
<p>"We're going to work with Glenn," the premier said in an interview full of nothing but good words for Hagel.</p>
<p>"Glenn was always I think in this legislature one of the ablest communicators, period. And through the centennial celebrations ... he was tireless. He is going to do very well for Moose Jaw from that perspective."</p>
<p>Hagel has said he will be a non-partisan mayor and Wall said the nature of civic politics makes it easy for people of various political stripes to work together well.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Municipal politics is usually seen as a stepping-stone to higher office but, as Hagel demonstrates, the reverse is often true.</p>
<p>Saskatoon saw the re-election of two former NDP cabinet ministers -- Bob Pringle and Pat Lorje -- to city council along with Glen Penner, a Liberal MLA in the 1970s.</p>
<p>All across the province there were municipal candidates with strong connections to provincial politics.</p>
<p>Joining Hagel on Moose Jaw council is Don Mitchell, a former mayor, "Waffle" NDP leadership candidate and sometime gadfly to current NDP Leader Dwain Lingenfelter. Also elected was Terry Coleman, the former Moose Jaw police chief who was hired and fired by the Sask. Party government as a deputy minister.</p>
<p>However, provincial Green Party Leader Larissa Shasko couldn't make the cut in Moose Jaw's at-large council race.</p>
<p>In Yorkton, 2007 provincial NDP candidate Randy Goulden also narrowly lost a race for the mayor's chair.</p>
<p>And in Swift Current, Wall's dad, John, decided not to run again after five terms on the city council, which were preceded by two terms on school board.</p>
<p>The premier -- who once joked his family was "the Mennonite version of the Kennedys" for its political involvement -- said his dad's final council meeting was emotional but John was comfortable with his decision to step down.</p>
<p>But the premier acknowledged his mom will have to get used to seeing more of his dad around the house.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The race in Regina's Ward 2, meanwhile, seemed to be a proxy fight between the NDP and Sask. Party.</p>
<p>The incumbent was Jocelyn Hutchinson, who won the seat in 2006 after her husband, longtime councilor Bill Hutchinson, stepped aside so he could run for the Sask. Party in Regina South. He's now First Nations and Metis Relations Minister.</p>
<p>Squaring off against Hutchinson in the ward was NDP volunteer Heather McIntyre.</p>
<p>Hutchinson's campaign saw large Sask. Party-style green and gold campaign signs which touted that she was "the only candidate who lives in Ward 2." McIntyre's signs -- also prominent -- said she was the only candidate talking about the issues.</p>
<p>In a tough fight, Hutchinson took 52 per cent of the vote to McIntyre's 48 per cent on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The next day there was some heckling from both sides across the floor of the legislature.</p>
<p>"Our machine was better than your machine," volleyed Hutchinson.</p>
<p>The heckling from the Opposition side, meanwhile, seemed to suggest McIntyre may end up taking on the cabinet minister in Regina South in 2011.</p>
<p>"Heather's got your number, Bill," Higgins was heard to comment.</p>
<p>"And she lives in the riding."</p>
<p>Hutchinson actually lives just outside the Regina South constituency, in Regina Lakeview.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The legislative session began with the anticipation that Health Minister Don McMorris would be a lot busier in the chamber than he had been in the past.</p>
<p>With wait time guarantees, health care labour unrest and H1N1 on the agenda, expectations proved correct. McMorris was perpetually on his feet during question period this week, responding to far more NDP salvos than any other minister.</p>
<p>The Opposition attention may be having an impact on the usually affable McMorris.</p>
<p>In response to one H1N1 question from health critic Judy Junor on Thursday, he snapped this comment:</p>
<p>"Thank you Mr. Speaker. I will forward my remarks through you to the critic. And I'll try and do it slow so she can completely understand."</p>
<p>But Junor -- a bit of a needler herself -- had the last laugh.</p>
<p>Later that day it came to light that McMorris was unaware of discussions that had taken place between health bureaucrats and the B.C. government about potentially shipping patients out of Saskatchewan for surgeries.</p>
<p>"It's interesting the minister wasn't in the loop. Perhaps they didn't speak slow enough."</p>

<p>A circus bear on skates attacked two people during a rehearsal for a show in Bishkek, Kyrgyzstan. That kind of mauling is nothing new for CBC viewers who have watched Tie Domi with partner Christine Hough-Sweeney on Battle of the Blades ... The bear had every reason to be irked at his handlers. He had just found out they had traded him to the Toronto Maple Leafs ... In a related story, Leafs supporters can't bear to watch their team this season ... If you've ever wondered how old Chicago Wolves blueliner Chris Chelios really is, George Ofman of beachwoodreporter.com has the answer: "Chris Chelios is so old, he walked into an antique store ... and they kept him. Chris Chelios is so old, he has hieroglyphics on his driver's licence. Chris Chelios is so old, he fixed up Adam and Eve.''</p>

"Concrete ramps at the new Yankee Stadium have developed cracks, and the team is trying to determine what went wrong," noted Reggie Hayes of the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel. "In the meantime, they have asked (hefty lefty) CC Sabathia to take another entrance into the stadium."</p>
<p>Comedy writer Alex Kaseberg has come up with a drinking game for those who are watching the baseball playoffs on Fox. "Take a drink when announcer Tim McCarver says something obvious," Kaseberg wrote. "(On Sunday) night I was drunk by the second inning, passed out in my own mess in the fifth and by the ninth inning I was in rehab weeping about my lonely childhood." ... St. Louis Cardinals manager Tony La Russa has picked steroid-tainted Mark McGwire to be the Cardinals' hitting coach.

<p>This week's wacky soccer story comes from Spain, where Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo is nursing an ankle injury. What makes it strange is that Pepe the Witch -- a self-proclaimed sorcerer -- claims the injury is the result of a curse he put on Ronaldo at the behest of Paris Hilton after she was dumped by Ronaldo. Sounds like Ronaldo has sustained a "lover body injury" ... "I never wear them except for the night that I get them.

Proctor was wearing only his boots and holding a cowboy hat in a strategic spot while he stood in a pen to pose with a bull. So what did Proctor do when the animal suddenly charged? "I dropped my hat and ran up on the fence," he told the Las Vegas Review-Journal. "He was about to horn up on my business."</p>

</p>
<p>Here's some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you'll be able to find much more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza which is different than the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions and pregnant women may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus - also known as human swine influenza - is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>HOW IS IT SPREAD?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches their mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>CONTAGIOUSNESS</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomitting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of your hand</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health care provider.</p>
<p>TREATMENT</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>VACCINATION</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>
