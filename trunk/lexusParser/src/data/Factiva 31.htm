<p>MONTREAL -- Sally Youness walked into the hospital ER with her young son and immediately got handed a child-sized hospital face mask. It had Mickey Mouse stamped all over it.</p>
<p>“Halloween is coming,” Ms. Youness quipped to the triage nurse.</p>
<p>It was a lighthearted moment in an otherwise cheerless tableau at a downtown Montreal pediatric hospital yesterday: dozens of parents with their children filling every available seat in the waiting room, driven there by anxiety over the H1N1 virus. Many wore face masks too.</p>
<p>Montreal's two pediatric hospitals are being swamped by so many fearful parents that one pediatrician called it an “H1N1 psychosis.” At the Montreal Children's Hospital, 300 children are showing up on average each day in an ER equipped to treat 180 of them.</p>
<p>Confronted with the spike, the Children's and Sainte-Justine's hospitals called a joint news conference yesterday to warn that panic over H1N1 threatens to divert their ER resources from real emergencies.</p>
<p>“If we continue to be inundated by children who aren't very sick, then when your child becomes very sick, we'll have trouble treating him appropriately,” said Michael Arseneault, medical manager of emergency services at Sainte-Justine.</p>
<p>The recent deaths of two Ontario children have sparked understandable concerns among many parents, but the doctors said most cases being brought to their hospitals are benign. The Children's Hospital estimated that up to three-quarters of the children who showed up at ER this week had only mild flu-related symptoms.</p>
<p>The doctors' message to parents: Use your good judgment, treat mild flu symptoms at home, and consult your family doctor or neighbourhood community clinic.</p>
<p>“Of course H1N1 shouldn't be taken lightly. It's important,” Dr. Arsenault said. “But it's gotten amplified, and a kind of phobia has taken hold.”</p>
<p>Ms. Youness went to the Children's Hospital in downtown Montreal on the advice of a physician. Her four-year-old son had a fever for three days straight, felt heavy-chested and had started to suffer from diarrhea.</p>
<p>While she was calm, H1N1 fears were spreading around her. At her son's daycare, about a quarter of his usual 20 playmates were absent; some parents were keeping them home as a safeguard. The Ontario deaths set off alarms for many parents – “It's freaking everybody out,” Ms. Youness said.</p>
<p>It's also sending Quebeckers flooding to vaccination centres to get H1N1 shots. At one such centre near Montreal yesterday, the line stretched for hours and impatience started to set in.</p>
<p>Quebec began giving H1N1 shots to health-care workers and long-term care patients this week, with a gradual rollout ending with vaccinations for healthy adults and children over five years old beginning on Dec. 7.</p>

<p>TORONTO and WINNIPEG -- The federal government has warned the provinces they will receive less H1N1 vaccine than promised, forcing health-care clinics across the country to delay the rollout of their pandemic programs to the general public just as demand soars.</p>
<p>Supply is so short in Manitoba that stocks could run out by next Tuesday. British Columbia is delaying plans to provide the flu shot to everyone. And health officials at a clinic in Toronto, unable to handle the crowds, turned people away less than an hour after opening.</p>
<p>The number of people lining up for one of the largest mass immunization campaigns in Canadian history is well above what anyone had expected.</p>
<p>Provincial governments had based their pandemic planning on how many people get the seasonal flu shot – typically less than half the population.</p>
<p>But they revised those plans after the H1N1 virus claimed the life of a previously healthy Toronto boy.</p>
<p>The death of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio acted as a wakeup call for many parents who prior to that had not planned to get their children vaccinated, said Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews.</p>
<p>“I think the public got a bit complacent and I think that's now changing,” she said in an interview.</p>
<p>Canadians are heeding the advice of health-care experts to get the flu shot just as the provinces are poised to receive less vaccine next week. <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, Canada's vaccine supplier, is switching its production to a vaccine intended for pregnant women, a federal health spokesman said. Canada has ordered just over a million doses of unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women, one of the most at-risk groups, because there is not enough clinical data on the immune-boosting adjuvant contained in the vaccine that others are getting.</p>
<p>Clinics are already overwhelmed by demand, with some healthy Canadians jumping to the front of the queue despite the pleas of health-care officials to let those more likely to develop complications from the virus get vaccinated first. The vaccine shortage left provincial health officials scrambling to revise their plans.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, British Columbia's public health officer, said the rollout of its H1N1 program will now be phased in, depending on the availability of vaccine. “Our target of making vaccine available to every British Columbian who wants a dose will unfortunately be put back a bit,” Dr. Kendall said in an e-mail yesterday.</p>
<p>In Manitoba, Health Minister Theresa Oswald suggested vaccine shortages could bog down the province's entire pandemic plan, delaying the opening of H1N1 clinics for the general population. Health officials in the province had been assured of receiving 134,000 doses every week, but last Wednesday only 72,000 doses arrived, Ms. Oswald said. “This may mean that regional health authorities will have to announce that they are postponing clinics that they had previously announced.”</p>
<p>In just four days of H1N1 clinics, more than 47,000 Winnipeggers have been immunized and the city's clinics were full to capacity yesterday.</p>
<p>In Toronto, residents lined up for hours yesterday at two immunization clinics that opened for high-risk groups. Other regions in Ontario began immunizing high-risk groups on Monday.</p>
<p>Asked why Toronto, the epicentre of the deadly SARS outbreak in 2002, has been slow, David McKeown, medical officer of health, defended the response. He said the priority this week was to vaccinate health-care workers, so that they could keep the system running.</p>
<p>Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Arlene King, vowed yesterday to open more clinics and have existing ones expand their operations to help cope with overwhelming demand.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, delays in distributing the vaccine to the provinces sparked opposition finger-pointing aimed at Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>“Does she not understand that these delays have cost and will cost lives?” said Liberal MP Bob Rae. The government response was that six million vaccine doses will be delivered by the end of today, and another three million next week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Helping kids breathe easier - H1N1 outbreak a new challenge for his profession</b>

<p>Todd Mortimer has always found his job as a respiratory therapist challenging.</p>
<p>Now, with a second wave of the H1N1 pandemic upon us, Mortimer and his co-workers in the Health Science Centre pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) are girding themselves for what could be a tsunami of young patients.</p>
<p>On Thursday, there were three suspected and one confirmed case of H1N1 in the pediatric ICU. The children were all under the age of five.</p>
<p>"It's new and definitely catching our attention because of the newness and because the way it presents itself in different ways," says Mortimer, 42.</p>
<p>Most flus, he says, strike the very young, the elderly or those with underlying health problems. H1N1 hasn't been following that pattern.</p>
<p>The eight-bed HSC PICU has been extended to 10 beds. There are plans to go to 14 beds. This is ground zero for the majority of children who will become seriously ill with the virus.</p>
<p>If need be, the hospital will set up more pediatric ICU beds throughout the hospital.</p>
<p>HSC saw between 30 and 40 per cent of the Canadian pediatric H1N1 cases in the first wave of the illness. There were seven pediatric deaths in Canada. Only one was in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>"We're planning for different worst-case scenarios," Mortimer says. "The team here at PICU is an extraordinary team."</p>
<p>Mortimer got his H1N1 shot Monday, the first day it was offered in Manitoba.</p>
<p>The entire PICU, like so many wards in every hospital, is kept as sterile as possible. The compromised patients can't be exposed to any outside threats.</p>
<p>HSC will get patients from across Manitoba, parts of Ontario and Nunavut. Confirmed cases are already showing up in the hospital's emergency room.</p>
<p>A walk through the PICU is heartbreaking. Tiny children lie in beds, tubes and masks practically swallowing them. Some are burn victims. Others are the H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>Teams of professionals watch their every heartbeat and breath. These are the most vulnerable patients, the wee ones who need around-the-clock medical attention.</p>
<p>Respiratory therapists (RTs for short) help patients by managing their airways and their ventilators. They intubate patients or supply them with mask ventilation to help them breathe. It's a fast-paced job that often begins in the emergency room. Cardiac and respiratory arrests require an RT.</p>
<p>Any time you hear a code called in a hospital, an RT is part of team racing to help a critically ill patient.</p>
<p>Mortimer or other RTs are also called upon when there's a high-risk delivery at the Women's Hospital. A premature baby will likely need help breathing. They're ready for all cases of neonatal distress.</p>
<p>Still, theirs is usually an uncelebrated profession.</p>
<p>"RTs are really under the radar," he says. "Most people have never heard of us. But we're there."</p>
<p>There are roughly 8,000 registered respiratory therapists in Canada. There are approximately 250 in Manitoba.</p>
<p>RTs have to be registered with the Manitoba Association of Registered Respiratory Therapists. Most have completed a three- or four-year program.</p>
<p>They graduate with a bachelor of medical rehabilitation -- respiratory therapy degree.</p>
<p>Mortimer, who's been at HSC for 19 years, has been teaching future respiratory therapists for the past 15 years. He also oversees some of the administrative functions of his department.</p>
<p>He earns approximately $77,000 a year.</p>
<p>His interest in health care began with his mother, a nurse.</p>
<p>"Some of these things just happen by chance," he says. "I was introduced to the program by some medical friends of my mother. It was never really a plan."</p>
<p>He has spent his entire career at HSC. An average day might see him teaching, giving an in-service to nurses and performing "hands-on, bedside care."</p>
<p>There are meetings to attend, many of them related to H1N1. It's not all flashing lights and beeping monitors and rushing adrenalin.</p>
<p>The married father of two pauses when he's asked how difficult it is when a patient dies.</p>
<p>"I get that (question) a lot," he says. "'How do you work with kids?' We infrequently have poor outcomes," he says, earnestly.</p>
<p>"It's infrequent. I know we're doing a good job here. We have state-of-the-art technology. If a kid gets sick I want to be involved."</p>
<p>Part of his job is to talk to parents.</p>
<p>"We have to do that every day. My position is I give them the best and most accurate information."</p>
<p>There's a sense that a clock is ticking in this PICU and in every emergency room across the country. Truly, no one knows what the pandemic will bring. Todd Mortimer knows this:</p>
<p>"We have a terrific team and we've been preparing for this. We do our jobs well. We're been planning for whatever is coming."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>In the battle against H1N1, these ads are different strains; Changing behaviour is not like selling soap. But each territory has its own approach</b>

<p>shoupt@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>It's like something out of a horror film. A man, coughing and sneezing from the flu, leaves a trail of grimy green fingerprints behind him as he makes his way home from the office. The fingerprints – a bit of poetic filmmaking licence used to illustrate live flu germs – appear on the Stop button of his bus and on the front door of his house. Then, after the sickly fellow arrives home and turns off the TV with a remote control, his young son picks up the device, turns the TV back on and – in horrifying slow motion – places a germ-riddled thumb into his tiny mouth.</p>
<p>The creepy moment is from an ad that hit airwaves this week in Britain, where the Department of Health is in the midst of rolling out its mass media campaign to raise awareness of the H1N1 virus, one of many such government efforts around the northern hemisphere to combat the infectious disease.</p>
<p>Most global campaigns – say, for movies, music releases, or software launches – are driven centrally by a single corporation. But the approaches to combatting H1N1 are as varied as the territories themselves. And while the aim of most marketing is to sell a product, ad industry executives admit that changing human behaviour – vital in fighting disease – through conventional advertising presents a far tougher challenge.</p>
<p>Here in Canada, the federal government has been under fire for poor communication, which some say has allowed misinformation to spread. During a press briefing this week, Leona Aglukkaq, the Minister of Health, was pestered by a reporter who insisted the ads weren't reaching the public. Ms. Aglukkaq disagreed.</p>
<p>It may be that the reporter simply didn't notice them. The TV commercial developed by Health Canada is a bland, purely informational spot, featuring a racially diverse array of Canadians behaving cautiously and properly: a mother and daughter washing their hands together, an office worker squirting an alcohol-based sanitizer into his hand, a woman at lunch sneezing into her arm, a man spraying disinfectant on the door handle of his fridge, and a miserable-looking fellow laid out on the couch blowing his nose into a tissue.</p>
<p>Other countries recognize the need to grab a viewing public with entertainment value. In an amateur U.S. spot that won a contest sponsored by the Centers for Disease Control, someone energetically rubs the bristles of a toothbrush against heavily used public surfaces: an ATM, a computer mouse, a handrail, even a cat. The final text solves the mystery of what we're watching: “It's the same as touching your mouth without washing your hands.”</p>
<p>Jonathan Hill, business director at DDB London, the agency that developed the spot for Britain's Department of Health, says using advertising to change behaviour is different than using it to sell a product. “If I were trying to convince you to buy one soap over another, I'm trying to give you a reason to believe one is better than another, so when you're in a supermarket, you'll remember that reason and you'll think, ‘Oh, I'll give it a go.' You'll either buy it or you won't,” he says.</p>
<p>“What we're dealing with here is changing a mindset, changing an attitude; it's a more complex and difficult thing to do, because people's habits around hygiene are formed largely as children.” Yesterday, Mr. Hill noted that he could still recall the rhyme he heard in classrooms as a child in postwar Britain: ‘Coughs and sneezes spread diseases.'</p>
<p>“There was a reason it was done and targeted around schools, because that was a very fertile area. Kids' minds are open to new ways of doing things much better than adults,” he said. With that in mind, theDepartment of Health website offered a short story last year featuring a popular children's character, Dirty Bertie, learning the lessons of proper hygiene.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Hill added that some product ads have operated in a similar manner to the current flu campaigns. Manufacturers of hybrid cars, for example, tend to emphasize characteristics unique to their category rather than the on-board features and low prices that monopolize other auto pitches. “That operates within a wider context – as this does – because we don't have to go and tell people there's swine flu out there, the media's doing that for us. Everybody else is telling people the reason why they should be doing something, so we have to nuance our message within that context.”</p>
<p>The CDC in the United States is currently trying to walk a fine balance between education and overselling. With national vaccine stocks lower than it had hoped, the U.S. cannot afford to drive citizens en masse to flu shot clinics. It will be rolling out the majority of its TV and radio spots, which have been heavily reworked through focus group research, in late November.</p>
<p>But in the meantime, it doesn't want to actively discourage people from seeking the vaccine. When the U.S. ran low on vaccines during the 2004-05 flu season, the non-profit Ad Council rushed a spot on air showing someone visiting a laundromat in a space suit, pointing out that one didn't need to go to extremes to avoid illness. But research years later found that people still remembered the message and believed that washing their hands was as dependable a method to avoid the flu as getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>“We always worry, have we emphasized the hand-washing message too much?” says Kristine Sheedy, the director of communication for CDC's national centre for immunization and respiratory disease.</p>
<p>Another arm of the CDC may be finding an exception to Mr. Hill's belief in the difficulty of changing behaviour. Just as consumer marketers are in thrall these days to the charms of social media, a small unit at the CDC has found success in using social media. One of the CDC's Twitter feeds, which had a base of less than 3,000 followers in April, now boasts more than one million. It has a presence on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and MySpace, and provides numerous widgets that allow bloggers to add CDC content to their websites.</p>
<p>In September, it launched a three-month text-message pilot program for mobile phones. And an e-card initiative that allows people to send personalized notes to loved ones about the importance of everything from breast cancer screening to donating blood, boasts a click-through rate of about 80 per cent. Ann Aikin, a social media specialist at the CDC, offers this theory for its success that marketers everywhere are trying to ape: “We think that's because someone you know and trust is sending it to you.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 detected 13 days after fever onset</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS   </div>

<p>After spending a few days in bed with a fever, sore throat, aches and other symptoms most likely caused by the H1N1 virus, you feel ready to jump back into your routine.</p>
<p>But new evidence suggests that you could still be spreading the virus for a few days after your fever breaks.</p>
<p>Researchers with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that elementary school children who contracted the H1N1 virus during an outbreak earlier this year tested positive for the virus up to 13 days after the onset of fever.</p>
<p>The findings, led by researchers at the CDC and the Pennsylvania Department of Health, are being presented at the Infectious Disease Society of America's annual meeting in Philadelphia. They raise questions about H1N1's contagiousness and whether those infected should take steps to avoid infecting others even after they've recovered.</p>
<p>In the study, researchers focused on a group of 26 children infected by an H1N1 outbreak at a Pennsylvania elementary school in May and June. Researchers used two tests to confirm illness in each child and detect how long the virus remained present in their bodies.</p>
<p>One test is known as real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction – or rRT-PCR for short. The second test involved confirming presence of H1N1 through testing specimens taken from the children.</p>
<p>Using the first test, researchers found that the children tested positive for the H1N1 virus from one to 13 days after the onset of fever, with a median period of six days. Using the virus culture test, they found H1N1 present from one to seven days after the onset of fever, with a median period of five days.</p>
<p>It's a significant finding that may change conventional thinking about the contagious period associated with H1N1.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada says that people with H1N1 may be contagious for up to seven days after the onset of symptoms. But as more research emerges suggesting that period could last even longer, it may require public health officials to modify their communication.</p>
<p>However, one of the researchers involved in the study said the findings should not be cause for alarm and that they must be examined further to assess potential implications.</p>
<p>The results “should be interpreted cautiously, because detection of the virus may not mean that patients are likely to transmit the virus to others,” said Achuyt Bhattarai, an investigator with the CDC.</p>
<p>The medical community still doesn't have a great understanding of the relationship between the presence</p>
<p>of a virus in a given individual and their ability to pass it onto others, the authors said.</p>
<p>It's a link that must be studied further in order to determine the risk people who have recovered from viruses such as H1N1 pose to others in the days following their recovery.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>MDs dispel adjuvant concerns</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS   </div>

<p>The H1N1 flu virus is circulating through schools, offices and homes across Canada, but for some, the word “adjuvant” stirs more concern than the prospect of contracting the novel influenza virus.</p>
<p>Adjuvants, immune-boosting substances that help vaccines work, have been the subject of significant debate, controversy and confusion since the federal government announced they would be added to the Canadian vaccine. For many parents, the debate has taken on unique resonance as they hear confusing messages from public-health officials and conspiratorial websites about the safety record of the immune-boosting agents.</p>
<p>It has led some to question whether children – those under age 3, in particular – should wait until unadjuvanted vaccines are made available, or forgo vaccination altogether.</p>
<p>The confusion prompted the Canadian Paediatric Society to issue new information for physicians on the safety of the H1N1 vaccines and adjuvants, scheduled to be released on its website yesterday. “I know of no credible evidence to suggest it poses any risk to the children,” said Robert Bortolussi, a pediatric infectious disease specialist at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax and chair of the CPS's committee on infectious disease and immunization. “Even on a theoretical basis, it's hard to imagine it would.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bortolussi added small studies have shown adjuvants are safe in babies.</p>
<p>The adjuvant being added to Arepanrix, the H1N1 vaccine approved in Canada, is called AS03. It's a natural combination of several substances, including vitamin E and squalene derived from shark liver. Although this particular adjuvant hasn't been used in a Canadian influenza vaccine before, it has been tested on about 45,000 individuals using a vaccine designed to fight the H5N1 avian influenza. Adjuvants have also been widely used in Europe, and have been included in some other Canadian vaccines.</p>
<p>The adjuvant boosts the body's immune response because it allows the antigen, the active ingredient in vaccines, to remain at the injection site longer and attract a large amount of immune cells to help the body develop antibodies to the virus, said Dr. Bortolussi. That also means less antigen is required in adjuvanted vaccines, allowing drug companies to produce more vaccine quickly.</p>
<p>The vast majority of H1N1 vaccines distributed in Canada will contain adjuvants, but the government has purchased a small supply of unadjuvanted vaccine to be used by some pregnant women and children under three, if parents choose.</p>
<p>There is no data that has looked at the safety of adjuvants in pregnant women and limited data on children under 3. But Canadian health experts have agreed the risk of adjuvanted vaccine appears small, so are recommending that women over 20 weeks gestation receive it if an unadjuvanted vaccine isn't available. Public-health experts also agree that adjuvanted vaccine is safe for use in children as young as six months, and say adjuvanted vaccine is best for that age group because it produces the best immune response. The H1N1 vaccine is not recommended for babies under six months.</p>
<p>Although parents can choose to give their children unadjuvanted vaccine, Canada's chief public health officer David Butler-Jones told The Canadian Press that he “wouldn't wait” until it became available to give it to his grandchildren.</p>

<p>I abandoned all hope for CBC's news makeover Tuesday morning when host Anne-Marie Mediwake was on the phone with the dad who'd just lost his 13-year-old son to H1N1. He was losing control and sobbing but she wouldn't leave him any dignity or privacy. “I'm going to give you a chance to tell us how you want him remembered,” she said, or something close. He dissolved further. Then a swift shift to cheery chat with a reporter about coffee.</p>
<p>Hm. Being shallow and exploitative isn't as easy as it looks at the U.S. cable networks on which CBC's new format is modelled. They'd have known to at least fake some sympathy, conceal the egomania (“I'm going to give you a chance”) and break for an ad or somehow transition to the vacuous coffee item. If it isn't your game, you really shouldn't play it.</p>
<p>Wednesday's flagship The National with Peter Mansbridge puffed three scare stories off the top. H1N1 (“People are getting scared …”). Another fright: Musician killed by coyotes. And, “hidden costs that may be lurking on your cellphone bill.” They were all scare, no context. When a doctor said flu cases were mainly mild, the reporter intoned, “Mild illness.” PAUSE. “Mostly.” That's alarmism, not journalism. The cell story showed a reporter striding into a building to meet a rep for the phone firms and it was Bernard Lord, former N.B. premier and Conservative heavy. The item didn't mention it. Perhaps some well-paid consultants from the U.S. coaching the CBC, told them, “Skip it. Nobody cares. Focus on the phones. People relate to those.”</p>
<p>This is all about talking down to dim, self-absorbed viewers, with weak attention spans who don't care about complex issues or, yuck, details. About “relating'” to them. “Connect,” as Mark Kelley's new nightly segment is called. But (with apologies to the late Johnny Cochrane) you can't connect without respect. What you get is a parody of connection.</p>
<p>The CBC execs are beside themselves with the thrill of it. Their endless in-house memos rely heavily on triple exclamation marks as punctuation: “The energy in the building is palpable … The torch has been passed … We have moved from a Buick to a Ferrari …!!!” (Oddly dated images, by the way, and insulting.)</p>
<p>It's as though it's all about them: their new sets and graphics, full-page ads, U.S. consultants. Watching CBC news now feels like living inside English-language boss Richard Stursberg's head, the man who endowed the CBC with a “factual entertainment” department. Yet, oddly it is still a public network, paid for by all of us. In ancient times, the founder of the National Film Board, John Grierson, used to remind employees daily that they were there to serve the people of Canada, not his own abundant ego. That simple thought out of Richard Stursberg's mouth is unimaginable. Instead, the people who pay are treated as bottom-feeders not worth a reference to a former premier or a translation from the Greek in yesterday's Olympic torch feed from Athens. (CTV had a translation.) Let them eat sets and graphics. Low-rent TVO's nightly hour, The Agenda, now outdoes anything on CBC.</p>
<p>I'm not pining here for the good old days of CBC news, even if the new news makes the old news look better than it was. CBC news was always a pain in the butt. It was pompous, clichéd and had a generous bias for those with power, in business or government. But it was a serious pain that took serious time for important topics, then distorted them. You could still find some of those stories this week –Terry Milewski on the Harper prison agenda, an interview with the man who filmed the Dziekanski tasering – but they were so brief. “You can find more on our website,” barks Peter. Now here's another scary one. What will they do when Halloween is past?</p>
<p>CBC's best days as a public broadcaster were always ahead of it. Today, more than ever.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Heckle all you want ...but not if you're sexist</b>
</div><div>Chris Selley    </div>
<div>Special To The National Post</div>
<div>654 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>

<p>You may not be surprised to learn that Jack Layton believes sexism is rampant in the House of Commons. "During Question Period, we have been witnessing undeniably sexist heckling from members of the government side," he pronounced Wednesday. "This abuse is growing hotter, it is growing more frequent and there is more bullying."</p>
<p>Mr. Layton was ostensibly sticking up for his Commons colleague, the Liberal health critic Dr. Carolyn Bennett, who on Monday was rather bizarrely -- and, it must be said, shamefully -- shouted down as she asked a question about the government's response to the H1N1 flu, particularly as it affects pregnant women.</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Bennett doesn't need anyone to stick up for her, as her furious reaction would have demonstrated to anyone hitherto unfamiliar with her. "This isn't funny," she roared, jabbing her finger Torywards -- the most genuine moment of anger I've seen from the House in ages. And she's right: It isn't funny. But it's interesting she's not making as big a deal out the sexism angle as Mr. Layton. It's almost as if he had something other than Dr. Bennett's good name in mind.</p>
<p>Would a male Conservative health critic have been accused of sexism if Dr. Bennett was the minister? Search me. Sexist; not sexist; I have no idea. Trying to figure out whether a particular volley of Question Period heckling is sexist, or racist, or classist or just plain idiotic, is like trying to figure what kind of wood the spear sticking out of your chest is made of -- a fruitless pursuit that entirely misses the point.</p>
<p>Indeed, that a Canadian politician would demand an end to sexist heckling tells you most of what you need to know. A non-politician would instead propose doing away with heckling, period.</p>
<p>This is not as difficult a task as it's sometimes made out to be. All it requires is for MPs to elect a speaker willing to enforce a broader interpretation of the existing parliamentary rules. To wit, Standing Order 16: "When a Member is speaking, no Member shall ... interrupt him or her, except to raise a point of order." Or Standing Order 18: "No Member shall speak disrespectfully of [or] use offensive words against ... any Member thereof."</p>
<p>As for the Liberal accusations that the Tories have outrageously politicized H1N1, alas, that narrative went a bit pear-shaped on Wednesday. Grand Chief Roy Evans of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs told a Commons committee he wasn't too pleased with a flyer, sent from Dr. Bennett's office, alleging "no vaccines, just body bags," had been sent to aboriginal reserves. Chief Evans suggested this amounted to, well, politicizing the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>He's right, and Dr. Bennett apologized.</p>
<p>Non-political types might also point out how silly it was for Dr. Bennett to still be banging on about the body-bag thing, since it emerged weeks ago that a nurse at Manitoba's Wasagamack First Nation had in fact ordered them--and that the bags certainly weren't sent instead of H1N1 supplies. (They might also note Dr. Bennett's flyer was one of those taxpayer-funded "10-percenters," political misuse of which the Liberals claim to abhor.) But in the House of Commons, they'd be pitching their case to 300 or so vacant stares.</p>
<p>There is, of course, a legitimate debate to be had over how, when and to whom Canada is rolling out the H1N1 vaccine. But it is not and will not be conducted in the House of Commons. If anyone in there actually thinks his party is favoured over any other by this incredibly unedifying sideshow -- heckling and hooting and sexism allegations and body bags --he's dreaming.</p>

<p>At 11 a.m. yesterday, an hour before an H1N1 vaccination clinic opened its doors, a mob of people rushed a Toronto Public Health worker handing out patient forms in the crowded North York Civic Centre.</p>
<p>Outside, hundreds had waited for hours on the square for the vaccinations to begin. And 15 minutes after the clinic opened at noon, the line was shut off to new patients. Workers were stationed on the plaza to tell any new arrivals -- all seniors, parents with young children and pregnant women -- to go home.</p>
<p>"I feel really disappointed," said new mother Yan Cheng, 28, who brought her six-and-a-half-month-old daughter to be immunized. "Why don't they open more locations for people? It's horrible."</p>
<p>Hundreds in the high-risk group -- which includes children six months to five years old, people with chronic conditions, and those with compromised immune systems -- had been lining up since 6 a.m. From 9 a.m. to noon, the clinic only provided shots for health-care workers.</p>
<p>Similarly long lineups were reported at the East York Civic Centre yesterday.</p>
<p>Dr. David McKeown, the medical officer for Toronto Public Health, told reporters at the North York Civic Centre just after noon that there was enough vaccine for everyone already in line, but that they couldn't handle any more people.</p>
<p>"The demand has been such that we don't want people to come wait when they're not able to be immunized," he said. "It's better for them to go to one of the other clinics that will be held over the next few days."</p>
<p>The lineup snaked its way in front of Mel Lastman Square, nearly spilling onto the street.</p>
<p>Grace Park, who wore a face mask while she waited, was told she was the last one in line, and that it could be seven hours before she was vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I'm debating whether to stay," she said. "I'm pregnant, I can't stand for seven hours."</p>
<p>Still, most people thought the wait was a small price to pay for peace of mind.</p>
<p>An H1N1 outbreak was confirmed yesterday at Bridgepoint Health, off Broadview Avenue, which treats chronic diseases. Eleven patients and five health-care workers have contracted the virus and are receiving treatment.</p>

<p>The distribution of the H1N1 vaccine for vulnerable people this week has been a fiasco. After observing two lineups in two days, I am shocked at the disrespect for the chronically ill people hoping to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>I was waiting with a seriously ill friend. First we waited at the Cook Street clinic for two hours, only to be told that they were out after about 450 people and to go home. On Wednesday morning we heard that Hillside Mall was out. We lined up outside at Gordon Head Recreation Centre. After waiting almost two hours, and watching latecomers jumping the line in desperation, we were again told to leave. Only about 200 vaccines were given out, but we were told to try the Can West Mall the next day.</p>
<p>These are people with chronic illnesses; many were supported by walkers and obviously should not have been outside for two hours. By my count about 1,000 vaccines given out in three days for all the individuals with chronic conditions. If we take a generous estimate of 2,000 vaccinations per week, we are looking at 165 weeks to get all the region's residents vaccinated.</p>
<p>Give the vaccine to the doctors and have some well-organized clinics to supplement this existing distribution system.</p>

</p>
<p>I am a family physician and I am going to get my H1N1 flu shot and so are my children. I hope that my fellow Canadians will too.</p>
<p>Based on what occurred in the Southern Hemisphere during their winter this year, it is expected that about 80 per cent or more of the influenza virus circulating this year will be H1N1 and about 20 per cent seasonal flu.</p>
<p>There is a lot of misinformation being passed from person to person about the flu vaccine. And unfortunately many are simply accepting what they hear as fact.</p>
<p>Why do people who would never use <span class="companylink">Google</span>, or the opinions of friends and colleagues, to decide that they knew more than their lawyer, engineer or architect, decide that they know better than their physicians? Or the PhDs in immunology and microbiology and public health who research these issues for months or years and have the scientific background to be able to truly evaluate the research and safety data?</p>
<p>How could all the scientists and physicians and governments who are all looking at the data and recommending vaccination be wrong?</p>
<p>Here are the facts: The seasonal flu vaccine and H1N1 vaccine are called subunit vaccines which do not introduce live or whole flu virus into the body.</p>
<p>The flu vaccine delivers a minute quantity of a sterilized, purified portion of the influenza virus into the body. The immune system is then stimulated to respond and in about two weeks this results in immunity.</p>
<p>When someone gets the actual flu, they have had whole, live influenza virus enter the body through nose and mouth. The influenza virus attaches to the nasopharynx cells, then enters and reproduces within them. Millions and millions of live viruses are then released, teeming throughout the person's body and bloodstream. This is an overwhelming attack and as the battle ensues and the immune system fights, the temperature rises, the body fatigues and the symptoms of influenza result. Most cases of H1N1 have been mild, but for some, and sometimes randomly, the battle is severe and death results.</p>
<p>Why would you choose for yourself, or much more importantly for your child, to come into contact with the live virus and submit to millions and millions of live, replicating viruses circulating for days and days?</p>
<p>Does it not make more sense to instead get a vaccine that injects a sterilized and killed tiny portion of that same virus? I have chosen this option for my children and for myself (including during my pregnancies) for over a decade and have no regrets.</p>
<p>The problem with subunit vaccines is that since they contain only a part of the virus, they often cannot stimulate a complete immune response, especially in those with weak immune systems such as young children, the elderly or those with chronic diseases. For that reason, scientists add adjuvants to vaccines. Adjuvants are immune-system stimulators that enhance the response to the vaccine. (The October 2009 issue of Scientific American has a thorough article on vaccines and adjuvants).</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine contains an oil-in-water adjuvant called squalene. Oil-in-water adjuvants have been studied and approved as safe and are used in various European vaccines, including their flu shots.</p>
<p>Something that puzzles me is how quickly people will put into their own and their children's bodies anything labelled as an immune stimulant if it is sold in a natural products store. These products do not have long-term safety data, are less rigorously tested for safety than vaccines and adjuvants and claims are often supported by very poor quality studies done by the companies selling the product.</p>
<p>There is a question I am frequently asked: If the nurses, paramedics and hospital workers are not getting vaccinated, doesn't that suggest that I should be concerned about getting vaccinated?</p>
<p>It is interesting that the rate of vaccination among health-care workers is similar to the rate in the general population.</p>
<p>The reason for this seems to be that health-care workers obtain their information about the vaccine and influenza in exactly the same way as the general public. They <span class="companylink">Google</span>, read newspapers and talk among themselves. There are no requirements for health-care workers to participate in any accredited educational programs related to vaccines or influenza.</p>
<p>To protect those at high risk from influenza, it is important that their caregivers be vaccinated so that they do not infect them.</p>
<p>It is particularly concerning that health-care workers could infect or kill our most vulnerable by choosing not to be vaccinated. Research indicates that H1N1 is infectious one day before symptoms and up to seven to 10 days afterwards.</p>
<p>H1N1 is now present in our community and will be spreading quickly. It's time for all of us to come together and protect ourselves and our families, and help to protect the vulnerable in our community. One way to do that is to get vaccinated. The vaccine takes two weeks to stimulate immunity, so it's important to be vaccinated as soon as it is available to you. That's what my family is planning to do.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Why I'm still unsure about a flu shot...</b>
</div><div>Jody Paterson   </div>
<div>Special to Times Colonist</div>
<div>800 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>What are we to take from the fact that a majority of adult Canadians don't want to be immunized against the H1N1 flu?</p>
<p>I know how they feel. I'm still on the fence myself about whether to get the shot. Being immunized definitely appears to be the logical, civic-minded choice, but there's this part of me that's just really hesitant about getting a flu shot.</p>
<p>And 51 per cent of Canadians apparently feel the same way.</p>
<p>Asked in an online poll this month about whether they'd be getting vaccinated against H1N1, more than half said no. That's up significantly from July, when only 38 per cent were saying no.</p>
<p>That fact must be a great disappointment to the public-health officials working hard on the H1N1 front. People were alarmed as all get-out when the new strain of influenza first took hold in Mexico, and the task back then looked like it was going to be about keeping a worried public calm until a vaccine could be developed.</p>
<p>Instead we've ended up here, with immunization now available but fewer Canadians actually wanting it. That's a fascinating turn of events.</p>
<p>What it suggests, more than anything, is that the public no longer knows who to trust about such things. That's especially true when it comes to flu shots.</p>
<p>We were terrified of H1N1 when it first started wreaking havoc in Mexico. I followed each new development with great interest as the virus took hold in the spring and had long conversations with my own adult children in hopes of getting them thinking about vaccination.</p>
<p>But then H1N1 arrived in our own towns. And in most cases it looked a lot like any other seasonal flu, except more people were getting it.</p>
<p>Public-health experts continued to emphasize that H1N1 had the potential to be a much more serious type of flu. People do die from it -- 94 so far in Canada. But it seems that the more H1N1 has taken hold, the more our skepticism about getting immunized has grown.</p>
<p>Canadians are skeptical of flu shots to begin with -- fewer than a third of us get the seasonal shot.</p>
<p>The peculiar thing is that we're generally pretty happy to get immunized. I got seven immunizations for a trip to Ghana a decade ago and didn't second-guess any of them. Most Canadians are quite willing to be immunized against major illnesses and to get their children immunized as well, so it's not like vaccination is a foreign concept.</p>
<p>Ah, but the flu shot -- for some reason, that's a whole different thing. North Americans overall just haven't taken to the flu shot, despite years of admonitions from public-health officials about the importance of doing so.</p>
<p>Is it because you need a shot every year? Or because you've had the flu many times and it hasn't killed you yet? Is it about the horror stories of vaccinations gone wrong that emerge just often enough to confirm your reluctance, or maybe a secret suspicion that it's good for your immune system to have to fight off illness on its own once in a while?</p>
<p>I admit to a little of all of those in my own feelings about getting a flu shot. And I know it's all about having an emotional reaction to the issue rather than a logical one. I hate being sick with the flu and I'm asthmatic to boot, so there's no sensible reason for me to resist inoculation.</p>
<p>In the case of H1N1, experiences in my own family this past month should have also pushed me toward immunization if logic had anything to do with it. My brother's wife is still recovering in hospital after a terrible bout of H1N1 that left her incapacitated and on a ventilator in the intensive-care unit for almost a week.</p>
<p>But there's something that I just can't get my head around when it comes to flu shots. I wish I understood my resistance better, because I like to think I make good choices when it comes to my health. Public-health officials might want to try to understand the resistance of people like me as well, because their messages clearly aren't having the desired effect if the majority of Canadians are saying no to a flu shot.</p>
<p>Please take my musings on this subject as nothing more than that. I offer no advice on whether to get an H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>I'm just saying that rightly or wrongly, many of us need more convincing.</p>

<p>Seniors are being asked to stay away from the special clinics doling out the H1N1 vaccine after public health officials learned vaccine delivery is slowing down.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, provincial health officer, said word came from federal health officials yesterday of the impending reduction in distribution of the H1N1 vaccine because of production problems.</p>
<p>"This means our vaccination program will be somewhat more targeted, somewhat more phased and will probably take longer than we thought it would," said Kendall.</p>
<p>As a result, public-health nurses will stop handing out shots to seniors for the seasonal flu and H1N1, said Dr. Richard Stanwick, chief medical officer of health for the Vancouver Island Health Authority.</p>
<p>Instead, they will focus on offering the H1N1 vaccine to this week's priority groups: pregnant women, people under the age of 65 with underlying health conditions such as asthma or diabetes, those in remote communities and First Nations people.</p>
<p>Stanwick said seniors can take confidence from findings showing people born in 1957 or earlier already have some immunity.</p>
<p>"With age comes not only wisdom but also immunity," he said. "These people are the best group, the most likely to fight off swine flu.</p>
<p>"Right now we need to focus on the groups that are at the greatest risk."</p>
<p>He also noted the only strain of flu now circulating in the community is the H1N1 variety. The seasonal flu has not arrived in B.C. and historically has never turned up before late December. In recent years, it's been showing up in February and March.</p>
<p>Anybody who wants a shot for seasonal flu can still approach their doctor or buy one from a pharmacy.</p>
<p>Those in line for H1N1 shots next week include children aged six months to five years, household contacts of infants and health-care workers, but the latter category has been narrowed down to include only those working on the front lines, such as intensive-care units or emergency rooms.</p>
<p>Some H1N1 vaccine is expected to be distributed to GPs next week.</p>
<p>VIHA's first mass-immunization clinic, in donated space at Westshore Town Centre, went smoothly yesterday, with hundreds of people vaccinated.</p>
<p>"It's been fantastic -- we've got through hundreds and hundreds of people and everyone seems really happy," said Sandra Herbison, manager of public health units.</p>
<p>Volunteers staffed tables to meet people as they entered. Security guards assigned times for people to come back and line up, and numbers were distributed.</p>
<p>The result was that nobody had to wait for hours in line outside, unless they showed up prior to the clinic's scheduled 1 p.m. opening.</p>
<p>Previous clinics in much smaller spaces earlier in the week ended up with people standing in line, in some cases for hours, before being turned away.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Melissa Ngawati showed up with her two children, Kiri, 8, and Quinn, 10, at 11 a.m. and called her husband, Tony, to join them when it looked as if they were about to be admitted to the building. The entire family is asthmatic, so they were on the eligible list.</p>
<p>Ngawati said the time in line was made bearable by a donation of baked treats from a nearby Cob's Bakery for those waiting. "I think they've done really well -- it's really well organized."</p>
<p>The federal government said it was informed by Canada's H1N1 vaccine manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, that the vaccine supply will be lower next week because its facility only has one production line for two types of vaccine -- one for pregnant women and one for everyone else.</p>
<p>The mass clinic at Westshore Town Centre continues today.</p>

<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach is defending the hours-long lineups people in his province are facing to get the H1N1 vaccine as news emerged Thursday that another person from the Calgary area had died with H1N1.</p>
<p>Stelmach said the long lineups being faced by those looking for the vaccine are a result of the province's decision to make the vaccine immediately available to all residents, not just to high-risk groups.</p>
<p>"This is a serious matter. We're doing the best we can, right across Canada," Stelmach said. "Overall, people are pleased that we do have the vaccine and we're offering it to all Albertans."</p>
<p>Stelmach noted a limited vaccine supply means fewer clinics in the first week of the immunization campaign.</p>
<p>"We're getting as much of the vaccine as possible," the premier said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials said Thursday that another person from the Calgary area had died with H1N1.</p>
<p>Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health for Calgary, confirmed the death.</p>
<p>"It's a Calgary-area resident," she said. "It's an adult male."</p>
<p>She offered no further details.</p>
<p>Alberta has now recorded 13 deaths linked to H1N1, four of them since Friday.</p>
<p>The province's vaccination program has been heavily criticized for long lineups, and only a handful of clinics in Calgary and Edmonton to serve the province's two largest cities.</p>
<p>Jurisdictions outside Alberta have been encouraging only high-risk individuals to get the vaccine in the early days of the vaccination effort.</p>
<p>Those considered most at risk for H1N1 are health-care professionals, pregnant women, the elderly, the chronically ill and young children between six months and five years of age.</p>
<p>According to Alberta Health Services' latest H1N1 pandemic response plan, the new strain of influenza could affect a quarter of the population -- about 875,000 Albertans -- during the second wave this fall and winter.</p>
<p>This worst-case scenario could result in the hospitalization of between 3,800 and 11,400 patients, of whom 15 to 25 per cent are expected to need intensive care.</p>
<p>The health board's pandemic plan also suggests H1N1 could contribute to between 130 and 400 deaths in Alberta, compared with roughly 17 deaths annually due to seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>Opposition parties have raised questions about whether Alberta's health system can cope with the worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>"Alberta's major hospitals and intensive-care units are routinely at 100 per cent capacity," Liberal Leader David Swann said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Failure to ensure appropriate staffing levels to accommodate for a public health outbreak has left the system unable to cope," added NDP Leader Brian Mason. "It creates serious doubts about Alberta's capacity to cope with any health emergency."</p>
<p>But Health Minister Ron Liepert said the medical system is weathering the added strain of H1N1.</p>
<p>"Clearly, across the province, we are having obvious signs that the number of cases of H1N1 is increasing. That's not surprising. We expected that," he said this week.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said city emergency rooms have been so busy, medical staff have been moved from other areas of the hospital to help.</p>

</p>
<p>As the problem with distributing the H1N1 vaccine now shows us, solutions in health care don't come easily.</p>
<p>And as the Saskatchewan Party government's potential solution to surgical waiting lists shows us, solutions don't come cheaply, either.</p>
<p>And were both issues not problematic enough, there's always the complicating factor of politicians inserting themselves into the health-care delivery debate.</p>
<p>In fairness, both Saskatchewan Party Health Minister Don McMorris and NDP Opposition health critic Judy Junor -- notwithstanding their eagerness to snipe at each other at the legislature -- both seemed to have Saskatchewan patients' interests at heart in their somewhat opposing positions on these critical health issues.</p>
<p>McMorris insisted he is leaving the administration of the H1N1 vaccine to the professionals working under the medical health officer. Meanwhile, he has appointed Dr. Mark O'Grady (a member of the Saskatchewan Surgical Care Network) and Dr. Chris Vuksic (chief medical officer for the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region) to head what appears will be a broad-based surgical care working group -- an indication that politics is one step removed from these critical day-to-day health-care decisions.</p>
<p>There again, maybe there's always a bit of a reason to worry as long as politicians in need of getting elected every four years are controlling the purse strings. And maybe there's further reason to worry when the information we are getting from health professionals seems inconsistent at best and contradictory at worst.</p>
<p>Let's begin with the H1N1 issue, where little other than condolences can be expressed to those hoping for clear, concise guidance.</p>
<p>Perhaps compounding the confusion was the H1N1 debate among the politicians at the legislature this week. Junor advocated targeting H1N1 hotspots like the University of Saskatchewan to stop vulnerable young adults from getting and spreading the disease. McMorris said those most potentially susceptible to getting H1N1 should be targeted first. But in fairness to the politicians, such issues can be exceedingly complex.</p>
<p>While McMorris's solution does sound like it makes more sense than running around the province with a limited supply of vaccine and trying to put out fires, it also seems to make sense to stop the spread of H1N1 at the biggest university in the province. Moreover, given that health professionals in different health districts initially seemed to have very different ideas as to who the most "at-risk" patients are, it appears that there may be legitimate disagreement among the professionals as to how to deal with this issue.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer Moira McKinnon announced Thursday afternoon a provincewide protocol for first giving the vaccine to potentially high-risk groups, now defined as children between six months and five years and pregnant women past the 20-week stage.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that Saskatchewan won't be receiving as many H1N1 vaccine doses as it hoped next week. That said, there simply never seems to be enough resources to deal with health issues, as seems evident in McMorris's ambitious goal to reduce surgical waiting times to no more than three months within four years.</p>
<p>While McMorris is promising an undisclosed big financial commitment to meet this goal and while O'Grady and Vuksic explained to reporters Thursday that much can be done, either through more efficient use of surgical theatres in Saskatchewan or simply by re-examining the wait lists to better determine if all surgeries are necessary, everyone seems to be conceding that more will have to be done to meet this goal.</p>
<p>Certainly, one of the things being contemplated (an issue that actually first came up in the B.C. legislature Wednesday) is flying Saskatchewan patients in need of hip and knee replacements to B.C. to have the procedure done their at what would be a premium cost to Saskatchewan taxpayers. (While McMorris initially said he had no knowledge of this, officials later confirmed there have at least been preliminary discussions.)</p>
<p>Herein lies the problem in health care. The solutions are never cheap or easy.</p>
<p>And try as politicians might, there's always an element of politics.</p>

<p>Here's some H1N1 information from www.fighflu.ca[http://www.fighflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you'll be able to find much more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza which is different than the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions and pregnant women may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus - also known as human swine influenza - is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>How is it spread?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches their mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Contagiousness</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomitting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of your hand</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health care provider.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>Vaccination</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Clinics expand despite vaccine shortfall; H1N1 flu outbreak: Clinic locations and schedule / PAGE A12</b>
</div><div>Pamela Cowan   </div>
<div>Leader-Post</div>
<div>822 words</div><div>30 October 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan government has added to the list of those eligible to receive H1N1 flu shots next week, despite receiving less of the vaccine than expected.</p>
<p>As of this week, the province has received 124,000 fewer doses of vaccine than expected.</p>
<p>Even so, medical officials have decided to begin vaccinating women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant beginning next week. Previously, the program had been scheduled to expand to include only children under the age of five.</p>
<p>"We found out that the (vaccine) supplies were reduced about three days ago," said Dr. Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer. "We're not sure why."</p>
<p>All provinces have seen their allocations reduced.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan vaccination program began with health workers, who began receiving vaccinations this week and will continue to be eligible. An estimated 80-90 per cent have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>A decision is expected by the middle of next week on a further expansion of the vaccination program to include others deemed to be at higher risk, such as those with chronic heart and lung problems. As well, all pregnant women are expected to be included in this group. Depending on vaccine supplies, shots for this group could begin Nov. 9.</p>
<p>People seeking vaccinations will not be required to produce proof of a medical condition. McKinnon said officials are relying on people not to lie about their health in order to jump the queue. However, there will be no formal enforcement process in place.</p>
<p>"We have to trust people," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>Officials hope to begin vaccinations for the general population in mid-November.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of infections continues to climb. Between 30-40 new cases of H1N1 are confirmed by laboratory tests each day.</p>
<p>More and more people who believe they might have the flu are seeking out medical help.</p>
<p>So far, emergency rooms in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region have been able to cope with the increasing number of patients showing up with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>On Tuesday of this week, about 10 per cent of the 157 patients treated at the Regina General Hospital's emergency room had flu-like symptoms. By Wednesday, the proportion had doubled. The Pasqua Hospital saw an increase during the same period, though the number of patients was much smaller: seven complaining of the flu Tuesday, compared with 10 on Wednesday. The Pasqua treats a total of about 100 emergency patients each day.</p>
<p>The General is adding two staff members to the emergency ward to help out.</p>
<p>Part of the increased workload is from workers seeking sick notes for their employers. Hospital officials are urging such patients not to go to the emergency departments.</p>
<p>Patients with flu-like symptoms are being streamed away from those with other emergencies in an effort to limit the spread of the illness, said Mark Torjusen, spokesman with the health region.</p>
<p>Most patients who are appearing at Regina's emergency rooms have mild flu symptoms, but many are asking to be tested for the H1N1 influenza, he said. Tests are not available on demand, and are performed only when deemed medically necessary.</p>
<p>More people are also seeking help from home.</p>
<p>Calls to the provincially operated HealthLine, a telephone service offering medical advice, have also taken a big jump. The service is now handling about 700 calls day, up from a typical load of 400. The health ministry attributes the increase solely to H1N1.</p>
<p>What are being described as "tactical" staffing changes are on the way to help deal with the increased number of calls. Even so, callers are being asked to avoid calling during peak times at mid-morning and first thing in the afternoon.</p>
<p>McKinnon says family doctors are so far coping with the increased flu workload. If they become overwhelmed, the province has contingency plans to set up special assessment clinics to handle flu patients. Earlier this week, the hard-hit Sun Country Health Region in southeast Saskatchewan began using such a clinic.</p>
<p>H1N1 QUESTION OF THE DAY</p>
<p>QUESTION:</p>
<p>When are people with H1N1 flu infectious?</p>
<p>ANSWER:</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health says people infected with either the seasonal or H1N1 flu virus may be able to infect others from one day before showing symptoms up to seven days after symptoms develop. This can be longer in some people, especially children or people with weakened immune systems. This is why vaccination is such an important tool in preventing the spread of H1N1, since it provides you with immunity to the illness and prevents you from potentially infecting others.</p>

<p>Re: Long Lines Expected At Flu Clinics, Oct. 29</p>
<p>The main reason for long lines as well as delays in administering the H1N1 vaccine is that the process is run by government bureaucrats. Having private industry take over would no doubt cut down on administrative costs, create more venues for vaccinations and make the whole operation much smoother. Would this cost the public money? Yes it would, but with the exception of the disabled and the destitute, what is wrong with paying around $10 per person? Most people would not object and this would ultimately reduce the number of severe cases that may occur due to typical government bungling.</p>

</div><div>The StarPhoenix</div>

</p>
<p>Not for the first time, the scene Thursday on the floor of the House of Commons was more pathos than drama.</p>
<p>There was Industry Minister Tony Clement, pleading with the Liberal party to forgo its role as official Opposition and help the government to battle H1N1.</p>
<p>However, the Liberals, low in poll numbers but in high dudgeon, continued to lambaste the government for being too slow to get mass vaccinations for H1N1 underway and too inept to provide information on how, when, where and why Canadians should roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>This bit of theatrics was pathetic for more than its fake plea for unity. It was particularly sad for its portrayal of one of the most serious flaws in Canada's -- and the world's -- plans to fight the next major pandemic.</p>
<p>It isn't the science that is weak, although more could be done to strengthen the facilities charged with identifying threats and manufacturing vaccines. And health officials from around the world have been able co-operate in sharing information and technology, so the weakness isn't there.</p>
<p>The greatest threat to the system is the seemingly irresistible urge of politicians, sham scientists, narcissistic stars and basement-dwelling conspiracy theorists to try to gain notoriety by panicking the ignorant and the wilful ignorance of so many "plugged-in" citizens.</p>
<p>That was made clear with the release this week of two polls that indicated at least half those Canadian who will get the chance to protect themselves from H1N1 say they will refuse to be inoculated.</p>
<p>At the best of times -- even when people are well-enough informed on the risks of the disease verses the risk of the vaccine -- public health officials enter every pandemic in a no-win situation. If they identify the infection immediately, quickly produce a vaccine and get a massive buy-in from the public, it creates the appearances of an overreaction because the disease doesn't get an opportunity to spread widely.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that, when it comes to an infection such as the flu, nothing is more effective than a vaccination. To be sure, one should be taking precautions such as washing hands thoroughly and not letting commonly touched items to remain dirty. However, influenza is typically airborne, which means -- unless one can stop breathing -- the best protection is to build up one's immune system, the job of the vaccines.</p>
<p>But if, as it seems to be the case in Canada, citizens become skeptical about the veracity of the message from the government or public health officials and refuse to get inoculated, the spread of the disease can be quick and potentially devastating. Again the blame will fall on the public health system for not getting the message out and for failing to have adequate vaccine in the right place at the right time.</p>
<p>But the situation is different for the conspiracy theorists.</p>
<p>For them, if the disease turns out to be less virulent than feared, as so far appears to be the case with H1N1, they claim health officials were fearmongering. If it is deadlier than expected, the public health officials let things got out of control. And if a single person dies from the vaccine, or as the statistics suggest, one in 1.5 million develops Guillain-Barré Syndrome (a neurological condition that can cause temporary paralysis), or one in 700,000 has a serious allergic reaction, it's proof the public health officials are out to kill us all.</p>
<p>Forget the already abundant evidence that this flu strain kills at a high rate (87 Canadians have died already from H1N1, with the infection just getting started), that millions are expected to become sick and thousands forced into hospitals if a significant proportion of the population isn't vaccinated in time.</p>
<p>By all accounts, the H1N1 outbreak this winter won't claim as many victims as the regular influenza virus, although it will target more otherwise-healthy people. It will, however, challenge health officials and politicians, who will be taken to task simultaneously for trying to mislead the public, downplaying the seriousness of the illness, or poisoning people in order to secure contracts for drug companies.</p>
<p>And that could well be the biggest threat from this outbreak. Ignorance, finger-pointing and panic seem to be in much greater supply in Canada these days than the vaccine needed to protect against H1N1.</p>

<p>Too many people with moderate or mild influenza-like symptoms are using the emergency room, the Saskatoon Health Region says.</p>
<p>As the expected second wave of the H1N1 flu hits the population, more people are exhibiting flu-like symptoms and showing up at the city's three emergency departments when they don't have to, said two health region doctors at a press conference Thursday.</p>
<p>"You don't need to go to the ER to get a sick note," said deputy medical health officer Dr. Johnmark Opondo. "We want to see severe cases. Using the ER judiciously is a wise choice."</p>
<p>In the last several days, the health region has seen a steady increase in the number of people with influenza-like symptoms using the ER.</p>
<p>The health region recommends people with flu-like symptoms use the emergency departments in extreme cases, such as those people with underlying medical conditions or women who are pregnant.</p>
<p>Also, people displaying serious symptoms such as a high fever, bad headache, shortness of breath, diarrhea or vomiting should use the emergency departments.</p>
<p>Patients with flu-like symptoms are isolated from others waiting for a physician in hospitals.</p>
<p>"People who are healthy and have the flu -- they have the flu," said Dr. James Stempien, head of emergency medicine for the health region, adding physicians are testing for H1N1 only in extreme cases.</p>
<p>"If people come in and they have the flu, they have H1N1. It's a waste of time because we're not testing people (for H1N1) unless they've been admitted to ICU or in special cases."</p>
<p>The health region has made plans in the event that health-care workers in city hospitals are overwhelmed by patients with influenza inquiries.</p>
<p>First, the health region would set aside space in clinics and dedicate physicians' time to influenza treatment. If that doesn't satisfy demand, the health region will establish "independent assessment clinics," said Opondo.</p>
<p>In most cases of mild or moderate symptoms, self-isolation is the best course of action. Prevention -- handwashing, immunization, coughing and sneezing into elbows and consistent surface cleaning -- is the best line of defence.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has received 112,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccination. Health-care workers started to receive the vaccine on Monday.</p>
<p>BEARDY'S STUDENTS SENT HOME</p>
<p>Two schools on the Beardy's and Okemasis First Nation were closed Thursday as a number of students were exhibiting flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The elementary and high schools are closed until Monday as staff clean the school and install hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>"This is precautionary so we can clean the school and give the kids a chance to fight back and stop the spread," said an employee of Constable Robin Cameron Education Complex High School.</p>
<p>Chief and council recommended the schools be shut down, affecting about 350 students.</p>

</p>
<p>There is something hard-wired in the Saskatchewan psyche that we're obedient people who will obligingly stand in line and patiently wait our turn when the government tells us to. Most of the time this is good -- at least for those doing the telling. And it helps explain some of the nation's historically longest surgical waiting lists.</p>
<p>As Canada embarks on the H1N1 flu vaccination campaign, the largest of its sort in a generation, Saskatchewan people are being told once more to be both patient and obedient. But this time there should be some public push back.</p>
<p>Like every province, Saskatchewan ordered the H1N1 vaccine -- enough apparently to cover 75 per cent of the population -- and shipments began arriving this week at the same time that vaccinations began. In all provinces, the vaccination priority is health-care employees, people at health risk and certain population and ethnic groups living in the inner city and in remote communities.</p>
<p>But in virtually every province, except Saskatchewan, mass immunization clinics are now underway where people are urged to respect the priority lists. No one is being turned away, but people are being asked to use common sense and discretion to let vulnerable patients and health employees go first.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan this is unthinkable. Why allow personal judgment and choice when the government and health regions can protect us from ourselves by scheduling who can get vaccinated and when?</p>
<p>This week the only people allowed to be vaccinated in Saskatchewan were health region employees, including many non-front-line health workers who are closer to computers than patients. This closed shop approach, while well intentioned, resulted in many other people with seriously compromised health, who should have received priority alongside nurses and doctors, not being vaccinated.</p>
<p>Under the Saskatchewan model, there is a tiered approach, starting with this week's health employee vaccination. Monday there will be two full weeks of clinics restricted to five categories of high-risk groups. Only during the week of Nov. 16 will general mass immunization clinics be underway -- three weeks later than everywhere else in the country -- and in Saskatoon tens of thousands of people will descend on Prairieland Park and several inner city schools.</p>
<p>In neighbouring B.C., Alberta and Manitoba, full-scale immunization clinics are underway. Here, we're being told to wait because they don't want lineups and there is only so much of the vaccine to go around.</p>
<p>Early this week, with its first-come, first-served honour system, Alberta had horrendous lineups and some clinics ran out of vaccine. But today there are 1,100 sites in Alberta that are vaccinating anyone who drops in and, along with B.C., Alberta is allowing pharmacies to vaccinate for H1N1. In Manitoba, vaccine clinics are open to the general public and the vaccine is also being distributed to doctors' offices.</p>
<p>Rather than allowing vaccinations in pharmacies or permitting private nursing companies to get it into businesses and large facilities, we're doing the government knows best structured approach.</p>
<p>Although I'd like to pin this Saskatchewan bureaucratic tendency on a particular political ideology -- as I'm wont to do on many regressive social characteristics -- it is more than that. It's the deeper, embedded mentality of health-care bureaucrats that seeks central planning, scheduling, categorization, rule making and micro-managing.</p>
<p>Thanks to these tiered vaccination schedules, moms and dads of vulnerable kids may be able to get their children vaccinated in the next two weeks but will have to wait for their own shots until later, when the "general" clinics open; EMTs and paramedics get vaccinated with health workers, but what of police officers and firefighters? Ditto for the husbands of pregnant women.</p>
<p>When increasingly young people are the focus of H1N1, no provisions are made for school-wide vaccinations -- never mind teachers who need immunization -- and the earliest that clinics will appear at the University of Saskatchewan and SIAST is the end of November and early December.</p>
<p>Health care is bringing back the old Saskatchewan motto: Go small or go home.</p>

<p>Windsor Fire and Rescue Services has stopped conducting tours of its fire halls because of concern about the spread of flu and the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Effective immediately, the fire department has also suspended all in-person educational and public relations events.</p>
<p>Chief fire prevention officer Lee Tome said the health of Windsor's firefighters takes precedence over outreach activities.</p>
<p>The department will resume tours and public events when it deems the threat of contracting the flu has diminished.</p>

<p>Windsor is not receiving enough doses of the H1N1 vaccine to keep up with unexpected demand at local flu shot clinics, where massive lineups have forced staff to turn people away.</p>
<p>"We don't have as much as we need," Dr. Allen Heimann said Thursday afternoon after the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit received another 2,200 multi-dose vials of the vaccine. "We are packaging it and trying to send it out as quickly as we can."</p>
<p>The health unit initially received 18,000 doses of the vaccine from Health Canada, which only covers about four per cent of the Windsor-Essex population. Shortly after the second public H1N1 clinic opened in Windsor Thursday, people who did not belong to the high-risk groups were being turned away. Previously, the health unit had said no one would be denied the shot as long as there was enough vaccine.</p>
<p>After standing in line for three hours, Lori Bradley and her 10-year-old son Dylan were turned away once they got inside the clinic Thursday in a South Windsor Knights of Columbus hall.</p>
<p>"I'm mad. I'm very mad," said Bradley who wanted her son to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"The reason I brought him was all the stuff on TV. Children dying. They've got the parents so scared," Bradley said. "People are standing here for three hours. It's ridiculous."</p>
<p>When the clinic opened at 2 p.m., a health care worker said they wanted high-risk people to get the vaccine, but wouldn't turn people away.</p>
<p>By about 2:30 p.m., Deb Bennett, director of health protection at the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit, started walking down the line of people that stretched from the hall down Northwood Street to South Cameron Boulevard, to say people not in the high-risk groups would not be vaccinated Thursday. There were more than 500 people in line by that time.</p>
<p>At-risk groups include people with chronic conditions under the age of 65, pregnant women and children between six months and five years old.</p>
<p>"I know it's hard and I know you've been through a long lineup," Bennett told people waiting in line. "We are asking people who are not at risk to please go home. We are running out of vaccine."</p>
<p>At one point, Bennett used a police loudspeaker to get out the message. With police also helping to spread the word, some people left.</p>
<p>"I'm kind of ticked off," said Lisa Morneau, who was leaving without getting her children, 6 and 8, vaccinated.</p>
<p>"When are they going to get it? Are they going to get it?"</p>
<p>Barbara Cheifetz, who was trying to get her 16-year-old daughter Jordanna vaccinated, said she was annoyed. "They should have come out way earlier and told us to leave," she said.</p>
<p>Margaret Sandford, 67, said she was at the hall by 9 a.m. She said she has multiple sclerosis and other health problems and wore a mask to avoid germs.</p>
<p>"I don't mind as long as I can get the shot," she said of her five-hour wait.</p>
<p>The chaos and confusion is not limited to Windsor. Across the province, thousands of people have been lining up for the H1N1 shot -- some for as long as seven or eight hours. Many were turned away because the vaccine supply ran out or the clinic staff couldn't see everyone in time. One Ontario community that seems to have a good handle on the situation is Sault Ste. Marie, where H1N1 shots are being given by appointment.</p>
<p>At a news conference earlier Thursday, Heimann discussed the possibility of opening a weekend clinic and a clinic for pregnant women only, but those would depend on vaccine availability. The next public H1N1 clinic will be held Monday at Leamington Half Century on 160 Talbot St. E., from 1 until 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Heimann couldn't say how many family physicians are now able to administer the vaccine in their offices, but at least one Windsor doctor's order has been postponed.</p>
<p>Dr. Albert Ng, past president of the Essex County Medical Society, said he was supposed to pick up his allotment of the vaccine today from the health unit, but was told Thursday that would not happen.</p>
<p>"They are really making it difficult for physicians to administer the vaccine," Ng said. "There are making people wait in line (at the flu clinics) but it would be much easier if doctors could do it in their offices. This is affecting patient care."</p>
<p>Another Windsor doctor, Albert Schumacher, on the other hand, has received his vaccine order and will be giving it to at-risk patients in his practice.</p>
<p>Doctors wishing to administer the H1N1 vaccine in their offices must meet certain criteria, such as having proper storage and refrigeration facilities, said family physician Dr. Gary Ing, who hasn't ordered any doses yet.</p>
<p>There is a lot of paperwork and meticulous record-keeping involved in the process, he said, and doctors must sign an agreement that calls for immunization of at-risk groups first.</p>
<p>Ing has been fielding calls from concerned patients all week and said many of them are confused by the constantly changing information about H1N1.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, local hospitals are dealing with a spike in emergency room visits this week. Both Windsor Regional Hospital and Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital reported seeing more than 200 patients in their ERs on Wednesday alone.</p>
<p>Jamie Cloutier, a 17-year-old Belle River high school student, was among the suspected H1N1 cases at Hotel-Dieu and she remained in an ER bed Thursday morning, wearing a mask and waiting for her test results with dad Michael by her side.</p>
<p>"It feels just like the regular flu," Cloutier said, listing cough and fever among her symptoms.</p>
<p>She was given antiviral drugs and told it would be several days before she could go back to school.</p>
<p>Cloutier didn't know where she may have picked up the virus, but said another student at Belle River was recently sick with the flu and had to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>VACCINES FOR HEALTH STAFF</p>
<p>The health unit is joining forces with Windsor's two hospital to provide H1N1 vaccines to all health care workers in the region.</p>
<p>Health care providers who work outside the hospitals, such as nursing home staff, will now be able to get their flu shots at Windsor Regional Hospital or Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital. The goal is to immunize health care workers as quickly as possible and keep them healthy since they are at a high risk of catching H1N1 from their patients and clients and spreading it to others. Health officials also hope the move will alleviate some of the pressure on overwhelmed public flu clinics.</p>
<p>"We are facing a possible crisis," said WRH CEO David Musyj. "As a hospital, we would be fooling ourselves if we thought we could handle (a pandemic) alone. That's why we need to band together."</p>
<p>Both hospitals have been steadily immunizing their own doctors, nurses and staff this week.</p>

<p>Monty Python made dismemberment fun with the Black Knight character who guards a tiny bridge for unknown reasons.</p>
<p>As his limbs are hacked off one by one, he claims invincibility. It's absurd. Now, so too is the Canucks' injury situation. It's as ridiculous as the Holy Grail, but without any of the fun.</p>
<p>Alex Bolduc became the tenth Canuck this season -- remember, it's just four weeks old -- to be felled by injury. He left the ice in Thursday's second period with his arm lifelessly dangling. When it was over, his arm was in a sling. You can probably count him out for tonight.</p>
<p>The injury bug is so bad it's making H1N1 look good. Even the injury replacements are getting hurt.</p>
<p>Of course, the Canucks, much like the Black Knight, have continued to fight as best they can. The only difference on Thursday was they won. They stole one in a 2-1 shootout win which ended when Mikael Samuelsson beat Jonathan Quick.</p>
<p>Undermanned, they made due. That's all they can do right now, while they hope that if they can get through this stretch they can turn things around and go on a run with a healthy lineup. The problem is, the stretch keeps getting longer.</p>
<p>"It was greasy," Ryan Kesler said. "We need to win games like these. It was greasy, but it was a good win.</p>
<p>"Lately we've been losing a guy it seems like every game to injury. It's tough, but I think management did a great job of building our team with depth. That's one of our greatest strengths. When guys do go down, we do have other guys who can step in."</p>
<p>But who's left? Tonight, it should mean Darcy Hordichuk will check back into the lineup.</p>
<p>Whether defenceman Aaron Rome stays on as a so-called forward remains to be seen.</p>
<p>The Canucks accomplished their goals in L.A. They stifled the highest-scoring team in the Western Conference and suffocated the NHL's highest-scoring player, Anze Kopitar. They did it by icing their projected top-six defensive unit for the first time this year. Thinking that may not even be enough, they also dipped into the Dave King playbook. As King did often in Columbus, Vancouver head coach Alain Vigneault put three defencemen on the ice at the same time to match up with Kopitar's line. Rome was the extra D-man. He was listed as a forward but that was in name only.</p>
<p>The results were somewhat predictable.</p>
<p>The Kings couldn't generate much and the Canucks' offence made less noise than some mutes. A thriller, it was not. A street mime seen in downtown L.A. in the afternoon was more entertaining.</p>
<p>Fortunately, for the Canucks they were as efficient as they were safe. When the first period ended, the Kings held every advantage in play, notably outshooting Vancouver</p>
<p>12--4. But the game was tied 1-1.</p>
<p>Scott Parse put the Kings up 1-0 when he scored the first goal of his career. It was a beauty which he launched from the top of the slot. It went over Raycroft, who never had a chance at stopping it.</p>
<p>The Canucks finally responded 18:36 into the first when their top line of Mikael Samuelsson, Henrik Sedin and Alex Burrows made their best shift of the game count. It was Sedin who did the work along the side boards, before finding Burrows behind the Kings' net. Burrows sent a partially blind pass into the slot and Samuelsson drove it into the net for the sixth goal of his career.</p>
<p>Raycroft was solid after that. He had a scare early when a long Kopitar shot beat him, but then hit the post. It was the only play he had a hard time with. His best play came in the third with 11:31 left when he lunged to poke check Edward Purcell who was on a partial breakaway.</p>
<p>The Canucks were better, and that's a relative term, in the second. They did generate a couple of chances, the best from Mason Raymond who did what he does best -- beat a couple of defencemen with his speed, charged the net and failed to score.</p>

<p>There is no need for the average healthy person to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>I'd rather become ill with H1N1 than to put that vaccine in my body. There is no need for me to protect the "vulnerable" because the vulnerable will be vaccinated.</p>
<p>I have a close friend who is a nurse and who is exposed to H1N1 every day. She has two kids and is refusing the vaccine. The fact that 50 per cent of Canadians don't plan to be vaccinated has not caught the attention of the medical community so much as it has caught the attention of business men.</p>

<p>To letter writer Lloyd Creech, who suggests health-care workers who refuse H1N1 vaccinations be kept away from medical facilities, I would reply "no."</p>
<p>I and many other health-care workers are unsure about receiving the vaccine, not because we want to spread the flu but because of our healthy skepticism. We want valid research that confirms its safety. It isn't wise to put a foreign substance in our body just because the media says so or because everyone else is doing it.</p>
<p>We can stay in medical facilities as long as we don't have the symptoms. We are not trying to help spread H1N1, as anybody can spread the virus who touches public objects and shares the air we breathe.</p>

<p>With medical health officials warning that there could be a shortage of H1N1 flu vaccine, people who managed to get a shot Thursday at Vancouver's Renfrew Community Centre were relieved.</p>
<p>Others, who missed their vaccination -- because the makeshift clinic in the Renfrew Heights area of the city closed at 3 p.m. sharp -- plan to go to other locations as soon as possible to avoid the shortfall.</p>
<p>Vancouver's Caitlin Anderson, who has a chronic disease, said she was glad she got the shot just before the clinic closed.</p>
<p>"I have asthma and the normal flu almost kills me, so the H1N1 flu would make me horribly sick," said Anderson, who uses a wheelchair. "I just get sick very easily, just because of my asthma and other medical conditions. I'm 25 and like a prime victim age-wise for this thing."</p>
<p>She's hoping everyone who wants the vaccine can get it: "Any tool is good to fight something that could cause you harm."</p>
<p>Anderson got the regular seasonal flu shot, then the H1N1 shot which ,she says, "you feel more than the regular one. And [the nurse] told me my arm might hurt for a couple of days."</p>
<p>Ling Zhu of Vancouver is eager to have herself and her 21/2-year-old son, who has had heart surgery, vaccinated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Zhu's parents brought the toddler to be vaccinated, but were told the mother had to be present for the shot to be administered.</p>
<p>Zhu, who was working, arrived at the clinic 3:01 and she and her son were turned away.</p>
<p>"I missed it by just one minute," Zhu said. "My parents and son had to wait here for three hours already. They ask me to come here.</p>
<p>"I don't want to get a fever and be sick," said Zhu. "I have many friends who get it already. They get a fever and they think it's H1N1."</p>
<p>Zhu said she'll keep trying.</p>
<p>Vancouver Coastal Health is holding another H1N1 and seasonal flu immunization clinic today at Pacific Spirit Community Health Centre (2110 W. 43rd Ave.) from 1:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m.</p>

<p>Health Minister Don McMorris said Wednesday the province will receive fewer H1N1 vaccination doses next week than it originally hoped.</p>
<p>The doses continue to be distributed by the federal government to the provinces on a per-capita basis, but there is less available from the supplier, meaning Saskatchewan will get 60,000 shots rather than the 100,000 to 110,000 it had originally expected.</p>
<p>It has already received 112,000 doses, with vaccinations having begun Monday for health-care workers.</p>
<p>The NDP said a flu outbreak at the University of Saskatchewan suggests the province needs to be more flexible in its delivery of the vaccine.</p>
<p>Opposition health critic Judy Junor said a vaccination clinic should be considered on campus.</p>
<p>"You have sort of a population that is in fairly tight quarters, using the same showers and bathrooms. . . . They are going to spread it faster and young people are at risk for getting serious complications, so I think you have to look at that," she told reporters at the legislature after raising the issue in question period.</p>
<p>McMorris said the province will stick with its existing vaccination strategy.</p>
<p>"Our priorities, as were set out earlier, is we want to do all the health-care providers this first week and then move into the high-risk groups.</p>
<p>"It's extremely important that we stay on that path and do those high-risk groups. . . . Many of the fatalities have had underlying medical conditions," he told reporters.</p>
<p>The strategy could be changed on the advice of medical health officers and the federal government, said McMorris.</p>
<p>But McMorris also faced questions over the differences among health regions in administering the vaccine.</p>
<p>Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region will begin vaccinations for children between six months and four years next week, while Saskatoon Health Region will begin on Nov. 9 to vaccinate children between six months and five years, along with persons under 65 with chronic conditions, individuals living in remote and isolated communities and household contacts and care providers of persons at high risk who cannot be immunized.</p>
<p>McMorris said the rollout of vaccinations is the responsibility of the health regions, which have different needs.</p>
<p>U of- outbreak</p>
<p>The suspected H1N1 outbreak has affected at least six students living in residence on the University of Saskatchewan campus.</p>
<p>David Hannah, associate vice-president of student and enrolment services for the university, says the U of- has two confirmed cases of H1N1 and, based on the symptoms, four others are also suspected as having H1N1.</p>
<p>"We have reports (from faculty members) coming in from all across campus that people are going home with influenza-like symptoms."</p>
<p>Hannah says university administration has been working with administrative and academic units on a plan since May to deal with a possible outbreak.</p>
<p>"We've made it a key priority," said Hannah. "There was a meeting in the student residence on Monday with all the students where we reinforced the message. Students were taught to recognize the symptoms of H1N1, proper hand-washing and coughing techniques."</p>
<p>Hannah said students have also been told to stay home if they are experiencing symptoms.</p>
<p>"Food services on campus will deliver hot meals to (students) in their room" if they are sick, Hannah said.</p>
<p>He said the detailed plan, which can be found at www.usask.ca/pandemic[http://www.usask.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/pandemic], includes enhanced cleaning and disinfection procedures across campus and the installation of 285 hand sanitizer stations.</p>
<p>"We're doing everything we can to keep this to a minimum," said Hannah.</p>

<p>As the province begins Day 4 of H1N1 vaccinations, some communities in Alberta are questioning why they are still without access to the pandemic flu shot.</p>
<p>The issue comes as several communities in the south--including Lethbridge and Medicine Hat--ran out of the H1N1 shots in the first two days of opening their clinics earlier this week. The clinics have since been resupplied.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Tory MLA Genia Leskiw, MLA for Bonnyville-Cold Lake, said some residents in her riding are getting antsy about when the vaccine will arrive in northern Alberta.</p>
<p>"Today there's an onslaught of phone calls about it because they're not quite sure exactly when a vaccine is going to arrive in Bonnyville and Cold Lake," she said.</p>
<p>"The clinics are saying they're coming, but we're just not sure when."</p>
<p>Chestermere learned only Wednesday that its clinic's planned opening date was Nov. 2, said Mayor Patricia Matthews.</p>
<p>In the meantime, some Chestermere residents who came to Calgary to get their shots left frustrated by the long lines, Matthews said.</p>
<p>"We've had several of our seniors that have gone out to Strathmore and into Calgary and have experienced extremely long waits," said Matthews.</p>
<p>"Some in their 80s had to turn around."</p>
<p>Matthews said, however, the town is pleased it will eventually have its own clinic, which will also serve nearby communities.</p>
<p>Indeed, although the health superboard has opened numerous locations across the province where people can get the shot, not all small communities can expect their own H1N1 clinic.</p>
<p>"We get lots of complaints from small towns . . . they're worried they don't have a clinic in a town of 100 or 300," said Dr. Vivien Suttorp, medical officer of health for Alberta's south zone.</p>
<p>While some tiny communities in remote northern Alberta may get their own clinics, for example, residents at other locations should expect to have to drive to urban centres in the early days of the rollout, she said.</p>
<p>"These smaller communities, they have access to it similarly to where they pick up groceries, for example, in Lethbridge," said Suttorp.</p>
<p>"The biggest thing is that public health is doing their best, we're all in it together."</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said the province plans to eventually distribute the vaccine in some smaller centres located far from Calgary or Edmonton through family doctors and nearly 400 pharmacists certified to give the shot.</p>
<p>Liepert said he hopes doctors and pharmacists will begin receiving vaccine supplies next week.</p>
<p>"This is a massive undertaking and there are probably going to be situations where certain areas may not get it as quickly as other areas, but we have to recognize that there are a number of factors involved, including ensuring that they have adequate, trained people to administer the vaccine," Liepert said.</p>
<p>One of the factors is supply. The province expects to get its next batch of vaccine on Thursday.</p>
<p>"There's been a high demand and the manufacturing facility can only manufacture so much and so there is a balance here of supply and demand," the health minister said.</p>
<p>"Our goal should be that by early next week the vaccine should be available throughout the province within reasonable proximity."</p>
<p>Health officials were taken aback by the huge public demand for the vaccine in southern Alberta earlier this week.</p>
<p>Clinics in Vauxhall, Coaldale, Medicine Hat, Lethbridge and Magrath each ran out of vaccine on Monday and Tuesday, said Suttorp. A number of people who lined up were turned away before a fresh supply arrived in time for the clinics on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We worked across the province between Alberta Health Services zones to get some redistribution of the vaccine," said Suttorp.</p>
<p>"The issue was we didn't have enough vaccine in the south that was allocated here . . . all these things get tweaked as we go, day-by-day or sometimes hour-by-hour, as it was (on Tuesday)."</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services, meanwhile, is working on securing locations for an additional 10 vaccination clinics. The health minister said mobile clinics could also be dispatched to hot spots around the province.</p>
<p>Liepert said the priority in the early days is to immunize Albertans at the mass clinics established.</p>
<p>"There is a supply situation," Liepert said. "We have to ensure that we not only have supplies to meet the orders that physicians might request, but also adequate supplies to ensure that the clinics that we have up and running, where Albertans have become familiar with going to, have adequate supply."</p>
<p>The province isn't requiring family doctors to give the H1N1 shot. Liepert said it will be up to individual physicians to decide whether they want to offer the service.</p>
<p>While vaccine supply is an issue for the province in the first week of its immunization campaign, Liepert noted that native communities in Alberta already have enough vaccine to cover 50 per cent of their population.</p>
<p>"I'm told by our chief medical officer today that in many cases they've already run out, so that's a good news, bad news situation," Liepert said. "They run out, but the good news is they've actually vaccinated 50 per cent of their residents on the reserve.</p>
<p>"There's varying degrees of success," he added. "We just all have to be patient. We're only in Day 3."</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The National Hockey League is watching the progression of H1N1 cases among its players but at this point sees no need for special measures to help prevent spread of the illness.</p>
<p>The Washington Capitals confirmed yesterday that forward Quintin Laing is being treated for H1N1, making him at least the third NHL player to be diagnosed with it.</p>
<p>On Tuesday cases were confirmed for Edmonton Oilers' defenceman Ladislav Smid and Colorado Avalanche goalie Peter Budaj. New York Islanders' forward Doug Weight returned to the lineup yesterday after missing three games with H1N1.</p>
<p>"We have been regularly providing our clubs with updated information and recommendations as they become available," said the NHL said in a statement yesterday. "We have not mandated specific precautions or courses of action. The league is monitoring the progression of the flu, but have implemented no specific 'contingency plans' at this point in time. However, we will be prepared to do so should it become necessary."</p>
<p>The Capitals said no other players have shown symptoms of the swine flu and that Laing is being kept away from the rest of the team.</p>
<p>The Oilers took similar precautions with Smid, but the 23-year-old defenceman didn't miss a game.</p>
<p>The irony in the Oilers' dressing room is a half-dozen of Smid's teammates have been hit harder with a non-H1N1 variety of the flu, with Gilbert Brule missing three games so far, Mike Comrie two, and Ales Hemsky one.</p>
<p>"I guess I got lucky," Smid said.</p>

<p>Halloween tips to help kids avoid the flu</p>
<p>There may be something more frightening than ghosts and goblins this Halloween -- but with a little extra care it shouldn't be too scary.</p>
<p>Doctors say parties or communal candy bowls could contribute to the spread of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>But they also say with a little common sense children and parents should be able to avoid the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Anne Matlow, at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children, says first and foremost, kids who are not feeling well should stay home.</p>
<p>Children should also avoid eating anything that is not wrapped.</p>
<p>And they should also be cautious about reaching into a bowl to pull out treats, because a virus on one child's hand could end up on the candy picked up by another one.</p>
<p>Handwashing or using hand sanitizer can cut down the risk, she says.</p>
<p>"When you come home and want to sort through your candies, you should first wash your hands."</p>
<p>Gene therapy repaired lungs for transplant</p>
<p>Canadian scientists have, for the first time, used gene therapy to repair injured lungs from a deceased donor to make them potentially suitable for transplantation.</p>
<p>Only about 15 per cent of all donor lungs are healthy enough for transplant, and this technique could greatly increase the number of organs available for the life-saving surgery.</p>
<p>A team of researchers at University Health Network in Toronto has spent 10 years developing the gene therapy, which is injected into the donor lungs after their removal to a special ventilator unit.</p>
<p>Principal researcher Dr. Shaf Keshavjee says the treatment helps heal damaged cells in the lungs to make the organs healthy enough for transplant.</p>
<p>The researchers have successfully restored and transplanted lungs in animals and soon plan to begin human transplants as part of a clinical trial.</p>

<p>Re: 'Outbreaks 'spike' at city schools' (Oct. 27)</p>
<p>This outbreak was identified last spring and officials knew a second and more severe outbreak was due to hit this fall. Why didn't they start giving out the shot for H1N1 over the summer, before the kids went back to school and spread it around like oxygen, or shut down the schools until the shots were here and given?</p>
<p>A lot of children are sick and some have died. Schools are reporting record high absenteeism due to flu-like symptoms. We know schoolchildren are the biggest spreaders of any and every type of virus, especially the flu. The vast majority of these illnesses and deaths could have been avoided if people could just get the shots before the flu arrived rather than after it has come, done its worse, and left.</p>
<p>I know it would have messed with some people's summer vacation plans and/or parents would have to scramble to find child care in order to go to work, but we're talking about life and death here -- and plain common sense. Get the shots out before the virus gets out.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Swine flu is surging across Canada, with Ontario and Quebec now starting to catch up to the hard-hit western provinces, says the chief public health officer.</p>
<p>"At the moment, certainly the reports we're getting from Ontario, Quebec is that there is increasing activity," said Dr. David Butler-Jones yesterday.</p>
<p>"And certainly in the West, the vast majority of the positive tests ... are coming up with H1, which suggests that over the last two weeks we're starting to see an important increase.</p>
<p>"We're definitely in the next wave now."</p>
<p>Overall flu activity has been steadily increasing for several weeks, particularly in British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan and the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>A swine-flu outbreak that began in B.C.'s Lower Mainland has been creeping north for several weeks now, he said.</p>
<p>The Prairie provinces are also seeing an uptick in H1N1.</p>
<p>"Two, three weeks ago, the number of H1s amongst the tests for influenza-like illness were a tiny minority," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"Now it's increasing, which again suggests that H1 is the bulk of many of the infections there as well."</p>
<p>A southeastern Saskatchewan health region has opened a flu assessment site to ease the burden the virus is putting on emergency rooms.</p>
<p>In Ontario, children's hospitals in Toronto and Ottawa have been swamped recently as worried parents bring in their children over swine flu concerns.</p>
<p>Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children says it is seeing as many cases as it usually does during peak flu season, which tends to come much later in the year.</p>
<p>But most cases have been mild and children are being sent home with their parents.</p>
<p>Still, the virus appears to have even health-care workers skittish.</p>
<p>Though already big takers of seasonal flu shots, they are turning out in droves for the new H1N1 vaccine, said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>"My experience at (University Health Network) has been I have never seen people (health-care workers) want a flu shot so much in my life," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Atlantic provinces have seen "sporadic" H1N1 flu activity, Butler-Jones said. But, he adds, it's only a matter of time before swine-flu cases spike across the country.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't say sort of one province is worse than another," he said.</p>
<p>"We're very quickly moving to a setting where virtually all provinces and territories will be seeing an increase in cases."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sports organizers take precautions; Temporary ban on handshakes looms</b>
</div><div>Ken Peters  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>

</p>
<p>The next Hamilton victim of the H1N1 wave might be a gesture of sportsmanship as the flu continues to sweep through the area.</p>
<p>Basketball and soccer organizers are considering a temporary ban on the traditional post-game handshake as a preventive measure against the latest viral outbreak.</p>
<p>And the parents of Hamilton's 5,000 local hockey players are being told to make sure each player has his or her own water bottle and keep children home if they aren't feeling well.</p>
<p>The recent death of Etobicoke minor hockey player Evan Frustaglio, 13, from the H1N1 virus has the flu on sports parents' radar.</p>
<p>"We've already had a parent who arrived at a practice and the child wasn't feeling well. I said 'Go home, don't worry about it, rest,'" said Wes Hahn, the head coach of a Blessed Sacrament girls' Rep basketball team.</p>
<p>"We've had a child miss a game already. So, no question it is on the radar, we're watching it carefully.</p>
<p>"Sports are important but my thinking is 'keep your kid healthy.' If they are not healthy, keep them home. If we have to miss a tournament because everyone is ill, that is the way it is. You want kids healthy. You don't want to put them in a situation where they are playing sick. I would never do that."</p>
<p>The club basketball tournament schedule isn't in full swing yet. But the club rep level could be susceptible to an outbreak. The players are in close contact with many hands touching the same ball. And the competition is taking place in front of spectators confined to small bleachers in school gymnasiums.</p>
<p>Already, diligent parents are spraying hand sanitizer on players hands as a post-practice ritual.</p>
<p>"I have heard of certain situations where teams have chosen not to shake hands at the game but recognize they were good sports by still walking through the line but maybe with a nod to the head rather than a handshake," said Hahn, adding he'll take his lead from public health officials.</p>
<p>Michelle Gomes, recreational administrator for the Burlington Youth Soccer Club, spent yesterday in a vain bid to find hand sanitizer to stock the club's two soccer bubbles.</p>
<p>Gomes said the club is also considering putting a temporary ban on post-game handshakes as part of their fall indoor schedule.</p>
<p>"We are talking about it, we just haven't come up with what we should recommend," she said. "We're dealing with kids who are four and we're dealing with adults. For a four-year-old, it means a whole lot more when you give a cheer at the end of the game than a 21-year-old."</p>
<p>Gomes said so far the flu hasn't affected the club. Butorganizers remain wary.</p>
<p>Peter Martin, past president of the Hamilton Hockey Council, said it is reminding families to take simple precautions with their players.</p>
<p>"People have said they are going to be more diligent than they have been in the past. They would probably keep them home earlier, keep them home longer, keep a closer eye on them."</p>
<p>So far most teams seem to have been spared widespread absences and no tournaments have been cancelled because of the flu.</p>
<p>Joanne Condello, acting athletic convener for the Hamilton- Wentworth Catholic District School Board, said to date just one football contest has had to be cancelled because a team had too many flu-riddled players to compete.</p>
<p>Condello said there are no plans to cancel intra-school athletics as a precautionary measure.</p>

<p>Megan Laurienzo's English and art assignment is a Grade 8 project, but it's also social commentary.</p>
<p>When the R.A. Riddell Public School student was asked to prepare an oral presentation on a phobia, the 13-year-old chose the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's my phobia ... I'm terrified of it," Laurienzo said yesterday. "I think people might have it and might be coming to school."</p>
<p>She said only 12 of 26 students showed up for class yesterday.</p>
<p>"I think the parents panicked," Laurienzo said, adding one classmate came to school wearing a mask and gloves.</p>
<p>Parents were notified by phone Tuesday of an outbreak at the elementary school near Garth Street and Stone Church Road West.</p>
<p>The number of Hamilton public schools facing an outbreak jumped to 56 yesterday from 38, school board spokesperson Jackie Penman said.</p>
<p>"We're doing everything we can. We're working very closely with public health."</p>
<p>There are five more elementary schools being monitored for potential outbreak, said John Forbeck, superintendent of staff and community engagement. He added some of them have been hovering around the threshold for an official outbreak for two weeks.</p>
<p>"This is unpredictable," he said.</p>
<p>Ten Catholic schools have been hit by an outbreak, education superintendent Jackie Bajus said.</p>
<p>While both school boards are implementing more vigorous cleaning procedures, mounting fear is already reflected in classroom attendance.</p>
<p>At R.A. Riddell -- where about 700 students are enrolled -- more than 100 students are staying home, parents say.</p>
<p>Norm Proulx said almost 30 per cent of the 185 students at St. Catherine of Siena Separate School are staying home. This includes his daughter, Danielle, who's in Grade 2.</p>
<p>Jonah Moor, a Grade 7 R.A. Riddell student, said his math test was cancelled yesterday after six of his 24 classmates stayed home.</p>
<p>While Forbeck maintained scheduled programs and activities would not be cancelled, there were individual examples of axed events around the city. A movie night at Chedoke elementary school and a coffee house event at Ancaster high school are among the casualties in the H1N1 scare.</p>
<p>Parents at five Hamilton schools experienced scare yesterday when the public school board mistakenly sent out automated calls notifying them of an outbreak.</p>
<p>Eastmount Park, Fessenden, King George, Queen's Rangers and Memorial Stoney Creek are not outbreak schools and parents can ignore these calls for now, Penman said.</p>
<p>"We apologize for any distress this may have caused," she said.</p>

</p>
<p>What to do if your child gets sick:</p>
<p>Don't panic. The vast majority only get a mild flu. With proper care, most start to feel better in a few days and recover in one to two weeks.</p>
<p>Symptoms:</p>
<p>Sudden onset of high fever, headache, aches and pains, fatigue and weakness, runny, stuffy nose, sore throat, vomiting, coughing and sometimes sneezing.</p>
<p>Symptoms in babies and children under five:</p>
<p>Fever may be the only symptom, while others have mild or no fever. Some babies can't drink or breastfeed. Other symptoms are nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach pain, croup (coughing), pneumonia or bronchitis, ear infections and red, sore eyes. Toddlers and babies may be irritable, eat poorly, have a hoarse cry and a barking cough.</p>
<p>Treating a mild infection:</p>
<p>Take a child's temperature first. If there's a fever, give him or her frequent small drinks of fluids and regular doses of acetaminophen (such as Tylenol, Tempra) to keep temperature below 38.5 C. Do not give ASA (acetylsalicylic acid or Aspirin) to a child under 18 -- it can cause Reye's syndrome, a serious condition affecting the nervous system and liver.</p>
<p>Apply a hot water bottle or heating pad for short periods of time to reduce muscle pain. Give a warm bath. Have your child gargle with warm water and, if he or she is old enough, suck on hard candy, lozenges or ice chips. Try saline drops or spray to clear a stuffy nose. Make the home smoke-free. Do not use cold baths or alcohol rubs. Encourage the child to rest or involve him or her in quiet activities. Elevate the head of the bed. Babies may be more comfortable in a car seat. Use a clean humidifier.</p>
<p>See a doctor if your child:</p>
<p>Feels worse; is under six months; has a fever that rises or stays the same after medication; has difficulty breathing; is very listless or irritable; urinates less than usual (for instance, a dry diaper for more than three hours).</p>
<p>Go to the emergency room if your child:</p>
<p>Has severe trouble breathing and it is not caused by a stuffy nose; has bluish lips or hands; suddenly becomes pale; has cold legs up to their knees; is drowsy to the point he or she cannot be easily wakened; has severe crankiness or does not want to be held; is dehydrated -- not enough fluids and not going to the bathroom regularly; is very tired or unable to move; shows signs of pain, such as headache or stiff neck, especially if he or she also has a fever, is listless and has eyes sensitive to light; seems confused or has a seizure; gets better but then suddenly gets worse.</p>

<p>Just talking about his frustration with the flu shot lineups leaves him out of breath.</p>
<p>His voice is weak. His breathing laboured.</p>
<p>"I'm scared that if I get H1N1, it will kill me," Brian Mego gasps.</p>
<p>Brian is 42 and has alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a genetic respiratory disorder that causes emphysema and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He has about 15 per cent lung capacity. As if that wasn't enough, he's undergoing testing for lung cancer. What he needs is a lung transplant, but doctors are trying to determine if he would survive.</p>
<p>All of that puts Brian right up there on the list of high-risk patients being told by public health officials to have the H1N1 vaccination now at one of the priority clinics.</p>
<p>Brian wants a shot. He wants to protect himself.</p>
<p>So his wife -- who works in a high-risk H1N1 environment -- called the public health department's H1N1 hotline to ask what her severely compromised husband could expect upon attending one of the clinics open this week. Would there be disabled parking? Would he go to the front of the line?</p>
<p>No special parking and first come, first served, she was told.</p>
<p>So Brian gathered his strength Tuesday and drove to the clinic nearest to his home, the one at St. Helen Catholic School on Britannia Avenue. He got there 15 minutes before the clinic opened.</p>
<p>He found a parking spot. Three blocks away. And he saw the line-up. He estimates it was 500 people long.</p>
<p>"I didn't even try," he says. "I know my limitations. There was no way."</p>
<p>Some days it is a struggle for Brian, a former truck driver, to get from one side of his house to the other.</p>
<p>Even under the best conditions, Brian is not to be around large crowds or spend time outdoors in bad weather, for fear of catching something.</p>
<p>How ironic.</p>
<p>To get their shots, people are standing with a crowd of strangers, for hours in a lineup that is, in most locations, partly outdoors.</p>
<p>"And why are they having a clinic at a school, when I've heard that so many of the schools are contaminated?" he wonders.</p>
<p>The public health unit has some reassuring news for Brian and others in the same situation. Yet there is no perfect solution.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Brian would definitely be "fast-tracked" to the front of the line if he came to a clinic and "self-reported" that he is too ill to wait, says Tara Hall, communications officer for Hamilton Public Health.</p>
<p>No documentation would be needed if it is "quite clear, obvious, they need this kind of attention," she says.</p>
<p>However, there is no guarantee Brian will get a parking spot close to the front door of the clinic.</p>
<p>Hall says it depends on where the clinic is whether or not there is disabled parking. She suggests if there are police officers doing traffic control -- as is the case at the Dundas clinic -- they should be able to help Brian get a parking spot.</p>
<p>Could he call ahead to the hotline and arrange for help with parking and making his way to the front of the line?</p>
<p>"We just can't accommodate that kind of request," says Hall.</p>
<p>As for concerns about entering a possibly infected school, she says H1N1 is everywhere -- in arenas, in grocery stores -- anywhere the public gathers. All Brian or others can do is take the precautions that are recommended, such as frequent hand washing and use of sanitizing gel.</p>
<p>She adds that anyone who feels they cannot even get themselves to a clinic in order to be fast-tracked, should contact their family doctor to arrange for a shot there.</p>
<p>However, not all family doctors have the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I guess I'll give it another try," says Brian, 24 hours after he abandoned his first attempt to get a shot. But first he needs to contact his doctor at the Firestone Institute for Respiratory Health because he has developed a fever.</p>

</div><div>By Joseph Hall   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>If your children awoke today with the flu and its classic symptoms - fever, cough, aches - they have H1N1.</p>
<p>The question now is: what should you do about it?</p>
<p>Dr. Donald Low, one of Canada's leading communicable disease experts and head of microbiology at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, says, there are some things you almost always shouldn't do.</p>
<p>Don't take your child to the doctor unless he or she is in a group designated high risk.</p>
<p>Don't give antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>And don't panic.</p>
<p>Only if symptoms visibly worsen should low-risk kids be brought to the doctor and given antiviral drugs, Low says, particularly if the child develops shortness of breath.</p>
<p>"This is the single most important indicator that things may not be going well and may require antiviral therapy, plus or minus antibiotics."</p>
<p>Despite the H1N1 death of 13-year-old Toronto hockey player Evan Frustaglio this week, the disease just isn't that dangerous for the vast majority of healthy children, Low says. They should simply be kept at home.</p>
<p>"And 99.9 per cent of these kids are going to feel miserable for a few days, they're going to have a temperature, they're going to have some muscle aches, they're going to be lying around at home," Low says. "And then they're going to get better."</p>
<p>Those considered at high risk are children under five, especially those two and under.</p>
<p>Children with asthma, neurological ailments such as muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, or chronic conditions such as kidney or heart disease are also at high risk.</p>
<p>For these children, doctors need not even test for the disease, he says.</p>
<p>Given that the ailment has taken hold so thoroughly, doctors should just assume it's H1N1.</p>
<p>"High-risk groups that are clearly identified should seek medical attention so that they can start antiviral drugs like Tamiflu," says Low, who is also the laboratory director at Ontario's Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>For the tiny fraction of children who, like Evan, may succumb to the disease, there's often little that could save them to begin with, he says.</p>
<p>Whether due to a genetic predisposition or a lurking bacterial infection, these children will experience sudden, overwhelming illness.</p>
<p>Any flu virus, seasonal or pandemic, may prompt such a response, and even with prompt use of antivirals, there may be little doctors can do to reverse the lethal cascade.</p>
<p>Known as a "cytokine storm," the process causes pneumonia-like conditions. It was responsible for millions of deaths among healthy young adults during the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic.</p>
<p>And while it's now clear that H1N1 is incapable of producing similar immune system storms in the vast majority of healthy people, a small number will undoubtedly fall victim this year.</p>

<p>NHL</p>
<p>League confirms third player diagnosed with H1N1</p>
<p>TORONTO - The National Hockey League is watching the progression of H1N1 cases among its players but at this point sees no need for special measures to help prevent spread of the illness. The Washington Capitals confirmed Wednesday that forward Quintin Laing is being treated for H1N1, making him at least the third NHL player to be diagnosed with it. On Tuesday cases were confirmed for Edmonton Oilers defenceman Ladislav Smid and Colorado Avalanche goalie Peter Budaj. New York Islanders forward Doug Weight returned to the lineup Wednesday after missing three games with H1N1. The Capitals said no other players have shown symptoms of the H1N1 and that Laing is being kept away from the team.</p>
<p>NFL</p>
<p>Bills QB Edwards back at practice following concussion</p>
<p>BUFFALO, N.Y. - Trent Edwards' first priority is getting healthy before he'll worry about reclaiming his job as the Bills' starting quarterback. Edwards practised on a limited basis Wednesday for the first time since sustaining a concussion in a 16-13 overtime win at the New York Jets on Oct. 18. He's already been ruled out from playing against Houston this weekend. Edwards said he's feeling better and noted that any concussion-related effects are "slowly but surely" going away. He steered away from a question about whether he'll have to unseat backup Ryan Fitzpatrick, who's led Buffalo (3-4) to two straight wins. "That's not on the top of my mind right now," he said, noting he'll assist Fitzpatrick.</p>
<p>CFL</p>
<p>Argos coach, linebacker fined for ripping officiating</p>
<p>TORONTO - The Canadian Football League fined Toronto Argonauts coach Bart Andrus $1,000 and linebacker Zeke Moreno an undisclosed sum for "publicly disparaging" league officiating. Andrus and Moreno both questioned the quality of game officials in the wake of Friday's 26-17 loss to Hamilton, during which an offside call nullified a 47-yard interception return for a touchdown by Moreno. Andrus said: "I'm just saying the stuff is not consistent, game to game, crew to crew." Moreno added: "I don't really like to complain about officiating, but there were so many calls in this game that kind of make me wonder how much effort and time these officials put into scouting and watching film."</p>
<p>NHL</p>
<p>Luongo sidelined with fractured ribs</p>
<p>VANCOUVER - The Vancouver Canucks have lost all-star goaltender Roberto Luongo for at least the next two games because of a hairline rib fracture but just how long he'll miss depends on his stubborn streak. Luongo played three games with the injury and said Wednesday his return depends on his pain tolerance and ensuring it doesn't hamper his play for the rest of the NHL season. "I am stubborn so I don't know," Luongo said when asked about the possibility of an early return. The injury comes at a time when the injury-depleted Canucks (6-6-0) play nine games in 17 nights, starting Thursday in Los Angeles against the Kings (8-4-0), who lead the division.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>A lawyer before being elected as Guelph's MP, Frank Valeriote rarely gets through a day without shaking a number of hands.</p>
<p>However, with the concern over the H1N1 flu and several Canadians forgoing handshakes, Valeriote recently stopped to think twice about extending his hand.</p>
<p>"It's a habit that's hard to resist," Valeriote said. "It's courtesy to extend your hand."</p>
<p>He said he's in the habit of using a hand sanitizer, a similar comment made by others who shake quite a few hands due to their profession, such as Guelph MPP Liz Sandals and Mayor Karen Farbridge.</p>
<p>If he doesn't shake someone's hand, Valeriote said he'll let the person know the reason.</p>
<p>"I don't want anybody to misunderstand why I'm not shaking their hand," Valeriote said.</p>
<p>Sandals said she plans on getting the H1N1 vaccine and gets a flu shot every year. However, she doesn't think she'll stop shaking hands.</p>
<p>"It's probably ingrained in me," she said. "I just do what comes naturally."</p>
<p>Farbridge admitted a similar difficulty when it came to avoiding handshakes.</p>
<p>"It's such an automatic response to extend your hand that I've found challenging," she said.</p>
<p>In some occasions, Farbridge said she's found people have bumped elbows with her, instead of shaking hands.</p>
<p>Lakeside Bible Church pastor Dave Ralph said even before the fears of H1N1, he was conscious of transferring germs through handshakes at his services.</p>
<p>"Often on a Monday, I would wake up with a sore throat," he said. Ralph said he always makes sure to sanitize his hands and if he's sick, he won't shake anyone's hands. He doesn't though envision completely forgoing handshakes altogether.</p>

</p>
<p>Health experts and sports associations are urging athletes to avoid sharing water bottles or personal items such as towels to avoid the spread of the H1N1 flu, which killed an 13-year-old avid hockey player earlier this week.</p>
<p>Passing around water bottles, for example, a well-worn habit among many younger players, is a particular no-no given how the virus is spread, experts said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"The risk of H1N1 transmission with shared water bottles would be huge," said Dr. Brian Ward, an infectious disease expert at McGill University. "Personal water bottles, please."</p>
<p>On Monday, avid hockey player Evan Frustaglio, 13, of Toronto died from the H1N1 flu, although it's not clear how he contracted it.</p>
<p>Frustaglio began feeling ill over the weekend as he competed at a hockey tournament in London. At least two other players on his team have also exhibited flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The Waterloo Wolves Bantam AA team - which also played at the London tournament - posted a message of condolence on its website.</p>
<p>The Wolves didn't play in the same level as Frustaglio's Mississauga North Stars, a Minor Bantam AA team whose players are generally younger. Still, the tragedy resonated with those who'd been in London.</p>
<p>"It certainly brought it home to me a little more," said Mary Kraehling, whose son Matt tends goal for the Wolves.</p>
<p>Coach Don Bush said the team would be implementing changes, such as personal water bottles. "You don't really think of it coming this close," Bush said. "It really hammered the message home.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Flu-like symptoms are sweeping through the Guelph area community, sending kids home from school and the public flocking to emergency rooms or scrambling for good advice on health-care hotlines.</p>
<p>Monday's pandemic H1N1 flu death of athletic Toronto youth Evan Frustaglio in particular has jarred a public already fearful the nation is in the grip of both this and seasonal flu.</p>
<p>"I think the death of the 13-year-old shocked everyone," Guelph General Hospital spokesperson Perry Hagerman said yesterday, noting a third of all people now flocking to the emergency department have ILI, the term for influenza-like illnesses.</p>
<p>The emergency department averages more than 120 visits a day, but those have jumped 30 per cent in the past four days, up from a rise of 20 per cent two weeks ago, Hagerman said.</p>
<p>Further, hospital employees are also calling in sick in high numbers: 100 calls in the last three weeks among a staff complement of 1,150.</p>
<p>Hagerman added that an unusually high number of hospital visitors appear ill in recent days. Those with coughs are immediately directed to surgical masks and hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Hospital staff met Wednesday afternoon to update their ILI planning amid rapidly changing circumstance and if matters get worse in coming days, restrictions on hospital visits may result.</p>
<p>"It is something we're considering," he said.</p>
<p>School absenteeism has mushroomed, medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer of Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health said Wednesday.</p>
<p>She added not all absenteeism is attributable to flu.</p>
<p>"We don't always know why somebody's off," she said. "But we have seen a large number of schools with absenteeism greater than 10 per cent. "</p>
<p>Family physicians are seeing increasing volumes of patients, Mercer said.</p>
<p>"That's a sign people are getting sick with influenza symptoms."</p>
<p>Her Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health unit fielded 650 calls Wednesday alone to its flu hotline, communications manager Jan Craig said. The health board's hotline is at: 1-800-265-7293, ext. 4161. It begins flu vaccinations Friday in Guelph and Nov. 2 in Fergus and Orangeville (with more information at www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org]).</p>
<p>The health board will add more clinics and extend their hours of operation if this becomes necessary, Mercer said.</p>
<p>About 20 per cent of Guelph's Crestwicke Christian Academy student body of 134 is off sick, principal Steve Ellis said.</p>
<p>"It's unusual numbers," he said, adding that's doubly strange because it's so early in the flu season.</p>
<p>"Our staff are fine; the odd teacher is out (sick)." Parents are dropping by to pick up homework for children who can't attend classes.</p>
<p>While he's concerned about the health of kids in school, Ellis is taking it a day at a time, stressing good hygiene. That means using hand sanitizers and drinking from individual paper cups rather than sharing water fountains.</p>
<p>"Kids have the flu, coughs and colds, but it's school as usual," he said.</p>
<p>The provincial Ministry of Education this week began asking school boards to report any absenteeism above 10 per cent of a school's population.</p>
<p>"We're in the process of working out how to do that," Upper Grand District School Board spokesperson Maggie McFadzen said. "I can tell you some schools have likely hit the 10 per cent-plus (mark)," she said.</p>
<p>"We want people to keep their kids home if their kids are sick." But they shouldn't keep their healthy kids away from school if they've only heard rumours that other children seem ill, she stressed.</p>
<p>It would be irresponsible for educators to circulate rumours among school communities about which kids are ill with the flu, McFadzen said.</p>
<p>"We have parents upset because they believe we're shirking our duty," she said, frustrated that some parents want to know about suspected cases.</p>
<p>She acknowledged flu must be respected as a potential health threat.</p>
<p>"The community needs to know it's out there. That's what pandemic means."</p>
<p>Evan's death makes that clear.</p>
<p>"That is upsetting, believe me, to every parent, everybody who works in education."</p>
<p>Her bottom-line advice is: "Send well children to school and keep ill children at home."</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>University of Guelph students have been stricken with the H1N1 virus. Just how many is unknown.</p>
<p>Alastair Summerlee, the school's president, confirmed Wednesday that some students enrolled at the university have fallen ill with the virus.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus was the first topic of discussion at the school year's first Rumour Mill, a question-and-answer open house hosted by Summerlee to inform students, staff and faculty.</p>
<p>"Most have been advised to go home and take care," Summerlee said.</p>
<p>He said more students may have flu-like symptoms but that "we may never know whether it's the flu or H1N1."</p>
<p>That's because students feeling ill report to the school's Student Health Services where they are diagnosed based on symptoms rather than blood tests.</p>
<p>Students who are known to have been infected were those who were tested at the hospital.</p>
<p>Communications manager Lori Bona Hunt said some faculty has fallen ill with H1N1, too.</p>
<p>"But without being tested, you just don't know," she said. "And even then, it takes up to 10 days to find out for sure."</p>
<p>The University of Guelph will begin offering vaccination clinics on Monday on the second floor of the Powell Building. The clinic is open to staff, students and faculty.</p>
<p>Clinics will run Monday and Tuesday and every other Friday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. through Dec. 1.</p>
<p>Both the H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines will be available.</p>
<p>"We recommend that as it becomes available students get vaccinated," Summerlee said. "Obviously, it's something to make a personal choice about."</p>
<p>Summerlee also addressed the school's several monetary situations, including external fundraising and endowment funds.</p>
<p>Summerlee said his goal is to raise $20 million a year, but the school fell short last year, raising $15 million.</p>
<p>However, Summerlee said "we're ahead of our target for this year" and that the school will finish "somewhere north of $20 million."</p>
<p>That's a relief for the cash-strapped school with a $16 million structural deficit.</p>

</p>
<p>I find myself profoundly sad that reports are forecasting that, due to what some have called a "perfect storm" of economic restraints, H1N1 fears and fewer Canadian children of trick-or-treating age, we may find ourselves indulging in Halloween treats deep into the new year.</p>
<p>At the best of times, my wife and I have been perplexed in correctly gauging the amount of candy to buy for this semi-satanic-non-holiday that we participate in. And only once, in our 20 years of being in a position to hand out treats have we ever actually run out of stock.</p>
<p>Regardless, we're still planning to stock up on our favorite mini-chocolate bars. I guess the trick that we've learned is to purchase only our favourites so that no treat goes to waste.</p>
<p>This past Sunday, I was reminded of our first Halloween together. The warm October wind blew hard to wake the wind chimes hanging under the veranda of our back porch. We used to have them hanging on our balcony when we lived in an apartment on St. John's Blvd. in Pointe Claire.</p>
<p>My mother bought them for us around year six of our eventual nine-year term of subsisting in the little 31/2 apartment before eventually finding our home in Baie d'Urfé.</p>
<p>I guess she had hoped the chimes, which clanged incessantly on St. John's, would create a homier ambiance. The chimes were so loud, though, that they actually became a kind of incentive to continue looking for an escape.</p>
<p>As it was, we were unable to appreciate the charming chiming for it became part of the ambient noise of the place: honk, holler, scream, squeal, rev-rev and ding-a-ling-a-chime.</p>
<p>But back to our first Halloween.</p>
<p>Kathy and I had no idea what to expect as we prepared for the big night. We both figured that an apartment building would be overrun with trick-or-treaters. A warm, enclosed environment with dwellings in such close proximity; 10 minutes up and down a few flights of stairs and a pillow case would be full.</p>
<p>So we bought all the best candy we could not really afford, and even bought a CD of ghostly Halloween sounds to resound in the background. We didn't have the chimes, yet.</p>
<p>We took out a little bowl and filled it from our penny-only change jar for UNICEF. It was penny only at this point because we had been robbed after living only two weeks in the apartment. It was peculiar, as our door was still locked when we got home. Lesson learned: new apartment, new locks, please. And get the receipt.</p>
<p>Working some Halloween imagery, wires dangled like tendons from torn off limbs where once all of our CDs, CD player, video machine had once been. We had been violated and were sick.</p>
<p>What made us feel most violated, ironically, was the change jar. Always using bills when shopping, all change went into the jar. This is helpful for weekly pizza nights or other treats. A friend of mine used his for a vacation, as loonies and toonies can add up quick.</p>
<p>The week prior to our move, I had rolled all the silver (loonies and toonies didn't exist yet) into, apparently, very convenient to pilfer rolls and left it (inexplicably) in my underwear drawer. Having them stolen from there made it all the more disturbing.</p>
<p>With our UNICEF jar stocked only with pennies, we anxiously sat by the door; lights dimmed, CD playing ridiculous howling, thunderclap noises, bowl of candy in each of our laps.</p>
<p>After an hour, it became painfully obvious that it was all for naught. Not a soul came by that night. Still today, I feel the pangs we both felt then; tossed candy wrappers strewn all over, chocolate smudges around our mouths.</p>
<p>Whatever the forecast is for this year, I think it's best, ironically, not to be sad, or afraid. Halloween is not about that.</p>

<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>Toronto's Bridgepoint Hospital is coping with an H1N1 outbreak after 11 patients and five health-care workers in the hospital's Neuromuscular Support Unit contracted the virulent flu strain, the hospital said in a release issued Thursday.</p>
<p>Two of the 16 people experiencing the symptoms have been referred to acute-care hospitals for further care, and other patients and health-care workers in the ward are being treated with antivirals and the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>“Bridgepoint Health is working with Toronto Public Health and our Infectious Disease Specialists to manage the outbreak and contain its spread,” Bridgepoint President and CEO Marian Walsh said in the statement. “From the onset of the outbreak, we responded as though the virus was H1N1, which lab results now confirm. We were not going to take any chances.”</p>
<p>The release emphasized the flu outbreaks are common in hospitals at this time of year, but cautioned visitors and staff not to come to hospital if they're experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Barbara Yaffe, Toronto's associate medical officer of health, confirmed an outbreak of H1N1 at Mount Sinai hospital. There were three cases of influenza among patients and staff in the intensive-care unit.</p>

<p>In the Cambrian Mall on Great Northern Road in Sault Ste. Marie, Ont., the Algoma District Public Health clinic is doing a brisk business – a smooth flow of patients coming and going for flu shots.</p>
<p>No frustrating lineups. No one turned away because the vaccine supply has run out or the staff is overrun.</p>
<p>Why is the Soo's system working so well? Because all of the vaccinations were given by appointment.</p>
<p>In the past week, some 23 staffers at a local call centre have been working 12 hours a day booking appointments – 3,500 a day, according to a spokeswoman – for residents of the district at vaccination clinics at the Mall and in Elliot Lake, Wawa, Blind River and other area towns.</p>
<p>Patients simply call the hotline, make their appointment, show up at the designated place and time and roll up their sleeves, and off they go.</p>
<p>As demand for H1N1 flu vaccine rises exponentially across Canada, health officials in other areas are struggling to find a model for fast and efficient delivery.</p>
<p>That Sault Ste. Marie (population 80,000) should be showing the rest of the country leadership on dealing with the new pandemic is perhaps no surprise.</p>
<p>For two decades, it has been in the vanguard of public health-care delivery, marshalling limited resources to maximum effect. Not for nothing did Roy Romanow, former head of the royal commission on the future of health care, call its approach “the best-kept secret in the country.” Not for nothing did Michael Decter, chairman of the Health Council of Canada, tell local officials that the Sault Ste. Marie community had built an enviable track record in procedures and co-operation that other Ontario towns and cities were only beginning to consider.</p>
<p>Today, while other communities are still scrambling to organize a coherent strategy for H1N1 immunization, a private-public partnership in the Soo is using the Group Health Centre's telephone lines to book the appointments electronically and reducing waits to a minimum.</p>
<p>“Our philosophy is to get people in and out as quickly as possible,” said Elizabeth Bodnar, spokeswoman for the health centre. “This approach allows us to know every day exactly how much vaccine and staff we will need.”</p>
<p>Her 60-physician facility, the city's largest medical clinic, switched to electronic record keeping for patients almost two decades ago. It has been working in tandem with officials at Algoma Public Health for 12 years to expedite delivery of seasonal flu shots.</p>
<p>“This partnership has worked very well for us,” said Allan Northan, chief medical officer of health for the Algoma district.</p>
<p>The effects are seamless. As patients are immunized, vaccine dosages and other relevant medical information are automatically entered into an electronic record.</p>
<p>The sole frustration, Dr. Northan said, is that demand for appointments is running so high that it's occasionally difficult to reach a call-centre operator.</p>
<p>The flood of initial calls was so great that the Group Health Centre worked with <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span> to isolate the flu-booking lines from its other lines, letting patients get through more easily.</p>
<p>Dr. Northan said that in addition to its own clinics, the public health agency is planning to hold evening vaccination clinics at schools.</p>
<p>The Algoma agency started discussing the electronic appointment method for H1N1 vaccination two months ago.</p>
<p>Dr. Northan said Algoma is the only health district in the province that he knows of that is using a computerized system for appointments. “It's probably too late for other jurisdictions to set this up,” he said. “They're busy as heck. But there's no reason why, eventually, the entire province could not do it.”</p>
<p>Although many communities might not have the infrastructure to support call centres, Ms. Bodnar suggested that the Public Health Agency of Canada could contract with commercial call centres and offer 1-800 numbers to facilitate appointment bookings for community clinics.</p>

</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK AND LINDA NGUYEN   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>605 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Canadians were told yesterday by public health officials to avoid travel, including public transit, if they show any signs of the H1N1 virus, a warning that came the same day a report described airports across the country as "major gateways for infectious diseases."</p>
<p>The federal government released the new set of travel guidelines as part of a nationwide effort to curtail the spread of the novel influenza strain during its second wave. The swine flu reached outbreak proportions worldwide last spring.</p>
<p>The document urges that passengers and crew who appear ill with H1N1 flu separate themselves from others as much as possible and that crew minimize their contact with any sick passengers.</p>
<p>Those sick should wear a surgical face mask to help protect others.</p>
<p>People who are sick and cannot avoid travel are being asked to go by car if possible, and travel operators are being asked to make it easy for Canadians to rebook their plans.</p>
<p>Those travelling internationally will be reported, as required by law, if they are suspected of being able to spread a communicable disease, including H1N1. Quarantine officers would assess the situation and advise whether action is required for the sick passenger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal yesterday singled out Toronto's Pearson airport as the "most vulnerable point of entry in Canada," followed by Vancouver's airport and Montreal's Trudeau.</p>
<p>The report called for thermal sensors, increased passenger screening and other testing methods to be employed by airports to reduce the spread of infection. It warned that limiting travel was the central focus of efforts to prevent the spread of SARS when that disease first surfaced in 2002.</p>
<p>"The overwhelming number of SARS cases that moved from country to country were by air travel," said Dr. Kamran Khan of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto in the report. "Now we're seeing the same with novel H1N1."</p>
<p>Across the country, emergency rooms and telephone health lines continued to jam yesterday as concerned parents anxious about their children sought medical assistance.</p>
<p>In Toronto, officials confirmed late yesterday an outbreak of H1N1 flu at Mount Sinai Hospital that was limited to one ward and involved two staff members and a patient. It is the first outbreak reported at a Canadian hospital.</p>
<p>A potential outbreak at a long-term care facility in Toronto was also being investigated.</p>
<p>At the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Dr. Anne Matlow said yesterday the emergency room has seen "double" the number of patients in the last few days compared to what was considered normal for the start of the influenza season.</p>
<p>At Ottawa's Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, staff were reporting that their emergency clinic, which usually sees 150 children on any given day in October, has risen to more than double that number. Two-thirds of the children who have come in have been identified as having flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>There were 608 people lined up at a clinic in Gatineau yesterday before it opened at 8:30 a.m., and anyone who arrived later was told to come back another day because the clinic could only take 600 people a day.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq warned yesterday that the hours-long lineups will continue as crowds gather to get their vaccinations.</p>
<p>"This needs to continue for three simple reasons: The H1N1 flu virus season is here, more people are getting sick and the vaccine has been proven safe and effective," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>From play areas to métro trains, sharing germs is a concern; 'Slides and climbers sterilized every day'</b>
</div><div>ANNE SUTHERLAND   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>493 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>As the paranoia about germs and the spread of the H1N1 flu virus mounts, IKEA is keeping its play areas very clean.</p>
<p>The store's supervised ball room, where kids romp and cavort among multicoloured balls, is being sterilized and cleaned daily as part of the retailer's precautionary measures.</p>
<p>"The slides and climbers are also cleaned and sterilized every day, and we're not allowing kids who are sick in the play area," said company spokesperson Madeline Frick. "We do have a pandemic preparedness plan."</p>
<p>Frick said IKEA has no plans to close the play areas in its stores, and did not do so at the height of the SARS scare in Toronto in 2003.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">McDonald's</span> canned the balls in the play areas of its restaurants years ago.</p>
<p>"We haven't had any ball pits in our restaurants in many years," said Louis Payette, national media relations manager of <span class="companylink">McDonald's Restaurants of Canada Ltd</span>.</p>
<p>"We diligently adhere to the highest standards of hygiene and sanitation in our restaurants, including hand-washing procedures and cleaning of our PlayPlaces that meet or exceed the World Health Organization and the Public Health Agency of Canada's recommendations for helping to prevent the spread of flu," Payette wrote in an email.</p>
<p>With so many of us using public transit, the danger of sharing germs by hanging on the straps or poles on the buses and métro trains is also a concern.</p>
<p>Marianne Rouette, spokesperson for the <span class="companylink">Société de Transport de Montréal</span>, said that the transit agency has not altered its cleaning procedures except to provide hand sanitizer for workers who deal with the public, such as the staff in ticket booths.</p>
<p>"Our cleaning is the same as always, and ultimately the best prevention for the public is to be aware of their own protection, to wash their hands often and to sneeze into an elbow or handkerchief," Rouette said.</p>
<p>The advent of colder weather should also help because more of us are wearing gloves, she said.</p>
<p>"I'm a citizen, too, not just a worker for the STM, so I'm wearing my gloves, sneezing in my elbow, carrying sanitizer and washing my hands a lot," Rouette said.</p>
<p>The transit agency is taking cues from the city health department on the question of changing its routines.</p>
<p>"We are working closely with the Montreal Public Health Department, the boroughs and public security.</p>
<p>"This is a delicate matter and we want to reassure the public. Any decisions about special changes will be made by the public health department," Rouette said.</p>

<p>RED WINGS AT OILERS - 7:30 p.m. - TsN - 630 CHED</p>
<p>RECORDS: Oilers 6-5-1 Red Wings 4-4-2</p>
<p>SEASON SERIES:</p>
<p>Dec. 3: at Detroit March 19: at Rexall Place March 30: at Detroit</p>
<p>Storyline</p>
<p>The Oilers may lead the NHL in guys hacking and coughing, with one confirmed case of swine flu, while the Red Wings are pretty healthy, except on the ice where they are a very ordinary .500 hockey club. If the playoffs started today, they would be on the outside looking in.</p>
<p>The Oilers, who had all their regulars practising on Wednesday, except Lubomir Visnovsky who is in sick bay, haven't scored a goal in over seven periods. The last goal was Dustin Penner's power-play marker in Calgary late in the second period on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Red Wings are giving up way too many goals (3.5 per game average). Only five clubs--Toronto, Florida, Anaheim, Columbus and the Islanders--are worse. Their penalty-killing is mediocre, especially on the road, where they are dead last. They've given up seven goals in 19 tries. Detroit has only won one of five on the road this season.</p>
<p>The other side</p>
<p>Red Wings top line: They're loading up with Henrik Zetterberg on the wing with Pavel Datsyuk and Tomas Holmstrom rather than split up the centres Datsyuk and Zetterberg.</p>
<p>Top scorers: Zetterberg 1-9, 10 points; Holmstrom 6-2,8 points; Datsyuk 2-5, 7 points, Jason Williams 2-5, 7 points.</p>
<p>Waiting his turn</p>
<p>Fernando Pisani, still on long-term injury (back), skated hard on Wednesday. He might need more time because he's not in game shape, but he's close.</p>
<p>"I've really only had one real practice. I don't know if I can play. Last thing I want to do is jump into a game if I don't think my cardio or timing is there," said Pisani, who has had no issues with his back since skating.</p>
<p>"When he gets cleared, he'll have to come off the injured reserve and we'll have to make a roster move," said coach Pat Quinn. That could mean putting somebody else on LTI such as Sheldon Souray (concussion) so he won't count against the cap, or maybe putting somebody on waivers.</p>
<p>Due diligence</p>
<p>The Red Wings haven't been hit with the same flu as the Oilers, but they are taking precautions. For the first time player water bottles had their number on them at practice, and they used their own towels. No sharing. The training staff wiped down door knobs with disinfectant. Kris Draper told reporters he had starting washing his hands every time he touches the TV remote in his hotel room.</p>
<p>Who's Hot, Who's Not</p>
<p>Oilers: Dustin Penner has 12 points in his last eight games, while Ales Hemsky has nine. The flip-side: Shawn Horcoff has nothing in his last seven, Andrew Cogliano zero points in his last six, Patrick O'Sullivan one goal in his last eight.</p>
<p>Red Wings: Holmstrom has six goals in only 24 shots. The defence has scored seven goals, but Nicklas Lidstrom only has three points, pretty miserly by his standards. Lots of minuses. Todd Bertuzzi is minus-6, Valtteri Filppula, Dan Cleary and Jonathan Ericsson are all minus-5.</p>
<p>By the numbers</p>
<p>41 Shots for Zetterberg, ninth in the NHL.</p>
<p>+8 Penner is tied for seventh in plus/minus rating.</p>
<p>1 Game the Oilers outshot the opposition, and that was Game 1 against Calgary.</p>

</p>
<p>GAME TIME</p>
<p>RED WINGS AT OILERS 7:30 P.M.</p>
<p>630 CHed, TSN</p>
<p>Ladislav Smid, who contracted the H1N1 virus about two weeks ago, may have passed the swine flu along to his Edmonton Oilers teammates, but he didn't know he had it until Tuesday.</p>
<p>"I'm worried ... I don't want anybody getting sick because of me," said Smid, who is the fourth NHL player to get it.</p>
<p>New York Islanders centre Doug Weight, Washington Capitals forward Quintin Laing and Colorado Avalanche goalie Peter Budaj are the others.</p>
<p>Smid first came down with a high fever between the Minnesota Wild game on Oct. 16 and a home game against the Vancouver Canucks on Oct. 19.</p>
<p>"It's already happened. There's nothing I can do about it," said Smid, who played more than 20 minutes against Colorado on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Smid's locker-room neighbour Lubomir Visnovsky left Tuesday's game in the third period, completely worn out after playing 16 minutes.</p>
<p>"This is scary... I've read lots about it, about how people are dying. I feel bad for Lubo. He may have gotten it from me," said Smid.</p>
<p>"Lubo is being treated as if he has it, although he hasn't been tested," said Oilers coach Pat Quinn.</p>
<p>Centre Gilbert Brule, who missed three games last week with flu-like symptoms, was tested and results came back negative.</p>
<p>"It's weird. I was out a lot longer than Laddie," said Brule.</p>
<p>"You've got to be careful with using the right water bottles and hand sanitizers," Brule continued. "But this is airborne and it's always around you."</p>
<p>Smid's road roomie Denis Grebeshkov was also sick last weekend. He hasn't been tested and felt better on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I think I've battled through it," he said.</p>
<p>Ales Hemsky missed a game against Minnesota with the flu, and fellow forward Mike Comrie sat out last weekend's games at Calgary and Vancouver when he came down sick.</p>
<p>Dustin Penner has also been under the weather and needed a bathroom break in Calgary. Tom Gilbert was sick last weekend, but played. Robert Nilsson said Wednesday he was feeling short of breath.</p>
<p>"Maybe some guys have had it (H1N1) or there's a different flu going around, but last Friday in Calgary I woke up in a deep sweat after going to bed early. I had really deep congestion for two days (and two games), but mine is going away," said Gilbert.</p>
<p>"The doctor said this (flu) would attack you for two or three days and you would have a fever, and it'll be gone. Laddie was out two or three days...we thought it was regular flu, but I guess it wasn't," said Grebeshkov.</p>
<p>"People of our age, who are healthy, our bodies can battle through it. Me, personally, I wasn't scared," he added.</p>
<p>Smid says he's been sicker in the past and not had the swine flu.</p>
<p>"I was kind of shocked when they told me I had it. Brule had way worse symptoms than I did, and he didn't have it," Smid said.</p>
<p>"I guess I got lucky. It didn't hit me that bad. I had the fever for a day and a half, but was able to play. The virus is gone now."</p>
<p>At this time, the Oilers haven't had vaccinations to guard against the virus.</p>
<p>"We haven't been allocated the serum. The public has lined up, but we haven't asked our players to do so. We hope more supplies are coming in so it can be allocated to us in a systematic way," said Quinn.</p>
<p>"I'm sure the league is concerned about this. It's an issue we all knew was coming, and we'll deal with it," Quinn added.</p>
<p>The league has said it is monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>"We are regularly providing clubs with updated information and recommendations as they become available," said the league in a statement to the Canadian Press.</p>
<p>The league said there were no specific plans to contain the spread of the H1N1, but it is ready to act if need be. It hasn't changed its policy to allow teams more than a 23-man maximum roster because of the outbreak of either the swine flu or regular flu that is hitting many NHL clubs.</p>
<p>How much slack should the Oilers be getting, after losing three games in a row and not scoring in seven periods, knowing the flu has kicked them in the backside?</p>
<p>"We had our butts kicked by Colorado, too," said Quinn, who's not into using excuses.</p>
<p>"While some guys aren't so sick they had to be bedridden, we played three games in four days(Columbus, Calgary, Vancouver) and our tank looked like it was running pretty low against Colorado," said Quinn. "But you can't make excuses. There are legitimate reasons why teams, say, miss the playoffs because they've had severe injuries or lost their goaltender ... but to make excuses, you can't.</p>
<p>"You don't ever want players to be lining up with a pre-determined state of mind. We're sick but we're playing."</p>

<p>- Standing in line for three hours surrounded by coughing, wheezing people waiting for a flu shot seems to me a bigger risk than just staying home and not getting the vaccine. - After the third e-mail telling me I can avoid the H1N1 virus by putting dishes of raw onions in water around my house, I replied I could accomplish the same goal by hanging a dead rat around my neck. I have now been deleted from the dumb and dumber list. - I stand in a line 200-people deep for four hours. Finally I get to the front and find out it's for some flu shot. I thought I was waiting for tickets to the U2 show coming to town. - In light of the massive turnout for the H1N1 vaccination, maybe the government should have considered prioritizing the age groups which have been shown to be at higher risk, namely 20 to 60 years of age. I see a lot of seniors in line who have probably been exposed to this virus already at some point in their lifetimes.</p>
<p> - Perhaps it hasn't crossed anyone's mind that some seniors may be in line because they have compromised immune systems and are therefore still at risk. - If children are such a high-risk group, why aren't they immunizing in the schools? - With only six locations in Edmonton and a population of more than one million people, it will take until Christmas for this program to be completed. Isn't the goal to vaccinate the entire population as quickly as possible to stop the spread of the virus? - Maybe the government thought they'd get the same poor turnout for the H1N1 flu shot as they do at the polling stations during an election. - Gift cards and weekend getaways for ideas on how to save money in health care? They're joking, right? - Premier Stelmach's recent "bus driver" comments to Brian Mason in the legislature were out of line, unprofessional and inappropriate. - So, the premier doesn't value the opinion of a bus driver. What job do we need to have before we gain his respect? - I voted Conservative for 40 years. Now I'm convinced the Stelmach government is not capable of leading or managing Alberta. - What do you mean, there are no credible candidates for mayor? Surely we can find someone who won't throw millions toward the eyesore that is the art gallery and a zoo that isn't worth visiting. - As Const. Jim Smyth once wrote in his Journal traffic-safety column, if the driver ahead of you signals he is going to change lanes, he is telling you what he is going to do. He is not asking your permission. - Would it be possible for the folks at the Superstore to install coat hooks inside their men's washroom stalls?Maybe they could put on a lock that actually works, while they're at it. - When you're getting a general anesthetic, why do they always say, "Count backward from 10"? I've never gotten past eight. They should at least give us a chance and start at five. - We wrote two letters to Aeroplan to see if we could donate our air miles to the Make-a-Wish Foundation. We received no reply. Shame on them. - If your cat brings you a dead bird or mouse, it's a gift of affection. Contrary to what was in The Journal, the cat does not think you are a big kitten. - Just once, I'd like to see the price at the pumps go down 12 cents in a week.</p>

<p>I was at a Medicentre Monday and I waited three hours to see a doctor. The waiting room was full of people. Most people were coughing and sneezing and I am sure that germs were being spread.</p>
<p>There was only one doctor on duty from 5 to 10 p.m. At the clinic, you take a number and wait your turn, then you go up and give your health care card number to them and then wait to be called to see the doctor. People were walking out as the wait times were way too long.</p>
<p>While I was there, a woman came in who was having a hard time walking and breathing. She took a number and then went to the washroom. When she came out, she had to hold herself up against the wall to keep herself from falling. The staff called an ambulance for her and they were there in minutes.</p>
<p>I wonder how we are going to stop the spread of H1N1 when this clinic cannot even hand out masks.</p>

<p>Having four vaccination clinics in Calgary are simply not enough, as some Calgarians had to wait for six hours to receive the H1N1 vaccine Monday.</p>
<p>If it was a case of not wanting to have to pay staff for several more clinics, it backfired as the four clinics had to stay open Monday until 11 p.m. I certainly hope the nurses who were there when the clinic opened at 8:30 a.m. were not the same ones working when it closed.</p>
<p>Setting up just four clinics in Calgary may have saved the government money, but it will cost the Conservatives votes. This is another case of the government not having any idea of what was going on with the general populace.</p>
<p>On the first day, the seasonal flu clinics were very well attended, with some people waiting 3½ hours. There has been much publicity about the importance of getting the H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>Edmonton has a somewhat smaller population than Calgary. Why are there five clinics there and only four in Calgary? I do not begrudge Edmonton the five clinics;I would just like to know the rationale behind this decision. I doubt the premier, MLAs and senior bureaucrats had to wait in line for six hours to get the vaccination. Why does the government think it is acceptable that the public should have to?</p>

<p>Re: "Thousands brave chill for flu shots; Health Services looks for ways to streamline vaccinations; in the meantime, they suggest bringing a book," The Journal, Oct. 27.</p>
<p>Monday, I stood in line for three hours waiting for an H1N1 vaccination. The ground was covered in coffee leaking from dropped cups because there were no garbage cans. There was one bathroom which was difficult to reach because of the crowding. Once I was inside the building, a worker had to write down my health information, to later be transcribed again by another worker into computers. Why do we not just have scannable cards?</p>
<p>Finally, after 2½ hours, we got close to the end of the line and saw the 60 injection stations decrease to 12 as 4:30 rolled around. The staff went for dinner just as people were getting off work and the lines extended around the corner of the building outside. This is an absolute offence to everyone involved and shows a lack of planning.</p>
<p>With scannable cards, and better staffing, we could get through this without making seniors and moms with upset babies wait for hours.</p>
<p>The flu shot takes two weeks to take effect and we're already in the middle of a new outbreak.</p>
<p>Someone must take responsibility and fix this mess.</p>

</p>
<p>With the H1N1 virus being linked to two deaths in recent days of Ontario children 13 and under, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Paediatric Society says parents should be honest with their kids about the virus and try to keep them calm.</p>
<p>Parents have an arsenal of information at their fingertips to keep their families as safe as possible from H1N1, but with otherwise healthy kids dying from H1N1 complications, federal health authorities and pediatric experts are stressing the importance of the H1N1 vaccine and education.</p>
<p>"For children, you have to explain, 'Yes it hurts, but then it's over with,' and then it protects you from getting much sicker," said Dr. Danielle Grenier, medical affairs director for the Canadian Paediatric Society. "Be honest, and get it done--that's No. 1.</p>
<p>"You need to explain that you can get sick with the flu, but if you get the vaccine (your chances) are going down...You have to be very positive and stay away from alarming them . . . They need that reassurance and know that their parents will do everything they can for them."</p>
<p>"It's a good, safe vaccine and it protects 93 to 97 per cent. If you get this virus and get the complications of pneumonia, there's nothing I can give you to make you better, and you'll say, 'I should have (had a shot).</p>
<p>"If we want to protect our loved ones, there's only one way."</p>
<p>Tips to protect your family from H1N1:</p>
<p>-Wash your child's hands, or teach them to wash their own hands, for at least 20 seconds.</p>
<p>-When possible, cover their coughs and sneezes and encourage older children to sneeze into their arms instead of their hands.</p>
<p>-For children over the age of six months, have them receive vaccines for both the seasonal flu and the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>-Talk to your children about germs and how they spread.</p>
<p>-Encourage children to keep their hands away from their faces to avoid the spread of germs.</p>
<p>-Keep children at home from group activities, including day care, if they are ill. Ensure they are free of all symptoms before allowing them to resume group activities.</p>
<p>-Maintain clean surfaces on toys and other surfaces touched by children within the home.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu pandemic could bring down Internet; Web allows creation of 'social distance' to prevent further spread of disease, U.S. agency says</b>
</div><div>David Akin   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>649 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>AU. S. government agency says the Internet in that country could actually break if an H1N1 flu pandemic forced millions to telecommute from home, a finding that has implications for Canada, because the continent's telecommunications backbones are so closely connected.</p>
<p>The U.S. Government Accountability Office(GAO)--an agency whose function closely resembles Canada's auditor general--warned this week that if millions of Americans stayed away from work or school because of the flu, but tried to work or study using home Internet connections, the resulting congestion would bring network traffic to a halt.</p>
<p>"A functioning Internet will be important during a pandemic, because it could be one important way that governments and private entities share necessary information with the public," the GAO said.</p>
<p>"Using the Internet to allow people to communicate effectively without coming together physically would assist in creating 'social distance' to reduce the potential for illness to further spread. In addition, many organizations, including (U. S. public-health officials), have been advocating that businesses and other enterprises consider increased use of telework by their workforce as a way to continue operations, while maintaining physical separation from other workers during a pandemic."</p>
<p>But while the Internet "pipes" are built big enough around office towers or large post-secondary campuses to handle Internet use during a normal workday, the Internet infrastructure that services most residential neighbourhoods is not designed for the kind of intensive use typical of most workplaces, said the GAO.</p>
<p>The GAO warned that government agencies, public-health agencies and other vital services could cease to function, or could function poorly, if Internet access disappeared or was disabled. It also said more planning needed to be done by U.S. government agencies to prepare for such an eventuality.</p>
<p>Industry experts in Canada were divided over their assessment of Canada's Internet infrastructure.</p>
<p>"I think the short answer is that we are probably in worse shape than the U.S.--but both are in bad shape," said Eliott Noss, CEO of <span class="companylink">Tucows Inc</span>. of Toronto, an Internet professional services firm.</p>
<p>"The network was just not built to accommodate pandemics," agreed Eamon Hoey, a Toronto-based analyst at Hoey Associates.</p>
<p>But Telus and <span class="companylink">Bell Canada</span>, the country's biggest telecommunications companies, believe Internet services used by most consumers would remain up and running in most circumstances, and both have taken steps to plan for pandemic-type emergencies.</p>
<p>"Canada's Internet is robust," said Shawn Hall, a spokesman for Telus. Hall said Telus, for example, has made plans so it could continue to provide service if 18,000 of its 35,000 employees were telecommuting from home.</p>
<p>Bill St. Arnaud, the chief research officer at <span class="companylink">Canarie Inc</span>., said there's plenty of spare capacity at the core of the Internet--the big pipes that carry traffic between major metropolitan centres. Canarie is a public sector organization charged with operating and designing superhigh-speed "next generation" data networks.</p>
<p>"Last-mile networks is where some congestion might occur," said St. Arnaud.</p>
<p>"The last mile" is a term Internet engineers use to describe the copper wires and coaxial cable that connects most homes to the higher-bandwidth optical-fibre networks that are located anywhere from a few metres to a kilometre or so from most homes.</p>
<p>"These networks are very lightly loaded," said St. Arnaud. "Their peak congestion is between 4 p.m. and 10 p.m., when kids are downloading music and video. If, in the extreme unlikelihood...of a pandemic, that congestion did become problem, regulators could order carriers to block all video and music traffic. E-mail and web-surfing takes up very little bandwidth."</p>

</div><div>Archie Mclean   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal; With files from the Calgary Herald</div>
<div>327 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>The Alberta Federation of Labour called on the provincial government Wednesday to amend the labour code to protect workers who take days off with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We don't think people who follow the advice of medical professionals should be penalized at their work," AFL president Gil McGowan said.</p>
<p>Alberta's labour code currently doesn't mention sick days and McGowan said it leaves many employees vulnerable if they take Alberta Health Services' advice to stay home when they or their children are feeling ill.</p>
<p>Employment Minister Hector Goudreau said he is happy to meet with the AFL and others to hear their concerns, but he said most workers have already have sick days built into their contracts.</p>
<p>Those that don't should talk to their employers about the possibility of taking time off if they get the flu.</p>
<p>"People should not wait until they're ill to talk to each other," Goudreau said.</p>
<p>"I encourage employers and employees to have it clear up front in case something happens in the workplace."</p>
<p>Either way, Goudreau said he is not interested in opening the labour code.</p>
<p>More than 100,000 flu shots were given to Albertans in the first two days of the immunization campaign. Lineups at local vaccination clinics were generally shorter Wednesday than previous days but lengthy waits remained the norm across the city.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said many of the waits are because the province is giving all Albertans first crack at the shot, not just high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said the program was starting to strain other parts of the health-care system, including emergency rooms and medical clinics. "Over the couple of days I hope that we will be in a position to implement some strategy that will help alleviate that," Liepert said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic snatches toys from children; Day cares, eateries, transit users forced to adjust familiar routines</b>
</div><div>Cigdem Iltan   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>733 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Children at Grandin After School Care no longer play with the same toys they did before the H1N1 virus hit Albertans.</p>
<p>The day care has increased how often staff sanitize toys, and recently closed access to a water table--a large plastic bin full of water that kids could put toys in and play with, day-care executive director Shannon VanderHorst said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We're making sure doorknobs and light switches and other high traffic areas are washed daily," VanderHorst said. The children are now expected to sanitize their hands each time they enter a new room, with sanitizing stations outside of every door, she said.</p>
<p>The day care's 66 children aren't the only ones whose familiar routines have changed since H1N1 arrived.</p>
<p>Christie Acuna now holds her breath and turns her head whenever someone coughs or sneezes, and tries not to touch any surfaces on the bus she takes to and from work every day.</p>
<p>Barry Maksymiuk has changed his schedule so he can take transit during off-peak hours when there aren't as many people around. Maksymiuk said he tries to avoid crowded places where germs are spread more easily.</p>
<p>Anika Rufiange never used to worry about washing her hands, but now she washes her hands at home every day after she gets off the bus.</p>
<p>"It's kind of scary now," Rufiange said.</p>
<p>Avanti Salon & Spa increased its daily surface cleaning of door knobs, handles, counters and telephones to two times a day about three weeks ago, said Julie Ward, director of operations.</p>
<p>"We've relaxed our policy on sick notes because we don't want to overburden the health-care system," she said. The spa is also considering changing its cancellation policy to allow clients who are sick to cancel without penalty, she said.</p>
<p>Planet Organic on Jasper Avenue is in the process of hiring more staff to cover for ones who fall sick, store manager John Howick said. Staff are encouraged to wipe surfaces such as PIN pads, baby seats and shopping cart handles with disinfectant solution more often, he said.</p>
<p>Col. Mustard's Canteen staff have always been diligent about cleanliness, co-owner Carla Pipella said, but wash stations with antibacterial soap and buckets full of bleach and soap solution used to clean surfaces have so far kept staff free from the flu.</p>
<p>"There's always stuff going around, but no one here is ever sick. We wash our hands several times an hour."</p>
<p>Handwashing, hand sanitizer and other approaches help prevent the spread of the virus, but the single best strategy to combat H1N1 is vaccination, said Dr. Marcia Johnson, acting medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services' Edmonton zone.</p>
<p>Although Alberta Health Services deployed more nurses to Edmonton immunization clinics on Wednesday, waiting times at immunization clinics were higher Wednesday than Tuesday, she said.</p>
<p>"Today, we have had a slightly higher demand, so it turns out the wait list was about the same, but definitely more people are going through," Johnson said. "We have plans to train new staff every day."</p>
<p>Johnson was not able to provide the total number of nurses immunizing people at Edmonton's five clinics.</p>
<p>BY THE NUMBERS</p>
<p>A look at H1N1 in Alberta: - 200,000 more vaccine units are expected in Alberta today - 30,000 people received the H1N1 vaccination in the first two days clinics were open - 65 more nurses were deployed Wednesday to deliver the vaccination - 56 of the Edmonton Public Schools district's 195 schools had an absentee rate above 10 per cent on Wednesday-20 more schools than on Tuesday - There have been 12 H1N1-related deaths in Alberta. The most recent death was in Edmonton. - Alberta Health Services hopes 70 per cent of the population will be vaccinated.</p>

<p>- Initiate conversation. Kids on their own can come up with stories often more frightening than the reality. - Ask them what they've heard. Reassure them with the facts. - Keep explanations very simple for younger children. - Assure your children there is no need to be afraid. Doctors and nurses are working hard to limit the spread and help the sick. - Tell your kids the new virus causes a sickness a lot like the ones we see every year, but more people may get sick because the virus is new. - Tell them the most serious pandemic happened almost 100 years ago and even then, before people had access to today's medical knowledge, almost everyone who got sick recovered. - Although some people go to hospital, the majority who got sick in North America got better at home. - Remind your kids of ways to avoid getting sick: wash hands frequently; avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth; don't share cups or utensils; cough or sneeze into a tissue or into your sleeve instead of your hands.</p>

<p>The spectre of H1N1 flu hovers over us all. Parents, at least, have a better grasp than their children of the risks, and can easily put into perspective what is being reported on the flu.</p>
<p>Despite media reports of pandemics and deaths of seemingly healthy</p>
<p>Canadians, kids don't yet appear preoccupied with the issue, according to educators and parents.</p>
<p>"Every kid is different. Some kids are more anxious than others. There's certainly a lot of media attention on H1N1," says Marjorie MacDonald of the University of Victoria's school of nursing.</p>
<p>Child psychologist Magali Brulot says her four-year-old twins haven't talked about the flu, but her six-and seven-year-olds have. It's normal for children to ask questions about H1N1--or any publicized health concern--and to feel some uncertainty or anxiety.</p>
<p>There had been a case of the flu at her son's school, and the person recovered. "I now use this as an example with children I see in my practice," she says.</p>
<p>Mary Mah says her two elementary school-age children aren't worried about H1N1, partly, she suspects, because she's not worried.</p>
<p>Kids take their cues from parents, according to both MacDonald and parental educator Allison Rees.</p>
<p>"If parents are upset and worried, kids pick up on it," MacDonald says.</p>
<p>Rees sees little difference between the spectre of H1N1 and what parents underwent during 9/11. "Kids look to their parents for calmness," she says.</p>
<p>When children bring up these topics, they want reassurance, according to Brulot. Acknowledge your child's emotional reaction and let them know that they are not alone, she says.</p>
<p>"Be matter of fact and talk about generalities. State that there are many different types of flu bugs that go around, some worse than others, and that the best thing we can do as a family is try to stay healthy by eating healthy meals, being active and having good hygiene," Brulot says.</p>

ubiquitous hand sanitizers, now common in schools, are a reminder to
children that H1N1 is out there.

<p>H1N1 Advice</p>
<p>New Book - Talk to anyone these days, it seems, and the subject of H1N1 comes up--along with all kinds of rumours and old wives' tales about how to keep the flu at bay. (Onions, anyone?)</p>
<p>The new book, Swine Flu H1N1: The Facts by Dr. Terence Stephenson (Jessica Kingsley Publishers, $14.95), aims to address some of those concerns.</p>
<p>He knows his stuff; Stephenson is the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and professor of child health and dean of medicine and health sciences at the University of Nottingham.</p>
<p>In the new book, he defines some of the key terms and addresses the claims that ethyl mercury in vaccines leads to autism.</p>
<p>He also gives tips on dealing with H1N1, should you or your child get it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Major companies on watch for H1N1; Labour group concerned about unpaid leave</b>
</div><div>Gina Teel   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>784 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Corporate giants in Calgary have yet to see an uptick in employee absenteeism as flu season, and H1N1 in particular, arrives, but continue to monitor the situation closely and are ready with contingency plans.</p>
<p>That's not to say they've been untouched by H1N1, with <span class="companylink">Shaw Communications Inc</span>. reporting one employee seriously sick with the influenza virus and on a respirator in Calgary.</p>
<p>"That's probably demographically about normal for a company our size to have some representation," Shaw president Peter Bissonnette said Wednesday.</p>
<p>With more than 10,000 employees across the country, Calgary-based Shaw has a pandemic plan in place for shift coverage and employees available to cover off should staff fall ill.</p>
<p>Sick employees are encouraged to stay home up to seven days, he said, noting they've had employees who've reported H1N1 symptoms and stayed home and recovered.</p>
<p>Shaw's sick leave benefits provide time off with pay.</p>
<p>"The days of being a hero and coming to work sick are not prescribed anymore," said Bissonnette, who got his H1N1 shot on Tuesday and is encouraging all Shaw employees to follow suit.</p>
<p>Not all employers in Alberta independently provide paid or unpaid sick leave, however, leaving thousands of workers, especially those in low-wage, service sector jobs, with little protection if they follow doctors advice and stay home if experiencing H1N1 symptoms, said the Alberta Federation of Labour.</p>
<p>Federation president Gil McGowan said the Alberta Employment Standard code doesn't say anything at all about sick leave, unlike employment standards codes in six other Canadian jurisdictions that give workers the protections they need.</p>
<p>"As a result, many workers don't have the confidence that they need to do the right thing and take themselves out of circulation if they are experiencing H1N1 symptoms," said McGowan, himself calling from home as he started feeling unwell during the day.</p>
<p>If the Alberta government is serious about slowing the spread of the H1N1 flu virus, it should amend the provincial code to include protections for such workers, he said.</p>
<p>Employment and Immigration Minister Hector Goudreau said he's willing to talk to the federation about its concerns, but he doesn't plan to alter the labour code.</p>
<p>"The majority of the contracts out there include sick-leave provisions," he said.</p>
<p>For workers who don't have such contracts, Goudreau encouraged them and their employers to talk about H1N1 plans.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Agrium Inc</span>. hasn't as of yet seen a noticeable increase in absenteeism among its 400 employees at its Calgary head office, said company spokesman Richard Downey.</p>
<p>Agrium employees are strongly encouraged to stay home when sick and managers are encouraging employees to get flu shots, he said.</p>
<p>"We have spent a considerable amount of effort to ensure employees can work from home for the corporate head office, and contingency plans are in place at our wholesale facilities," he wrote in an e-mail.</p>
<p>Agrium, North America's third-largest fertilizer maker, has a paid sick leave policy for employees at its Calgary corporate office and sick leave policy for its entire operation, but the specifics of those vary depending on the location of the operations.</p>
<p>Agrium has 10,000 employees in total, including its retail operations in the United States.</p>
<p>It's all quiet so far on the energy front, too. <span class="companylink">EnCana Corp</span>. hasn't experienced any unusual bouts of absenteeism due to flu, said spokeswoman Carol Howes.</p>
<p>Likewise, <span class="companylink">Talisman Energy</span> hasn't experienced an epidemic of flu cases but is taking the H1N1 threat seriously, said spokeswoman Phoebe Buckland.</p>
<p>"We have a program and it's based around education and prevention," she said.</p>
<p>Imperial Oil spokesman Pius Rolheiser said the company hasn't noticed any unusual absences or indications of flu among employees.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the company continues to monitor the situation and promote awareness among staff, he said.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. hasn't experienced a spike in employee absenteeism, either.</p>
<p>Airline spokesman Richard Bartrem said WestJet has more front-line people than it needs at any one time, and so can draw on its employee base to cover off should a percentage of staffers be off sick.</p>
<p>Office staff, meanwhile, have the capability to work from home.</p>
<p>"We're asking our employees to exercise common sense, that if you believe you have the symptoms and to be contagious to stay at home, and in turn we're able to do that because they are still able to work from home," Bartrem said.</p>

<p>Transvestites On Trial</p>
<p>Five Filipino transvestites have gone on trial in Shanghai, accused of drugging men with adulterated foods before robbing them in a city with a reputation for adventurous nightlife. Five men allegedly dressed as women and, after leading the victims into taxis or hotel rooms, induced them to eat chocolate laced with "sleeping drugs", the trial heard Wednesday.</p>

<p>Re: "Clinics added as death toll rises," Oct. 28.</p>
<p>I never fail to be amazed by our provincial government's stupidity. They set up four clinics for H1N1 shots in Calgary, which were able to do 8,000 people in Calgary, according to reports. With that rate or inoculation for a city of one million people, it would take 100 days to get everyone vaccinated. A monkey with a calculator would have done a better job than the individuals running our health care.</p>

<p>My 27-year-old niece is fighting for her life. She has H1N1. She has no pre-existing medical conditions except asthma as a child. She is active and leads a healthy life. She is now in a medically induced coma, on a lung bypass machine and a respirator. We do not know if she will survive, and if she does, what her life will look like after this nightmare is over. Our family cannot imagine our world without her joyful spirit in it. What needs to happen for people to understand that this is not a normal, innocuous flu? You have what she didn't have, an immunization that can protect you. Yes, there are risks with the vaccine, but your risks of getting seriously ill, or dying are much greater than your risk from the vaccine. If you do not take the vaccine for you, then take it for the people who love you, who cannot imagine their world without you in it.</p>

</p>
<p>Nurse Meg tells me I could be cranky. As she prepares to plunge the needle into my left arm, she tells me that irritability is one of the potential side effects of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Bring it on, I tell her. I could use a does of ill temper. It will put me in the right frame of mind to rip into Ron Liepert and the Alberta Health superboard for their bungled handling of the H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>Calgary, a city of one million people, had but four flu clinics ready for clients on Monday, resulting in lineups of six hours. Winnipeg, population 648,000, had 12.</p>
<p>"We are not animals. We pay our taxes. They need to cut back on those bonuses," flu vaccine client Laura Brasil told the Herald's Rick Donkers as she waited in a long line at the Olympic Oval, where a fifth clinic was opened Wednesday for pregnant women, children and seniors.</p>
<p>As a part-time caregiver to a 94-year-old woman who recently suffered two heart attacks, I, too, lined up for an H1N1 shot Wednesday, fully expecting the experience to be like a Soviet department store at Christmas. But exactly one hour and one minute later, I was vaccinated. Another 15 minutes to wait for any potential side effects and I was cleared to go.</p>
<p>The whole thing was relatively easy. Either people were scared off by the horror stories from Monday or things had become more efficient with the opening the clinic at the Olympic Oval. Here's how it went:</p>
<p>12:15 p.m.--I'm searching for the locations of Calgary's vaccination clinics on the Alberta Health website, which is pathetic. Nowhere on the main page of the site is there any indication of where to go. It's an Easter egg hunt. It takes several minutes of clicking on various links before I find it. I decide on the Avenida Village location south of Anderson Road on Macleod Trail.</p>
<p>1:37 p.m.--Turn into mall parking lot. A guy working traffic control tells me to park on the street. Shop owners have "no parking" signs in front of their stores. One owner tells me business is bad because of all the flu clients. I easily find a spot on street.</p>
<p>1:47 p.m.--In the outdoor lineup waiting to get into the clinic. It's sunny and 4 degrees with a chilly wind. Shouldn't have left my tuque in the car.</p>
<p>1:54--We've moved a few paces. Behind me is a woman, 18 weeks pregnant, with two kids--a three-year-old boy and a Grade 7 girl. She's on her cellphone to her doctor's clinic after hearing a rumour they have the vaccine. They don't.</p>
<p>Because she is under 20 weeks gestation, she tells me she should only get the unadjuvanted H1N1 vaccine. This is not correct, according to the Alberta Health website, which recommends pregnant women get the adjuvanted vaccine if infection rates are high and it is the only one available. Only the adjuvanted vaccine is available at the clinic, so she says she'll wait.</p>
<p>"I figured I'd at least get the kids vaccinated so nobody in the house can infect me," she says. Confusion is still rampant.</p>
<p>2:03 p.m.-- "Is it me or is it minus 1000?" the pregnant woman's shivering daughter asks. A sign in the window of real estate office invites people inside to warm up. "Sorry, we can't offer washroom facilities," it reads.</p>
<p>2:17--The line is moving nicely. The pregnant mom leaves her two kids in line with me to find a washroom.</p>
<p>2:23 p.m.--A middle age man takes one look at the lineup. "This is nuts. I'll take my chance with the flu," he says, and walks away.</p>
<p>2:25 p.m.--We are outside the clinic, looking through the glass. "Stop the spread of influenza. If you have a cough and are not feeling well, please go home," reads an Alberta Health sign taped to the glass.</p>
<p>2:27 p.m.--Almost at the door. "I have a pretty cold nose," says one woman. The chill is getting to people.</p>
<p>2:33 p.m.--Finally inside. After filling out a form, I'm with a dozen others getting a briefing from a nurse named Lindsay, who is losing her voice from talking so much. She tells us about potential reactions, which are typically minor and pass within two days.</p>
<p>2:39--In another line now, waiting to get vaccinated. The guy behind me is coughing. Kids are crying. The room is noisy. I wash my hands with disinfectant foam at a dispenser.</p>
<p>2:48 p.m.--Nurse Meg has injected me with the vaccine.</p>
<p>Everyone is told to wait 15 minutes before leaving. "It didn't hurt at all. They were really good," says the woman next to me.</p>
<p>And they were.</p>
<p>The one obvious thing in this turbulent mess is that front-line health care workers are friendly, efficient and professional and worth every stingy penny they get.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ignatieff looks for rescue outside of loyalist crowd</b>

</p>
<p>Whenever Liberals gaze longingly into their scotch, reminiscing about those bygone days of government power and payoff glory, they sometimes whisper the name 'Peter Donolo' with mythical reverence.</p>
<p>Today we play Inside Baseball by noting that, 10 years after leaving politics for a series of patronage and polling jobs, the same Donolo who served as Jean Chretien's communications guru returns as Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff's top sidekick.</p>
<p>If the news of his return is any indication, the myth is no longer the man as he launches a mission to salvage his political alma mater from its slide toward oblivion.</p>
<p>The appointment leaked out Tuesday afternoon. Confusion reigned. Liberal apologists didn't know what to say or do. The data was repeatedly denied by a communications director who is, incidentally, the partner of the chief of staff now being metaphorically thrown under Ignatieff's bus.</p>
<p>Finally, around 9:30 p.m., Ignatieff confirmed what his flack had repeatedly denied: Peter the Great Communicator was coming back. More staff changes to follow.</p>
<p>It was an inauspicious start for someone striving to bring order to communications chaos. It's also a sign of Ignatieff's ramped-up desperation that he's gassing his most loyal followers, the very people who lured him onto the magic carpet ride toward Parliament Hill, while issuing a mayday call for help from the Jean Chretien era.</p>
<p>After all, he had already imported a tenacious partisan from Chretien's era named Warren Kinsella to run backroom operations, although his most recent brainstorm to have MP Wayne Easter ambush Conservative MPs emerging from their caucus meeting flopped spectacularly when they discovered the room was empty.</p>
<p>Still, the staff changes are a welcome indication Ignatieff recognizes his situation is so dire that he must sacrifice diehard internal loyalty for outside adult supervision.</p>
<p>Changing a few names on the Official Opposition Leader's organization chart can only do so much to brake an astounding reversal of fortunes for Liberals that no amount of stimulus scandal seems to be registering.</p>
<p>But Ignatieff's line of attack Wednesday against what increasingly appears to be a botched swine flu immunization blitz, of which some blame clearly falls on federal shoulders, at least hit the government where it hurt.</p>
<p>Despite having six months to prepare the immunization program for a second-stage pandemic, a colossal failure of communications is rolling out across Canada with provinces posting different rules for varying patients needlessly huddled for hours in germ-exchanging crowds.</p>
<p>This should be Iggy's priority issue.</p>
<p>While there's something pathetic about seeing significance in those hired to give a leader advice on where they stand, what to say and how to see with long-range vision, it's increasingly obvious Ignatieff needs professional help adjusting to life as a leader in a country he's mostly avoided.</p>
<p>There's no doubt Donolo will help his boss avoid amateur-hour mistakes ( "Stephen Harper, your time is up") and better interpret the meaning behind polls that have all the consistency of a yo-yo.</p>
<p>If he can keep the question period focus on swine flu immunization hiccups or medical isotope shortages, the sort of tangibles that actually impact Canadians, it would connect more efficiently than selective stimulus attacks which have failed to register.</p>
<p>But if nothing else, having a proven talent who was in a lucrative private sector job return to stake his reputation on a loser-look-alike is a promising sign.</p>
<p>The last place any rational Liberal would settle now is in the office of a leader less popular than Stephane Dion at his worst. Peter Donolo must see hope in what appears to be a hopeless scenario.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Schools focus on cleanliness as absentee rates eclipse 10%</b>
</div><div>Eva Ferguson, with files from Renata D'Aliesio, Calgary
Herald   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>612 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Dozens of Calgary schools are reporting absentee rates of higher than 10 per cent, sending letters home and doubling their cleaning efforts as H1N1 fears envelop the city and its young families.</p>
<p>School officials say they'll continue to brace for increasing rates of absenteeism in students and eventually teachers, although they can't say whether kids are calling in sick with colds, coughs, seasonal flu or H1N1.</p>
<p>Janet Sutherland, spokeswoman for the Calgary Catholic School District, confirmed 15 Catholic schools have surpassed 10 per cent absenteeism, up slightly from last week.</p>
<p>"There are several schools where we've sent letters home to parents where absenteeism is at or above 10 per cent," said Sutherland.</p>
<p>Ted Flitton, spokesman for the Calgary Board of Education, estimated between 30 and 40 schools are reporting higher than 10 per cent absenteeism this week.</p>
<p>At the 10 per cent mark, both boards say schools will immediately send letters home and begin to clean high-touch areas, not once, but twice daily.</p>
<p>High-touch areas include counters, desktops, doorknobs, lunchroom tables and all bathrooms.</p>
<p>Sutherland explained all affected buildings have at least one caretaker or caretaking assistant on site to ensure cleaning is done twice.</p>
<p>Teachers also continue to be encouraged to remind students about regular handwashing, coughing or sneezing into sleeves rather than hands, and staying home when feeling unwell, Flitton added.</p>
<p>But facilities are not looking at closing their doors once they reach a certain number of absent students. Even rates as high as 50 per cent would not prompt closures.</p>
<p>Only if too many teachers fall ill to run a school would a facility consider shutting down, Flitton explained.</p>
<p>But parents continue to be fearful and frustrated, asking why students can't be vaccinated at schools.</p>
<p>Sylvia Norman, whose Grade 1 daughter attends West Dover Elementary, said she hasn't had time to stand in line for several hours this week, and probably won't next week, either.</p>
<p>"I would have liked to have seen them give the vaccines in schools. It would have been much easier."</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said Tuesday H1N1 immunization clinics in schools will likely occur after people in higher risk categories receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Ultimately the intent would likely (be) to be in schools, but not until after we get the high-risk done," he said.</p>
<p>Education Minister Dave Hancock encouraged parents, educators and students to take proper precautions.</p>
<p>"The key here is not to panic. We know that there's a flu season on and we know that the H1N1 virus is coming," he said.</p>
<p>Liberal education critic Harry Chase argued students could easily be vaccinated at schools since all students are already getting booster shots annually in Grades 5 and 9.</p>
<p>"We already have a system in place. Why can't we draw upon it, augment it, and have the kids immunized at school," Chase said.</p>
<p>"They knew this was coming since September; they knew when the vaccine would be arriving. They could have coordinated things much better than this."</p>
<p>Chase said his daughter is reluctant to vaccinate her kindergarten-aged son who is asthmatic because he might become ill having to wait in a line outdoors for several hours.</p>
<p>"It's just not right that people at risk are being put into these kinds of positions."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Travel deals abound amid H1N1 outbreak; Agents expect business to remain brisk</b>
</div><div>Tamara Gignac, with files from Gina Teel, Calgary Herald   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald;</div>
<div>509 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>There are plenty of beach bargains this winter and flu fears shouldn't get in the way of holiday plans, travel agents say.</p>
<p>Resorts and cruise lines are slashing rates and offering special incentives to lure travellers south and fill rooms, whether it's deals on dining and drinks or extra hotel nights and two-for-one specials.</p>
<p>It comes as federal health authorities issued a warning to Canadians on Wednesday to cancel or rebook travel planes on trains, buses and ferries if they suspect they are ill with the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The government also urged everyone from bus drivers to flight attendants to keep watch for potentially sick passengers.</p>
<p>But travel agents believe business will remain brisk even as the industry braces for the second wave of H1N1, which has so far has contributed to dozens of deaths in Canada and hundreds of hospitalizations in the country since April.</p>
<p>Many resort properties in sunny destinations are offering steep discounts--especially in Mexico, where an earlier outbreak of H1N1 has already taken a toll on tourism.</p>
<p>The travel industry hopes bargain prices--and a soaring loonie--will translate into a surge in bookings during the peak winter season.</p>
<p>"There's going to be lots of deals out there . . . I don't think the market has come back as quickly as people thought," said Andrew Hopkyns, director of business development at AMA Travel.</p>
<p>Hopkyns doesn't believe fears about a flu outbreak will keep clients from travelling.</p>
<p>He recommends people take precautionary measures instead. " You should always have travel insurance--and H1N1 is no different from anything else," said Hopkyns.</p>
<p>Many insurance plans provide cancellation options as well as medical coverage in the event a client falls ill while away from home, and can be purchased through a travel agency or the airline.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines</span> spokesman Richard Bartrem said the carrier currently has no plans to alter its change and cancellation policy, noting it already provides flexibility. Travellers are allowed to cancel or change a booking within 24 hours. After that period, it's a $50 fee.</p>
<p>The same rules for switching or cancelling travel dates still apply for Air Canada passengers. "This is a fluid situation . . . and we will respond appropriately to developments," spokeswoman Angela Mah said Wednesday.</p>
<p>It's a different story for some airlines south of the border, where many states and cities are struggling to obtain enough H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">United Airlines</span> said it will waive the cost of changing a ticket, provided the passenger has a doctor's note. Other carriers said they will make decisions on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p>It's simply too early to tell how the current flu season will unfold, said Donavon Gaudette of the Association of Canadian Travel Agents.</p>
<p>"We were expecting a lot of negativity to certain areas, especially Mexico. But people understand that H1N1 is a global issue."</p>

</p>
<p>That Mark Giordano fought one of the Edmonton Oilers on Saturday is no big deal.</p>
<p>What provides the twist, however, is that his opponent, Ladislav Smid, has since tested positive for H1N1.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine closer quarters than two hockey players fighting.</p>
<p>"It's in the back of your mind, I guess," Giordano, a defenceman for the Calgary Flames, said Wednesday morning. "There was nothing I could really do. At the time, I obviously didn't know. I don't think he knew, either.</p>
<p>"But it's one of those things --the virus is going around, so you have to be careful."</p>
<p>The topic is indeed a hot one.</p>
<p>The Flames, on Wednesday night, faced the Colorado Avalanche, who were missing goalie Peter Budaj, a confirmed H1N1 case.</p>
<p>"Hopefully, it doesn't get too much worse than it has," said Giordano. "It's definitely an eye-opener.</p>
<p>"It is a little bit scary whenever a virus or something like that is going around. The only thing we can do, as players, is be extra careful."</p>
<p>Flames centre Dustin Boyd, sidelined with the flu, didn't play Wednesday. And he wasn't around for the morning skate, either.</p>
<p>His presence, in one way, was still felt--because Eric Nystrom made sure that he was using a water bottle dedicated to only him.</p>
<p>"I feel great, but my roommate is obviously sick, so I'm taking every precaution to make sure the team is safe," said Nystrom, who shares a loft with Boyd in downtown Calgary. "Just because I live with him, I'm making sure that, if there is anything, I don't spread it around."</p>
<p>The Flames currently have no policy in place, at least not one they're making public.</p>
<p>"We're going by the advice of the team doctors and doing the things that are necessary," said Flames coach Brent Sutter. "Hopefully, it's not going to get inside our (locker) room."</p>
<p>Besides, Sutter pointed out, the virus is hardly a hockey-only issue.</p>
<p>"I'm going to ask you the question -- for society, is it a concern?" said the coach. "Why are professional athletes any different? It's something that's talked about in the papers everyday.</p>
<p>"There's an awareness by everybody, not just hockey players, not just professional athletes. It's in society."</p>
<p>The Flames have yet to get vaccinations.</p>
<p>"With the lineups in Calgary right now, we, unfortunately, haven't had the opportunity to go do it," said defenceman Robyn Regehr. "It's something that I want to do. It's something that's important to do."</p>
<p>As precautions, according to Regehr, there are hand sanitizers in the Flames'weight room and a strict hand-washing policy in place.</p>
<p>"And if guys are sick at all, it's very important to keep those guys away from the team, so there's not a spread," said Regehr. "Because we're around each other so much that once it does infiltrate a team, then it can be very, very bad."</p>

<p>Henry Burris has been getting flu shots for years now, and will continue that tradition with his family some time next week.</p>
<p>But the Calgary Stampeders quarterback is bucking conventional wisdom by deciding against getting the H1N1 vaccination, despite the team planning to offer the vaccinations once it can purchase a supply of the medicine.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't get it, but that's my choice," said Burris on Wednesday. "It's all about risk versus gain, and I've felt fine ever since I started getting the flu vaccinations, so my whole logic is that if it isn't broke, don't fix it. There have been different strains of the virus here and there, but I feel like it all works from the most basic one.</p>
<p>"H1N1 is something to be concerned with, but I feel if you're going around taking the proper steps to keep yourself in healthy living conditions, making sure you're aware of your surroundings, keeping your hands washed, making sure that people cover their mouths when they cough or sneeze, I think you should be fine."</p>
<p>The Stamps are doing their best to cover all their bases in that department. Pat Clayton, the team's longtime director of medical services, said players have separate towels and drinking bottles and, like the office staff, are encouraged to use hand sanitizers as much as possible. As well, the locker-room washing and toilet facilities are disinfected daily.</p>
<p>But those measures, said Clayton, were in place long before the H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>"We're very careful about cleanliness of all things in the facility," he said. "In this environment, transmission of disease is a problem.</p>
<p>"But there's no doubt (that H1N1 could be a serious problem), and that's why we're as proactive as we are. Everyone is cognizant of it; when you see 13-year-old hockey players dying, it's a real wake-up call that people need to get going and get this done."</p>
<p>Players and staff were offered in-house flu vaccinations last week--the organization purchased its supply-- and Clayton's understanding is that supplies of the H1N1 vaccine will be made available for purchase to doctors and pharmacists next week, and the team plans to take advantage.</p>
<p>"The (health) region is very cognizant of making sure that everybody has equal access, which we most certainly support," said Clayton. "We don't want to jump any lines.</p>
<p>"I don't know that sports teams should have a different priority than others in the normal population. I think it's a matter of the health region rolling this out in appropriate fashion so that anybody can get it done. Just the same as any other business, we will try to take care of our employees."</p>
<p>Veteran centre Rob Lazeo said the players have the responsibility to make sure they're taking as many precautions as possible.</p>
<p>"Wash your hands whenever you can, right?" he said. "But we're among 60 or 70 guys touching the same things, using the same stuff (equipment).When the sickness hits a locker-room, it hits it hard, right? How can you stop it? When somebody's sick, stay home."</p>
<p>Burris has his mind made up, and while Clayton is a proponent of getting the H1N1 vaccination, he and the team can't enforce it.</p>
<p>"We don't require anybody to get it done," he said.</p>
<p>"We offer it to them, and fortunately we have a reasonably high percentage who take advantage of it. But it's their decision. We just make it as easily available to them as possible."</p>

<p>As concern mounts about the spread of the H1N1 or swine flu virus, IKEA is keeping its play areas very clean.</p>
<p>The store's supervised ballroom, in which kids romp and cavort among multicoloured balls, is being sterilized and cleaned daily as part of the retailer's precautionary measures.</p>
<p>"The slides and climbers are also cleaned and sterilized every day, and we're not allowing kids who are sick in the play area," said company spokeswoman Madeline Frick. "We do have a pandemic preparedness plan."</p>
<p>Frick said IKEA has no plans to close the play areas in its stores, and did not do so at the height of the SARS scare in Toronto in 2003.</p>
<p>All sorts of organizations are taking precautions. Calgary Transit is aggressively sanitizing C-Trains and buses, especially surfaces that lots of people touch.</p>
<p>Tom Sampson, the deputy chief of the city's Emergency Management Agency, said any time a lot of people congregate in one area, there will be varying degrees of hygiene.</p>
<p>He also says that an area only remains clean until the next person comes along and touches it. That means people have to take their own measures to prevent catching H1N1, such as frequent hand washing.</p>
<p>"You cannot control the environment that you go out into," Sampson said. "You can't walk around wrapped up in bubble wrap, not touching anything. So, the end thing that you can control is that environment that's immediately around you . . . the number of times that you choose to clean your hands or the number of times you choose the clean the surfaces in which you work."</p>

<p>T he Alberta Liberals challenged the Conservative government on Wednesday to detail how it will handle a worst-case H1N1 pandemic, which could see as many as 2,850 Albertans require intensive hospital care and up to 400 deaths.</p>
<p>The figures are outlined in Alberta Health Services' latest H1N1 response plan.</p>
<p>At its worst, the new strain of influenza could affect a quarter of the population--about 875,000 Albertans-- during the second wave this fall and winter. This scenario could result in the hospitalization of between 3,800 and 11,400 patients, of whom 15 to 25 per cent are expected to need intensive care.</p>
<p>The health board's pandemic plan suggests H1N1 could contribute to between 130 and 400 deaths in Alberta, compared with roughly 17 deaths annually due to seasonal influenza. The province has so far recorded 12 deaths linked to H1N1, three of them since Friday.</p>
<p>In light of these stark numbers, Liberal Leader David Swann questioned whether Alberta has enough acute-care hospital beds to handle a possible surge in patients.</p>
<p>"Alberta's major hospitals and intensive care units are routinely at 100 per cent capacity," Swann noted in question period Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Where are you going to find 570 beds for intensive care patients?" he asked Health Minister Ron Liepert.</p>
<p>Liepert said the province's immediate focus is on immunizing as many Albertans as possible to keep people from getting sick and to reduce strain on the health system.</p>
<p>But if the worst-case scenario surfaces, Liepert assured hospital beds will be available.</p>
<p>"Pandemic planning is extensive to the point where you should have in place the most extreme situation," Liepert said.</p>
<p>But NDP Leader Brian Mason suggested Alberta's health system is already straining to handle both H1N1 and daily medical issues.</p>
<p>"Failure to ensure appropriate staffing levels to accommodate for a public health outbreak has left the system unable to cope," Mason said in the legislature.</p>
<p>"It creates serious doubts about Alberta's capacity to cope with any health emergency."</p>

<p>Hospitals around Alberta are seeing a rapid increase in patients and dozens of Calgary schools are reporting higher absentee rates as a second wave of H1N1 influenza hits the province.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said city emergency rooms have been so busy, medical staff have been moved from other areas of the hospital to help.</p>
<p>The health superboard also said its HealthLink telephone hotline has been "very busy" fielding calls from people concerned about H1N1.</p>
<p>At Alberta Children's Hospital on Wednesday, worried parents with sick children crowded the ER, many wearing surgical masks as they waited to see a physician.</p>
<p>Health officials did not have statistics on average wait times, but families said they were waiting at least three hours to see a doctor in the morning.</p>
<p>Dozens of people filled the emergency waiting room at Peter Lougheed Hospital over the dinner hour, many coughing under their surgical masks.</p>
<p>One of those was Jessika Alexander, 20, who said she fell ill Tuesday night.</p>
<p>"I was lying in bed and all of a sudden I started coughing and felt pain all over, from my head down to my toes.</p>
<p>"I've never felt this kind of pain and soreness in all my life. I don't know if I have the swine flu, but whatever this is, it's awful," said Alexander.</p>
<p>Health officials say the medical system is coping so far.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing now compared to the summer is greatly increased influenza activity in the community," said Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health for the superboard.</p>

<p>"We were anticipating this; we heard about the waves of pandemic, and this is indeed the second wave," said MacDonald.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert said Wednesday that emergency wards and medical clinics in the rest of the province are also experiencing an increase in patients and inquiries connected to H1N1 concerns.</p>
<p>The influx is causing some strain on the health system, which the province is looking to address.</p>
<p>"Over the couple of days I hope that we will be in a position to implement some strategy that will help alleviate that," Liepert said at the legislature.</p>
<p>News of the increase in cases comes on the first week of Alberta's massive campaign to vaccinate residents against H1N1, the virus also known as swine flu that first emerged in Mexico during the spring and has since spread around the world.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services said the number of suspected H1N1 cases in schools also appears to be growing this week, with dozens of Calgary schools reporting absentee rates of higher than 10 per cent.</p>
<p>"We have had in place for many, many years the relationship with schools to contact public health when their absenteeism rate goes above 10 per cent," said the superboard's MacDonald.</p>
<p>"What we're seeing now, I've never seen before."</p>
<p>But Education Minister Dave Hancock urged calm. "The key here is not to panic," he added.</p>
<p>While H1N1 has mostly caused mild disease, officials say some patients are being hospitalized and, in rare cases, are being admitted to intensive care units.</p>
<p>In total, nearly 200 Albertans with H1N1 have been admitted to hospital since the new strain of influenza first began spreading in the spring.</p>
<p>But physicians say only those who need medical attention should visit emergency rooms and that healthy people with mild symptoms can recover at home.</p>
<p>MacDonald said people who are having trouble breathing, experiencing chest pain or are running a fever for more than four days should see a physician.</p>
<p>She added that patients should look at Alberta Health Services'website to learn how to manage mild illness at home before calling HealthLink.</p>
<p>At Alberta Children's Hospital Wednesday, several parents said they came to emergency because their child had flu-like symptoms and they were worried after a healthy Toronto boy--Evan Frustaglio-- died from H1N1 this week.</p>
<p>"The story about the 13-year-old in Ontario has panicked parents," said Bert Hamilton, whose nine-year-old son was waiting in emergency at Alberta Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach also said two recent H1N1-related deaths--Frustaglio and another young Canadian --are likely weighing heavily on the minds of many Albertans.</p>
<p>He encouraged people who aren't</p>
<p>feeling well and who are unsure of what's wrong to phone HealthLink and speak to nurses or touch base with their family doctor.</p>
<p>"We will work through it," the premier told reporters in Calgary.</p>
<p>Rahim Mohammed said he went to his neighbourhood medical clinic before visiting the emergency room at Peter Lougheed.</p>
<p>"My doctor took one look at me and gave me a letter that said to get to emergency right away," said Mohammed, 30.</p>
<p>He was lying in a waiting room chair, wrapped in a hospital sheet, wearing a tuque and shivering.</p>
<p>He said he was fine one day and violently ill by Wednesday.</p>
<p>"At first I thought it was a cold and now I feel like I am dying, like it's killing me."</p>
<p>As hospitals deal with an increase in patients, the provincial campaign to immunize Albertans against H1N1 administered more than 100,000 shots in its first two days.</p>
<p>In Calgary alone, health officials say they've vaccinated 28,000 residents of the city and surrounding rural areas, plus some 9,000 health workers.</p>
<p>Liepert, who quietly toured Edmonton clinics and emergency rooms on Wednesday, said in the legislature the vaccination program is an "incredible success" because of the high turnout.</p>
<p>The program has been heavily criticized for long lineups and only a handful of clinics in Calgary and Edmonton to serve the province's two largest cities.</p>
<p>In Calgary, Alberta Health Services added a fifth clinic at the University of Calgary's Olympic Oval to serve people who have trouble standing in line, including the elderly and pregnant women. Still, patients who went to the clinic Wednesday faced multi-hour waits.</p>
<p>"It was the largest line ever," said Andrea Naderi, who waited about three hours with her two children. "It's great that it is inside, but it could have been run better."</p>
<p>By mid-morning, the lineup at the clinic stretched through the university's kinesiology complex and several people chose not to wait.</p>
<p>"We talked to lots of families that are turning back and that is sad," said Gerry Webster, 73, who left after estimating the wait could have been about seven hours.</p>
<p>Health officials said they are doing their best to accommodate the large crowds, but they do not have any plans at this time to add another Calgary clinic.</p>
<p>Stelmach said many of the waits are due to the fact that the province is giving all Albertans first crack at the shot, not just high-risk groups. He noted in other provinces where long lines haven't been an issue that the vaccine is only to be offered to high-risk groups for now, while the general population must wait.</p>
<p>"We'll be doing whatever we can to vaccinate the whole population," the premier said.</p>

</p>
<p>The dreaded H1N1 flu shot lineup actually turned out to be relatively easy and almost fun in a masochistic way.</p>
<p>I went to the Richmond Road clinic at the old Children's Hospital on Wednesday at about 7:20 a.m., hoping to stroll in for my shot when the clinic opened at 8:30.</p>
<p>Good luck.</p>
<p>The line already extended back down the hallway from the vaccination room, into a lobby and beyond.</p>
<p>And it was even bigger than it seemed, because dads and grandparents were staking out spots for their families.</p>
<p>The moms and kids arrived around opening time and jostled apologetically into line. Nobody complained. Who would? Children are at much higher risk for serious swine flu.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the line started moving quickly. Despite the expanding crowd ahead, I was vaccinated and out the door by 9:30, two hours and 10 minutes after my arrival.</p>
<p>That was a lot sooner than expected. I'd estimated four hours, based on experience with a seasonal flu shot Oct. 13.</p>
<p>They've sped things up with smoother systems and more people. My arm was jabbed by a cheery operating room nurse who said she'd been pulled off the ward to help.</p>
<p>All around, the deep concern of parents was both touching and reassuring.</p>
<p>One man was worried about his four children, aged 11 years to nine months, especially after reading about the 13-year-old hockey player who died so quickly in Ontario.</p>
<p>These parents aren't swayed by the nutbar movement of suicidal survivalists (surely the weirdest contradiction of our time) who see the vaccine as some kind of international plot.</p>
<p>Listening to these crackpots, I wonder how 50 million Spanish flu dead from 1918-19 would have felt.</p>
<p>Those victims would have been overjoyed by the sudden arrival of a vaccine to protect them and their loved ones.</p>
<p>In the days before inoculation, antibiotics and ventilators, Spanish flu killed 50,000 Canadians.</p>
<p>Worldwide, for six months, a million people died every week. The younger ones were most at risk, as they are today.</p>
<p>The sinister parallels explain why every sane public health doctor is so scared. They are not making this up.</p>
<p>But too many younger people have lost their fear because vaccination has eradicated plagues.</p>
<p>Frankly, the deniers scare the hell out of me. By scoffing at vaccination, they and their children will become the new breeding ground for old horrors.</p>
<p>Fear is only common sense for anyone who has seen real epidemics.</p>
<p>I remember vividly the day my parents started talking excitedly about a new vaccine for polio.</p>
<p>My mom literally shed tears of joy. Dr. Jonas Salk, one key developer, became an instant international hero.</p>
<p>I'd already seen kids drop away around me, to return months later in leg braces. Some didn't come back at all.</p>
<p>But not until that day in 1955 did I understand how terrified my parents had been.</p>
<p>So it seems ridiculous to get upset about a few hours' wait for protection against an entirely new flu.</p>
<p>Shoot us up, Mr. Duckett. Vaccinate every last Albertan.</p>
<p>Despite all the problems and access worries in rural areas, the province has done exactly the right thing by making shots available quickly to as many people as possible.</p>
<p>In B.C., the government isn't even releasing the vaccine to the general public for at least two more weeks.</p>
<p>Manitoba is the only other province doing mass vaccinations. The rest have the vaccine, but they're dithering dangerously.</p>
<p>When I left the clinic, the line was much longer and people no longer looked quite so accepting.</p>
<p>But they were stoical. Everybody with any sense knows a few hours is a trivial sacrifice to stop a plague.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Beautiful Day for U2 fans at BC Place; Irish rockers land in Vancouver with Black Eyed Peas in tow</b>
</div><div>Graeme McRanor   </div>
<div>Special to The Sun</div>
<div>1116 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final C</div><div>D10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>U2</p>
<p>Black Eyed Peas</p>
<p>Wednesday night</p>
<p>BC Place</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Reportedly, U2's 360 tour requires anywhere from 120 to 189 trucks and buses to haul its giantclaw-like stage and the 500-strong crew needed for the production around North America.</p>
<p>Add to that the band's private jet and its 70,000 miles logged over the course of the two-year, worldwide tour and, well, that's a pretty substantial carbon footprint.</p>
<p>However, if you were to believe the spin from a certain American music rag, the timing for such a colossal greenhouse fart couldn't be better.</p>
<p>After all, with the world mired in its various crises, they argue, what better time to tour with such an audacious, irresponsible rock spectacular?</p>
<p>And that's probably true, if you're the type of person who thinks it's kosher for a company to throw a lavish Christmas party for its management the day after laying off 90 per cent of its staff.</p>
<p>Then again, this is U2. The biggest band on the planet, in case you haven't heard. And, frankly, whatever irrevocable damage to the environment a giant, upside-down claw in the midst of an elaborate goliath of a live show causes, it's at least less annoying than some of the hot air frontman Bono has spewed into the atmosphere over the years.</p>
<p>Besides, the band promised to buy carbon offsets. They even hired a company to help. And that's almost as responsible as personally planting the 20,118 trees environmental activist Helen Roberts claimed were necessary to neutralize the tour.</p>
<p>The logic behind the scale and timing of such a production can be argued until Bono wears his patented shades to the grave: After all, U2 certainly doesn't require it to fill seats.</p>
<p>But no one in the 60,000-strong crowd was debating the entertainment value added by it Wednesday night at BC Place.</p>
<p>7 p.m. Forget swine flu, because more than a few dudes filing into BC Place early to catch the Black Eyed Peas have Bono fever. Symptoms include wearing tight T-shirts and sunglasses at night. Regardless, the stage -- which resembles a giant alien ship -- is ridiculously massive, the pointed top almost touching BC Place's fabric roof. The stadium's not even half full yet and the Black Eyed Peas have just taken the stage, with will.i.am greeting the crowd with a drawn out "Vancooooooouver..."</p>
<p>7:30 p.m. There's an army of dancers onstage dressed as robot/speaker hybrids and the whole thing is quite silly. The Black Eyed Peas don't sound too bad, but the cavern that is BC Place just isn't a hospitable environment for musicians. They are making the most of it, however, and will.i.am is playing a keytar. A keytar! That's what I would play, if I was a musician. And the cowbell.</p>
<p>7:45 p.m. Inherent acoustic challenges aside, Fergie sounds pretty good as she works her way through Big Girls Don't Cry. She's wearing some serious spikes on her feet and her disco-ball top is shimmering as she prances about the stage. The crowd is on its feet for the familiar guitar riff behind Pump It. So far, none of the Peas are utilizing the 360-degree ramp that wraps around the in-the-round setup. Perhaps it's reserved for Bono.</p>
<p>8 p.m. Air-raid sirens signal the driving bass behind Boom Boom Pow. Then will.i.am addresses the crowd with his auto-tune engaged: "I'm gonna miss this big-ass stage," he says. "I'm gonna miss these big-ass crowds." Then they blow the roof off the joint with their fitting, final song of the night, I Gotta Feeling, that really can't be described as anything less than a brilliant pop song. The seats are literally bouncing as the crowd -- now filling most of the seats and the expansive floor -- rocks out to the chorus.</p>
<p>8:45 p.m. After the longest changeovers in concert history, U2 is minutes away from taking the stage and the excited crowd is doing the wave. I keep expecting to look down and see Crazy George running around on the floor. Hey, whatever happened to that guy? There's a veritable sea of people crammed onto the floor -- which reminds me, I need to bust out the hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>9 p.m. Not surprisingly, the Irish rockers kick off the show with a trio of tracks from their latest release, No Line On the Horizon: Breathe, the decidedly un-U2-like Get On Your Boots and Magnificent. Bono, clad in traditional all-black and patented sunglasses, is basking in stadium love and has already covered more square footage than any of the Peas. Why? Because he's Bono. Bono, by the way, is a tiny dude, and it's not just because I'm looking at him from another time zone. In fact, I think the Bono-to-stage-size ratio makes for a sublime metaphor for his off-stage body-to-ego ratio.</p>
<p>9:15 p.m. Bono's utilizing the circular ramp! As is the Edge. As a matter of fact, they're singing Mysterious Ways at each other from inches away. It's a bit homo-erotic, actually. Not that there's anything wrong with that. Side-note: Larry Mullen has the most serene expression on his face when he drums. It's like he's knitting. If knitting was kick-ass.</p>
<p>9:30 p.m. Bono and band have the crowd hopping to Beautiful Day, and the boys are showing why they are widely considered to be the best band in the world. The crowd is singing along to I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For and, while they probably aren't going to find it in BC Place on this night, they certainly got what they came for: a superb stadium show executed expertly by bona fide rock veterans.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A decade of abundance and deep anxiety; Who says the 21st century has been any different for the people living it than the one before?</b>
</div><div>Dominic Sandbrook   </div>
<div>Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>1505 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Since they say that time speeds up as you get older, perhaps it is not surprising that the end of the decade has crept up on us so stealthily. By the end of this year, we will have another 10-year slice of history to file alongside the hungry 1930s, the stuffy 1950s and the swinging 1960s.</p>
<p>No matter that history rarely falls neatly into 10-year units to match the calendar. Already the slicing and dicing of the recent past has begun.</p>
<p>In a modern popular culture obsessed with the short term, what Ferdinand Mount once called "decaditis" is now so virulent that even somebody totally ignorant of recent history will know immediately what you mean by the 1930s (dole queues, fascists, appeasement) or the 1960s (sex, drugs and rock'n'roll).</p>
<p>Never mind that the decade label often obscures more than it reveals. Never mind that even during the Great Depression, long-term trends were turning the English-speaking world into a more affluent society, or that even in the 1960s the great majority of people never dropped out, never tried drugs and cared little about the Beatles.</p>
<p>The truth is that the decade has become unavoidable. From Fifties' morality to Eighties' fashion, it is not only a potent marketing wheeze, it has, almost unnoticed, become the inevitable tool for making sense of the recent past.</p>
<p>So what will historians make of the first decade of the 21st century? It has to be said that it turned out very differently from what we all expected. To open a newspaper from 10 years ago is to be catapulted back into a world that now seems weirdly distant, its anxieties foolish and its expectations misguided. The headlines in 1999 were dominated by the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the NATO campaign against Slobodan Milosevic and the looming menace of the Millennium Bug.</p>
<p>After just two years in office, Tony Blair had the future at his feet, while the Conservatives seemed to be staggering towards oblivion under the leadership of William Hague. Peter Mandelson was looking forward to the opening of the Millennium Dome, while football fans salivated at the thought of England's new dawn under Kevin Keegan. Only a tiny minority had heard of Osama bin Laden and almost nobody had heard of Jade Goody.</p>
<p>In some ways, the 2000s have been oddly similar to the 1900s. Most histories of the early years of the last century start not in 1900 but with the death of Queen Victoria in 1901, and it is a reasonable assumption that many histories of the 2000s will kick off on Sept. 11, 2001, the day when everything is supposed to have changed.</p>
<p>It is clear now that the world did not change utterly that day: The underlying trends of globalization, technological development and environmental degradation continued unchecked. But that, too, is a parallel with the past. A hundred years ago, our Edwardian predecessors were obsessed less by the danger of a world war than by the threat of political terrorism. And while the anarchist bomber cast a long shadow, other issues monopolized public attention in a way that now seems almost ludicrous. To the Edwardians, the great questions of the day were Home Rule for Ireland, the People's Budget and the composition of the House of Lords. But when we look back, all we can see is the looming hulk of the First World War.</p>
<p>For all the oceans of ink spilled about terrorism, multiculturalism and the problem of political Islam, therefore, future historians may well look elsewhere for the issues that defined the last 10 years. In many ways we have been extraordinarily fortunate. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, bloody as they have been, were sideshows compared with the slaughter of the world wars. The economic downturn since 2007, while alarming, still seems much less threatening than the global depression of the 1930s or the seismic shocks of the 1970s.</p>
<p>Most people enjoy comforts and entertainments of which our predecessors could barely have dreamed, from cheap city-breaks to music at the click of a mouse. The digital revolution has made life much easier, more accessible and more fluid.</p>
<p>Yet does technology really define our age? After all, it was in the 1980s that home computers and video games first became familiar features of the landscape, and in the 1990s that people first wasted hours staring at pornography on the Internet, first ordered books from Amazon they would never read, and first made other commuters' lives a misery by shouting "I'm on the train!" into their mobile phones.</p>
<p>Most of the technological developments of the 2000s actually allow us to do things we could do already, only in a faster or different way. Television on the Internet, for example, is hardly as exciting or groundbreaking as the innovation of television in the first place.</p>
<p>But our obsession with technology is revealing in other ways, too. Like so many developments of the 2000s, it is the story of apparent abundance underpinned by deep anxiety. For every newspaper feature enthusing about the latest Apple gadget, there is one about the seduction of Internet pornography, the threat of online pedophile rings or the dangers of cellphones.</p>
<p>And in other areas, too, self-congratulation and self-flagellation are bound together. We live longer than ever before, yet we tormented ourselves with fears of pestilence and plague, most of which turned out to be unfounded. The Millennium Bug never struck, SARS and bird flu came and went, and swine flu seems to be heading the same way.</p>
<p>Even the rash of terrorist atrocities forecast after Sept. 11 never really materialized; there has not been an attack on American soil since 2001, and the appalling Madrid and London bombings were, thankfully, isolated abominations. Yet still we gnaw our fingernails with unease.</p>
<p>In an age of relative political consensus, when old class divisions were mostly forgotten and the violent passions of the past seemed a distant memory, we worried about the rise of apathy. We revel in levels of affluence that would have left our forefathers slack-jawed with envy, yet at the same time we fret that we are addicted to debt and obsessed by consumerism.</p>
<p>Our predecessors worried they had too little; we worried we had too much.</p>
<p>One of the clichés of modernity is to tell ourselves that we live in an age of unprecedented change and that we are unusually obsessed with the new. In fact, people have been telling themselves both these things every year since the 1960s. And to my mind the most compelling stories of the 2000s were old ones.</p>
<p>One was perhaps the oldest theme in human history: decline and fall on the one hand, rise to power on the other. Predicting what future historians will write may be a mug's game, but it is a good bet that they will look back at the 2000s as the moment when American power -- often arrogant, overextended and based on unsustainable levels of debt -- began to yield before the re-emergence of China and India.</p>
<p>For most of human history, the great civilizations of south and east Asia have set the pace: As late as 1500, few would have predicted they would be overtaken by Western Europe. In the past 10 years, however, they have manifestly begun to catch up; by some measures the Chinese are already ahead. It is already a cliché that the 20th century was the American century, but the 21st belongs to Asia. But it is only a cliché because it is almost certainly true.</p>
<p>The other story was the tsunami of Boxing Day 2004, one of the deadliest natural disasters in history. An estimated 200,000 people died that day, almost a hundred times as many as were killed on Sept. 11, 2001.</p>
<p>Like the Lisbon earthquake of 1755, which shattered the self-satisfaction of the Enlightenment, it was a humbling and terrifying reminder of our own vulnerability.</p>
<p>It reminded us that for all our gadgets and our self-admiration, we are just another generation scrabbling to stay alive in an unpredictable environment -- one we have often treated with cavalier disregard, and are only gradually learning to preserve. And for my money it is that story -- not the war on terror nor even the terrifying rise of Simon Cowell -- that may come to define our times.</p>

supposedly changed utterly after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, but
did it really? We're just one more generation scrabbling to stay

<div id="hd"><b>Airports 'major gateways' for infectious diseases; Report recommends more flu screening, but some say it's already too late</b>
</div><div>Bradley Bouzane   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>475 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>In the face of an H1N1 pandemic, Canadian airports are serving as "major gateways for infectious diseases," according to a report that suggests more flu screening is required at airports to crack down on the spread, but some fear it's too late to take action in airports.</p>
<p>The report, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, singles out Toronto as the "most vulnerable point of entry in Canada," followed by Vancouver International Airport.</p>
<p>It suggests airports consider the use of thermal sensors that can detect the body heat of passengers, increased passenger screening and other testing methods, to reduce the spread of infection.</p>
<p>Christopher McDougall of the University of Toronto's Joint Centre for Bioethics, which deals with ethical issues of a pandemic response, says protective measures along those lines would not be of much help and believes the time has passed to be largely effective in airports.</p>
<p>"With H1N1, the cat's out of the bag," McDougall said Wednesday. "[We can] do virtually nothing -- it would be a waste of resources at this point. It's very rare that screening for any kind of flu would be effective at airports.</p>
<p>"By the time people are travelling, your early cases will be asymptomatic, but still spreading. It's basically a non-issue for influenza."</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">Greater Toronto Airports Authority</span>, which includes Pearson Airport, would not comment specifically on any measures taken to deal with H1N1 and referred all questions to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>Heather-Jo McCarley, the Vancouver Airport Authority's manager of emergency planning, said the Public Health Agency of Canada institutes any changes in screening over such cases, but has not called for changes at this point.</p>
<p>"We will take our lead from PHAC and follow any directives they deem necessary," she said.</p>
<p>The CMAJ report -- titled An Analysis of Canada's Vulnerability to Emerging Infectious Disease Threats via the Global Airline Transportation Network -- says Canada needs to establish closer ties to disease-control officials in other countries, with an emphasis on countries with higher air traffic volumes and weaker health systems.</p>
<p>Creating a link to the last major infectious disease outbreak in Canada, co-author Dr. Kamran Khan said air travel became a central focus for preventing the spread when SARS first surfaced in 2002 and continued through 2003.</p>
<p>"The overwhelming number of SARS cases that moved from country to country were by air travel," Khan said in the CMAJ. "Now we're seeing the same with novel H1N1."</p>
<p>Khan and co-author Dr. Michael Gardam, both from Toronto's St. Michael's Hospital, said the study was commissioned after the air-travel industry became a focal point during the SARS outbreak.</p>

</div><div>Bloomberg News</div>

</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span> said third-quarter profit rose 30 per cent after currency gains and orders for the Relenza flu drug boosted revenue. Vaccine sales declined because of a "phasing" of shipments, including swine flu shots.</p>
<p>Net income increased to 1.34 billion pounds ($2.18 billion U.S.) from 1.03 billion pounds a year earlier, London-based Glaxo said in a statement yesterday. Earnings excluding some items rose to 28.5 pounds a share from 25.2 pounds, beating the 28.1-pound mean estimate from 18 analysts surveyed by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>The pound weakened against the U.S. dollar, increasing the value of Glaxo's U.S. sales. Revenue advanced 15 per cent to 6.76 billion pounds, beating the 6.75-billion-pound mean estimate of 19 analysts. Sales of Relenza more than doubled to 182 million pounds as governments expanded their stockpiles of flu-fighting treatments amid a pandemic that has killed more than 5,000 worldwide since April.</p>
<p>"After 11 straight quarters of declining sales growth, it's good to see sales growth is positive," <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Scotland</span> analyst Michael Leacock said in an interview. "I'm a bit cautious though because of the one-off nature of swine flu products, and I recognize 2010 will be challenging because of the loss of Valtrex," an anti-viral medicine that faces generic threats as soon as the fourth quarter, he said.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer Andrew Witty has called 2009 a "year of two halves," saying the worst of Glaxo's patent expiries are over and sales of swine flu treatments will shore up second-half revenue.</p>
<p>The $2.9-billion (U.S.) purchase of Stiefel in July contributed more than 100 million pounds to sales.</p>
