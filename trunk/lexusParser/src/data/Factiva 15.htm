<div id="hd"><b>Worst Of Flu Pandemic Behind Us, Experts Say; Shot Still Urged</b>

</p>
<p>At times in recent weeks, the number of suspected flu patients showing up at the B.C. Children's Hospital's emergency department soared to 50 or 60 a day above usual, prompting it to set up a separate influenza clinic.</p>
<p>In the last several days, however, the arrivals have fallen off so much that the special area was officially closed down on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We're not getting the same wave of patients," said Dr. Ralph Rothstein, a pediatrician at the Vancouver hospital. "I think we're all taking a breather this week."</p>
<p>They are not alone. After a month of intermittent apathy, panic, mixed messages and controversy -- and hard work by many doctors and nurses -- it seems the worst of the H1N1 flu pandemic is over in Canada.</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts generally agree that data from the last couple of weeks shows the epidemic in most of the country has peaked and is on its long downward slide.</p>
<p>"There are several indicators that suggest we are over the top of the slope," said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious-disease prevention with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. "Trends are looking positive in a number of provinces."</p>
<p>The new virus's spread is beginning to wane just as the healthy public gets access to the pandemic-flu vaccine, and with evidence largely confirming that the novel bug is a relatively mild flu, though with some disturbing qualities.</p>
<p>At least one public-health official has accused Canadian governments of going overboard in their response to the pandemic, which is estimated to have cost more than $1-billion.</p>
<p>Other experts defend the resources thrown at the situation, however, noting that it was unclear how virulent H1N1 would be when it emerged in April, and that the disease has provided a sort of dry run for seeing how well pandemic strategies worked.</p>
<p>"It has given us a real, live opportunity to test all of the things we've done in planning and all the measures we've put in place," said Dr. Gerald Evans, president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada. "Even though we've had some tragic deaths ... it's way less than we would have had in that worst-case scenario."</p>
<p>As well, specialists say, the unprecedented wealth of scientific knowledge accumulated in the last few months will lead to years of study, and a new understanding of both pandemics and influenza itself.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of cases remains well above the peak of a regular flu season, and will stay high for weeks, before becoming more sporadic for the rest of the winter. A third, spring wave is still possible, some experts say. With only about a third of Canadians protected against the virus -- either because they were exposed to it or vaccinated -- infectious-disease doctors still strongly recommend getting an H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>Reports of relatively large numbers of deaths are also likely to keep coming -- even as the number of cases shrinks -- since deaths can happen weeks after someone is infected. There were 84 in the past week, more than in all of the virus's initial wave this spring.</p>
<p>A number of measures, however, suggest that the first influenza pandemic in more than 40 years has passed its apex here.</p>
<p>A Public Health Agency of Canada report released late yesterday showed that in the week ending Nov. 14, the number of regions reporting flu activity, the number of outbreaks in schools and hospitals, the number of flu-related doctor visits and the number of influenza</p>
<p>cases sent for testing were all down.</p>
<p>In B.C., where the pandemic's second wave seemed to start and peak first, even the number of flu-linked hospital admissions and deaths has followed the trend.</p>
<p>"We probably passed the peak last week," said Dr. Evans. "We're on the downslope of the other side."</p>
<p>Mathematical modelling that predicted H1N1's second wave would last six to eight weeks appears "dead on," he said.</p>
<p>Declaring that the pandemic has peaked is not easy for physicians and public health officials, though, in the wake of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) crisis six years ago, said Dr. Gardam. With Toronto being pummelled economically, experts and government authorities were under "tremendous pressure" at the time to announce the demise of that outbreak, he said. But no sooner had they predicted the end was nigh than another deadly wave of the virus unexpectedly erupted inside a city hospital.</p>
<p>There is wide agreement that H1N1, a novel virus for which few people had any immunity, has infected far more Canadians than does the seasonal flu. It has proven relatively</p>
<p>benign, however, causing 250 deaths so far, while the vast majority of patients have suffered relatively mild illness. That compares to estimates of as many as 4,000 deaths from seasonal flu in this country.</p>
<p>Dr. Gardam cautions about reading too much into that comparison, though. The seasonal flu mortality estimate is based on mathematical modelling and may well be a "gross over-estimation." Also, those victims are generally very old and very ill, while the death toll from H1N1 has included some fairly young and healthy people, a "traumatic" fact for the ICU staff who cared for them.</p>
<p>A positive side-benefit of the pandemic has been the treasure-trove of scientific data collected with technology -- such as precise Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing that pinpoints the genetics of flus -- that did not exist during the last two pandemics in 1957 and 1968.</p>
<p>"This pandemic has advanced our understanding of flu epidemiology a thousandfold," said Dr. Gardam. "People will be going through this for years to come."</p>
<p>Among the questions that could be answered is how, exactly, influenza is transmitted from person to person -- by simple contact, inhalation of airborne particles or otherwise, he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Evans said he would like to see light shed on the origins of such viruses as diseases that can transmit freely among humans, knowledge that he said might some day allow scientists to stop a pandemic "in its tracks."</p>

<p>Even mild asthma increases a child's risk of being hospitalized with more severe H1N1 flu, researchers in Toronto are warning.</p>
<p>Doctors at the Hospital for Sick Children reviewed the charts of 58 children it admitted with H1N1 between May 8 and July 22.Those children were compared with 200 others hospitalized with seasonal flu during the previous five flu seasons.</p>
<p>The children admitted with H1N1 were significantly more likely to have asthma than those hospitalized with seasonal influenza(22 per cent versus six per cent).</p>
<p>Overall, 46--or 79 per cent--of the children hospitalized with H1N1 had an underlying medical condition, such as asthma, chronic lung disease or heart disease. But the other 12 were previously healthy; five of them were under age two.</p>
<p>None of the children with H1N1 died, compared with one death among those hospitalized with regular flu.</p>
<p>The study comes as Alberta health officials say the second wave of H1N1 appears to be dropping off, with the pressure on intensive-care beds easing and fewer cases in the community.</p>
<p>But Alberta Health Services officials are still urging Albertans to get vaccinated to help ward off a third wave of the influenza.</p>
<p>"As was the case between Wave 1 and 2, we don't expect the virus to disappear completely," said Dr. Andrew Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"There will be transmission ongoing throughout the winter. We also expect to see a third wave at some point during the winter, the size of which . . . will really be influenced by how many people we can get immunized between now and Christmas time."</p>
<p>On Thursday, health officials confirmed two more people with the flu strain have died in Alberta, bringing the total number of deaths to 45.</p>
<p>An elderly man from the Calgary region and an adult woman from the Edmonton area died, said Dr. Gerry Predy, Alberta Health Services'senior medical officer of health. Each had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Next week, the province plans to open its vaccination program to all Albertans. A similar approach when the program was first launched three weeks ago was scrapped, with health officials facing criticism about long lineups. The program was later relaunched with clinics targeted at various high-risk groups.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Corriveau said the vaccine supply issue has been resolved, noting Alberta expects to have 500,000 doses next week.</p>
<p>"We will then make more concrete plans to distribute the vaccine to physicians, pharmacists who want to immunize and start talking with employers that might also be interested to offer clinics in their own settings," Corriveau said.</p>
<p>Albertan's don't need to rush out to get the swine flu shot right away, but should schedule it in over the next few weeks, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Predy said a "line management strategy" is in place to help ward off some of the long wait times experienced earlier. People in long lines will be given wristbands and allowed to leave, with a specific time to return, when they will be first up for the shot, he said.</p>
<p>Predy said provincial officials are monitoring the effects of the second wave of H1N1, but noted the number of serious cases appears to be waning and that influenza patients now occupy about 25 per cent of intensive-care beds compared with a high of about 33 per cent.</p>
<p>The holidays are a prime virus transmission time, so people should be extra vigilant, Predy added.</p>
<p>"We remind people they should be getting their vaccine but, again, no need to rush out to get it."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Toronto researchers who published Thursday's study are urging children with mild asthma to get the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>The study was small, but "because the risk of severe disease appears to have no clear relation to the severity of asthma, even children with mild asthma should receive vaccination and be considered for pre-emptive antiviral therapy," the team reports in a study.</p>

<p>B.C.'s provincial health officer said the Vancouver Canucks definitely jumped the queue when the players and the team's support staff were given the H1N1 vaccine this week.</p>
<p>"They were out of sequence," Dr. Perry Kendall said.</p>
<p>But Canuck general manager Mike Gillis said the team did not act until after federal health officials announced that doses of the H1N1 vaccine were approved for general use and no longer limited to specific groups.</p>
<p>Most of the Canuck players, coaching staff and some support staff members received the vaccine on Sunday and Monday of this week. Kendall said they should not have because they don't meet the existing criteria.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Senior citizens in particular are taking a jab at double flu protection since Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health began offering vaccines against both pandemic H1N1 and seasonal flu this week.</p>
<p>Communications manager Jan Craig said senior citizens are already in the habit of getting seasonal flu inoculations each fall, so it hasn't been a big leap for them to get the shots against H1N1 at the same time.</p>
<p>"Seniors tend to want both," Craig said Thursday. "We've had very good response."</p>
<p>With adequate supplies of both pandemic H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccines available, is it time for everyone to get both?</p>
<p>Craig said it's a matter of choice and her health board hasn't issued a recommendation to date.</p>
<p>"We're offering it. Put it that way," Craig said, sounding like she's leaning toward the double shot.</p>
<p>"Overall, we feel it's efficient and a good option for us and clients, too." (The protocol for two is to give one injection in each arm, with no waiting time needed in between.)</p>
<p>But she added the 14 school-based clinics next week for secondary schoolchildren will not offer seasonal flu vaccination so the public health board can concentrate exclusively on getting youths inoculated as quickly as possible against the H1N1 threat that's given health officials the biggest concern here and abroad.</p>
<p>The health board received 22,000 vaccine doses Tuesday, enough for all who wish protection against the contagious pathogen.</p>
<p>In addition to clinics for the general public, the board is also continuing this week with shots for elementary schoolchildren and staff at area clinics. Further, daily hours have been extended so parents can bring in their children to public clinics like College Avenue Public School in Guelph.</p>
<p>"We've had a very good turnout with families."</p>
<p>Efforts expand next week to include secondary students and staff against the H1N1 circulating in the region and beyond.</p>
<p>That amounts to about 1,000 people Tuesday and an equal amount Wednesday getting the H1N1 shot alone at the College Avenue site, up from about 700 on Monday.</p>
<p>"That's a significant increase."</p>
<p>By the end of Wednesday throughout the health board's coverage area, the board had given 18,732 inoculations against H1N1, Craig added.</p>
<p>People generally wait in line about an hour on average to get their shots, Craig said.</p>
<p>Complications from vaccines have been minor.</p>
<p>"There've been no significant problems I've been aware of," Craig said.</p>

</div><div>Joanne Shuttleworth   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Convincing business owners to stock their cafeterias with healthy snacks, and to offer stress-reducing neck rubs for employees might be a hard sell in tough economic times.</p>
<p>But Bill Koornstra, a senior partner with RLB chartered accountants, said the benefits of providing a workplace wellness program for employees far outweigh the costs.</p>
<p>"There is a cost," he acknowledged in a recent interview. "But there's a huge cost if your staff is unwell or unhappy.</p>
<p>"We want to attract the best and the brightest, and we also want to retain them. We look at our wellness program as an investment, and in those terms, it's definitely paying off."</p>
<p>Tax time is busy season at RLB and Koornstra said it's not unusual for staff to put in 10- or 12-hour days in March and April.</p>
<p>The company often orders in meals and also stocks snacks and beverages for staff and clients.</p>
<p>The first step RLB took in its employee wellness initiative was to alter the menu.</p>
<p>"We offered granola bars instead of chocolate bars, healthier chips, fruit and yogurt," said Cindy Robertson, an account manager at RLB and member of the company's wellness committee.</p>
<p>"Emotionally, they were still getting their comfort food, but there were healthier options," Robertson said.</p>
<p>Any time a new food was added to the selection, it came with take-away information cards that included nutrition information and recipes.</p>
<p>The company sought out caterers and restaurants that could deliver healthy meals instead of fat-laden pizza or carb-heavy sandwiches.</p>
<p>Once staff became accustomed to healthier fare, the company took the next step, which was to encourage staff to take a first step.</p>
<p>It gave pedometers to those who wanted them.</p>
<p>"We climbed (the equivalent of) Mount Everest the first year," Robertson said.</p>
<p>"It became a competition and people started talking about their success. We started it during busy season, too, and the drop in stress levels was very clear."</p>
<p>The free pedometers led to noon-hour walking groups.</p>
<p>Koornstra said the first year 10 to 15 pedometers were given away. The second year 50 staffers wanted one.</p>
<p>The company provides 20-minute neck and shoulder massages for staff during busy season. It gave staff environmentally friendly water bottles. It also arranges cooking classes.</p>
<p>They try to keep it fun - there are a lot of inter-department competitions, like their in-house Biggest Loser contest. But even there, it's healthy competition.</p>
<p>This year they are branching into mental wellness initiatives, Robertson said.</p>
<p>"We started with yoga and looking at breathing and ways to improve concentration. In our newsletter we included information about seasonal affective disorder and we're bringing in a speaker in December to talk about the stigma attached to mental illness," she said.</p>
<p>"Mental wellness must be part of a complete wellness package but you have to be brave enough to tackle it. We will keep pushing the agenda forward."</p>
<p>"The senior team has to join in," Koornstra said. "You have to walk the walk or you lose credibility."</p>
<p>"My clients are looking at this," said Lynne Bard, owner of Beyond Rewards, a consulting firm in Guelph that puts together benefit and wellness packages for businesses.</p>
<p>"Maybe the company can't afford gym memberships for staff, but there are inexpensive ways to introduce wellness to the workplace.</p>
<p>"And let's face it, in many cases we spend more time at work with our colleagues than at home with our families. These things really make a difference."</p>
<p>This year, with the threat of H1N1, Bard said more businesses are considering flex time and working from home as viable options for staff if someone in the home gets sick.</p>
<p>"It can be as simple as a fruit bowl or as complex as rewriting company policy," Bard said.</p>
<p>"But workplace wellness is a growing area. Employers are beginning to realize that having these things in place makes a big difference.</p>
<p>"Productivity goes up, absenteeism goes down and that's the bottom line."</p>

</p>
<p>Q: A:</p>
<p>Q: I've been married for five years and was recently diagnosed with a sleep disorder called sexsomnia. My husband has concluded that there's no problem and that I'm having affairs.</p>
<p>Recently, I received a phone call from a lady saying she and my husband are having an affair. My husband said he was sorry and would end it and give our marriage a chance. The lady then lied that she was pregnant to keep him around, then lied that she had a miscarriage. They keep seeing each other.</p>
<p>I've asked our pastor to talk to my husband, and he's reduced the frequency of being with her. Is it a sign of change, or is it just me who wants something I can't have? I told him to move out but it seems he's not ready to move in with this lady yet.</p>
<p>A: Let's start with that fairly rare diagnosis, which may be a clue to this messed-up marriage: Sexsomnia. The common definition is sexual behaviour driven by abnormal arousal during deep sleep. Some definitions also describe the sex act as violent, with the initiator later unaware, when awake, of what happened.</p>
<p>So, if you're only ever in bed with Hubby, then he's the guy you're jumping when asleep . . . which makes it odd that he'd accuse you of having affairs.</p>
<p>There's no question that he has been cheating. The pastor may be able to influence him, but you two need additional help to stay together. Get back to your doctor and have him recommend a sex therapist for you to attend together. Ask for ways to deal with your condition and with Hubby's wandering, through a renewed approach to intimacy between you. If needed, also see a marriage counsellor to look at other areas of how you two relate.</p>
<p>Q: My close girlfriend is a university student like me; she never does her work on time, leaving everything until the last minute. So it builds up into almost unresolvable matters.</p>
<p>She's resorted to obtaining doctors' notes as excuses, by feigning symptoms in walk-in clinics. She's faked having the swine flu in order to avoid writing a midterm for which she was unprepared.</p>
<p>When work builds up, she gets very irritable and complains about how much she has to do. I tell her to plan it, but she does nothing. Sometimes, she drops classes for good. I tell her to use the summer to try different internships and jobs, but she does nothing. Maybe she has a mental health condition preventing her from trying at school, e.g. depression. She doesn't seem depressed, interacts with friends regularly and doesn't have other symptoms of withdrawal and hopelessness. Or maybe it's "chronic laziness." I don't know which is closest to the truth. I don't know what to do.</p>
<p>A: Whoa! Stop the amateur analysis, step back and consider what is not your business or responsibility to fix.</p>
<p>Your girlfriend's already shown that she'll not change her ways just from your suggestions. She needs to find out for herself - even if it means failing - how to get motivated or decide what else to do.</p>
<p>While your concern comes from caring, your attempt at labelling her "condition" isn't useful, save for assuring that she's not depressed. Now back off. She needs personal growth without relying on you as her crutch.</p>

</div><div>Mike Beamish   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>544 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>C5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>GAME TIME</p>
<p>EAST DIVISION FINAL</p>
<p>LIONS at ALOUETTES 11 a.m. Sunday Media: TSN</p>
<p>Solid as a fire plug but no bigger than one, Ian Smart was shunned by Division 1 college schools in the United States.</p>
<p>The rebuff forced the little Jamaican-born burner to drop down a notch and play at Division II C.W. Post, where he simply became the toast of Long Island.</p>
<p>Scoring an NCAA-record 95 rushing touchdowns as a running back, Smart induced so much fear as a kick returner that opposing college teams deliberately kicked the ball out of bounds to keep it from him.</p>
<p>Like many players who end up in the CFL, his pro career has been a trail of rejection slips, first from the New York Jets, then the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and eventually from the Montreal Alouettes, who released him in favour of Avon Cobourne.</p>
<p>He caught on with the B.C. Lions in 2006, and proved to be a major upgrade to the team's return game by winning the CFL's special-teams player award in 2007.</p>
<p>But Smart has never had the luxury of feeling too comfortable. Any time he might entertain the thought, the football gods seem to beat him down a little more.</p>
<p>"I feel like a caged animal who's just been sprung," he said this week as he prepares to face his former team in the East Division final on Sunday at Olympic Stadium.</p>
<p>The resilience of Smart's pride has indeed been tested this year. Expected to be the feature back and primary returner in training camp, Smart wanted badly to do both. But he suffered a pulled groin in the July 3 opener against the Saskatchewan Roughriders, watched as running back Martell Mallett established himself as a leading candidate for rookie of the year, then was reduced to a spare part when coach Wally Buono went instead with Ryan Grice-Mullen and newcomer Michael Bumpus as his return men.</p>
<p>"As a man, you've got to push your pride aside," Smart says. "I've gone through a lot of adversity this year, as far as being injured, and not being productive in the first half of the season. When you've got a guy like Grice-Mullen back there, it's hard to sit him down for a guy who's not productive. I understood what was going on. That doesn't mean it's easy to take."</p>
<p>When Bumpus contracted the H1N1 virus, and Buono grew disenchanted with backup tailback A.J. Harris, the coach decided to play a hunch two weeks ago and reactivate Smart, who had been cooling his heels for more than a month.</p>
<p>He responded with a momentum-shifting 61-yard kickoff return last Sunday against the Hamilton Tiger-Cats, three rushes for 21 yards and a single catch for eight yards. But it was a huge reception, the winning touchdown in overtime as the Lions won the East semifinal 34-27.</p>

<p>Moldovan soldiers have been issued with an extra ration of onions and garlic to ward off swine flu, the Defence Ministry's chief doctor said Thursday.</p>
<p>"We have introduced an extra 25 grams (one ounce) of onion and 15 grams of garlic in their daily ration," Sergiu Vasilita said.</p>
<p>So far, 24 soldiers have completed treatment for swine flu, while 19 are in hospital with acute respiratory infections, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Canada's H1N1 flu vaccine manufacturer has asked the provinces to temporarily discontinue vaccinating Canadians from a lot of vaccine shipped in October due to a higher risk of adverse reactions, says a Manitoba health official.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief public health officer, said Thursday that <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has asked that the October batch be taken out of circulation because it produced serious and immediate anaphylactic reactions in one out of 20,000 vaccinations, compared with one out of 100,000 in other shipments.</p>
<p>"We've been asked by the manufacturer GSK to not use this vaccine at this time pending further investigation," he said.</p>
<p>However, most of the vaccine Manitoba received from the suspect lot had already been used by the time the province received the alert on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Of the 63,000 doses shipped, only 630 remained unused by the four regional health authorities in Manitoba that received them.</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear Thursday evening how much of that lot of vaccine had been used in other provinces.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu assessment clinics to be closed; Inuit community facility only one to remain open</b>
</div><div>Neco Cockburn, Pauline Tam and Dave Rogers   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>940 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The City of Ottawa is shutting down all but one of its flu assessment centres by the end of today because of declining pressure on the city's hospital emergency rooms.</p>
<p>"Their patient load has dropped over the last week, they're relatively quiet," Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, said Thursday. "The hospital emergency room load has decreased back to something close to usual levels."</p>
<p>One clinic, the Tungasuvvingat Inuit Community Centre, will remain open, Levy said during an update to city council's community and protective services committee.</p>
<p>The city's Inuit community is made up of migrants and is "somewhat isolated," and its centre remains busy, Levy said.</p>
<p>Centres throughout the city have seen almost 3,000 patients since opening in early November.</p>
<p>Similar assessment centres in Smiths Falls, North Lanark and Kemptville have also closed, suggesting the rates of swine flu may have peaked in Eastern Ontario.</p>
<p>Levy told the committee that indications of the H1N1 flu's activity had dropped. Fewer schools are reporting 10-per-cent absenteeism, and there has been a decline this week in respiratory outbreaks in institutions, he said.</p>
<p>As well, fewer people have been visiting hospital emergency rooms. CHEO and the Queensway Carleton Hospital have said they are "demobilizing what were separate flu emergency operations," Levy said.</p>
<p>The number of new laboratory-confirmed cases in Ottawa has also declined.</p>
<p>Despite the promising signs, the flu season has not ended, Levy said. The current flu strain will remain in the community for months and it's difficult to predict how it will behave, Levy said.</p>
<p>The city has had more than 370 "laboratory confirmed" flu cases since the start of September, but that number is thought to be only a small reflection of the flu's circulation through the community since the only people formally tested for the illness have been those admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>Five people in Ottawa have died from the flu since September, and a couple of other deaths are being examined to determine whether H1N1 played a role, Levy said.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the city's public health department opened its H1N1 vaccination clinics to the general public. Levy said the city had enough vaccine for residents "at least for this week."</p>
<p>Capacity to provide vaccinations, vaccine supply and public interest "remain in play every day, and we will continue to balance them with the goal of delivering as much vaccine as quickly and efficiently as possible to all," he said.</p>
<p>Levy said that demand for and supply of vaccine were "going to be the real questions over the next two weeks."</p>
<p>Demand for the pandemic flu vaccine appeared to be brisk on the first full day the vaccine was made available to the general public.</p>
<p>By midday Thursday, clinics at Constellation Crescent, Barrhaven Crossing Mall, Orléans Client Service Centre and Jim Durrell Complex were no longer accepting clients.</p>
<p>The shortest waits appeared to be at the Tom Brown Arena, where only a handful of people lined up for shot Thursday morning, surprising city staff, who expected a long lineup with the vaccine finally available to anyone who wants it.</p>
<p>Judith Dupuis, one of the city employees managing lineups at the clinic, said about 20 people arrived at the arena before 8 a.m. to get numbered wristbands, which guarantee them a place in line for the vaccine. By 10 a.m., city staff had distributed 350 wristbands of the 1,000 they had expected to hand out.</p>
<p>"I thought we would be swamped," Dupuis said. "On the first day of the vaccination campaign, we had 1,000 people in the morning. Some people lined up at 4 a.m., so we had to deal with a big crowd.</p>
<p>"Now it is manageable and we are able to put the arrivals in a tent and everybody has a seat."</p>
<p>People who want the vaccine are given wrist bracelets, told what time to return and asked to fill out forms.</p>
<p>Emily Maki, a University of Ottawa education student, said she wanted to get the vaccine because she would be doing some supply teaching and was afraid of getting the flu while on assignment.</p>
<p>Maki had expected there would be a long wait at the arena.</p>
<p>"I expected they would be out of wristbands by now because they're usually out by about 9 a.m.," she said. "I got here at 10 a.m., and I expected there would be a long lineup because on the first day, when they opened here, it was just craziness."</p>
<p>Demand may be slackening at the city-run clinics as more family doctors and large workplaces start administering the shots.</p>
<p>For instance, a vaccination clinic will be held at the University of Ottawa from Monday to next Friday. It is reserved for the university's students and employees and will not open to family members.</p>
<p>In the Outaouais, the expected delivery of about 20,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine will allow health officials to expand the vaccination program today to include people who are 65 and over.</p>
<p>Dr. Guy Morissette, director of the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de l'Outaouais, said the people who could be vaccinated would include seniors, people between six months and 19 years old, pregnant women, people with chronic medical conditions and those with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>Agency spokeswoman Céline Jacob said health officials had not decided when they would be able to vaccinate all Outaouais residents.</p>

</p>
<p>There will be zero tolerance for hits to the head during the hockey showdown at the Vancouver Olympic Games.</p>
<p>The International Ice Hockey Federation announced on Thursday that it will crack down on all hits to the head and neck area, enforcing a rule that was adopted in 2002 at the IIHF's congress in Sweden.</p>
<p>"The calling of this rule follows the same principles as the rule on checking from behind," IIHF sport director Dave Fitzpatrick said Thursday on the federation's website. "This means; a two-minute minor plus a 10-minute misconduct, a five-minute major plus an automatic game misconduct or a match penalty.</p>
<p>"The IIHF has a supplementary discipline rule where all such calls can be reviewed and additional suspension added if deemed necessary." While the National Hockey League continues to debate the issue of hits to the head, the IIHF introduced its rule a result of research into concussions and their long-term effects.</p>
<p>"This rule is backed by scientific research and study," said Fitzpatrick. "The application of the rule begins to address the insurance costs for medical attention of injured players plus the insurance for contracts between injured players and their club for missed time due to such head injury. We have learned through our research that the recovery from a concussion and the return to play is an individual one and can vary from player to player and increases with each additional concussion sustained."</p>
<p>Canucks jumped H1N1 queue</p>
<p>British Columbia's provincial health officer says Vancouver Canucks players jumped the line when they received swine flu vaccinations this week.</p>
<p>"If they got the vaccine and they weren't in any of the risk groups as individuals then they were queue-jumping," Dr. Perry Kendall said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p>"I don't know why they queue-jumped because they only had to wait a few days."</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine will be made available to all British Columbians on Friday.</p>
<p>Canucks coach Alain Vigneault denied after practice Thursday any wrongdoing by his team.</p>
<p>"It was always our intention that once the vaccine was made available to the public that our players would have the opportunity to take it if they wanted it," he said. "My understanding is it's been made available to the public. That's all I know." Canucks general manager Mike Gillis declined to be interviewed.</p>

</p>
<p>There have been about 40 deaths worldwide among people who have recently been vaccinated against pandemic H1N1 influenza, but there is no evidence the deaths are related to the vaccine, officials from the World Health Organization said Thursday.</p>
<p>At least 65 million people have been vaccinated, and it is inevitable that there will be some deaths among such a large group, said Dr. Marie-Paule Kieny, director for the Initiative for Vaccine Research at the WHO.</p>
<p>Although some investigations are still ongoing, she said at a news conference in Geneva, "results of the completed investigations reported to WHO have ruled out that the pandemic vaccine is the cause of death."</p>
<p>She said fewer than a dozen suspected cases of Guillain-Barre Syndrome have been reported following vaccination and only a few of these may be linked to the pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>Guillain-Barre has been a particular concern because many cases occurred during the 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign, although none were definitively linked to the vaccine. That has led to the belief in some quarters that the vaccine is worse than the illness.</p>
<p>Overall the WHO has received reports of one adverse event for every 10,000 doses of vaccine. Among those, five out of 100 have been for serious events, for an overall rate of five serious events for every million vaccinations. Many were reactions among people with unsuspected allergies to eggs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Region's home-care boss quits post; Departure comes after agency overspends budget by $6.5 million</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1146 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Eighteen months after being hired, the head of Eastern Ontario's home-care agency has stepped down from her $168,000-a-year job, after the organization overspent its budget by $6.5 million and had to scale back services for the frail, sick and dying.</p>
<p>The abrupt departure of Sheila Bauer from the Champlain Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) signals what is likely to be a protracted period of uncertainty for the region's troubled home-care program, as the agency struggles to balance its $180-million budget.</p>
<p>"Sheila's departure is not a good sign," said Hugh Armstrong, a social-work professor at Carleton University and a former CCAC board member. "She's a veteran. She is knowledgeable. It's a loss to the CCAC and to the community."</p>
<p>The leadership vacuum could create problems for the 56,000 Eastern Ontarians -- the dying, the disabled, hospital patients sent home early and seniors trying to remain in their homes -- who, each year, rely on home care as a more humane, less costly alternative to crowded hospitals and nursing homes.</p>
<p>In an attempt to rein in spending, the home-care agency has already stopped taking new clients and cut back in-home services such as nursing visits, personal support, physiotherapy and end-of-life care.</p>
<p>The CCAC's cost-cutting measures have left a growing number of elderly patients languishing in hospital, while dying patients are being denied their wish to spend their final days in their own homes.</p>
<p>The backlog causes hospital-wide gridlock, leading to cancelled surgeries, bed shortages and long emergency-room waits. In recent weeks, overcrowding in hospitals has resulted in some frail elderly patients being parked in beds next to patients suffering from H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>At least 15 physicians and nurses, mostly from The Ottawa Hospital, have signed a petition criticizing the home-care cuts and calling on the province to intervene.</p>
<p>The cuts are being monitored by Eastern Ontario's health-planning agency, which has authority over how provincial health dollars are spent in the region.</p>
<p>"Our board is very concerned about the impact on patients, and I know the CCAC board is as well," said Marie Fortier, chairwoman of the Champlain Local Health Integration Network (LHIN).</p>
<p>In the interest of ensuring that the CCAC balances its budget without sacrificing essential home-care services, Fortier hinted that the LHIN is considering a financial bailout. The proposal is expected to be debated at a LHIN meeting next Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It's impossible to balance the budget completely without touching service, but some of the measures they have taken seem to be causing an awful lot of hardship," said Fortier. "So we'll have to see what else can be done that would reduce some of those impacts."</p>
<p>Bauer's departure was announced on Thursday in a statement issued by Lynn Graham, the CCAC's board chair, and vice-chair Michael Tate. It's unclear whether Bauer resigned or was dismissed. No one from the CCAC responded to requests for comment.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Patrice Connolly, a CCAC vice president, has been appointed interim chief executive and "an announcement regarding a plan to replace the CEO will be forthcoming shortly," said Graham and Tate.</p>
<p>This is the third time in two years the Champlain CCAC has lost its top executive. In 2008, Sandra Golding stepped down as the agency's executive director after only one year on the job. She was replaced briefly by Guy Arseneau.</p>
<p>In May 2008, Bauer assumed the position on a temporary basis and was given a longer-term appointment six months later.</p>
<p>A former hospital nursing manager with a decade-long career in home and community care, Bauer is a respected administrator who occupied several senior management roles at the agency's precursor, the Ottawa CCAC.</p>
<p>But since 2007, when amalgamation in the home-care sector led to the creation of the much larger Champlain CCAC, the agency has lurched from crisis to crisis.</p>
<p>"They had to spend a lot of time and energy and money just figuring out how to do the reorganization rather than how to provide the services to those in need," said Armstrong, the former board member.</p>
<p>In the process, the agency has swung from budget surpluses to deficits.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, the agency found itself scrambling to spend more than $2 million as it approached the end of the fiscal year because it couldn't find enough people to do the work. The CCAC eventually spent its full budget allocation by contracting more home-care agencies to provide the services.</p>
<p>It wasn't the first time the CCAC had accumulated unused funds. In 2008, the agency had $2.5 million left over at the end of the fiscal year. Because the agency is not allowed to carry a budget surplus, it was ordered by the LHIN to redistribute those funds among the region's hospitals.</p>
<p>Observers say the CCAC's problems run deep and are larger than the individual leading the agency. "The person at the top of the organization has to assume responsibility, but it is not her responsibility alone," said Armstrong.</p>
<p>"There's something very deep in terms of how the organization operates that needs to be addressed," said Fortier. "That can't be solved overnight."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Fortier helped lead an operational review of the CCAC, which uncovered widespread problems with the way the agency makes high-level decisions that affect the quality of home care.</p>
<p>In particular, the CCAC often operates with incomplete or out-of-date planning information, leading to "distrust between partners and inefficient use of health-care resources," said a report prepared by the consulting firm KPMG.</p>
<p>As a result, many hospitals are wary about referring patients to the CCAC, while clients, confused by the complex way the home-care program is organized, are often unsure about how to register complaints when there are problems.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the same information gaps have made it difficult for the CCAC to fulfill its other role managing nursing-home admissions.</p>
<p>For example, a lack of updated information about the health status of seniors who are being considered for nursing-home beds has led to people being admitted to "an inappropriate facility or area within a facility," the report said.</p>
<p>The report recommended the CCAC bolster its ability to gather client information and do more to give its 600 case managers greater face-to-face time with the people they're trying to help.</p>

<div>Issues & Ideas</div>
<div id="hd"><b>B.C. government is on the wrong course; A competitive private sector needs a strong public sector to support it</b>
</div><div>Jim Sinclair   </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>804 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Next week, 700 union members from across British Columbia will meet in Vancouver to discuss, debate and likely argue once or twice over the key issues of our day, how best to confront the economic crisis we are in. Our delegates are the women and men who work in all sectors of our economy, in all parts of our province. Like all British Columbians, they have witnessed the economic collapse of the last year and are looking for solutions. They want to know how we can create and protect good jobs that support strong families and strong communities.</p>
<p>Just as important, they want to know how this can be done in a way that we halt and reverse the environmental damage we have done. This is the dual challenge. Answers will not come easy, but a few things are clear. We all need a strong private sector. That is where we create most of our wealth and the majority of our jobs. Of course, we must ensure that our private sector remains competitive while keeping and creating good paying jobs. That means training skilled workers and implementing economic policies that encourage local jobs rather than exporting them.</p>
<p>But, we also know that the private sector and the people of B.C. need a strong public sector in order to succeed. When B.C. became a province more than a century ago, the people and their elected leaders made a collective commitment to build this province. That meant investing in our public sector, building schools, colleges and universities, developing a health care system, transportation infrastructure, transit systems and power generation. And it worked.</p>
<p>B.C. grew, companies thrived, jobs were created and we built prosperous communities. Our provincial government has ignored the lessons of our short history. The Liberals' view of the manufacturing sector is built on the flawed premise that left to their own devices corporations will do what is best for the people of B.C. They believe that businesses will invest here if we eliminate regulations and slash tax obligations. For eight years this philosophy has failed miserably.</p>
<p>For example, we have only to look at shipbuilding and the forest sector to see that instead of creating good private- sector and manufacturing jobs, far too many good jobs have vanished.</p>
<p>Although the Campbell government claimed credit for their supposed "boom" years, there was little economic growth in B.C. other than real estate and consumer spending, and we now have high levels of household debt to show for it.</p>
<p>The other cornerstones of the Liberal dogma are tax cutting and ripping up the rights of public service workers. Since being elected in 2001, the Campbell government has introduced 120 tax cuts. And of course they have cut services and jobs, too. B.C. now has the lowest expenditure per capita on public services in the country. We spend less money and employ fewer people in the public service per capita than any other province</p>
<p>Provincial spending on public services represented about 20 per cent of our gross domestic product in the early 1980s. Today it represents about 15 per cent. This cut in spending has come at a terrible cost, especially to our most vulnerable.</p>
<p>The economic benefits that these enormous spending cuts were supposed to deliver have failed to materialize. The Liberals' idea of labour peace with the people who provide these public services relies on ripping up legal agreements, unconstitutional gag laws and legislating contracts. The most recent example: Imposing a contract on paramedics and dishonestly blaming it on H1N1, while adding to public uncertainty about the pandemic.</p>
<p>Another thing is clear. If we want to maintain existing public services and create the new services that we need, we must move back to a fair and sustainable tax regime. The Campbell government will have handed businesses tax breaks of $3.5 billion every year if the harmonized sales tax is introduced next summer. Those cuts must be reversed. And people at the top of the income tax brackets must return to paying their fair share.</p>
<p>The province is on the wrong course. Putting it back to where we have the public services we need and a renewed private sector based on skilled workers, decent jobs and value-added industries is no easy task.</p>
<p>But rest assured, working people in B.C. are willing and ready to play our part in this challenge.</p>

<p>Re: "1,000 health jobs on the block," Nov. 18.</p>
<p>With Ron Liepert's promises to improve timely access to health care echoing in our ears, we read that 1,000 more health jobs will be left unfilled. Stephen Duckett tells us this is in search of greater efficiency and budget balancing. He offers no account of the services that will be further rationed, or any sympathy for the sick who are already waiting excessively for diagnosis and treatment. We are too familiar with this government's shortcomings in providing timely and accessible health care. Hospitals, trying to cope with H1N1 admissions, are cancelling surgeries and other services. The reforms have left no excess capacity in the system. Why does the government diminish capacity when common sense tells us that flu epidemics occur, that large-scale injuries happen and sickness surges come from time to time? Hospitals that run at 95 per cent occupancy, have many unfilled staff positions and decaying infrastructure cannot cope with workload surges without displacing other sick people, and putting unreasonable strain on front line staff. This is unsafe, unfeeling and unnecessary. Improvement is unlikely when the same authority that decides how much money will be spent also sets the standards to be met, directly operates and manages the service and then measures its own performance.</p>

<p>Re: "Experts kept on sidelines during flu crisis," Don Braid, Opinion, Nov. 18.</p>
<p>I have watched the bungled rollout of H1N1 vaccinations in Alberta with dismay. As a certified project manager, I was appalled at how poorly planned and executed it was. I am sure it will be prime discussion Nov. 23 at the Project Management Institute's annual conference in Calgary. Further, I am dumbfounded by Alberta Health Services opening H1N1 vaccinations for those aged 65 or older before opening them for children as young as six. As the father of an eight-year-old boy who has not yet been vaccinated, I am shocked at the AHS's politically motivated decisions. Surely, anyone in the 65+ category with any decency will abstain from getting their shot before small children get theirs.</p>

<p>I t sounds like her entire body is rattling each time she lets out another deep, raspy cough, and taking the stairs is a struggle, but Jaclyn Bates is on the mend.</p>
<p>Two weeks after being diagnosed with the H1N1 flu virus, and rushed to intensive care with respiratory failure, the mother of two is back at home with her family.</p>
<p>She still needs to master walking and doing simple tasks such as climbing stairs.</p>
<p>"I am 27 years old and I had to learn how to walk all over again," said Bates, whose doctors put her in a medically induced coma for about a week earlier this month while her body fought off swine flu.</p>
<p>"At first (hospital staff) gave me a walker and I was wobbly and felt like I didn't know what to do," she said. "My body just didn't have the energy to move."</p>
<p>Bates says her road to recovery will be long and frustrating, but she's grateful. "It's going to be another month or two until I'm 100 per cent, but I'm alive."</p>
<p>The debilitating symptoms and after-effects of H1N1 are nothing Bates paid much attention to prior to contracting the virus, she said, adding she wondered if media stories and health reports were overblown.</p>
<p>Now, more needs to be done to convince people to get vaccinated and find ways to protect themselves and their families, she said.</p>
<p>"This whole experience has been scarier than I imagined. It's an evil flu. Before I got it I didn't realize how serious it was. I wasn't even going to get the vaccine. Now I think the government should make it mandatory."</p>
<p>As of Thursday, H1N1 has hospitalized more than 1,000 Albertans and the new virus strain is linked to 45 deaths in this province.</p>
<p>Experts say this pandemic flu differs from the seasonal variety in several ways, including its ability to seriously sicken young patients.</p>
<p>Typically, the flu causes serious illness in the very young and the very old. During this pandemic, the median age of Alberta's hospitalized H1N1 cases has been 34 years old.</p>
<p>"Young people say flu doesn't make you that sick," said Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensive care physician with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority. "This is an entirely different flu. The old rules don't apply anymore."</p>
<p>For the most part, H1N1 is causing mild illness. But Kumar said in a small number of cases young people are developing a serious disease.</p>
<p>"(It can cause)a viral pneumonia in both lungs that's very severe and can get incredibly bad if it's not treated early," said Kumar.</p>
<p>In Bates' case, her condition was touch and go for a while.</p>
<p>"I was in a coma for eight days and when I woke up I found out that doctors had told my family I might not make it through the night," said Bates, who has a 10-year-old daughter and a five-month-old son.</p>
<p>Bates and her fiance, Rob Pearce, are planning to get married in Banff next September after three years together.</p>
<p>Their ordeal began with Bates suffering from high fever on Halloween weekend and in a few days she went from the picture of health to breathing from a respirator in the intensive care unit at Rockyview General Hospital.</p>
<p>She had pneumonia and H1N1.Doctors put her in a comatose state so they could control her breathing.</p>
<p>Last Friday, Bates began the slow awakening from her medically induced coma.</p>
<p>On Thursday physicians decided she was strong enough to leave hospital, although she is walking with a cane for support.</p>
<p>She is also wearing a mask to ensure she doesn't infect anyone else with H1N1.</p>

<p>W hy watch a made-for-TV movie about an almost-decade-old U.S. presidential election that was decided far south of the border, down Florida way? Well, to start with, there's the stellar cast: Kevin Spacey, John Hurt, Denis Leary and Laura Dern, among others. To boot, the network in question was HBO, it's directed by Jay Roach (producer of Borat and Bruno) and it won three Emmys (out of a possible 11). Finally, there's the sad-but-true fact that as outlandish as the shenanigans may seem, it's based on what really happened. SATURDAY, HISTORY, CH. 45, 10 P.M.</p>

cooler: that Marshall (Jason Segel) bequeaths a slap bet to Ted and
Robin (Josh Radnor and Cobie Smulders) or that Chris Elliott guests
as the estranged father of slap-bet commissioner Lily (Alyson
Hannigan)? Actually, my vote goes to the series for keeping the
always-lurking running gag going for three years. Monday, City, Ch.
8, and CBS, Ch. 12, 9 p.m.

<p>New curbs on OxyContin sought by Queen's Park</p>
<p>The Ontario government wants to impose new curbs on the highly-addictive painkiller OxyContin before the end of the year.</p>
<p>It is also considering restricting other opiate-based painkillers.</p>
<p>The measures include a computer tracking system that would monitor how much of the drug is going out and send out alerts if a prescription is received two days in a row.</p>
<p>The government is also looking at putting limits on how many pills can be dispensed at a time.</p>
<p>Swine flu shots cleared after 41 people die</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has ruled out swine flu vaccine as a reason for the deaths of 41 people who got the flu shot.</p>
<p>WHO vaccines chief Marie-Paule Kieny says investigations into several more deaths are ongoing.</p>
<p>WHO national authorities examined 41 deaths in six countries.</p>
<p>Kieny said yesterday vaccines against the pandemic H1N1 strain are as safe as vaccines against seasonal flu.</p>
<p>She said only one out of 10,000 vaccinations results in an adverse reaction and of those only one in 20 is serious.</p>
<p>Excess body fat triggers cancer, data suggest</p>
<p>Newly compiled data suggest excess body fat alone is responsible for more than 100,000 cancer cases in the U.S.</p>
<p>The report comes from the American Institute for Cancer Research, which said its data included cases of endometrial, esophageal, pancreatic, kidney, gallbladder, breast and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>No one has pinned down exactly how body fat might increase cancer risk.</p>
<p>New concerns arise over cholesterol drugs</p>
<p>A recent study raises fresh concerns about Zetia and its cousin, Vytorin -- drugs still taken by millions of Americans to lower cholesterol, despite questions raised last year about how well they work.</p>
<p>In the study, Zetia failed to shrink buildups in artery walls while a rival drug, Niaspan, did so significantly. Zetia users also suffered more heart attacks and other problems although the numbers of these events were too small to draw firm conclusions.</p>
<p>Vytorin is a pill that combines Zetia with a statin, simvastatin.</p>
<p>Dr. Roger Blumenthal, at Johns Hopkins University, says Zetia has been on the market for seven years and there's no evidence it improves clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>The research is published in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>

</p>
<p>Children with asthma appear to be at greater risk of becoming severely ill with H1N1 flu than with regular flu.</p>
<p>Parents are being urged to get kids with asthma vaccinated after researchers found more than one in five H1N1 patients admitted to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children from May 8 to July 22 had asthma. They make up an even greater proportion of the most severely ill.</p>
<p>Almost half of children admitted to the intensive care unit with H1N1 during that time had asthma, according to the research released by the Canadian Medical Association Journal yesterday.</p>
<p>"I would say if there was a single message that would emanate from our research, it would be underscoring the importance of preventing H1N1," said Dr. Upton Allen, chief of infectious disease at the hospital and one of the researchers. "Immunization is important."</p>
<p>Today is a good time to get the shot because Hamilton is planning fewer clinics next week than it had this week.</p>
<p>The findings are of particular significance in Hamilton, where asthma rates have consistently been shown to be high.</p>
<p>The researchers found only 6 per cent of kids admitted to the hospital with seasonal flu in the last five years have asthma, compared to 22 per cent for H1N1.</p>
<p>It's unknown how many kids in Hamilton and Halton admitted to hospital with H1N1 had asthma.</p>
<p>What is known is that the majority of those admitted in Hamilton -- about 70 per cent -- have underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>That is consistent with the study, which found 79 per cent of kids hospitalized with H1N1 had other medical conditions.</p>
<p>The researchers warned parents of kids with no health conditions not to let their guard down.</p>
<p>"We still have a small proportion of patients who have no underlying medical conditions that would identify them as being at increased risk, yet those patients are still being admitted," Allen said.</p>
<p>In fact, most kids hospitalized for H1N1 in Halton during the flu's second wave, which started in October, haven't had any other medical conditions. That is in stark contrast to the first wave from April to June, when five of seven kids hospitalized had other conditions.</p>
<p>The study also found H1N1 tends to be more severe in older kids than seasonal flu, with the average age of those hospitalized being 6.4 years compared with 3.3 years for seasonal flu. Halton's age numbers for H1N1 hospitalizations were almost identical.</p>
<p>No children in Hamilton or Halton have died from H1N1. None of the kids from the study died, either.</p>
<p>The researchers gathered the information by reviewing the charts of 58 children admitted with H1N1 between May 8 and July 22 and comparing them to 200 children admitted with seasonal influenza A during the previous five years.</p>
<p>Halton reported its second H1N1 death yesterday. The man, who lived in a nursing home, was in his 80s and had an underlying medical condition. The first death was also a senior with a chronic illness.</p>
<p>Hamilton has had eight deaths since April. All were adults with other health problems and most of them were seniors.</p>
<p>"The highest rates of hospitalizations are in the younger kids, but the higher death rates are in older adults and seniors," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Manitoba sees second death this season - Admissions to ICUs down this past week</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>
<div>1251 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba reported its second H1N1 death of the season on Thursday -- and another large increase in confirmed cases of the virus -- but there was also some good news.</p>
<p>The province released no information about the person who died, other than to say he or she was between 18 and 65 years old and had no known underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>It also said the number of lab-confirmed cases Nov. 10 to 16 had risen by 251, raising the total since Oct. 6 to 543. However, on the bright side, only five patients suspected or confirmed to have H1N1 were admitted to provincial intensive care units in the past week compared with 11 the week before. And as of Thursday, there were only seven H1N1 patients altogether in ICUs.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald Thursday referred to the number of ICU patients as one of the most significant indicators -- more important than the number of confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief public health officer, said while it's too early to detect a trend from the past week's decline in ICU patients, at least the situation is not getting worse.</p>
<p>"It is an indication that at least compared to the previous week we don't have rising rates (of Manitobans becoming extremely ill from H1N1)," he told reporters Thursday.</p>
<p>In another development Thursday, the province announced manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> had asked provinces to temporarily discontinue vaccinating Canadians from a specific batch of vaccine shipped in October.</p>
<p>The reason is that there has been a higher ratio of severe adverse reactions to the vaccine among Canadians than from other lots.</p>
<p>However, most of the vaccine Manitoba received from the suspect shipment had already been used by the time the province received the alert on Wednesday. Of the 63,000 doses shipped, only 630 remained unused by the four regional health authorities in Manitoba that received them, including Winnipeg's.</p>
<p>Kettner said the suspect lot produced serious and immediate anaphylactic reactions in 1 out of 20,000 vaccinations, compared with 1 out of 100,000 in other shipments.</p>
<p>As of Nov. 16, there have been 88 adverse reactions in Manitoba to H1N1 vaccine, of which seven were considered serious. Five of those have been confirmed as anaphylactic reactions.</p>
<p>Kettner said no one in Manitoba has suffered any prolonged adverse effects from the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city's 12 mass H1N1 immunization clinics reported a bump up in numbers Wednesday and Thursday, the first days they were open to all Winnipeggers, according to the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>About 10,000 were immunized Wednesday and 10,500 Thursday, compared to 7,000 to 8,000 in the days leading up to the removal of restrictions on who could be immunized.</p>
<p>Heidi Graham, spokeswoman for the health authority, said clinics were expected to run out of vaccine containing an adjuvant to boost its effect early Friday. Vaccine without adjuvant will still be available but should not be used on children under 10, people over 65 or those with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>The province should receive more vaccine with adjuvant early next week.</p>
<p>Most Winnipeggers interviewed at clinics at Grant Park, St. Mary's Road and in St. James late Thursday morning said it took an hour or less from the time they arrived to the time they left.</p>

<p>Information released</p>
<p>on nine who have died</p>
<p>The province provided specific information for the first time Thursday on the nine Manitobans who have died from H1N1 so far this year. Here are some of the facts:</p>
<p>Two of the nine people were from Winnipeg, with the other seven from regional health authorities outside of the city, including Burntwood/Churchill (2), Central (2), Interlake (1) and NorMan (1).</p>
<p>None of the nine people who died was a senior. Eight were 18-64 years old and one was under 18.</p>
<p>Five were female and four were male.</p>
<p>Three of the nine who died had no underlying risk factors, which include having a chronic disease or an immune disorder, being an alcoholic or having a substance abuse, obesity or being pregnant. One person had one of these underlying conditions, one had two such conditions and four had three or more underlying conditions.</p>
<p>Four of the people who died were aboriginal, while three were Caucasian. The ethnicity of one was unknown, while one was listed as "other."</p>
<p>Breakdown of H1N1</p>
<p>cases across province</p>
<p>Manitoba also provided statistical breakdowns on lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 for both the first (pre-Oct. 6) and second (since Oct. 6) waves of the illness in Manitoba.</p>
<p>A smaller proportion of confirmed H1N1 cases are occurring in the north during the current wave than in the first wave.</p>
<p>-- Since Oct. 6, 274 of 543 confirmed cases have come from Winnipeg, with the next highest total from the Central regional health authority at 78. There were 50 cases in South Eastman, 38 in Assiniboine, 34 in Interlake, 21 in Brandon, 20 in North Eastman, 16 in Burntwood/Churchill and six in each of the Parkland and Nor Man RHAs.</p>
<p>In the first wave, 399 of the 892 confirmed cases were reported by the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, while 189 were reported in Burntwood/Churchill, 58 in Nor-Man, 56 in North Eastman, 54 in Interlake, 47 in Brandon, 29 in Assiniboine, 27 in Central, 17 in South Eastman and 16 in Parkland regional health authority.</p>
<p>In the current wave, 48 per cent of confirmed cases have been people under 18 years old, while 50 per cent have been 18-64 years old and two per cent have been 65 or older. In the first wave, 53 per cent were under 18, 45 per cent were 18-64 and two per cent were 65-plus.</p>
<p>Men have made up 46 per cent of confirmed cases in the second wave, while women have made up 54 per cent. In the first wave, men made up 48 per cent of the cases to 52 per cent for women.</p>
<p>Police issue warning</p>
<p>about fake vaccines</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- Steer clear of counterfeit H1N1 vaccine and look out for fake Tamiflu, say RCMP.</p>
<p>The Mounties cautioned consumers Thursday about online ads offering H1N1 treatments and other cheap drugs, saying the products are most likely phoney and could be dangerous to your health.</p>
<p>And they warned it's illegal to import prescription drugs into Canada and to distribute fake ones.</p>
<p>RCMP say counterfeit H1N1 vaccine and Tamiflu, which is used to treat the pandemic virus, are reportedly being sold on the Internet as concerns about catching the potentially deadly virus spreads worldwide.</p>
<p>Vancouver Canucks</p>
<p>jumped flu shot queue</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- B.C.'s provincial health officer says the Vancouver Canucks definitely jumped the queue when the players and the team's support staff were given the H1N1 vaccine earlier this week.</p>
<p>"They were out of sequence," Dr. Perry Kendall said in a phone interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>But Canuck general manager Mike Gillis says the team did not act until after federal health officials announced on Friday doses of the H1N1 vaccine were now approved for general use and no longer limited to specific groups.</p>
<p>Most of the players, coaching staff and some support staff members received the vaccine on Sunday and Monday of this week. Kendall said they should not have because they don't meet the existing criteria.</p>

<p>FORGET the Ford Focus. A new crew of community paramedics could soon cruise the city in Chevy's newfangled station wagon.</p>
<p>Local car dealer Jim Gauthier is donating a new Chevrolet HHR compact station wagon and a Dodge Caliber hatchback for the Winnipeg Fire Paramedic Service to use during the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>To deal with an influx of 911 calls, the city is on the cusp of launching a new posse of paramedics who will travel the city in cars instead of ambulances.</p>
<p>The one-man units, tentatively called the primary treatment and referral service (PTRS), will be more like nurses who make house calls. They'll be able to triage and treat some of the thousands of non-life-threatening cases called in to 911 every year -- everything from worrisome flu to sprained ankles, diabetes and seizures.</p>
<p>The idea is to take pressure off ambulances and help ease the long wait times at city emergency rooms. If it works well during the pandemic, the city hopes the community paramedics will become a permanent part of the city's emergency services.</p>
<p>Once the PTRS is launched, the city can ramp up to four cars.</p>

</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -- The RCMP are cautioning consumers about online ads offering swine-flu treatments and other cheap prescription drugs, saying many are counterfeit products that could actually endanger health.</p>
<p>During a news conference at Vancouver's international mail processing centre, the RCMP and Canada Border Services Agency displayed thousands of confiscated phony Viagra tablets, among other items, and said suspect Tamiflu doses have recently been intercepted en route to Canadian customers.</p>
<p>Sergeant Duncan Pound of the RCMP's Border Integrity Program linked the traffic to international organized crime groups selling their wares through websites, increasing profit by avoiding quality control and using substitute ingredients.</p>
<p>“It's been our experience that these groups identify a trend or need and then they provide a counterfeit product for people to purchase,” Sgt. Pound said.</p>
<p>“We've seen it extensively with popular products such as Viagra, Cialis and Levitra, which are routinely arriving in Canada from abroad. As you are all no doubt aware, the current world situation with respect to H1N1 vaccination has resulted in recent international reporting of unauthorized and bogus vaccinations being offered for sale.”</p>
<p>There are no reports of anyone getting a phony vaccination in Canada.</p>
<p>But Heather Ardiel, operations chief for the CBSA in the international mail centre, said suspect Tamiflu has occasionally been seized in recent weeks for submission to Health Canada for testing. She had no figures on total seizures or the results of testing.</p>
<p>Officials have the right to open and inspect suspect packages entering Canada from abroad among the 30 million items coming into the country each year. Staff look for suspect packaging and can use X-rays for inspection.</p>
<p>In the Vancouver facility alone, 15,000 suspect packages have been seized in the past six months. Neither Sgt. Pound nor Ms. Ardiel could provide statistics contrasting that figure against the same period last year.</p>
<p>“We know just by virtue of the work that we do here that the numbers are up in terms of [being able] to see the work accumulating, the referrals – as you can see,” she said, referring to dozens of seized items on display.</p>
<p>Sgt. Pound also said there are concerns consumers could obtain flawed drugs that would not properly treat the conditions they are targeting.</p>
<p>“It is playing Russian roulette with your health. The best-case scenario with counterfeit drugs and pharmaceuticals is that what you take is harmless. The worse case is that it is life-threatening,” he said.</p>
<p>Among the intercepted products have been drugs and health supplements contaminated with such substances as arsenic or lead. Counterfeit painkillers and bogus acai-berry products have been seized.</p>
<p>Retailing websites often look Canadian, though the products actually come in from other countries, including China. Sgt. Pound noted that Chinese officials have been co-operating with law enforcement in dealing with the situation.</p>
<p>The timing for yesterday's news conference was dictated by a commitment among members of Operation Pangea II, an effort involving INTERPOL, the World Health Organization and police and health officials in 26 countries to raise the issue of counterfeit drugs and pharmaceuticals being sold online.</p>
<p>But Sgt. Pound admitted H1N1 concerns made the message especially timely.</p>
<p>“We want to redeliver probably an old message to say medicine, pharmaceuticals – those are not items you should go to the Internet for to have mailed to your house,” he said.</p>
<p>It is illegal to import a pharmaceutical or medical product into Canada unless properly designated to do so, but Sgt. Pound said the focus of law enforcement has been on the producers of illicit pharmaceuticals as opposed to the customers.</p>

</div><div>NEIL REYNOLDS   </div>
<div>857 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- reynolds.globe@gmail.com</p>
<p>It should be easy to demonstrate that democracy (however defined) is better for the environment than dictatorship (however defined) – and it is.</p>
<p>Here's one way: Take a reputable environmental ranking of the countries of the world and superimpose it on a reputable democracy ranking.</p>
<p>For the environmental ranking, let's use the Yale University-Columbia University Environmental Performance Index 2009, a scorecard that bases its grades on 25 environmental indicators. For the democracy ranking, let's use Democracy Ranking 2009, an academic Vienna-based scorecard that bases its grades on six democracy indicators (including political, social and economic standards).</p>
<p>The Environmental Performance Index (EPI) puts Switzerland in first place out of 149 countries. The Democracy Rating Index (DRI) puts it fifth.</p>
<p>The EPI puts Norway in second place; the DRI puts it second as well.</p>
<p>The EPI puts Sweden in third place; the DRI puts it first.</p>
<p>The EPI puts Finland in fourth place; the DRI puts it fourth as well.</p>
<p>The EPI puts Costa Rica in fifth place – leading to the first statistical disconnect. The DRI puts Costa Rica 24th, still honourably democratic (between Estonia and Greece).</p>
<p>The EPI puts Austria in sixth place; the DRI puts it eighth.</p>
<p>The EPI puts New Zealand in seventh place; the DRI puts it seventh as well.</p>
<p>The EPI puts Latvia in eighth place – a second disconnect. The DRI puts Latvia 27th, just behind Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The EPI puts Colombia in ninth place – a third and more dramatic disconnect. The DRI puts Colombia 55th (between South Africa and India).</p>
<p>The EPI puts France in 10th place; the DRI puts it 17th.</p>
<p>And so on. Among the top 25 environmentally ranked countries, none is an overt dictatorship; all are democracies of one kind or another. With only infrequent disconnects, each country's democracy indicators match up closely with each country's environmental indicators. (The EPI puts Canada in 12th place, by the way; the DRI puts it in 13th.)</p>
<p>The conclusion is inescapable: Either democracy is closely associated with superior environmental performance – or superior environmental performance is closely associated with democracy.</p>
<p>As for doomsday environmentalist Maurice Strong's beloved China, the world's pre-eminent dictatorship, the EPI puts it in 105th place – with a warning that China's environmental performance is more likely worsening than improving. In its China assessment, the Yale-Columbia index notes that, according to the World Bank, half of China's 1.3 billion people still drink contaminated water. The DRI doesn't score China at all, of course – because it scores zero in its democracy indicators.</p>
<p>In a recent controversial essay, Mr. Strong argues that the human race faces “a real and imminent” threat of extinction, in part because democracies do not have the “discipline and control” necessary to reverse global warming. Further, he argues that only by “modify[ing] ballot-box democracy” can this threat be lessened. But he neglects to disclose why the political system with the world's worst environmental record is the political system that will save humanity. According to a recent study published in the journal Nature Geoscience, China accounted for roughly 75 per cent of the world's increase in carbon emissions last year.</p>
<p>Presumably most people would freely endorse Mr. Strong's arguments – assuming only, for the moment, that his Faustian deal would avert an Armageddon event. It would appear extremely short-sighted to do otherwise. But his arguments rest on an outrageous fallacy: That too much democracy on the ground was the cause of too much carbon in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Although they are in no way persuasive, his arguments are not necessarily without consequences. It is a simple fact that a certain percentage of people, either by conscious choice or by random inclination, favours authoritarian governments. Historically, some of these people have been prepared to swap their ballot for a government that could make trains run on time.</p>
<p>Mr. Strong's affinity for suppressive Chinese one-party governance provides an example. In his essay, he concedes that China has become the world's No. 1 source of carbon emissions. But he argues that people are wrong to blame China. He insists that China has done more (“has undertaken greater measures”) to reduce emissions than has the United States. Criticism of China's record, he says, is “exaggerated and undeserved.”</p>
<p>Yet why, then, do so many Chinese bike to work with masks on their faces? It isn't H1N1. It's PM – particulate matter, the microscopic bits of burned carbon that kills Chinese people in large numbers. China concedes that air pollution kills 300,000 of its people annually; the World Health Organization puts the number at 650,000.</p>
<p>In 2007, the World Bank published a definitive ranking for ambient-air pollution in 110 of the world's largest cities. Of the 25 worst, five cities were in India, a country with ballots; 17 were in China, a country without ballots. The message again is self-evident. Save the ballot box and save the world.</p>

</p>
<p>Threats, kidnapping, intimidation, harassment, vandalism, mischief and theft by native protesters in Caledonia against a family whose house is almost surrounded by the contested site are not valid expressions of a land-claims dispute said Julian Fantino, commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police.</p>
<p>Even so, police typically did not pursue criminal charges against the native protesters during the ongoing occupation of land that was to be developed into a residential subdivision, court heard.</p>
<p>Evidence from the commissioner -- the most senior official within the force ostensibly policing the contested 70-acre site and the town of Caledonia within which it sits -- was entered in court yesterday in a $7-million civil lawsuit.</p>
<p>David Brown, 42, his wife, Dana Chatwell, 45, and their son, Dax Chatwell, 18, are suing the OPP and the province for failing to protect them or enforce the law against native protesters around their home.</p>
<p>Court previously heard of dramatic and dangerous incidents of harassment by protesters against the Brown-Chatwell family throughout the occupation, particularly during a month-long siege in 2006.</p>
<p>Yesterday, sworn testimony from Mr. Fantino, taken during pre-trial hearings, was entered into the official court record.</p>
<p>During his testimony he was asked about a litany of complaints made by the family, including threats from natives of bodily harm and threats to burn down or occupy their home.</p>
<p>"If the threats included threats: 'Your property is next; we're taking over your property' -- not by a somber Confederacy chief but by young people yelling and shouting," asked John Evans, lawyer for the Brown-Chatwell family, "do you agree that that is not an act of asserting a valid native-land claim?"</p>
<p>"I do agree," answered Mr. Fantino.</p>
<p>"And it's not an act of peaceful protest?" Mr. Evans continued.</p>
<p>"That's correct," he answered.</p>
<p>"And it's an act of unlawful intimidation?"</p>
<p>"Could be perceived as such and intended as such, yes," Mr. Fantino said.</p>
<p>When asked if such behaviour by the native protesters was also criminal, Mr. Fantino answered: "In normal circumstances, yes."</p>
<p>Crown lawyer David Feliciant earlier said the allegations in the case "must be understood against the backdrop of the unique character of aboriginal occupations and protests."</p>
<p>Mr. Fantino said, however, that government policy on aboriginal affairs was not the overriding factor in policing the Caledonia dispute.</p>
<p>When asked why OPP officers did not go onto the occupied land to arrest natives believed to be involved in crime he said: "The escalation of conflict and violence and so forth and safety of the officers as well.</p>
<p>"The fallback position always is the lawful use of force as prescribed in the Criminal Code, and that is especially relevant if there is an immediate or an apprehension or a belief that violence would erupt, that people's safety would be put at risk, including police officers of course.</p>
<p>"So that would be the overriding criteria, regardless of what other things might be spoken to or recommended or otherwise flow from even the likes of the Ipperwash inquiry," Mr. Fantino said.</p>
<p>When asked about negotiations between the government and the natives, Mr. Fantino distanced his force from the politics. "It's got nothing to do with us," he said.</p>
<p>"Nothing to do with the police?" asked Mr. Evans.</p>
<p>"No. Our sole purpose is to preserve the peace to the best of our abilities, and not in any way, shape or form negotiate for land or on behalf of parties or deal with any of that."</p>
<p>Court heard that early in 2007, Mr. Fantino was driven around the perimeter of the site by First Nations members.</p>
<p>During his testimony, Mr. Fantino was asked what he learned from the visit.</p>
<p>"It's an expanse of property," he said. "An extremely difficult situation for us to deal with if the situation escalated." And he agreed that the situation of the Browns was of particular concern given that their home was "almost within."</p>
<p>Mr. Brown was expected to be on the witness stand yesterday for continued cross-examination. On Wednesday, however, he was twice excused from the stand so he could make a dash for the washroom to vomit. Yesterday court learned that Mr. Brown's condition had worsened during the night and he was seeking medical treatment.</p>
<p>Amidst concerns he might have H1N1 flu -- Ontario Superior Court Justice Thomas Bielby, perhaps only half jokingly, said he might have to issue everyone masks to prevent participants from "dropping like flies" -- court later learned that Mr. Brown had viral gastritis.</p>
<p>The "read-in" evidence of Mr. Fantino was done in the interim before court was adjourned to Monday.</p>

</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>643 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>HOW IS IT SPREAD?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>CONTAGIOUSNESS</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>TREATMENT</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>VACCINATION</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

<p>Question: What is the difference between an adjuvanted vaccine and a non-adjuvanted vaccine?</p>
<p>Answer: An adjuvanted vaccine includes a substance that boosts an individual's immune system and increases his or her response to a vaccine. An unadjuvanted vaccine has no "booster" element.</p>
<p>Adjuvants are not new and are included in common vaccines such as tetanus and hepatitis B. What is new is that adjuvants have not previously been approved for use with influenza vaccines in Canada. The adjuvant used by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the company producing Canada's vaccine, has been tested extensively on people around the world and has been found to be safe for use.</p>
<p>Question: What are the key ingredients in the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>Answer: Both the adjuvanted and the non-adjuvanted vaccine are made up of the inactivated virus which contains the antigen, thimerosal, sodium chloride, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium dihydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride and water.</p>
<p>The adjuvanted form of the vaccine contains these ingredients as well as squalene (shark liver oil), DL-alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E) and polysorbate 80.</p>
<p>Question: Is there mercury in the vaccine?</p>
<p>Answer: Yes. Thimerosol is a form of mercury used in the vaccine to stabilize it and maintain its quality during storage. There's considerably less mercury in the vaccine than you would find in a can of tuna fish.</p>

<p>Reginans with flu-like symptoms are heeding a warning from the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region to avoid the city's hospital emergency departments unless they're seriously ill.</p>
<p>"We are seeing fewer people coming into the emergency departments wanting to be tested for H1N1 or seeking a doctor's note for their employers," said region spokesman Mark Torjusen. "That would say to us that people have heeded our call to use emergency departments when symptoms become severe."</p>
<p>Patients with influenza-like symptoms who visit the emergency rooms are tracked on a daily basis because of the current pandemic.</p>
<p>From Nov. 11 to 15, 20 to 25 per cent of patients arriving at emergency rooms at the Pasqua and General Hospitals had influenza-like illness. A week later, that number dropped to 13 to 19 per cent of patients with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>As part of its pandemic preparedness plan, the region has increased staffing at the General's emergency room department. Two additional nursing staff -- either RNs or LPNs -- have been added. One works on the day shift, the other on nights.</p>
<p>One additional ER physician is scheduled for afternoons and evenings.</p>
<p>No additional nursing staff have been brought in at the Pasqua Hospital at this point. Emergency room physicians are called in when needed.</p>
<p>Symptoms of influenza-like illness that require urgent medical care include: sudden chest pain, difficulty breathing or increasing shortness of breath, a sudden and severe headache as well as frequent vomiting and diarrhea, which can put the patient at risk of dehydration.</p>
<p>"As always, contact your family physician first," Torjusen said. "If you are uncertain about what to do, contact HealthLine for advice."</p>
<p>The HealthLine's toll-free number, 1-877-800-0002, provides provincial access to a registered nurse, but it is not intended for emergency situations.</p>
<p>At the HealthLine call centre on Thursday, Health Minister Don McMorris commended staff for their hard work -- particularly since the second wave of H1N1 hit the province. Last year, the call centre received an average of 247 calls a day. Lately, HealthLine staff are answering nearly 1,000 calls a day -- an increase attributed largely to questions about H1N1.</p>

<p>Re: Asking H1N1 questions wise strategy (SP, Nov. 14). With a large percentage of the population unlikely to get the H1N1 shot, it's hard to believe you would publish such an uneducated viewpoint.</p>
<p>Bronwyn Eyre has found one doctor in Switzerland who opposes the flu shots. She compares the vaccination to the horrendous effects of Thalidomide in the late 1950s and early '60s. This is faulty logic that intertwines two unrelated things.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization suggests the use of adjuvants for all, pregnant women included. These adjuvants have already been licensed and have been in use with other vaccines for decades.</p>
<p>As for her worry about the mercury content, a quote from the WHO's' website should say it all: "Thimersol does not contain methyl mercury, which is a naturally occurring compound and whose toxic effects on humans have been well studied. Thimersol contains a different form of mercury (i.e. ethyl mercury, which does not accumulate, is metabolized and removed from the body much faster than methyl mercury."</p>
<p>The WHO says "the safety of everyone has been rigorously reviewed by scientific groups. There is no evidence of toxicity in infants, children or adults, including pregnant women, exposed to Thimersol in vaccines."</p>
<p>I suggest that we take the WHO's view on this vaccine and not that of commentator without medical training. Get the vaccine. For everyone's safety.</p>

<p>The temporary assessment centre established at St. Paul's Hospital to screen people with mild flu-like symptoms will remain open until Monday.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region established the centre to ease pressure on city hospital emergency departments, which have seen significant visit increases since the second wave of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Originally, the health region said the clinic would be open until Friday, but would expand if demand continued throughout the week. The centre at St. Paul's is open daily from 4:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Forty patients visited the centre on Tuesday, while 23 used it Wednesday. People are assessed and treated on average within 45 minutes.</p>
<p>Mild flu-like illnesses do not usually require hospitalization and the health region asks that people with these symptoms -- chills, fever, headache, cough, sore throat or runny nose -- use the assessment centre instead of the city's three emergency departments.</p>

<p>Contrary to Windsor Regional Hospital president David Musyj's impression in his Nov. 10 guest column, the focus of conversation in Ontario in recent months has actually been on the abject failure in leadership in our health sector -- including among some of our most senior health and hospital executives.</p>
<p>At a time of intense concern for public health preparedness due to the H1N1 pandemic, we have instead witnessed the departures of the minister of health, the deputy minister of health, and several senior ministry and hospital executives arising from the scandals surrounding eHealth and the failure to adequately safeguard the public interest.</p>
<p>It's a convenient time, no doubt, for some to cast about for other "villains" in health care. However, I am confident the public in Ontario will see through these blatant attempts to make front-line hospital workers the scapegoat.</p>
<p>Musyj mentions that the recent and unanimously decided OPSEU arbitration award provided 2.5 per cent annual increases to certain registered health professionals, but apparently ignores that registered nurses represented by ONA received three per cent this year and will receive three per cent next year from their earlier voluntary settlement.</p>
<p>He also conveniently ignores the salary income increases in recent years among the senior hospital executives at Windsor Regional. In 2005 there were only 13 senior hospital employees receiving salaries of $100,000 or more at Windsor Regional -- costing the hospital only $1,801,539.</p>
<p>But in only three years the numbers jumped to 39 -- 26 more people or triple the number. In turn, that costs the hospital an average of about $1 million each year for a total of $4.8 million -- $3 million more than the $1.8 million spent in 2005.</p>
<p>And David Musyj is the clear winner in the executive salary race; moving from vice-president, corporate services in 2005 with an income of $192,112 to president/CEO with a salary of $276,634 in 2008.</p>
<p>Last year his income increased by $66,448, or 31.6 per cent, when his income went from $210,186 to $276,634. Why is it that senior executives never seem to hold themselves to the same standard they set for working men and women in their employ?</p>
<p>These workers place themselves at risk not only during pandemics like H1N1 or SARS outbreaks but in their daily work lives without the benefit of even the simple right to refuse unsafe work.</p>
<p>These are jobs without long lines that many do not want and/or could not perform, whether as RPNs assisting during surgery or changing a patients' wound dressing; as cleaners disinfecting the operating theatre; as SPD attendants sterilizing surgical equipment.</p>
<p>We should in this debate not forget the nature of the work being performed or how difficult it is to attract and keep people in these positions. In fact, the other two criteria under HLDAA that Musyj did not include in his letter that arbitrators must also take into consideration are:</p>
<p>- A comparison, between the employees and other comparable employees in the public and private sectors, of the terms and conditions of employment and the nature of the work performed.</p>
<p>- The employer's ability to attract and retain qualified employees.</p>
<p>That comparison between employees is generally considered the touchstone of interest arbitration; reproducing or replicating those settlements in both public and private sectors reached for comparable workers through free collective bargaining.</p>
<p>Regrettably, Musyj desires neither to freely negotiate a settlement nor to turn to an impartial arbitrator.</p>
<p>Rather, he calls for the province to simply dictate a wage and benefit freeze, apparently oblivious to the fact that the Supreme Court in 2007 interpreted the guarantee of freedom of association enshrined in the charter to include collective bargaining.</p>
<p>In the end, when the 2010 provincial budget consultations begin, health care workers musts be assured that any sacrifice required will be equitable and balanced.</p>
<p>And all options should be fairly and equitably on the table, including a reversal of previous high income tax cuts and a return to more progressive taxation levels.</p>
<p>To assert that health care funding in Ontario cannot be sustained for 2010-11 ignores that increases in federal transfers to Ontario for health care are set at six per cent annually until 2014.</p>
<p>The financial health of individual hospitals varies considerably, of course, and the Windsor Regional projected deficit pales in comparison to other hospitals.</p>
<p>Many of these other hospitals have resolved through central bargaining their collective agreements with ONA, OPSEU, CAW or CUPE providing for wage increases of two per cent or more this year and next.</p>
<p>For a hospital with the slogan; "Outstanding care ... No exceptions," it seems strange that the CEO would argue that Windsor Regional workers providing outstanding care, who are yet to settle this year, should in fact be the exception.</p>
<p>Ken Lewenza is CAW national president.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Third death linked to H1N1; Nearly 400 influenza cases found</b>
</div><div>Craig Pearson, with files from Chris Thompson   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>605 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>A 47-year-old Essex County man has become the third local person to die after contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"How much the virus contributed to the individual's death, I can't say," medical Officer of health Dr. Allen Heimann said Thursday. "I'm sure it did contribute, but to what degree I cannot say."</p>
<p>The man died Tuesday at Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital, though the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit is still investigating whether he had any pre-existing medical conditions.</p>
<p>Heimann said significantly more than three people die every year in Windsor and Essex County from influenza, but noted that H1N1 is attacking earlier and hitting younger people.</p>
<p>So far almost 400 people locally have been confirmed with influenza A, likely all H1N1.</p>
<p>"It's extremely rare to have this number of cases and therefore this number of deaths at this point," Heimann said. "This is an unusual flu season.</p>
<p>"Traditionally the influenza season in Windsor and Essex County will start in mid-December and continue into March. It's also unusual for the flu virus to affect younger people."</p>
<p>Heimann said most H1N1 cases so far have proven fairly mild, perhaps because younger and usually healthier people are contracting it.</p>
<p>But the third local death connected to the virus is disturbing, especially because the H1N1 season may still not have peaked, he said.</p>
<p>Heimann can't say when the H1N1 season will end. And another regular flu season could still come as it normally does in December.</p>
<p>Therefore, Heimann is encouraging everyone to get immunized.</p>
<p>"We are able to immunize all individuals who wish to receive the immunization, either through our clinics or through physicians' offices," Heimann said. "And we certainly recommend people get immunized, especially those in high-risk groups."</p>
<p>High-risk individuals include those with pre-existing medical conditions such as respiratory problems, pregnant women, children six months to five years old, and health care workers.</p>
<p>Heimann said the H1N1 strain reached its peak in the first week of November, and the number of cases has been diminishing since.</p>
<p>Heimann said of the 394 cases diagnosed so far, 53 per cent have been female and 47 per cent have been male. The average age of those afflicted is 22, and the patients have ranged in age from less than a year to 81, with the median age at 18.</p>
<p>Of the confirmed cases, eight had been immunized.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Light at end of tunnel shinning bright; Even Demitra inching closer as lineup slowly rounding back into form</b>
</div><div>Jason Botchford   </div>
<div>The Province</div>
<div>896 words</div><div>20 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A74</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>There was something odd about the Canucks Thursday. All of the them were on the ice and it wasn't for a team photo.</p>
<p>Daniel Sedin was skating both hard and without pain. Even Pavol Demitra was on hand. He was relegated to the bench and without equipment. But that will change Friday when he skates on his own.</p>
<p>There's no date yet for Demitra's return, but by the end of the weekend he could be the only one still out. Sedin continues to say he won't play until Sunday. But no one should be surprised if he's in the lineup tonight. When he returns, the Canucks will have something a lot of other teams take for granted -- health.</p>
<p>The Canucks have spent the first quarter of the season playing with one arm in a sling, and a foot in a walking cast. They have already lost 109 man games to injury. That's more than half of what they lost all of last year (202) and more than double the NHL average (47). Compare it to the New York Rangers who have lost 21, or the Calgary Flames, who have lost 15, or the Tampa Bay Lightning who've lost just eight.</p>
<p>Even teams which have been hit hard by injuries don't come close. The Detroit Red Wings have lost 52 man games to injuries, the Carolina Hurricanes 58 and the Pittsburgh Penguins 73.</p>
<p>The only team approaching Vancouver's games-missed woes is the Oilers at 105. They needed to get hit by a pandemic flu virus to get numbers that high. That could partially explain why the Canucks showed an itchy trigger finger this week in getting their H1N1 vaccinations. With the luck they've had, the flu must have seemed like it was only a matter of time.</p>
<p>Getting healthy is one thing, what the Canucks do with a (near) full lineup is another. What they can't do is become complacent. They would be smart to remind each other about the last time the club was this intact. That was during the first three games of the season. All them were loose, ugly losses.</p>
<p>Vancouver can't afford too many more of those in the next month or so. These are desperate times. A .500 start and a second-half schedule which could have its own circle in Dante's Inferno, means Vancouver has to start winning.</p>
<p>"We can't just assume it's all going to come together when everyone's back," Roberto Luongo said. "We have to work hard and continue to play our systems as well as we have. That's how we have to win and it doesn't matter who's in the lineup."</p>
<p>The general consensus seems to be the Canucks did well, all things considered, to reach this point of the season with a 11-10 record. Luongo doesn't exactly see it that way.</p>
<p>"Whether we've had injuries or not, I don't think anyone on the team should be satisfied with our record," Luongo said. "I'm not.</p>
<p>"Even though we kept our heads above water, I think the sentiment is we could have done better. We have a lot of weapons on this team and a lot of depth."</p>
<p>Head coach Alain Vigneault gave his team as a whole a passing grade for how it weathered the injury storm during the past month. It's clear, however, there are some players who remain on the wrong end of his bell curve. Alex Edler and Kyle Wellwood, for example, are two who can plan on staying for detention.</p>
<p>"I do think we have a lot of our guys who can play better than they've shown so far," said Vigneault. "Yes, a lot of guys were put on different lines and in different roles and on different D-pairs. But we've gone through all of that here. We are getting healthy and I see this team, having gone through this experience, hitting its stride."</p>
<p>To hit that stride, the Canucks will need to show they learned some important lessons going through all of this. You can put limiting odd-man rushes and backdoor tap-ins at the top of that list.</p>
<p>"I think this situation brought us together and got us playing the type of hockey we need to play," Ryan Kesler said. "When we did have everyone, we weren't playing the way we should. I think when Daniel gets back, we all understand what we have to do to win and we can't lose sight of that again."</p>

<p>Pavol Demitra will take a significant step toward recovery from offseason shoulder surgery today when the Vancouver Canucks winger skates on his own prior to the game-day skate.</p>
<p>Demitra was injured in the second-round playoff series with Chicago when he attempted to check defenceman Brian Campbell into the endboards.</p>
<p>The winger tore his rotator cuff in the front and back and was initially told on Sept. 7 that he would have to avoid contact for five weeks. But after suffering a setback, the best projection now is that Demitra may finally surface in the lineup next month and possibly before Jan. 1.</p>
<p>"That's what we're looking for and we're hoping it's before that," said Canucks general manager Mike Gillis. "For him to skate [today] means he has to have the least amount of pain because you never just skate. There's a puck there and you've got to play with it and it affects the shoulder."</p>
<p>GM DEFENDS FLU SHOTS</p>
<p>Despite a report that stated the Canucks jumped the queue when given the H1N1 flu vaccine this week, Gillis is adamant the club did no wrong.</p>
<p>"Not to our knowledge," he said. "We waited until our information was that it was available to the general public and we gave our players the option of receiving it."</p>

<p>Vancouver Island has recorded its sixth death from H1N1.</p>
<p>"I can confirm that we've had a sixth death from H1N1 on Vancouver Island," Stephen May, spokesman for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said Thursday.</p>
<p>"She was a woman in her [late] 20s from the Cowichan Valley.</p>
<p>"She died on Tuesday night."</p>
<p>The woman had underlying health concerns before coming down with the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"All six who have died have had underlying health conditions," said May.</p>
<p>"Five of the six have been women, including a three-year-old girl."</p>
<p>All deaths on Vancouver Island from H1N1 have been people under the age of 50.</p>
<p>The young woman's death brings B.C's death total from H1N1 to 31 since April 30.</p>
<p>The woman's death is the first since B.C.'s provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall announced Tuesday in his weekly media update that five more British Columbians had died from H1N1, bringing the death total to 30.</p>
<p>The Island Health Authority also confirmed that a three-year-old Nanaimo girl died in hospital in Victoria Monday, becoming one of the youngest to die in the province from H1N1.</p>
<p>"She had underlying health conditions," said May.</p>
<p>Altogether, 750 people have been hospitalized in B.C. with H1N1 since April.</p>
<p>Every B.C. resident will now be eligible to get the H1N1 shot, starting today, Kendall said Thursday.</p>

</p>
<p>With a laugh and a tear I now understand that the practical skills I learned in typing class in high school have stayed with me above and beyond most of the other skills I garnered combined.</p>
<p>Bumping into an old high school mate, Andrew Knott, while at Allancroft Elementary awaiting my daughter's H1N1 vaccination, I was reminded how lost we were as adolescents. We both agree that its almost equally sad as it is funny that we put far more energy into the Rally Club than most other things that we did in at that time.</p>
<p>And ironically, we've both went on to be educators.</p>
<p>Typing class was one of those options often taken just to fill a schedule. It was the "basket-weaving 101" of our grad year if compared with the core subjects. And Mrs. Humphries, our teacher, was a sweet little old thing that most of us took for granted.</p>
<p>I was initially rather indifferent and due to minimal effort, was barely scraping by the course. That was until the Rally Club.</p>
<p>One Monday, we were instructed to do a project - creating an announcement. It was to teach spacing, line separation, underlining and basic set up. It was also a profoundly exciting departure from our previously rigid and seemingly incessant: 'fff space space jjj space ddd ...' life that had predicated this exercise.</p>
<p>We were to centre, on a half sheet of paper, a mock announcement as illustrated for us. The announcement read: "There will be a Rally Club meeting this Thursday, at lunch, in the cafeteria. Bring a friend!"</p>
<p>Upon completion, we were then to move on to the next level, which was basically a repetition of the announcement, slightly updated and upgraded with adjectives, abbreviations and new exclamation points for the following days and so on.</p>
<p>There were three such exercises to be accomplished, and I remember well that it wasn't as easy as it sounded.</p>
<p>If we did it properly, it was to be kept in our portfolio of perfect pieces to be proud of. Mrs. Humphries would subsequently litter our efforts with her little red circles, slashes and cross outs until it was clean.</p>
<p>When I did a clean "perfect piece" (for the first time in my life), before many of the good kids, I was elated.</p>
<p>And apparently devious.</p>
<p>As an unsolicited joke, I submitted my perfect mock announcement assignment to the office secretary for the following morning's announcements. And, sure enough, as the announcement rang through the school hallways and homerooms the next morning, the Rally Club was born.</p>
<p>We followed up on that first announcement as the typing project tapped along, many of us putting greater than usual effort into producing potentially perfect pieces. We even pooled our projects proficiently and amassed a slew of official-looking announcements to be read whenever required.</p>
<p>The Rally Club met for the first time on the first Thursday following the first announcements' success and it rapidly morphed into a wonderful venue for discussing and advertising potential social events littered along our adolescent horizons.</p>
<p>If you wanted to host an event, then a Rally Club announcement would be called via the school intercom and then at lunch in the caf on Thursdays, the information would be shared and publicized accordingly.</p>
<p>Limited minutes were taken.</p>
<p>This rather well organized and functional initiative showed solid leadership promise, however, as unguided as it was, it was also misguided.</p>
<p>The Rally Club almost became an official school club and there is photo of the club and many of its members in the Mac High Beacon of 1984.</p>
<p>The administration, however, eventually caught wind about what the Rally Club really was and my little blurb submitted to accompany the photo for the yearbook offering a rather clever, albeit rudimental (and false) explanation of the club as a whole was blown out along with any future announcements.</p>
<p>Sadly, that little blurb and the Rally Club project was some of my most concentrated work throughout high school.</p>
<p>This effort (or lack therein) brings the tears. The laughter, however, comes every time I tap on keys like j, f or k without any thought whatsoever.</p>

<p>Re: “Stay off the bus” (Letters, Nov. 17).</p>
<p>Posters inside and outside the bus warning people with runny noses or coughs not to get on? Is Michael Shafter joking? That’s half the population of Montreal! It’s winter for heaven’s sake, and a sniffle doesn’t mean someone has the swine flu. This is seasonal-flu and sinus-cold time as well.</p>
<p>I’m so tired of people giving the stink eye every time someone clears their throat. This is getting out of control; next we’ll be shipping everyone who sneezes to their own reservations.</p>
<p>I pay $70 a month to use Montreal’s wonderful transport system, and I’m going to use it, healthy or sick.</p>
<p>And if you don’t like it: Ride your bike.</p>

</p>
<p>A Nov. 30 target date has been set to begin busing Lester B. Pearson students in the West Island to H1N1 vaccination centres.</p>
<p>Off-island, busing for the board's elementary and high school students will take place Nov. 23, 24 and 30 .</p>
<p>The Marguerite Bourgeoys school board has not yet set a target date to begin busing its 45,000 students to a vaccination centre.</p>
<p>"Parents of the on-island students will be receiving consent forms on Monday, Nov. 23, that must be signed if they want their child transported and vaccinated," Mario Barette, the Pearson board's assistant director of community services, responsible for transport, said yesterday.</p>
<p>In the off-island territory to the west of Montreal, Barette said that the numbers of students who will be bused is not high.</p>
<p>"In a school with a population of 400, I am getting 90 consent forms," he said, explaining that many parents have already had their children vaccinated or want to be with their children when they get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Barette said Pearson has 3,783 off-island students and 20,533 students on the island of Montreal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, busing of off-island students at French school boards to vaccination centres has begun.</p>
<p>Off-island vaccination centre hours open to the public have been curtailed to accommodate the students.</p>
<p>"The busing of the elementary and high school students to our clinic during daytime hours means our clinic will be open to the general population - still on a priority schedule - from 4 to 8 p.m. weekdays until Dec. 3," Sophie Boucher, spokeswoman for the Vaudreuil-Soulanges health and social services centre said earlier this week.</p>
<p>Vaccinations had been taking place from noon on weekdays, but with 20,000 elementary and high school students in the area, the vaccination hours for the rest of the public had to be changed, said Boucher.</p>
<p>The off-island vaccination centre will continue to operate from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekends, she said, adding that people wanting to be vaccinated will still have to pick up their appointment coupons in the morning, beginning at 6 a.m. each day.</p>
<p>It was not yet known if the vaccination centres on island will be similarly affected once the busing begins.</p>
<p>For information about the priority list at the off-island centre, go to www.santemonteregie.qc.ca/vaudreuil-soulanges[http://www.santemonteregie.qc.ca/vaudreuil-soulanges], or call 1-866-461-9333.</p>

</p>
<p>There are three places in the West Island - and one off-island clinic - to go for medical attention if you suspect you have been stricken with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The newly-designated flu treatment clinics are the Brunswick Clinic and Statcare Clinic, both in Pointe Claire and the Médistat Clinic in Pierrefonds as well as a clinic at 401-4 Harwood Blvd. in Vaudreuil-Dorion.</p>
<p>"We are hoping this will not only help the population by knowing where they should go for medical help if they suspect they have the flu, it will also ease the situation in hospital emergency rooms," said Danielle Turgeon, spokeswoman for the West Island health network.</p>
<p>"But we want to be very clear: there are no vaccinations available at these flu clinics," she said.</p>
<p>In the West Island, H1N1 vaccinations are available on a priority basis only at H1N1 vaccination centres, at the former Allancroft elementary school, 265 Allancroft Rd. in Beaconsfield and at the former Spring Garden elementary school on Sonata Drive in Dollard des Ormeaux. Off-island, the vaccination centre is at 430 Harwood Blvd., in Vaudreuil-Dorion (between Editions Vaudreuil book store and Tim Horton's.)</p>
<p>Health officials said people should consider going to a flu clinic if they have one or more of the following symptoms: High fever, difficulty breathing, painful breathing, have been vomiting for more than four hours, fever in a child who is too quiet and less active than normal and who refuses to play or is agitated.</p>
<p>Officials at the Lakeshore General Hospital are hoping the flu clinics will help ease the load for staff at the Pointe Claire hospital's emergency room.</p>
<p>While the waiting time on stretchers at the Lakeshore's emergency department has eased over the past few weeks, the number of people going to the ER complaining of flu-like symptoms has increased, hospital spokesman Louis-Pascal Cyr said last week.</p>
<p>Cyr said most patients have been sent home after being seen by a doctor.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 immunization clinics open to everyone in region</b>
</div><div>By Johanna Weidner   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>458 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Everyone in the region can now get the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Region of Waterloo Public Health announced Wednesday morning it was offering the H1N1 flu shot to anyone who wants it, dropping previous eligibility rules that limited the vaccine to only those in priority groups. "This should make it a lot simpler," said regional medical officer of health Dr. Liana Nolan.</p>
<p>Asking people at public clinics about their eligibility and telling those not in priority groups to leave the line was not a task public health staff relished.</p>
<p>"That certainly wasn't something we enjoyed," Nolan said.</p>
<p>The local change in immunization rules followed an announcement earlier in the day by Premier Dalton McGuinty about the province offering the vaccine to the general public.</p>
<p>Many health units in the province had already been giving the shot to anyone interested.</p>
<p>An estimated 93,000 people in the region have been immunized - about one in six. A week earlier, that was only at one in 10.</p>
<p>The country's chief public health officer reported Monday that almost one in five Canadians have been immunized for the H1N1 flu virus. The province's target is to get everybody immunized who wants to be by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The first local public immunization clinic was held on Oct. 31, with vaccine before that going out to hospitals and doctors. Nolan said she is pleased with the progress of the region's immunization program, considering the initial vaccine shortages and delayed shipments.</p>
<p>"I think we've done the best we can given the vaccine supply is out of our control," she said.</p>
<p>The region received another batch of 28,000 doses from the province Tuesday, and Nolan said further problems with the vaccine supply are not expected. Vaccines will still be available in the region in December and they will continue being sent to family doctors, with the majority offering the vaccine to their patients.</p>
<p>Two community immunization clinic dates were added for November. Six remain this month.</p>
<p>Upcoming clinic dates, all from 2 to 8 p.m.:</p>
<p>Thursday - Preston High Secondary School at 550 Rose Ave., Cambridge</p>
<p>Nov. 23 - Waterloo Recreation Complex at 101 Father David Bauer Dr., Waterloo</p>
<p>Nov. 24 - Victoria Hills Community Centre at 10 Chopin Dr., Kitchener</p>
<p>Nov. 25 - Waterloo Collegiate Institute at 300 Hazel St., Waterloo</p>
<p>Nov. 26 - Glenview Park Secondary School at 55 McKay St., Cambridge</p>
<p>Nov. 30 - Kitchener Memorial Auditorium at 400 East Ave., Kitchener</p>
<p>Get upcoming clinic dates on the health unit's automated line at 519-883-2324. For general information about H1N1, call 519-883-2289 or go to www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca[http://www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca].</p>

<p>The Hamilton Bulldogs are taking extra precautions during the current H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>"We're obviously cleaning our dressing room a little more often and HECFI has a plan in place for Copps Coliseum," said Glenn Stanford, president and governor of the American Hockey League team, who noted more hand sanitizers have been set out for players and staff to use.</p>
<p>The team has also made the decision at this point not to send players to area schools as part of the club's education programs.</p>
<p>AHL president Dave Andrews says there has been no discussion among the governors about what to do if teams are decimated by H1N1. The vaccine for H1N1 is currently not covered by the players' health plan but the league has agreed to cover it.</p>

<p>A Hamilton Crown attorney is expected to wrap up her evidence in a six-week murder trial today by linking blood found on the accused to murdered city drug dealer Shaheen Sherzady.</p>
<p>Crown counsel Kim Rogers began the process yesterday by having forensic scientist Alison Morris from the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Toronto testify before an 11-member Ontario Superior Court jury that DNA found in bloodstains on Omar Williams is virtually certain to belong to Sherzady.</p>
<p>Morris said the chances the blood found on Williams' running shoes can't be linked to the victim's DNA is one in 1.4 trillion.</p>
<p>Williams, 25, of Brampton has admitted he is guilty of manslaughter in the July 1, 2007, slaying of Sherzady but has pleaded not guilty to first-degree murder as charged.</p>
<p>Superior Court Justice Alan Whitten began yesterday's proceeding by excusing one male juror who became ill this week with H1N1 symptoms. The trial is expected to wrap up next week with the remaining four women and seven male jurors.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hamilton police Detective Sergeant Ian Matthews testified blood was found on both of Williams' running shoes, as well as on his fingernails, just hours after the slaying.</p>
<p>"Shaheen Sherzady was a middle to upper level cocaine dealer at the time of his death," Matthews testified.</p>
<p>Morris testified blood found on a blue sweat top found near Sherzady's Arkledun Apartments building, on a Smith and Wesson handgun, on heavy channel-lock pliers and on the accused's fingertips and running shoes is a most certain link to Sherzady's DNA.</p>
<p>She testified the chances the blood found on Williams' fingertips can't be linked to Sherzady's DNA is about one in 240,000.</p>
<p>The crown contends Sherzady lost a violent and bloody struggle with two men in an apparent drug ripoff.</p>
<p>The victim was shot once in the chest and bludgeoned about the head with a pair of heavy chain-lock pliers. The blood trail starts on the fourth floor where Sherzady's apartment was located and spills down the stairwell to the parking garage level where the victim's body was found.</p>
<p>While Williams is on trial in connection with the slaying, the second suspect has eluded police. Gavin George Strorer, 31, of Hamilton, is wanted for first- degree murder in connection with the Sherzady killing.</p>

</p>
<p>Montreal public-health authorities today are launching an H1N1 vaccination blitz in the hope of immunizing as many as 170,000 elementary and high school students before the Christmas holidays.</p>
<p>The first part of the campaign has already kicked off, with teams of nurses visiting Montreal Island's 59 special-needs schools to immunize 4,900 children.</p>
<p>Authorities also announced an express line at vaccination centres for children and their parents as of today. The line is for those age 5 to 19.</p>
<p>And on Monday, elementary and high school students across the island will start being bused to vaccination clinics. Authorities hope to bus 9,000 students a day for flu shots.</p>
<p>In preparation for the busing, school boards will send letters to parents in the coming days seeking their consent to have their children inoculated as well as transported.</p>
<p>"We're hoping to complete the vaccination by the Christmas holidays, but it could go longer than that," said senior Education Department official Gisèle Poirier.</p>
<p>Logistically, the mass busing is expected to pose challenges to schools, bus companies and parents. Poirier suggested that some boards might first start busing high school students at least 14 years old, because they don't require parental consent for flu shots.</p>
<p>Students won't have to take the full day off from class or even a half-day, Poirier added, noting that many vaccination centres are close to schools.</p>
<p>To date, 60,000 children have been vaccinated on the island of Montreal. In a bid to ease the burden on schools, vaccination clinics will set aside express lanes for parents and their children as of 2 p.m. weekdays. Mornings will be reserved for schools.</p>
<p>The express lanes will be open all day on weekends.</p>
<p>"We want to encourage parents to come with their children to the vaccination centres," said David Levine, executive director of the Montreal Health and Social Services Agency.</p>
<p>However, Levine cautioned that parents with children older than 6 won't be entitled to a vaccine unless they have a chronic illness.</p>
<p>The English Montreal School Board announced yesterday that parents can be present for their children's vaccination, but won't be allowed to ride the bus with them.</p>
<p>"We have a great concern for the security of students, and we will make sure that they will be accompanied from the moment they leave the school till they reach the vaccination centre, as well as during their return to school," Poirier said.</p>
<p>Levine reiterated that Montrealers at least 65 years old will be able to get a flu shot as of Nov. 30, and the rest of the population as of Dec. 7.</p>

<p>Spotlight</p>
<p>Glee airs Wednesdays on Fox and Global</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Glee, Fox's sharp and subversive musical comedy series, is averaging a respectable 8.6 million viewers a week.</p>
<p>And apparently all of them are going online to champion and celebrate the show, which is turning out to be more viral than H1N1.</p>
<p>Glee may rank 42nd in the Nielsen ratings, but it's a phenomenon on social networking sites such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and MySpace.</p>
<p>"We monitored Twitter feeds," says Chris Albrecht, co-editor of NewTeeVee.com,a website devoted to online video, "and Glee is absolutely crushing the competition. Of all TV shows, it's the one people Twitter about the most."</p>
<p>Fans of the series--imagine High School Musical with a wicked sense of humour--call themselves Gleeks. They have a unique way of expressing their devotion: taping do-it-yourself copycat videos of the show's rousing musical numbers, then posting them on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> or on their individual home pages.</p>
<p>The spontaneous explosion of tribute videos was the first indication to the makers of Glee that their show was hitting a sweet spot with viewers.</p>
<p>"Right after we aired the pilot in May, people started posting their own versions of our songs online," says Dante Di Loreto, Glee's executive producer. "It was so exciting to see because we knew then that we had touched a chord.</p>
<p>"Believe me, I've seen a lot of different versions of our songs," says Di Loreto of the online reproductions. "No matter how crazy they get, it's still flattering."</p>
<p>Things certainly do get loony in these play-at-home versions of Glee. There are videos featuring puppets, <span class="companylink">Disney</span> cartoon characters, even a live leaf bug grooving to the show's cover of Gold Digger.</p>
<p>Most Gleeks avoid the big production numbers and their complex choreography, preferring to imitate the more manageable songs performed by trios or duos.</p>
<p>The vast majority of these knock-offs seem to be shot in bedrooms or finished basements using webcams. They look like outtakes from a sleepover party. The jerky and murky results are often embarrassingly amateurish.</p>
<p>So why do people upload them to the web for all the world to see?</p>
<p>Say hello to the American Idol generation. Everyone is a star waiting to happen. Just add microphone.</p>
<p>"A lot of the literature about contemporary youth in my discipline talks about narcissism," says Alexander Riley, associate professor of sociology at Bucknell University. "This is a generation that is driven in the direction of obsessive concern for self. It's a narcissism with a powerful degree of requiring the approval of others."</p>
<p>Uploading videos, says Riley, "has a lot to do with the role celebrity plays in a society like ours. It's increasingly apparent that many celebrities are made by a particular process. There's the thought, 'If they can be a celebrity, I can, too.' "</p>

<p>Health directors on isolated reserves in northern Alberta credit kilometres of new fibre-optic cables for helping them prepare to fight the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>A small group of technicians, funded by Health Canada and supported by Alberta First Nations chiefs, laid 27 kilometres of fibre-optic cable and connected 43 health centres with high-speed Internet connections last year. They finished months before the first wave of H1N1 hit.</p>
<p>Health Canada was able to host regular, sometimes weekly, interactive video conferences with experts in Ottawa and Edmonton throughout the summer to help communities weigh the dangers and build their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>This summer at the Little Red River Cree Nation, the health centre invited elders and community members to sit in and have their questions answered.</p>
<p>The conferences helped quite a bit, said Velma Hogan, health director in the community of 4,000.</p>
<p>"It's just more information," Hogan said. "Because we're isolated, it really helps."</p>
<p>The Little Red River Cree Nation is at least a 10-hour drive north of Edmonton, about 600 kilometres by air.</p>
<p>Slightly more than 50 per cent of people on reserves have been immunized, with remote and isolated communities among those getting priority for the flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Most rural communities and schools, including schools on reserves, were connected with fibre-optic cable through Alberta's SuperNet system in 2005.But the health centres on reserves were, until last year, still using weak, wireless signals or residential-quality connections.</p>
<p>It was "slow and unreliable," said Duncan Wu, an IT manager seconded from Health Canada to work for the First Nations advisory group.</p>
<p>In addition to video conferencing, the better connection is bringing Telehealth to First Nations communities.</p>

<p>- So, Alberta Health Services is planning to lay off a bunch of people. Would they call that their Duckett list? - When you read about Canadian terrorists attacking our own country and others, you just know someone is granting Canadian citizenship and passports far too easily. - It seems almost everything this city puts its hands on ends up looking like a construction site. Does the Christmas tree in Churchill Square really need a metal fence around it? - A downtown skateboard park is a great idea. It will at least move the drug dealers and gang members away from the entrance to the Stanley A. Milner Library. - Vagrancy is reinforced by the ample provision of food and shelter by various agencies. Reinforcing more positive behaviours in vagrants should be investigated. - Thanks to yet another increase in monthly transit passes, I can now afford to drive to work and park downtown every month.</p>
<p> - I wonder if the people at the Valley Zoo noticed the photo of the parade of elephants in The Journal. This is how elephants are supposed to live, in social groups. - I can't remember the last time I saw a speed trap that wasn't at the bottom of a hill. - Really, if you're going to smoke in your car, why toss the butt out the window?It's not going to stop your car from smelling any different, it just shows you treat the world as your garbage can. - Surely I'm not the only one who is sick and tired of paying Leo Teskey's legal fees for all his appeals. Am I allowed to say, "Let him rot in jail"? - I honestly do not know how Lesley Miller has kept her sanity for so long. - I may be a breast-cancer survivor, but I was delighted the Battle of the Blades' charities did not include mine. There are so many other good causes that don't get the publicity and funds they deserve. - What on Earth would possess you to send your kids to school when you have swine flu in your house? - Christmas advertising starting earlier could be very practical. In a few years, I can save time and money by hosting my Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners on the same day. - The bumper on my 2005 Buick Allure cracked from a bump at five kilometres per hour. No wonder; it's made of plastic and Styrofoam. I had a better bumper on my 1927 Chevy. - Twenty years ago, I worked the front desk at a hotel for$12 an hour. Today, the going rate for a front-desk job is still$12 an hour. - Some scientists agree that 55 million years ago, the climate in the Arctic was tropical. If that's true, then the present Arctic warming may be part of a natural cycle and no amount of human interference will stop it. - The profound insights I put in the comment section of The Journal's website are carefully researched, constructed with flawless logic, set in exquisite prose and yet restrained by a deep humility. They have the power to unlock ancient mysteries, conquer sin, save mankind, spread universal enlightenment, and completely revolutionize spelling. Yet if they're a day old, The Journal doesn't let anyone read them. Such a shame. - I don't much like it, but I can see my wife's point. She thinks Viagra should be sold only to women.</p>

</div><div>Jodie Sinnema   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>692 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>

<p>People should be wary of Alberta Health Services' move to contract out security or other non-clinical services to private companies since it might not save money and could hurt direct clinical care, a local researcher says.</p>
<p>Health regions in the mid-1990s off-loaded laundry, food and some lab services to private companies in much the same way the health authority is now planning to contract out security services as announced Tuesday, said Donna Wilson, nursing professor at the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>Problems ensued, she said, with lab companies initially providing questionable test results and faxing personal information to the wrong people.</p>
<p>At the University of Alberta Hospital, a once reputable kitchen service that provided warm, ample, fresh meals to people, was replaced with private companies that provided "plastic" one-size-fits-all meals, Wilson said.</p>
<p>Alberta's health region plans to move security services to a contractor. Although it couldn't estimate how much the move will save, about half of 200 security workers are expected to find jobs with the new contractor.</p>
<p>"It needs to be planned very, very carefully because security people and cleaners, and kitchen people and laundry people, they are all part of the team that makes sure you get safe and effective and high quality health care," Wilson said.</p>
<p>She said security is important to health and safety, and include officers who respond immediately to emergency wards when unstable patients hit staff, as well as those who sit outside hospital rooms 24 hours a day to make sure confused patients don't pull out medical tubes and run away, potentially spreading an infection into the community.</p>
<p>"Some people don't worry about privatization. I do," Wilson said. She said private providers are there to make money and often offer lower paying jobs with few benefits and no pension.</p>
<p>"Usually, what we have is a creation of McJobs," she said. "At the end of the day, we're really thinning out the middle class. Privatization means that there are less people with secure, good-paying jobs."</p>
<p>Health authorities can also still end up paying more, Wilson said. In the United States, when hospitals decided to use private nursing companies to supply nurses, some ended up paying double for the administrative costs, then got nurses who had no familiarity with the hospital and had less training than the regular staff.</p>
<p>Wilson said Alberta Health Services' goal to erase duplications in the system--having one payroll department instead of nine separate ones for the former health regions, for instance--makes sense, but she said it will create disruption.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of good about this," Wilson said, but people should remain on alert. "When we've got bottom line cost effectiveness as the driving force, nurses and people should always be concerned about their jobs and the quality of health care."</p>
<p>Alberta's cash-strapped health superboard has already started on a massive job reduction plan that could eliminate more than 1,000 positions. At least 660 jobs have been cut, left vacant by Alberta Health Services in a bid to save $66 million each year and bring down its project $1.3-billion deficit. Another 550 employees, including lab technicians, dietitians and emergency workers, have expressed interest in voluntarily retiring, although the health authority has yet to accept their applications.</p>
<p>Heather Smith, president of the United Nurses of Alberta, said nurses also voted to be a part of the program that gives them some money to voluntarily retire.But she said the union is only recommending those close to retirement consider it.</p>
<p>Since that only applies to a small proportion, Smith said she expects more aggressive layoffs to happen in the new fiscal year, even though Alberta Health Services said now is not the time to let nurses go, since they're needed in the fight against the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"I find that insulting," Smith said. "It's disrespectful to our profession and to the role and contribution nurses have made to this province in recent years."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Reduced deficit figure spells relief for Tories; Falling construction costs, higher investment earnings aid finances</b>
</div><div>Trish Audette; With files from Archie McLean   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>759 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach's beleaguered Conservatives may have turned the corner on a bad autumn with news Alberta's projected deficit has fallen to $4.4 billion from$6.9 billion.</p>
<p>But ahead of an official fiscal update Nov. 30, members of Stelmach's government stopped well short of declaring victory Wednesday.</p>
<p>"Let's make no mistake, a deficit is a deficit and our government takes a deficit really seriously," Finance Minister Iris Evans said. "Regardless of what the number is, we're still going to work on managing our expenditures."</p>
<p>Still, the appearance of prudent fiscal management could be the "road to redemption" for the governing Tories, Mount Royal College political scientist Keith Brownsey said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The government's autumn has been pitted with a bye -lection loss in Calgary in September, sinking results</p>
<p>in public opinion polls, rural angst over a proposed power transmission line law, and problems with the H1N1 flu-vaccination program.</p>
<p>But hanging over government members' heads has been a budget deficit for this fiscal year, a first planned deficit in the province in over a decade.</p>
<p>The deficit, covered off by the province's multibillion-dollar sustain-ability fund, has pushed issues of public-sector wage freezes, program cuts and borrowing money to the forefront. While the right-wing Wildrose Alliance Party has poked holes at the government's fiscal management, even a small group of backbencher Tories calling themselves the "Fiscal Four" have begun asking cabinet ministers tough questions about how they plan to reign in spending.</p>
<p>"It would seem to me that the state of Alberta's finances is going to be a major determinant of the political fortunes of Ed Stelmach," Grant Mac-Ewan University political scientist Chaldeans Mensah said.</p>
<p>"Any improvement of the fiscal situation, I think, will translate into a positive assessment of his government."</p>
<p>Last month, Mensah said, Stelmach won "respite" when party members gave him a 77-percent approval rating. But a cabinet shuffle and other changes of personnel may still be on the table.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Stelmach has said he'll make changes if and when he is ready. He has declined to comment on moving any specific ministers into or out of their current jobs.</p>
<p>Mike Percy, dean of the University of Alberta's business school, said the softening of Alberta's deficit outlook could have a positive effect on public opinion. But, "I would suspect the catalyst for change is driven by a different set of circumstances than the budget, per se."</p>
<p>On balance, the provincial government may well have been lucky in its second quarter, Percy said. Internationally, markets are doing better, which helps Alberta's investments and the Heritage Savings Trust Fund. Construction costs have fallen, which benefits the province. A deficit decrease of $2.5 billion could point to the government finding savings in its operations.</p>
<p>"I suspect as well that they have been moving aggressively in constraining health-care costs," Percy said. "On the other hand, gas prices are still significantly lower than forecast in March (and) the Canadian dollar is significantly higher....</p>
<p>"There's just a lot of things moving simultaneously. Some work to the benefit of the government, some work against."</p>
<p>Treasury Board president Lloyd Snelgrove said oil prices have been stronger in the second quarter, which has led to higher revenues. But he cautioned against reading too much into every twist and turn of the province's finances, saying people should look at the overall picture.</p>
<p>"If you actually go back even last year, the deficit ended up pretty close to what we projected to start with but it was quite a wild ride in the middle," Snelgrove said. "If you get all excited in the middle, when the numbers are moving, it's not a real picture."</p>
<p>Neither Evans nor Snelgrove would discuss how the province has found the hoped-for $430 million in savings this year, or plans for$2 billion in savings in 2010-11.</p>
<p>But Liberal Leader David Swann said the higher revenues reflect poor planning. He believes the government has allowed the province's finances to be held hostage by global oil and gas prices.</p>
<p>"We are so dependent on one commodity we have planned not for the future, but for oil and gas prices," he said. "This is not leadership, this is not good management."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Dunn to probe H1N1 program; Auditor general will determine whether Alberta plan was properly executed</b>
</div><div>Archie Mclean, Jodie Sinnema and Trish Audette   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>811 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta's auditor general will examine the province's swine flu vaccination program over the next few months to see if the plan was properly implemented and clearly communicated.</p>
<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert said the government has nothing to hide and vowed that Dunn will be free to look into any program he wishes.</p>
<p>Liepert said Wednesday he will ask the province's Treasury Board for emergency funding to cover the costs of the vaccination program.</p>
<p>"I look at it the same way as how we fund forest fires," Liepert said in response to Liberal questions in the legislature. "Those are the things that are not expected, not budgeted for...."</p>
<p>Liepert said he won't know the total costs for several more months, but estimated the bill will be well under $100 million.</p>
<p>The federal government covers 60 per cent of the cost of the vaccine, but the province pays for its administration, as well as other costs to the health-care system.</p>
<p>Treasury Board president Lloyd Snelgrove said he can't consider the request until final numbers come in, but said there's a good chance the money will come from the sustainability fund.</p>
<p>"I think the general consensus around the caucus room would be that this is an extraordinary expense," Snelgrove said.</p>
<p>The government uses its sustainability fund to cover disasters such as floods, fires or the recent pine-beetle infestation. Alberta Health Services currently has a deficit of roughly $1.3 billion.</p>
<p>Auditor General Fred Dunn, who plans to retire in February, said his department's final report on the vaccination program will be finished in the new year and will likely be released next October.</p>
<p>Dunn's department will study the government's pandemic planning, implementation and the results, along with the costs and consequences of the program.</p>
<p>"When we plan for an emergency, do we properly communicate it?" Dunn asked. "When we implement it, do we properly communicate?"</p>
<p>The auditor general's job is to examine whether government programs meet expectations and are cost efficient.</p>
<p>The chief medical officer of health said the province will co-operate with the auditor general's office.</p>
<p>"We'll collaborate and open our books to the decisions that we made as we made them," Dr. Andre Corriveau said.</p>
<p>The province announced that all children under 18 and their parents can head to H1N1 vaccination clinics starting Friday, and plans are to open the doors early next week for the general public.</p>
<p>"They don't all have to rush on the first day," said Corriveau.</p>
<p>He said Alberta has close to 500,000 H1N1 doses now, with a similar number expected to be delivered next week.</p>
<p>So far, approximately 600,000 Albertans have received their shots; most were in high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Although the flu is no longer spreading as fast in the community --with few schools reporting absentee rates above 10 per cent--Corriveau</p>
<p>said the virus won't disappear before a third wave hits sometime in the new year.</p>
<p>"Things will decrease over the next few weeks, but it won't go away," Corriveau said. "The virus will just bide its time. There's always a third wave, and historically with pandemic viruses they keep trying to come back until either everyone has been infected," or until many people become protected with a vaccine.</p>
<p>He said getting vaccinated is key, especially since there is a chance the virus could mutate between waves, making treatment with Tamiflu ineffective. Last year, the seasonal influenza became resistant to Tamiflu.</p>
<p>"So far, this virus has shown remarkable stability," Corriveau said. "But certainly there is a potential between wave two and wave three that additional shifts or drifting could occur in the virus."</p>
<p>He said the province is now in discussions with doctors, pharmacists and employers to see if they, too, can distribute the vaccinations and take some pressure off immunization clinics once they open to everyone. Those plans depend on how many doses the province continues to receive.</p>
<p>"Our goal was always to immunize as many people as possible," Corriveau said.</p>
<p>He said Alberta has recorded a higher proportion of deaths than many other provinces--a total of 43 so far, including one child and only one person who didn't have chronic medical issues--because the infection is moving west to east in Canada.</p>
<p>Eastern provinces are still seeing an upswing in the number of illnesses, Corriveau said, while Alberta's infection rate is slowing.</p>
<p>He said Alberta's death statistics also line up with the proportion of the population with chronic health problems, such as asthma, diabetes or obesity.</p>

</div><div>Lyndon Little   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>736 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>As a reward for their hard work and success over the regular season, both the SFU men's and women's soccer Clan earned the right to home games in the first round of the NAIA national tournaments.</p>
<p>At least that's what they thought.</p>
<p>Due to passport issues for their opponents, SFU has reluctantly agreed to play those "home" contests Saturday afternoon at Whatcom Community College in Bellingham.</p>
<p>The Clan women face Point Loma Nazarene of San Diego at 12:30 p.m. followed by the SFU men versus Warner Pacific College of Portland at 4 p.m.</p>
<p>"You play all season for the right to be at home, but I guess this is a sign of the times," says Clan women's coach Shelley Howieson. "Last year, we played an American team up here in the playoffs. But at that time there wasn't a passport issue for land entries."</p>
<p>Of the two SFU squads, it appears the women's team faces the biggest uphill battle in terms of qualifying for the next playoff round. With a 7-6-3 overall record, the women Clan go into the NAIA tournament seeded ninth after needing an at-large berth because they failed to win the Association of Independent Institutions (AII) tournament last week in Phoenix.</p>
<p>"We were hoping for a little more offensive push than we got this year," says Howieson, in her 22nd year as head coach. The team has scored just 19 goals over 16 games. "But I feel this is a team that has shown it plays its best in the big games."</p>
<p>Howieson doesn't know a lot about Point Loma, which comes into the tournament with a 12-4-3 mark, but is expecting a stiff test.</p>
<p>"They come from probably the most competitive NAIA conference [the Golden State Athletic Conference]," she says. "I expect they'll be a high-calibre team with some highly skilled players. We've had a bit of a funny season. It seemed whenever we started to get on a roll some little thing like an injury knocked us sideways. But I feel we'll match up well Saturday. I feel we've got a defence that can lock things down."</p>
<p>The Clan men go into the tournament as the No. 5 seed carrying an impressive 17-3-0 mark.</p>
<p>"We're very pleased with the way the season has gone so far," says Alan Koch, in his second year as head coach. "We've scored the most wins for the program in the past 20 years. I feel the strength of our team is our variety of scorers. We don't rely on one or two players. And also our overall defence. We've managed 10 shutouts so far this year."</p>
<p>Last year, the men Clan reached the AII final, but lost and were not invited to the national tourney. This year, they went undefeated at the independent tourney, scoring back-to-back 1-0 shutouts.</p>
<p>"We played Warner Pacific in our first game of the season [SFU won 6-1], but since then they've added a couple of late recruits," notes Koch. "They appear to be peaking at the right time. They're a very physical team and we've got to be prepared to match their physicality."</p>
<p>CLAN CHOWDER: SFU is setting up a scholarship to honour the memory of Clan quarterback Bernd Dittrich, with the scholarship to go to a foreign student attending SFU.

<div id="hd"><b>Online fans go gaga for Glee; 'Gleeks' delight in online mimicry of the show's musical numbers</b>

</p>
<p>Glee, Fox's sharp and subversive musical comedy series, is averaging a respectable 8.6 million viewers a week.</p>
<p>And apparently all of them are going online to champion and celebrate the show, which is turning out to be more viral than H1N1.</p>
<p>Glee may rank 42nd in the Nielsen ratings, but it's a phenomenon on social networking sites such as <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and MySpace.</p>
<p>"We monitored Twitter feeds," says Chris Albrecht, co-editor of NewTeeVee.com, a website devoted to online video, "and Glee is absolutely crushing the competition. Of all TV shows, it's the one people Twitter about the most."</p>
<p>Fans of the series -- imagine High School Musical with a wicked sense of humour -- call themselves Gleeks. They have a unique way of expressing their devotion: taping do-it-yourself copycat videos of the show's rousing musical numbers, then posting them on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> or on their individual home pages.</p>
<p>The spontaneous explosion of tribute videos was the first indication to the makers of Glee, which airs at 9 p.m. Wednesdays on Fox, that their show was hitting a sweet spot with viewers.</p>
<p>"Right after we aired the pilot in May, people started posting their own versions of our songs online," says Dante Di Loreto, Glee's executive producer. "It was so exciting to see because we knew then that we had touched a chord.</p>
<p>"Believe me, I've seen a lot of different versions of our songs," says Di Loreto of the online reproductions. "No matter how crazy they get, it's still flattering."</p>
<p>Things certainly do get loony in these play-at-home versions of Glee. There are videos featuring puppets, <span class="companylink">Disney</span> cartoon characters, even a live leaf bug grooving to the show's cover of Gold Digger.</p>
<p>Remember the sparkly rendition of Burt Bacharach's I Say a Little Prayer delivered by three lissome cheerleaders on one episode?</p>
<p>Imagine it painstakingly reenacted by three bearded gay men in baby T-shirts.</p>
<p>"People say, 'You should do it in drag,'" says Jason Whipple, who lip-syncs the lead. "I say, 'We ARE doing it in drag! It's boy drag.'"</p>
<p>Whipple, who recently moved to San Francisco from Vermont, made the clip as a lark in his apartment with two friends and a digital camera. They dubbed their hirsute trio the Full Silkwood, after a typically audacious punch line from the show.</p>
<p>His little jape has turned Whipple into a minor celebrity.</p>
<p>"I was walking with a friend of mine to a coffee shop," he says. "A couple of people stopped us. 'You're the guy from the video!' My friend was like, 'You just moved here a month ago. How does everyone know you?'"</p>
<p>One of the more ambitious tribute videos is a shot-for-shot restaging of the pilot's showstopper, Journey's Don't Stop Believin'.</p>
<p>Filmmaker Wes Kim recruited six friends for the reenactment, shot in downtown Seattle. Because he didn't have a portable device to play back the episode, Kim had to refresh his memory of the source material by different means.</p>
<p>"Everyone had iPhones and smartphones," he says. "So for specifics, we would watch bits of it on the spot."</p>
<p>More than 2 million songs by the Glee cast have been purchased on iTunes.</p>
<p>Last week, six selections from the show were among iTunes' top 200 downloaded songs.</p>
<p>Nine episodes were among the Top 200 in TV sales.</p>
<p>And Glee: The Music, Vol. 1, which was released Nov. 3, sold 113,000 copies its first week, capturing the No. 4 spot on the Billboard 200 chart.</p>
<p>The number of tribute videos may really go through the roof in the next few months if a novel initiative by the show's producers pans out.</p>
<p>"Based on fan demands, we're going to include instrumental versions only on some special editions of the soundtracks as an added element," says Di Loreto.</p>
<p>The second soundtrack will be released early next month.</p>
<p>"It'll make it easier," he says, "for people to do karaoke versions of our songs."</p>
<p>As though Gleeks need any more encouragement.</p>
<p>Colour Photo: Glee's songs inspire many fan tributes. 'No
matter how crazy they get, it's still flattering,' says the show's
executive producer.

<div id="hd"><b>Two-tier health, two-tier education; PQ is pressuring Liberals to close Bill 101 loophole</b>
</div><div>DON MACPHERSON   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>692 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A25</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>It was <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World's free Fastpass system for reserving ride times that inspired a Gatineau health official and former <span class="companylink">Disney</span> visitor named Denis Beaudoin to originate Quebec's efficient system of vouchers for organizing H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>And there's evidently a platinum Fastpass for access to public services, in the form of either wealth, celebrity or connections.</p>
<p>Quebec's current poster boy for privilege is pre-90s pop idol Claude Dubois. First he was spotted emerging with his family from a clinic after being ushered through a back door for their flu shots ahead of the hundreds lined up around the building in the cold. And then he was caught lying about it by La Presse columnist Patrick Lagacé.</p>
<p>For his sins, Dubois was required to confess last Sunday to the province's high priest of popular culture, Guy A. Lepage, on the Radio-Canada television talk show Tout le monde en parle.</p>
<p>Only after apologizing (while blaming the system for making everybody else line up) and bowing his auburn-dyed head in contrition did the weaselly ex-junkie receive absolution from Lepage's sidekick Dany Turcotte and permission to plug his new CD of Christmas songs.</p>
<p>Not only does Quebec have two-tiered access to health care, it has also had a two-tiered system for admission to English-language schools.</p>
<p>Bill 101 generally restricts admission to English schools to children who have already received most of their elementary or secondary education in English in Canada, or whose parents, brothers or sisters did.</p>
<p>But since the restrictions do not apply to schools that do not receive any government funding, parents who can afford tuition fees at an unsubsidized English school can buy their children's way around them.</p>
<p>Since the officially-entitled French Language Charter was adopted in 1977, the only question has been whether this privilege should be available only to the really wealthy or to the middle class as well.</p>
<p>It comes down to setting the price for buying the right to an English education.</p>
<p>Should it be a tuition fee that can exceed $15,000 for every child for every year of her education?</p>
<p>Or should it be the low, low bargain price of the same fee but for only one child for only one year, after which not only he but also his brothers and sisters and his children could attend English public schools for free?</p>
<p>The answer was the lower price, until the one-year loophole was closed in 2002 by the adoption of Bill 104 by the Parti Québécois government of the day, with the support of the Liberal opposition.</p>
<p>It was lowered again last month, if only in theory, when the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that Bill 104 violates minority language rights, but suspended its ruling for a year.</p>
<p>This gives Quebec time to try to come up with something else that doesn't violate the constitutional Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>But it also forces the Charest government to do something it has sought to avoid since it came to power six years ago, which is to legislate on language.</p>
<p>And it can't simply re-introduce Bill 104 with a so-called "notwithstanding" clause, since the latter can't be invoked for a violation of minority language rights.</p>
<p>The PQ thinks it has the answer. Last week it proposed to extend Bill 101's restrictions on admission to fully private English schools. It cited experts in constitutional law saying such a measure could be challenged only as a violation of freedom rather than minority language rights, and could therefore be shielded by a notwithstanding clause.</p>
<p>The Charest government was caught off-guard by the PQ's proposal and has yet to respond to it.</p>
<p>But if it can't show that the proposal would be unconstitutional, political pressure might force it to put an end to the inequity of allowing some to buy a right that others can't afford.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Home-care cuts prompt public outcry; Physicians, nurses sign petition criticizing move</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>868 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>In an unusual and highly public gesture, at least 15 physicians and nurses at The Ottawa Hospital have signed a petition criticizing cuts to Eastern Ontario's home-care program and urging the province to intervene.</p>
<p>"The situation is putting vulnerable patients at risk and health-care practitioners in a challenging situation," wrote Dr. Michèle Tremblay, a geriatric psychiatrist at the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre.</p>
<p>"The lack of available home care is seriously impacting the length of stay of my patients" and denying sicker patients access to a hospital bed," wrote Dr. Anthony Weinberg, the hospital's chief of internal medicine.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, the doctors and nurses say, sudden cuts to home-care services have left a growing number of elderly patients languishing in hospital beds next to people suffering from highly infectious flu-like illnesses.</p>
<p>At the same time, they say, dying patients are being denied their wish to spend their final days in their own homes, a more humane and cost-effective alternative to expensive hospital care.</p>
<p>The Eastern Ontario agency in charge of home care is facing a $6.5-million budget shortfall, forcing it to cut staff and maintain waiting lists for high-demand services.</p>
<p>In practice, that means the Champlain Community Care Access Centre (CCAC) has stopped taking new clients and scaled back services that range from in-home nursing visits and personal support, to physiotherapy and end-of-life care for people with terminal illnesses.</p>
<p>Kim Peterson, the CCAC's vice-president of client services, said the agency was triaging clients based on need, with less-urgent cases being put on a waiting list.</p>
<p>Peterson would not say how many clients were waiting for services or how long they could expect to wait.</p>
<p>"We're going with the highest priority clients and meeting their needs first," she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Ruth Ellen, a geriatrician at The Ottawa Hospital, said she tried this week to arrange for one of her elderly patients to receive palliative care at home, only to be told the service was not available.</p>
<p>"Until recently, the CCAC was able to help palliative-care patients quite quickly, but now these people are in the same boat as most of my other patients and they cannot get any access," Ellen said.</p>
<p>In the hospital's geriatric department, as many as 17 patients a week who could be discharged to their homes if they had a little more support, have been left in limbo. Dozens more are stranded in other parts of the hospital, with many overflow patients occupying beds in the emergency room, Ellen said.</p>
<p>The backlog of elderly patients causes gridlock, leading to cancelled surgeries, bed shortages and long emergency-room waits. In recent weeks, the overcrowding has resulted in many frail elderly patients being parked in beds next to patients suffering from suspected H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Mary Peterson learned of the home-care cuts after her mother-in-law died earlier this week. In the weeks before her death, Mildred Peterson, who had terminal cancer, had received palliative care in her home as well as twice-weekly visits from a personal-support worker.</p>
<p>"My sister-in-law was the sole caregiver," Mary Peterson said. "There was nobody else in the home except for her and her mother, and there would have been no way that she would have been able to care for mum 24 hours a day and keep her at home without home care."</p>
<p>Already, as many as five physiotherapists and one social worker contracted by the CCAC have received layoff notices, and union officials are bracing for more job losses.</p>
<p>The CCAC's Peterson would not comment on how many home-care workers had lost their jobs.</p>
<p>The Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists has indicated that some of its Eastern Ontario members are affected. Occupational therapists perform in-home assessments to determine what support services elderly clients need to move back home from hospital.</p>
<p>"People are being wait-listed, which means they're not being seen," said Claudia von Zweck, the association's executive director. "The other situation is that people who are going home aren't being properly assessed, and so, when they go home and run into problems, they end up being readmitted to hospital."</p>
<p>According to Hannu Harinen, the CCAC's chief financial officer, the agency has seen a sharp increase in the number of home-care clients this year, largely because of a provincewide effort to expand in-home support programs for seniors.</p>
<p>In addition, many clients are receiving more services, resulting in services such as nursing, personal support and medical equipment running over budget. Harinen told a CCAC board meeting on Wednesday that the agency expected to end the fiscal year, which ends March 31, with a $5.4-million deficit, which represents about three per cent of its $180-million budget.</p>
<p>The situation is a sharp reversal for the CCAC, which earlier this year scrambled to find ways to spend $2 million as it approached the end of the fiscal year because it couldn't find enough people to provide home care.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Merely 'drums and feathers'; When the torch passes through Canada's aboriginal communities it won't shed any light on the poverty that keeps their children from the Olympic dream</b>
</div><div>Laura Robinson   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>1044 words</div><div>19 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>In April 1991, Olympic kayaking gold medalist Alwyn Morris of Kahnawake brought together aboriginal leaders who cared deeply about the health and wellness of young people. He also invited decision-makers from Sport Canada, who heard about the hopelessness and poverty that envelopes so many First Nation communities, where buying something as commonplace for non-native people as a good pair of children's running shoes, let alone finding funds for an ice rink, is a dream. Morris envisioned a day when a Canadian Olympic team actually reflected the 3.8 per cent of the Canadian population that identifies as aboriginal.</p>
<p>If we have 200 athletes on the 2010 Olympic team, seven to eight should be aboriginal. But even Tewanee Joseph, CEO of Four Host First Nations, the aboriginal group that represents the four nations on whose traditional lands the Games will take place, admits he knows of no aboriginal athletes on our team to Vancouver.</p>
<p>This October, more than 18 years after Morris's meeting, I found myself in Ottawa with a new generation of aboriginal leaders in sport and they were grappling with the same issues that representatives in 1991 had to confront. There is still no ministry or department in the federal government whose duty it is to ensure long-term funding and support so aboriginal people can lead healthy, active lives.</p>
<p>Sport Canada did not, despite hearing many heartbreaking stories, decide to run with this particular torch. Their policy on aboriginal people and sport has non-committal language to prevent the government from taking action.</p>
<p>In the 18 years since that first meeting, children have been born and are now young adults -- all the while missing out on physical activity opportunities because, simply put, they are not a priority in this country. How could they be when Canada and the United States are the only countries that refuse to sign the UN's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples?</p>
<p>Aboriginal sports leaders spend most of their time trying to raise money from people with none. They scramble to borrow sports equipment, rent vans with their own cash because so few parents have safe vehicles, and supply healthy food and clean water so when kids get hungry and thirsty after playing sports, they don't also get sick. There was an incredible energy in the leaders I met most recently, but their task is monumental. They are expected to move mountains with money raised at bake sales.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we saw aboriginal people in northern Manitoba fall critically ill and die from H1N1 flu in a way that wasn't happening in non-native communities. If you go to these communities you will find houses contaminated with mold, open insulation next to mattresses on floors in extraordinarily tiny living quarters, and shared slop buckets as toilets instead of running water.</p>
<p>How shameful such conditions exist in a county this rich. Should the Olympic torch relay touch down among such poverty, there will be no photo-ops inside moldy, dilapidated homes. We'll see shots of excited children, but when the torch leaves, so will any attention and the nickels and dimes that happen to come along with it. Those children will again be abandoned by a sport system that only shows up to exploit their trust.</p>
<p>Canadians should not be lulled into a complacency that allows them to imagine poverty disappears in the lives of aboriginal people because we shoot through their community with a torch, or we buy Olympic gear made in Haiti, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and China that sports an aboriginal design. Or that just because aboriginal people will perform in the opening ceremonies their drinking water is now safe; their kids have sports and recreation programs and they'll be vying for a spot on our next Olympic team. The Olympics and sport in general should not be a smokescreen for what is Canada's worst legacy of all: a deeply embedded racism that denies aboriginal people agency in their own lives.</p>
<p>VANOC's Aboriginal Youth Gathering from Jan. 30 to Feb. 14 is a perfect example. First of all the youth are sent home almost as soon as the Games begin -- suspiciously soon after the evening opening ceremonies of Feb. 12 when the real mega-millions will be made off broadcast rights. If any of the young people from the youth gathering are performing in them, they must sign away all rights to even one cent of the revenue. In order to come to the gathering, you have to agree to "volunteer."</p>
<p>They had to sign a VANOC contract over five pages long that stipulates, among other things, they will not be paid for their services; or have any rights to revenues generated through their artistry and talent. They have to bring their dancing regalia or drums to Vancouver; in fact in order to be considered they must send a photo of themselves in regalia -- not in the 21st-century clothing they normally wear.</p>
<p>The youth must be able to take direction and perform in front of an international audience, but the contract takes away all their rights as artists. If they compose music, create visual art, choreograph a dance, or dance and drum while in Vancouver, not only will they not be paid for it, they will not be allowed to own their own creations.</p>
<p>When Morris opened his meeting in 1991 he said aboriginal people are tired of being "drums and feathers" trotted in to entertain white people. Alex Nelson, CEO of the B.C. Aboriginal Sport and Recreation Association, said aboriginal people are alive, thinking, dynamic human beings; not artifacts in a museum. Real words drowned out by Olympic myths.</p>

</p>
<p>Let me see if I've got this right. If you have H1N1, you should self-isolate; but it is nearly impossible to find out whether you actually have the virus, since tests are being done only at hospitals and only in extreme cases.</p>
<p>If you have the virus, you shouldn't get vaccinated. But of course you can't know whether you have it without a test, and they aren't testing. So you are encouraged to line up for the vaccine anyway, whether you should get it or not, and whether it is actually available today or not.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind that yours may already have been purchased by someone more important than you, or simply thrown out.</p>
<p>Come here. Go away. I think I understand.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Selinger plans short sitting for MLAs - Nov. 30 throne speech to lay out NDP's plan</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen    </div>

</p>
<p>Manitoba's new premier, Greg Selinger, and his recently revamped cabinet get down to business Nov. 30.</p>
<p>That's when the NDP government will outline its agenda for the coming year in a speech from the throne, presented by Lt. Gov. Phillip Lee, and followed by eight days of debate before the house breaks Dec. 10 for Christmas.</p>
<p>Opposition Progressive Conservatives and the Liberals say this is the bare minimum the government has to sit following a throne speech and is likely intended to shelter the New Democrats from criticism on how they're handling the province's economy and the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>But NDP Government House Leader Bill Blaikie said other circumstances caused the super-short session. In the past, the government sat for three weeks following a throne speech.</p>
<p>Blaikie said the Association of Manitoba Municipalities annual meeting in Brandon Nov. 23-26 contributed to delaying the new session. He said government ministers and opposition members wanted to attend the conference. Selinger and several ministers are to meet with the AMM board of directors on the last day of the conference. Progressive Conservative leader Hugh McFadyen and Liberal Leader Jon Gerrard are also attending.</p>
<p>Blaikie said the throne speech will partly focus on protecting Manitoba from the recession and the introduction of several bills.</p>
<p>McFadyen said the short session is an indication the NDP has run out of ideas. "Usually that's a sign of the government running out of steam and doesn't have an agenda," he said, adding former Premier Gary Doer would have brought the house back sooner to better manage government affairs.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Jon Gerrard said Selinger didn't take into account something unforeseen happening which could delay the vote to approve the throne speech.</p>
<p>"The throne speech is a serious presentation of where government is going and I don't think he's given enough time," Gerrard said.</p>
<p>McFadyen also said the province should look again at fixed dates for when MLAs sit. Under rules introduced in 2005, the house must sit once each year but there is no minimum number of days required.</p>
<p>The federal government and many provincial governments, including British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario, have fixed calendars.</p>
<p>bruce.owen@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>How we stand</p>
<p>On average, the Manitoba legislature has sat 66 days per year since 2000 -- that is 10 fewer than the average number of sitting days from 1995 to 1999, the year the NDP came to power.</p>

</p>
<p>There is much talk these days about the need to practise “evidence-based medicine.”</p>
<p>That may seem self-evident – after all, if medical practice is not based on evidence then what is it based on: Intuition? Tradition? Politics? Emotion? Wishful thinking? Pecuniary gain?</p>
<p>Sadly, too often the answer to those questions is: “Yes.”</p>
<p>Let's take a current, politically charged, emotionally laden issue as an example: mammography.</p>
<p>This week, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued new recommendations on how mammography should be used to screen women for breast cancer. The blue-ribbon panel of experts said:</p>
<p>• Women aged 50-74 should get mammograms every two years.</p>
<p>• Mammograms are not recommended for women under 50 or for those 75 and older.</p>
<p>• There is no additional benefit to be gained from clinical breast examination in women who undergo mammography.</p>
<p>• There is no evidence that breast self-examination is useful.</p>
<p>• There is no additional benefit gained from screening using digital mammography or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), instead of traditional film X-ray mammography</p>
<p>(The recommendations apply to the general population, not to those at high risk because of a family history of breast cancer or who have tested positive for the breast cancer genes BRCA1 or BRCA2.)</p>
<p>Predictably, the USPSTF recommendations have caused an uproar, one that has spilled across the border, even though they mirror long-standing policies in most Canadian provinces.</p>
<p>Until now, U.S. health authorities have promoted annual mammography from age 40 and embraced ever-more expensive high-tech methods. In the United States, mammography is a big, profitable business.</p>
<p>The assumption, of course, is that earlier screening is better and that the newer the technology, the better. If only it were so simple.</p>
<p>Cancer screening, and breast-cancer screening in particular, has become a religion.</p>
<p>So the response to the USPSTF recommendations – which essentially challenge the current faith-based approach – has been zealous.</p>
<p>There are assertions that implementing these recommendations will deny women essential health-care services, rob young women of the opportunity of early detection and lead to thousands of needless deaths.</p>
<p>According to the USPSTF recommendations, published in the current issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine, that is not what the evidence tells us.</p>
<p>In fact, what the data say about the benefits of mammography is humbling.</p>
<p>USPSTF statistics indicate that in women aged 40 to 49, screening results in a relative risk reduction of 15 per cent; in women 50-59, it is 14 per cent; in those 60-69, 32 per cent and in women over 70, 12 per cent. There is little evidence of reduction in death in women over 75.</p>
<p>Even a cursory glance at those numbers will have people saying: Hold on, mammography actually benefits the 40-49 age group more than the 50-59 group.</p>
<p>That is true, relatively speaking, except for a key consideration – the risk of breast cancer increases with age.</p>
<p>In women under 50, it is 1 in 69; in those 50-59, 1 in 42; and in the 60-69 group, 1 in 29.</p>
<p>If you take a low risk and make it relatively smaller – which is what you do with mammography beginning at 40 – it doesn't save many lives.</p>
<p>To better understand, let's look at the numbers in a different way – the number needed to screen to reduce mortality.</p>
<p>Mammography programs would have to screen 1,904 women aged 39-49 for a decade to prevent a single death; in women aged 50-59, they would need to screen 1,339 for 10 years to prevent one death; and in women 60-69, for every 377 screened for a decade one death will be averted.</p>
<p>We cannot ignore, either, that screening not only has benefits, it can cause harm. Younger, premenopausal women have denser breasts and they have far more false-positive results, leading to unnecessary biopsies that are physically painful and psychologically damaging, not to mention the additional exposure to radiation.</p>
<p>Clearly, according to the evidence, the greatest benefit comes from screening women in the vulnerable 60-69 age group, followed by those in the 50-59 group. Screening those aged 40-49 entails tremendous expense with a modest return.</p>
<p>Naturally, consumer groups, many treating physicians and patients (particularly those whose breast cancer was detected before age 50) are outraged by this heartless analysis.</p>
<p>But there are many conflicting demands for scarce health-care doctors, so rational choices are required, no matter how politically unpopular.</p>
<p>Mass screening programs should not be determined by anecdote and wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Health-care decisions, personal and collective, should be based on evidence, regardless of how displeasing that evidence may be.</p>
<p>Erratum</p>
<p>Last week's column about the need to vaccinate seniors against H1N1 was supposed to include the sentence: “As proud veterans – so many of them now frail and elderly – stood yesterday in Remembrance Day ceremonies, one could not but be awed by their sacrifice and their stoicism.” But the word “but” was omitted, making me look like, well, a butt. My apologies.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>SCREENING PROGRAMS</p>
<p>A new report from the U.S.</p>
<p>Preventive Services Task Force recommends that mammography to screen for breast cancer be done every two years for women aged 50-74. Many consumer groups are outraged by the recommendation, saying lives can be saved with annual screening programs that begin at age 40.</p>
<p>The Canadian Cancer Society endorses screening mammography for women aged 50-69 but each province has different criteria.</p>
<p>This list provides the age of eligibility and access for each of the provincial and territorial mammography screening programs.</p>

<p>Re: Liberals Immune To Flu Facts, Don Martin, Nov. 17.</p>
<p>Don Martin wrongly attributes several points to Liberal "spin" when they are backed up by fact and in the public record. He said it was false to warn that "the immunization completion date will be delayed by several months and could extend into February." Last week, however, the Minister of Health said the vaccine campaign would "be complete in eight to 12 weeks," and at least one province, Nova Scotia, cited February as its probable vaccination completion date.</p>
<p>Mr. Martin also writes that "the Liberals also seem to be boosting flu figures for dramatic effect by saying there have been at least 41 deaths in the past week and 190 deaths in total."</p>
<p>In fact, Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, on Nov. 17 confirmed that 198 Canadians have died from H1N1, while a report in another newspaper accounted for at least 41 deaths over the span of a week.</p>
<p>Finally, Mr. Martin states that "if H1N1 has 'overwhelmed many hospital ICUs,' as the Liberals allege, that's news to the media."</p>
<p>He must not have read a recent Edmonton Journal report that said H1N1 cases are filling one-quarter to one-third of all ICU beds in Alberta hospitals.</p>

<p>Re: An Injection Of Reason About H1N1, Joe Schwarcz, Nov. 17.</p>
<p>Joe Schwarcz is yet another academic telling Canadians to shut up and swallow their medicine. He reminds us that "various graduates of the University of <span class="companylink">Google</span>" are not educated enough to say whether we should be vaccinated and that we should listen only to the experts at theWorldHealthOrganization, theCentersforDiseaseCon-t r o l and, of course, Health Canada.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is the reams of conflicting information coming from those same sources and other public health professionals. For example, Dr. Richard Schabas, former chief medical officer of Ontario, recently told the media that the "dire warnings" about H1N1 were unwarranted and that the vaccination program is too late in the flu season to be of much use. Mr. Schwarcz himself adds to the confusing milieu of information by telling us not to panic and that H1N1 is just another mild flu that will make our lives miserable "for a week or so."</p>

</p>
<p>With warnings that a third wave of the H1N1 flu outbreak is expected, health authorities across the country are starting to announce that anyone who wants the H1N1 flu shot will be able to get one.</p>
<p>The general release of the swine flu vaccine starts today for anyone living in Ontario or Winnipeg. Priority group lists have been eliminated as officials say they are confident there is ample vaccine on hand.</p>
<p>Alberta announced yesterday that vaccination clinics there are expected to be open to all early next week.</p>
<p>Starting today in Alberta, clinics will vaccinate any child 18 and under and their parents.</p>
<p>Tighter restrictions remain in place in B.C. (see information box below on Vancouver Island clinics), but health officials here are expected to decide within a day or two whether to offer shots to everyone in the province who wants one.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, B.C.'s provincial health officer says the Vancouver Canucks jumped the queue when the players and the team's support staff were given the H1N1 vaccine this week.</p>
<p>"They were out of sequence," Dr. Perry Kendall said in a phone interview yesterday.</p>
<p>But Canucks general manager Mike Gillis said the team believed federal health officials had announced on Friday that doses of the H1N1 vaccine were now approved for general use and no longer limited to specific groups.</p>
<p>In fact, eligibility for flu shots is determined by provincial health officials.</p>
<p>Most of the Canucks players, coaching staff and some support staff members received the vaccine on Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>Kendall said they should not have received the shots, because they don't meet the existing criteria.</p>
<p>Kendall said he is surprised the Canucks would not have waited a few more days as the vaccine is expected to be made available to everyone in B.C., possibly as soon as the end of this week.</p>
<p>VANCOUVER ISLAND FLU-SHOT CLINICS</p>

<p>Personal H1N1 pandemic kits don't cost a lot at the Saskatchewan Abilities Council, but assembling them is a priceless opportunity for those with disabilities.</p>
<p>Each single-use pandemic kit costs $5 -- cheaper if bought in bulk. The kit includes a sanitizing wipe, a hand sanitizer pouch, a N95 mask with instructions on fitting it as well as nitrile gloves, which are powder- and latex-free.</p>
<p>People with intellectual disabilities assemble the kits in a Javex-cleaned room in Regina. Everyone washes and sanitizes their hands before they package the items, said Lori-Lynn Nelson, the senior supervisor of industrial assembly.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to have people work on their vocational skills so they can work in the community at minimum wage or better," Nelson said.</p>
<p>"We're trying to get people to learn some real job skills so we try to keep our products reasonably priced," said Karen Moore, regional director of the Regina branch of the abilities council. "We can customize any kind of pandemic kit that customers want, so if they wanted 20 individual hand sanitizers in a pouch, we can do that. We adjust the cost according to what the customer wants."</p>
<p>The goal behind producing the kits isn't about profit margins, but helping clients profit by doing meaningful jobs to prepare them to work in the community, Moore said.</p>
<p>"What we do in the industrial commercial operations here is we earn some revenue to be able to drive it back into programs for people with disabilities," she said.</p>
<p>Anticipating the second wave of the H1N1 virus would hit in the fall, the abilities council began looking for flu products in the spring, but it's been challenging finding stock.</p>
<p>"We've had to do some real creative researching on the web," Moore said. "We'd have a supplier lined up for 20,000 pieces and a firm date of delivery and then we'd get a phone call saying the shipment would be delayed six weeks because the need for pandemic supplies was so high. That's been a frustration for us, but we've got some good suppliers now."</p>
<p>Since production began in the summer, the kits have been popular -- particularly among out-of-country travellers.</p>
<p>"Lots of companies have been buying them," Moore said. "We've sold thousands to the Crown corporations. Crowns are big supporters of us and they have a mandate to try and purchase in Saskatchewan."</p>

</p>
<p>I am in shock after reading Windsor Regional Hospital's CEO David Musyj's guest column, Time to address wages, Nov. 14.</p>
<p>While I can understand his argument and position trying to balance the budget at Windsor Regional Hospital, in my opinion, I find his approach inequitable and demoralizing to his nursing staff.</p>
<p>He quotes the average nurses salary as $76,195, yet fails to mention his salary was quoted in the Sunshine List as earning $210,186, and that was his wage before he took on the top job at Windsor Regional Hospital. What is his current salary? Do those top CEO spots really deserve 176 per cent more than front-line nursing staff? Maybe there should be a cap as to what hospital administrators are paid across the province.</p>
<p>The nurses working at Windsor Regional Hospital care for our families 24/7. They monitor and report vital information to doctors 24/7. They work all shifts, put themselves and their families at risk for getting infections such as SARS and H1N1, and they are administering medication that could kill you if they didn't have their education. I am appalled that this is the way that Mr. Musyj has decided to thank them.</p>
<p>I believe that if Mr. Musyj really wants to balance the budget, he can start at the top and drastically reduce top administrators' wages at the hospital.</p>

</p>
<p>We don't know exactly when the general public will start getting its shot at the H1N1 vaccine, but the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region has two main clinic sites in its sights.</p>
<p>"When the mass vaccination begins, we're looking at two primary locations in the city," said region spokesman Mark Torjusen.</p>
<p>"We'll be having locations in the inner city, but those will be aimed at residents of those areas.</p>
<p>"We'll be letting those people know on a local level. We'll also be doing immunizations at the University of Regina."</p>
<p>H1N1 vaccinations will continue at the former Robert Usher Collegiate, 1440 9th Ave. N.</p>
<p>Torjusen provided some basic tips to speed up the vaccination process.</p>
<p>"You can download the forms that you have to fill out prior to getting the vaccine," he said. "If you have those filled out when you come, that shortens your time getting through.</p>
<p>"Make sure you have your health card and dress so that our public health nurses can get access to the upper part of your shoulder because that's where vaccine goes in."</p>
<p>The pandemic H1N1 influenza immunization information screening and consent form can be downloaded from the region's website: www.rqhealth.ca[http://www.rqhealth.ca].</p>
<p>However, Torjusen stressed that mass vaccinations have not yet started and residents should check the region's website to ensure they are eligible to be immunized before heading off to Usher Collegiate.</p>
<p>This week, the Ministry of Health expanded the groups eligible for H1N1 flu vaccinations to include students up to Grade 12 and people of all ages with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Also eligible are health workers, children from six months old to Grade 12, people of all ages who are immune-compromised or have underlying health conditions, pregnant women and women who have given birth in the past four weeks.</p>
<p>Depending on the supply of vaccine the province gets on Monday, health officials hope that mass immunizations could start by the end of next week.</p>

<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>Ontario will make the H1N1 vaccine available for the general public by the end of this week, Premier Dalton McGuinty announced this morning.</p>
<p>In a tacit acknowledgment that the rollout of the vaccination program got off to a bumpy start, with many residents facing long lineups at public clinics, he thanked Ontarians for being patient and for waiting their turn while those most at risk of developing complications got their flu shots first.</p>
<p>“I also want to thank everybody involved in our public health delivery system,” Mr. McGuinty told reporters. “This presented them with a huge challenge, the biggest vaccination program of its kind anywhere in our history. I think they performed remarkably well under the circumstances.”</p>
<p>Toronto and surrounding regions made the vaccine available to all comers earlier this week. Mr. McGuinty said he hopes to get the flu shot this week.</p>

</p>
<p>(From National Post, November 20, 2009) Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer, visited a Toronto H1N1 flu clinic on Tuesday. An incorrect name appeared in Wednesday's paper.****** </p>
<p>Darlene King, the province's chief medical officer, braved the virus-riddled streets of Toronto yesterday to visit with prioritized Ontarians waiting at the North Toronto Memorial Community Centre. The Post's Matthew Coutts went to watch:</p>
<p>2:20 p.m. The meet and greet is already beginning to seem like any other officious public appearance. Reporters are ushered to a room and will be escorted into the "flu zone" to witness a family get the shot when the time is right. The flu zone, by the way, is the room where nurses administer the vaccination and does not, as one might expect, have anything in common with a subway station.</p>
<p>2:24 A provincial organizer and a municipal media co-ordinator come face to face and, for a moment, I expect a West Side Story-esque territorial gang fight to break out, finger snapping and all. It is not to be.</p>
<p>2:36 I see a sign that reads, "Media are not permitted in the vaccination areas due to safety and confidentiality issues." Whose safety? I'm harmless.</p>
<p>2:40 We are told we will witness Ana Sanchez and her five-year-old son, Brian, get shots. "Is Ana in a priority group?" someone asks. "I can only assume so, because she is getting the shot." I have a sudden desire to reread Catch 22.</p>
<p>2:41 We are ushered into the auditorium -- sorry, flu zone -- through a back entrance. There are more than 20 needle stations ready to go and only about eight people there for the shot. Perhaps it's time to go city-wide with this thing?</p>
<p>2:42 Young Brian is sitting next to a nurse, and he's already crying in anticipation of the needle. Brian puts on a brave face, smiling as his new reporter friends encircle him to witnesses his pain. He's clutching three lollipops, doing us the courtesy of counting them out.</p>
<p>2:43 Male nurse Donald Corbiere jabs Brian in the arm with a thin syringe, and the kindergarten student's face scrunches like he's eating lemons. "That's it?" he says, eyes suddenly bright. "I did it?" We collectively fawn over his bravery.</p>
<p>2:44 I ask if Brian knows why he got a needle. "So I don't get swine flu," he says. And if he got H1N1? "I would die."</p>
<p>2:47 Dr. Kinggivesstrong, deliberate handshakes to Brian, Ana and father Portfirio. I'm starting to marvel at the traditional handshake's ability to survive swine flu hysteria.</p>
<p>2:49 During a pause in the action, a reporter chats amicably with a nurse at a nearby station, until she is told to stop by an organizer and reprimanded. No interaction with anyone who didn't sign a waiver form.</p>
<p>2:50 Ana confirms she is in a priority group: She has breast cancer and chemotherapy has weakened her immune system. But the reason she came down today was Brian. "I don't want him to get sick," she tells me.</p>
<p>3:08 Exiting the centre, I discover to ultimate flu prevention method: a man standing at the door exclusively designated to press the automatic open button for me. My hands remain untarnished.</p>
<p>3:11 Arriving at the Eglinton subway station, I curse my lack of personal assistant and touch the soiled door handle. Dreaming of a healthier time, I descend into the flu zone.</p>

<p>NEW YORK</p>
<p>Basketball</p>
<p>Knicks eyeing Iverson</p>
<p>NEW YORK - The New York Knicks passed on a chance to sign Allen Iverson over the summer. A few months and only one victory later, they have to decide if he's worth reconsidering. Iverson will soon be on the market again after the Memphis Grizzlies announced they were parting ways with the former scoring champion. And while the Knicks weren't interested in the off-season, they won't rule him out yet. Coach Mike D'Antoni and team president Donnie Walsh both praise Iverson's abilities, but say the organization still has to discuss whether it is worth bringing him to a 1-9 team that is off to the worst 10-game start in franchise history.</p>
<p>High school volleyball</p>
<p>Highlanders clinch title</p>
<p>KITCHENER - The Sir John A. Macdonald Highlanders scored a 3-1 win over the WCI Vikings in the Waterloo County senior boys volleyball league championship game at WCI on Tuesday night. The Highlanders won 36-34, 25-16, 18-25, 25-19 to clinch the title. Both teams will return to action on Thursday when they take part in the Central Western Ontario quad-A tournament at the University of Waterloo. The St. Mary's Eagles are in as the District 8 representatives. The final of that tournament will be played at Grand River. The Forest Heights Trojans scored a 3-1 (25-15, 16-25, 25-16, 25-18) win over the Grand River Renegades in the junior final. Both teams advance to the CWOSSA quad-A tournament set for Thursday at Grand River.</p>
<p>NFL</p>
<p>Chiefs' Bow suspended</p>
<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. - Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Dwayne Bowe has been suspended for four games for violating the NFL's policy against performance-enhancing substances. The team announced the suspension Tuesday and said it would have no further comment. Bowe's agent, Todd France, did not immediately return a message left seeking comment. Bowe has been a bright spot in an otherwise dismal season for the Chiefs (2-7).</p>
<p>H1N1</p>
<p>Province drops investigation</p>
<p>TORONTO - Team owners say the only members of the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs and the NBA's Toronto Raptors to get the H1N1 flu shots were in the priority groups. Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews says she'll take the teams at their word for now. Matthews says everyone has heard stories about people jumping the queue and getting a vaccine before people in the priority groups.</p>
<p>CFL</p>
<p>Ottawa closes to getting team</p>
<p>OTTAWA - The CFL is one step closer to returning to the nation's capital. Ottawa city council voted 15-9 on Monday to move forward with a proposal to develop Lansdowne Park. The plan includes a remodelled outdoor stadium at the site. The CFL has awarded a conditional expansion franchise to a group led by Ottawa 67's owner Jeff Hunt, which is contingent on the plan's approval. The city and Hunt's Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group, who are now partners in the project, still have to satisfy five conditions before another vote next May.</p>

<p>Stories Report on Business is following today:</p>
<p>Gold hits fresh high</p>
<p>Investors continue to pile into gold, pushing bullion ever higher. Gold topped $1,150 (U.S.) an ounce this morning, continuing its recent climb. Bullion’s ascent has been driven by a weak U.S. dollar and, analysts say, the push through key levels. Gold also acts as a safe haven investment in uncertain times. “It is attracting new speculative capital,” one analyst told Reuters. Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/gold-climbs-past-1150/article1367630/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/gold-climbs-past-1150/article1367630/])</p>
<p>Not too hot, not too cold</p>
<p>The effective bottom line from this morning's Statistics Canada report on consumer prices in October: No one need worry about either deflation or inflation. Month over month, consumer prices fell 0.1 per cent in October, but on an annual basis the inflation rate is now 0.1 per cent. It's the first annual increase since May, which means there is no threat of deflation at this point. Core inflation, which factors out volatile items, came in at 1.8 per cent. On a monthly basis, the costs of shelter, clothing, alcohol and tobacco rose, while prices for health and personal products, recreation and food fell. Transportation costs were also lower on the month, pushed down by lower gasoline prices. There's nothing in the report that would knock the Bank of Canada off its current course of low interest rates.

<p>Debt concerns mount</p>
<p>Concern continues to mount over surging government debt levels. In Beijing today, U.S. President Barack Obama went so far as to warn that too much debt could push the United States into a double-dip recession. Mr. Obama told Fox News in an interview that he faces a juggling act, trying to keep debt in line while still acting to juice the economy. He said the government is looking at measures that would boost growth, among them the possibility of tax incentives that would prompt companies to hire. "It is important, though, to recognize if we keep on adding to debt, even in the midst of this recovery, that at some point, people could lose confidence in the U.S. economy in a way that could actually lead to a double-dip recession," Mr. Obama said. Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/crash-and-recovery/obama-warns-of-double-dip-slump/article1367635/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/crash-and-recovery/obama-warns-of-double-dip-slump/article1367635/])</p>
<p>In London today, the British government opened the legislative session promising to hold the budget deficit in check. Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government is looking at legislation that would force the Treasury to slash the deficit by half over four years. Also on tap is a bill that would limit bankers' bonuses. Britain's deficit is on track to hit 12.4 per cent of gross domestic product. "We were dealing with a financial crisis that if we hadn't acted when we did could have turned into a human disaster," said Business Secretary Peter Mandelson, according to reports from Bloomberg News. "What we're locking in is a commitment and strong discipline for this and future governments that they will act in a fiscally responsible way, that we will rebalance the public finances over the medium term."</p>
<p>And in Tokyo, the OECD's secretary general, Angel Gurria, expressed worries over Japan's massive debt, warning that its deficit is near 10 per cent of GDP. "Any small increase in the nominal level of rates [of public debt to GDP] will be extremely difficult to handle in the budgets," Mr. Gurria said, according to the Reuters news agency.</p>
<p>New home construction drops in U.S.</p>
<p>New home construction in the United States fell sharply in October, but economists said home builders were basically waiting see whether a popular tax credit would be extended. The U.S. Commerce Department said today construction of new homes fell 10.6 per cent last month, well below what economists had expected. The tax credit - up to $8,000 (U.S.) for first-time buyers, had been set to expire at the end of this month, but it is now being extended and expanded. Said BMO Nesbitt Burns: "There will still be people buying homes, either for the first time or moving moving up, thanks to the extended and expanded government tax credit ? It will take a while before residential construction begins to contribute meaningfully to growth."</p>
<p>Cosmos takes another run at Cossette</p>
<p>It turns out the fight for Cossette Inc. wasn't over after all. Many observers had believed that U.S. private equity firm Mill Road Capital had basically won the Canadian ad agency with an offer earlier this month, outbidding Cosmos Capital. But Cosmos came back late yesterday for its third run at the agency, valuing the company at $131.5-million.

<p>Madoff auction raises more than expected</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshals Service has collected almost $3-million (U.S.) by auctioning off some of the personal belongings of Bernard Madoff and his wife Ruth over the course of about a week, more than expected, according to Bloomberg News today. There are still more sales to come, all of which will raise money for the victims of the massive Ponzi scheme for which Mr. Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence. Among the items sold were Ms. Madoff’s diamond earrings, Mr. Madoff’s Mets sports jacket and three powerboats.</p>

<p>Shareholders of Cadbury PLC are positively salivating over the prospect of a bidding war for the well known British candy maker. Hershey Co. and Italy's Ferrero International SA confirm they are considering a joint bid for Cadbury, which would rival advances from U.S. food giant Kraft Foods Inc. Cadbury has already rejected Kraft's bid. Hershey and Ferrero say they're in the early stages of evaluating options, enough to push Cadbury's share price higher.

<p>Metro posts strong quarter</p>
<p>Recession or no, people have to eat. Couple with that the fact that Metro Inc. (MRU.A) has also been working on merchandising efforts and overhauling its Ontario operations, pushing the Montreal-based company to a third-quarter profit of $84.4-million or 77 cents a year, up from last year's $72.5-million or 65 cents. Revenue rose to $2.53-billion from $2.47-billion as same-store sales, a key measure, rose 2 per cent. "We are proud to have posted record net earnings in every quarter of fiscal 2009," chief executive officer Eric La Fleche boasted in a statement. "? Despite the challenging economic environment, we are confident that we will continue to grow in the coming year."</p>

<p>British business moves to support Tories</p>
<p>British businesses are adding heft to the Tory bid to defeat Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s Labour in the election next year. There are some interesting types involved. You’d expect accounts, management consultants and the like to support the Conservatives. Bloomberg News reports today that Britain’s renowned custom tailors are also jumping on board. Crombie Concessions Ltd., a well known suit tailor, gave £19,000 in staff time in the second quarter, while Bain & Co. Holdings Ltd. donated a consultant.</p>
<p>You better not cough, I'm telling you why</p>
<p>Many of America's Santa Clauses want priority for the H1N1 flu shot. The Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas held a seminar on the flu recently in Philadelphia, while the president of a separate group known as Santa America asked his congressman last week to designate Santas a priority group, The Associated Press reports. The news service notes that it's not just because flu-infected children may climb onto Santa's lap, but also because of research that suggests obesity can be a risk factor. Santa America president Ernest Berger, who represents about 200 volunteer Santas, asked Alabama Rep. Jo Bonner for the priority designation, and wants both Santas and children to use hand sanitizer. “It's a delicate balance here,” he told the news agency. “This is not an exercise in health care. This is visiting Santa.”</p>

<p>In London, Britain's Labour government promised today to halve its huge budget deficit and curb bankers' pay in the hope of reviving its popularity before a national election next year. The opposition Conservatives are on course to win an election due by June, ending Labour's grip on power since 1997. An enduring recession, a politicians' expenses scandal and anger about the war in Afghanistan have eroded support for Prime Minister Gordon Brown's government. The government will enshrine in law its plans to cut the deficit in half over four years, but financial markets will have to wait until the pre-budget report on Dec. 9 for more details. The budget deficit is set to exceed 12 per cent of gross domestic product this year, raising concerns on markets about the future management of public finances. Another law will allow a more powerful Financial Services Authority watchdog to tear up bankers' contracts if they are deemed excessive and will require financial firms to set out living wills to wind themselves down in a future crisis.

<p>Manulife in big stock sale</p>
<p>Manulife Financial Corp. launched a $2.5-billion stock sale late today as the life insurer moves to build what chief executive officer Donald Guloien described as ‘fortress levels of capital.” Canada’s largest insurer rolled out its second massive equity offering of the past 12 months - it sold $2.275-billion of stock last December - as Mr. Guloien attempted to shore up a balance sheet weighed down by exposure to the drop in equity markets. The financing shows financial services companies are still concerned with the future of stock markets and the economy, despite the rally in equities that has played out since March. A syndicate of underwriters agreed to buy the Manulife common shares at a price of $19.00 each, a 6-per-cent discount to its $20.18 closing price today.</p>
<p>Bombardier in talks for major deal</p>
<p>Bombardier Inc. is in exclusive talks with French rail giant SNCF for a major contract, potentially worth up to $12.6-billion, to build a new fleet of suburban and regional trains. Locking up exclusive negotiations with SNCF is a huge win for Bombardier against its French arch rival, Alstom. It also compensates for last month's loss of a separate contract, to build 100 train sets for SNCF, to Alstom. The initial contract would be for 80 train sets valued at about $1.5-billion. But if all options were exercised, the contract could be extended to an order for 860 train sets in the $12.6-billion range. The SNCF deal would also help offset Bombardier's slumping aerospace unit, which makes commercial and business jets and has been hit hard by the global recession. “This is good news for Canadians, and for Quebeckers in particular,” SNCF spokesman François Remy said in an interview. “The choice was between Alstom and Bombardier.”</p>
<p>Telus sues Rogers over ads</p>
<p>Telus Communications Inc. has launched legal action against Rogers Communications Inc. , claiming its advertisements boasting of Canada's fastest and most reliable network are false and misleading. In documents filed in B.C.'s supreme court, Telus said that since a Nov. 5 upgrade, a network run by Bell and Telus offers faster and more reliable service than the Rogers network. Telus says Rogers ads introduced in 2007 and continuing after Nov. 5 that claim Rogers provides “Canada's fastest network: two times faster than any other,” are now false and misleading. Telus is seeking a declaration from Rogers that its ads breached Canada's Competition Act, as well as an injunction from distributing the ads, damages and compensation. “We stand behind our claims,” Rogers said in a statement. “All of our internal and third party external testing since 2007 has consistently demonstrated that we have the most reliable network. We’ve established our reliability over time with millions of customers on our network. Telus has not submitted any data on their network performance. We look forward to vigorously defending our position in court.”</p>

<p>Kraft still seen as front-runner in Cadbury race</p>
<p>Italy's Ferrero and U.S.-based Hershey Co. are considering a bid for chocolatier Cadbury PLC, but hostile bidder Kraft Foods Inc. is still seen as the front-runner with its $16.8-billion (U.S.) offer. Hershey and family-owned Ferrero, the maker of Nutella chocolate spread, both said separately today they were reviewing a possible bid but gave no assurance that they would make a proposal for the British confectioner. Cadbury said it would give proper consideration to “any serious offer that delivers full value for the company,” but stressed it has yet to receive such a bid. Cadbury has dismissed Kraft's offer as “derisory.” The Ferrero and Hershey statements gave no hint that they might be working together on a joint bid. Analysts and investors doubt the two could rival the hostile cash-and-share offer from Kraft, though Cadbury could use interest from Hershey and Ferrero to extract a higher bid from Kraft.

<p>RIM official warns of ‘rogue' smart phones</p>
<p>Research In Motion Ltd.'s security chief warns that hackers could one day turn ordinary smart phones into “rogue” devices to attack major wireless networks. Scott Totzke, RIM's vice-president of BlackBerry security, said hackers could use smart phones to target wireless carriers using a technique similar to one used in assaults that slowed Internet traffic in the United States and South Korea in July. In what is known as a distributed denial of service, or a DDOS attack, criminals use phone signals to order tens of thousands computers to contact a targeted site repeatedly, slowing it or eventually crashing it. Mr. Totzke said a technique involving data packets might be used to bring down a wireless network, though hackers might accomplish that using a relatively small number of smart phones. “I think that's an area of concern,” he said in an interview.

<p>Metro posts strong quarter</p>
<p>Recession or no, people have to eat. Couple with that is the fact that Metro Inc. has also been working on merchandising efforts and overhauling its Ontario operations, pushing the Montreal-based company to a third-quarter profit of $84.4-million or 77 cents a year, up from last year's $72.5-million or 65 cents. Revenue rose to $2.53-billion from $2.47-billion as same-store sales, a key measure, rose 2 per cent. "We are proud to have posted record net earnings in every quarter of fiscal 2009," chief executive officer Eric La Fleche boasted in a statement. "? Despite the challenging economic environment, we are confident that we will continue to grow in the coming year."</p>
<p>Madoff auction raises more than expected</p>
<p>The U.S. Marshals Service has collected almost $3-million (U.S.) by auctioning off some of the personal belongings of Bernard Madoff and his wife, Ruth, over the course of about a week, more than expected, according to Bloomberg News today. There are still more sales to come, all of which will raise money for the victims of the massive Ponzi scheme for which Mr. Madoff is serving a 150-year sentence. Among the items sold were Ms. Madoff's diamond earrings, Mr. Madoff's Mets sports jacket and three powerboats.</p>

<p>Many of America's Santa Clauses want priority for the H1N1 flu shot. The Amalgamated Order of Real Bearded Santas held a seminar on the flu recently in Philadelphia, while the president of a separate group known as Santa America asked his congressman last week to designate Santas a priority group, The Associated Press reports. The news service notes that it's not simply because flu-infected children may climb onto Santa's lap, but also because of research that suggests obesity can be a risk factor. Santa America president Ernest Berger, who represents about 200 volunteer Santas, asked Alabama Rep. Jo Bonner for the priority designation, and wants both Santas and children to use hand sanitizer. “It's a delicate balance here,” he told the news agency. “This is not an exercise in health care. This is visiting Santa.”</p>

<p><span class="companylink">Mexicana Airlines</span> is dropping its non-stop service between Edmonton and Mexico City in January, and adding an extra flight from Calgary.</p>
<p>The global economic downturn, and travel restrictions imposed on Mexican nationals due to the H1N1 crisis forced the airline to make difficult decisions to stay afloat, said Jorge Goytortua, Mexicana's regional vice-president for North America.</p>
<p>"In spite of today's difficult environment, we are committed to the Canadian market and believe this situation will change in the short term, allowing us to reconsider new destinations serving Canadian travellers."</p>
<p>The three-flights-a-week Edmonton service was launched in June 2008 and built on the success of charters between the two cities.</p>
<p>Edmonton Airports spokeswoman Tracy Bednard said it was disappointing the service didn't work as well as expected, but people who used Mexico City as a gateway to other destinations should look at Continental's Houston service which began earlier this month.</p>
<p>"They have an extensive route system that serves many of the same markets.</p>
<p>"We certainly hope to see Mexicana back at some point."</p>

<p>I am so upset regarding the H1N1 flu clinic for seniors.</p>
<p>Tuesday morning my husband and I (we're in our 80s) went to the Northgate clinic and to our dismay found that we must line up with people of all ages, including young moms with babies.</p>
<p>Last week the clinic was very age specific, ID required, and all others would be turned away. When it's our turn (75 and up) we don't get that privilege. Some of those dear, old souls bent over their walkers and canes should not be required to stand there for two hours or more--the estimated waiting time. We didn't stay.</p>
<p>What's wrong with this picture?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health workforce pared back; Provincial deficit expected to fall $2.5B even as cuts announced</b>
</div><div>Trish Audette And Archie Mclean   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>556 words</div><div>18 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta's projected deficit is expected to fall by nearly a third when new numbers are announced later this month, but that won't stop health cuts.</p>
<p>Government sources say the deficit will be about $4.4 billion, $2.5 billion less than estimated at the end of the summer when falling natural gas prices hit provincial coffers hard.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach, speaking on an Edmonton radio talk show Tuesday night, said he was "optimistic based on our previous experiences. By the time we end our fiscal yearend (on) March 31, we'll be very, very close to our original budget estimates."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Alberta Health Services confirmed it still plans to slash 1,200 administrative positions in a bid to cut in half its $1.3-billion projected deficit.</p>
<p>The move is part of a broad plan to save $660 million by the end of the fiscal year, March 31.</p>
<p>AHS also plans to contract out security services in hospitals. The move could leave about 100 people without jobs.</p>
<p>"We have some savings attributed to protective services. There may be an impact on staff," said Mike Conroy, the health board's executive vice-president of corporate services.</p>
<p>He could not say how much money will be saved by moving security services to a contractor, but expects about half of 200 security workers to find jobs with the new contractor.</p>
<p>Hospital security staff fall under the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, which has not joined the health board's new voluntary retirement program.</p>
<p>The United Nurses agreed to the program last week; however, Conroy said now is not the time for AHS to discuss letting nurses go voluntarily.</p>
<p>"During the H1N1 pandemic we're not going to be looking in the clinical areas at all," he said.</p>
<p>But the board's chief executive, Stephen Duckett, did not rule out a thinning of clinical staff.</p>
<p>Instead, he pointed out how AHS has managed to save money by standardizing procurement of goods.</p>
<p>"There's more to come," he said. "We've got more to do. We can do more with less by getting the benefits of standardization."</p>
<p>Consolidating jobs can be done, Duckett said, by streamlining payroll departments for example.</p>
<p>But critics worry shrinking the health sector will directly affect Albertans, even if nurses and doctors aren't targeted.</p>
<p>"It's going to add to wait times, it's going to reduce the professional staffing, it's going to add to complications and costs ultimately in the longer term," Liberal Leader Dr. David Swann said.</p>
<p>"We're going to see lives being jeopardized, lives being lost."</p>
<p>While the board will not fill about 660 current vacancies, there is potential for about 550 other positions to be axed.</p>
<p>Two hundred of those potential positions are in the management and exempt staff ranks, 326 fall under the Health Sciences Association of Alberta, and 25 are CUPE members.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>SAVINGS</p>
<p>-Facilities management: $252.1 million</p>
<p>-Procurement savings: $221.6 million</p>
<p>-Administrative restructuring: $61.6 million</p>
<p>-Vacancy management: $66 million</p>
<p>-Management and exempt salary freeze: $47 million</p>
<p>-Revenue generation: $11.2 million</p>
<p>-Total amount saved by the end of the fiscal year: $659.5 million</p>

<p>Nearly a year-and-a-half after launching service from Mexico City to Alberta, <span class="companylink">Mexicana Airlines</span> said it's dropping service to Edmonton but adding an extra flight to Calgary beginning in January.</p>
<p>Mexicana will increase its service to Calgary to five flights per week, as Mexico's largest international airline moves to consolidate its presence in Alberta using YYC as its gateway.</p>
<p>The carrier will suspend its thrice-weekly service to Edmonton on Jan. 15, but it could resume the service down the road, officials said.</p>
<p>The move to consolidate its Alberta presence at YYC came as a result of market research, Mexicana added.</p>
<p>Independent airlines analyst Rick Erickson said the loss of the service to Edmonton is unfortunate, but the simple fact is there are more aviation business attractors in Calgary.</p>
<p>"Once again, this completely underscores the fact that Calgary is unquestionably the leading economic business community on the Prairies; unequivocally," he said.</p>
<p>Jorge Goytortua, Mexicana's regional vice-president, North America, said as a result of the global economic downturn, the H1N1 flu crisis and the restrictions imposed on Mexican nationals travelling to Canada, the airline "had to take a deep look into the bottom line, making difficult decisions in order to maintain the company afloat."</p>
<p>Announced in December 2007, Mexicana commenced flights to Alberta in June last year.</p>
<p>Traci Bednard, spokeswoman for Edmonton Airports, said though disappointed, they look for an opportunity to re-establish the link with Mexicana, which she called a great partner.</p>
<p>Garth Atkinson, president of the <span class="companylink">Calgary Airport Authority</span>, said he's pleased that Mexicana has reaffirmed its commitment to serve YYC and the Alberta marketplace.</p>
<p>"We are confident they will continue to do well using YYC as their international gateway to Alberta."</p>
<p>Mayor Dave Bronconnier said adding more frequency from Calgary to Mexico City means more flexibility and ease for travelling on business, "and more opportunity for Calgarians and others from across the province who are seeking some sun and fun at Mexico's world-famous beaches, resorts and beyond."</p>

<p>I f every Canadian heeds the advice of public health officials to get the H1N1 shot, there will not be enough vaccine available by Christmas as the federal government has been promising, the chief public health officer acknowledged Tuesday.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq have consistently said there will be enough vaccine for every Canadian who needs and wants it by Christmas, but "enough" doesn't mean sufficient supply to cover the entire population.</p>
<p>"We should have enough by the end of the year for close to certainly 60 to 75 per cent of the population," Butler-Jones said in an interview with Canwest News Service. "If 33 million wish to be immunized, then that may take us into January."</p>
<p>While the federal government has ordered more than enough vaccine for the entire population--50.4 million doses--it is basically counting on thousands of Canadians ignoring their advice to be vaccinated when it says there will be enough for everyone by the end of December.</p>
<p>By the end of this week, about 11 million doses will have been distributed by the federal government to the provinces and territories. In a good week, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> should produce about three million doses, but over the last six weeks less than two million doses per week have been shipped from its factory in Ste-Foy, Que. If the best-case scenario of three million doses per week is experienced from here on in, 26 million doses will have been distributed by the week ending Dec. 27.</p>
<p>"It's not enough for every Canadian, but not every Canadian obviously is going to be willing to be immunized or desire to be immunized," said Butler-Jones, although he and other top medical officials have been repeating the message for months that getting the vaccine is the best defence against the flu linked to nearly 200 deaths in Canada since it first appeared in the spring.</p>
<p>In Alberta, 42 people with H1N1 have passed away since the outbreak began. The three latest deaths, which were reported Tuesday, included a middle-aged man and an elderly woman from Edmonton as well as a middle-aged woman from Calgary.</p>
<p>"All three of these individuals had chronic underlying health conditions," said Don Stewart, spokesman for Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>"If every single Canadian wanted to be immunized, that would be a fabulous problem to deal with . . . there won't be 34 million doses before Christmas," said Butler-Jones.</p>

</p>
<p>The federal government, through its spending power, already plays a meaningful role in the health-care field. There is also something called the Canada Health Act, which enshrines certain core principles like comprehensiveness, public administration and portability.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, though, the provinces exercise legislative competence in the area of public health. In a word, provincial governments are jurisdictionally charged with the delivery of health-care services and programs.</p>
<p>That, of course, applies to the rollout of the current H1N1 inoculation program in each province. While the federal government does pay for the lion's share of the flu vaccine itself (some 60 per cent) and deals with vaccine approval and distribution, the actual implementation and protocols for the vaccinations themselves fall within the purview of the provinces.</p>
<p>One political commentator recently wrote that the problems now plaguing the inoculation process rest largely with the nature of federal-provincial relations. As he went on to explain: "Whatever its strengths, Canada's federal system is singularly ill-equipped to manage a pandemic, with federal, provincial and municipal jurisdictions overlapping or leaving cracks for things to fall through."</p>
<p>It's true that the provinces have quietly complained about a lack of federal consultations and updates, vaccine shortages and uncertainties, and mixed messages and a lacklustre communications strategy. The federal government, on the other hand, has maintained that it has distributed more than enough vaccine doses to the provinces. It's up to them, say the feds, to handle the logistical side of things. An argument could be made, though, that leadership on the flu pandemic should rest mostly with the federal government -- while obviously utilizing provincial infrastructure. To be sure, there is a need for federal oversight, national standards and procedures, and overarching national accountability.</p>
<p>This, in turn, would serve to avoid what we essentially have today -- namely, a patchwork of provincial, municipal and even regional inoculation regimes. There is precious little in the way of consistency or uniformity in terms of rolling out the vaccine from one coast to the other.</p>
<p>There is no doubting that the provinces would be apoplectic at the thought of the federal government playing a leading role on this file. But this is an issue of national or country-wide significance. After all, when peoples' lives are at stake, this needs to be seen in the context of a national emergency or crisis.</p>
<p>Of course, if the federal government were to move to exercise jurisdictional control over the pandemic response, provincial governments would likely fight this in the courts. They would argue, and with good reason, that health care is constitutionally demarcated as a provincial responsibility. The federal government, however, would not be without its own legal firepower. It could base much of its case on the urgency of a national emergency and the Canadian Constitution itself.</p>
<p>As it has done in the past, the federal government could invoke the "peace, order and good government" (POGG) clause of the Constitution to bulletproof its argument. Let's remember that the federal government has previously used the POGG clause to ensure its central role in the regulation of liquor, national control of aeronautics and atomic energy, and control of off-shore resources.</p>
<p>Could anyone dismiss the federal government's claim that it was acting for the general welfare of the country?</p>
<p>We are now seeing what happens to this country when a weakened federal government is confronted with a deadly flu pandemic. Put another way, stronger provinces do not necessarily ensure a focused, purposeful and comprehensive response in time of national crisis.</p>
<p>Over the last 25 years or so, there has been a slow, yet noticeable, shift in power away from the centre and toward the provinces. It's time for national political leadership to reassert itself and to swing the federal-provincial pendulum back toward the central government.</p>
<p>One means of achieving that goal would be for the federal government to stake out its turf on public health during a national pandemic. This could also have the ancillary benefit of fortifying the unity of the country.</p>
<p>Clearly, a pandemic is one of those issues that should not be handcuffed by federalism and jurisdictional squabbling. For this reason, the feds should take charge of this file and demonstrate much-needed leadership in these extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that there should not be different inoculation rollout programs right across the country. This is one of those rare occasions in a federation where the central government needs to step to the front of the line and override provincial autonomy.</p>

<p>We just honoured our veterans on Remembrance Day for their service protecting our lives and freedoms. But we don't allow our veterans 65 or older to be vaccinated against the H1N1 virus until after the pandemic peaks, and after all other "priority" groups. That even though the average age of those who have died from H1N1 is more than 62.</p>
<p>Why have we prioritized the immunization of those most at risk of infection (those under 65) instead of those most at risk of death? It seems we have decided to not prioritize the saving of lives. What kind of sense, gratitude, and honour is in that? Our veterans and seniors are the reason we are here and free. They are not expendable. We have let them down. The shame is ours.</p>

<p>HEALTH officials will decide first thing today whether to open the province's H1N1 flu vaccination clinics to everyone.</p>
<p>The decision will come as long lineups -- especially in the morning -- have virtually disappeared at clinics set up around Manitoba.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, there were only 915 people vaccinated at a dozen mass clinics in Winnipeg -- the lowest number since the facilities first opened in late October, Heidi Graham, a spokeswoman for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said.</p>
<p>This morning, provincial and regional health officials will hold a conference call to decide whether to open the H1N1 vaccination clinics to all.</p>
<p>"We are watching the numbers carefully right now and still need to assess the after-school uptake later today," a provincial cabinet spokesman said in an email Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>"We will be prepared to open up the clinics to more groups (Wednesday) based on (Tuesday's) final numbers," he said.</p>
<p>In Thompson, the Burntwood Regional Health Authority, in concert with the province, removed restrictions on who could be vaccinated on Tuesday after numbers dwindled at immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Burntwood has a large percentage of people in the priority vaccination groups, but after a high initial turnout the numbers fell off rapidly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Winnipeg on Tuesday, attendance at H1N1 immunization clinics picked up in the afternoon, with 7,468 people receiving their vaccination by 8 p.m.</p>
<p>That brought the total number vaccinated in the city to 141,544.</p>

<p>Seven board members at the Misericordia Health Centre jumped the queue and got H1N1 vaccinations because of their positions, officials admitted Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two of the seven were on the province's list of individuals at high risk of becoming seriously ill. The offer of the vaccine at an internal hospital clinic meant they did not have to stand in line for hours at one of Winnipeg's dozen H1N1 vaccination clinics. The other five were vaccinated even though they were not on a priority list.</p>
<p>"In hindsight, this is something that wouldn't happen again," Winnipeg Regional Health Authority spokeswoman Heidi Graham said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Graham said the 13 members of the board of directors were offered the H1N1 shot at a board meeting on Oct. 27 by Misericordia Health Centre president and CEO Rosie Jacuzzi.</p>
<p>On the same day, the Misericordia was running a vaccination clinic for workers. Misericordia chief nursing officer Caroline DeKeyster said the offer to vaccinate was also made to other people who volunteer at the health centre.</p>
<p>"As volunteers, it was extended to them," she said. "They were just working that day."</p>
<p>DeKeyster also said the decision to vaccinate board members was made before the federal government told provincial heath officials there would be interruptions in the supply of the vaccine from manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>Conservative health critic Myrna Driedger said the preferential treatment shown the Misericordia board demonstrates mismanagement of the province's rollout of the H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of mixed messages that were being given in that first week including the people at the top," Driedger said.</p>
<p>A provincial spokesman called it an isolated incident. The province has respected the vaccination priority list from the beginning, the spokesman added.</p>
<p>A survey by the Free Press showed no other hospital board members in Winnipeg were offered or received H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>Graham confirmed that finding Tuesday.</p>
<p>"It hasn't even been a topic of conversation," Seven Oaks Hospital board of trustees chairman Stuart Greenfield said.</p>
<p>Health Sciences Centre Foundation board member, Jeff Rabb, said board members were not offered H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>Greenfield and Rabb said as responsible citizens they will only consider getting the vaccine when the WRHA opens clinics to all Manitobans.</p>
<p>Dr. John Wade, chairman of the WRHA board, said no offer was extended to the 19-member board.</p>
<p>Wade said he was only aware WRHA president Dr. Brian Postl got the shot on the first day clinics opened, Oct. 26.</p>
<p>As a practicing pediatrician, Postl was on the priority list. He was one of several prominent Winnipeggers who participated in the launch of Winnipeg's clinics.</p>
<p>In Quebec, Montreal's Jewish General Hospital was criticized for its decision to inoculate 200 donors who weren't on the priority list. Hospital officials said the donors spend a lot of time in the medical centre and come in contact with patients.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> was also criticized for immunizing its employees and their families ahead of priority groups.</p>
<p>In Ontario, board members at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital got the H1N1 shot last week and the University Health Network is offering the vaccine to its board and executives, along with nurses, doctors, volunteers and other hospital workers.</p>
<p>And while the Calgary Flames and Toronto Maple Leafs vaccinated players, there's been no fast-track for the Manitoba Moose or Winnipeg Blue Bombers.</p>
