<div id="hd"><b>Youth clinic to ease health system, director says; Downtown centre to help group that often falls between the cracks</b>

</p>
<p>The expanded downtown clinic for street youth that officially opened Wednesday will help ease the burden on the health-care system, said the executive director of the city's Youth Services Bureau.</p>
<p>Alex Munter says the full-time health clinic will help a group that traditionally falls through the cracks.</p>
<p>"What is so powerful ... is that by situating this health service in a youth-friendly, youth-focused environment, we anticipate that we will be able to treat young people and help them early," Munter said. "The bottom line here is young people will be healthier and we expect this population will use ambulances and emergency rooms a third less of the time."</p>
<p>The youth bureau partnered with the Sandy Hill Community Health Centre to bring primary care, mental health services and addictions treatment all under one roof for street youth.</p>
<p>Health services will now be offered at the YSB Besserer Street location between 2:30 and 5:30 p.m. Monday to Friday. The clinic was previously open with only limited hours as a pilot project.</p>
<p>The expanded clinic will include a nurse practitioner, help for youth without health cards and addictions and mental health case workers.</p>
<p>Munter hopes the expanded clinic will also help protect youth from H1N1. They are holding a vaccination clinic on Nov. 15 for clients and staff.</p>
<p>"Our drop-in staff is already very engaged in the promotion of prevention messages," Munter said. "Because of the age profile and risk profile of H1N1, it is a priority for us and we're focused right now on the prevention and vaccination."</p>
<p>The price tag to open and operate the expanded health clinic is around $250,000 for the first year, and is provided by the Champlain Local Health Integration Network.</p>
<p>YSB called on the Ontario government in January to fund the full-time health clinic.</p>
<p>A report compiled by KPMG Canada for YSB found that a clinic for street youth could save the health care system up to $265,000 in the first year.</p>

<p>I can't recall the last time I was this angry and upset about something as elementary as a vaccine. I'm referring to the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>We are practically being arm-wrestled into getting it - a substance that seems to have been whipped up overnight with obviously no long-range testing, given the time frame.The suspicions floating around the origins of the virus make the situation worse.</p>
<p>Right now, I'm more scared of the vaccine than of the virus itself.</p>

</p>
<p>As we read reports of H1N1 spreading rapidly, I cannot help but be alarmed at the apparently slow pace of planned vaccination clinics in Montreal. I consulted the Pandémie Québec site to find that vaccinations do not begin until next week for selected parts of the population. According to the website, it won't be until the week of Dec. 7 that healthy adults and children over 5 can seek a vaccination on the island of Montreal.</p>
<p>After reading about otherwise healthy children and teenagers dying from H1N1, I am stunned that it will be another five weeks before most of the population can even seek a vaccination.</p>
<p>Although the website says there will be daily updates, I hope the health authorities in Montreal find a way of accelerating the schedule or we risk having a widespread pandemic in Montreal with most of the population unable to get vaccinated in time.</p>

<p>The Canadiens might be doing some hand-wringing after last night's lopsided loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins, but the priority these days is definitely hand-washing.</p>
<p>This is the start of flu season and, with the added threat of the H1N1 virus, the players and the team's medical and equipment staffs are on high alert.</p>
<p>"We're just trying to do all the right things," veteran defenceman Jaroslav Spacek said. "You wash your hands, dress for the weather, eat well. Just common sense."</p>
<p>The Canadiens' training staff deserves the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval for its efforts to disinfect the common areas at the Bell Centre and the team's training facility in Brossard. And when players do show signs of flu-like symptoms, as Glen Metropolit and Scott Gomez have in the past week, there are efforts to isolate them as much as possible.</p>
<p>Neither player has missed a game because of the flu, but Metropolit missed practices and Gomez skipped practice Tuesday and rested in the team hotel yesterday while his teammates participated in the morning skate.</p>
<p>Several other NHL teams have experienced problems with the flu and there have been at least five confirmed cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>In the past week, the Edmonton Oilers had trouble dressing 20 players for a game in Vancouver. The Detroit Red Wings followed the Oilers into Vancouver and Wings head coach Mike Babcock insisted on having the room disinfected before his team arrived.</p>
<p>Gill gets his bling: Canadiens defenceman Hal Gill was so focussed on the morning skate yesterday that he failed to look up into the rafters here to see the Stanley Cup banner he helped win earlier this year.</p>
<p>"I didn't even think about it," said Gill, who was patrolling the blue line for the Penguins last season. "I'm not much on nostalgia. I'm concentrating on where I am now."</p>
<p>But Gill, remembered fondly by former teammates as a practical joker, will return home with one souvenir of the championship season. He took advantage of the visit to pick up his Stanley Cup ring, which is a serious hunk of bling.</p>
<p>Each 14-karat white and yellow gold ring contains 167 diamonds, with a total weight of approximately 41/2 carats and 100 grams of gold.</p>
<p>The right side has the year "2009" split with three Stanley Cups, adorned in diamonds. The two outer Stanley Cups are inscribed on top with "91" and "92," paying homage to the Penguins' two previous championships.</p>
<p>The top of the ring is crowned with a custom-cut black onyx embedded with a 1.3-carat pear-shaped diamond to create the Penguins logo on an image of the Stanley Cup, which is sitting on a bed of diamonds replicating the arena and ice surface.</p>
<p>SK-74 ailing: Sergei Kostitsyn has missed the Hamilton Bulldogs' last two games, but it's not because he has been misbehaving again. Sergei, who has been suspended twice this season by the Canadiens after expressing his unhappiness over being sent to Hamilton, is listed as day-to-day because of a sore shoulder and strep throat. He should be back in the lineup this weekend.</p>

<p>The total of National Hockey League players diagnosed with the H1N1 virus increased to four on Wednesday. Washington Capitals forward Quintin Laing was the third player to be diagnosed with the illness this week. On Tuesday, their teams confirmed that Edmonton Oilers defenceman Ladislav Smid and Colorado Avalanche goalie Peter Budaj had H1N1. Smid said Wednesday he contracted the virus about two weeks ago, but didn't know he had it until Tuesday.</p>
<p>His neighbour in the dressing room, Lubomir Visnovsky, left Tuesday's game against Colorado exhausted despite playing only 16 minutes. Visnovsky had not been tested, but was being treated as if he had H1N1. New York Islanders forward Doug Weight revealed on Wednesday that he had recovered from H1N1 after missing three games.</p>
<p>Gagné on injured list</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Flyers said Wednesday placed forward Simon Gagné on the long-term injury list with two small hernias. Flyers general manager Paul Holmgren said the team wouldn't know until today at the earliest whether Gagné would require surgery.</p>
<p>Canucks Luongo out</p>
<p>Vancouver Canucks goaltender Roberto Luongo has a hairline fracture of a rib on his left side and won't be in the lineup when the Canucks play Thursday in Los Angeles and Friday in Anaheim.</p>

<p>God help us all if a real crisis arises in our Ottawa community. We have been getting frequent updates in the news and are being encouraged to get vaccinated against H1N1.</p>
<p>My husband, who has MS, waited in line from 1:45 till 5:45 p.m. Monday afternoon. How smart is it to ask people with compromised immune systems, seniors, young children and pregnant women to stand in line for four hours?</p>
<p>Come on officials, use your brains -- hire more staff and open more locations.</p>

</p>
<p>This week marked the beginning of the H1N1 vaccination clinics, the biggest mass immunization program in the history of our city.</p>
<p>As chairperson of the City of Ottawa's community and protective services committee, I want to inform the public about what the city is doing to expedite the implementation of the program.</p>
<p>I want to assure the public that everyone in the City of Ottawa who wants the vaccination will get one.</p>
<p>The staff members in our public health department are working hard to prepare our residents for this pandemic as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>On the first day, more than 4,200 residents were vaccinated. On the second day, an estimated 5,300 residents were vaccinated. Including the doses administered to local hospital and paramedic staff, we have given out well more than 10,000 doses of vaccines in the first two days this week.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to be one of the first municipalities in Ontario to start vaccinating residents, as most municipalities will not begin until November.</p>
<p>Given the huge uptake of the vaccination and the immensity of the job ahead, we have experienced line-ups that are longer than anticipated. This is true in other cities that began immunization this week.</p>
<p>I personally visited a number of the vaccination sites and am impressed by the dedication of our public health staff and partners. I have spoken with people in the lines about their concerns with the rollout of the program. As a parent, I understand how important it is for our children to get access to timely vaccinations.</p>
<p>I can assure the public that as we receive more of the vaccine and hire more staff, the number of daily vaccinations will increase. After the first day of vaccinations, 40 additional staff were hired and more will be added in the coming days.</p>
<p>We appreciate your patience and co-operation, and will continue to work to ensure that the residents of Ottawa are well served and immunized as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>Good job, Ottawa public health workers!</p>
<p>As the mother of a two year old and a four year old, I arrived at the Kanata Recreational Centre Tuesday at 12:22 p.m. to line up for the H1N1 vaccine. At 1:15 p.m. Ottawa public health officials handed out numbers and we were the 70th family in line.</p>
<p>The clinic opened at 2:30 p.m. and our number was called at 3:15 p.m.</p>
<p>The staff and nurses were highly organized, efficient and friendly. I know it is their job, but it can't be an easy one these days. They clearly had more nurses on site as well as a paramedic team. If there were mistakes and hold-ups on Day 1, they took note and improved on what they could do for Day 2. What more can we ask?</p>

<p>Re: Misinformation on vaccines is highly contagious, Oct. 17.</p>
<p>I thank Dr. Catherine D'Amico for her opinion article in the Citizen. She tries to counteract misinformation about the flu vaccine, but she is facing an uphill battle.</p>
<p>I am taking a wait-and-see approach. Because the public is afraid of being inoculated, our medical community must answer these concerns.</p>
<p>- Why do doctors continue to deny that the flu vaccine can make us sick, when so many of us have been sick the day after we got previous flu vaccines?</p>
<p>- Anyone can find information online (and view the report that was aired on 60 Minutes) to learn of the swine flu fiasco of 1976 in the U.S. Tell us what happened and what has changed so we should trust this vaccine.</p>
<p>- Show us the numbers from the previous flu shots given in this province, to prove that they've saved lives -- or even prevented sickness.</p>
<p>- These inoculations are created each year in response to new disease, and there doesn't seem to be any followup to see the general effects on our health over the long term.</p>
<p>- We're afraid of being injected with something that harms, rather than protects. It's evident that we no longer suffer from horrifying illnesses such as small pox, thanks to inoculations -- so we aren't against them, in general. But we hesitate to inject our families with a brand new vaccine that the system has rushed through in order to test its pandemic procedures.</p>
<p>With so many stakeholders involved, it's only human to make some serious, misguided mistakes.</p>
<p>We are not a society of idiots. Yes, we do go on the Internet. And yes, there is some bad information out there. But are we to believe that only the "bad guys" are putting information out there for us to access? Where is the "good" information?</p>
<p>For many of us, we will wait until it's evident that people are dying in droves from this flu. And when that starts, we'll line up and get the shot.</p>

<p>Get the seasonal flu vaccine. It won't protect you directly against the H1N1 virus, but will prevent you from getting seasonal flu, which weakens your immune system and makes you more susceptible to H1N1.</p>
<p>Cover your nose and mouth with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw the tissue in the trash after you use it.</p>
<p>Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially after you cough or sneeze. Alcohol-based cleansers are also effective.</p>
<p>Avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth. Germs spread this way.</p>
<p>Try to avoid close contact (within two metres) with sick people.</p>
<p>Keep household surfaces clean. Regularly wipe bedside tables, bathrooms, kitchen counters and children's toys with a household disinfectant.</p>
<p>Be prepared in case you get sick and need to stay home for a week or so. A supply of food, over-the-counter medicines, alcohol-based hand rubs, tissues and other related items could help avoid the need to go out in public while you are sick and contagious.</p>
<p>If you are sick with a flu-like illness, stay home for at least 24 hours after your fever is gone. Keep away from others as much as possible.</p>
<p>If you're pregnant or have diabetes, obesity, heart or lung trouble, take extra precautions to avoid illness and seek medical attention when you develop flu-like symptoms. Your health-care provider will determine whether flu treatment is needed.</p>
<p>If you have severe illness, such as difficulty breathing, go to your local emergency department.</p>

<p>At least seven more deaths in Canada from the H1N1 virus came to light Tuesday as the second wave of the pandemic continued to spread, with some schools reporting absences akin to peak flu season and hospitals taking in more patients infected with the bug. News that a 13-year-old Toronto boy area succumbed to the human swine flu was confirmed. Toronto Public Health disclosed that Evan Frustaglia, a Grade 8 student and minor hockey player, who seemed otherwise healthy, died suddenly after showing only minor symptoms over the weekend. The total deaths in Canada, related to complications from H1N1, is 94. Included is Vanetia Warner, 10, from Cornwall, who fell victim last weekend and a woman from near Westport, Ont. More than 1,500 have been hospitalized and provinces reported that the numbers are growing.</p>

<p>A U.S. government agency says the Internet in that country could actually break if an H1N1 flu pandemic forced millions to telecommute, a finding that has implications for Canada, because the continent's telecommunications backbones are so closely connected. The U.S. Government Accountability Office has warned that, if millions of Americans stayed away from work or school because of the flu, but tried to work or study using home Internet connections, the resulting congestion would bring network traffic to a halt.</p>

<p>The U.S. government may end up throwing away unused doses of swine flu vaccine if people cannot get it soon enough, the director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Tuesday. Members of Congress questioned whether federal officials were too rosy in their estimates of how much vaccine would be available and when, and companies said they were still struggling to produce immunizations against H1N1.</p>

</div><div>Joanne Chianello   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>625 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>If you have school-aged children, you may be tempted to sit them down and give them a good talking to about H1N1.</p>
<p>Resist.</p>
<p>Haranguing kids to obsessively wash their hands or to shun schoolmates with a slight cough will only freak them out -- and will likely not help them avoid the flu.</p>
<p>Here's how health professionals say you should talk to your kids about H1N1:</p>
<p>- If your children don't raise the issue, it's up to you to do it. One way to approach the topic is to ask what they've heard about it, so you know what's going through their minds. "They may or may not raise it, but they're probably thinking about it," says Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>- Answer all questions -- and correct all misconceptions -- as clearly as possible. That means getting up to speed on H1N1 information yourself. Be concrete in your answers and do not avoid difficult questions. If you don't know the answer, it's OK to say, "I don't know, but I'll find out." Then do it.</p>
<p>- Calm down. "Kids pick up on our anxieties," says Butler-Jones. "If it sounds like we know what we're doing, then they're reassured." This will be easier if you're confident in the facts.</p>
<p>- Avoid calling it "swine flu." "That can sound scary for kids, who often make visual associations," says Dr. Virginia Bourget, a psychologist at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. "A scary pig -- that's even worse than bird flu!" Try to stick to H1N1, or if that's a bit too scientific, try influenza. Even plain old "flu" will do.</p>
<p>- It's not their job. Although you should answer their questions about the flu, you must make it clear that it's not their job to worry about how to manage it -- at home or at school.</p>
<p>"Children will often think they're responsible for things they aren't responsible for," says Bourget. "That makes them insecure."</p>
<p>- Shield them. It's inevitable that children will hear all kinds of things about H1N1 -- accurate and inaccurate -- but limit their exposure to media reports and adult conversations about the flu. They aren't appropriate for most school-aged children and can raise their anxiety levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>- Don't brush off your kids' fears about the seriousness of H1N1, but do try to bring some perspective. If your son asks if people can die from this flu, don't lie. But do impress upon him that deaths in Canada have been rare, and most of those who died were already sick with something else.</p>
<p>- Reminding children about good hygiene habits is never a bad idea, but badgering children to wash or disinfect their hands probably won't lead to them doing it more often.</p>
<p>Scaring them will not change their behaviour. Instead, reinforce those habits by practising good hygiene yourself at home. At school, teachers will also lead by example, directing the entire class to wash their hands before lunch.</p>
<p>- If a classmate or friend gets sick -- which is likely -- make sure you explain to your children that it doesn't necessarily mean they too will get sick. And if they do, stress that you will take care of them the way you always do.</p>
<p>- Children always need to feel safe and loved, and if they are worried about a situation like a flu pandemic, that need will increase. Make sure you let your kids know it's OK to feel angry or afraid.</p>

<p>"If I had kids I'd certainly want to get them the vaccine." Such is the advice from a scientist who won a Nobel Prize for his research on the human immune system.</p>
<p>Speaking to students at Carleton University Wednesday, Peter Doherty said it's particularly important that young people be immunized against the H1N1 virus, or swine flu virus as he preferred to call it. "We've seen these deaths in kids," he said, referring to two Ontario youths, Evan Frustaglio, 13, and Vanetia Warner, 10, who died in that last week shortly after showing flu symptoms.</p>
<p>But it's not just children that are threatened, Doherty said. "We're seeing deaths in healthy young people. We've seen big problems in pregnant women in their third trimester. We've seen increased incidents of high mortality in people who are obese, and in some indigenous populations. Some people are really at risk."</p>
<p>Doherty was one of four Nobel laureates in Ottawa Wednesday to mark the 50th anniversary of the prestigious Canada Gairdner Awards, which recognize significant contributions to medical science and research.</p>
<p>Doherty, an Australian researcher who won the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine jointly with Rolf Zinkernagel in 1996 for research that focused on the immune system, and Harald zur Hausen, a German virologist who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2008 for his discovery that certain human papilloma viruses lead to cervical cancer, which led to the development of a vaccine introduced in 2006, spoke to about 300 university and high school students.</p>
<p>Two other Nobel laureates, Rolf Zinkernagel, a professor of experimental immunology who was awarded the Nobel prize in 1996 for his work in the discovery of how the immune system distinguishes virus-infected cells from normal cells, and Bengt Samuelsson, an emeritus professor at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden who won in 1982 for his discoveries concerning prostaglandins and related biologically active substances, addressed students at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>The four are all past recipients of Gairdner Awards. Their respective speeches were aimed at encouraging young people to consider careers in science. But with the H1N1flu virus making headlines, Doherty didn't hesitate to address the topic, suggesting that vaccinations were the socially responsible thing to do.</p>
<p>The swine-flu virus is "scary" because of the suddenness with which it appeared in humans, said Doherty, who conducts research at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee and teaches at the University of Tennessee and the University of Melbourne in Australia.</p>
<p>He noted how the disease appeared suddenly in Mexico in late 2008 and early 2009, and rapidly spread across North American and around the world. The threat now is that the virus has mutated into a more virulent form, Doherty said, pointing out that happened in the 1918 influenza epidemic that swept around the world and killed millions.</p>
<p>The possibility the same might happen today underscores the need to get H1N1 flu shots to encourage "herd immunity," said Doherty.</p>
<p>Herd immunity occurs when the vaccination of a certain portion of a population provides sufficient protection to those who haven't been immunized.</p>
<p>It then becomes much more difficult for a disease to pass from one person to another and thus maintain its "chain of infection" when a large portion of the population is immune.</p>
<p>"Herd immunity is very important," Doherty said. "If you've got the majority of your population immune, the virus will spread less quickly."</p>

<div>877 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>School-aged children will not be turned away from the city's H1N1 vaccination clinics, Ottawa's medical officer of health said Wednesday, after reports that two Ontario children, aged 10 and 13, have died of the virus.</p>
<p>But Dr. Isra Levy urged parents to give priority voluntarily to the high-risk groups that have already been identified -- and which do not include healthy children over the age of five.</p>
<p>"We're health professionals. We're not bouncers. But we continue to ask people to respect the indications," said Dr. Nadine Sicard, associate medical officer of health, at a joint press conference with Levy.</p>
<p>Levy added that, although school-aged children who show up for the clinics will be vaccinated, the scientific evidence for excluding them from the priority groups remains sound.</p>
<p>Three days into the vaccination campaign, with lineups several hours long at a half-dozen city-run clinics, Ottawa health officials continue to ask that precedence be given to five high-risk groups:</p>
<p>- pregnant women;</p>
<p>- people aged six months to 65 years with chronic medical conditions;</p>
<p>- children aged six months to five years;</p>
<p>- front-line health-care workers; and</p>
<p>- people who care for children under six months or for patients with compromised immune systems.</p>
<p>Levy said there are an estimated 200,000 Ottawans in those categories. So far, Ottawa Public Health has received 37,500 doses of vaccine, with another shipment of 37,500 doses expected to arrive Wednesday evening or Thursday.</p>
<p>Though some parents have expressed concern about giving the adjuvanted vaccine -- the only version available yet, with a booster agent -- to young children, Sicard said that it is the most effective vaccine for children under three years old, whose immune systems are immature and do not react well to un-adjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>A shipment of unadjuvanted vaccine meant for pregnant women is expected to arrive in November.</p>
<p>As of early Wednesday afternoon, about 13,000 doses of H1N1 vaccine had been administered, Levy said, including 3,000 given to hospital staff. He acknowledged that the public health unit's ability to immunize residents has not been able to keep up with demand.</p>
<p>"We will continue to strive for improvements in the experience residents have," he said. "I fully understand the frustration people standing in line, or not even able to get into line, would have... I again ask for continued patience. We are doing what we can."</p>
<p>He said the public health unit is actively recruiting nurses and volunteers to help run the clinics. As well, vaccines are now being sent to hospitals so that they can immunize their own staff.</p>
<p>The public health unit is also planning to fast-track the process of getting vaccines out to family doctors and health clinics that are able and willing to administer the vaccine. Originally, the plan was not to distribute vaccine outside of city-run clinics until the second or third week of the vaccination campaign. That's because a survey earlier this fall indicated that only three out of 10 family doctors were able and willing to administer the H1N1 vaccine, Levy said. The vaccine requires careful refrigeration and is delivered in bulk quantities.</p>
<p>Faced with calls to increase the hours of the city-run immunization clinics, most of which are only open from 2:30 to 8:30 p.m. on weekdays and six hours earlier in the day on weekends, Levy said there is not enough staff to fill the extra hours, and that the nurses are exhausted.</p>
<p>"We would love to be able to operate longer hours, but right now we don't have the capacity," he said.</p>
<p>Levy said that although flu activity is increasing in the community, most cases continue to be mild. Since September, 111 Ottawa residents have tested positive for the virus, of whom 28 have been hospitalized and one, an elderly man with underlying medical conditions, has died.</p>
<p>Currently there are five Ottawa residents in hospital with H1N1, of whom four are in intensive care and two are on ventilators, Levy said.</p>
<p>O'Brien drops by clinic</p>
<p>Mayor Larry O'Brien visited the clinic at the Tom Brown Arena Wednesday evening, to "commiserate" with the people standing in line.</p>
<p>"I want them to understand that I do know how it feels to wait. I had my fair share of waiting over the summer," he quipped, referring to his lengthy trial.</p>
<p>The mayor said he felt the city is doing what it can.</p>
<p>"I'm comfortable that Dr. Levy is doing an outstanding job," he said.</p>
<p>At the arena, O'Brien faced the special challenge of a politician at a flu clinic: by instinct he kept shaking hands with people, without a hand sanitizer in his pocket.</p>
<p>"It's in the car," he said. "You're right, I should have the Purel."</p>

</div><div>Dave Rogers   </div>

</p>
<p>Gatineau health officials say they were not organized in time and did not have enough space or staff to meet the demand for H1N1 flu vaccine at the city's first public clinic on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Anyone who arrived after 9 a.m. at a temporary vaccination clinic at Les Promenades de l'Outaouais shopping centre on Maloney Boulevard was turned away because the clinic had already reached its capacity of about 700 people for the day.</p>
<p>Gatineau's health and social-services centre invited women who are more than 20 weeks pregnant and children between six months and five years old to get the H1N1 flu vaccine at the city's only clinic, a small former branch of the <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span>. But 30 minutes after the clinic opened at 8:30 a.m., health officials told late arrivals to return another day.</p>
<p>People from as far away as Thurso lined up shortly after 5 a.m. and by 7:30 a.m. the line stretched along a corridor of the mall as hundreds of people joined the first arrivals.</p>
<p>Alain Lefebvre, 38, who took the day off to bring his daughter Isabella, 4, to the clinic just before noon did not know that staff were turning children and pregnant women away.</p>
<p>"People should be advised that there is only so much vaccine available," Lefebvre said. "I don't think that this vaccination program is organized well enough. I can't come back tomorrow because I have to work.</p>
<p>"There should be one clinic each in the Gatineau, Hull, Aylmer and Buckingham sectors. If they want to nip the flu in the bud, they should vaccinate people sooner rather than later. There are several clinics on the other side of the Ottawa River, but we can't go there to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>(People have to show provincial health cards to be eligible for the vaccine.)</p>
<p>Joanne Duquette said she expected that she could get her daughter Marianne vaccinated because she read about the clinic on a Quebec government website. She said clinic staff told her to return Thursday with her husband and three children.</p>
<p>Caroline Milliard, a spokeswoman for the Centre de santé et de services sociaux de Gatineau, said there are 15,000 doses of vaccine. She said it is not possible to vaccinate more people because the clinic opened two weeks earlier than expected, health officials couldn't get enough staff in time and there wasn't the space to accommodate more people.</p>
<p>"We had to organize this clinic very rapidly because it started two weeks ahead of schedule for some priority clientele," Milliard said. "The clinic can vaccinate 700 people a day and for now that is the capacity. That is because of the location, the personnel, the number of doses of vaccine and the limited time we had to get this ready."</p>
<p>Milliard said more nurses, clerical staff, security guards and volunteers will be available when the larger clinics open. Some public health programs in schools and community centres will be interrupted so staff can work on the vaccination program.</p>
<p>Milliard said two mass vaccination clinics will open Nov. 9 at another site at Les Promenades de l'Outaouais and at Place Cartier on Saint-Joseph Boulevard. The larger clinics are expected to be able to vaccinate 3,200 people a day.</p>
<p>Health officials asked women who are less than 20 weeks pregnant, people who are under 65 with chronic health problems, those with weakened immune systems and people who live with babies under six months old -- other priority groups identified for early vaccinations by the federal Public Health Agency of Canada -- to wait for the CSSS Gatineau's decision on when they can be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Other people will have to wait until later, probably at least early to mid-November for H1N1 vaccinations. Most clinics are expected start on or about Nov. 9 and continue into January.</p>

</p>
<p>Symptoms and Severity</p>
<p>How do I know if I or my children have the H1N1 virus or seasonal flu?</p>
<p>It's believed that there is no seasonal flu in Ottawa now. If you or someone in your family is showing flu-like symptoms, then it's most likely you have H1N1. The only way to confirm that is to have a laboratory test, and only flu patients who are hospitalized will continue to be tested for H1N1.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of the H1N1 virus?</p>
<p>Everybody who gets the flu is going to have a fever and cough, and likely a sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, body aches, headache, chills and fatigue. In some cases they will have diarrhea and vomiting.</p>
<p>What should I do if I or my child get sick?</p>
<p>Stay home and avoid contact with other people, except to get medical care. This means avoiding normal activities, including work, school, travel, shopping, social events and public gatherings.</p>
<p>When should I call my doctor?</p>
<p>Most children who get sick can be cared for at home. But for children over five years old, the symptoms that should trigger a call to a physician are:</p>
<p>- fast or troubled breathing,</p>
<p>- bluish or grey skin colour,</p>
<p>- not drinking enough fluids,</p>
<p>- severe or persistent vomiting,</p>
<p>- not waking up or not interacting,</p>
<p>- being so irritable that the child does not want to be held, and</p>
<p>- flu-like symptoms improve but then return with fever and worse cough.</p>
<p>In adults, you should call your doctor if you experience the following:</p>
<p>- difficulty breathing or shortness of breath,</p>
<p>- bluish or grey skin colour,</p>
<p>- bloody or coloured sputum,</p>
<p>- chest pains,</p>
<p>- sudden dizziness or confusion,</p>
<p>- severe or persistent vomiting, and/or</p>
<p>- high fever lasting more than three days.</p>
<p>At-risk patients -- children under five, especially under two; pregnant women; people with chronic conditions such as heart, liver, kidney or lung disease, asthma, neurological disorders and people who are immuno-suppressed, or have blood disorders, diabetes, or severe obesity -- should call their physicians as soon as they come down with the typical flu symptoms, because they are at high risk of developing the complications of H1N1 and need to be treated early.</p>
<p>At what point is a fever considered high or dangerous?</p>
<p>A temperature is a fever when it's over 38 C. When it gets up to 39.5 to 40 C is when you start to consider it high for adults and children. "Unless it gets well over 43 Celsius, a fever is not harmful, it's just indicative of something going on," says Hui.</p>
<p>When will I know it's time to go to the hospital?</p>
<p>It's hard to generalize, but if the ill person is unresponsive or difficult to rouse, or having great difficulty breathing, they should probably go straight to emergency. A call to your family doctor may help you decide. If you don't have one, try Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000, which is staffed 24/7.</p>
<p>Should I call an ambulance or should I drive?</p>
<p>Again, it's difficult to generalize, but if the person is turning blue or a mottled colour, or loses consciousness and can't be easily roused, then you should call 911 for an ambulance. If your child is ill and you decide to drive, says Dr. Ken Farion, acting medical director in the emergency department at CHEO, "try to avoid being a parent alone driving a child to Emergency -- you can't be watching your child and watching the road at the same time. If there isn't another parent at home, ask a neighbour to drive you."</p>
<p>Is Tamiflu a good idea for children under 10?</p>
<p>The treatment for people who are already sick with influenza "has been shown to be effective in many studies, even for kids," says Hui.</p>
<p>How can I get Tamiflu?</p>
<p>By prescription from a primary-care physician. It's important to know that it works best when it's given earlier, within 48 hours.</p>
<p>My child was sick, got better and now is sick again -- should we get a Tamiflu prescription?</p>
<p>That depends on other factors, so it's best to consult your doctor.</p>
<p>How soon can my child go back to school after being sick?</p>
<p>Children have to be without a fever for more than 24 hours and their symptoms have to be completely resolved except for a small cough before they can go back to school. It can take seven to 10 days to get over H1N1 and the cough can linger for many weeks.</p>
<p>If my child is healthy but I'm hearing that lots of kids at school are sick, should I keep my child home? Should we avoid sports and other group activities?</p>
<p>No -- Ottawa Public Health is monitoring the situation and if need be, they will ask for school closures. If your child is well, he or she can go to school. Public Health is not recommending that people avoid mass gatherings.</p>
<p>Will the school board identify the schools with high rates of H1N1 so parents can make their own decisions about keeping their kids at home?</p>
<p>No. The school board only knows which schools have high rates of absenteeism, not what's keeping children away.</p>
<p>How long can an infected person spread the H1N1 virus to others?</p>
<p>People infected with H1N1 or seasonal flu can infect others from one day before showing symptoms to seven days afterward.</p>
<p>What can I do to protect myself from getting sick?</p>
<p>Get the H1N1 vaccine when it is available at your local clinic operated by public health. For addresses and information on Ottawa, go to ottawa.ca/health; the Citizen has information on the city and outlying areas at ottawacitizen.com/flu.</p>
<p>Vaccine</p>
<p>Should my child get the H1N1 vaccine if he's already had the flu?</p>
<p>"If the child has had a laboratory-confirmed H1N1 infection in the spring, and they're otherwise well, then they do not need the vaccine," says Hui.</p>
<p>That's different from somebody who went to a doctor and was told they had the flu -- that's not laboratory-confirmed diagnosis. If you're at high risk or you are immuno-suppressed, then CHEO infectious-disease physicians say that regardless of whether you've been tested for it before, get the vaccine. Even if you've already had H1N1, the vaccine will provide further protection.</p>
<p>If my child is feeling sick now, should she still get the vaccine now?</p>
<p>If she has a mild illness, she should get it. If she has a high fever and is acutely unwell, she should not get it until her symptoms improve.</p>
<p>Can my four-month-old baby get the vaccine?</p>
<p>No. Children under six months should not get the vaccine. Children from six months to 10 years should get the vaccine in two doses, 21 days apart, though the science is still evolving on whether one shot might be enough. Stay tuned.</p>
<p>How soon after the shot will the vaccine take effect?</p>
<p>It depends whether you're getting one or two shots. Preliminary studies show that antibodies develop seven to 10 days after, and full coverage is achieved 21 days later.</p>
<p>For children, it's believed that full protection is achieved 21 days after the second shot.</p>
<p>What kind of adverse reactions should I look for after my children get the vaccine?</p>
<p>Some people experience pain and minor swelling at the site of the injection. Some have fatigue, headache and joint pain, and some people will get muscle pains.</p>
<p>"These are known adverse events, they're not reason to seek medical attention," says Hui.</p>
<p>If anything else develops and seems to be persistent, you should speak to a doctor.</p>
<p>"I would say the benefit of getting the H1N1 vaccine far outweighs any potential or theoretical risk out there," says Hui.</p>
<p>How should parents react to hearing stories like the one in Toronto, where the 13-year-old boy went from a sore throat to death in just days?</p>
<p>"It's always tragic when someone dies, for any reason," says Hui. "Influenza is known to cause the deaths of many people on a yearly basis. A very small minority of those are otherwise healthy people. So it does occur, but that's not the vast majority of people.</p>
<p>"What we are experiencing here and in the U.S. is that with H1N1, most of the people who have complications associated with H1N1 are people with underlying disease.</p>
<p>"However, there are some people who are otherwise well that do unfortunately die. We are unable to identify who those people are right now.</p>
<p>"It causes a lot of anxiety to parents when something like that happens, but it is not common, it's very rare," says Hui.</p>

<p>Open Niagara boat lease</p>
<p>to bids, province orders</p>
<p>The provincial government has torpedoed the iconic Maid of the Mist's 25-year lease to operate tour boats at Niagara Falls.</p>
<p>In a surprise move Wednesday, Tourism Minister Monique Smith ordered the Niagara Parks Commission to open a competitive process to lease land for tour boat operations in the Niagara gorge.</p>
<p>The parks commission awarded the New York-based Maid of the Mist a $650 million, 25-year lease extension last year without seeking competing bids. The Maid of the Mist has operated tours on the Niagara River since 1846. The competition for the boat service will be completed next spring.</p>

<p>Liberals' body-bag flyer</p>

<p>A First Nations leader lashed out at the federal Liberals for a partisan pamphlet about the H1N1 pandemic he said exploited a painful experience for political gain.</p>
<p>"I was distressed to see some feedback that used our people - even our children - like props in political theatre," Ron Evans, grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs, told a Commons committee on Wednesday. Evans held up a black-and-white Liberal political flyer with the headline "No vaccines, just body bags."</p>
<p>News last month that body bags had been shipped to a Manitoba First Nations community caused an uproar. Many took it as a callous response to cries for help from those hardest hit by the outbreak.</p>

</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby had his third career hat trick and the Pittsburgh Penguins became the first NHL team to reach 10 victories this season, snapping the Montreal Canadiens' four-game winning streak with a 6-1 victory.</p>
<p>Crosby, tied for fourth in the NHL with nine goals, had his third multiple-goal game in 12 starts this season for Pittsburgh (10-2-0).</p>
<p>Chris Kunitz also scored and assisted on all three of Crosby's goals. Mike Rupp and Alex Goligoski added goals. Bill Guerin had three assists.</p>
<p>Marc-Andre Fleury made 23 saves, allowing only Tomas Plekanec's power-play goal.</p>
<p>Montreal's Jaroslav Halak stopped 19-of-23 shots before he was pulled after the second period.</p>
<p>Crosby extended his point streak to five games, completing a hat trick during the first 36 minutes, giving him nine goals in October for the first time in his career.</p>
<p>Last season, Crosby's ninth goal came a full month later on Nov. 28.</p>
<p>Clarke MacArthur and rookie Tim Kennedy scored early in the first period and the Buffalo Sabres remained unbeaten on the road with a 4-1 victory over the New Jersey Devils.</p>
<p>Ryan Miller made 31 saves. Paul Gaustad and Jason Pominville iced the game with third-period goals.</p>
<p>Nick Foligno and Jarkko Ruutu scored second-period goals to help the Ottawa Senators beat the Florida Panthers 4-3.</p>
<p>Mike Fisher and Daniel Alfredsson also scored, and defenceman Filip Kuba added two assists after missing the previous eight games because of a lower-body injury.</p>
<p>Doug Weight, in his first game back following a bout with H1N1 flu, earned an assist on Kyle Okposo's tie-breaking, power-play goal in the second period that lifted the New York Islanders to a 3-1 victory over the New York Rangers.</p>
<p>Islanders rookie John Tavares, the No. 1 pick in this year's draft, snapped a four-game scoreless streak with 5: 06 left by netting his fourth goal in the team's first regulation win.</p>
<p>Martin Hanzal, Zbynek Michalek and Robert Lang scored power-play goals and Jason LaBarbera stopped 31 shots in the Phoenix Coyotes' 4-1 victory over the Columbus Blue Jackets.</p>
<p>The Coyotes, the stingiest team in the Western Conference, have given up just 23 goals in their first 11 games.</p>
<p>Jerred Smithson scored a short-handed goal midway through the third period to give the <span class="companylink">Nashville Predators</span> their second regulation victory of the season, 4-3 over the Minnesota Wild.</p>
<p>After a clearing attempt on Minnesota's power play squirted past Wild defenceman Marek Zidlicky along the boards, Smithson raced to the puck, pulled it back in the slot to avoid Brent Burns, and beat goalie Niklas Backstrom to give Nashville its first regulation victory since Oct. 8 against Colorado.</p>
<p>David Perron had two goals, Yan Stastny and Jay McClement scored 16 seconds apart, and Chris Mason made 34 saves to help the St. Louis Blues beat the Carolina Hurricanes 5-2.</p>
<p>Carolina is 0-4-3 in its last seven games.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine myths frustrate doctors; Public health officials worry that detractors will prevent people from getting H1N1 shots</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>739 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- He says it is like believing that umbrellas cause downpours and blaming ice cream for sunburns.</p>
<p>"I guess what frustrates me is the amount of mythology out there," Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the federal public health agency, told reporters this week when asked about theories and fears about swine flu vaccine circulating online and in school parking lots.</p>
<p>"The anti-vaccine movement, really, its efforts are to create doubt, so they keep throwing things out. 'Oh, it causes brain damage.' Well, you prove that it doesn't cause brain damage. 'Oh, it causes cancer.' Well, you prove it doesn't cause cancer. 'Oh, it causes your car radio to die,'" Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>The so-called anti-vaccine movement - a loose collection of concerned parents and PhDs on the lecture circuit trying to educate the public about perceived dangers of immunization - has been around for decades but has gained strength with the rise of social networking and citizen journalism.</p>
<p>They swap lists of vaccine ingredients. They analyze medical research. Celebrity couple Jenny McCarthy (whose son was diagnosed with autism) and Jim Carrey, through their non-profit organization Generation Rescue, link vaccines to autism.</p>
<p>The Vaccination Risk Awareness Network does not tell people what to do, said its coordinator, Edda West. "We absolutely never go there. We don't have the right to take upon ourselves responsibility for what other people do with their health," West said Tuesday from Winlaw, B.C. "Our role is to put out information that we can from all sorts of sources."</p>
<p>But public health officials worry the ideas of the anti-vaccine movement at least superficially play a role in pushing people who may be already hesitant to get the H1N1 vaccine into the "no, thanks" camp.</p>
<p>The officials think that camp is already big enough. The federal government was under heavy pressure all summer to rush its vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline Inc., but now that it's finally here polls have shown about half of the country does not plan to get it.</p>
<p>West refers to the work of epidemiologist Tom Jefferson of the international research network Cochrane Collaboration, who has been outspoken in his condemnation of the seasonal flu vaccine. His team of researchers tore apart hundreds of flu studies and dismissed all but four of them as garbage.</p>
<p>"Nothing changed. Everything was just business as usual. The medical establishment is choosing to ignore that study," said West, who has been interested in vaccine safety since her daughter, now 33, developed a severe case of measles after a childhood immunization.</p>
<p>Not only does West believe the H1N1 influenza vaccine would be ineffective but also that it could be dangerous due to one of the ingredients <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> has put into the adjuvant - an additive that stretches supply and boosts immunity - mixed with the antigen in a dose of its vaccine.</p>
<p>That ingredient is squalene and a quick online search tells you it is derived from fish oil and the main suspect in a government conspiracy.</p>
<p>Dr. Donald Low, microbiologist-in-chief in the department of microbiology at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, mentioned it first in the list of persistent vaccine rumours he has encountered.</p>
<p>"During the Gulf War, the soldiers were vaccinated against anthrax and then you had the Gulf War Syndrome," said Low, referring to an illness known to cause sudden bursts of violence that a Pentagon report eventually linked to exposure to chemical agents.</p>
<p>"They tried to blame that on the anthrax vaccine and claimed the anthrax vaccine had squalene in it, when in actual fact it didn't have squalene in it." Squalene, he adds, "has been in adjuvants for years and years and years and been proven safe and effective."</p>
<p>Low sighs when asked how public health officials cope while rolling out the largest immunization campaign in Canadian history.</p>
<p>"It's a real challenge," he said. "The consequence of something like that is huge, because it just adds fuel to the fire. People are on the fence about getting vaccinated and when they hear this it is enough sometimes to push them over to the non-vaccine crowd. ... It's tough."</p>

<p>Should I vaccinate my kids?</p>
<p>Oct. 28</p>
<p>I am amazed by the number of people who say the information on H1N1 and the vaccine is confusing and contradictory. People need to base their information on recognized sources such as the Health Canada website, which also includes links to provincial health websites.</p>
<p>I am appalled by the woman in Wednesday's paper who is not getting her children vaccinated because she's heard the vaccine contains aluminum and mercury. It is not documented anywhere that there is aluminum in the vaccine. As for mercury content, here is the information from Health Canada:</p>
<p>"Both vaccines contain a small amount of thimerosal. Thimerosal is a form of mercury used in the H1N1 flu vaccine to stabilize it and maintain its quality during storage. Thimerosal is a different form of mercury than the mercury known to cause health problems. The amount in the H1N1 adjuvanted flu vaccine is much less than the daily limit recommended for environmental exposure to mercury. For example, there is significantly less mercury in the vaccine than you would find in a can of tuna fish."</p>
<p>The odds may seem acceptable to you that your child won't contract H1N1 and, if they do, that they will not have a severe case. But if they are one of the unlucky ones, then the outcome can be tragic.</p>

<p>Tory heckles drown out Liberal MP's</p>
<p>flu questions, Oct. 28</p>
<p>I find it ironic that hecklers were forcibly removed from the House of Commons on Monday, yet our own elected officials are allowed to heckle and shout down one of their own who was trying to ask a serious question about H1N1 flu shots. The behaviour of some MPs is an embarrassment to all Canadians.</p>

</p>
<p>When her 17-year-old son came down with the flu, Debby Baillargeon did everything the city's health officials said to do.</p>
<p>But nothing went right. On Monday morning, her son, Adam, walked out of his fitness class at Wexford Collegiate and biked home. His head pounded and his throat felt raw. "It was torture. It made me nauseous," he said.</p>
<p>When his mom checked in on him at lunch, he had developed a fever of 103 and his whole body ached.</p>
<p>The teen took some Tylenol and slept straight into the next morning, waking intermittently to eat or take more medication. But on Tuesday, the symptoms were still there.</p>
<p>"I read all the literature and those were the prime symptoms for H1N1," she said. "Then I heard about (13-year-old Evan Frustaglio's) death, and that put me over the edge. I was scared."</p>
<p>Baillargeon called her pediatrician's office, where the receptionist advised her to take Adam to the emergency room. The advice went against what health officials were saying: Don't flood the hospitals with minor flu cases.</p>
<p>Instead, she called Telehealth Ontario. She was on hold for an hour. Finally, she pressed 1 to leave a message with a nurse. "It said: 'This mailbox is full, you can't leave a message.' It was really frustrating."</p>
<p>She went back on hold. Finally, someone answered, took her contact information and said a nurse would call back in few hours.</p>
<p>It was now 3 p.m. and her son's fever had returned. "I was tired of being jerked around. Everything was uncoordinated and I wanted to make sure he was okay," she said.</p>
<p>They went to Scarborough Grace General Hospital and stood in line to see the nurse. But there were no masks for patients, she said.</p>
<p>"He was hacking all over the place," she said. "If he did have the flu, I was worried he would give it to someone else."</p>
<p>They waited more than eight hours before being taken into a room, she said, where a doctor ran a blood test and took a chest X-ray.</p>
<p>The boy had the flu, he told her.</p>
<p>"Was it H1N1?" she asked.</p>
<p>He told her there was no way to know and scribbled a prescription for Tamiflu, an antiviral drug. They raced to a local pharmacy and picked up the medication.</p>
<p>Baillargeon is glad she took her son to the emergency room.</p>
<p>"For peace of mind, just go to the hospital," she said. "I could sleep (Tuesday) night. I felt like going to the emergency room, I did everything I could to protect my son. I did what I had to do."</p>

</div><div>945 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A23</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Does Dr. David Butler-Jones know about pregnancy brain?</p>
<p>When I was pregnant, I regularly pulled out of the <span class="companylink">Loblaws</span> parking lot with groceries on the roof of my car. I once left the house with underwear stuffed down my pant leg like a knee pad.</p>
<p>How do you think I would have followed these instructions?</p>
<p>"In the first 20 weeks of pregnancy, if you are otherwise healthy, there is no reason not to wait for the unadjuvanted vaccine when it becomes available," Canada's chief public health officer said Wednesday. You lost me at unadjuvanted.</p>
<p>No wonder pregnant women aren't walking on their swollen feet and sore ankles to the nearest H1N1 flu clinic, despite warnings that they and their growing babies are among the most at risk.</p>
<p>They haven't had a second cup of coffee in weeks. They've lain down in a dark room to soothe a headache, because the nice nurse on the Telehealth line has scared them away from Tylenol.</p>
<p>Now, there is an untested vaccine with an additive that even the public health authorities can't get straight ... and they should take it?</p>
<p>Listening to public health officials is like following the weather forecast.</p>
<p>First they said to wait for a vaccine without this adjuvant stuff, because it's never been tested on pregnant women.</p>
<p>(The adjuvant is a cocktail of fish oil, vitamin E and a non-toxic emulsifier that acts like both water and another shot in a mixed drink - it stretches the vaccine out and jolts a person's response to it, so you are more likely to develop an immunity in less time.)</p>
<p>Then they said don't wait if your belly is already whacking into things and you are into the second half of your pregnancy. Next, it was don't wait, even if you are still on the toilet, pregnancy test in hand.</p>
<p>Now, they've bought 200,000 doses without the stuff.</p>
<p>But that doesn't mean the vaccine mixed with adjuvant is not safe. It means it is safe, Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced on Tuesday, to the surprise of Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett, a doctor and former public health minister, who had the audacity to ask for a clarification in the House of Commons.</p>
<p>Which vaccine should pregnant women get, then? "Women more than 20 weeks pregnant and women in earlier stages of pregnancy with risk factors for severe disease," the press release continues, "should consider getting the adjuvanted one until the unadjuvanted one is available."</p>
<p>Consider. That's strong language for women they say are most at risk. I'm glad they aren't on the fire truck heading to my house.</p>
<p>The result: instead of protecting these women's - and their babies' - health, they're stressing them out. Even pregnant women in the health profession are confused.</p>
<p>"It's increased my stress levels," a public health official tells me. She understandably will go unnamed; it's not good policy to publicly diss your boss just before heading out on maternity leave. "I am pretty mad about the emotional and mental anxiety this has created."</p>
<p>This is what she and every worrying pregnant woman is picturing: Black and white pictures of babies born with flipper-like limbs instead of arms and legs. Their mothers took Thalidomide to quell their morning sickness. It was prescribed by doctors who assured them it was completely safe.</p>
<p>On the other side is this: Last spring, six pregnant women died in the United States after getting the swine flu. A subsequent study, by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, indicated that pregnant women who get swine flu are more likely to get really sick and die than non-pregnant women. Especially in the second half of pregnancy, women are more susceptible because their immune systems are compromised and their lungs compressed.</p>
<p>You need a degree in statistics to figure out the odds.</p>
<p>Pregnant women - like everyone else - have a 10 to 30 per cent chance of catching the H1N1 virus, says Dr. Scott Halperin, director of the Canadian Center for Vaccinology. If they get it, they have a one in 200 to 500 chance of ending up in hospital. There, the risk of miscarriage or congenital malformation is 1 in 100,000, says Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital.</p>
<p>"Being in the ICU of a hospital is not good for a baby," she says.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the theoretical risks of the vaccine and adjuvant are minor, although experts can't frame them with statistics.</p>
<p>Though medical professionals haven't tested this adjuvant on pregnant women, it was given to 39,000 people with an avian flu vaccine, with no adverse effects. Some 45 million Europeans - most of them elderly - received a similar adjuvant with their seasonal flu shot "with absolutely no reaction or adverse event reported," says McGeer.</p>
<p>Just to make sure you are confused, there is the issue of timing. Get the adjuvanted vaccine now and be immune in two weeks, since it jabs your immune system more quickly.</p>
<p>Wait till next week for the pure vaccine, and be exposed for a week longer.</p>
<p>So pregnant sisters, here's what you need to know: If you are still wearing your old jeans, your baby's organs are still forming. Wait till next week. If you feel like a beach ball, head to the clinic today.</p>
<p>Now, go have a long, warm bath.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The man, myth and mission; Comment</b>
</div><div>Don Martin    </div>

</p>
<p>Whene ver Liberals gaze longingly into their Scotch, reminiscing about those bygone days of government power and glory, they sometimes whisper the name "Peter Donolo" with mythical reverence.</p>
<p>Today we play Inside Baseball by noting that, 10 years after leaving politics for a series of patronage and polling jobs, the same Donolo who served as Jean Chretien's communications guru returns as Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff's top sidekick.</p>
<p>If the news of his return is any indication, the myth is no longer the man as he launches a mission to salvage his political alma mater from its slide toward oblivion.</p>
<p>The appointment leaked out just as Tuesday afternoon television politics shows were going to air. Confusion reigned. Liberal apologists didn't know what to say or do. The data were repeatedly denied by a communications director who is, incidentally, the partner of the chief of staff now being metaphorically thrown under Mr. Ignatieff's bus.</p>
<p>Finally, around 9:30 p.m., Mr. Ignatieff confirmed what his flack had repeatedly denied: Peter the Great Communicator was coming back. More staff changes to follow.</p>
<p>It was an inauspicious start for someone striving to bring order to communications chaos. It's also a sign of Mr. Ignatieff's ramped-up desperation that he's gassing his most loyal followers, the very people who lured him onto the magic carpet ride toward Parliament Hill, while issuing a mayday call for help from the Chretien era.</p>
<p>After all, he had already imported a tenacious partisan from Chretien's days named Warren Kinsella to run backroom operations, although his most recent brainstorm to have MP Wayne Easter ambush Conservative MPs emerging from their caucus meeting flopped spectacularly when they discovered the room was empty.</p>
<p>Still, the staff changes are a welcome indication that Mr. Ignatieff recognizes his situation is so dire that he must sacrifice diehard internal loyalty for outside adult supervision.</p>
<p>Changing a few names on the Official Opposition Leader's organization chart can only do so much to brake an astounding reversal of fortunes for Liberals that no amount of stimulus scandal seems to be impacting.</p>
<p>But Mr. Ignatieff's line of attack yesterday against what increasingly appears to be a botched swine flu immunization blitz, of which some blame clearly falls on federal shoulders, at least hit the government where it hurt.</p>
<p>Despite having six months to prepare the immunization program for a second-stage pandemic, a failure of communications is rolling out across Canada with provinces posting different rules for varying patients needlessly huddled for hours in germ-exchanging crowds.</p>
<p>This should be Mr. Ignatieff's priority issue.</p>
<p>While there's something pathetic about seeing significance in those hired to give a leader advice on where to stand, what to say and how to see with long-range vision, it's increasingly obvious Mr. Ignatieff needs professional help adjusting to life as a leader in a country he's mostly avoided.</p>
<p>There's no doubt Mr. Donolo will help his boss avoid amateur-hour mistakes ( "Stephen Harper, your time is up") and better interpret the meaning behind polls that have all the consistency of a yo-yo.</p>
<p>Peter Donolo will take no advice from me, but he should keep his leader's keynote speeches away from international trade and foreign affairs, particularly given the Conservative's "just visiting" attack ads.</p>
<p>If he can keep the Question Period focus on immunization hiccups or medical isotope shortages, the sort of tangibles that actually impact Canadians, it would connect more efficiently than selective stimulus attacks that have failed to register.</p>
<p>But if nothing else, having a proven talent who was enjoying life in a lucrative private-sector job return to stake his reputation on a long shot is a promising sign.</p>
<p>The last place any rational Liberal would settle now is in the office of a leader less popular than Stephane Dion at his worst. Mr. Donolo must see hope in what appears to be a hopeless leadership scenario.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>What Makes H1N1 Deadly; Science Of New Flu; In rare cases results in 'bad viral pneumonia'</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>1235 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>It is clear now that the vast majority of people who catch the H1N1 flu will suffer relatively mild illness and recover quickly.</p>
<p>For that small subset of otherwise healthy individuals who become desperately sick or even die, however, the blame may lie in a seemingly distinctive trait of the H1N1 virus -- an ability to bind itself to tissue deep within the lungs, causing dangerous viral pneumonia, some scientists believe.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar says the bug's reported biological attributes -- different from those of the seasonal flu -- would help explain what he has seen among dozens of critically ill H1N1 patients in the intensive-care unit of his Winnipeg hospital.</p>
<p>"It is a very different virus," he said. "It does attach to the deep lung tissue in people. When it does, it creates a very bad viral pneumonia, one of the worst we've ever seen. ... This is the sickest bunch of people I've seen, as a group."</p>
<p>Other experts speculate that deaths are occurring when the body essentially turns on itself with an extreme immune response to the virus, a phenomenon sometimes called a "cytokine storm," and often seen with seasonal flu, too. Ironically, robust young people with strong immune systems may be more susceptible to such a reaction, scientists theorize.</p>
<p>"In essence, they die because their own body, in its attempt to fight off the influenza virus, actually kills them," said Dr. Gerald Evans, the Kingston , Ont.,-based president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease.</p>
<p>"The problem is we have absolutely no way to predict who is going to have an over-exhuberant response and die of a cytokine storm and who is going to handle the virus in a nice, normal fashion."</p>
<p>But, the death of a seemingly healthy 13-year-old Toronto boy this week has underlined questions about how the new pathogen can prove so lethal for a tiny minority of patients, and fairly run of the mill for others. Dr. Evans cautions that that tragic case and the demise a few days earlier of a 10-year-old Ottawa girl should not overly alarm people.</p>
<p>"Every year, young, healthy people do die of influenza, but they never get on the front page."</p>
<p>Many questions remain, though, about the characteristics of H1N1 and why an unlucky few are felled by it.</p>
<p>Experts agree on a few of its attributes -- it is particularly contagious, a disproportionate number of young people are becoming infected by it and a small number of those young patients are getting seriously ill. A recent study of cases that ended up in Canadian ICUs found that the average age was 32. The seasonal flu seriously affects mainly the very elderly and very young.</p>
<p>Dr. Michel Laverdiere, an infectious disease specialist at Montreal's <span class="companylink">Hopital Maisonneuve-Rosemont</span>, argues that the deaths this week of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio and the Ottawa girl would rarely be seen in seasonal flu outbreaks.</p>
<p>The differences are likely a result of the fact that this is a novel flu: the first time, in fact, that the genetics of swine, bird and human influenzas have combined in one bug, he said. People over 65 seem less affected, perhaps because they were exposed to a similar virus in the 1940s or '50s and developed some immunity. The rest of the population has none.</p>
<p>A British study published last month suggests H1N1 acts differently in other ways, too. Based on unique laboratory tests, the research at Imperial College London found the new strain bound strongly to cell "receptors" found in the upper respiratory tract -- the nose, throat and upper airway -- and more weakly to receptors deep inside the respiratory tract. Seasonal viruses, on the other hand, stuck only to the upper-tract receptors.</p>
<p>"We believe this is a clue to the more serious illness in some people," Prof. Ten Feizi, who led the study, said in an interview.</p>
<p>Dr. Kumar said seasonal pneumonia tends to kill elderly or very young patients by exacerbating existing medical conditions, like the respiratory illness COPD, or causing secondary, bacterial pneumonias. He said more than 80% of deaths from H1N1 in contrast are caused by viral pneumonia.</p>
<p>Dr. Evans is less convinced by the importance of the British research, though, saying that he believes most serious cases are related to the exaggerated inflammatory response. He also notes the majority of people who have died from H1N1 worldwide had some kind of underlying health problem, though the ICU study showed that many of the problems were relatively minor, such as mild hypertension.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, what about the fact that pregnant women are so disproportionately affected by the virus?</p>
<p>That phenomenon likely stems from the fact that expectant mothers' immune systems are essentially at a reduced level, an automatic response of the body to prevent women from rejecting a fetus whose genetic makeup derives partly from someone else, said Dr. Laverdiere.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>VACCINE FAQ</p>
<p>Max Harrold, Canwest News ServiceWhat is fact and what is fiction when it comes to the H1N1 or swine flu and the vaccine? Here are a few questions with answers from Dr. Dalius Briedis, director of the clinical infectious diseases unit at the Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal, and Ariel Fenster, a chemistry professor at McGill University in Montreal.</p>
<p>Can the vaccine cause flu?</p>
<p>No. And the H1N1 vaccine is 80% to 95% effective.</p>
<p>Does the H1N1 vaccine contain harmful mercury?</p>
<p>Health Canada says thimerosal, a preservative used to stabilize and preserve the vaccine during storage, does contain mercury, albeit at a level that "is much less than the daily limit recommended for environmental exposure to mercury."</p>
<p>Is H1N1 worse than the regular flu?</p>
<p>Not for most people. "Stay home if you have a cough and a temperature over 38C," Dr. Briedis said.</p>
<p>Without seeing a doctor how can I tell what I have?</p>
<p>A flu includes a fever (temperature of 38C or higher), shaking and chills, severe muscle aches and headaches, coughing and the incapacity to go to work, Dr. Briedis said.</p>
<p>H1N1 can also be marked by a shortness of breath "like someone is strangling you," Dr. Briedis said. If that is the case, seek medical attention. Don't go to the hospital unless the symptoms, especially shortness of breath, persist.</p>
<p>How effective is handwashing against H1N1?</p>
<p>Ninety-five per cent of those who get H1N1 will get it from airborne droplets spread by infected people (likely through coughs), Dr. Briedis said. "But handwashing is great at preventing so many other things that get you sick, like cold viruses."</p>
<p>What's the point of getting vaccinated if most people will be fine after a few days sick in bed?</p>
<p>"Good question," Prof. Fenster said. "The fear is that many people will get sick around the same time.... Imagine if all at once there weren't enough nurses or bus drivers, for example."</p>
<p>When will people get it?</p>
<p>The flu generally has a six-week time frame to do its worst. Dr. Briedis said the H1N1 season is here, and it could last weeks or months longer than the regular flu season.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Zinger' coping with one personnel crisis after another Call-ups, flu menace Moose - Schneider back to the bigs, H1N1 testing necessitates line-shuffling</b>
</div><div>By Paul Wiecek    </div>

</p>
<p>So you want to be the general manager of a pro hockey team.</p>
<p>Travel, get paid to watch hockey, rub elbows with celebrity, maybe even win a championship ring -- they are all perks, to be sure.</p>
<p>And then there are the days like the one Moose GM Craig Heisinger was having on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Just two days after the Vancouver Canucks called up his top points-getter, Russian forward Sergei Shirikov -- joining the guy who used to be Heisinger's top points-getter, Austrian forward Michael Grabner, before he was also called up -- Heisinger got word from Vancouver that, 'Oh, by the way, we'll take your starting goalie, Cory Schneider, too.'</p>
<p>Add to that a pair of games beginning tonight at the MTS Centre against the Wilkes-Barre Penguins, a flu outbreak on his club that's affected six players, including the guy who was supposed to replace Shirikov, and a blizzard in Minneapolis that was preventing him from flying in a new goaltender to replace Schneider and it would have been hard to blame Heisinger yesterday if he'd been a bit short with a reporter calling for a chat.</p>
<p>And just as surprising that the general manager was, instead, the opposite of that. "I know what you're saying but it's really not as bad as you might think it would be," said Heisinger.</p>
<p>"It's part of the day-to-day business of this team and life in our league. These things run in cycles and hopefully we've gotten our cycle out of the way."</p>
<p>Hopefully is right. Because any more player losses and the Moose will be able to sell fans tickets for seats on the empty Moose bench tonight against Wilkes-Barre.</p>
<p>Not to worry, says Heisinger, a man who got his start in pro hockey as an equipment manager and seemed to regard the latest series of crises as little more than yet another of hockey's many logistical challenges.</p>
<p>Whether it's moving equipment bags or players, it all comes down to the preparation you did before the crises began, says Heisinger.</p>
<p>"We've been through this before," he says, "and one of the reasons I sleep well, regardless of what happens or what Vancouver does, is because we have a good handle on the next level of players.</p>
<p>"We're not guessing on our call-ups. We trust our own opinions."</p>
<p>The Canucks officially called up Schneider last night, an emergency replacement after Canucks starting goalie Roberto Luongo came up lame. Luongo is reported to be out at least a week with a hairline rib fracture suffered in a shot by Niklas Hagman of the Toronto Maple Leafs in a game last Saturday.</p>
<p>With the Canucks scheduled to play tonight in L.A. and Friday night in Anaheim, there's a good chance Schneider, who's been 6-3 with a .910 save percentage and a 2.41 goals-against average with the Moose, could see some NHL action.</p>
<p>It's a huge opportunity for Schneider but a giant pain in the neck for Heisinger, who was already having a long day on Wednesday courtesy of a minor flu epidemic running through his club that saw several players miss practice.</p>
<p>While six players were checked for signs of the H1N1 virus and came back negative, one player -- forward Eric Walsky -- is undergoing further testing as a precaution, partly because he is asthmatic and that places him in a potential risk group should he contract the virus.</p>
<p>Walsky's condition was of particular concern to the Moose, who just 24 hours earlier had placed him on the top line with centre Marty Murray and winger Matt Pettinger and were hoping he would step up and fill the large void on that line the departure of Shirikov to Vancouver created.</p>
<p>But such is the way things have been going for the Moose this week that Walsky promptly came up sick and the Moose weren't sure Wednesday who their top line -- or any line, for that matter -- will be tonight when they take on the Penguins.</p>
<p>paul.wiecek@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>Expect the worst</p>
<p>and you'll be OK</p>
<p>Random notes from a wild day in Mooseland Wednesday:</p>
<p>THE GOOD</p>
<p>The Moose think they have a dependable replacement for Cory Schneider, who was called up yesterday, in backup Daren Machesney. Machesney has a 1-2 record in three starts for the Moose this season, with a 2.94 goals-against average and a .901 save percentage.</p>
<p>"This is exactly why we got him in the off-season," said Moose GM Craig Heisinger.</p>
<p>Despite weather problems yesterday, the Moose were confident they would be able to fly in Rejean Beauchemin in time for tonight's game. Beauchemin, a Winnipeg native, was impressive in training camp and is 3-0 with a 1.67 goals-against average this season with the Idaho Steelheads of the East Coast Hockey League.</p>
<p>Four players who started the season with the Moose are now playing for Vancouver -- Sergei Shirokov, Michael Grabner, Alexandre Bolduc and Schneider. All of which gives hope to the Moose players still in Winnipeg. "I wouldn't say you work harder," says forward Guillaume Desbiens, "but it does give you more motivation on those days when maybe you're not feeling your best."</p>
<p>THE BAD</p>
<p>The Moose haven't exactly been prolific this season in goal-scoring as a team and the one line that was dependable -- Marty Murray, Matt Pettinger and Shirokov -- is no more with the call-up of Shirokov.</p>
<p>The Moose would like to give speedy forward Eric Walsky an audition on the top line tonight, but that will depend on Walsky getting a clean bill of health after a bout with the flu this week. The Moose had Desbiens playing on the top line Wednesday.</p>
<p>"In a perfect world," said Murray, "you'd come in and have the same linemates every day. But that's just not the way it is."</p>
<p>THE HILARIOUS</p>
<p>"I always said I'd need a case of mono to go through the team for me to get back on the power play."</p>
<p>-- 42-year-old Moose captain Mike Keane on flu outbreak that caused him to move up in practice Wednesday from his customary third line to the team's second line.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu shots in schools logical -</b>
</div><div>Editorial    </div>

</p>
<p>THE lengthy waits at the 12 H1N1 clinics established around the city by the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority may be the natural product of unusually high demand -- people at high risk of suffering from the flu were encouraged to get the shot and they showed up in droves on the first days the vaccinations were available.</p>
<p>But those lines could balloon when the H1N1 shots become available to all Manitobans in the next two or three weeks. Taking just those who are between the ages of six months and 65 years old (this particular vaccine is not approved for younger babies; the elderly are thought to have some immunity to this strain of the influenza virus) demand could triple. That's a lot of people, too many to push through the lines at the WRHA's established clinic sites in a timely manner.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Progressive Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen called on the province to bring the vaccine to children, setting up clinics in schools. But the provincial Health department has no plans at present to do so, nor does the WRHA. While saying its plans are flexible, the Health department is leaving the logistics on rolling out the vaccinations to the health authorities. They should look hard at the benefits of school-based clinics.</p>
<p>Public health officials are pinning a big piece of their plan to curb the spread of H1N1 on voluntary vaccination. Compared to some other Canadian cities, Winnipeg has been well served. But convincing people to turn out for vaccination relies heavily on making the clinics convenient and the lengthy waits seen to date would give some people, especially those with school-aged children, pause. Forcing them into a bottleneck of a few clinics is anything but convenient.</p>
<p>The flip side is that if demand for vaccination rises steeply, as it may with the deaths this week of two children in Ontario, parents will get frustrated trying to protect their children. Panic can quickly undo a pandemic plan.</p>
<p>The reliance on a few clinics around the city, operating during week days, presents real inconvenience for working adults and parents. It's tough to make a young child stand in line for hours at any time of the day. The only way to avoid the tide of people showing up in the evenings is to go during the day, which forces people to miss work and parents to pull their kids out of school, the kind of disruption pandemic plans seek to prevent.</p>
<p>Family doctors are expected to take some of the pressure off the community clinics when vaccines become available to the general public, but those offices are typically crowded.</p>
<p>Mr. McFadyen's suggestion to expand clinics to the schools presents logistical complications, the primary one being that it would require the WRHA to find more health practitioners to deliver the shots. That would mean more nurses, former nurses, other health workers and volunteers would need to step up to the job. Not an easy order to fill, but the risk of moving everyone through a limited number of community clinics is that the vaccination of hundreds of thousands of people is dragged out.</p>
<p>Manitoba is in the early days of H1N1's return, but evidence in other Canadian jurisdictions shows that it sweeps quickly through the community, worrying people. A plan to accommodate vastly more people seeking vaccination is the best means to prevent unnecessary alarm and panic.</p>

<p>Calling Gerry Delorme a giant would be stretching it.</p>
<p>Still, the province's director of disaster management looks almost big enough to carry the weight of a pandemic on his shoulders.</p>
<p>Which is what he's been doing for the last eight months.</p>
<p>Just before he and Dr. Joel Kettner walked into a news conference in a basement room of the Manitoba Legislative Building Wednesday, Delorme turned to the province's chief medical officer and put the pressure in personal perspective.</p>
<p>"This is way more complicated than a flood," Delorme told Kettner.</p>
<p>Just how complicated it is for Delorme and Kettner -- the men charged with protecting the lives of hundreds of thousands of Manitobans and deciding who goes to the front of the H1N1 vaccination line -- became even more evident to both of them this week.</p>
<p>Two Ontario kids, a boy 13 and a girl 10, died after contracting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Teenagers and school-age children aren't considered high-risk groups to be immunized first as the vaccine is gradually doled out across the country.</p>
<p>The front of the line is reserved, instead, for the likes of smaller children, women who are pregnant, the medically compromised and, for a change, for aboriginals and the homeless, who are accustomed to being society's back-of-the-line people.</p>
<p>Health-care workers have been allowed to go to the front of the line, too. Rightly so, because of their exposure to the sick and the essential service they provide during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Although not all health-care workers are necessarily seen as equal.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority has acknowledged that late last week it initially overlooked family physicians and their front-line workers when announcing who would be among the first vaccinated.</p>
<p>It was an embarrassing admission for the WRHA which, on the whole, has planned well, especially with outreach programs for the homeless.</p>
<p>Perhaps the oversight with the family physicians has something to do with institutional myopia. Family physicians, unlike hospital doctors, aren't employed by the WRHA.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason for briefly forgetting the family docs, there's no good reason. Not after having months, if not years, to plan for the pandemic.</p>
<p>It makes one wonder what else the provincial and regional heath-care decision-makers might have got wrong and may have to correct.</p>
<p>Like not using schools to vaccinate school-age children, perhaps.</p>
<p>That seemed to be what the room full of reporters wanted to ask Kettner and Delorme.</p>
<p>Delorme, for his part, said the decision to use mass vaccination clinics rather than setting up shop in schools had to do with efficiency.</p>
<p>Efficiency for the system, perhaps, but what about the children and their parents?</p>
<p>Kettner suggested that the deaths of the two Ontario children notwithstanding, there is no evidence to suggest the tragedies are any more than isolated cases. Or that school-age children are a high-risk group.</p>
<p>"We're going to follow the program until we have enough evidence to change it," Kettner told the news conference.</p>
<p>Of course it's somewhat of a moot point because right now there isn't enough vaccine in Manitoba to do all school-age kids. And they're not a priority -- except with their parents.</p>
<p>Parents like Progressive Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen, who wants the vaccination program in the schools.</p>
<p>I agree.</p>
<p>But it's not my responsibility to monitor the progress of a virus and make those complicated decisions.</p>
<p>It's people like Gerry Delorme and Joel Kettner who have to wonder, day to day, how bad will it be?</p>
<p>What's waiting round the corner?</p>
<p>And are they really ready for it?</p>
<p>After the news conference, when the rest of the reporters had hurried off to file their reports, I asked Kettner --who still works in the hospital front lines -- how he felt when he heard about the two Ontario kids who had died so unexpectedly and so swiftly.</p>
<p>This time he answered my question in a personal, more human way.</p>
<p>"You feel awful," Kettner said. "Have we got the wrong priority group? ... Are we on the right path?"</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Manitoba NDP MP Jim Maloway was among the thousands of people whose hope to get the H1N1 shot this week was dashed by long lines and confusion.</p>
<p>Lineups at Ottawa flu clinics, like those in Winnipeg and elsewhere in Canada, have ranged from two to three hours at most sites every day this week.</p>
<p>Maloway attempted to get his shot Tuesday night but the long lines meant the clinic stopped accepting patients hours before closing time to ensure they all got through.</p>
<p>Most Manitoba MPs plan to get the shot, including Conservatives Vic Toews, Shelly Glover, Rod Bruinooge, Joy Smith and James Bezan; Liberal Anita Neville; and NDP MPs Niki Ashton, Judy Wasylycia-Leis and Maloway.</p>
<p>Conservatives Merv Tweed, Candice Hoeppner, Steven Fletcher and Inky Mark could not be reached for comments or did not respond when asked.</p>
<p>NDP MP Pat Martin said he is going to "take his chances" and not get the vaccine because he doesn't like to inject himself with anything unless he absolutely must.</p>
<p>Ashton, who earlier this week was quoted in the Hill Times saying she wasn't sure yet if she would get the shot, said Wednesday she had decided to do so.</p>

<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p>No-show passengers crying the H1N1 blues won't be getting a break from major travel companies.</p>
<p>Airlines, tour operators, <span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span> and Greyhound Canada are standing pat on their rebooking policies for consumers, despite Ottawa's suggestion that cancellation rules be eased in cases of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq released travel guidelines yesterday, urging consumers sick with the flu to postpone their trips, while also recommending that the tourism industry smooth the way for journeys to be rescheduled.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada confirmed in a statement that it's “encouraging conveyance operators to develop policies that make it easy for Canadians to rebook travel for reasons of illness,” noting that many corporations already have cancellation rules in place.</p>
<p>Leading Canadian transport companies, however, are strongly recommending that consumers buy travel insurance to protect themselves from losing their money if they are forced by H1N1, or any other illness, to bow out of a vacation or business trip.</p>
<p>“The underlying implication from Ottawa is that it's difficult to rebook, and from our perspective, we don't think it is,” said <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines</span> spokesman Richard Bartrem.</p>
<p>WestJet's vacations division, for instance, will still charge a $75 change fee if a tour package is cancelled 21 days or longer before the vacation begins. If the holiday is cancelled within 21 days of the start, WestJet is on the hook for hotels and other costs, so consumers will forfeit their money unless they obtain travel insurance, Mr. Bartrem cautioned.</p>
<p>Air Canada isn't budging, either. “At this point, we have not implemented rebooking policy changes,” Air Canada spokesman Peter Fitzpatrick said. “However, we continue to monitor the situation closely and will respond appropriately to developments.”</p>
<p>On the West Coast, customers who reserve in advance but don't show up for their sailing on <span class="companylink">BC Ferries</span> will forfeit their fare, but for a standard $9 change fee, they can book different dates and preserve the ticket, said spokeswoman Deborah Marshall.</p>
<p>“How can we prove that somebody didn't take a trip because it's H1N1 versus deciding not to travel because of the common cold?” she said.</p>
<p>Tour operator Transat and online travel site FlightNetwork.com both stressed that trip insurance remains the best route to go for financial protection against cancelled journeys due to sickness.</p>

<p>After a full day spent on Mother Web, trying to figure out why so many Canadians are afraid of the H1N1 vaccine and not planning to get it – as per the online poll conducted by Strategic Counsel for The Globe and published this Monday – my favourite discovery is an innocuous sounding sheet called Vaccination 101.</p>
<p>I found it on the Personocratia site, which features someone named Ghis, who used to be a Quebec doctor before she lost her marbles (and her licence to practise, for life) and took up the principles of Applied Idessic Consciousness.</p>
<p>What sounds at first blush like it might be a rudimentary pro-and-con discussion is in fact a two-page number that describes the vaccines as “biological weapons of mass destruction for targeted populations,” warns they may include microchips to “facilitate mind control at a distance,” and, best of all, “because of their neurotoxic effects,” announces that they “produce psychopaths.”</p>
<p>Holy Mary Mother of God: It is a miracle that anyone in the country is getting the damn shot, let alone lining up for it.</p>
<p>(This is where protocol dictates I must insert the standard “I don't hate the Web” disclaimer. Consider it done.)</p>
<p>Obviously – I pray it is obvious – Ghis is not an authoritative source for H1N1 information or anything else but idessity, which she invented, and good on her. But she is not alone out there on the fringes.</p>
<p>Bill Maher, the perfectly presentable host of HBO's Real Time, is out there too on the subject of vaccines.</p>
<p>At 3.37 p.m. on Sept. 27, he now famously Twittered, “If u get a swine flu shot ur an idiot.”</p>
<p>On Oct. 9, he had a seven-minute on-air chat with Bill Frist, a former Republican senator, about the efficacy of the new vaccine, which began with Mr. Maher affecting puzzlement that conservatives like Mr. Frist, with their suspicions about big government, would embrace letting “the government stick a disease in your arm…. I don't trust the government, especially with my health,” Mr. Maher said, to cheers from his audience.</p>
<p>Mr. Frist mentioned the case of a healthy 30-year-old man who had recently entered hospital and died from swine flu and who would be alive, he said, if he'd had the vaccine. “That's an anecdotal story,” said Mr. Maher. “It's not typical. Let's face it, this is not a very serious flu.”</p>
<p>Alas for Mr. Maher, in this particular battle of the Bills, Mr. Frist had the edge – he's a medical doctor. Mr. Maher is a comedian: Who are you going to believe?</p>
<p>It should be easy but it never is, not with the uber democracy ushered in by the Web, where it is written that a) there are no baseline facts, only opinions; b) everyone is entitled to an opinion and to express it loudly; c) all opinions are equal and d) the informed opinion, i.e. Mr. Frist's, is given no more weight than the uninformed one, i.e. Mr. Maher's or even the lunatic one, i.e. Ghis's.</p>
<p>By late yesterday, for instance, if you typed “flu vaccine” into the <span class="companylink">Google</span> search engine, one of the first results, No. 2 I think, was entitled “Do Not Take a Swine Flu Vaccine!” written by one Dr. Patricia A. Doyle (she appears to be, by her own reckoning, a veterinarian at the esteemed University of West Indies, but even this wasn't immediately verifiable), whose short rant was full of such scientific gems as: “I feel the vaccine weakens our immune system.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the same search uncovered, in the Top 10, an item entitled “Swine Flu Vaccine Linked to Paralysis,” by one F. William Engdahl, which blew up in hysterical fashion an already overblown story from earlier this year in the Daily Mail, which quoted a leaked warning letter from professor Elizabeth Miller of the British Health Protection Agency reminding British neurologists that the swine-flu vaccine was in 1976 linked to Guillain-Barre Syndrome and withdrawn.</p>
<p>(This is accurate, in that it happened, but many studies since have found no causal link between GBS and flu vaccines, and no cases of GBS in clinical trials of the H1N1 vaccines.)</p>
<p>In fact, Dr. Miller had also told the Mail, “We are not expecting a link to the vaccine but a link to disease, which would make having the vaccine even more important.” Dr. Miller, a serious scientist, also recently presented a paper to the U.S. Congress in which she and another researcher confirmed their study shows no link between the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine and autism.</p>
<p>Both Ms. Doyle and Mr. Engdahl appeared on the Global Research site, which purports to be an independent think tank of some sort, but appears to be home to conspiracy theorists the world over.</p>
<p>And then there is the Health Ranger, a guy named Mike Adams, and his NaturalNews site, also in the Top 10. Mr. Adams quotes the Dalai Lama, Martin Luther King Jr. and Mahatma Gandhi a lot, and his Health Ranger Habits include “no visits to M.D.s or western medical doctors,” no prescription drugs or pharmaceuticals and no “following the … ridiculous food guide” health agencies advocate. He is 35 and to judge by the many self-portraits on the site, a looker, which may be why a half-million people are reading him a month, as he says they are.</p>
<p>Mr. Adams is quoted on another “natural flu prevention” site run by Richard Seah, a “photographic artist, writer, journalist, web designer and teacher of natural health and macrobiotics” who is based in Singapore. He begins from a position of skepticism about what he calls “the germ theory of disease” and appears to believe that H1N1 is man-made.</p>
<p>The Strategic Counsel survey showed that only 49 per cent of Canadians wanted the new flu shot. Opposition is greatest in those under 34, those most likely, in other words, to turn to the Web for information, where the reputable and the scandalous and the … idessic are treated with scrupulous equality. Some of the suspicious 51 per cent are in my own family. They feel the vaccine may be bad; they doubt the traditional sources. They prefer the likes of Dr. Maher, Dr. Adams and Ghis. It is to weep.</p>

<p>The death of 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio from the H1N1 flu virus hit hard for one Toronto Maple Leafs player.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Leafs forward Jason Blake was new to the team and the city and struggling to deal with the news he had chronic myelogenous leukemia, a rare but treatable form of cancer. However, the little boy next door who loved hockey always made him smile.</p>
<p>“I can't imagine what they are going through,” Blake said yesterday morning of his former Etobicoke neighbours, the Frustaglio family, two days after Evan died from the flu. “They are a great family with great kids. Evan was a hell of a hockey player.</p>
<p>“It's tough. My prayers and thoughts go with them.”</p>
<p>Blake, his wife Sara and their three children lived in the house next door to the Frustaglios for the 2007-08 season, his first in Toronto after signing a five-year, $20-million (U.S.) contract with the NHL team. It was a difficult year for Blake, as his illness weighed heavily on his play. While the disease was treatable with regular medication, Blake went from 40 goals the season before with the New York Islanders to 15 with the Leafs.</p>
<p>Things were a little better at home, though, as Paul and Ann-Marie Frustaglio welcomed the Blake family to the neighbourhood.</p>
<p>“We became good friends with them,” Blake recalled as the Leafs got ready to play the Dallas Stars last night. “They showed us the ropes when we got to town. They were our next-door neighbours, their kids came over and played driveway hockey. We had dinners together.</p>
<p>“It's a tough deal.”</p>
<p>Blake remembers Evan as in irrepressible child with a deep passion for hockey.</p>
<p>“He was driven to play hockey; he loved hockey,” he said. “He was outside in his driveway shooting pucks constantly. Pucks were always flying in my yard.</p>
<p>“This is just unbelievable. It's such a tragedy.”</p>
<p>The spread of the H1N1 virus is becoming an increasing concern for NHL teams. Three players were diagnosed with the flu strain, commonly called swine flu, in the last two days: Peter Budaj of the Colorado Avalanche, Quintin Laing of the Washington Capitals and Ladislav Smid of the Edmonton Oilers. Dustin Boyd of the Calgary Flames has also been sidelined by a flu bug and didn't play against the Colorado Avalanche last night.</p>
<p>Since hockey players come into contact with more people than the norm because of the nature of their work, the medical staff on each team issued guidelines for the players to follow.</p>
<p>“We put our trust in the team doctors to look after us,” Leafs defenceman Mike Komisarek said. “Obviously, during the season, germs are flying all over the place. I think washing hands, things like that, [are the best precautions].</p>
<p>“At the end of the day you put your faith in the team doctors to give you the proper care and advice that you need. We've had conversations. If they tell us to take medication or vaccine that is going to help us and not knock us out for a week or so, I'm going to take that shot.”</p>
<p>Even though the flu has hit other teams, Komisarek and his teammates say they are not obsessing about it.</p>
<p>“I don't think you can worry about that,” Komisarek said. “You just keep a cool head and take the necessary precautions to make sure we don't come across anything like that.”</p>
<p>Leafs head coach Ron Wilson said his players have not had the H1N1 vaccination yet because it has not been made available to the team. He also said there is not a lot teams can do aside from following the simple advice of washing their hands frequently.</p>
<p>“I don't know if you can do anything, unless you live in a bubble, to avoid getting [sick],” the coach said. “We have to fly on planes, which is one of the worst things you can do, where you share the air with people.</p>
<p>“The shots haven't been made available to us yet. You just cross your fingers and hope people don't get sick.”</p>

<p>Peterborough, Ont. -- It's not like Canada's public health officials don't have their hands full with H1N1, but I have to ask: Is there a vaccine available to protect against the sort of arrogant condescension demonstrated by Juliet Guichon and Ian Mitchell (Refusing To Get Vaccinated Is Selfish – Oct. 27)?</p>
<p>Thanks to them, I'm getting a headache trying to reconcile my selfish refusal to roll up my sleeve with my firm belief in the freedom of choice. Ecologist Garrett Hardin made many astute observations in “the tragedy of the commons,” one being that administrators are in no position to “evaluate the morality of acts.” I reckon that includes the more-righteous-than-thou administrators in our bioethics departments.</p>

<p>Vancouver -- Folks who boast “I've never had a flu shot and I've never had the flu” (Swine Flu Feud – letter, Oct. 28) are as misguided as those who refuse to wear seatbelts and boast they've never had an accident. The true risk to an individual of rare but nasty outcomes from refusing to receive protective immunization for a vaccine-preventable disease can only be determined by looking at much larger populations than oneself or one's family. It's not merely selfish to refuse immunization – it's deceptive and short-sighted.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu-fighting plan staying pat - Province open to immunizations in schools once it has enough vaccine</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen and Carol Sanders   </div>
<div>886 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba is now open to the possibility of immunizing children in the province's schools once it has enough of the limited vaccine on hand.</p>
<p>But for the time being, Manitoba's chief provincial health officer, Dr. Joel Kettner, is sticking to the current game plan of vaccinating those already chosen to be at the highest risk of severe illness and death from H1N1.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean we won't change," Kettner said. "We'll change as soon as it seems reasonable to do that."</p>
<p>He said plans could change quickly depending on the spread of the flu and the province's stockpiles of the vaccine. "One thing we really don't want to do, and I don't think Manitobans would thank us if we did, was every time there was a single event, that we changed our program," he said. "I don't think it would be helpful. I don't think it would be wise."</p>
<p>Kettner said children are not on the priority list because there is not enough vaccine to immunize them.</p>
<p>He said what it comes down to is using the limited amount of vaccine to the maximum benefit by immediately giving it to those most likely to fall seriously ill, needing intensive care treatment in hospital, and those who could die.</p>
<p>"We prioritized groups according to expected benefit," he said.</p>
<p>Kettner has never previously talked publicly about schools being on the radar screen when it comes to the province's vaccination plans.</p>
<p>But the question of starting a school-based immunization program comes after the deaths of two Ontario children from the H1N1 flu. Evan Frustaglio, a 13-year-old hockey player from the Toronto area, died Monday barely a day after falling sick. Ten-year-old Vanetia Warner of Cornwall died Saturday after being ill for several days.</p>
<p>Kettner said there is no trigger point to when the province will change its vaccination plan and take its immunization program to schools. Many schools in the United States launched their H1N1 vaccination programs this week with others starting next week.</p>
<p>He said the province's current policy of immunizing those most at-risk will change "in a day" if enough evidence comes out that children five to 18 should be vaccinated quickly.</p>
<p>He said more has to be determined about the two deaths in Ontario before any decision is made to change the vaccination strategy.</p>
<p>For the time being, that means teenagers will not be added to Manitoba's vaccine priority list.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar, infectious disease expert with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, said other jurisdictions inoculate children first because they tend to spread the flu.</p>
<p>"They inoculate all the school-age children because they tend to be incubators," he said. "That slows things down, and gives them time to inoculate everyone else."</p>
<p>But he said Canada could see more deaths in children if there is not good vaccine penetration.</p>
<p>"Different jurisdictions use different strategies," he said, adding vaccinating the most-at-risk is a valid approach.</p>
<p>"There's a big misconception that the public has," Kumar said. "They think this is the same influenza we've seen over the last 30 or 40 years. Two or three times a century, the flu undergoes a major shift. What we've gotten used to doesn't apply anymore. It's a different virus."</p>
<p>Instead of just killing the old and the sick, it hits the young and the healthy, often people ages 10 through 50, said Kumar.</p>
<p>"It kills young people in the prime of life because it goes to the lungs. It can go to the heart and cause a rhythm disturbance and sudden death, which may have happened to the young fellow who died in Ontario. It can go to the brain."</p>
<p>Manitoba Progressive Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen called on the province to consider stepping up its H1N1 vaccination program by taking it to the province's schools.</p>
<p>McFadyen said the province and its heath officials should be doing more to let parents know what they can do to protect their children.</p>
<p>"As somebody who has a five-year-old and a seven-year-old, it's a live issue for discussion with our family and I think it's certainly an issue for many families around Manitoba," he said.</p>

<p>School absentee levels</p>
<p>THE majority of school divisions in Manitoba, including the northern Frontier School Division and all Winnipeg school divisions, reported normal absentee levels Wednesday.</p>
<p>Divisions post daily school absenteeism on their websites: www.edu.gov.mb.ca/k12/schools/schooldivmap.html[http://www.edu.gov.mb.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/k12/schools/schooldivmap.html].</p>
<p>When a report of unusual absenteeism is received, the school contacts public health for advice. Manitoba Health will not identify the presence of H1N1 in any community unless there is a compelling public health reason to do so.</p>

<p>North Bay, Ont. -- You ask in your editorial, “Could you live with yourself if your unvaccinated child died of swine flu?” What are you suggesting bereaved parents do? Are you saying we can somehow guarantee life and health to our children? My first child died of a sudden respiratory infection 13 years ago, and I have lived with myself as best I could – I might even say – in his honour.</p>

<p>Manitoba's pro and amateur sports teams are trying to play it safe when it comes to the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The Manitoba Moose put in place just this week a new policy that removes all towels from the players' bench. Players will now be expected to wipe their sweat off with their jerseys.</p>
<p>Six players are currently battling flu symptoms, an outbreak that came just two days after the team returned from a nine-day road trip. All six were checked by doctors on Tuesday and all came back negative for H1N1.</p>
<p>But one player, Eric Walsky, was undergoing further testing as a precaution, simply because Walsky also has asthma.</p>
<p>"We're paying a little more attention to these things," said Moose head coach Scott Arniel.</p>
<p>"When someone said they had a cold, we might have blown it off. Now we're paying more attention to these things... There's probably a little more care being taken," he said.</p>
<p>"It's making sure the guys have their own water bottles, it's not using towels... It's making sure that wherever they go and whatever they have contact with, whether it's the bikes or exercise equipment, everything gets wiped down. It's the hand sanitizers that are always available," Arniel said on the eve of two home games starting tonight against the Wilkes-Barre Penguins.</p>
<p>"...When they're feeling any kind of symptoms, they need to see (Moose trainer Rob Millette) right away...Trying to really nip it in the bud before it becomes a problem."</p>
<p>The Bombers say they're just sticking to their old game plan: keeping it clean.</p>
<p>"Quite frankly we haven't changed a whole lot of what we've been doing before," said Bombers athletic therapist Al Couture.</p>
<p>"Sanitation was a high priority for us every season. We use the same ozone machine the Moose use. Our water bottles go in it, our training room, locker room and equipment room are cleaned throughout the day and our players are instructed to wash their hands, as they've always been."</p>
<p>High school athletes, meanwhile, are keeping it clean -- and friendly.</p>
<p>They're advised to use their own water bottles and towels, wash their hands before games and practices -- and during, if possible -- but there is no need to stop shaking hands, says Morris Glimcher, executive director of the Manitoba High Schools Athletic Association.</p>
<p>"We're not going to make you shake hands," said Glimcher, but the MHSAA does not believe it is necessary to stop shaking hands, as long as students are cleaning their hands thoroughly and regularly.</p>
<p>"We have guidelines on our website, which I circulated to (school division) superintendents last week," Glimcher said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"A lot of school divisions have their own regulations. School divisions, it's their students and their schools, not our students."</p>
<p>Glimcher said the MHSAA will further discuss H1N1 measures when its board meets Monday.</p>
<p>High school volleyball, hockey and football are well underway and basketball will start soon.</p>
<p>Glimcher said the MHSAA has not yet addressed how schools should handle activities such as volleyball and basketball, in which all the players from both teams as well as officials regularly handle the same ball.</p>
<p>Maybe, he said, there should be hand sanitizers in the gym, and everyone should wash and sanitize at the start of games and practices and again at halftime: "My gut answer is that would make sense," he said.</p>
<p>When schools go away to tournaments, said Glimcher, bring your own sanitizers, towels and water bottles: "Don't rely on the facilities, bring your own."</p>

<p>Blame the riders</p>
<p>I use the city buses all the time. For the most part I find them fairly clean, especially considering the high volume of usage. Many times I have seen the driver picking up litter and sweeping the floor during waits at timing points.</p>
<p>Most of the drivers are friendly and helpful, especially to the disabled.</p>
<p>Customers, on the other hand, can be rude and careless, refusing to share seats, leaving behind empty or partially empty food and drink containers, used tissues, etc.</p>

<p>Re: Jordan, Israel adrift (Oct. 27). I was sad to read about the cooling relations between Israel and Jordan. The Jordanians should have been just as much against terrorism as were the Israelis and hence it should have been interpreted as a friendly action when two Mossad agents entered Jordan with Canadian passports to try to kill Israel's top wanted terrorist, Mash'al. Every country must do what it feels is right when trying to eliminate a terrorist who is constantly giving orders to murder its citizens.</p>
<p>Although this peace treaty does not live up to its capacity in terms of alleviating burdens from the Jordanians, surely they must realize, any way they want to look at it, peace is always better than war. War decimates. The Israelis must get off their butts and try to break the ice.</p>

<p>Die at home</p>
<p>The public is being strongly advised to beware of swine flu symptoms such as high fever, difficulty breathing, vomiting. Prevalent advice is to go to an emergency department of your hospital immediately. Will most people heed this advice? Probably not, as most of us have sat in the waiting room at most emergency rooms for over eight hours without being seen. Do you really want to die in the emergency waiting room? No, most of us would rather suffer in the comfort of our own homes. I, for one, would not want to wait in some emergency room while I am suffering nausea and fever.</p>

<p>No more harems</p>
<p>Re: Defining Polygamy's place in law (Oct. 26). Those hundreds of British Columbia residents who have been begging successive B.C. attorneys general to charge the polygamist elders of Bountiful with contravening the law against polygamy as well as the law against the sexual exploitation of minors, welcome this move by Attorney General Mike de Jong. For far too long, the B.C. government has ignored the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which Canada has already ratified and which states polygamy contravenes women's equality rights and also harms their children. For too long they have ignored the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which Canada has already ratified and which states that everyone has the freedom to practise their religion, but only to that point where those practices begin to contravene the rights of others. Most of all, the B.C. government has ignored sections 15 and 28 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms, which guarantee women equality with men. Women in particular will be asking for intervenor status in the B.C. Supreme Court when these international conventions, plus sections 15 and 28 of the Charter, will be quoted. There is no place in First-World Canada, where everyone is guaranteed equality, for the Third-World practice of collecting women as concubines in harems.</p>

<p>Refuge in Kapyong</p>
<p>Regarding your story about immigrants coming to Canada and then living in poverty (Refugees, immigrants in poverty, Free Press, Oct. 22). The story focused on a family from Sudan who came to Canada with hope for a better life, only to end up living in poverty, with cramped conditions often in crime infested areas. Welcome to Canada indeed. At the same time, there are perfectly good houses sitting empty on Kenaston Boulevard with Kapyong Barracks nearby. Having decent housing with opportunities for safe recreation is the dream these immigrants likely imagined when they left their often war-torn countries. However, the reality of coming to Canada has for many been quite the opposite. This is unlikely to change due mostly to the "not in my backyard" mentality of some residents residing in the surrounding Kenaston neighbourhoods. As for the reader who suggested that Kapyong be turned into a park, your idea is quite frankly insulting to those who struggle for a better life, which includes adequate and safe housing.</p>

<p>Clean, not sterile</p>
<p>Peter Marykuca's letter (Spreading filth, Oct. 27) is indicative of the ridiculous mass phobia against "germs," which has been engineered by the advertising industry to sell disinfectants, cleaning agents and "preventive" medicines. The industry has also made sunshine a deadly threat and made fortunes selling sun-block goop. The result is that the people who have bought into this anti-germ and anti-sun cult have compromised immune systems and therefore have a need for all of the medication which is being peddled by the same industry.</p>
<p>People have been spreading manure on the fields from time immemorial, without any catastrophic results. When I was on the China station, in the Royal Navy, our cooks were instructed to wash all fresh vegetables in potassium permanganate, because the Chinese market gardeners used night-soil as fertilizer. We suffered no ill effects, nor did the gardeners who were applying the fertilizer.</p>
<p>If people would just get their 15 minutes per day of sunshine and simply keep their homes clean, but not sterile, they would be able to fight off infections without chemicals.</p>

<p>Executive producer, Listen Up TV</p>
<p>The lack of trust in our nation over the H1N1 vaccine is significant, so much so it looks like a national crisis of disbelief: It appears we are doubtful of Health Canada's request that everyone needs to get a pandemic shot.</p>
<p>With our top health agency facing its largest test of confidence, enter the Church. Uninvited, but surprisingly welcomed, a Faith Emergency Preparedness Initiative in Calgary is helping churches teach followers why they need to get vaccinated, and what they can do to care for ailing neighbours.</p>
<p>Although I am an optimist, my indomitability doesn't ignore the Canadian Influenza Pandemic Plan forecast: If H1N1 reaches worst-case scenario, 4.5 to 10 million Canadians will be too sick to work. Do the math and you know we are going to need all the patience and kindness we can muster, especially if we realize too late that far fewer people would've been sick had we only believed we needed the vaccine.</p>
<p>What a dilemma our secular nation faces – the Church is moving where the State needs help. No need to panic, though, it's likely an isolated initiative owned by Calgary's Bible Belt, but it is a model that has churches across the nation talking about what their role should be in serving the country during pandemic.</p>
<p>Calgary's Faith Emergency Preparedness initiative began when Marg Pollon, a retired lab technician, pulled together a coalition of 19 leaders from public, private and faith groups to prepare for H1N1. The group created a finely tuned Church Community Co-ordination Centre, which squats on free space in the basement office of a Lutheran church. From here, Ms. Pollon oversees a wall of maps that shows how Calgary's four quadrants have had churches flagged for readiness, with a lead church selected for each subdivision. The group booked clergy into seminars with Alberta Health Services and medical experts in order to learn about the vaccine, and how to get church buildings and parishioners ready to help.</p>
<p>“Churches have facilities that might be available for childcare, or assessment clinics, for vaccination centres, a kitchen that's usually or often of a commercial standard so facilities can be available. But probably more important – people,” said Wayne Elford, a retired University of Calgary epidemiologist who works with the coalition.</p>
<p>The coalition wants people to activate their understanding that faith prompts good deeds. Their plan spells it out: Should a flu victim need a grocery run, someone to walk the dog, or help to get the kids to hockey, that help will be as close as the phone number of the local church (which is posted on a door hanger that churches are distributing in their neighbourhoods). If you've had cancer and belong to a church, you know that such help is already available. But the H1N1 plan is to open up that sort of neighbourliness as a citywide resource.</p>
<p>Are you more likely to go out and get vaccinated if your pastor tells you to? Absolutely. If you're still in the pews after all these years of church decline in Canada, you're there because you've found the information from the pulpit is trustworthy for living. Clergy are the people who teach how to navigate what you can't see. Fear is unseen. So, too, is trust.</p>
<p>When a pastor does advise that H1N1 vaccine is needed, they use the same tools as when teaching on the spiritual dynamics of fear. They will have studied and listened to the best educated sources on H1N1, examined the experience and then counselled to trust. There also will be prayer, as those who do believe God cares for our lives would request wisdom and protection for the days ahead.</p>
<p>It's the first time Canada has had to launch a massive inoculation into a postfaith culture. When polls show at least half of us refuse to believe Health Canada is watching out for our best interests, it could be that the government is dealing with a virus of doubt that has no quick cure.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canada, U.S. spark ethical debate with different approaches</b>
</div><div>CARLY WEEKS   </div>

</p>
<p>The widely divergent approaches taken by Canada and the United States on the H1N1 pandemic strategy and vaccine rollout are part of an enormous public-health experiment whose outcome is impossible to predict.</p>
<p>The United States has opted for unadjuvanted vaccines while the bulk of H1N1 vaccine distributed in Canada will contain immune-boosting adjuvants. South of the border, health officials are already dealing with a vaccine shortage as Canada prepares to begin inoculating the public. U.S. President Barack Obama has declared the virus a national emergency, while Prime Minister Stephen Harper has so far remained near the sidelines to allow public-health officials to advise citizens.</p>
<p>As the H1N1 virus becomes more widespread across North America, the differing national strategies are sparking debate and raising ethical questions about which country is taking the correct approach. It may be tempting to point fingers at this early stage, but health experts and government officials say it will be too early to draw any conclusions until well after the pandemic is over.</p>
<p>Vaccination strategy</p>
<p>U.S. officials opted for an H1N1 vaccine made without adjuvants, which is now a household term across Canada.</p>
<p>Adjuvants are substances that help boost the immune response of individuals receiving the vaccine. But the adjuvant being used in the H1N1 vaccine has not been approved by health officials in the United States, so it is not being added to the vaccine there.</p>
<p>There have been concerns that vaccines containing an adjuvant could cause Gulf War syndrome, a mysterious illness suffered by many Persian Gulf war veterans, typified by symptoms such as fatigue and loss of muscle control. But there is no scientific evidence to support that theory.</p>
<p>Some previous studies, involving rodents, have suggested that certain adjuvants may cause autoimmune disorders. However, health officials say the specific adjuvant being added to the H1N1 vaccine now being distributed across Canada has been used in Europe for many years, tested on tens of thousands of people and been found to be safe.</p>
<p>Although any vaccine comes with risks, they are “infinitesimally small” while the risks from influenza are “far, far higher,” said Anand Kumar, a specialist in critically ill patients with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority and an associate professor of critical care and infectious disease at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>“The risk-benefit here is so incredibly in favour of getting vaccinated it's not even worth considering adjuvant or no adjuvant,” Dr. Kumar said in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>Vaccine supply</p>
<p>But adjuvants do not just boost the immune response. They also allow vaccine makers to use less antigen, the active ingredient in vaccines, meaning that they can produce significantly more vaccine – four to five times more – than would be possible without adjuvants. It's a critical point because it allows makers to produce large amounts of vaccine quickly as the virus spreads throughout a country. The necessity of being able to produce significant quantities of vaccine rapidly hit home this week as reports of major shortfalls in the United States began to emerge.</p>
<p>U.S. officials had said 40 million doses would be available by the end of October, but this week, less than 23 million were ready. The shortage is due primarily to manufacturer difficulty in producing the vaccine.</p>
<p>A front-page New York Times article yesterday described how public-health officials are having to act as “swine flu police,” turning away elderly people who are not part of the risk groups being targeted for early vaccination. It also suggests that news of the shortage has led some Americans to beg or lie about being pregnant or having an underlying health condition, such as asthma, just to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>Weeks ago, Canadian public-health officials were under fire after reports that other countries, such as the United States, would have the H1N1 vaccine before Canada.</p>
<p>But now, it appears that the use of adjuvants has put the delivery of vaccine across this country on track.</p>
<p>“It looked initially like we were perhaps going to be too late,” Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research Chair in public-health policy at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. “But in retrospect it looks like we may have actually made the right call.”</p>
<p>communication strategy</p>
<p>This past weekend, Mr. Obama declared swine flu a U.S. national emergency, a designation that allows hospitals to take certain measures, such as setting up alternative sites, in order to speed treatment. That designation is part of an overarching communication strategy that is being used south of the border, said Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion.</p>
<p>“The U.S. approach has been far more aggressive,” Dr. Gardam said.</p>
<p>By contrast, Mr. Harper has taken a more back-seat approach. When asked by reporters earlier this month if he planned on getting vaccinated, he said he would if it was recommended by health officials – a comment some critics said added to the confusion.</p>
<p>Instead of declaring a state of emergency, federal health officials have been trying to encourage Canadians to get vaccinated while emphasizing the need to wash hands often, avoid coughing or sneezing into the air and staying home when sick.</p>
<p>“Despite all of the accusations of Canada hyping this, Canada has actually been pretty cool about it,” Dr. Gardam said.</p>
<p>But a major part of the reason for a less-aggressive public campaign is that the hands of Canadian health officials have been tied, according to Dr. Wilson. They could not encourage the public to become inoculated until the H1N1 vaccine was approved in Canada, which occurred last week. But even then, health officials are being careful about what they say because they are focusing preliminary efforts on protecting vulnerable risk groups such as young children, pregnant women and people with certain medical conditions.</p>
<p>“They still can't be totally saying everyone needs it right away because they've actually asked non-high-risk people to defer the vaccine,” Dr. Wilson said.</p>
<p>But as more doses are delivered and vaccination clinics open to the general public in coming days and weeks, he suspects Canadian health experts and government officials will change their tune and perhaps adopt the U.S. tone.</p>
<p>“When they have enough, they're going to definitely be out there saying, ‘Everyone should get this,' ” Dr. Wilson said.</p>

<p>Bronwyn Daigle's job as a receptionist at a popular Ottawa yoga studio involves one chore that “sucks,” she says.</p>
<p>But the smelly task sure makes her popular among Rama Lotus regulars in this era of unease over the spread of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>“People have been asking a lot more if we clean mats between use,” she says, “which of course we do.”</p>
<p>Normally, gym rats try not to imagine all the sweaty body parts that may have touched a dumbbell – and reach for it anyway.</p>
<p>But warnings about the rapid spread of swine flu have ushered in a new ick-factor at exercise facilities across the country.</p>
<p>Hockey players are hoarding their water bottles. High fives are being replaced by fist bumps. And communal towels are being eyed extra closely on the bench.</p>
<p>“There's always the guy that wipes his face with the visor towel,” says Grant Breen, who plays twice weekly in a men's recreational hockey league in Calgary.</p>
<p>Such changes aren't only being seen in beer leagues, of course.</p>
<p>NBA star LeBron James didn't get any sympathy from teammates when he came back to work after spending two days in bed with an illness thought to be H1N1.</p>
<p>“You come back around and everyone is like, ‘Ugh, you got the cooties,' ” Mr. James told reporters. “They don't want to be around you.”</p>
<p>Canada's Olympic athletes are being urged by the team's chief medical officer, Bob McCormack, not to shake hands with competitors at the Games in February. Instead, they're being told to fist bump.</p>
<p>And in youth sports leagues across the country, officials are urging children to take precautions. The issue became particularly salient this week when a 13-year-old Toronto hockey player died from H1N1 a day after he began feeling ill at a tournament in London, Ont.</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> memorial website for Evan Frustaglio has been flooded with condolence messages.</p>
<p>A few parents are wondering whether to pull their children out of competition, including Stew Beckett, whose 13-year-old son Jesse played baseball against Evan.</p>
<p>“We've been talking about this for the last couple days,” Mr. Beckett said in an interview. “Do we quarantine ourselves? What do you do?”</p>
<p>While some large fitness chains have put hand-sanitizer stations in their facilities, the community gym where Jesse exercises and swims has not. Mr. Beckett has made sure Jesse goes in well armed.</p>
<p>“We give him one of those big [water] jugs, and we tell him all the time that he doesn't share. Not to be mean, but you just don't know right now.”</p>
<p>Coaches like Jeff Schneider of Calgary are giving young players the same message. He's brought in tape and markers so his players can identify their water bottles, and encouraged the league's other coaches to follow new recommendations from Hockey Canada.</p>
<p>Sharing gear is out; extra hand sanitizer and fist bumps are in.</p>
<p>Ironically, Mr. Schneider says, those rules weren't exactly top of mind when he and his team gathered recently for their Friday-night hockey game. Twenty guys showed up with only two water bottles to go around.</p>
<p>His friend, Mr. Breen, says most guys aren't worried because the risk of transmission seems minimal.</p>
<p>“I haven't had too much issue sharing water bottles. I don't stick my lips all over it.”</p>
<p>Besides, he says, “there's not a lot of hugging in men's hockey.”</p>
<p>Mark Starkey, head of the Vancouver Metro Basketball League, says he hasn't sent out notices regarding H1N1 because none of his 200 players have been sick, according to his attendance sheets.</p>
<p>“We got hit a bit last week because Steve Nash was in town playing against the [Portland] Trail Blazers,” he said. “Attendance dropped there, but it wasn't from H1N1.”</p>
<p>Mark Bury of Toronto, who plays pick-up basketball once a week, says the fears seem overblown.</p>
<p>“I try to be careful in terms of washing my hands. But I don't know if I would think about it any more than that.”</p>
<p>H1N1 has affected his sporting life in one frustrating way, however: His regular Wednesday-night basketball game has been cancelled for two months so health officials can use the gym to administer vaccine to the public.</p>

<p>During commercials breaks in Survivor last Thursday night, Danielle Donders was anxiously hashing out the risks with her husband, Mark Renaud, drifting from “maybe” to “yes” to “maybe” again. By Monday, however, the numbing statistics had morphed into enough real cases that Ms. Donders's mind was made up. Yesterday, the Barrhaven, Ont., mother packed up snacks and the portable DVD player and went to stand in line with her three young children to get them the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>“It was really the personal stories that decided things, and the fact that I know someone who went to a funeral for a little girl this week,” she says, referring to 10-year-old Vanetia Warner, who died of the flu in an Ottawa hospital. “Picturing my not-quite two-year-old on a respirator was enough to do it for me.”</p>
<p>Across the country, as clinics finally launch Canada's vaccination program, parents are agonizing over whether to give their children the needle. Fretting over the flu has surely become as pandemic as the virus itself, with parents reporting feeling both swamped by information and confused on facts.</p>
<p>A survey released Monday found that opposition to the vaccine has grown sharply – with 51 per cent of Canadians saying they don't plan on rolling up their sleeves for it. And while the death of two otherwise healthy children this week may have clarified the debate for some parents – heightening the “towering fear of ‘what ifs,' ” as Ms. Donders put it – in many households the conversation continues.</p>
<p>In most cases, it is the mom carrying the weight of the final say.</p>
<p>“Everybody's in such a state about it,” says Kerry Sauriol, a full-time Vancouver mother with three children under 7. “There's so much confusion out there. It's just crazy.”</p>
<p>Over breakfast and between bedtime responsibilities, Ms. Sauriol and her husband, Patrick, have had random exchanges about the vaccine – with Mr. Sauriol's initial reaction being opposed, and his wife wanting to research it more. But, after news reached his workplace that Evan Frustaglio, a 13-year-old Toronto hockey player, had died from flu complications, he moved closer to the pro-vaccine camp.</p>
<p>“I am trying to get as much information as possible and not freak out,” Mr. Sauriol says. “Sure, you can say the numbers are against that happening [to your child], but you can still put yourself in that father's shoes.”</p>
<p>Among Ms. Sauriol's friends – and from what she's read on online discussion forums – “there seems to be a mix of mass panic and total indifference,” she says.</p>
<p>In Comox, B.C., for instance, Karen MacKinnon and her husband have decided they don't want the vaccine for the daughters in their blended family – and both of their ex-spouses agreed. “You make the decision you can best live with,” says Ms. MacKinnon, who noted that even with two children with underlying health problems, they decided to avoid the vaccine because of worries it may not be safe. Instead, the couple keep the girls home when they are tired, get them to bed earlier, and concentrate on healthy eating habits. “We'll watch it,” she says, of the flu's progression. “But I am not going to be suddenly fearful.”</p>
<p>Among parents who have decided against the vaccine – or are leaning that way – this is a common theme: a sense that the flu risk has been exaggerated, and rushing into line for a needle is a panicked response.</p>
<p>“I think it's just mushroomed into a big issue,” says Kami Lahti, a chartered accountant in Regina with two sons, 5 and 7. Her continued uncertainty about the vaccine, she says, determined her choice. “We've all been very undecided: should I, or shouldn't I? If it's that questionable, my answer is no.”</p>
<p>But as Ms. Donders prepared to stand in line for hours yesterday, she suggested that news of children falling dangerously – and even fatally – ill was already shifting opinion in favour of the vaccine among her friends and the moms who follow her blog, Postcards from the Mothership. “I can see the tide slowly turning,” she said.</p>
<p>And Ms. Sauriol has booked an appointment with her family doctor for an expert opinion. For now, she says, “I am practically hosing the kids down with Purell every day.”</p>

<p>Every weekday on FullComment.com, the blog of the National Post comment section, Chris Selley summarizes the offerings of Canada's leading pundits. Printed below are excerpts from Wednesday's Full Pundit compilation. THE GOOD KIND OF 'PARTISAN MUCK'</p>
<p>The Ottawa Citizen's Andrew Potter explains why the Conflict of Interest and Ethics Commissioner shouldn't -- and perhaps can't -- investigate allegations of unethical behaviour with respect to those oversized novelty cheques you've heard so much about. Basically, he argues she, like her predecessors, would simply get bogged down in "partisan muck." Instead he believes government behaviour should be held in check by "the adversarial cut and thrust of parliamentary debate" -- which we generally think of as "partisan muck," but Potter tends to be one of these Parliament-is-working-even-if-it-seems-likeit-isn't people -- and he believes "the Liberals are performing well on that score."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>PREMIER DADDY DAYCARE</p>
<p>In descending order of how likely they think Dalton Mc-Guinty's full-day kindergarten initiative is to become his "legacy" -- whatever that means, exactly -- Adam Radwanski in The Globe and Mail and Jim Coyle in the Toronto Star report on the Ontario Premier's big announcement at an east-end Toronto public school yesterday. Radwanski reports that Mr. McGuinty at one point sounded "vaguely like William Shatner offering a dissertation on education policy." We're sorry we missed that. The Star's editorialists, meanwhile, are broadly supportive of the initiative but skeptical that all the corollary issues -- notably, shifting demands for day care spaces once more four-and five-year-olds are in school all day -- have been adequately thought through.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>THE SUDDENLY ARISTOCRATIC ED STELMACH</p>
<p>The Calgary Herald's Don Braid reports on Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach's ever-mounting woes -- most recently the interminable lines at poorly managed vaccination clinics in Calgary and Edmonton. So discomfited was Mr. Stelmach by questions from NDP leader Brian Mason that he dismissed him as merely a "bus driver" ... and was then forced to apologize to bus drivers everywhere. Awesome.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>J'ACCUSE, JOHN BAIRD!</p>
<p>On his Globe blog, Norman Spector accuses Transport Minister John Baird of providing answers in Question Period that are "devoid of logic," "ethically bankrupt" and "guaranteed to increase the cynicism of Canadians." Well ... yeah. Of course. That's the whole idea. You might as well accuse Denis Coderre of being pugnacious.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>WHY YOU SHOULDN'T WORRY ABOUT H1N1</p>
<p>The Star's Thomas Walkom eloquently appeals for calm on H1N1. This strain is understandably frightening because it afflicts the young and it's new, but "before the H1N1 scare," he notes, "the death from flu of a 13-year-old boy wouldn't have led newscasts across the nation" -- because, unfortunately, people die from the flu all the time.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fuller planes no recovery, Rovinescu says; Air Canada's View</b>
</div><div>Scott Deveau    </div>
<div>Financial Post</div>
<div>519 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>FP4</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>The head of Air Canada said yesterday he expects it will be 12 to 18 months before the airline industry fully recovers from the economic collapse.</p>
<p>Calin Rovinescu, Air Canada chief executive, said during a speech in downtown Toronto yesterday that while there has been some improvements in passenger traffic, he called them "sprouts of improvement" and noted fuller planes do not necessarily mean the industry is on the mend.</p>
<p>Air Canada, like airlines around the globe, has been countering waning demand by lowering prices to get people flying. Until fares reach the level they were at in 2007, especially in business-class cabins, which have been hit the hardest by scaled-back corporate budgets, it will not be a full recovery in his mind, he said.</p>
<p>"I'm not optimistic the recession is over. We are expecting a tough 2010," he said. "The fact that the airplanes are full is not my measure of success."</p>
<p>But as traffic picks up, the airlines should be able to raise prices again and improve profitabilty.</p>
<p>"Historically traffic recovers about six months after the overall economy picks up," Nick Morton, <span class="companylink">RBC Capital Markets</span> analyst, said in a note to clients yesterday "We have been in recession and as GDP comes back we may see a period of up to a year when little capacity is added and already high load factors allow yield/ fare increases. For [Air Canada] the return of the business traveller is the key for yield improvement."</p>
<p>He noted airlines are highly sensitive to small changes in yield, noting that a 1% improvement in 2010 yields would effectively double his $2 price target for Air Canada. "Following a very difficult 2009, if we begin to see yields recover Air Canada stands to reap significant benefits," he said.</p>
<p>Air Canada was able to stave off an impending bankruptcy this year by securing more than $1-billion in financing from a syndicate of lenders, including GE Canada, the federal government, Aeroplan Canada Inc. and <span class="companylink">ACE Aviation Holdings Inc</span>.</p>
<p>The financing was made possible after the airline managed to negotiate a moratorium on part of its pension-funding obligations from its employees and the federal government, and other key concessions from its suppliers and partners, such as <span class="companylink">Jazz Air Income Fund</span>.</p>
<p>The airline has since embarked on an effort to cut costs and drive up revenues to collectively improve its balance sheet by $500-million in the next three years. It also returned to the market recently to raise $250-million through a bought deal.</p>
<p>The equity raise followed similar moves by both <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>., <span class="companylink">Transat A.T</span>., the parent company of <span class="companylink">Air Transat</span>, and several other airlines, including Delta, United and <span class="companylink">American Airlines</span>, who have done so to bolster their balance sheets to brace against the impact of the H1N1 virus and the lingering recession and to scout out acquisitions.</p>

<p>Some able-bodied B.C. residents are lining up and receiving the H1N1 vaccine, even though it's supposed to be for the sick and vulnerable at this stage.</p>
<p>"There are clearly some folk who, I think, are taking advantage," provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall said yesterday.</p>
<p>This week, the H1N1 vaccine was supposed to be given to only people under 65 with chronic conditions, pregnant women, and people in remote communities.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Langford mass-immunization clinic expected to help meet heavy demand; Temperatures rise in Saanich as some are turned away without receiving shot</b>

</p>
<p>Island health officials are hoping some of the frustrations plaguing flu-shot clinics will end today with the first mass-immunization clinic.</p>
<p>At Westshore Town Centre, nurses are aiming to deliver as many as 2,500 shots for H1N1 swine flu and the seasonal variety.</p>
<p>"I think we are ready," said Sandra Herbison, manager of public-health units. "But there is always the unexpected and the unanticipated and we'll learn from that."</p>
<p>Yesterday at Hillside Centre and Gordon Head Recreation Centre, hundreds of people lined up and some were turned away without receiving a shot.</p>
<p>Herbison said part of the problem is that public-health nurses have been asked to take on the task of delivering the H1N1 vaccine at scheduled seasonal flu clinics where seniors and those with compromised immune systems normally get their shots. So venues and numbers of nurses have sometimes proven inadequate.</p>
<p>Heather Follis, who is pregnant, lined up at Hillside Centre with her three-year-old yesterday, only to learn from someone else in line that she wouldn't get her shot because all the numbers had been handed out.</p>
<p>Follis said she wasn't convinced everybody in the line was on the priority list. "It all just seemed a little chaotic to me."</p>
<p>Anne Collins, who has immune deficiencies, said yesterday she lined up outside the Victoria public health unit on Tuesday for hours to get her shots.</p>
<p>Collins said she heard diabetics talk of leaving because their blood sugar was getting low, and saw seniors leaning on canes outside in the cold. "If there are more of these clinics with people standing outside, you are going to get sick people before they even get their shots."</p>
<p>She said people in line were outraged when someone advised they were risking a ticket if they left their vehicles parked in the clinic lot.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Stanwick, chief medical officer of health for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said the scale of the effort, aimed at inoculating 70 per cent of the population, almost guarantees problems. It's been billed as the biggest vaccination campaign in B.C. history.</p>
<p>"I wish we could get it perfect the first day," said Stanwick. "But are we surprised? No."</p>
<p>Stanwick said public complaints are being taken into consideration. "We need to able to learn from each of the clinics we are holding for the next day so we can do better."</p>
<p>The health authority says reports of flu-like illness -- including fever, coughs and sore throat -- are above normal levels for this time of year.</p>
<p>Spikes have appeared in Greater Victoria, Cowichan and Nanaimo, suggesting the pandemic may be at or near its peak in those areas.</p>
<p>But emergency-room visits for flu are not unusually high on the Island, and only eight schools have reported higher-than-average absenteeism.</p>
<p>So far, one person has died on the Island after contracting H1N1 and 27 people have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>This week, inoculations have been aimed at pregnant women, people with underlying health conditions like asthma or diabetes, and those living in remote communities.</p>
<p>Next week, the focus is on children aged six months to five years, health-care workers and people in household contact with infants under six months, and people with compromised immune systems.</p>

<p>Canadians were told yesterday by public-health officials to avoid travel, including public transit, if they show any signs of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The warning came the same day a report described airports across the country as "major gateways for infectious diseases."</p>
<p>The federal government released the new set of guidelines as part of a nationwide effort to curtail the spread of the novel influenza strain during its current second wave. H1N1 flu reached outbreak proportions worldwide last spring.</p>
<p>The document urges passengers and crew who appear ill with H1N1 flu to separate themselves from others as much as possible, and crew to minimize contact with sick passengers.</p>
<p>Those sick should wear a surgical face mask to help protect others.</p>
<p>People who are sick and cannot avoid travel are being asked to go by car, if possible, and travel operators are being asked to make it easy for Canadians to re-book their plans.</p>
<p>Those travelling internationally will be reported, as required by law, if they are suspected of being able to spread a communicable disease, including H1N1. Quarantine officers would assess the situation and advise whether action is required for the sick passenger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal yesterday singled out Toronto's Pearson International Airport as the "most vulnerable point of entry in Canada," followed by the Vancouver and Montreal airports.</p>
<p>The report called for thermal sensors, increased passenger screening and other testing methods to be employed by airports to reduce the spread of infection. It warned that limiting travel was the central focus of efforts to prevent the spread of SARS, when that disease first surfaced in 2002.</p>
<p>"The overwhelming number of SARS cases that moved from country to country were by air travel," said Dr. Kamran Khan of Toronto in the report.</p>

</p>
<p>The Red Wings are taking precautionary measures to guard against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>For the first time that players could remember, each had his own water bottle with his number on it and his own towel during Wednesday's practice at Rexall Place as the Wings face the Edmonton Oilers tonight (9:30 p.m., FSN).</p>
<p>The training staff took extra care to wipe down door knobs, exercise equipment, etc., in the dressing room.</p>
<p>Players are being told to be more diligent in washing their hands.</p>
<p>Detroit centre Kris Draper said he's gone so far as to wash his hands after each time he touches the remote or a light switch in his hotel room.</p>
<p>The Edmonton Oilers have one confirmed case of the swine flu -- Lad-islav Smid.</p>
<p>Smid contracted the H1N1 virus about two weeks ago, but didn't know he had it until Tuesday.</p>
<p>Now he's concer-ned he may have passed it onto his tea-mmates .</p>
<p>"I'm worried," Smid said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"I don't want anybody getting sick because of me."</p>
<p>Smid's locker-room neighbour Lub-omir Visnovsky left the game in the third period Tuesday against Colorado, exhausted after playing only 16 minutes on the night.</p>
<p>Oilers head coach Pat Quinn said Visnovsky has not been tested, but is "being treated as if he has it."</p>
<p>DATSYUK EXPECTS TO PLAY</p>
<p>Red Wings forward Pavel Datsyuk didn't skate Wednesday due to a sore foot from blocking a shot in Tuesday's 5-4 win against the Vancouver Canucks, but coach Mike Babcock said he will play tonight in Edmonton</p>
<p>"I told you that last year in the playoffs, when he got a shot in the foot, too, and it ended up being a hole in his thigh, so you can't trust me one bit," Babcock joked.</p>
<p>"No, he got a shot in the foot and he should go. He just was sore today and it wasn't going to be comfortable getting his skate on.''</p>
<p>HELM, EAVES RETURN</p>
<p>Wings coach Mike Babcock said Darren Helm and Patrick Eaves will return to the lineup, replacing Kirk Maltby and Justin Abdelkader.</p>
<p>Jimmy Howard will start in goal.</p>
<p>Howard was scheduled to start against the Oilers even before Chris Osgood was pulled early in the first period Tuesday after allowing two goals on four shots.</p>
<p>LUONGO SIDELINED</p>
<p>Goaltender Roberto Luongo has a hairline fracture of a rib on his left side -- an injury he suffered absorbing a Niklas Hagman sharp-angle shot against the Toronto Maple Leafs Saturday -- and won't be in the lineup when the Vancouver Canucks play tonight in Los Angeles and Friday in Anaheim.</p>
<p>While it was widely speculated that Luongo was injured against the Wings -- especially in crease collisions with Todd Bertuzzi and Tomas Holmstrom -- the starter said that wasn't the case.</p>

</p>
<p>Let me get this straight. The WHO conveniently rewrote the definition of a "pandemic" to exclude a high mortality count.</p>
<p>Then, in June of this year, it recommended that nations no longer test for the virus but just assume that H1N1 is the culprit based on broad symptoms that could mimic any number of flu-like illnesses.</p>
<p>Now, CBS reports that state labs that were running tests on suspected H1N1 cases, prior to no-test directives, found that as few as one per cent of the cases tested positive for the H1N1 virus and, what's more, that many of the cases did not even test positive for the seasonal flu. This is a scandal of shameful proportions. Just who is pushing pandemic fever and to whose benefit? I need this vaccine like I need a hole in the head.</p>

</p>
<p>Until the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit receives its next shipment of the H1N1 vaccine this week, it is difficult to say whether flu shot clinic hours can be extended, the region's medical officer of health said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Allen Heimann said about 1,800 people got the vaccine at the first public H1N1 clinic in Tecumseh Tuesday. But as the lineup outside the Knights of Columbus hall grew, OPP officers began turning people away at the back of the line because clinic staff expected it would take them until 9 p.m. -- an hour after the scheduled closing time -- to serve those already in the queue.</p>
<p>"Our initial shipment (of the vaccine) was 18,000 doses. That covers only four per cent of our population," Heimann said. "We are getting more, but we don't know exactly how much yet. The difficulty is also in anticipating public demand."</p>
<p>Heimann said the much-publicized death of a 13-year-old boy in Toronto who officials confirmed had swine flu likely contributed to the huge turnout at Tuesday's clinic. Many parents said the news motivated them to bring in their kids for vaccination right away.</p>
<p>Heimann said the health unit is still trying to focus on immunizing high-risk groups first -- pregnant women, people under 30 and those with pre-existing conditions -- and is encouraging anyone belonging to those categories to get the shot as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"Those groups are more likely to develop complications from the flu and right now, it's the complications that we're trying to prevent," he said.</p>
<p>The health unit is also moving forward with plans to immunize health care workers by joining forces with Windsor's two hospitals to make the vaccine more widely available to them.</p>
<p>More details will be announced at a news conference this morning.</p>
<p>Windsor Regional Hospital and Hotel-Dieu Grace Hospital are starting to see an increase in patients coming in with flu-like symptoms and upper respiratory problems.</p>
<p>Heimann said that's to be expected.</p>
<p>Hotel-Dieu is reporting an increase of about 30 patients per day in its emergency department this week, but so far, none with flu symptoms have had to be admitted.</p>
<p>Heimann said there have been nine new lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 in the region this week and another eight last week.</p>
<p>But those numbers don't paint an accurate picture of the virus' spread because there are many more people who could have had the virus but have not been tested for it.</p>
<p>Since April, Hotel-Dieu has seen nine confirmed cases of the H1N1 flu, of which only two required brief admissions, vice-president of operations and chief nursing executive Pat Somers said at the hospital board meeting Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We've always had a regular influenza pandemic plan in place and that plan is in effect right now," she said.</p>
<p>The plan includes screening all patients for signs and symptoms of the flu, rigorous handwashing and use of alcohol-based hand rubs, as well as a pandemic management team on standby if H1N1 patients start filling up hospital beds, health officials said.</p>
<p>The second public H1N1 clinic will be held today from 2 to 8 p.m. at the Windsor Knights of Columbus hall on 2401 Columbus St.</p>
<p>Visit the health unit's website, ww.wechealthunit.org, for next week's clinic dates and times.</p>
<p>AVOID TRAVEL, FEDS ADVISE</p>
<p>Canadians were told Wednesday by public-health officials to avoid travel, including public transit, if they show any signs of H1N1 swine flu, a warning that came the same day a report described airports across the country as "major gateways for infections diseases."</p>

<p>Furniture retailer IKEA is keeping its play areas very clean.</p>
<p>The stores' supervised ballrooms, in which kids romp and cavort among multicoloured balls, are being sterilized and cleaned daily as part of H1N1 precautionary measures.</p>
<p>"We're not allowing kids who are sick in the play area," said company spokeswoman Madeline Frick.</p>
<p>Frick said IKEA has no plans to close the play areas in its stores.</p>

<p>My niece is under two and has a very serious medical condition.</p>
<p>She was supposed to be vaccinated in her home by a public health nurse on the first day but a nurse phoned to say that since the public clinics are now the first to get the vaccine my niece and her parent should go to one and line up.</p>
<p>That makes no sense. Why would you redirect vaccines for the most vulnerable away from the community public health nurses who administer them at home and in hospitals?</p>
<p>Public clinic staff are overwhelmed with the lineups of those claiming to have chronic illnesses while those who truly do have them can't line up in public places during flu season and are told to wait at least another week.</p>
<p>There is something very wrong with this system. I know that with patience, we will all get our H1N1 shot, but once again the truly vulnerable suffer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Threat to hospital is threat to public health; Authority's plan to cut ER hours goes against all logic</b>

</p>
<p>For a graphic example of how B.C.'s government is dropping the ball on health care, look no further than the Fraser Valley.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Victoria is literally bulldozing its way past widespread public opposition to build the $1-billion South Fraser Perimeter Road through farmland in Delta, using your tax dollars.</p>
<p>On the other hand, these penny-wise, pound-foolish politicians have placed Fraser Health Authority into a budget-cutting corner that threatens basic life-saving emergency services in Mission, a 37,000-strong community that is growing faster than the FHA's region and the province itself.</p>
<p>In a bid to save $390,000 annually, Fraser Health is considering closing Mission Memorial Hospital's emergency room service during the nine-hour overnight period on a daily basis. It's the first of three options FHA presented in a recently released discussion paper it prepared for Mission and the B.C. Ministry of Health on the ER's future.</p>
<p>The second option maintains the status quo -- an ER operating on a 24/7 basis and handling more than 19,000 visits annually. Obviously, this option has no impact on Fraser Health's overall goal of eliminating its $130-million annual budget shortfall.</p>
<p>Under option three, Mission's ER would be downgraded to a daytime urgent-care centre offering neither patient admissions nor ambulance service. That option has already been discarded by Fraser Health.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, after reading the FHA report, Mission Mayor James Atebe and his council quickly passed a resolution last Monday to support only the status quo. "The savings of $390,000 per year is less that the cost of an average home in Mission," Atebe told me yesterday. "Is that worth risking even one life by closing our ER overnight? I don't think so.</p>
<p>"That closure will probably mean losing a few doctors as well and it will likely add costs to the ERs at Maple Ridge and Abbotsford hospitals that will have to handle those overnight Mission patients," he added.</p>
<p>According to the FHA report, 83 per cent of emergency visits made by Mission residents to their own ER were able to be handled there. Only the most serious emergencies required moving patients elsewhere.</p>
<p>And because Mission's ER is a 24/7 service department, its staff and physicians also respond to calls throughout the hospital during day and night shifts.</p>
<p>Nor is this community stagnant. Mission's population grew 10.3 per cent between 2001 and 2006, compared with 8.2 per cent for the Fraser Health region and 5.3 per cent for B.C.</p>
<p>Like elsewhere, the average age of this growing population will rise and require more health care, not less.</p>
<p>"We will have reached a resolution on Mission's ER within two or three weeks once our consultations with the community are completed," says Dr. Nigel Murray of the FHA.</p>
<p>To cut emergency services in Mission, along with earlier cuts to key medical services elsewhere in the Fraser Valley, threatens public health.</p>
<p>H1N1 be damned -- is there a vaccine against the Campbell government?</p>

</p>
<p>Week 6 in the National Hockey League has four of last season's bottom six teams playing four games, highlighted with a long trip by the Tampa Bay Lightning, who head to Eastern Canada.</p>
<p>By Week 6, most teams will have played their 15th game, which is a good benchmark as to how the team is performing. The Phoenix Coyotes have come back to life, so look for other options to dress unless you have Shane Doan or Ed Jovanovski. Meanwhile, the Colorado Avalanche continue their hot play, so get goalie Craig Anderson if you can, as Peter Budaj has the H1N1 virus, meaning Anderson will get a lot of starts.</p>
<p>Being the team captain doesn't necessarily mean that player is the team's best offensive player. Leadership skills don't always translate into fantasy points. Let's take a look at a few captains and how their seasons are going.</p>
<p>Roberto Luongo: If you listened to me last week and kept the Vancouver Canucks goaltender, then he rewarded you with a couple of wins and a shutout. Luongo is starting to regain his confidence and his play is steadily improving. However, it was announced Wednesday Luongo has a hairline fracture of a rib on his left side -- an injury he suffered absorbing a Niklas Hagman sharp-angle shot against the Toronto Maple Leafs on Saturday -- and won't be in the lineup when the Canucks play today in Los Angeles and Friday in Anaheim. Backup Andrew Raycroft will get the call both nights. It's not known how long Luongo will be out.</p>
<p>Scott Niedermayer: The Anaheim Ducks defenceman is at a team-low minus-seven, despite scoring seven points in 10 games. Three of Niedermayer's seven points have come from the power play, so that is not the issue. In seven of the first 10 games, Niedermayer has had a rating of zero or lower. As Niedermayer gets older his plus/minus rating gets lower.</p>
<p>Dustin Brown: Brown continues to lead the young Los Angeles Kings to a stellar start this season. The Kings are 8-4 and don't look to slow down anytime soon. Brown gives the Kings a strong second line and can jump up to the first line when Justin Williams is injured. Try to get the young King players now before their value skyrockets as many of them could see career numbers this season.</p>
<p>Shane Doan: The Coyotes saga may finally be over and Doan is on a hot streak. Doan finished off the first 10 games of this season with a five-game point streak, scoring three goals and five assists. Doan has been a consistent scorer for the Coyotes and is on pace for a career year with 80 points.</p>
<p>Nicklas Lidstrom: The Detroit Red Wings captain is 39 and finally showing he is human. If you look at the defencemen point scoring race, you won't find Lidstrom in his usual top-five position. In fact you won't find him anywhere in the top 75 as of Oct. 27. Don't worry that Lidstrom only has three points after 10 games. Once he and the Wings get rolling, Lidstrom will get his 50 points.</p>
<p>Now we highlight the prospect of the week:</p>
<p>Brayden Schenn: Schenn was selected fifth overall by the Kings in the NHL Entry Draft this year and is the co-captain of the WHL's Brandon Wheat Kings. The native of Saskatoon has 18 points in the first 12 games of the WHL season. Schenn is a complete player with a strong work ethic who loves to take the puck hard to the net. Schenn has been compared to Bryan Trottier and should see his value go up with a strong showing at the world junior hockey championship and the Memorial Cup.</p>

<p>A Canada West women's hockey series scheduled for Friday and Saturday in Lethbridge between the University of Lethbridge and University of Saskatchewan has been postponed due to a flu outbreak on the Lethbridge campus.</p>
<p>More than one-quarter of the Pronghorns team is experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"It was very important to postpone this series to ensure that our team members and our visitors were not further exposed to the flu-like symptoms that have been spreading through the community," said Lethbridge assistant coach Deb Marek. "We currently have six players and coach Chandy Kaip away ill, and their health and well-being is critical."</p>
<p>Instead, the Pronghorns will face the Huskies on Jan. 2 and 3, 2010.</p>
<p>There are more than 300 students, staff and faculty listed as ill on the U of Lethbridge's flu registry -- about three per cent of the school's student and employee population.</p>
<p>"The teams are doing the right thing in postponing their games and asking their players to self-isolate if they exhibit flu-like symptoms," U of Lethbridge health centre manager Lori Weber said. "This reinforces the fact that this illness, whether it is the seasonal flu or H1N1, is to be taken seriously."</p>

<p>The H1N1 flu virus took centre stage Wednesday as Saskatchewan's First Nations chiefs gathered for their annual fall assembly at Saskatoon's TCU Place.</p>
<p>Dr. Moira McKinnon, Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, spoke to Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN) delegates about the importance of hand washing, getting vaccinated and other measures to contain the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>She applauded the various measures taken by conference organizers.</p>
<p>"You've done a fantastic job here. Life can be normal. We just have to be careful," McKinnon said.</p>
<p>She said the amount of vaccine available to Saskatchewan residents has recently been reduced and officials must target high-risk groups first.</p>
<p>Notices about the H1N1 virus were placed beside posters for candidates in today's FSIN election. They reminded the assembled delegates to wash or sanitize hands frequently and to not be offended if someone declines to shake hands.</p>
<p>Before delegates could register, they were required to fill out a brief questionnaire asking whether they have had flu-like symptoms recently or have been in contact with anyone who has been sick. If so, they were required to see a health official on hand to get clearance to attend.</p>
<p>Acting FSIN chief Delbert Wapass said there are "legitimate concerns" about the virus, which is spreading across Saskatchewan and may hit aboriginal communities particularly hard.</p>
<p>"What precautions are we going to take?" Wapass said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Anxiety a symptom of H1NI pandemic fears</b>
</div><div>Pamela Cowan   </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>585 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>Anxiety is rising as the number of cases of H1N1 influenza increases.</p>
<p>These days, Gord Asmundson, whose work at the University of Regina's psychology department includes a focus on health anxiety, is hearing that a lot of people are feeling anxious about the potential impact of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"It's a case of not knowing that leads to a lot of concern," he said. "It's important to receive information about what is going on, about the potential effects that H1N1 is having, about the availability of the vaccine and about how to conduct oneself with respect to the virus and potentially getting vaccinated. On the other hand, I've also heard people express concern about the imbalance of information."</p>
<p>As an example, he pointed to the media's focus on H1N1 deaths, but the lack of similar reportage about seasonal flu deaths during the same time. That can create fear, which occurs when a person feels in immediate danger.</p>
<p>"In the case of the H1N1 virus, this is something that has less certainty with respect to its severity and whether it affects everyone equally because we don't know enough, so there's a degree of uncertainty," Asmundson said. "When something feels like fear in response to something that is a less imminent threat, that's not fear, that's anxiety."</p>
<p>Increased news coverage can affect people psychologically, he added.</p>
<p>"We start focusing on symptoms in our bodies and then we make a decision about what those symptoms might mean," Asmundson said. "At present, most people are probably thinking that if they get a fever or a sore throat or start coughing, it's H1N1, and it may or may not be."</p>
<p>When Michael J. Fox's battle with Parkinson's disease became public, Asmundson recalled many people misinterpreted their twitching eyelids and shakiness as signs they, too, had the disease.</p>
<p>Similarly, during the SARS epidemic, people misinterpreted mild coughs as an indication of the dreaded respiratory disease, he said.</p>
<p>Valid, reliable information will help people put things into perspective and make sound judgments, Asmundson said.</p>
<p>"There needs to be some caution about where you direct people to get their information," he said. "Telling people to go to good websites might not mean anything if somebody doesn't understand how to evaluate a good or reputable website."</p>
<p>Registered psychologist Marilyn Gosselin said pandemic anxiety can be kept in check if health professionals provide accurate H1N1 information.</p>
<p>She said staff at the Standing Buffalo School on the Standing Buffalo Dakota First Nation have done an excellent job of informing students about H1N1 without instilling fear in them.</p>
<p>"When you go into that school, the children don't seem worried, but they are coughing into their sleeve if they cough and there is a noticeable presence of proper handwashing amongst all of the children," Gosselin said. "They've given the children the education. They're not just hapless victims then. They have some control over their situation and they're rising to the occasion and practising good preventative medicine."</p>
<p>Last week, Gosselin was exposed to sneezing and coughing people at a public forum. A couple of days later, she developed a cough and a headache -- symptoms that wouldn't ordinarily keep her from her job with the File Hills Qu'Appelle Tribal Council.</p>
<p>But the spreading H1N1 virus is top of mind for her, like many others.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sbisa back with 'Canes for now</b>
</div><div>Greg Harder   </div>
<div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>681 words</div><div>29 October 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Luca Sbisa is back with the Lethbridge Hurricanes, but for how long? The 19-year-old defenceman was assigned to Lethbridge by the NHL's Anaheim Ducks on Monday but he didn't immediately report to the WHL club.</p>
<p>According to various media reports, Sbisa's agent, Andre Rufner, made it known that he would like to see Lethbridge trade his client to another WHL team. However, Hurricanes head coach/GM Rich Preston -- whose club is not a championship contender this season -- has said he wants Sbisa in the lineup and he isn't particularly interested in dealing the Swiss blueliner.</p>
<p>Apparently Rufner has been trying to facilitate a swap with a Western Conference team.</p>
<p>The Vancouver Giants would be a natural destination, given the fact that they have an opening for an import player and could use a little more experience on the back end. Not to mention the fact that top-end players with options tend to gravitate towards the large-market Giants.</p>
<p>"If he was available, I'm sure every team in the league would inquire," Giants GM Scott Bonner told the Vancouver Province.</p>
<p>"But I know I haven't got a call about him and I know that Rich Preston is pretty excited about getting him back. If it was us, we would keep the player. We would tell the player to come back and play for us and I think Rich will take the same stance."</p>
<p>Lo and behold, the Hurricanes sent out a media release on Wednesday announcing that Sbisa is indeed reporting to the club and will be in the lineup Friday night against the Seattle Thunderbirds. You'd have to think the quick resolution might have something to do with the influence of Ducks GM Bob Murray. He and Preston are former teammates and long-time friends.</p>
<p>Regardless, you get the feeling this situation is far from settled, especially with elite teams like Vancouver and the Calgary Hitmen in the market for an impact blueliner. The price might be a little steep for the Regina Pats, who look to be just about set on the back end and are more likely to pursue another impact forward. That said, GM Brent Parker has made it clear that if the Pats get on a roll and prove they're close to becoming a contender by mid-season, he'll explore every opportunity to improve the roster at the trade deadline.</p>
<p>If the Hurricanes are indeed willing to field offers -- and they'd be foolish to not listen -- Sbisa would immediately be the hottest commodity on the trade market. A first-round pick (19th overall) in the 2008 NHL entry draft, Sbisa played 39 games with the Philadelphia Flyers last season before he was sent back to Lethbridge, where he had 15 points in 18 games.</p>
<p>The Flyers then sent Sbisa to Anaheim in an off-season trade for Chris Pronger. The Ducks kept him around for eight games before deciding it would be in Sbisa's long-term interests to spend one more year in the junior ranks. Where he ends up remains to be seen.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The WHL could have its first case of H1N1.</p>
<p>There are unconfirmed reports that Giants winger Cass Mappin, who missed two games on the weekend and spent some time in hospital, may have contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Upon returning to practice on Wednesday, Mappin told Steve Ewen of the Province that he didn't know if he had the swine flu, since he hadn't undergone any blood tests.</p>
<p>Mappin also told Ewen that he didn't step on a scale because he didn't want to find out how much weight he lost from the illness.</p>
<p>"By Saturday, I was out of commission," said Mappin, 18, who was acquired from the Red Deer Rebels on Sept. 29 for winger Andrej Kudrna. "I was fatigued. I couldn't eat anything. The only thing I could do was lie there and drink water."</p>
<p>(Centre Ice appears Thursdays.)</p>

<p>The Saskatchewan Roughriders are trying to kick the flu bug.</p>
<p>Several members of the CFL club have been absent at various times this fall due to illness, the latest being kicker Luca Congi, who was sent home prior to Wednesday's practice. Meanwhile, linebackers Mike McCullough and Jerrell Freeman returned to the field after missing Tuesday's workout because they were "under the weather."</p>
<p>Other players who've been reported ill in recent weeks include Jocelyn Frenette, Steven Jyles, Chris Best and Antonio Hall. Lance Frazier returned to practice Wednesday after missing Saturday's game against the B.C. Lions due to the flu.</p>
<p>"It has been going around," admitted head coach Ken Miller. "It has been going around for some time."</p>
<p>The Riders have been taking precautions to minimize the danger of spreading an illness around the locker room. In fact, the team's vigilance has increased due to the H1N1 threat, but Miller isn't pushing the panic button.</p>
<p>"We're all at risk and we all have some concerns," he noted. "We know it's around, we know it's in the province, we know there are possibilities for that. Right now we're pretty sure that we don't have it. This is cold and flu season, so until we get a confirmed case, we're not going to go to extra lengths to be concerned -- beyond reason anyway."</p>
<p>That said, Miller has specifically addressed the H1N1 issue with his players on more than one occasion. He spoke to them as recently as Tuesday about ways of reducing the risks of contracting and spreading the virus.</p>
<p>"It has been a reminder constantly in these last several weeks," said Miller. "We do what I think -- and hope -- most people do in a regular workplace, just encourage people to be really good with their hygiene, wash their hands with soap and water and cough into their sleeve and do things that you do to avoid getting a cold or flu. I also talked to them about hydration, because sometimes when you get a touch of flu, particularly at this time of year, none of us are inclined to take in as much fluids as we need. If we don't take in fluids, we set ourselves up not only for a more serious illness but muscle pulls and cramps and those kind of things."</p>
<p>In the end, however, Miller can only do so much to protect his team. The onus is ultimately on the players to be responsible and follow instructions.</p>
<p>"This is the time of year we're all pretty cautious ... with the weather changing and more and more people getting sick," noted veteran centre Jeremy O'Day. "Being in the locker room with all the guys, you definitely have to take care of yourself. It has been mentioned by the coaches, making sure you're taking care of your body and making sure you're washing your hands and staying as clean as you can so you can avoid passing any germs. This is a tough time of year and with the (flu outbreak) being the way it is makes it a little bit tougher."</p>
<p>The Riders typically offer standard flu shots to their players and will do the same when the H1N1 vaccine is released to the public. Yet, no matter how many precautions they take, there are no guarantees against contracting the virus.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadians were told Wednesday by public health officials to avoid travel, including public transit, if they show any signs of H1N1 swine flu, a warning that came the same day a report described airports across the country as "major gateways for infections diseases."</p>
<p>The federal government released the new set of guidelines as part of a nationwide effort to curtail the spread of the novel influenza strain during its current second wave. The swine flu reached outbreak proportions worldwide last spring.</p>
<p>The document urges passengers and crew who appear ill with H1N1 flu to separate themselves from others as much as possible and that crews minimize their contact with any sick passengers.</p>
<p>Those sick should wear a surgical face mask to help protect others.</p>
<p>People who are sick and cannot avoid travel are being asked to go by car if possible and travel operators are being asked to make it easy for Canadians to re-book their plans.</p>
<p>Those travelling internationally will be reported, as required by law, if they are suspected of being able to spread a communicable disease, including H1N1. Quarantine officers would assess the situation and advise whether action is required for the sick passenger.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a report in the Canadian Medical Association Journal Wednesday singled out Toronto's Pearson International Airport as the "most vulnerable point of entry in Canada," followed by the Vancouver and Montreal airports.</p>
<p>The report called for thermal sensors, increased passenger screening and other testing methods to be employed by airports to reduce the spread of infection. It warned that limiting travel was the central focus of efforts to prevent the spread of SARS, when that disease first surfaced in 2002.</p>
<p>"The overwhelming number of SARS cases that moved from country to country were by air travel," said Dr. Kamran Khan of St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto in the report. "Now we're seeing the same with novel H1N1."</p>
<p>Across the country, emergency rooms and telephone health lines continued to jam Wednesday as concerned parents anxious about their children sought medical assistance.</p>
<p>In Toronto, officials confirmed late Wednesday an outbreak of H1N1 flu at Mount Sinai Hospital that was limited to one ward and involved two staff members and a patient. It is the first outbreak reported at a Canadian hospital.</p>
<p>A potential outbreak at a long-term care facility in Toronto was also being investigated by public health officials.</p>
<p>At the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Dr. Anne Matlow said Wednesday their emergency room has seen "double" the number of patients in the last few days compared to what was considered normal for the start of the influenza season.</p>
<p>At Ottawa's Children's Hospital of eastern Ontario, staff were reporting that their emergency clinic, which usually sees 150 children on any given day in October, has risen to more than double that number. Two-thirds of the children who have come in have been identified as having flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Toronto's medical officer of health, Dr. David McKeown, said Wednesday that high absenteeism in schools was an obvious "indicator of the level of activity of the virus in the community."</p>
<p>In Montreal, eight schools reported having an outbreak of swine flu illness in the last 24 hours -- double the number of schools that had been hit in the past two weeks. An outbreak is defined as a situation where more than 10 per cent of students have been kept home with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>McKeown cautioned again that the demand for the vaccination will continue to grow and asked for Canadians to remain patient as those identified in the priority groups get the shot first. Those considered most at-risk for H1N1 are health-care professionals, pregnant women, the elderly, the chronically ill and young children between six months to five years old.</p>
<p>Everyone else should wait until Monday when the public clinics open in Toronto, said McKeown.</p>
<p>Canada's Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said Wednesday that he understands why parents might have an increased level of worry following the recent deaths of two youth in Ontario from H1N1.</p>
<p>They should not, however, take their worry to the extreme and keep their children from participating in Halloween activities, for example.</p>
<p>Keep their hands clean, make sure they don't share glasses at a party -- but if they are ill, they should be kept home, he said. Ask other children to trick-or-treat for them, Butler-Jones suggested.</p>
<p>"Finding other ways so that kids can enjoy Halloween even if they're ill without actually having to go out there, I think is one way to address it," he said.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq also warned Wednesday that the hours-long lineups will continue as crowds gather to get their vaccinations.</p>

<p>Health-care workers in Saskatchewan who choose not to get vaccinated against H1N1 could be sent home without pay, the province's health ministry said Thursday.</p>
<p>"If there is a defined outbreak in a health-care facility, the regional medical health officer has the authority, under the Public Health Act, to require that employees either be vaccinated or excluded from work, until measures are taken," said Karen Hill, spokeswoman for Saskatchewan's health ministry.</p>
<p>"The employee can go home and take vacation pay, or time that's banked, or there's the option to take anti-viral medication and potentially go and work in another health-care facility where an outbreak hasn't occurred."</p>
<p>But the head of Canada's nurses' union said no one has the right to deny a health-care worker her pay if she doesn't want to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"Nurses are unionized, they work under collective agreements, and there's no way an employer can mandate a nurse or other health-care worker to take a vaccination," said Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses Unions. "We encourage it, but at the same time, it's a personal decision."</p>
<p>Silas said an alternative to sending un-vaccinated health-care workers home without pay is moving them to facilities where there are no outbreaks.</p>
<p>Furthermore, vaccinations aren't the only way to prevent disease, she stressed: Health-care workers can protect themselves by wearing gloves, gowns, and masks, and by using respirators.</p>
<p>"We'll certainly be expressing grave concerns if they decide to implement this," added Chris Diol, president of the Health Sciences Association of Saskatchewan, the union for the province's health-care workers.</p>

<p>Question: Now that pandemic flu cases are becoming more prevalent, should people with high-risk medical conditions take special precautions -- such as avoiding crowds?</p>
<p>Answer: The Public Health Agency of Canada advises people to continue their daily lives during the pandemic. The agency recommends people go to work or community events if they are healthy, however strongly advise anyone who feels unwell to stay at home. In crowded situations that cannot be avoided, handwashing should be more frequent to avoid picking up the virus. Pregnant women or others who are risk for complications might consider carrying hand sanitizer for the same purpose.</p>

<p>Will Don Martin guarantee me an absolute 100% guaranteeee that the N1H1 vcaccine will have absolutely no side affects, short term or long term?</p>
<p>From Health Canada's web site: "Product Information Leaflet Arepanrix H1N1 AS03 -Adjuvanted H1N1 Pandemic Influenza Vaccine." I learn that this vaccine contains the following nonmedical ingredients: "Thimerosal, a mercury derivative is added as a preservative that contains 2.5 micrograms of mercury.</p>
<p>Other ingredients include trace amounts of: squalene ... formadehyde ... polysorbate 80 ..."</p>
<p>Thimerosal may be 50 times more toxic than regular mercury and has been linked to many disorders including autism. Mercury is a known neurotoxin. Squalene, an oil-based adjuvant, has been linked to severe arthritic symptoms. Formaldehyde is a known cancer-causing agent. Polysorbate 80 has been linked to allergic reations.</p>

<p>Re: Officials Urge Calm As H1N1 Claims Teen, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>The constant flow of information about the H1N1 "pandemic" and the constant misuse of this term along -- with the confusing misuse of the terms endemic and epidemic -- caused me to recall a brilliant lecture. It was given 40 years ago at the Montreal Children's Hospital by Dr. Warren Wheeler, a distinguished U.S. scientist, epidemiologist and physician. Dr. Wheeler and his associates had done research into all known attributable causes of infection with the influenza virus -- kissing, chills after getting damp, etc. Their absolute conclusion was that the influenza virus enters the human respiratory tract after shaking hands with a carrier and inoculating the virus into the respiratory tract by placing the index finger into one's nostril.</p>
<p>That research was reasonable, responsible and factual. Dr. Wheeler went on to state that many methods of attempting to prevent infection by the influenza virus were no more efficacious than the man who constantly snapped his fingers 12 hours a day.</p>
<p>When asked by a curious bystander why he constantly snapped his fingers the man replied, "To keep the lions away!" When his enquirer remarked, "There are no lions here", the man replied, "That's right; snapping my fingers keeps them away!"</p>
<p>The presentation to the public of the present "pandemic" may possibly be related more to the thinking of the man who was keeping the lions away.</p>

<p>Re: Canadians Lining Up At Vaccine Clinic, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>In all the discussion about the H1N1 virus and priorities for the vaccine there has been no mention of Fetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorder (FASD).</p>
<p>Those with FASD have deficient immune systems that make them more susceptible to viral and bacterial infections.</p>
<p>They also have cognitive and information processing disabilities that, with their adaptive and executive functioning limitations, will make it difficult for them to apply the necessary precautions to avoid infection. Hence they will be at greater risk for contracting H1N1 in an epidemic situation.</p>
<p>Ninety-four percent of those diagnosed with FASD will have comorbid mental health diagnoses. Many of them end up as homeless or in prison.</p>
<p>If those with FASD are not treated as a priority they may well act as a source of infection to the rest of the population.</p>
<p>Clearly, people diagnosed with FASD should be considered a priority for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

</div><div>Jenn Sharp and Janet French </div>

</p>
<p>There are not enough respiratory therapists in Saskatoon to meet the expected demand during an H1N1 flu outbreak, says the union that represents those health professionals.</p>
<p>Chris Driol, president of the Health Sciences Association of Saskatchewan (HSAS), said the Saskatchewan Party government has not done enough to ensure Saskatoon has adequate numbers of health-care workers for an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>"This is unacceptable," Driol said Tuesday. "Saskatchewan residents who become acutely ill need the best possible care. That's what putting patients first is all about."</p>
<p>Saskatoon Health Region officials disagree. At a news conference Tuesday, they said Saskatoon hospitals have enough respiratory therapists and other health professionals to handle an influx of patients on ventilators during a mild to moderate pandemic flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Deb Gudmundson, executive director of acute care for the region, says a mass immunization campaign for health-care workers and the public, currently underway, should prevent an outbreak of the virus from reaching a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>Driol says he believes an appropriate staffing level in Saskatoon should be one respiratory therapist for every four to six ventilated patients. Currently, he says, the region has one therapist working for every six to eight ventilated patients.</p>
<p>But Karen Levesque, director of general medicine for the health region, says neither the region nor the Canadian Society of Respiratory Therapists has any guidelines about such ratios. Staffing levels are determined by the number of patients and how sick they are. During the past six months, the region has had a ratio of one therapist per five to six patients, Levesque said.</p>
<p>"We're actually quite comfortable with the number of respiratory therapists we have right now," Levesque said. "We actually are staffed much better than we have been for several years."</p>
<p>There are no jobs posted in the region for respiratory therapists. The equivalent of 52 full-time respiratory therapists work in Saskatoon's hospitals.</p>
<p>Driol, however, says Saskatoon requires another 10 to 15 therapists to provide essential acute care to H1N1 patients during an outbreak.</p>
<p>Although Driol acknowledges the health region has added 37 beds and has increased the number of ventilators to 90, he says human resources required to manage ventilated patients are "woefully inadequate."</p>
<p>"Research clearly shows that H1N1 is particularly more virulent than seasonal flu in affecting younger people, resulting in hospitalization," he said. Driol estimates an additional 40 patients per week will require ventilators and the expertise of respiratory therapists.</p>
<p>Gudmundson disagrees with that number, too, saying the number of ventilated patients will likely double from about 25 to 50 in a worst-case scenario.</p>
<p>The region's pandemic plan also accounts for the possibility that 25 to 30 per cent of health-care workers could be off sick, she said.</p>
<p>Twenty additional nurses have been trained to assist during the H1N1 flu season, but Driol says that's not enough. He says nurses are able to assist respiratory therapists but are not trained to provide the necessary care to patients on ventilators.</p>
<p>Although other health professionals will play a role, Levesque said the region is ready to pull respiratory therapists out of other areas of hospitals into critical-care units if they're needed.</p>
<p>In Regina, provincial Health Minister Don McMorris said Saskatchewan needs to recruit more respiratory therapists. The province has made strides in recruitment in recent years, he added, jumping from 128 respiratory therapists in 2007 to 158 this year.</p>
<p>"In the event that there is a huge increase in H1N1, there are going to be certainly some pressures," McMorris said in response to HSAS's concerns. "There isn't a system across Canada that if you have a huge influx there isn't going to be pressure on their system and some contingency plans will be put in place."</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 is hitting Canadian workplaces as more people call in sick and employers beef up contingency plans.</p>
<p>Most larger employers, such as the big banks, are well prepared, particularly those that weathered the SARS outbreak in 2003.</p>
<p>It's a different story for smaller businesses with more limited resources, though.</p>
<p>Almost half of small business owners are unfamiliar with business continuity planning, and 80 per cent say preparing for potential disruptions is low on their to-do lists, a American Express survey showed last week.</p>
<p>Employees, too, are grappling with whether to call in sick – and potentially miss a week's pay – or show up for work, to the ire of their co-workers.</p>
<p>In Quebec, almost a quarter of employees say they would still show up for work even if they had the H1N1 flu virus, a poll commissioned by the Ordre des conseillers en resources humaines found this month.</p>
<p>Here's a temperature reading on what some employers in some sectors are doing, and what advisers are saying:.</p>
<p>Transport</p>
<p>Like many other large companies, Via Rail, which employs 3,000 people across the country, has shifted into high gear. Via's pandemic working group, which used to gather infrequently, now meets every 15 days to discuss the status of the swine flu outbreak, said spokeswoman Catherine Kaloutsky.</p>
<p>The company has run tests to simulate how it would run if 10 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent of its work force is missing. If absenteeism grows beyond 30 per cent, train service would be interrupted, it estimates.</p>
<p>Should the outbreak affect Toronto train lines, it plans to bring in workers from Vancouver to pitch in.</p>
<p>Banks</p>
<p>Bank of Nova Scotia has several tools to educate employees about swine flu. Like many large employers, its central intranet site gives employees contact information and links to public health agency websites. It sends out regular all-staff e-mails on the issue. And it's distributing a “flu flyer” – a brochure for staff with information on the flu.</p>
<p>Most big banks have a chief medical officer on staff to advise on pandemics and other health issues.</p>
<p>The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada, which oversees the banks, is asking institutions to review and update their business continuity plans.</p>

</p>
<p>Consultancies</p>
<p>Swine flu is causing many companies to bolster their telecommunication capabilities.</p>
<p>Workers at Toronto communications consulting firm Cohn & Wolfe are now equipped with laptops and BlackBerrys, so they can work from home. “It's accelerated plans for portable communication,” said Dave Gordon, executive vice president.</p>
<p>It has tested its technology to ensure that all of its 35 employees can now work offsite if need be.</p>
<p>The other change around the office? “A lot of people are saying ‘you know, the storeroom is out of Kleenex and Purell.' They notice that now and they wouldn't have before. And the employer wouldn't have been expected to stock it.”</p>
<p>Insurers</p>
<p>The insurance industry is monitoring developments “very closely” and is in contact with governments and public health agencies, says Wendy Hope, spokeswoman for Canadian Life and Health Insurance Association.</p>
<p>This week, the association added an H1N1 section to its website, which has links and will provide industry-specific information as it becomes available.</p>
<p>What lawyers say</p>
<p>Employment lawyers are being swamped with calls.</p>
<p>The main questions are whether an employer should pay a worker off sick for a week; how employers can encourage staff to stay home if sick; how to tell whether someone's legitimately ill, and how to set up a business so people can work remotely, says Janice Rubin, an employment lawyer at Toronto-based Rubin Thomlinson LLP.</p>
<p>Another potential worry is if an employee spreads rumours about the health status of a co-worker. “If there are rumours swirling around about you being sick and you infecting people, and it becomes impossible for you to come to work, that is theoretically a case of discrimination under the human rights code,” she cautions.</p>
<p>What doctors say</p>
<p>Employers: skip the doctor's note. That's the recent message from the Ontario Medical Association.</p>
<p>Doctors are asking employers to stop asking for a sick note from a physician as medical caseloads rise.</p>
<p>Rather, they should trust their employees. And employees shouldn't take advantage of this year's flu season to skip off work, it says.</p>
<p>“In order to help reduce the transmission of H1N1 and other illnesses, Ontario's doctors believe it is wise for patients to stay home when they have flu-like symptoms,” said Dr. Suzanne Strasberg, president of the association.</p>
<p>“Employers need to recognize that by requiring a sick note, they are encouraging those who are experiencing their worst symptoms and are most infectious to go out, when they should just be home in bed.”</p>

</p>
<p>Toronto's Mount Sinai hospital has an outbreak of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>At a news conference today, Barbara Yaffe, Toronto's associate medical officer of health, confirmed an outbreak of H1N1 at the hospital. As well, she said they are investigating a potential outbreak at a long-term care facility.</p>
<p>“It's the only outbreak in a hospital that has been reported to us,” Dr. Yaffe told reporters. A Mount Sinai Hospital spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Donald Low, chief microbiologist at the hospital, said some health-care workers were H1N1 positive.</p>
<p>As well, Dr. Yaffe said about one out of 20 schools is reporting higher absenteeism rates, due to flu-like illness.</p>
<p>In an interview, Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai, confirmed there were three cases of influenza among patients and staff in the intensive care unit.</p>
<p>“Hospital acquired cases of influenza are happening everywhere, it's critically important we be looking for them,” Dr. McGeer said. “? This is not the least bit unexpected for us and it's been very simple to deal with because all of our staff were expecting this might happen and were ready for it.”</p>

<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>Something more frightening than ghosts and goblins may be lurking in the shadows this Halloween when kids go door-to-door or dig into their candy stash.</p>
<p>Doctors say crowded parties or communal candy bowls could potentially contribute to the spread of the H1N1 flu, but that with a little common sense children and parents should be able to avoid any unexpected scares.</p>
<p>Halloween isn't typically known as an occasion where children spread illness more than any other time, but it does combine several key risk factors for spreading the flu, says Dr. Anne Matlow, director of infection prevention and control at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children.</p>
<p>"Crowds of kids … the excitement of putting your hands in all that candy and just eating stuff as you go along and kids all crowded around the door," she says. "You add it all up, it's got the makings for something."</p>
<p>Matlow says first and foremost, kids who are not feeling well should stay home.</p>
<p>Children should avoid eating anything that is not wrapped. Attention should also be paid when children are allowed to reach into a bowl to pull out treats, because a virus on one child's hand could end up on the candy and picked up by another child.</p>
<p>Handwashing or using hand sanitizer can cut down the risk, she says.</p>
<p>"When you come home and want to sort through your candies, you should first wash your hands."</p>
<p>Parents shouldn't be worried that children could consume food contaminated with H1N1 because swallowing the virus doesn't cause infection, says Dr. Bonnie Henry, director of Public Health Emergency Management at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>That means food safety in general is usually much more of a concern around Halloween than spreading colds and flus.</p>
<p>"The one thing about Halloween is that it's outside for the most part and the virus doesn't live very long outside, so that's protective, too."</p>
<p>But Henry suggests parents might want to be a little more cautious than normal when shopping for costumes for their children.</p>
<p>A mask in a costume store could potentially be contaminated for a few hours if the last person to try it on was sick and coughed while wearing it, although the risk is low.</p>
<p>Henry suggests a better way to buy masks is for parents to visually size them up for fit and then wipe them down with a sanitizing cloth before handing them over.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The H1N1-flu death of an otherwise healthy hockey-playing teen came without warning and should serve as a lesson to parents to keep a close eye on their ill children, the boy's grief-stricken father said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Paul Frustaglio said it took barely more than a day for the H1N1 flu virus to kill Evan - his "best friend" - who turned 13 last month, a fatality that public health officials called rare.</p>
<p>"He fell so quickly," Frustaglio told The Canadian Press. "I was watching him. I was there when he died."</p>
<p>Evan's death Monday came on the same day health authorities across Canada began rolling out a vaccination program against H1N1.</p>
<p>The teen would not have been considered a priority for the flu shot because he wasn't in a high-risk group.</p>
<p>The Grade 8 student began feeling ill over the weekend during a hockey tournament in London. His symptoms included fever and some vomiting.</p>
<p>His dad took him to a walk-in clinic on Sunday afternoon, where he was seen and sent home with advice to take over-the-counter medication.</p>
<p>The family felt confident it was a simple case of flu that would soon pass.</p>
<p>That seemed to be happening. By Monday morning, his fever had broken and he was no longer nauseated. The family thought he was on the mend.</p>
<p>Evan asked to take a bath. Ten minutes later, as his horrified father watched, he suddenly went limp.</p>
<p>His father tried CPR as paramedics rushed to the west-end home.</p>
<p>"They worked on my son feverishly for over two hours," Frustaglio said. "His heart wasn't responding. The disease had taken over his heart."</p>
<p>The tragedy follows the death Saturday of a 10-year-old eastern Ontario girl from H1N1. Vanetia Warner of Cornwall was sick for several days before her condition rapidly deteriorated.</p>
<p>She died Saturday in Ottawa. It was not immediately known if she had any underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu has now killed close to 100 people across Canada. Ontario has had close to 30 deaths, six of them children, since April.</p>
<p>Most victims - about 90 per cent - had underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>"Death is a rare event, and it's a particularly rare event in young people," said Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Why the same strain of virus can cause mild symptoms in one healthy person and be lethal in another is a mystery, although its newness may be a factor.</p>
<p>"We don't have all of the answers," King said. "The key thing for all of us is to try to prevent ourselves from getting infected to begin with."</p>
<p>Frustaglio refused to criticize the walk-in clinic, saying he was in too much grief to think about what might have been done differently.</p>
<p>However, he did warn parents against complacency or thinking that patients with H1N1 flu will show symptoms for many days before deteriorating gradually.</p>
<p>"This didn't even take a day and a half - it hit my son within 10 minutes," he said.</p>
<p>"If any one of your children has any kind of flu-like symptoms, please don't take your eyes off of them. Make sure you get the medical attention you need and, if at any time, they don't seem right, especially with their breathing, just get medical attention."</p>
<p>Evan's family began taking Tamiflu after his death as a precaution and informed Evan's teammates of what had happened so they, too, could seek medical attention.</p>
<p>The Waterloo Wolves Bantam AA team – which also played at the London tournament – posted a message of condolence on its website.</p>
<p>The Wolves didn't play in the same level as Evan's Mississauga North Stars.</p>
<p>Still, the tragedy resonated with parents who had attended the tournament. "It certainly brought it home to me a little more," said Mary Kraehling, whose son Matt plays for the Wolves. "I don't think I have any more concerns because I was there, because H1N1 is everywhere. I'd already decided to get the shots for my children."</p>
<p>Paul Frustaglio's 13-year-old son Evan died within hours of exhibiting symptoms of H1N1 flu. Evan Frustaglio had mild flu symptoms that deteriorated rapidly on Monday. Nathan Denette, The Canadian Press The Canadian Press    </p>

</p>
<p>Documents obtained by The Canadian Press indicate the federal government considered vaccinating pigs against swine flu earlier this year. The Canadian Food Inspection Agency document shows Ottawa considered the vaccinations after an Alberta-based swine herd became infected last spring. Pigs can catch the virus, but there is no evidence that humans can get infected from pigs or from eating pork</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Vaccination programs continued to roll out across Canada. Officials with Alberta Health Services say demand continues to exceed expectations, with people in Edmonton and Calgary waiting more than five hours to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>The company making Canada's flu vaccine says tests show seniors have a strong response to the injection. <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> says a study done in Europe showed 88 per cent of people aged 61 to 70 and 86.7 per cent of people aged 70 to 85 saw an antibody rise that's thought to predict protection after a single dose. The vaccine in question contained an adjuvant, or a compound designed to boost the immune system's responsiveness.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Health officials in the U.S. say a shortage of pandemic vaccine appears to be easing thanks to an influx of supplies. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there are more than 22 million doses of H1N1 flu vaccine available throughout the country, up from just 14 million last week.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Officials with the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche confirm that backup goalie Peter Budaj has H1N1 flu. Budaj didn't accompany the Avalanche on their four-game road trip that began Tuesday night in Edmonton. There's a chance Budaj could rejoin the team later in the trip if he's cleared by team doctors.</p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>The local public health unit does not have the staff or the money to translate information on the H1N1 flu to accommodate the diverse ethnic communities in Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>"It's challenging because the information (from Health Canada) is coming out in real time. We have to translate that into a form that the general public can understand,'' Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, the region's associate medical officer of health, said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We are trying our best to get out the fact sheets, the things people need to know.''</p>
<p>Wang said the public health unit is relying on the provincial government, which is advertising in ethnic newspapers and running radio ads on multicultural and aboriginal radio programs across the province.</p>
<p>"Resource-wise, it's just not possible for us to translate everything we produce into all different languages. We count on the province to do it provincially, including in local communities,'' Wang said. "We are trying to do the best we can,'' she added.</p>
<p>Wang said locally, members of diverse communities can visit www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca[http://www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca] and click on the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care Influenza Self-Assessment Tool. Then click on information in other languages.</p>
<p>Information on H1N1 is available in 27 languages, including Arabic, Farsi, Spanish and Chinese.</p>
<p>Lucia Harrison, executive director of the K-W Multicultural Centre, said because the H1N1 pandemic is worldwide, many of the local ethnic communities are aware of the influenza.</p>
<p>Within her office, Harrison said many of the workers are watching their own multicultural TV programs on Arabic television and getting information on the H1N1 virus in their own language.</p>
<p>"It's all over the world and this has been so high profile. It's not a local problem. I would be more concerned if it was just local,'' she said.</p>
<p>But Harrison said she worries about smaller groups, such as the local Afghans, who might not have local radio or TV programming to inform them. Because the virus has gone global, most countries are aware of the influenza but they might not be familiar with local vaccination clinics and times.</p>

<p>Cummins Cut</p>
<p>Toronto FC dismissed interim head coach Chris Cummins Tuesday after a disappointing season that ended out of the playoffs with a 5-0 drubbing in New York.</p>
<p>Cummins' contract was not renewed.</p>
<p>Director of soccer Mo Johnston said: "We have decided to move forward without Chris for next season."</p>
<p>The team hopes to have a new head coach in place by the start of pre-season in February. Cummins' coaching record was eight wins, nine losses and seven draws in 24 matches.</p>

<p>The deadly 1918 Spanish flu is making headlines again as a new pandemic sweeps the world.</p>
<p>So far, H1N1 has proven to be far less of a force than the feared virus that ravaged the world in 1918, killing 20 million to 40 million people including 50,000 Canadians. It was almost as deadly as the First World War.</p>
<p>Called the Spanish flu because Spain alerted the world to the pandemic, it has been top of mind since H1N1 burst out in Mexico in April, quickly spread around the globe, and declared a pandemic in June by the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Both pandemics were caused by an influenza A H1N1 virus never before circulated among humans.</p>
<p>Both attacked young healthy people, unlike normal seasonal flu that primarily targets seniors and young children.</p>
<p>And both came in waves -- first appearing in the spring and coming back stronger in the fall.</p>
<p>The key difference is that H1N1 has been a lamb compared to the Spanish flu's lion.</p>
<p>So far there have been fewer than 5,000 deaths worldwide from H1N1, including more than 80 in Canada and at least four in Hamilton. It's a far cry from the one in four Canadians infected in 1918, hitting almost every family.</p>
<p>Society has so far continued to function normally in stark contrast to the mass disruption the Spanish flu caused. Hospitals were overwhelmed and nearly all public places shut down, including schools, shops, factories, courthouses, restaurants and theatres.</p>
<p>There is no question the Spanish flu devastated the world, while the jury is still out on H1N1. The federal department of health, created in 1919 because of the pandemic, is keeping a close watch on H1N1, and infusing money into research to find out more about it and how to fight it.</p>
<p>Detailed plans at every level of public health to prepare for a pandemic such as this have proven to have critical weaknesses. First and foremost has been the difficulty in diagnosing H1N1 fast, and getting a vaccine to the public in time to prevent it from spreading.</p>
<p>Conflicting information about what masks health-care workers should wear, when flu vaccines would arrive, which version of the shot is safe for pregnant women and whether handwashing works to prevent the spread has left people confused about how to protect themselves.</p>
<p>Public health officials have recently been urging the public not to use antivirals for prevention after Ontario's first case of Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 surfaced in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts remain wary of the virus because it could change at anytime and become much more deadly.</p>
<p>But they hope it will turn out to be more of a test run to show the world how far we still have to go to be truly ready the next time a pandemic such as 1918's rages.</p>

<p>Re: 'Vaccines start but some hesitate' (Oct. 26)</p>
<p>My daughter, a student at McMaster University, recently shared her fears, concerns -- and anger -- surrounding H1N1.</p>
<p>There has been a confirmed case of H1N1 on campus, and she plans to get her vaccination ASAP. She cannot adopt the philosophical, "Well, if I get sick, I get sick" attitude.</p>
<p>As a young woman with Crohn's disease and on immunosuppressant therapy, she really cannot afford to get sick. Yet she is alternately angered and horrified as students around her cough into their hands, touching shared surfaces immediately. Other young women in the public restroom play with their hair in the bathroom mirror instead of washing their hands. (I guess being a student of "higher learning" doesn't apply to common sense.)</p>
<p>So whether you get the vaccine or not -- wash your hands, use alcohol-based hand sanitizers after coughing or sneezing, or before eating. Especially if you're around high-risk populations like children or young adults.</p>
<p>Oh, and if you do experience flu-like symptoms, stay home, away from those who might have life-threatening consequences if they get sick.</p>

<p>Drug giant GlaxoSmithKline says its H1N1 flu vaccine induces a strong response in seniors, a group often left vulnerable to infections because of age-related waning of the immune system.</p>
<p>The company says a study done in Europe showed 88 per cent of people aged 61 to 70 and 86.7 per cent of people aged 70 to 85 saw an antibody rise that's thought to predict protection after a single dose of the vaccine.</p>
<p>The vaccine used in the trial contained GSK's AS03 adjuvant, an additive that boosts the immune system's response to vaccine.</p>
<p>A statement from the company says the immune response induced by the H1N1 vaccine in all age groups exceeds the criteria set out by international licensing bodies.</p>

<p>Six-year-old Hannah Dicks had been in and out of the hospital many times in her young life, but her father says she was a fighter until the H1N1 virus ravaged her tiny body.</p>
<p>Paul Dicks is mourning his daughter's death last July and says he's speaking out now to put a face on the illness and hopefully save other lives.</p>
<p>Hannah was in a Saskatoon hospital being treated for a bone disorder when she caught the swine flu.</p>
<p>Dicks says hospital staff did all they could, but he says the flu and its rapid spread caught everyone off guard.</p>
<p>The grieving father, who manages the La Ronge Hotel and Suites, says they've put in place extra cleaning measures in an effort to prevent the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>He says health officials can't do it alone and everyone needs to do a little more to win the battle against the flu.</p>

</div><div>John Kernaghan  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>428 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Hamilton's public school board is alerting community groups that use schools identified with H1N1 outbreaks.</p>
<p>That comes as a second wave of the influenza put another six public schools on the outbreak list yesterday.</p>
<p>Some 38 Hamilton Wentworth District School Board schools have now been identified by public health with outbreaks. This happens when a school has exceeded 5 per cent absenteeism due to flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>In most cases, that's linked to the H1N1 virus, according to Hamilton public health officials.</p>
<p>Many sports and community groups use public schools for evening and weekend events.</p>
<p>The alert to those groups came as the school board intensified cleaning and sanitizing at schools.</p>
<p>Meantime, a meeting of public school board officials yesterday reviewed the status of sports events given the large number of students staying home due to flu-like illness.</p>
<p>"We're waiting for direction from public health officials" about extracurricular events, said John Forbeck, HWDSB superintendent of staff and community engagement.</p>
<p>Hamilton's associate medical officer of health said his department raised concerns about student gatherings for sports and other events.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Mackie said, "school tournaments can put kids at risk" but also noted it is possible to screen students who might transmit a flu bug by sending a strong public messages for anyone with respiratory problems or flu-like symptoms to stay home.</p>
<p>Forbeck declined to provide a list of schools with outbreaks, noting it would not be fair as the list is fluid with several likely to come off the list later this week.</p>
<p>Mackie said it served no real public health interest to label schools as there are cases right across the school system.</p>
<p>In Halton, schools are not being earmarked for outbreaks but absenteeism is up dramatically from the start of the school year.</p>
<p>Dr. Bob Nosal, the medical officer of health, said in early September only one in 20 Halton schools had more than 2 per cent of students absent. That jumped to two-thirds of schools this week.</p>
<p>But he said he has not asked school officials to consider curtailing sports and special events because students will congregate elsewhere anyway. "Kids are going to get together in all kinds of ways in the community, like Halloween parties this weekend."</p>
<p>He and Mackie urged common sense, asking people with flu-like symptoms to stay away from all gatherings.</p>

</p>
<p>How do I know if I should go to the emergency department?</p>
<p>Go to the ER if you develop:</p>
<p>* difficulty breathing or shortness of breath when doing very little or resting</p>
<p>* purple or blue lips</p>
<p>* continuous vomiting or severe diarrhea, especially with signs of dehydration such as dizziness, absence of urination or, in infants, a lack of tears when they cry</p>
<p>* confusion or disorientation</p>
<p>* stiff neck or seizures</p>
<p>Should I send my child to school if there is an outbreak there?</p>
<p>Yes. A healthy child can go to school -- the flu virus is everywhere.</p>
<p>How can I minimize my exposure to the H1N1 flu virus?</p>
<p>* Wash your hands often and thoroughly with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds or use alcohol-based hand sanitizers with at least 60 per cent alcohol.</p>
<p>* Keep your hands away from your face.</p>
<p>* Avoid large crowds where viruses can spread easily. Stay home if you're sick.</p>
<p>* Get immunized.</p>
<p>* Keep common surfaces such as doorknobs and telephones clean and disinfected.</p>
<p>* Eat healthy foods and stay physically active to keep your immune system strong.</p>
<p>Who is eligible to get the vaccine this week?</p>
<p>Anyone at high risk of developing complications:</p>
<p>* people under 65 with chronic medical conditions such as heart or kidney disease, blood disorders, diabetes, asthma, chronic lung disease and severe obesity</p>
<p>* expectant mothers more than 20 weeks pregnant and breastfeeding women</p>
<p>* children six months to five years old</p>
<p>* health-care workers who will be exposed to H1N1 in their work</p>
<p>* caregivers and others in contact with high-risk people who can't be immunized, such as babies under six months</p>
<p>Why is it so important for pregnant women to be immunized?</p>
<p>Pregnant women who get any type of flu have a greater chance of serious health problems and are at higher risk for severe illness with H1N1.</p>
<p>Can I wait for the unadjuvanted vaccine?</p>
<p>Unadjuvanted vaccine, which is not yet available, is only for pregnant women. An adjuvant is a substance added to a vaccine to boost immunity. The World Health Organization recommends pregnant women get the unadjuvanted vaccine where possible, but adjuvanted vaccine could be used if necessary.</p>

</p>
<p>There's an H1N1 outbreak at my children's school.</p>
<p>We knew it was inevitable. But we hoped it would happen AFTER we'd been vaccinated.</p>
<p>We'd pretty-much-almost-for-sure made up our minds to have our family vaccinated. I think. My husband was in favour a long time ago. I'm more skeptical.</p>
<p>The deal breaker came Monday when we got e-mails and crumpled letters in the bottom of knapsacks from Hamilton Public Health Services saying a number of students at our school "have recently become ill with respiratory symptoms such as fever, cough or sore throat."</p>
<p>It doesn't actually say it's H1N1. But the number provided for information is the H1N1 hotline.</p>
<p>So I call.</p>
<p>It's 9:30 a.m. and the lines are jammed. I get through to a woman trying to be helpful. But really, most of what she knows is not by virtue of working the hotline. The hotline call takers are not medical professionals. They are city workers commandeered to answer phones, armed with a fact sheet about clinic times and locations.</p>
<p>Most of what this woman knows comes from being a mom with two kids in the school system.</p>
<p>We compare notes.</p>
<p>One of her girlfriends on Facebook has kids at a Burlington school, she tells me, with 160 kids out.</p>
<p>"Letters go home from a school at 5 per cent (infection rate)," she says and "I thought it was 40 per cent and they would consider closing the school."</p>
<p>The hotline woman is wrong.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health, says closing a school isn't about numbers. It's about severity. If H1N1 is causing serious medical distress -- even if only a handful of students and staff are affected -- he would likely shut it down.</p>
<p>I am transferred to an answering machine in the Infectious Disease department. I leave a message asking about my five-year-old son's eligibility for a high-priority vaccination. Kids four and under can get it now. But he uses a puffer for frequent bronchial infections. Does that make him a candidate? Do I need to bring documentation? I'd hate to get to the front of that long, long line only to find I don't have the proper paperwork. I like to be prepared.</p>
<p>For instance, I've put little bottles of sanitizer in my children's backpacks. I know my seven-year-old uses it. She has become an expert on germs thanks to a science unit that has incorporated H1N1 into the curriculum.</p>
<p>At dinner the other night, she rhymed off seven children in her class who are home sick. Even more sobering is that she has got wind that some children have died from H1N1. She wants to know if that will happen to her. I assure her it won't. It breaks my heart to hear her ask.</p>
<p>My son is doing his part to stave off H1N1. He sings Twinkle Twinkle Little Star while washing his hands for the duration.</p>
<p>In the school yard, parents cluster to talk about the outbreak. "Are you vaccinating?" replaces the standard greeting.</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon I still don't have answers about my son and the priority vaccinations. (I never do get a call back.) So I take a chance, pick him up from school and drive to the vaccination site at a Dundas church.</p>
<p>We find a parking spot two blocks away. Cops direct traffic and help hundreds of people -- mostly moms with children -- cross the road. We take our spot in line.</p>
<p>My son is his usual good-natured self and I am grateful. Some moms have brought toys and snacks. I came straight from work and have no supplies. Luckily, I have his puffer with me. Proof, if I need it.</p>
<p>For the first hour we wait outdoors. Someone brings me two long forms and a clipboard. Good news! Not only can my son get his shot, but since I am here, they'll do mine, too. Now I wish I'd brought my daughter and husband as well.</p>
<p>For the second hour we snake through the inside of the church.</p>
<p>By now, I am fast friends with two other moms. We take turns holding each others' place in line for bathroom breaks. We talk about the asthma and bronchial infections that make our kids high risk. We share our struggle with the decision to vaccinate. We recognize that we -- middle-aged women -- are in fact the highest risk group with the greatest mortality rate.</p>
<p>Ninety minutes in it is our turn for the shots.</p>
<p>We enter the gym full of nurses and needles. I roll up my sleeve and go first. My son squeezes my hand "for bravery."</p>
<p>He loses his nerve after that and joins the cacophony of crying and screaming children. The nurse is lovely and patient. She says she is sorry for hurting him. I think she really means it.</p>
<p>A yellow sucker and snuggles calm things while we wait our required 20 minutes to be sure there are no immediate side-effects.</p>
<p>Worn out by the ordeal, my little guy is unusually quiet on the drive home. I watch him like a hawk and don't have the heart to tell him he needs another shot in 21 days.</p>
<p>We get home and my husband walks in the door with our daughter.</p>
<p>Her tummy hurts.</p>

</p>
<p>Hamilton is considering opening specialized H1N1 assessment centres as family doctors and hospitals strain against a surge of patients with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Local hospital emergency rooms, family doctors and ambulance dispatch centres all reported a significant increase in demand yesterday as the second wave of the H1N1 virus spreads.</p>
<p>"For now the system is coping," said Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, the city's medical officer of health. "But we need to be ready with an alternative if that coping falls down."</p>
<p>Signs of stress were evident throughout the city's health-care system yesterday:</p>
<p>* The number of people hospitalized with H1N1 in Hamilton went from 17 Monday to 27 yesterday, Richardson said;</p>
<p>* Ambulance services experienced a prolonged "code zero" situation, when one or no ambulances are available to respond to emergencies;</p>
<p>* Family physicians associated with Hamilton Health Sciences reported a 30 per cent increase in patient demand even after postponing non-essential appointments, such as annual physicals.</p>
<p>The city will finalize plans for the assessment centres over the next few days and will be ready to open the doors if the system becomes overwhelmed, Richardson said.</p>
<p>It would be the first time the city has taken the step. An assessment centre was established to handle patients during the SARS crisis but it never opened.</p>
<p>Plans are in place to provide two kinds of centres: one for patients with flu symptoms who can't get an appointment with a family doctor, and a second for patients requiring more significant care but "who don't need all the resources of an emergency room," Richardson said.</p>
<p>Specialized assessment centres were set up in Kingston yesterday after patient loads overwhelmed emergency rooms and family doctors, she said.</p>
<p>But not everyone is keen on the idea. The clinics would likely be staffed by family doctors who are already struggling to manage their own practices, said Dr. David Price, chief of family medicine at Hamilton Health Sciences.</p>
<p>"I know they've had to do this elsewhere but we really hope we won't get there," Price said.</p>
<p>At St. Joseph's Healthcare, administrators worried about a potential "double whammy" of patients and staff coming down with the flu.</p>
<p>"It's already a significant burden on the emergency department to do this work on top of the other work we have to do," said Dr. David Higgins, chief of staff at St. Joseph's. "The number of cases in the community are rising rapidly and our staff live in the community."</p>
<p>Halton is also experiencing significant stress on its emergency rooms, but has no plans for stand-alone assessment centres. If the situation becomes much worse, the region will establish secondary emergency rooms within hospitals to handle only flu patients, said Halton medical officer of health Dr. Bob Nosal.</p>
<p>Hospitals received their first shipment of the H1N1 vaccine yesterday to be doled out to front-line health-care workers. St. Joseph's received 1,000 doses for its staff of 4,000 workers.</p>
<p>The province delivered 23,000 doses of the vaccine to Hamilton on Friday. A second shipment of 26,000 doses was expected this weekend but hasn't yet arrived, said Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"We are expecting the next 28,000 (doses) within the next day or two," Mackie said. "But until we have it, we don't have it."</p>
<p>Mackie hopes to make the vaccine available to all health-care workers within a week. If enough additional doses of the flu shot arrive, local vaccination clinics could open to the public as early as Monday.</p>
<p>Niagara's public health department has confirmed plans to open their clinic to the general public on Monday.</p>
<p>In the meantime, health officials are urging residents with moderate symptoms to call TeleHealth Ontario (1-866-797-0000) before going to their doctor.</p>
<p>People with underlying health problems or experiencing significant dizziness or shortness of breath should go to the hospital, Mackie said.</p>
<p>"We are absolutely relying on the public to be thoughtful about when they are seeking care," he said. "If everybody who gets the flu goes to see their doctor it will completely overwhelm the system."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Schools send home hundreds; Epidemic seems to be gaining speed. 200 students absent at Kuper Academy</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN, BRENDA BRANSWELL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>780 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Several Montreal schools sent hundreds of children home yesterday with H1N1 flu symptoms - fever and dry cough - fanning fears that the swine flu epidemic has picked up speed in the city.</p>
<p>Among the worst hit was Kuper Academy in Kirkland, where an estimated 200 children were either sent home yesterday or kept at home by anxious parents.</p>
<p>The Montreal Health and Social Services Agency, which has asked schools to report an absentee rate of higher than 10 per cent, yesterday refused to provide details on the status of the virus activity on the island, including the current number of confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>It's not clear how many schools are being emptied of students, but the Kuper exodus comes in the wake a Toronto teen's death from the virus. Evan Frustaglio, 13, died Monday evening in a hospital 48 hours after developing minor cold symptoms.</p>
<p>The agency's information shutdown comes after its mass vaccination campaign got off to a shaky start Monday, with shipping and handling delays keeping inoculations from being performed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the agency was to finish the process of delivering the rest of the initial batch of doses, intended for the first group of about 90,000 people on the vaccination list - first responders, health workers and the gravely ill.</p>
<p>The agency has called the media to its head office on St. Denis St. this morning for a briefing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some parents of children at Kuper Academy say the outbreak started last week.</p>
<p>It's not clear how many teachers are now absent because of illness, but at least five went home yesterday.</p>
<p>"The school is trying to keep this down," said one parent who spoke on condition that her name not be used. When her own child came down with flu symptoms on the weekend, the school social worker sent her an email confirming that at least 145 other high school children are ill.</p>
<p>Kuper Academy has one confirmed case of swine flu, school head Joan Salette said.</p>
<p>The school reported 180 cases of absenteeism because of flu symptoms to the public health department of the Montreal health agency, Salette said.</p>
<p>"They told me there were five viruses circulating and that it could be any one of them," she said. "But they're not recommending people go to the hospital - just go to your physician, and if he thinks you've got it, he'll give you the Tamiflu."</p>
<p>People are panicking, especially parents of children with underlying health conditions, Salette said. "I'm following government guidelines and telling the kids, 'If you're healthy, come to school, we have classes as usual. And if not, stay home for seven days, you'll be given a chance to make up your work.' "</p>
<p>Sir Wilfrid Laurier School Board, which covers Laval, Lanaudière and the Laurentians, does not have any confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>But one of its elementary schools in Rosemere has reported student absenteeism of over 18 per cent. Parents are playing it safe and keeping children with flu-like symptoms home, said Maxeen Joline, a board spokesperson.</p>
<p>"They're very much aware of the situation, so they're not taking any chances," she said.</p>
<p>Federal and provincial health authorities do not recommend that schools be closed during an epidemic, saying it won't stop the virus from spreading.</p>
<p>A chemical smell of antiseptic filled the air as Montreal's first batch of H1N1 vaccinations got going yesterday for health workers at CSSS Dorval-Lachine-LaSalle, which received 2,500 doses.</p>
<p>Family physician Jessica Svitek was first in line.</p>
<p>"Lower your shoulder - on the count of three - un, deux, trois, ça pique," said nurse Christiane Lajoie before landing the syringe. "Did you feel something?"</p>
<p>The program is voluntary and no health worker is obliged to be immunized, but several medical associations have asked their members to get the shot.</p>
<p>"I did it out of a social conscience," Svitek said. "If we (doctors) get sick, how can we help others?"</p>
<p>Confusion over H1N1 has led to many questions from patients at her clinic, Svitek said: "They fear the vaccine but they also don't know what will happen with the pandemic. I recommend they get it, even those who claim they never get sick, because the data is reassuring."</p>

<p>Colorado Avalanche backup goalie Peter Budaj has been diagnosed with swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The team's head coach, Joe Sacco, confirmed the illness after practice Tuesday morning in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Budaj missed his scheduled first start of the season last Friday because of the flu.</p>
<p>"We've taken the necessary steps, the necessary precautions, to keep him away from the guys at the right time," Sacco said to the Denver Post. "Hopefully, he'll be joining us on this trip."</p>
<p>Tyler Weiman, recalled from Lake Erie last week, will replace Budaj behind starter Craig Anderson.</p>

<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>526 words</div><div>28 October 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>With the H1N1 virus being linked to two deaths in recent days of Ontario children 13 and under, a spokeswoman for the Canadian Paediatric Society says parents should be honest with their kids about the virus and try to keep them calm.</p>
<p>Parents have an arsenal of information at their fingertips to keep their families as safe as possible from H1N1, but with otherwise healthy kids dying from H1N1 complications, federal health authorities and pediatric experts are stressing the importance of the H1N1 vaccine and education.</p>
<p>"For children, you have to explain, 'Yes it hurts, but then it's over with,' and then it protects you from getting much sicker," said Dr. Danielle Grenier, medical affairs director for the Canadian Paediatric Society. "Be honest, and get it done -- that's No.1.</p>
<p>"You need to explain that you can get sick with the flu, but if you get the vaccine [your chances] are going down ... You have to be very positive and stay away from alarming them ... They need that reassurance and know that their parents will do everything they can for them."</p>
<p>On Monday, 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio -- a minor hockey player from Toronto -- died of H1N1 after falling ill on Sunday. In a separate case, an eastern Ontario pre-teen girl died in an Ottawa hospital after getting the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Grenier said getting vaccinated is the safest way to protect entire families and strongly recommended that parents of young children consider getting the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>"This is the circle of care -- everybody who is around that child should be vaccinated to protect that child," said Grenier, who has been practising child medicine for 31 years. "That's the most important thing because they are considered a high-risk group.</p>
<p>"If you have a child under five years old, and you're a parent, that child is in an at-risk group and you as a parent need to be vaccinated to protect your own."</p>
<p>Grenier also recommends children spend more time playing outside instead of hanging out in closed spaces, such as shopping malls, to keep themselves better protected against the virus.</p>
<p>She said the virus will thrive in closed areas -- despite people's best efforts to wash their hands and follow other recommendations outlined by the Public Health Agency of Canada and other authorities -- making it hard for people to avoid unless they get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"This is a new virus, so when it gets in a closed space -- either a school, a daycare or a work space -- if you're not vaccinated, it will spread across the board," said Grenier, who added the majority of her patients are getting vaccinated against H1N1.</p>
<p>"It's a good, safe vaccine and it protects 93 to 97 per cent. If you get this virus and get the complications of pneumonia, there's nothing I can give you to make you better, and you'll say, 'I should have [had a shot].'</p>
<p>"If we want to protect our loved ones, there's only one way."</p>

<p>CP RAIL PROFIT FALLS 29%</p>
<p>VANCOUVER -<span class="companylink">Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd</span>. reported a better than expected 29-percent drop in quarterly operating earnings Tuesday, though cost cuts were not enough to offset a drop in traffic volumes.</p>
<p>The company, which operates in both Canada and the northern United States, said income fell to $144 million, or 85 cents a share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, down from$184 million, or $1.19 a share, a year earlier. Quarterly revenue fell 20 per cent to $1.1 billion.</p>
<p>Analysts had expected a profit of 78 cents a share on revenue of $1.07 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.</p>
<p>THE BEAR'S OWNER POSTS LOSS</p>
<p>TORONTO -Specialty-TV and radio company <span class="companylink">Astral Media Inc</span>. posted a quarterly loss on Tuesday as revenue slumped and it booked a noncash $317.5-million impairment charge on its radio broadcast licences.</p>
<p>Astral, whose Edmonton radio stations include The Bear, EZ Rock and The Team, said it lost $273.6 million, or $4.87 a share, in the three months ended Aug. 31. That was down from a profit of $38.9 million, or 68 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>Revenue fell to $219.4 million from $229.9 million a year earlier, the company said. Montreal-based Astral became Canada's biggest radio broadcaster in 2007 when it bought Standard Radio for$1.1 billion.</p>
<p>POTASH CORP. SALE A 'STRETCH'</p>
<p>LONDON -<span class="companylink">BHP Billiton Ltd</span>., the world's biggest mining company, is unlikely to purchase a leading potash producer because a takeover would put pressure on its finances, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse Group AG</span> said.</p>
<p>Buying <span class="companylink">Potash Corp. of Saskatchewan Inc</span>. or Mosaic Co. would leave BHP at risk of "stretching its healthy balance sheet," Paul McTaggart, an analyst at <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> in Sydney, wrote in a report. Acquiring either company also would bring units with activities unrelated to potash, according to McTaggart, who has a "neutral" recommendation on BHP.</p>
<p>Still, buying either Potash Corp. or Mosaic for cash and stock would boost per-share profit after two years and provide earnings margins of about 40 per cent, he added.</p>
<p>BHP spokesman Illtud Harri declined to comment. Chief executive Marius Kloppers said in August the Melbourne-based company would spend "billions of dollars" to develop its Jansen project in Canada, which is near mines belonging to Potash Corp. and Mosaic.</p>
<p>FLU VACCINE PLANT PLANNED</p>
<p>TORONTO -Biotechnology company Microbix Biosystems says it will partner with a state-owned Chinese drugmaker to build Asia's largest flu vaccine plant.</p>
<p>The Toronto-based company said it formed a joint venture with Hunan Biopharmaceutical Co to build and operate the $200-million-US facility near Changsha City.</p>
<p>The plant, the third-largest vaccine plant in the world, will be able to produce more than 100 million doses of seasonal influenza vaccine a year, and up to 300 million doses of a vaccine to prevent pandemic influenza, including the H1N1 flu virus, when it is fully operational by 2013. Construction is scheduled to begin in early 2010.</p>
<p>U.S. DEAL FOR FORMER QUEBECOR</p>
<p>MONTREAL -Commercial printer Worldcolor, formerly Quebecor World, said Tuesday it has signed a multi-year pact with Macmillan U.S. to print a total of 800 million trade bestsellers, textbooks and paperbacks and including warehouse and distribution services. The pact renews and expands a long-standing contractual between Worldcolor and the prestige publisher.</p>
<p>MacMillan said it sees rising demand for shorter runs, faster production turns, better distribution and innovative technology.</p>
<p>KINROSS CUTS OUTPUT FORECAST</p>
<p>TORONTO -<span class="companylink">Kinross Gold Corp</span>. lowered its full-year 2009 production outlook and raised its forecast for cost of sales, prompting analysts to lower earnings and output forecasts for the gold miner, which sent the shares down almost five per cent Tuesday.</p>
<p>The revised outlook is due partly to a slower-than-expected ramp-up at Kinross's Paracatu mine in Brazil, the company said late Monday.</p>
<p>Kinross said it made progress in the third quarter in increasing productivity at Paracatu, but that it continues to face challenges in achieving efficiency and output targets.</p>
<p>MONSTERS TOO LATE FOR STUDIO</p>
<p>LOS ANGELES -<span class="companylink">DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc</span>. said third-quarter profit declined 48 per cent after its Monsters vs. Aliens DVD was released too late to lift sales.Netincome fell to $19.6 million US, or</p>
<p>23 cents a share, from$37.4 million, or 41 cents, a year earlier, the company said Tuesday. Excluding a gain, profit of 20 cents topped the 19-cent average 17 analysts' estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Sales fell 11 per cent to $135.4 million, beating the $127.9 million average of estimates.</p>
<p>DreamWorks Animation is increasing production to three movies next year. The DVD for Monsters vs. Aliens, this year's only film, didn't reach stores until Sept. 29, one day before the quarter ended. As a result, much of the revenue will be booked in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>AMERICANS' MOOD DIPS</p>
<p>NEW YORK -Confidence among U.S. consumers fell unexpectedly in October for a second month as Americans fretted about a lack of jobs. The Conference Board's confidence index dropped to 47.7 from a revised 53.4 in September, a report from the New York-based private research group showed Tuesday. A measure of employment availability deteriorated to a 26-year low.</p>
<p>IBM BOOSTS SHARE BUYBACK</p>
<p>NEW YORK -International Business Machines Corp., the world's largest computer-services provider, will add $5 billion US to its plan to repurchase stock, rewarding shareholders after back-to-back quarters of profit gains.</p>
<p>The increase, following the stock's 43-percent jump this year, adds to the$4.2 billion left in IBM's original buyback program at the end of September.</p>
<p>IBM said it has returned more than $70 billion US to shareholders in the past six years. This month the company raised its forecast for annual earnings to at least $9.85 a share after posting a 14-per-cent gain in profit for the third quarter.</p>
<p>U.S. HOME PRICES UP AGAIN</p>
<p>NEW YORK -Home prices in 20 U.S. cities rose in August for a third consecutive month, bolstering the case that an economic recovery is at hand. The S&P/Case-Shiller home-price index climbed one per cent from the prior month, seasonally adjusted, after a 1.2-per-cent increase in July, the group said Tuesday. From a year earlier, the gauge fell 11.3 per cent, less than forecast.</p>

</p>
<p>While Peter Budaj recovers in Denver from the swine flu, Craig Anderson has been on fire.</p>
<p>Anderson has been one of the hottest NHL goalies in the season's first month, playing every minute of the Colorado Avalanche's 12 games, proving that stopping pucks is the only position where teams don't write you off the older you get.</p>
<p>Anderson, the league's best free-agent signing at a salary-cap hit of $1.8 million US over two years, has patiently bided his time to be the go-to guy in net. He was originally drafted by Calgary in 1999, but the Flames didn't sign him and he went back into the draft in 2001, when the Chicago Blackhawks took him. He was on waivers three times in less than three weeks in 2006 and belonged to the Boston Bruins, Chicago, the St. Louis Blues and Florida Panthers in a six-month span.</p>
<p>He lived in Sweden and inserted a double-s in the middle of his surname to to fit in. When he played for the Blackhawks, he had an incorrect spelling on the name bar of his jersey until the NHL, as he says, "questioned the legality of it."</p>
<p>He has never played more than 31 games in a season, but he might play 60 or more this year. He's been so good, the folks picking Team USA for the 2010 Olympics have had their eyes opened wide. He wasn't at their summer camp but he's in the picture now, with Ryan Miller, Tim Thomas and Jonathan Quick.</p>
<p>He emerged from Tuesday's contest with a 3-0 victory, his second shutout of the season and a 1.99 goals-against average while facing an average of 34 shots a game.</p>
<p>"I don't think you're ever too old to be a (starting NHL) goalie ... when you think about it, there's only 30 spots and sometimes you might have to wait and sit on the bench for five or six years," said Anderson.</p>
<p>"All I know is, when you get the opportunity, you'd better make the most of it before some other kid takes that opportunity from you ... the advantage when you're older is you hopefully know more about the game. You learn tendencies of shooters, not to do too much, just worry about doing the job you're supposed to do, not everybody else's. Once you figure that out, the game gets easier."</p>
<p>Anderson had no problem with his lot in life in Florida, knowing Tomas Vokoun had paid more NHL dues and got more rope as a starter than the backup.</p>
<p>"You earn that ... you put together a couple of good seasons of 60 or 70 games, and that (respect) comes," Anderson said.</p>
<p>Same with the Olympic team snub. He wasn't upset that the U.S. Olympic squad passed on him for the camp in Chicago.</p>
<p>"Thomas and Miller are both really good starters, and Quick played 50 or so games last year in L.A. The ball's in their (U. S. Olympic management) court now. If I do my job, and they choose me to go along, that would great. If not, that's their decision," he said.</p>
<p>Anderson wasn't about to re-sign with the Florida Panthers, who are paying Vokoun $5.7 million a year, when he hit the free-agent market. He was good last year, with a 2.71 average, but the clock was ticking. Colorado called on the second day of free-agency.</p>
<p>"We had a few teams pegged that we wanted to talk to ... I wasn't afraid I wouldn't get an NHL job somewhere. I thought I could be a backup on all 30 teams, but it was great Colorado called. They wanted a guy to battle for the No. 1 job," he said.</p>
<p>Budaj had been a little maddening --often excellent, but with a tendency to give up a suspect goal--so the Avs took a shot on Anderson. He has carried them so far, even if many are waiting for the wheels to fall off this young hard-working team.</p>
<p>"We tighten the lug-nuts every day to make sure they're on tight," joked Anderson, who's riding the wave along with everybody else.</p>
<p>When the guys in front of the net-minder believe their puck-stopper is as good as the guy in the opposing net, it's a safety blanket. They know he's not going to give up a goal from the boards, or a floater with no screen. Anderson has been rock solid.</p>
<p>"If you're talking about a 28-year-old forward, if you make the NHL, then that's rare, but goalies take longer to establish themselves," said Colorado coach Joe Sacco.</p>
<p>"Andy's in the prime of his career. He's got the opportunity and he's running with it. I think he's on a mission to be not just a No. 1 goalie, but one of the best (in the NHL)."</p>
