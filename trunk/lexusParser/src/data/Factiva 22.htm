<p>Like most of us, I had been closely following the rollout of vaccination services relating to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>As I have a daughter with asthma, I was hopeful of having her inoculated as soon as practical. I must admit, I was not looking forward to the process of her inoculation, based on media reports.</p>
<p>What I found Tuesday at the Kanata Recreation Centre's clinic was caring, committed, positive people, who made the process of wait times and needle procedure as painless as possible.</p>
<p>The front line workers have my admiration and thanks for doing a great job with what they have -- you are all my heroes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Efficient CHEO emergency staff help to cure my flu worries</b>

<p>It was such a relief to find out that our Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa is so efficient in handling the current crisis. The staff are sensitive to parents concerned when our children get very sick, especially our fears about the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>With all the bad news we hear I think it would be well appreciated and reassuring for all parents to know that CHEO is doing an incredible job at their emergency department.</p>
<p>My five-year-old daughter had a high fever of 40 Celcius (104 F) for three days since Saturday as well as very sore throat and sore, aching muscles -- well, I thought it might be this flu. I decided to go to CHEO as a precaution.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, the ER nurses and doctors were amazing and friendly as well as very well organized to deal with so many different cases. No one except the sick and one parent could go past the hospital checkpoints.</p>
<p>The CHEO prevention measures were great: sanitizers everywhere; gloves, mask obligatory and an escort to take your child to a dedicated room.</p>
<p>The CHEO doctor and several nurses thoroughly examined Anne-Marie. They initially said she probably had a "moderate" case of H1N1 flu. And they also thought she would be all right to come home where she could recuperate and be watched for improvements.</p>
<p>At the hospital, they took a swab of her throat. Within 24 hours, I was impressed to get a telephone call from a CHEO nurse who said the test showed Anne-Marie had strep throat. The nurse even asked how she was doing and if her fever had gone down.</p>
<p>Honestly, I want to let the public know that as a mother of four young children, I am very proud of our CHEO hospital and thankful for all the staff who are working extremely hard and long hours for us.</p>
<p>Thank you for all your help and dedication to our children throughout this crisis.</p>

<div>H1N1 ask a virologist</div>
<div>Saturday Observer</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Do I have the flu?; Here's how to tell As one of Ontario's H1N1 hotspots, Ottawa is seeing more people, not only with flu-like illnesses, but all kinds of respiratory infections. How do you tell a common cold from the flu? And how do you tell the difference between a seasonal flu and H1N1? University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown explains the tell-tale symptoms of flu and lists some of the warning signs of the H1N1 virus that require urgent medical attention.</b>

</p>
<p>How do I tell the difference between a cold and the flu?</p>
<p>The typical feature of a cold or other respiratory infections is that it starts with a tickle in the throat, followed by coughing and a runny nose. With a head cold, much of the congestion is in the nose and throat, which causes more sneezing. The flu comes with several telltale symptoms. Chief among them is a fever, cough as well as aches and pains. "Generally, fever and flu go together like a hand in a glove," says Brown. "Typical flu will put you in bed. In the Middle Ages, they called it knock-me-down fever. And that's one of the key differentiations. If you're not so sick that you have to go to bed, that often means maybe it's not influenza. Influenza pretty well always knocks you off your feet. You're just so sick, you can't get up."</p>
<p>Do I have the flu if I don't have a fever?</p>
<p>Fever is a hallmark of flu, often rising abruptly to 38 C at the onset of illness. But fever isn't appearing in all H1N1 cases, an odd feature of the new virus, which can make it more difficult to control the epidemic. U.S. medical experts who examined patients in Mexico City at the start of the H1N1 pandemic found that about a third of them who showed up at two hospitals had no fever when they were initially screened. Brown said some people with H1N1 develop fever several days after the cough and aches have started. If you don't have a fever, you likely don't have the flu.</p>
<p>How do I tell the difference between the seasonal flu and H1N1?</p>
<p>The symptoms of H1N1 are similar to those of seasonal flu: cough, sore throat, fever, headache, muscle ache, loss of appetite, runny nose, joint pain and fatigue. However, more people with H1N1 appear to experience vomiting and diarrhea than is usual in seasonal-flu cases. Scientists are not sure what causes this response. Generally, flu "really stimulates your immune system," says Brown. "Your joints ache, your head aches, your muscles ache, and that's the immune system sending out its mediators, which cause inflammation all over your body. And a lot of those inflammatory signals can cause vomiting and diarrhea." However, vomiting and diarrhea on their own is gastroenteritis, which is commonly mistaken for flu.</p>
<p>What are the warning signs of flu that warrant immediate medical attention?</p>
<p>Panting, rapid breathing, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing. "Congestion is not enough," says Brown. "It's got to be difficulty getting those breaths. When you have nasal congestion, you can still mouth-breathe. But if you're mouth-breathing and that's not working, that means something's not working down there."</p>
<p>A clear warning sign is if a person's complexion is grey or their lips appear blue. Another warning sign is if someone is extremely lethargic, isn't making sense or appears disoriented. You should also start to worry if you recover from a fever and a cough, only to feel worse almost immediately. "That's a sign that you've got a secondary bacterial infection," says Brown. "The influenza makes you sick, damages your airways and before they can repair, bacteria from your throat slides down, doesn't get cleaned out and starts to grow, leading to bacterial pneumonia."</p>
<p>Which parts of the respiratory system does the H1N1 virus infect compared to seasonal flu?</p>
<p>Seasonal flu viruses infect the cells lining the main airway and nasal tract. What makes the H1N1 virus different from most seasonal flu viruses is that while it also infects the airway, in some people, it penetrates deeper down, infecting the lungs as well. "It's affecting the ability of the lungs to work," says Brown. "That's why you have to breathe faster. You're not getting your oxygen through your lungs." Because the H1N1 virus causes lung infection more completely, some people have ended up in intensive care units. Others have died from the virus.</p>
<p>How long can the H1N1 virus infect others?</p>
<p>Once the virus enters the nose, eyes or throat and begins to grow, symptoms can start to develop between 24 to 48 hours after initial infection. In some cases, however, it can take up to a week for symptoms to develop. People with H1N1 typically spend between two and four days in bed with a fever. Once the fever breaks, the virus is gone. With the H1N1 virus, the fever can last a little longer, says Brown. For parents trying to figure out how long they should keep their sick children out of school, a good rule of thumb is to keep a sick child at home for a full week, keeping in mind that the virus can be around for up to seven days after a person shows symptoms.</p>

<p>A second person has been fired by Alberta Health Services for involvement in the decision to give the Calgary Flames and their families the H1N1 vaccine last week.</p>
<p>A statement released Friday by the health authority detailed how the hockey players got their shots without having to stand in hours-long lineups.</p>
<p>A medical representative for the team approached Alberta Health Services on Oct. 27 to see if an H1N1 immunization clinic would be made available to the Flames and their families, according to the statement.</p>
<p>"The request was forwarded to a more senior AHS staff member, who in turn took it to a supervisor and the request was approved."</p>
<p>The clinic for the players and their families was held on Oct. 30 in Calgary, one day before the province closed the immunization clinics to those outside the priority groups.</p>
<p>"There is no written record of approval to proceed and there is no process for authorization of the use of the H1N1 vaccine for this purpose ..." the statement says. "Use of the vaccine was not discussed or authorized above the level of the individual who authorized its use."</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the most senior staff member involved was fired.</p>

<p>Three Ottawa area hospitals are holding one-day H1N1 vaccination clinics for pregnant women only, though two of them are only for women who have already registered to give birth there.</p>
<p>The clinics will be today, between 8 a.m. and 4 p.m., at the Montfort Hospital, a seniors-oriented facility run by the Queensway Carleton Hospital, and The Ottawa Hospital's Riverside campus.</p>
<p>The Queensway Carleton and Montfort sites are additions to the plan announced earlier in the week by public-health authorities, and are restricted to women registered to have their babies at those hospitals. The Riverside clinic is open to all pregnant women.</p>
<p>All three clinics will offer expectant mothers the choice of a non-adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine, or the adjuvanted version.</p>
<p>The unadjuvanted shot does not contain a chemical immune booster, which typically increases a vaccine's potency.</p>
<p>But because there is little hard scientific evidence about the safety and effectiveness of adjuvanted vaccines in pregnant women, the Public Health Agency of Canada is giving expectant mothers, who might otherwise choose not to be vaccinated, the option of getting an unadjuvanted vaccine.</p>
<p>The tradeoff is, the unadjuvanted vaccine could be less effective in pregnant women, who tend to have weaker immune systems.</p>
<p>Early results of clinical trials done by the vaccine's manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, show the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine protects nine out of 10 healthy adults who get it; the unadjuvanted vaccine protects six out of 10 who get it.</p>

</p>
<p>First it was hockey players. Now, wealthy hospital donors have jumped the queue to get H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>On Friday, news emerged that the top 200 donors at Montreal's Jewish General Hospital have already been inoculated.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, board members of Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital were offered H1N1 flu shots at a regularly scheduled board of governors meeting Oct. 26, says the union representing 46,000 health care workers in Ontario.</p>
<p>"The message this is sending is that the wealthy and influential should be treated first," said Pat Chastang, a spokeswoman for the Service Employees International Union Local 1 Canada, "even if it means pregnant women and children must be made to wait." The Ontario union urged all 65 of Mount Sinai's board members, who received their vaccinations on Oct. 26, to resign. "The most important quality of a board member are their ethics and their integrity. Clearly, jumping the queue was a mistake," said Chastang.</p>
<p>A statement from the hospital said the vaccinations were given during a clinic that was open to the general public during a time where no shortages had been announced.</p>
<p>"The focus was on inoculating health-care workers, patients, and any member of the public who requested the vaccine. No one would be turned away; it was understood there was sufficient vaccine available," said the statement on Mount Sinai's website.</p>
<p>In Montreal, a spokeswoman for the Jewish General Hospital said all 200 donors who received H1N1 shots serve as volunteers in some capacity.</p>
<p>"It has nothing to do with the fact that they gave money," said Karen Ohayon. "There's absolutely no link." However, Marie-Eve Bédard, press attache to Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc, said board members of hospitals and donors are not entitled to vaccines ahead of the rest of the population.</p>
<p>"There has been a gap in communication because this morning we learned that certain (hospital) boards of directors were vaccinated, which the minister considers unacceptable," Bédard said.</p>
<p>The revelations come as the World Health Organization warned "intense and persistent" flu transmission continues to be reported in North America, "without evidence of a peak in activity." Meanwhile, hospitals, schools and businesses are grappling with absenteeism. And workers with the Alberta government have been told that they will need to swear a legal oath that they had H1N1 if they miss more than three days of work.</p>
<p>The policy is meant to ease the pressure on family doctors by removing the need for medical notes during the outbreak, said government spokesman Gerald Kastendieck.</p>

<p>When it comes to the next phase in the H1N1 immunization campaign, public health authorities will have to go to the people, says an expert in crisis management.</p>
<p>But Ottawa's public health authorities have already decided not to offer the influenza vaccine in schools, and say workplaces are not authorized to immunize employees.</p>
<p>In getting the mass of people vaccinated who aren't in especially vulnerable groups, the public health message that urges everyone to get a shot will come up against a public that expects services to be quick and convenient, said Alan Middleton,</p>
<p>a professor of marketing at the Schulich School of Business at York University who has led courses in crisis management.</p>
<p>"The government model is 'You come to us.' But we've had 40 years of 'You come to me.' So we have a clash between authority and the market," he said.</p>
<p>"You've got to say: 'The risk is substantial for you and your family.' Not as in: 'You'll die.' But as in 'You'll get ill. We'll make it easy for you.' The message has to be: 'Here's how to get it done conveniently'," said Middleton, who cites Canadian Blood Services' strategy of bringing bloodmobiles to workplaces and shopping malls to make donating blood convenient. "There's a whole bunch of people who won't queue for three or four hours."</p>
<p>In the U.S., some schools are providing flu clinics. In New York, health commissioner Thomas Farley sent six per cent of the city's limited vaccine supply to large employers, including <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> and <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span>, because they usually immunize during regular flu season.</p>
<p>Like many employers, Middleton's university had considered holding a vaccination clinic. But the plan, which emerged late last summer, has since disappeared.</p>
<p>"I haven't been jabbed. I'm not on a priority group," he said. "I'm not going to wait in a queue to get jabbed."</p>
<p>Schools are an obvious place to vaccinate large groups of people. Ottawa school boards have already indicated a willingness to assist. But on Thursday, Ottawa's medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, dismissed it.</p>
<p>Although planners contemplated using schools to immunize, the idea was dropped because it would create inequitable access from one area to the next, said Dr. Nadine Sicard, an associate medical officer of health, on Friday.</p>
<p>"Here in Ottawa we have 350 schools. We have 150 immunizers a day," she said. "Based on experience with school programs, it's not the most efficient way to do it."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, workplaces are not authorized to immunize and there has been no indication from the province that it intends to extend that authority, said Sicard. She was expecting a shipment of 30,000 doses late Friday to be administered to patients on the priority list over the weekend and into next week.</p>
<p>Uncertainty of supply has proved to be another barrier for qualified employers who want to bring the vaccine to their employees, said Middleton. And it will affect the decisions of people who aren't on the priority list yet. It's late in the flu season and they will convince themselves that the wave of infection has since passed, said Middleton.</p>
<p>"The money's spent, we've got the vaccine. Let's get it out to the population."</p>

obstacles like long lines.

<div id="hd"><b>Weekend vaccination clinics open</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam, With files from Lee Greenberg   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>750 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ottawa's H1N1 vaccination clinics are expected to continue over the weekend with the delivery of another 30,000 doses of the pandemic flu shot.</p>
<p>With delays in manufacturing the vaccine and a dwindling supply nationwide, public-health officials had warned the city's vaccination clinics could run out of the shot by the end of the week.</p>
<p>The latest shipment, which was scheduled to arrive late Friday, is expected to allow the clinics to continue vaccinating priority groups until next week. The groups include people under 65 with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women, children between six months and five years of age, health-care workers and caregivers of babies and people with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>The new shipment is part of 170,000 doses Ontario received this week from the federal government. The province has also set aside a central stockpile of about 100,000 doses it will use to backfill dwindling supplies in cities such as Ottawa.</p>
<p>Dr. Nadine Sicard, the city's associate medical officer of health, said more vaccine shipments could arrive next week.</p>
<p>"The information that we have concerning the supply is that the federal government will have about 1.2 million doses for all of the country sometime early next week, and we're still waiting for details on how this will be divided among the provinces," said Sicard.</p>
<p>Until the city has enough supply, none of the vaccine will be distributed to doctors' offices, even though 120 family physicians have so far met the provincial criteria that allow them to give the pandemic flu shot to their patients, said Sicard.</p>
<p>This week, the virus claimed the life of another Ottawa resident, bringing the total number of H1N1-related deaths in the city to seven.</p>
<p>Sicard said the person was "middle-aged" and had an underlying health condition, but she did not provide any additional information about him or her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the number of lab-confirmed cases of H1N1 in Ottawa continues to rise, bringing the total to 265 since Sept. 1, the unofficial start of the pandemic's second wave.</p>
<p>Of the 94 new cases reported this week, 44 people are currently in hospital, with nine patients developing serious enough complications to be admitted into intensive-care units. As of Friday, six of them were on life-saving ventilators to help them breathe, Sicard said.</p>
<p>While the number of life-threatening H1N1 cases has so far not overwhelmed Eastern Ontario's 110 intensive-care beds, there have been hotspots.</p>
<p>According to Maureen Taylor-Greenly, a member of a citywide committee of hospital emergency planners, The Ottawa Hospital's General campus has had "minor periods" when it had more patients at its 28-bed ICU than it normally handles. In such cases, the hospital had the capacity to open up to four additional beds.</p>
<p>"When we are dealing with a minor surge in activity, as in the past two weeks, we have been able to increase staffing to allow us to open additional beds to meet the clinical demands," said Allison Neill, spokeswoman for The Ottawa Hospital.</p>
<p>Taylor-Greenly said the medical directors of the city's five ICUs meet daily to ensure patients who require ventilation get access to it.</p>
<p>"If we had to, we certainly would move patients from one ICU to another to ensure that we can meet the demand in the community," said Taylor-Greenly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, some 350 people with flu-like symptoms have sought medical help at Ottawa's six flu assessment centres since they opened on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Taylor-Greenly said the centres, aimed at taking some of the load off hospital emergency rooms, have led to a slight drop in ER visits.</p>
<p>Sicard urged people who are sick with coughs and fevers, at high risk of developing flu-related complications, and who don't have family doctors to head to the centres.</p>
<p>"The flu assessment centres have more capacity to see more patients than have been seen so far, and we encourage the public to use them," said Sicard.</p>

<p>Wristband information</p>
<p>Numbered wristbands for people waiting to be vaccinated at the City of Ottawa administration building at 100 Constellation Cres., are now being handed out at 9 a.m. daily, instead of at 1 p.m. The clinic will continue to be open between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. on weekdays and 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on weekends.</p>

Staff reporters   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1046 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>MET</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>At least seven Toronto hospitals have given preferential access to scarce H1N1 vaccines to their boards of governors.</p>
<p>Hospitals where board members jumped the queue include Mount Sinai, St. Michael's, Sunnybrook, Bridgepoint and the University Health Network's three hospitals.</p>
<p>Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King, stipulated Friday that hospital board members are not health-care workers and not entitled to the shot unless they suffer from a pre-existing medical condition.</p>
<p>In a letter to the Ontario Medical Association, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, and the College of Family Physicians obtained by the Star, King reminded them "of the importance of following this priority group list since the province's supply of pandemic H1N1 influenza vaccine is limited at this time."</p>
<p>The chief microbiologist at Mount Sinai, Dr. Don Low, apologized for the controversy. Board members there include Gerald Schwartz, head of <span class="companylink">Onex Corp</span>., and Lawrence Tanenbaum, chair of Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd.</p>
<p>It is not known which board members received the vaccinations.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry this has happened. At the time, it seemed like the right thing to do," Low said, noting that polls on Oct. 26, when the vaccinations took place, indicated most Ontarians didn't even want the shot.</p>
<p>Low is also medical director of Ontario's public health laboratories, part of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, which is overseeing the province's response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Anthony Dale, vice-president of the Ontario Hospital Association, said the hospitals had deemed the board members to be "health-care workers," one of six priority groups entitled to early shots.</p>
<p>"Board members may not be paid employees, but they serve in very important voluntary governance roles and help lead the hospitals and are in and out of hospitals across the province" daily, Dale said. "It would be easy to see how hospitals could interpret some board members as being eligible. It's an honest mistake."</p>
<p>Now that it's been clarified, he said, hospitals will act accordingly.</p>
<p>The issue of queue jumping has hit a nerve as Canada grapples with a vaccine shortage. Peel Region has been forced to cancel its immunization clinics from Sunday to Wednesday because of the shortage. While King announced that Ontario would get 770,000 more doses next week, the rationing to high priority groups continues.</p>
<p>Ontarians have complained of waiting up to seven hours at some mass vaccination clinics, though queues appear to be getting shorter as the shot is offered in more places.</p>
<p>Alberta's health board revealed Friday that a second person was fired for helping set up a private clinic for the Calgary Flames.</p>
<p>Toronto Maple Leafs and Raptors players have also received shots, and Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews doesn't buy that they are high priority.</p>
<p>"Well, I'm sure that all the pregnant players of the Raptors and the Maple Leafs have received their vaccination, as have all under age 5," she told reporters.</p>
<p>A private clinic in Toronto has been accused of giving preferential access to people in priority groups who first had to pay $2,300 to become patients and be assessed.</p>
<p>"It just isn't right that a 6-year-old has to wait and someone else with better connections can go ahead," Matthews said, adding that the province will investigate queue jumping once the pandemic is over.</p>
<p>A union representing hospital workers called for board members who jumped the queue to resign.</p>
<p>"Hospital board members who jumped the queue are guilty of a serious ethical lapse and grave error of judgment. Women and children are dying and front-line health workers are risking their lives - while these overpaid fat cats have the nerve to put themselves first. They should go," said Sharleen Stewart, head of Service Employees International Union, Local 1.</p>
<p>The union represents 46,000 health-care workers in Ontario, including nurses and staff in housekeeping, environmental services, maintenance and dietary services.</p>
<p>"What we are seeing is like first-class passengers pushing themselves to the front of the Titanic and leaving women and children to their fate," Stewart said.</p>
<p>The Hospital for Sick Children said it did not vaccinate its board members. But others defended doing so. John King, executive vice president at St. Michael's, said board members are vital to hospital operations, like any nurse, doctor, receptionist or janitor. (On that board sit people like former premier David Peterson and Julie Di Lorenzo, head of the Greater Toronto Home Builders Association.)</p>
<p>"I think that you need to understand this wasn't taken lightly," he said. "When we're talking about, what is the most important thing during a pandemic, that is to keep the hospitals functioning."</p>
<p>Dr. Vivek Goel, president of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, last week told the Star editorial board he had refused the shot because of the bad "optics."</p>
<p>He said agency members debated whether they were health-care workers or administrators and decided the latter.</p>
<p>At Queen's Park, NDP Leader Andrea Horwath called for disciplinary action against doctors who allowed people to jump the line. "We want to see a full accounting of every single vaccination that's gone out the door inappropriately."</p>

<p>How one Ontario community avoided</p>
<p>chaos at H1N1 clinics, Opinion, Nov. 3</p>
<p>Michael Rachlis's opinion piece misleads your readers about the involvement of physicians in the administration of the H1N1 vaccine. Ontario's doctors have been ready to give the vaccine all along. However, many did not receive it until this week and others are still waiting. Those who have it have been diligent in getting the vaccine to their patients in the priority groups.</p>
<p>Ontario's doctors are national leaders in primary care reform with more than 7,500 doctors providing service to more than 8.5 million patients in collaborative care models. We know that when physicians, nurses, pharmacists and other health-care professionals work together under one roof, we can provide an enhanced level of care to patients.</p>

<p>Elite at front of line for flu shots,</p>
<p>Column, Nov. 4</p>
<p>Thomas Walkom has exposed a small part of the upper tier that is eroding in our public health system.</p>
<p>When the Ontario government allocated 3,000 doses of the scarce H1N1 flu vaccine to high-paying clientele of Medcan, those affluent clients were not alone. Highly paid athletes who work for the Toronto Raptors and the Maple Leafs have also jumped the queue and received their H1N1 flu shots. All of this is absolutely contrary to the concept of a public health system that is freely accessible to all of us when we need it. It is an injustice.</p>
<p>Our governments, national and provincial, are proving to be in need of an education on the meaning of the word "public," as in, "we are all in this together."</p>
<p>The evidence seems to indicate that we have two governments that are instituting a two-tier, pay your way to the front of the line health-care system. Even worse, they are not disclosing this information.</p>
<p>We need more journalists like Walkom to dig into the actions of the political elites.</p>

<p>Calgary -- A second Alberta health-care worker has been fired for allowing 150 people connected with the Calgary Flames hockey team to jump the queue and receive H1N1 vaccinations at a special clinic last week.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services, the board that oversees health care in the province, made the announcement yesterday, two days after it dismissed “the most senior staff member involved” in the Flames flu controversy.</p>
<p>“There is no process for authorization of the use of the H1N1 vaccine for this purpose, as it contradicts existing protocols and processes,” the board said in a statement.</p>
<p>No other disciplinary action will be taken, the board said, adding that an advisory has been sent to everyone involved in the vaccination campaign to ensure “no exceptions will be made.”</p>
<p>David Climenhaga, a spokesman for the Alberta Union of Provincial Employees, called the fired employees “scapegoats” and an “overreaction” for “government blunders” in connection with the vaccine rollout. He doesn't know whether either employee is a member of his union, but said that AUPE would be quick to file grievances if that is the case.</p>

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- With the swine flu taking its toll on an anxious nation's psyche, children are proving to be an at-risk group in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Parents and health professionals hear it from children confronting the new realities of absent classmates, cancelled hockey games and daily doses of H1N1 warnings. Ontario psychologist Marian Boer was talking to an eight-year-old recently who was upset about a classmate stricken with the flu.</p>
<p>“All the kids think he's going to die,” the third-grader told her.</p>
<p>The spread of H1N1 has touched communities across Canada and exposed a generation of kids to a seemingly amorphous new threat. In the 1950s, schoolchildren had to do duck-and-cover drills in case of a nuclear weapons attack. Now, parents and public officials teach kids to shield themselves from danger with orders to cough-and-cover – or at least, to sneeze into their elbows.</p>
<p>The new health regime of dos and don'ts can be confusing. One 13-year-old in Montreal was yelled at by his teacher this week because he coughed in class and said he didn't feel well. “Why didn't you stay home?” she demanded.</p>
<p>The Canadian Psychological Association warns that the threat of illness can be especially upsetting to children and teenagers. And endless reports of vaccine queues, death tallies and worried parents have become hard to escape.</p>
<p>“If kids are exposed to it all the time, it's going to make them more anxious,” said Dr. Boer, chief psychologist for the York Region District School Board. “Sometimes you've got to tune it out.”</p>
<p>Still, tuning out becomes tough when the flu reaches into kids' lives. The Midget CC hockey league in Quebec's Eastern Townships instituted strict rules to fight the flu, ordering individual water bottles for the 15-to-17-year-old players, and eliminating post-game handshakes.</p>
<p>But when one player missed 12 days of practices and games due to the flu, his teammates were shaken up.</p>
<p>“They're tough guys. But some of them are afraid of it,” coach Claude Paré said. “Everyone's talking about the flu and it's starting to get them really nervous. The kids are under stress and asking a lot of questions … as coaches, we're trying to control any panic.”</p>
<p>When the sick player returned, he told teammates he'd been quarantined in his room at home, his parents allowed to enter only with face masks and gloves. “Everyone was listening,” the coach said.</p>
<p>In the Ontario community of Goderich, Monique Sykes's nine-year-old son became ill recently, rising from his sleep vomiting and with a fever of over 101 Fahrenheit. A severe asthma sufferer, he was at high risk of severe illness if he caught the flu. “With his asthma, the flu represented a huge danger for us,” Ms. Sykes said. “It was terrifying. We were extremely concerned.”</p>
<p>Ms. Sykes and her husband took turns through the night keeping vigil over their son, and whisked him to hospital in the morning; although he'd received a flu shot, it had yet to take effect. He caught the flu and had to be prescribed Tamiflu and antibiotics.</p>
<p>The boy, an avid hockey and soccer player, recovered. But the flu's swift and merciless grip took an emotional toll on the family. The boy's 10-year-old brother was upset to see his younger brother ill. He, too, asked the mortality question.</p>
<p>“Is he going to die?” he asked his parents, his mother recalled.</p>
<p>Psychologists say most kids will cope fine with the flu outbreak, but others may be more affected by sick schoolmates and the recent flu-related deaths of two Ontario children. In extreme cases, some kids may even avoid going to school altogether.</p>
<p>The best solution, psychologists say, is cues from Mom and Dad.</p>
<p>“I would caution parents to be calm. If they are overanxious, children will pick up on that and they too will become overanxious,” said Douglas Agar, president of the British Columbia Association of School Psychologists.</p>
<p>“Kids may not understand all the working of the flu virus,” he said, “but they do understand that Mummy is a little nervous.”</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>HELPING KIDS COPE</p>
<p>The Canadian Psychological Association urges parents to discuss the H1N1 flu and give their kids the chance to talk about their concerns.</p>
<p>Parents of children who are frightened by reports of flu-related deaths should also stress that such cases are rare, and that health officials are working hard to contain the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>Health workers suggest parents review hygiene practices with their kids. They should also be honest and factual about the flu. In the absence of facts, children may imagine situations far worse than they really are.</p>
<p>Parents should also explain that most people who get sick will get better.</p>

<p>Canada's premiers will press the federal government to give them more timely information on just how much H1N1 vaccine is available for the provinces, so they can better plan the rollout of their inoculation plans.</p>
<p>Officials across Canada have expressed frustration that Ottawa has been slow to inform them about how much vaccine provinces and territories will get each week. Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Arlene King, was caught off guard this week when reporters asked her how much of the 1.8 million doses Ontario is getting next week.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall held a conference call with his provincial colleagues yesterday, and they discussed approaching Ottawa about making sure they have as much information as possible. “The provinces will be able to better plan if we have at least some tracking estimates on the vaccine,” Mr. Wall told reporters.</p>

<p>When it comes to swine flu shots, Canadians understand who should get them first. Hockey players! Hockey players must not be made to stand in line with the halt, the lame, the pregnant and the harried mothers with their tots in tow. Athletes serve the national interest. And if you doubt they are a high-risk group, just ask them.</p>
<p>“We go from city to city and rink to rink,” Maple Leafs centre John Mitchell told the Toronto Star. “There's people that might be an avid fan who doesn't want to miss a game even though he's feeling a little sick. … We have every bit of a chance of catching it as everybody else, maybe a little bit more.”</p>
<p>No one wants the Maple Leafs to be stricken with swine flu. It might ruin their whole season. Thankfully, sports fans everywhere can rest assured that their favourite players need not waste a moment waiting for any kind of medical attention – MRIs, CAT scans, knee surgery or their annual checkups. That's because they don't use the public system.</p>
<p>Board members at Mount Sinai, a leading Toronto hospital, were also said to have received flu shots last month, so they will be able to carry on their ceaseless toil on behalf of universal health care. People who pay stiff fees to private clinics, as well as company executives enrolled in these clinics as a perk, don't have to line up, either.</p>
<p>Other nations have other priority groups. In the U.S., news came that <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> was immunizing investment bankers who have reaped billions in government bailouts. Swamped by hundreds of furious calls from the public, health officials were quick to reassure them that even <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> is bound by the honour system – which means that pregnant investment bankers should be first in line. “Just because it's <span class="companylink">Goldman Sachs</span> doesn't mean it's wrong,” said one health official.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, public health officials were in despair because people thought that swine flu was a yawn. Now they're in despair because people are in a panic. “You'd think that not getting the vaccine is akin to being deprived of a lifeboat off the Titanic,” one health expert told me.</p>
<p>But, really, who can blame us? We've been deluged with 24/7 coverage, heart-wrenching stories about healthy children who died and screaming headlines telling us not to panic. First the message was: “This is really, really serious, and everyone should get the shot as soon as possible or your neighbour's kid might die.” Now the message is: “This is really serious, but not that serious, really, and everyone has got to keep it in perspective and wait their turn.”</p>
<p>First they told us they would treat all comers, so people lined up around the block for hours. Then they told us to go home and wait, because there wasn't enough vaccine.</p>
<p>Meantime, swine flu phobia has swept the nation far faster than the flu itself. Dozens of schools have shut because of swine flu fear. In St. George, N.B., five schools closed when absenteeism soared, although it was far from clear how many people were actually sick, and even less clear how many of those had swine flu.</p>
<p>One public health expert reminded us that, if you're healthy, you're about 20 times more likely to die this year from a car crash than from swine flu. But nobody paid the least bit of attention.</p>
<p>The swine flu story is a microcosm of our nation. It features two-tier health care (which everyone keeps pretending to be shocked about), and politicians insisting that no one should get special treatment, even though they always have. It has politicians at all levels yelling at each other to score points. It also features an excess of bureaucracy and too many layers of government. Every province has a different flu-shot plan, and every city and town does, too, and none of them know when the next batch of vaccine will arrive.</p>
<p>We also seem to have a shortage of people who can actually give shots and manage lineups. With so many obstacles standing between your kid and her flu shot, it's a wonder she'll be getting it at all.</p>
<p>My own city, Toronto, is a miserable case in point. We are decently supplied with family doctors, who routinely dole out flu shots. But swine flu shots are all tied up in red tape. So their patients spend hours in lineups at public clinics, instead.</p>
<p>“It makes no sense to suddenly foist an onerous, bureaucratic protocol upon family doctors,” said one physician. Nor will flu clinics be held in schools, a logical place to have them. Instead, children will be bussed to immunization centres, providing their parents sign the consent form, although one bureaucrat is now warning that parents will have to accompany their children.</p>
<p>By the time the bureaucrats work out all the details, flu season will be over. You can be sure the finger-pointing will last a good deal longer. But at least there's one big consolation: No matter how we've screwed it up, we haven't screwed it up as much as the Americans.</p>

</div><div>JANE TABER   </div>
<div>697 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>SENIOR POLITICAL WRITER</p>
<p>jtaber@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Michael Ignatieff needs to get a grip – on his caucus, on his party and on his staff. Too many of his Liberals are going rogue.</p>
<p>Eight of his MPs voted with the Tories this week to kill the long-gun registry. The Chrétien Liberals created the registry, spilling political blood to frame it into law. Privately, in the closed-door caucus meeting on Wednesday, Mr. Ignatieff urged his MPs to stand together and vote against the government. His pleas fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>This week, too, Liberal president Alf Apps sent a note to colleagues and party supporters comparing the H1N1 vaccine crisis to the Bush government's handling of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. More than a few Liberals were upset with the Apps hyperbole.</p>
<p>Then, Mr. Ignatieff's hand-picked national party director, Rocco Rossi, was on Twitter, joking about swine flu and party patronage, saying “pork before swine.” A veteran Tory strategist called the Rossi joke “offensive.”</p>
<p>It doesn't end there: Ignatieff senior staffer Mark Sakamoto appeared on national television as an “ordinary citizen” complaining about the supply of the H1N1 vaccine. His cover was blown; the incident was embarrassing.</p>
<p>Mr. Sakamoto denied he was a plant. As parents of a newborn, he and his wife are on the priority list for the vaccine, and were waiting in line at a clinic when the interviewer approached. However, some believe the Ignatieff adviser should have known better.</p>
<p>Clearly, this behaviour is unnerving the Grits, with one Liberal describing the unwinding of the Ignatieff Liberals as being of “biblical proportions.”</p>
<p>Perhaps a slight exaggeration. But it is still instructive as it is happening when no one is in charge.</p>
<p>Mr. Ignatieff's new chief of staff is Peter Donolo. His ETA on the Hill is Nov. 17. Mr. Donolo's predecessor, Ian Davey, a close friend and adviser to Mr. Ignatieff, is on a beach in Florida with his girlfriend, Jill Fairbrother, the very capable director of communications to Mr. Ignatieff.</p>
<p>The two are mulling over their future. It is not clear whether they will return, and if they do, in what capacity.</p>
<p>Amid all this uncertainty is an undercurrent of restiveness in the caucus about Mr. Davey's treatment. His imminent departure was leaked to the media before he even had a chance to speak to Mr. Ignatieff, and while Ms. Fairbrother was still denying it. Where is the leader's loyalty, some MPs wonder.</p>
<p>This rogue behaviour, meanwhile, is providing great fodder for the government, which is accusing the Ignatieff Liberals of being so base as to exploit the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>“It is very sad and unfortunate that the Ignatieff Liberals are desperately attempting to politicize the H1N1 preparedness efforts of the federal and provincial governments,” the PMO said in its “Alert” response to the Sakamoto television appearance. And in Question Period this week, Tory cabinet ministers repeated that same “politicization” refrain.</p>
<p>Have the Liberals lost their way?</p>
<p>EKOS national pollster Frank Graves says not yet. But they need to walk a fine line. Handled properly, the flu issue gives the Liberals an opportunity to show their stuff by keeping the government's feet to the fire. He cautions them not to “wheel out the heavy artillery” until they are sure the government has grossly mishandled the situation. So far that does not appear to be the case.</p>
<p>“To do that at this stage you may end up looking basically disingenuous,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Graves has some sympathy for the Grits. “They are having a bad time in the polls, and they see a lob ball coming in and they just take a wild swing at it. … You kind of feel a little sorry for them.”</p>
<p>He believes that with Mr. Donolo's experience, Mr. Ignatieff can rein in the Liberal outliers:</p>
<p>“Certainly a guy like Peter will be able to sort through what's a real opportunity and a real exposed flank versus what's just a story of the day.”</p>
<p>We'll see in a couple of weeks.</p>

<p>Two years pass quickly in politics and Manitoba's Progressive Conservatives don't want to be caught napping.</p>
<p>That's why their annual general meeting this weekend has taken on the atmosphere of a campaign kickoff rather than just a rehash of internal party business.</p>
<p>With the popular former NDP premier Gary Doer now nestled in Washington, D.C., as Canada's ambassador, the Tories see a chance to pull themselves out of the political wilderness.</p>
<p>"This is an important meeting," Progressive Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen said Friday. "It's been 14 years since we last won an election. We've not had a lot to celebrate.</p>
<p>"Now we have an opportunity to make party members believe in themselves again."</p>
<p>That process actually started the day former finance minister Greg Selinger was elected premier. From the get-go the Tories under McFadyen have portrayed Selinger as a weak and sometimes invisible leader, particularly with the recent confusion over who was entitled H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>The NDP, meanwhile, have taken almost every opportunity to get Selinger out in front of the TV cameras to raise his profile as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>McFadyen said this means that the campaign to form the next government, despite election day being almost two years away, is well underway.</p>
<p>"What I hope is party members come away from this weekend feeling they have to go out and work hard for the next election," he said. "Things don't happen suddenly. We're going to have to work away at it one vote at a time."</p>
<p>McFadyen's keynote address is today at 11:30 a.m. at the Radisson Hotel.</p>
<p>Jonathan Scarth, CEO of the Manitoba PCs, said the focus of this AGM is election preparedness.</p>
<p>The 300 delegates will discuss 87 resolutions to lay the foundation of their election platform. The last AGM saw the party debate 14 resolutions.</p>
<p>Many resolutions echo the party's position on issues like Bipole III -- the new hydro transmission line should go down the east side of Lake Winnipeg, not the west side of the province -- and should be approved quickly.</p>
<p>Scarth said party members will also adopt changes that will allow the Tories to get a head start on election readiness and nominating candidates.</p>
<p>The party's finances are healthy.</p>
<p>"We're raising more than we did last year," said Scarth. "We're also spending more on election preparedness."</p>
<p>bruce.owen@freepress.mb.cA</p>
<p>Reviewing resolutions</p>
<p>Manitoba's Progressive Conservatives start their annual general meeting today. The agenda includes setting some policy priorities as the Oct. 4, 2011 provincial elections inches closer. Here's a look at some of the 87 resolutions up for discussion:</p>
<p>Exempting first-time homebuyers from the land transfer tax: The Tories say the exemption would free up some cash for many young homebuyers to get their house sooner (the land transfer tax is calculated based on the fair market value of realty on the date of registration).</p>
<p>Tax credits for healthy adult activity: The PCs say if they form the next government they'd provide tax credit to adults for fitness classes and gym classes to encourage physical fitness.</p>
<p>Accurate report cards: The Progressive Conservatives would bring back report cards with percentage grades for all grade 5-12 students. Reports would be standard across all divisions and sent home three times a year.</p>
<p>Therapeutic drug jail: Many repeat criminal are drug abusers. The Tories would build a new jail to treat drug users so once released they don't fall back into crime to get their next fix.</p>
<p>Police helicopter: The PC Party of Manitoba, if it forms the next government, would provide the necessary resources to get a police helicopter for Winnipeg police.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Unnecessary visits discouraged - Doctors, clinics bracing for influx of influenza patients</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt   </div>
<div>715 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Family doctors are extending prescriptions and encouraging Manitobans who aren't sick to stay away from clinic waiting rooms that could soon fill up with flu patients in need of antivirals.</p>
<p>Across the country, family doctors are bracing to see three times as many patients sick with influenza than they normally would in a typical year.</p>
<p>Dr. Fran Berard, president of the Manitoba College of Family Physicians, said that's why physicians across the province are telling their patients not to come in unless they really need to. She said many family doctors are writing extra doses of prescriptions over the phone or have asked patients to phone their pharmacy to extend prescriptions, as long as they aren't narcotics.</p>
<p>Many clinics encourage people with flu symptoms to put on a mask, Berard said, and keep a one- to two-metre distance from others.</p>
<p>"If you're not well, fine, come in. But if you're well, we're trying to avoid unnecessary visits," Berard said.</p>
<p>Health officials expect the number of people sick with H1N1 to increase in the coming weeks as the second wave of influenza enters its peak. People who are at high risk of severe illness with any ordinary symptoms of influenza -- including fever, cough, muscle aches, fatigue, and nausea -- should see a family doctor within 24 to 48 hours to receive antivirals that can prevent symptoms from worsening.</p>
<p>Tamiflu and other antivirals are only available with a doctor's prescription, so high-risk Manitobans will need to visit their family doctor or a walk-in clinic for the medication.</p>
<p>"You should go early to get assessed because you may need Tamiflu or another antiviral to prevent a more serious illness," said Dr. Sande Harlos, the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Harlos said the second wave of H1N1 hasn't reached its peak yet, and there are contingency plans should there be an increased demand for antivirals. She said clinics will extend hours and family doctors will take on extra patients with flu symptoms in the event there is a flood of patients at walk-ins.</p>
<p>If the situation worsens, primary health centres will set up areas designated for patients with flu symptoms to see a doctor and get the antivirals.</p>
<p>No one knows for certain when the number of H1N1 cases could reach its peak, which is why health officials urge people at high risk of severe illness to get the vaccine as soon as possible.</p>
<p>On Thursday, provincial officials confirmed the first suspected flu death this season is under review, and that the number of cases of severe respiratory illnesses in intensive care units is on the rise. Since Oct. 8, 20 people have been hospitalized for severe respiratory illness, including one lab-confirmed case of severe H1N1.</p>
<p>Health officials expect most, if not all, of the severe cases will turn out to be H1N1. Officials are still trying to determine how many severely ill patients received the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>It can take between a week and two weeks for body to build up immunity to the flu, but Harlos said it's hard to say whether the peak will hit before people are able to build up an immunity to H1N1. However, she said the body starts to build antibodies to ward off influenza after a couple of days, so it's never too late to get the vaccine.</p>

<p>Clinics reopen Nov. 12</p>
<p>Twelve city vaccination clinics are closed until Thursday, Nov. 12. The province expects another shipment of vaccine doses Wednesday, and clinics will reopen the next morning to vaccinate those on the priority list against H1N1.</p>
<p>On Friday, 4,763 people received the H1N1 vaccination at Winnipeg Regional Health Authority clinics, raising the cumulative total to 99,136 since the start of the campaign.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Winnipeggers are asked to avoid unnecessary visits to emergency rooms.</p>
<p>On Friday, Children's Hospital ER saw a large number of children present with flu-like illnesses -- more than half of all patients. Everyone who goes into Children's emergency will be offered a mask to protect themselves or prevent them from spreading an infection to others.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Peter Mansbridge: From anchor to buoy</b>
</div><div>WARREN CLEMENTS   </div>

<p>wclements@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>I shudder at the thought that this may all have been my fault. On July 25, in a column reflecting on the death of newscaster Walter Cronkite and the origin of the word anchorman, later shortened to anchor, I wrote the following: “In a way, it makes sense that an iron object designed to moor a ship to the bottom of the sea should be applied to the linchpin of a team … [But an] anchor is a dead weight. It keeps the team from moving. It is submerged, out of sight. Say what you will, but that sounds like an odd analogy for a highly visible, elevating presence whose job it is to keep things moving.”</p>
<p>Well, as viewers of CBC's The National will know, the show has yanked newscaster Peter Mansbridge from his chair and forced him to stand and wander the studio like the Flying Dutchman. I have no doubt that the change has been in the works for a long time, but, on the off-chance this column played a part in casting the anchor adrift, I feel honour-bound to find a new word to describe Mansbridge's current status.</p>
<p>Has he gone from anchor to buoy, free to bob on the waves even though tied to the studio? (Hey, news-buoy, what's the latest?) If he is moving about without any restraints, perhaps he should be called driftwood. Or, just as 7-Up sold itself as the Uncola, the newly ambulatory anchor might be the un-chor. Further suggestions are welcome at wclements@globeandmail.com.</p>
<p>Shooting by another name</p>
<p>While watching the TV drama Flashpoint, I was struck by a coincidence. Enrico Colantoni, whose résumé includes the role of photographer on the old fashion-magazine sitcom Just Shoot Me!, plays a senior member of the elite police unit that tackles crises in Flashpoint. In other words, he used a flash camera in Just Shoot Me! and has to shoot people in Flashpoint.</p>
<p>Banish negativity</p>
<p>A medical service advertised itself on AM radio in Toronto last month. The commercial said, “When it comes to your health, positive change is always a good thing.” I look forward to hearing of those areas of life in which positive change is not a good thing.</p>
<p>First came the roads</p>
<p>A recent column considered the words “profession” and “prostitution,” often called the world's oldest profession. Reader Derek Graham, a professional surveyor and land-use planner, couldn't resist a footnote “just to amend your thesis of what is the oldest profession.” That honour, he writes, goes to the ancient Roman agrimensores (Latin for land surveyors) or Egyptian harpedonaptae (Greek for “rope stretchers,” the folks who used ropes to determine the outline of the bases for the pyramids). “After all, someone had to lay out the course for the engineer to design the road for the streetwalkers!”</p>
<p>The Heene Flew!</p>
<p>After this column reflected on suggestions that H1N1, the other name for swine flu, be pronounced as if it were spelled “hini,” readers responded with additional considerations. Chris Kelk and Bill Kummer both note that if the word were pronounced “hee-nee,” it would have the same sound as the surname of Richard Heene, the Colorado father behind the “balloon boy” stunt. Kummer writes: “A headline screams: The Heene Flew!” It's a nice coincidence that the name of the son who was supposedly (but not in fact) airborne is Falcon.</p>
<p>Edith Leslie, who wrote the original note about “hini,” observes that if the word is pronounced “hinie” with a long “i,” it does more than rhyme with heinie, the slang word for buttocks. It also conjures up Freund Hein (Friend Hein), the cozy name for Death coined more than 200 years ago by German writer Matthias Claudius. “That is why I would like to pronounce it heenee,” Leslie says.</p>

<p>The world knows Alex Chilton, if it knows him at all, as the gritty, soul-inflected lead voice of the 1967 hit The Letter. Among rock cognoscenti, however, Alex Chilton is best known as the nominal co-leader for Big Star.</p>
<p>Big Star was anything but, making only three LPs, all in the early 1970s, all of which sold next to nothing. Since then, however, Big Star's influence has infiltrated dozens of acts, including the New Pornographers, R.E.M., The Pursuit of Happiness, Matthew Sweet and The Replacements. As Martin Aston puts it here, “Big Star were the Dixie Beatles, a gang of displaced Anglophiles [from Tennessee] whose albums brought a combined air of menace, ennui and pop exhilaration to ‘70s rock.”</p>
<p>Chilton occasionally reforms Big Star for live gigs using two pick-up musicians and original drummer Jody Stephens (who complains: “We've played the same set for the last 15 years”).</p>

<p>Andy Warhol's influence rests both on the objects he ostensibly produced and questions about originality and rarity in art raised by those objects.</p>
<p>Warhol's legacy has become increasingly problematic in the years since his 1987 death, especially with the controversial rise of the New York-based Andy Warhol Art Authentication Board.</p>
<p>ARTNews editor Eileen Kinsella explores one of the more intriguing “mysteries” of this legacy, the discovery, in 2007, that in 1990 the distinguished curator Pontus Hulten supervised the fabrication of 105 Brillo boxes, then passed these off as 1968 Warhol “originals” from a Warhol retrospective he'd mounted in the late ‘60s in Stockholm.</p>
<p>Amusingly, five years ago, the authentication board deemed 94 of the 105 Hulten boxes as 1968 “originals.” Now it's doing more research and plans to report “in the near future.”</p>

<p>November ‘09</p>
<p>The difficulties associated with the swine flu vaccination program have led many, predictably, to complain that there's something rotten with the state of Canada's public health system. Charles Wright agrees something's wrong, but argues here that Canada is being victimized by too much health care, what he calls “the relentless, inappropriate medicalization of society.”</p>
<p>To date, the public health debate has focused on the supply side of the funding equation – how to provide “more doctors, more nurses, more hospital beds” without crippling the economy. The more serious problem, Wright writes, is the intrusion or overuse of a plethora of procedures (cesarean sections, mammograms, PSA screening, prescription drug cocktails, ) whose benefits, as research increasingly demonstrates, are either questionable or non-existent and, in some cases, harmful.</p>

</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>SEASONALITY</p>
<p>Why do people get the flu in fall and winter and not at other times of the year?</p>
<p>For decades, medical researchers have viewed the distinct, seasonal pattern of the flu as one of the biggest mysteries presented by the disease. Seemingly like clockwork, Canadians begin to come down with the aches and fevers of the flu every fall. Cases then peak in the winter, after which the illness vanishes from sight for another half-year or so over the spring and summer, disappearing as inexplicably as it arrived.</p>
<p>And Canadians aren't alone in having a flu season. The same pattern is observed in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere in temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, as well as in the Southern Hemisphere, during its fall and winter, corresponding to the months of May through September. Even the tropics have a flu season, during their rainy periods.</p>
<p>Some scientists are betting that the fast horse in the race to explain the seasonality of the flu is the annual fluctuation in people's vitamin D levels. Levels of vitamin D plunge in Canadians</p>
<p>every fall and winter – corresponding neatly to the flu season – because sunlight isn't strong enough to make the nutrient the natural way, in naked skin exposed to strong ultraviolet light.</p>
<p>Recent research has found that vitamin D is needed for robust production of anti-microbial peptides, a key virus-fighting component of our immune system. According to the vitamin D theory, shortages of the nutrient are impairing our immune systems every fall and winter, making us unable to shake off flu viruses.</p>
<p>The originator of the theory is John Cannell, a U.S. psychiatrist who works at a state hospital for the criminally insane in California. Three years ago, he published an account of how an influenza epidemic swept through his hospital in 2005, but spared the ward where his patients had been receiving high doses of vitamin D. “It was just remarkable. My patients just didn't get sick,” Dr. Cannell says.</p>
<p>After details of his observations were released, a second group in the U.S., this one dosing black women with vitamin D, reported reductions of up to 90 per cent in the incidence of flu and the cold among those receiving the nutrient, adding to the credence of the idea.</p>
<p>Not everyone is reaching just yet for vitamin D pills to beat the flu. “I simply don't buy the vitamin D study,” says Peter Palese, chairman of the department of microbiology at New York's Mount Sinai School of Medicine, who has an alternative explanation for the flu that has experimental weight behind it.</p>
<p>He published a paper two years ago outlining an experiment he conducted showing that such simple factors as temperature and humidity were able to spur on flu viruses. Perhaps not surprisingly, given when the season flu hits, he found flu bugs just loved simulated wintertime conditions.</p>
<p>Dr. Palese's experiment tracked how easily guinea pigs were infected by airborne influenza viruses when temperature and humidity conditions were altered. The virus spread best when temperatures were on the cool side and the air was extremely dry. Temperatures of 5 C prompted the best spread, while at 20 C they didn't spread easily and at a summer-like 30 C there was no transmission at all. The viruses also favoured relative humidity of 20 to 35 per cent, extremely dry levels often reached in cold Arctic air masses.</p>
<p>One interpretation of these results is that cold temperatures help the virus by acting like a refrigerator, keeping them stable and longer-lasting. Low humidity helps flu bugs stay airborne longer, increasing the odds that someone will breathe them in and become infected.</p>
<p>Martin Mittelstaedt</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>2</p>
<p>GEOGRAPHY</p>
<p>How do viruses spread?</p>
<p>Asia is typically considered “ground zero” for influenza viruses because many strains seem to originate from that continent before spreading around the world. But despite vast amounts of knowledge about how flu is transmitted from person to person, the migration pattern of influenza around the world is still subject to debate. A study published in the journal Science last year found that new flu strains pop up in East and Southeast Asia before travelling to Europe, Australia and North America around the same time before hitting South America, where the strain dies away as the flu season ends.</p>
<p>But detailed flu surveillance is a relatively new science. While it's possible for researchers to use isolated flu viruses to study past patterns, a detailed history of historical pandemics and flu outbreaks remains unclear. Earl Brown, a virologist at the University of Ottawa, says there is always flu activity occurring in Asia, partly because extreme population density and close proximity between humans and animals allows new flu strains to develop. Strains that are passed easily from person to person can spread around the world, becoming the year's seasonal flu strain.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus doesn't follow the conventions, however. The strain seems to have originated in Mexico – although it's possible it came from elsewhere and was recognized only once it reached that country. It's considered “novel” because unlike typical flu viruses, which result from small variations to past seasonal strains, H1N1 is a completely different strain that people have little or no immunity against. The World Health Organization says it is unclear where the H1N1 virus originated, and some experts are calling for better flu surveillance to monitor new strains that appear outside Asia.</p>
<p>Reports from the Public Health Agency of Canada suggest that some seasonal flu viruses tend to spread through countries in a west-to-east direction. However, as more clues about the trail of influenza viruses emerge, it seems there are no hard and fast rules about their geographical spread. One of the biggest factors that can affect transmission of the flu is travel, Dr. Brown says. Infected people who travel from one country to another can easily spread the virus without following a typical geographical pattern.</p>
<p>Carly Weeks</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>LIFE CYCLE</p>
<p>What happens after flu season ends?</p>
<p>The seasonal flu viruses that typically affect Canadians are variations of three main viruses: two types of influenza A and one of influenza B. Many variations on these strains occur each year, virologist Earl Brown says. Research suggests these variations originate in Asia, mainly because of contact between humans and animals, although others suggest new viruses can develop elsewhere.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown says the strongest or “best” strain – that is, one that can be transmitted easily from person to person – often becomes the dominant strain, which becomes the year's seasonal flu that spreads around the world. It's possible for more than one strain to be in circulation in various parts of the world during flu season. Flu vaccines typically contain agents to fight a combination of a few flu viruses, based on what experts believe could be the dominant strains in a given year.</p>
<p>When a flu season ends, viruses seem to disappear. But in reality, most viruses cease to be spread once the flu season is over because people have developed immunity, through either inoculation or developing the illness, as well as a host of environmental and seasonal factors. That doesn't mean the viruses go away, however. Rather, they develop variations and changes over a period of time, until one strain dominates and becomes the next seasonal flu virus.</p>
<p>Although the new H1N1 virus can be unpredictable, researchers believe that once this second wave is over, transmission of the virus between people will slow down. Once it can no longer</p>
<p>infect people, the virus will probably change into a less virulent form that will become next year's seasonal flu. A similar trend occurred in the years after the 1918 pandemic. While it's possible for the virus to mount a third wave or become much more virulent next year, Kumanan Wilson, public-health policy chair at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, says current research supports the theory that H1N1 will transform into a regular seasonal flu that most people will have partial or full immunity against.</p>
<p>Carly Weeks</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>How flu viruses mix</p>
<p>Novel flu viruses can develop through a process called "antigenic shift," when two or more strains of a virus, or different viruses, mix to create a new strain. Scientists have mapped out three general ways antigenic shift can occur. The H N virus followed some of these conventions, but it evolved through an even more complicated process scientists are now trying to understand.</p>
<p>Bird influenza A strain</p>
<p>(1) (A)</p>
<p>A duck or other aquatic bird passes a bird strain of influenza A to an intermediate host such as a chicken or pig.</p>
<p>Human influenza A strain</p>
<p>(1) (B)</p>
<p>A person passes a human strain of influenza A to the same chicken or pig. (Note that reassortment can occur in a person who is infected with two flu strains.)</p>
<p>(1) (C)</p>
<p>When the viruses infect the same cell, the genes from the bird strain mix with the genes from the human strain to yield a new strain.</p>
<p>(1) (D)</p>
<p>The new strain can spread from the intermediate host to humans.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Without undergoing a genetic change, a bird strain of influenza A can jump directly from a duck or other aquatic bird to humans.</p>
<p>The new strain may further evolve to spread from person to person. If so, a flu pandemic could arise.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Without undergoing genetic change, a bird strain of influenza A can jump directly from a duck or other aquatic bird to an intermediate animal host and then to humans.</p>
<p>HUMAN FLU MIGRATION</p>
<p>Seasonal influenza strains constantly evolve in overlapping epidemics in Asia and sweep the rest of the world each year, dying out in South America. This suggests that by focusing on East and Southeast Asia, researchers may be able to extend their forecast of the flu strains most likely to cause epidemics.</p>

<p>tsouthey@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>I wish I could sustain enough faith in humanity to believe in the conspiracy theories that I've heard recently regarding the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>If government and pharmaceutical companies are capable of working together, with medical professionals, all committed to doing pure evil, this would at least demonstrate that mankind is capable of completing mammoth, future-altering projects.</p>
<p>We're just choosing not to.</p>
<p>I'd sleep better knowing that there was a race of Bond villains among us. The task of converting all of that collective inventiveness and industriousness from diabolical evil into good would be simple, compared with the work of organizing actual messy people and mismanaged institutions into anything capable of achieving something momentous. At least the infrastructure would be there.</p>
<p>If H1N1 is a pharmaceutical-company scam, as I've been repeatedly told, or if 9/11 was an inside job, or if all of the peer-reviewed articles proving the existence of climate change were manufactured for eventual political gain, at least the human race would have demonstrated great foresight and ambition.</p>
<p>After all, it would arguably have been more difficult and imaginative to fake a moon landing than it was to actually land on the plain, old moon.</p>
<p>And, most impressively, in an era in which apparently many people can't make a casserole without “tweeting” that fact, these evil endeavours would've required discretion: No one ever talks.</p>
<p>As if.</p>
<p>It'd be reassuring to think 9/11 was an inside job. But if the people who pulled that off were, as the theory runs, the same people who subsequently invaded Iraq, Baghdad would be running like Geneva right now. At least those towers stayed down.</p>
<p>Oh, I know, they want it to be a mess so they can stay in Iraq; that's Part 2 of the theory. Again, it'd be nice to think that “they” ever felt that they needed an excuse.</p>
<p>It's as if humanity had come a full 360 degrees. We've moved from the credulousness that thrives on ignorance (excusable when we were actually ignorant), to a healthy skepticism, to just skepticism, to cynicism. And this led increasing numbers of people right back to credulousness again.</p>
<p>The impulse to question (sit in on any undergraduate class if you don't believe me) is currently perhaps validated above the impulse to learn, or at least to learn first. And into that educational void, far more entertaining and easily communicated conspiracy theories have flooded.</p>
<p>The anti-vaccination movement, whose conspiracy-like claims shift as they're repeatedly debunked, thrives on a kind of reborn superstition, mainly by connecting vaccination to autism. It's a perfect example of pseudo-religious irrationality in that it offers conscientious parents a simple way to protect their children against something complex and frightening – autism.</p>
<p>Which would be great, if it were remotely true, because it would mean that bad things don't happen to good people. Which would be really great.</p>
<p>Ask people who have had cancer and they'll tell you that the initial sympathetic response of their associates quickly becomes a kind of 20-questions game designed to determine how the newly diagnosed people brought this cancer upon themselves.</p>
<p>As the mother of a child who was for a long time highly “special needs,” I was sometimes tempted to tell horrified new or pregnant mothers who witnessed the grimmer moments of our lives that “I drank heavily only in the first trimester,” just to put their minds at ease. They would never be us. Too good. Too clever.</p>
<p>People keep announcing that they're “buying vitamins” in response to H1N1, which ignores the dual realities that immunizations work best when as many people as possible are immunized (in an orderly fashion and beginning always with the Calgary Flames) and that healthy people do become ill.</p>
<p>Historically, people routinely watched healthy people get sick and die at home – as we seldom do. Having few other options, they fought back mostly with a kind of magical thinking, believing in an imbalance of humours and in “the cursed.”</p>
<p>Here again, having gone past dull science – which has, after all, failed to save every last one of us from everything – we're now coming around 360 degrees to attempting to ward off illness, simplified as evil, with insider information.</p>
<p>“I'm boosting my immune system,” people keep saying to me, beatifically.</p>
<p>The phrase is like a new “Hail, Mary, mother of God” – it's said as if the mere know-ledge of the words, and the things the utterance of those words suggests about the speaker, provided special protection.</p>

<p>Re: Health Minister Tells Athletes To Get In Line, Nov. 6.</p>
<p>Like many Canadians, I have been following the H1N1 stories, and I understand why high priority groups have been designated. The list of groups deemed eligible to receive the vaccine ahead of the general population makes sense to me -- with one exception. The exclusion of preschool teachers and daycare workers from this list is simply wrong. Why should they be exposed to high-risk children every day with no "front-of-the-line" opportunity to guard themselves against the virus? They should be just as "high priority" as a person living with an infant under six months. While their students may be eligible to receive priority, not all of them will receive the vaccine. We rely on these teachers and daycare workers each day, and they never signed up to put their health and wellbeing on the line. The high-priority list should be expanded to include this important, overlooked group.</p>

The Premier pledged to help, announcing Ontario would provide logistical and organizational support. He later admitted the subterfuge was meant to avoid tipping off rivals for the 2015 Games.</p>
<p>Mr. Rana is said to be able to sway up to 10 PASO votes. And yesterday's victory -- Toronto won 33 of 52 votes on the first ballot -- suggests the city had learned something from being a perpetual loser when it comes to international athletics. "You never know what people do at a ballot box," said David Peterson, bid committee chairman. "I've been in elections and the best guy doesn't always win."</p>
<p>At its general assembly in Guadalajara, PASO members yesterday awarded Toronto the region's first major international sporting event since the British Empire Games in Hamilton in 1930. The city beat out Bogota, Colombia and Lima, Peru,</p>
<p>The Premier was not the only powerful lobbyist in Toronto's corner --Mr. McGuinty's visit last August was just one of many shuttle diplomacy missions carried out over the past year and a half in pursuit of the Games by politicians, members of the Canadian Olympic Committee and Mr. Peterson.</p>
<p>A former Liberal premier himself, Mr. Peterson said throughout the effort that Toronto could have had the most technically competent bid of the three, but that the vote would come down to regional alliances, long-time loyalties and personal ties.</p>
<p>While Toronto Mayor David Miller was a latecomer to the Pan Am party and Prime Minister Stephen Harper more of a silent partner, the Premier became an early and persuasive champion of the Games. Insiders say Mr. Mc-Guinty's relentless effort to court votes by forging allegiances with key powerbrokers made the difference in a race that prizes friendship and personal relationships.</p>
<p>Even though Presidents Alvaro Uribe of Colombia and Alan Garcia of Peru showed up for the PASO vote yesterday to throw their weight behind their respective country's bids, the Toronto bid had a head start. It goes back nearly two years, with an earlier, lower-profile visit to Mr. Rana's mansion.</p>
<p>In early 2008, Paul Henderson, a former Canadian member of the International Olympic Committee, and Mike Chambers, president of the Canadian Olympic Committee, paid the first of what were to be multiple visits to Mr. Rana.</p>
<p>They wanted to sound him out on Toronto's chances of nabbing a Pan Am Games. Mr. Henderson and Mr. Chambers returned home encouraged by Mr. Rana's openness, but publicly cautioned it wouldn't be worth mounting a bid unless the Premier signed on as a stalwart booster.</p>
<p>Ontario's economy was thriving at the time and Mr. McGuinty, perhaps looking ahead to a popular and tangible legacy for his government, quickly endorsed the idea.</p>
<p>But before he could start lobbying the members of the national Olympic committees who also vote on awarding Pan Am Games, Mr. McGuinty realized he had some arms to twist at home. Mr. Harper had to be convinced not only to back the bid, but to help finance it. His office professed him receptive, but months passed and there was still no firm commitment.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Beijing Olympics, the federal OK came through and Mr. McGuinty jetted off to "plant the flag" for Toronto as a Pan Am host city. It was at the Beijing Games that Mr. McGuinty first met Mr. Rana and had a private 45-minute meeting with him to discuss Toronto's nascent bid.</p>
<p>The Premier also hosted a Pan-Am-themed lunch, with cuisine from around the Americas and the Caribbean. He came home feeling Toronto was "clearly in the running" for the Games and appointed the able and affable Mr. Peterson to head the effort.</p>
<p>"I think we need a win here," Mr. McGuinty said in September 2008. "I think it's really important for us to enjoy success together that has some resonance on the international scene."</p>
<p>But the Premier still had more convincing to do. While mayors of cities across the GTA were eagerly jockeying to be part of the games, Toronto's David Miller was recalcitrant. He publicly expressed his concern about Toronto getting stuck with a bill for spiralling costs and was accused by Mr. Henderson of "sitting around with [his] finger up [his] bum."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller needed reassurances about cost overruns. He also had his own vision for the Games' legacy, in line with his</p>
<p>Scan this bar code with your smartphone to watch The Dream,</p>
<p>Toronto's Pan Am Games tribute video, or visit nationalpost.com/postedtorontoWhat's this bar code? See A2</p>
<p>agenda for bringing transit and sports infrastructure to low-income neighbourhoods.</p>
<p>"It's that kind of thing that interests me," the Mayor said then.</p>
<p>The initial $1.7-billion bid was officially launched on the Exhibition grounds one rainy, windy day in early October of last year. Mr. Miller put on his game face for the event, reminiscing about the powerful memories he had of attending the Montreal Olympics as a teenager. The next week the bid committee, led by Mr. McGuinty, headed off to Guadalajara to kick off the year-long seduction effort.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Ontario's economy tanked, with the faltering auto sector and Bay Street sucker-punched by the global financial meltdown. The federal government scaled back its original $700-million commitment to the Games. The bid could have crumbled there.</p>
<p>But Mr. McGuinty pledged the province would continue to backstop the budget while containing costs. As economic stimulus through public infrastructure investment presented itself as the popular solution to the crisis, the plan to revitalize Ontario sporting facilities through the Games only reinforced the Premier's resolve.</p>
<p>In May, Toronto unveiled its official bid book at Queen's Park, detailing plans for facilities and venues -- albeit on a scaled-back budget of $1.4-billion.</p>
<p>It was hand-delivered to Mr. Rana the next day, a few weeks later than initially anticipated after the PASO chief's toddler grandson succumbed to the first wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>There were two crucial tests Toronto had to pass in order to win.</p>
<p>The first was a site visit by the PASO evaluation committee in August. This involved not only tours of proposed venues, such as the athletes' village planned for the West Don Lands neighbourhood and the Olympic-size pool at the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus, but wining and dining the delegation -- and essentially showing them a good time.</p>
<p>On the eve of the visit the federal government came through with an announcement it would waive visa requirements for athletes, coaches and officials attending the Games in 2015. A contentious hurdle to Toronto's bid was now removed.</p>
<p>The weather also co-operated. After a damp and cool summer, the two days the evaluation committee passed through town dawned warm and sunny. There was breakfast atop the CN Tower, a helicopter flight over Niagara Falls and a wrap-up dinner at a yacht club on Toronto Island.</p>
<p>The only dark cloud on the horizon was the sudden emergence of protesters, who threatened to undermine the Pan Am bid in much the same way as movements that vociferously opposed Toronto's Olympic hopes. They turned out to be no threat -- little more than a few dozen mainly student demonstrators who could barely muster the strength to hold their hand-painted banner aloft outside the Rogers Centre, where the evaluation committee offered its impressions of Toronto.</p>
<p>Julio Cesar Magliore, chair of the PASO evaluation team, offered cautious praise for Toronto. He said the highways, transit and athletics facilities were "top notch."</p>
<p>"It is a beautiful city that has big development and progress in every moment," Dr. Magliore said. "I have no doubt you meet all the requirements to have an excellent Games."</p>
<p>In late September, the Premier embarked on yet another overseas mission to Copenhagen for a meeting of the IOC. It was one last opportunity for an in-person lobbying effort by Mr. McGuinty.</p>
<p>Back home, finishing touches were being put on Toronto 2015's final presentation to PASO, to be delivered on the final day of PASO's convention -- yesterday. A combination of in-person commentary, video and music, it was written and rewritten countless times and rehearsed at the Metro Convention Centre.</p>
<p>It also contained a rousing anthem composed by the Canadian Tenors and sung in English and Spanish. "I cry every time I hear it," Mr. Peterson admitted.</p>
<p>While all the groundwork has been laid, he said much was riding on the presentation and the "button-holing" of delegates over the three days of the general assembly.</p>
<p>The Presidents of Colombia and Peru may have turned up in Guadalajara yesterday, but Toronto's heavyweights were already well known to the PASO delegates casting ballots -- especially Mr. Rana, said Bob Richardson, a senior advisor to the Toronto bid.</p>
<p>"We would not be here today if it was not for Premier McGuinty. Period, full stop," said Mr. Richardson. "He's met them all over the world, he's been on the phone with them. He's gone to visit Vazquez Rana at his house in Mexico City. The Premier's left no stone unturned."</p>

<p>The B.C. legislature sat last night and debate could continue into the weekend on back-to-work legislation for striking ambulance paramedics.</p>
<p>The Opposition NDP has called the legislation draconian, but Liberals have said it's necessary given the H1N1 pandemic and the approaching holiday season.</p>
<p>Liberal house leader Mike de Jong has said the government intends to pass the legislation in the next few days. The legislature takes a break next week and government doesn't want to wait that long to end the strike, he said.</p>
<p>"The ambulance service is critical to providing emergency health services, and now, more than ever, it needs to be operating at full capacity," he said.</p>
<p>NDP house leader Mike Farnworth, however, has argued that the government should stick to its legislative calendar and debate the bill when the legislature returns after the break.</p>

<div>H1n1 Flu</div>
<div id="hd"><b>B.C. outbreak likely to worsen in coming weeks</b>
</div><div>Randy Shore   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>483 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>New cases of the H1N1 flu pandemic gripping B.C. will likely continue to rise until the last week of November or the first week of December, according to a scientist at the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Despite a startling rise in the number of hospitalizations over the week ending Nov. 2, the outbreak will continue to worsen for several more weeks at least, said Babak Pourbohloul, director of the division of mathematical modelling at the BCCDC.</p>
<p>"The parameter values added to the model over the past few weeks suggest that it would be more probable to have a peak at the end of November or early December," he said.</p>
<p>Pourbohloul said the "vast majority of the simulations" the centre has done give a range of three to five weeks from now as the likely zenith for infections.</p>
<p>"It really depends on how fast you can immunize the population," said Pourbohloul. "The exact shape of the peak may not be attainable; we'll have to wait and see what it looks like."</p>
<p>The problem is that pandemic viruses learn how to infect humans much faster than we can learn how to stop them. And viruses such as H1N1 that make the jump from another species catch humans with their defences down.</p>
<p>The virus is not recognizable to our immune systems, Pourbohloul explained. "So we may be completely susceptible to the virus."</p>
<p>When most of the human population lacks immunity, the virus spreads much faster than a typical seasonal virus, which would bump up against potential hosts (that's us) with varying degrees of immunity that slow its spread.</p>
<p>"At the moment, the H1N1 flu is burning through the population like a wildfire in a tinder-dry forest," said University of Toronto epidemiologist David Fisman, a researcher for the MITACS (Mathematics of Information Technology and Complex Systems) network based in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Each year's seasonal flu strains are a recirculation of slightly mutated old strains that many of us are already partly or completely immune to, explained Fisman.</p>
<p>Conversely, swine flu has the potential to infect almost everyone born since 1957, when it last faded out of existence as a human flu virus.</p>
<p>"People born before 1957 had a lot of exposure to H1N1 when they were kids," Fisman said. Health authorities do not consider people over 65 as a high-risk group for H1N1, even though they have a higher risk of death, because almost all of them are immune to it.</p>
<p>"We are dealing with two different kinds of risk," said Fisman. "Young people are a very, very high risk of being infected with this virus, but a very low risk of a bad outcome. Older people are at low risk to contract the swine flu, but a high risk of a bad outcome."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Victoria school board gets a financial break; $3.85 million will help trustees deal with any 'emergent' issue</b>
</div><div>Jeff Bell   </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>493 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>The Greater Victoria school district has some financial breathing room, now that the Ministry of Education has given it access to an extra $3.85 million.</p>
<p>"What it does mean is that in an emergent issue, we have the money," said Greater Victoria board of education chairman Tom Ferris. "We need contingency money for emergencies."</p>
<p>The board requested the money in late September after losing $4 million when the ministry cancelled the annual facilities grant for school districts. The Saanich district lost $1.5 million and the Sooke district lost $1.9 million in the process, which saw $110 million in grants cut as part of government cost-saving efforts.</p>
<p>Annual facilities grants are used for maintenance and upgrades at schools.</p>
<p>The financial help for Greater Victoria district comes from a $6-million pool of money known as re-stricted capital funds. While the funds are held by the district, they can be re-leased for use only by the Ministry of Education, which has largely directed the money to seismic projects.</p>
<p>Ferris said the $3.85 million now at the district's disposal might be used for earthquake-preparedness work, such as adding to the seismic project underway at Willows Elementary, but it could also be used for other needs that may akrise during the school year.</p>
<p>"If we want to do something at Willows over and above what the earthquake funding allows us to do, then we have some discretion. And there will be furnace upgrades, that type of thing, as they come up."</p>
<p>Other items the funding could help with include $150,000 for energy-efficient condensing boilers at three schools where solar-wall projects have been approved, and window improvements at three other schools.</p>
<p>"We'll just get right back on track to where we were," Ferris said.</p>
<p>Greater Victoria was among the first school districts to request use of its restricted capital funding. Sooke has since done the same, but has yet to hear from the ministry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ferris said the Greater Victoria district is still waiting to hear from the ministry after re-questing funds to offset the cost of bringing in H1N1-prevention measures. The district's basic H1N1-related costs were estimated at over $40,000 in a letter to Minister of Education Margaret MacDiarmid.</p>
<p>Installation of hand sanitizers in classrooms without sinks was cited as one of the major expenses, while the costs of more cleaning supplies and the anticipated need for more teachers on call to replace sick staff members were not included in the tally.</p>
<p>The Sooke and Saanich districts have also been tracking their H1N1-related expenses.</p>
<p>Saanich has factored additional cleaning, staff training and absenteeism into its H1N1-related costs and estimates the total bill to be $250,000.</p>

<p>The number of local cases of H1N1 flu has increased sharply this week, in keeping with the national trend.</p>
<p>"We have seen a significant increase in the last week," said Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann.</p>
<p>He said there have been 107 cases of H1N1 flu confirmed in Windsor and Essex County, with another 112 cases identified as influenza but not yet sub-typed as H1N1.</p>
<p>"I can almost guarantee they will be H1N1," said Heimann, which would bring the total to 229, about double the total at the end of last week.</p>
<p>Heimann said there has been no indication when the next shipment of H1N1 vaccine will be coming from Health Canada, but the Windsor-Essex County Health Unit will have enough vaccine to get through a weekend clinic.</p>
<p>"We have enough to meet demand for our weekend clinics, and the one in LaSalle on Monday. Beyond that I just can't say."</p>
<p>There is a vaccination clinic for priority groups being held today at the old Windsor Armouries at 37 University Ave. E. from 9 a.m. until 4 p.m.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vitamin firm expands, more jobs ahead; Buying Twin Oaks Drive site</b>
</div><div>Doug Schmidt   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>

<p>Windsor's booming Jamieson Laboratories Inc., Canada's top-ranked vitamin manufacturer, is moving into soft gelatin capsules in a big way as it finalizes purchase of a new Twin Oaks industrial facility as part of a $15-million expansion.</p>
<p>The sale, expected to close next week, will see the company take over the former W.E.T. Automotive Systems building on 7.8 acres at 9475 Twin Oaks Dr. and then transfer over the current soft gel operations of International Nutrient Technologies on Argyle Road.</p>
<p>Jamieson had an operating agreement with a Montreal investment group that took over the former GelCell Capsules Ltd. operations on Argyle after it went into receivership in 2008. The approximately 55 remaining employees will be moved to the new Jamieson facility when it opens in about a year, but president Vic Neufeld expects that workforce could eventually double in size.</p>
<p>The Argyle building, a city heritage structure behind the Ottawa Street Market, is "fraught with problems," including asbestos, he said.</p>
<p>In order to increase its soft gel business, Jamieson has to prove to potential new clients it can maintain production facilities to top "pharma standards," he said.</p>
<p>"The major pharmaceutical companies need to have complete trust that we meet their standards," said Neufeld.</p>
<p>He said on Argyle "we were handcuffed with the aging old plant."</p>
<p>Jamieson was close to a deal with the city to purchase Windsor Airport lands adjoining its 4025 Rhodes Dr. facility when the WET Automotive opportunity came up that, from a business perspective, couldn't be ignored.</p>
<p>But given the company's current trend, Neufeld said there's "a good probability" Jamieson will be seeking more space and another expansion in three to five years.</p>
<p>Neufeld, a Leamington native, said there's a good chance the five-acre airport parcel it had been eyeing could again be considered.</p>
<p>Neufeld said expanding into the airport lands now would have meant paying more than a million dollars to extend municipal services, but that work is now being funded by taxpayers as part of Windsor's servicing of airport lands under Ottawa's infrastructure stimulus program.</p>
<p>"They're in Windsor -- that's all I care about," Mayor Eddie Francis said of Jamieson's latest expansion plans that avoid airport lands.</p>
<p>He said the city "moved heaven and earth" to get the company to expand locally.</p>
<p>Whenever talk turns to expansion, Neufeld said Jamieson's Toronto-based board of directors and chairman put the pressure on him to consider the Greater Toronto Area.</p>
<p>And he said he's constantly "bombarded with offers from commercial realtors with some great properties" in that region.</p>
<p>But Neufeld said his focus is on the home front and "going with the people who got us here," namely Windsor workers and managers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with more and more people "taking a lot of their health maintenance into their own hands," Neufeld said his company is seeing unprecedented growth.</p>
<p>With the advent of cold and flu season and the ongoing public scare over H1N1 swine flu, he said Jamieson has seen a "surge" in sales, far surpassing forecasts and leading to "vanished" stockloads of its top 50 products.</p>
<p>In the vitamin C category alone, sales over the past two months more than doubled over the same period last year, he said.</p>
<p>Jamieson employs about 500 people coast-to-coast, with about 30 employees in marketing at its Toronto executive office and about 80 sales staff there and at field offices across Canada.</p>

<p>Our social networks shape everything from our emotions and who we marry to how much we weigh, a new book says, and the way we interact suggests the most effective strategy to combat H1N1 is to vaccinate the most popular people.</p>
<p>Connected: The Surprising Power of Our Social Networks and How They Shape Our Lives explores how we're less a collection of rugged individualists than we are woven together as a "human superorganism."</p>
<p>"If you have a herd of buffalo and they're all stampeding, running forward and suddenly they all turn to the left, you could go and tap on one of the buffalo's shoulders and say, 'Why are you turning to the left?' And the buffalo would look at you quizzically: 'I'm turning to the left because everyone else is turning to the left,"' says co-author James Fowler, a professor at the University of California, San Diego. "A lot of times we end up doing things in synchrony that we're not even aware of because we're part of this larger entity that's a result of all these complex interconnections."</p>
<p>When they map out a human social network, it looks like an aerial view of a party, Fowler says, with the social butterflies at the centre connected to many people and the lone wolves on the periphery with fewer connections.</p>
<p>Given that pattern, researchers have found that randomly choosing people, asking them to name a good friend and vaccinating the friend provides as much protection to the population against communicable diseases like H1N1 as three times the number of vaccines administered at random, he says. The reason is that a social animal with 10 close friends is 10 times more likely to be named than someone with one friend, and also more likely to have contact with more people and pass along disease, Fowler says.</p>
<p>In studying how happiness, depression, loneliness, smoking and even obesity spread through social networks, he and his co-author, Nicholas Christakis of Harvard University, found that people influence others up to three degrees of separation but no further.</p>
<p>The authors detail a bizarre case of emotional contagion where a laughter epidemic shut down entire schools and villages in Tanzania for several months in 1962. Researchers who descended on the area to document the phenomenon reported -- with straight faces -- that "no fatal cases have been reported."</p>
<p>An epidemic of a different type struck an affluent suburb of Atlanta in 1996 when 17 teenagers showed up at clinics with syphilis -- a sexually transmitted disease almost unheard-of in upper-middle-class kids. It turned out the syphilis was only the symptom, the authors write, and what was really spreading among the teens was the idea that group sex and dozens of partners for 14-year-olds were the norm.</p>
<p>"These networks and these ideas that we have can be just as dangerous to public health as anything we do biologically to our system," Fowler says.</p>
<p>But this interconnectedness doesn't erode the concept of free will or let people off the hook for their actions, he says.</p>
<p>"A reaction a lot of people have to the work is, 'Well, this means that I'm not responsible for what happens to me," he says. "And we turn this on its head and say that while it's true that there are hundreds of people you don't know and have never met that have an influence on you, you also have a small influence on them."</p>

</p>
<p>Dear Letters to the Editor</p>
<p>It has come to my attention that some people have been getting the H1N1 vaccine before me. I don't want to cry about it, but it does make it seem like there is a two-teared healthcare system. It's like the authorities have already made up their minds about whose life is more important, mine or other people I don't even know.</p>
<p>As you know, residents of the inner city got to get the vaccination first. Excuse me, but I thought this was a democracy. I'm not saying that the poor people shouldn't receive health care. It's just that they shouldn't receive health care before I do.</p>
<p>There are several reasons for this. First of all, I am wealthy. My grandparents worked very hard so that I could have an easy life. This commitment should not be ignored, if my opinion is going to be believed.</p>
<p>Being rich is not something that I take for granted. Believe me, I appreciate it every day I sit on the heated leather seats of my luxury European inspired sports sedan.</p>
<p>But with affluence comes responsibility. I don't sit around all day drinking vintage port from one of my wine cellars. I am a businessman and essential member of the community. My firm employs over 30 people in the 'As Seen On TV' industry. Our latest invention is Slamdice. You'll no doubtedly be seeing the commercials soon. Slamdice cuts and cubes everything from onions to garlic simply and easily. Our slogan is "Why have a boring knife?" We're also working on a self-contained cheese grater called the Shreddy. We'll be rolling out our product line in time for the Christmas buying frenzy.</p>
<p>What does this have to do with H1N1? is a question you might ask not only rhetorically but symbolically as well. I am glad that you asked. This is our busiest time of year. I simply can't afford the "downtime" that would come with having my workforce deluded by the flu. Small businesses are the back bone of the economy. They provide jobs to people who turn around and buy houses and groceries and pay income tax. And I'm not too shy to admit that it also earns me a good living as an entrepreneur to go a long with my healthy inheritance. This keeps our entire fiscal system in balance.</p>
<p>Now picture those same jobs not being there. ECONOMIC COLLAPSE! Governments will feel the pinch with all the taxes that aren't coming in and they will run out of money to write those big fat unemployment and welfare checks that the people who are in the front of the vaccination line-up just can't wait to cash. In other words, you won't have much health care for anyone if you don't put the upper classes at the top of the priority list. No one has the gall to actually say this out loud, which is why I'm writing this letter.</p>
<p>If you need proof that some people are simply more important than others, look no further than to your left to Alberta and how they handled the issue with the Calgary Flames. Knowing that the entertainment of the populace was paramount, and that the lives of athletes earning millions of dollars a year are intrinsically more valuable than people who can't afford skates (much less season tickets!), those in charge ensured that not only these players but their wives, families and girlfriends were in-occulated for the virus. People whined about this so called 'queue-jumping.' But this is invalid because in Canada we don't actually use the word "queue" and secondly, it's not hockey's fault that it coincides with the flu season.</p>
<p>Putting the rich at the head of the line is actually a motivator. The poor will be inspired to pull themselves up by the bootstraps and start contributing to society. If they get a good job or learn how to play hockey really well, one day they too will deserve special treatment.</p>
<p>My wife Lovey and I were discussing this issue at the club recently over some chilled Dom and platinum-encrusted prawns, and she made a good point: "Why are we assuming that poor people even want to be first in line?" It's possible that they don't want to be singled out. Some might find it humiliating, and no one deserves to be astigmatized in that fashion.</p>
<p>In addition to the economic and social arguments, there's the notion of travel and tourism. People like me with large amounts of disposable income often take winter vacations to get away from winter. It is pure folly to let these people board their cruise ships without having had their H1N1 shot. Imagine the tragic sight of a whole shipload of sick rich people! Golfing in Arizona, too, needless to say.</p>
<p>And it's not just the wealthy who deserve special treatment. Good looking people do too. Beautiful women and handsome men give us all hope. Their health must not be compromised! In order for our species to evolve, the hot must be allowed to survive and reproduce. This isn't just me talking, it's Darwin. And speaking of evolution, heaven help us if movie stars get pushed to the back of the line. A world where celebrities can get the flu is one I don't want to know about.</p>
<p>In closing, since when did being well-off become a crime? But I am a reasonable person. I am willing to compromise. If the government can't see fit to allow my social circle to be needled first, at least they could let all citizens go at the same time. I'm sure a few dollars in an envelope would entice the rummy ahead of me to trade spaces. This is called free enterprise, by the way, and it's the sand on which the foundation of our society is built upon. Look it up.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Rich R. Richards,</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Fort Hood tragedy explodes on Twitter</b>

</p>
<p>It was a sobering start to Trending Topics this week with the massacre at Fort Hood, Texas dominating Twitter. Extensive reporting by @NYTimes provided regular updates on the shooting which killed 13 people and wounded 28 (other estimates vary). The New York Times used the new "lists" feature of Twitter to aggregate news on the tragedy from a wide variety of news sources, effectively creating a Twitter wire as part of its reporting.</p>
<p>One of those sources, @NewsChannel25 reported "Troubling portrait emerges of Fort Hood suspect: His name appears on radical Internet postings."</p>
<p>Various Muslim groups, including @americanislamic, condemned the act as anti-Islamic and cowardly:</p>
<p>"@americanislamic Expressly condemns the shooting at Fort Hood. Our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected."</p>
<p>The general populace mostly tweeted prayers, updates and news bulletins, but the occasional post was filled with vitriol and hate.</p>
<p>News emerged this week that the general populace, at least on social networking sites, is changing dramatically. ReadWriteWeb, one of the top 20 blogs in the world, reported on new social network demographics; "As <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> Ages, Gen Y Turns to Twitter."</p>
<p>"@rww Twitter is the second-youngest of the top 4 SNS, median age 31. MySpace is 26, LinkedIn 39, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> 33"</p>
<p>Interesting how <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> started young and is aging whereas Twitter started old and is finding the fountain of youth, no doubt due to Hollywood's star presence in Twitterville.</p>
<p>Speaking of assimilation, <span class="companylink">Motorola</span> launched its new flagship smart-phone "DROID" this week to much fanfare. Dubbed by some the "iPhone killer" (in a long line of wanna-be contenders), the DROID generated a lot of iPhone-like chatter but significantly less traffic at the mall. In the words of tech blog @engadget:</p>
<p>"DROID mania sweeps the nation, so to speak"</p>
<p>Mania did sweep New York thanks to the Yankees' World Series win. Photos, video, joy and disappointment were shared, but, according to @calaggie, CBS Executive Leslie Moonves had a unique perspective:</p>
<p>"Heh. Leslie Moonves mentions 'those pesky Yankees' during the CBS Q3 earnings call."</p>
<p>He was probably miffed all those New Yorkers were at the parade and not buying TV ads.</p>
<p>Over on <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> one of the highlighted videos this week was a CTV News clip posted by "thehillwatcher." The clip exposes the hypocrisy of Liberals bashing the Conservatives on the exclusivity of the flu vaccine contract when it was the Chretien government that awarded the contract in 2001.</p>
<p>Finally, this week Calgarians learned the way to get the H1N1 flu vaccine is to be a millionaire hockey player, not a high-risk pregnant mom. AlbertaCowpoke reported on NowPublic.com "Calgary Flames jump H1N1 Queue amidst Vaccination Clinic Closures."</p>
<p>As usual, send your cards and letters with hashtag #RTWT on Twitter so I can highlight the weird and wonderful stuff you see on the social web, tweet me at @dblacombe or e-mail doug@communicatto.com.</p>

<p>According to Us Weekly, a former squeeze of Alex Rodriguez says the New York Yankees star has two portraits of himself hanging over his bed. In the artwork, A-Rod is portrayed as a centaur. That explains why he keeps acting like a horse's ass ... A parade was held in New York City on Friday to celebrate the Yankees' victory over the Philadelphia Phillies in the World Series. Rodriguez did his part by pulling a float ... If the Yankees ever make a blockbuster trade involving Rodriguez, will it be known as the Deal of the Centaur-y? ... Just hours after the Yankees' Game 6 victory, New York manager Joe Girardi pulled over to help a woman who had been involved in a car crash. The cops credited Girardi with a save.</p>
<p>Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Vicente Padilla suffered a bullet wound to a leg the other day after he was shot accidentally by a target-shooting instructor in Managua, Nicaragua. The instructor obviously doesn't know much about baseball; he missed the bag ... ESPN baseball analyst Steve Phillips was fired -- and subsequently checked himself into a rehab facility for sexual addictions -- after admitting he had an affair with an intern. "Between this guy and (David) Letterman," noted comedy writer Alex Kaseberg, "these TV guys are really putting the in in intern." ... Speaking of Dave, New York City Marathon winner Meb Keflezighi appeared on Letterman's Late Show and read the "Top 10 Thoughts That Go Through Your Mind When Running the New York City Marathon." Among the items on the list were "Cool! MapQuest found a route that's only five miles," "Why can I run 26 miles in less time than it takes to play a World Series game?" and "I really hope that was Gatorade."</p>
<p>This week's wacky soccer story comes from the British Isles, where a survey of 2,000 schoolchildren in advance of Remembrance Day found that one in 20 kids between the ages of nine and 11 thought Adolf Hitler was a German soccer coach. Uh, kids? Those weren't "away friendlies" the Germans were playing in countries like Czechoslovakia, Poland, Denmark, Norway, France, Holland, Belgium and the Soviet Union ... The NHL's Calgary Flames were denounced this week after their players were vaccinated against the H1N1 flu virus before other high-risk groups got their inoculations. It's believed to be the first time ever that a hockey team has been criticized for taking shots ... Some members of the Toronto Maple Leafs also received their H1N1 vaccinations. Attempts to inoculate goalie Vesa Toskala were unsuccessful, though, as every shot went between his legs.</p>
<p>University of Nebraska Cornhuskers nose tackle Ndamukong Suh was given only a ticket on Sunday morning after the vehicle he was driving hit three parked cars on a street in Lincoln, Neb. "Suh, whose blood-alcohol content was within the legal limit, told police he swerved to avoid hitting a dog," noted Reggie Hayes of the Fort Wayne News-Sentinel. "Later, that same dog ate his homework." ... Dallas Cowboys receiver Roy Williams is off to a slow start, but Cowboys owner Jerry Jones dismissed it by telling reporters: "It normally takes two to three years for a receiver to really come into his own." Noted Steve Schrader of the Detroit Free Press: "So those five with the Lions don't count?"</p>
<p>Cleveland Cavaliers centre Shaquille O'Neal said this week that he and his Cavs teammate, Zydrunas Ilgauskas, are the best centres in the NBA. "Well," added Janice Hough, the Left Coast Sports Babe, "maybe for those playing the sports edition of Scrabble." ... The last word this week goes to former Boston Celtics star and current TNT analyst Kevin McHale, who suggested referees have given preferential treatment to certain players forever -- and he experienced it first-hand during his rookie season of 1980-81. Recalled McHale: "I go up to do what I think is a good block, and they blow the whistle. They yell, 'Foul on No. 32.' I said, '32? You mean 33? Larry (Bird) is the one who fouled him.' (The ref) said, 'You want Larry to have three or you to have one?' I said, 'My foul!' "</p>

<p>It appears that the Saskatchewan Roughriders are no longer flu-riddled.</p>
<p>Riders head coach Ken Miller said Friday that the team is healthier than it has been for two or three weeks heading into today's CFL game against the Calgary Stampeders at Mosaic Stadium.</p>
<p>None of the players missed practice this week due to the flu. Last week, the Riders had five players absent at times with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"We haven't had any new reports of the flu,'' Miller said. "We've had some reports about head colds but that's about it.''</p>
<p>There have been some reports about some sports teams looking to jump ahead of civilians when it comes to being vaccinated for the H1N1 virus. There are concerns that athletes in a team setting may be more susceptible to the flu strain because of their proximity to each other and the travel demands that may weaken some players. Miller doesn't feel that the Riders deserve special treatment.</p>
<p>"Those in need in the regular population should be first to get the vaccine,'' Miller said. "We should get it after those who need it most get theirs.''</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Miller met Friday morning with disgruntled defensive end Stevie Baggs to discuss the results of the first round of voting for the CFL's defensive player-of-the-year award.</p>
<p>John Chick, who plays the other defensive end, was selected as the nominee by Miller and a panel representing the Football Reporters of Canada. Baggs said Thursday he was happy for Chick but wondered why he wasn't selected based on his superior statistics.</p>
<p>"I talked to him about being team-oriented and (Baggs) talked about being humble,'' said Miller.</p>
<p>"Generally on a team there are individuals, some of whom are more transparent than others and some who might be more vocal. In every interview that he conducted, Stevie congratulated John before he talked about the things he had accomplished, like being the defensive player-of-the-week three times and the player-of-the-month. Those are reasons why he might have had reasonable expectations for being a strong candidate.</p>
<p>"Stevie understands that it's a team game and he's going to sublimate himself for the team. He won't be divisive in the locker room.''</p>
<p>After Friday's walk-through, Baggs shook hands with some members of the media and thanked them for the extra motivation heading into today's game.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Roughriders quarterback Darian Durant wants to give tonight's game the ol' college try.</p>
<p>Tonight's West Division first-place showdown with Calgary reminds Durant of a big game he played at the University of North Carolina in 2004.</p>
<p>"We played Miami in my senior year,'' Durant remembered. "They were ranked No. 3 in the country. It was like game eight of the season. They were having national-championship talk and things like that. They came into Chapel Hill and we ended up beating them on the field goal with no time left. I led the team down on the last-second drive. If I had to relate this game to any big-time game that I've had, it would be that one.''</p>
<p>Even then, Durant was noted for late-game heroics.</p>
<p>"But the thing is, you don't want to be in those situations,'' he said with a chuckle. "You do sometimes to see how you respond, but everyone loves a blowout. To blow this team out in front of our home crowd, as much as this crowd has been through and (with) the things they have to say about Henry (Burris, Stampeders quarterback) and things like that, I would love for that to be the case (tonight).''</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Chick is the featured member of the Riders on pennants being sold before today's game.</p>
<p>The pennants are available for a minimum donation of $10. Proceeds are to be directed towards the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. It's a cause that is close to Chick, a Type I diabetic who wears an insulin pump to control the disease.</p>
<p>"That's a project the Riders have taken on this year and it has been awesome,'' said Chick. "Proceeds from the sales go to a charity and it means a lot for the Riders to be part of it. It means a lot to me this week to help and support JDRF and raise awareness as well. I'm sure that the heads and minds of most people will be other places and that's where they should be. Hopefully we'll be able to do some good.''</p>

<p>RJ Currie, after Andre Agassi claimed he lost the 1990 French Open final because he was wearing a hairpiece and was concerned about accidentally ripping it off: "That's got to be the worst excuse ever; he lost because he was afraid of having the rug pulled out from over him?" . . . An estimated 700 million people worldwide would like to move to a different country, according to a Gallup poll. Wouldn't it be wonderful if one of those wanting to live in Canada was Alexander Ovechkin? . . . Janice Hough, after Kobe Bryant played earlier this week for the Lakers against the Thunder despite flu-like symptoms: "Apparently neither team was worried about H1N1, figuring, it's Kobe, he never passes on anything." . . . The perfect scenario for Alex Rodriguez's much-discussed World Series home run would have had the ball hitting a camera brought to the game by Jeffrey Maier and landing in the hands of Steve Bartman . . .</p>
<p> Bill Littlejohn, after Yankees manager Joe Girardi stopped to help out at a car crash scene on the way home from winning the World Series: "This is no surprise; after all, Girardi helped clean up the Rodriguez train wreck." . . . Please, please, please Regina media people, no more Darian Durant stories or columns until he walks on water . . . Vancouver comic Torben Rolfsen, on the movie The Men Who Stare At Goats opening this weekend: "Finally, a documentary on Bill Buckner and the 1986 World Series." . . . It is now alleged Oakland Raiders coach Tom Cable assaulted two women. Why can't he be like everyone else and stick to beating up assistant coaches?</p>
<p>One of the most interesting places I visited in Philadelphia was Carpenters' Hall. It is famous as being the building where, in 1774, colonial leaders met just before the American Revolution to condemn the actions of the British. Among those at this historic meeting were Patrick Henry, John and Sam Adams, and Chris Chelios . . . If Carpenters' Hall had been built in Saskatoon, it would have been demolished for a parking lot . . . Currie, after reality TV star Kim Kardashian took part in a charity boxing match and got a shiner: "Reports say she is a sight for sore eyes." . . . Stephen Colbert's TV show is now the primary sponsor of U.S. speed skating. Here are three other possible sponsorship deals: 3. David Letterman -- a college intern program; 2. Plaxico Burress -- trapshooting; 1. the Calgary Flames -- the H1N1 roll out . . . Jeff Funnekotter, on the big uproar in Alberta this week as Flames players were among the first to receive H1N1 vaccinations: "No such problem in Toronto -- there's no way the Leafs would come close to first." . . . Littlejohn, after Boston Bruins centre David Krejci was diagnosed with H1N1: "He reportedly asked to be taken to Calgary for speedy treatment." . . . One more on the same topic, this one from Derek Wilken: "Professional athletes have been called pigs for years, but when they try to get a shot for it everyone calls them line jumpers." . . . One Toronto report would have us believe Steve Yzerman was in Hogtown this week to scout Vincent Lecavalier, Martin St. Louis, Steve Stamkos and Francois Beauchemin. Which one doesn't belong? . . . Currie, when asked how many Maple Leafs jokes he thought were out there: "No more than five, plus a goalie."</p>
<p>It's not shocking that broadcaster Jim Nantz has to pay his ex-wife $1 million per year as part of their divorce settlement or that she was awarded their six-bedroom house or that he has a 29-year-old girlfriend. What shocked me is he makes $7 million a year. To put that in perspective, that's the kind of bread the backup catcher for the Yankees makes . . . The Columbus Blue Jackets are losing $12 million a season, according to numbers released by the Columbus Chamber. Only $12 million; isn't this what Gary Bettman calls a model NHL franchise? . . . When I got to my room at a Reading, Pa., hotel last weekend, the first thing I noticed was tissue jammed into the peep hole. I thought this is cool; I have the Erin Andrews suite. I took the tissue out and tossed it into the garbage. I figure if somebody wants to shoot nude video of me, well, go for it . . . Littlejohn, after Cleveland Cavaliers guard Delonte West drove his motorcycle while carrying two loaded handguns, a loaded shotgun and an 81/2-inch Bowie knife: "Man, talk about getting ready to drive the lane." . . . Currie, after the Toronto Raptors gave up 39 points in the fourth quarter at Memphis last weekend: "I'll skip the Grizzly details." . . . If I'm selecting the United States Olympic hockey team, the best Tim Thomas could hope for is the No. 3 spot behind Ryan Miller and Craig Anderson . . . I always thought Tim Lincecum pitched better on grass than turf.</p>
<p>In Philadelphia, I saw this really old bell sitting in a guarded room. I was surprised that nobody seemed to notice it had a crack in it. I wanted to be helpful and go to <span class="companylink">Home Depot</span> and ask for bell crack filler. "Aisle 14," I thought I would be told. "The crack filler is next to plumbing." . . . Currie, after Reuters reported mayhem erupted at a horse race in a Guatemalan town when riders and spectators drank copious amounts of home brew before race time, despite a months-old ban on drinking : "At least two riders fell off their horses during the annual Mayan Race. Dozens more fell off the wagon." . . . Hough, on the World Series television ratings being the highest they have been in years: "Makes sense, millions of Yankees fans all over the country and only a few hundred who could actually afford to see a game in person." . . . Toronto comedian Frenchie McFarlane, after the Calgary Flames got preferential treatment with the H1N1 shots: "The president of the club, Ken King, downplayed the scandal by stating: 'Now, that's what ya call a power play.' " . . . Rolfsen, after L.A. Clippers owner and real estate mogul Donald Sterling paid off a multi-million dollar legal settlement because his company discriminated against renting apartments to Hispanics, blacks and families with children: "Clippers fans wish he would put as much effort into draft preparation as tenant screening." . . . The last words go to Currie: "The Galactic Suite Space Resort, a company planning to open the first hotel in space, says it will accept paying guests in 2012. Word is Mark Cuban may be buying a suite. He wants to shorten his commute to Earth."</p>

<p>Question: The Ministry of Health has announced that H1N1 immunizations for the immuno-compromised will begin after Remembrance Day. Who qualifies as "immuno-compromised" ?</p>
<p>Answer: If you are immuno-compromised, it means your immune system's ability to fight infectious diseases is compromised or absent. Typically, transplant patients, people with HIV/AIDs, those receiving chemotherapy or dialysis are immuno-compromised, though there are hereditary conditions that also suppress the body's natural defences. If you are unsure if you fall within this at-risk population, speak to your health-care provider. Clinics for immuno-suppressed groups will begin later next week, depending upon the availability of vaccine, and may be located in clinic settings where these patients normally receive their medical treatments. Watch for clinic information posted to the Ministry of Health website, your regional health authority's website, or call Health Line at 1-877-800-0002.</p>

<p>Alberta government employees will be asked to swear oaths declaring they were sick if they miss work for an extended period due to the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Most employees were told this week they would need the legal declarations, sworn in front of a commissioner of oaths, if they are absent more than three consecutive days.</p>
<p>The policy is meant to ease the pressure on family doctors by removing the need for medical notes during the outbreak, said government spokesman Gerald Kastendieck.</p>
<p>"It's not something they need to do the minute they come back or anything," Kastendieck, who works in corporate human resources, said. "They can go to their HR person, say 'OK, I was away for however many days beyond the three, how do I get this addressed?' "</p>
<p>Kastendieck said most government agencies have commissioners of oaths working for them already, and no employees will be asked to pay to have their declaration done.</p>
<p>"The idea is not that your supervisor doesn't believe you or anything like that," he said.</p>
<p>Alberta's chief medical officer asked employers across the province to relax their rules on doctor's notes during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Some organizations, such as the University of Alberta, have already waived the requirement. Others, such as the Edmonton Public School Board, have relaxed their rules by expanding the number of days employees can be absent without a note.</p>

</p>
<p>The Council of the Federation, a group comprised of the premiers of Canada's provinces and territories, held a phone conference Friday to discuss the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>According to Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall, chair of the group, "the provinces wanted to be sure that our chief medical officers were co-operating, sharing best practices."</p>
<p>Wall would not, however, elaborate on the specifics of the discussion.</p>
<p>The concern, Wall said, was "how we can best deal with H1N1 right across the country. I think every single jurisdiction would admit that things could always be better."</p>
<p>Though each province has had a different approach to the pandemic, Wall hinted there "may be some common things that can be advanced vis-a-vis the federal government."</p>
<p>He refused to provide any details until further discussions could be held with Ottawa.</p>
<p>Vaccinations steadily rolling out</p>
<p>On Thursday, a total of 2,672 people received the H1N1 vaccination within the Saskatoon Health Region. This includes the Prairieland Park clinic, core neighbourhoods, the mobile Health Bus, rural populations and health region employees. That makes a total of 24,057 people who have been vaccinated as of Thursday in the health region since the campaign began.</p>
<p>Linda Walker, spokesperson for the Saskatoon Health Region, has a few tips for parents taking their kids to be immunized. To speed things up, she advises they fill out the consent form before arriving and make sure children are in short sleeves.</p>
<p>Walker said parents might want to bring something to entertain their children because today the health region is adding another group to the list of those available for immunization -- children in kindergarten to Grade 6 who have underlying medical conditions. Be prepared to wait, Walker said.</p>
<p>Despite the steady pace of vaccinations, area school boards are still reporting a number of schools with 10 per cent or more students absent with flu-like illness.</p>
<p>Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools reports seven schools out of 45 with 10 per cent or more of students absent as of Thursday, amounting to a total of 257 ill students. In the public school division, 30 schools out of 54 had 10 per cent or more students absent on Thursday. That number has been decreasing. On Nov. 3, it was at 37, and went down to 32 schools the next day. The public school board does not have a record of the total number of students absent with flu-like symptoms.</p>

</p>
<p>The Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations opened a temporary call centre in Saskatoon on Friday to deal with an increasing number of H1N1-related calls.</p>
<p>First Nations individuals, communities and organizations searching for information about the H1N1 vaccine were phoning a FSIN line that handles questions about non-insured health benefits, said Martin Paul, the FSIN's director of health research.</p>
<p>"They are coming from across Saskatchewan -- anywhere from First Nations clients to leadership encountering crises or potential crises and looking for contacts," Paul said. "Running out of the vaccine was something that affected everyone. So when they ran out, we had calls on when the next shipment would come out."</p>
<p>He said the dozens of weekly H1N1 inquiries now can be answered when people call the toll-free number: 1-866-956-6442.</p>
<p>"We have one person manning the phone with backup staff," Paul said. "This is our attempt to focus it to one line and play our part in answering all of those questions. We want to educate people because education is key to becoming empowered."</p>
<p>To address concerns about the safety and the effectiveness of the H1N1 vaccine, the call centre passes on basic information provided by the provincial medical health officer.</p>
<p>While callers will mainly be referred to the provincial HealthLine or to regional health authorities, information will be immediately available about the time and location of vaccination clinics and transportation arrangements to immunization clinics in the Saskatoon Health Region, Paul said.</p>
<p>The service is available during regular FSIN business hours: Monday to Thursday from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Friday from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, staffing has increased at HealthLine to handle the high volume of H1N1 calls.</p>
<p>Four non-nursing staff are now providing information about the location and times for flu clinics, said Fay Schuster, director of primary health services with the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>"That has relieved the pressure on the nursing side quite significantly," Schuster said.</p>
<p>She estimates the information specialists answer about 500 flu clinic calls a day between 7:30 a.m. and 9 p.m.</p>
<p>"We're finding there's still a large percentage of symptom-based calls," Schuster said.</p>
<p>Currently, five registered nurses take HealthLine calls during the day, six work on evenings and two are on nights.</p>
<p>"That's fluctuating if someone calls in sick but the region has offered our HealthLine nurses additional shifts if they're willing to come in," Schuster said. "On (Tuesday) we had seven nurses instead of six. Any time we can bring in extra nurses we do."</p>
<p>She added that at least two additional nurses will begin training in mid-November to answer HealthLine calls.</p>

<div>773 words</div><div>7 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>By all accounts, Saskatchewan's H1N1 vaccination program is ticking along much more smoothly than elsewhere in Canada, and surprisingly so, considering that the prevention could have been worse than the ailment.</p>
<p>Side-effects include restlessness, ennui, impatience, anxiety and, of course, the most common of all symptoms when Saskatchewanians are required to stand in line: disorientation.</p>
<p>We do not do queues well. Nor need we.</p>
<p>Waits are rare in this province, at least while upright on two feet, if not by name on surgery lists. "Land of No Lineups" was, in fact, my top suggestion for the new licence plate motto a few years ago, and I would have submitted it, too, but down at the government slogan office, the elevator was running slow and there was already this other dude in the lobby so I said to heck with it.</p>
<p>Space we have. Even with our growing population, we're still squeezed in only 1.7 people for every square kilometre of geography, the second-lowest provincial density next to Newfoundland and Labrador. One-point-seven people isn't enough human bodies to constitute a queue even if all 17/10ths of them participated, and that square kilometre itself is far too distant to holler for help.</p>
<p>"Yo, Murray!"</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Get yourself over here! I'm making me a lineup!"</p>
<p>"HUH?"</p>
<p>Huh? indeed.</p>
<p>Here is a little do-it-yourself social experiment that clearly demonstrates how abhorrent lineups are considered in Saskatchewan:</p>
<p>Head down the supermarket today and select an obvious Saskatchewanian at random, based on the criteria that it's game day, so he or she will be wearing green. Pick up whatever groceries you need and then position yourself in line immediately behind the Saskatchewanian. When she moves forward, you follow. It might take a few moments, but hold your order. Next time she advances, you do so as well. Repeat. Guaranteed, your subject will eventually turn around and tersely ask you, sir or madam (as the case may be), if there's some sort of problem.</p>
<p>See? Now make your way from the produce section to the check-out.</p>
<p>There you find Saskatchewanians stalled behind grocery carts, all cheerful, chatting with each another about football and the weather, or reading the magazine rack's latest details about Jen wanting Brad back -- any diversion to keep their minds off the fact that, against every instinct of their Prairie being, against their very provincial birthright, they are, omigawd, omigawd, waiting in line.</p>
<p>Psychologists have a name for our aversion to assembling one behind the other while nothing happens. It is called "macrophobia," similar to "acrophobia," a distaste for heights, and "barophobia," the heebie-jeebies for gravity -- afflictions that all fall under the broader category of "abnormal fears."</p>
<p>Abnormal, my foot. "Agoraphobia," fear of wide-open spaces -- now, that's whack.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan, when folks line for concert tickets, or for the big warehouse sale by gagagrapes or bababanana or whatever that inexplicably popular women's clothing store is called, the photograph of human beings assembled in single file makes for front-page news, which I'll bet never happens at the Calcutta Telegraph.</p>
<p>And I do hear you loud and clear. You're saying, "Ron, you devilishly good-looking moron. How can you say there are no lineups in Saskatchewan? I am stuck in one right now, have been for half an hour, for the <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> drive-through on south Albert."</p>
<p>First of all, I will thank you not to call me on my cell when you know full well that Milestone is long distance. Secondly, <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> has its headquarters in Oakville, Ont., part of Toronto. <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> cannot begin to appreciate our anxiety.</p>
<p>Returning to the point of this column, which I believe was the prevention of a pandemic on a scale the world has never before faced, let us further consider Toronto. While people in Saskatchewan seem generally content to let those highest at risk get their vaccinations first, and to wait in turn to be called, gladly avoiding lineups, already in Toronto there are charges of queue-jumping. Most outrageous was this week's word that several members of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club have had the H1N1 shot and are now immune, while the general public, still unprotected, risks contracting the powerful headaches, the overwhelming nausea and the repetitive vomiting associated with watching the Leafs play.</p>
<p>Healthy Leafs. Attempting hockey.</p>
<p>Shudder. If that's not testament to the superior vaccination plan in place here, what is?</p>

</p>
<p>Each week, Report on Business editors choose five stories that shouldn't be missed. Here are the 'must reads' for the week of Oct. 26, 2009.</p>
<p>The future of the supermarket</p>
<p>When you ask residents of Torino what to see in their elegant northern Italian city, they will steer you toward the Egyptian Museum and the Cathedral of St. John the Baptist, the keeper of the Shroud of Turin. And, they'll say, "You have to see Eataly." Eataly is a vast, new concept supermarket on the edge of central Torino, next to Fiat's headquarters. It is an unlikely blend of food bazaar, farm stand, educational centre, museum, eclectic dining experience and political and environmental movement - though one anchored firmly in the world of commerce. As a business, Eataly is a small monument to gastronomic anti-globalization, but one yearning for global exposure. Eric Reguly reports: Read the story</p>
<p>No business like flu business</p>
<p>While thousands of Canadians line up for H1N1 vaccinations and people around the world worry about the spread of the virus, the pandemic is proving to be a financial windfall for many big corporations. Last week, Clorox Co., best known for its bleaches and other household products, said sales of its disinfectant wipes are at all-time highs. Sales have been so strong the company's profit jumped 23 per cent in the third quarter to $157-million (U.S.). Clorox is one of many companies benefiting from the H1N1 pandemic. Last week, Kimberly-Clark Corp. said sales of its face masks jumped 40 per cent year over year during the third quarter, and 3M Co. said it sold $100-million worth of masks in the last quarter: Read the story</p>
<p>Golden sale heralds economic force</p>
<p>A surprise move to snap up $6.7-billion (U.S.) of gold underscores India's economic ascendance and marks the strongest indication yet that the central banks of Asia's fast-growing nations are turning away from the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency. The price of gold leapt to an all-time high as the decision to purchase 200 tonnes of gold from the International Monetary Fund highlighted the resilience of India's economy while laying bare a growing loss of global faith in the value of the U.S. dollar. Already the world's largest gold importer to fuel its massive jewellery consumption, the gold deal marks a major milestone for India and its standing in the global economy. Andy Hoffman reports: Read the story</p>
<p>Mountain Equipment Co-op raises cyclers' ire</p>
<p>Mountain Equipment Co-op, which has built its retailing reputation on a feel-good image of environmental and social responsibility, has ignited anger in an unlikely place – the bicycle industry. Its foray this month into bike selling has been criticized by rival specialty retailers for everything from unfair competition because of its tax-exempt status, to a Wal-Mart-style money grab, to unethical sourcing. Marina Strauss reports: Read the story</p>
<p>Wall Street insider trading probe widens</p>
<p>They spoke in code, on hard-to-trace prepaid cellphones. They adopted nicknames, like “The Greek.” And they made secret drops of bags of cash on busy Manhattan streets. U.S. prosecutors charged 14 people, including prominent Wall Street lawyers and traders, with conspiracy and fraud Thursday in a dramatic widening of an insider trading case that has already implicated top hedge fund managers and Silicon Valley executives. Embracing the tactics of mobsters and drug dealers, prosecutors said the sophisticated ring swapped advance knowledge of takeovers, including a 2007 buyout of Quebec drug maker Axcan Pharma Inc., to make quick multimillion-dollar gains.

<p>Kostitsyn, who was sent down to the AHL this season, will be in town with the Hamilton Bulldogs when they take on the Binghamton Senators at the Bell Centre. Tickets for the game cost $5 to $34.</p>
<p>In eight games with the Bulldogs, Kostitsyn has two goals and four assists and is plus-2. McGill University graduate Mathieu Darche leads the Bulldogs in scoring with 7-2-9 totals in 11 games.</p>
<p>The Bulldogs (7-0-1) are on an 11-game point streak, earning at least one point in every game this season.</p>
<p>Kitchener's injured Fanelli out of intensive care: Sixteen-year-old Kitchener Rangers defenceman Ben Fanelli was moved out of intensive care into a private room in Hamilton General Hospital yesterday. The Ontario Hockey League club said Fanelli's medical status of serious, but stable remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Fanelli was hit into the boards Friday by Michael Liambas of the Erie Otters and was airlifted to hospital with skull and facial fractures. The OHL suspended Liambas for the rest of the season, including playoffs, for the hit, ending the 20-year-old's junior career.</p>
<p>Bruins forward Krejci contracts H1N1 virus: The Boston Bruins confirmed forward David Krejci has been infected with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old centreman, who has recored one goal and four assists during 14 games this season, will be isolated from the rest of the NHL team for 24 hours or until he is symptom free.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quebec's promise: All by Christmas; 700,000 jabbed by last night; Storage requirements blamed for delay: 'We're not sacrificing quality for speed'</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>460 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>As hospital admissions and complications from swine flu jumped three fold across Canada this week, the provincial Health Department promised that anyone who wanted the flu shot could get it before Christmas.</p>
<p>About 700,000 Quebecers will have been vaccinated by yesterday evening, Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc said at a press conference.</p>
<p>So far, Quebec has received 1.3 million doses from the federal government.</p>
<p>That's better than Ontario, which only distributed 322,000 doses, Bolduc said.</p>
<p>The difference between the number of doses received and number distributed has to do with storage requirements, Bolduc said.</p>
<p>Because the vaccine has to be handled under specific conditions to conserve its potency - away from light and between 2 to 8 degrees C - distribution from the manufacturer to health agencies and then to vaccine sites takes a minimum of seven days and up to two weeks.</p>
<p>"We are not sacrificing quality for speed," Bolduc said.</p>
<p>To allay pandemic fears, Bolduc, flanked by Alain Poirier, Quebec's public health director, said the department will hold daily briefings to update the public on the provincial vaccine campaign as well as on the virus's progression.</p>
<p>The pandemic's relentless spread is putting pressure on the health system, Poirier said.</p>
<p>Complications from the virus has led to four deaths since August, the latest in the Outaouais area this week. The victim was a 67-year-old man with an underlying health condition.</p>
<p>At least 387 people have been hospitalized since the second wave began in the fall.</p>
<p>The hardest hit area so far has been the Montérégie.</p>
<p>At least 438 schools reported an absentee rate of more than 10 per cent related to swine flu this week, up from 291 schools last week.</p>
<p>Bolduc warned that Quebec's vaccine supply might be exhausted temporarily as of next week in some regions.</p>
<p>Vaccine production hit a snag when manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> switched from making the adjuvanted version of the vaccine with a booster substance, to making a special unadjuvanted batch for pregnant women.</p>
<p>When officials learned that Quebec would not be getting as much vaccine as initially promised, inoculation priorities changed to reflect shortages.</p>
<p>Vaccines are now limited to people who care for infants, children 6 months to 5 years old, expectant mothers more than 20 weeks pregnant, those with serious immune deficiencies, the gravely ill, front-line and health workers.</p>
<p>Poirier repeated an earlier plea for lower-risk Quebecers to be patient and wait a little longer for the vaccine, at least until those who are most vulnerable get their shots.</p>

<p>Pamela Berbrier's quest to have her twin daughters, who both suffer from Crohn's disease, vaccinated against the H1N1 virus has been riddled with horrors.</p>
<p>It started with a nurse at a CLSC telling her there was only one dose left and she would have to choose which 14-year-old would get it.</p>
<p>As Berbrier sat there and sobbed, another nurse came in, said that she could understand her pain as a mother, and vaccinated both Émilie and Danielle as well as Berbrier, who also suffers from severe Crohn's. But the ordeal didn't end there.</p>
<p>Berbrier, who lives in Montreal West, has spent every waking moment for the last four days trying to get the rest of the family - two young children and her husband - vaccinated as well to protect her teenage daughters.</p>
<p>Berbrier, even armed with a doctor's letter, has been turned away from several CLSCs.</p>
<p>Joann Heft, of Hampstead, has been in the same situation.</p>
<p>Her son, Michael Fefergrad, also has Crohn's, and she also hasn't been able to get the vaccine despite having a letter from the Montreal Children's Hospital.</p>
<p>Yesterday, both women took their letters and tried their luck at the newly-operating CSSS Cavendish, where their pleas finally fell on sympathetic ears. After much questioning and some tears, they got the vaccines.</p>
<p>Overall it hasn't been a good week for parents of children who take immunosuppressants, since that category was eliminated from the government's high-priority list because of a shortage of vaccination doses.</p>
<p>"I've been checking and suddenly immunosuppressed people are not on the list," said Mitchell Brownstein, who lives in Côte St. Luc. Both he and his 15-year-old son, Matthew, suffer from Crohn's disease and take immunosuppressants.</p>
<p>"I don't know where we can go to try to get it. It's really unfair - people with chronic illnesses are supposed to be a priority."</p>
<p>Virginia Champoux-Sokoloff also hit a brick wall. Her husband suffers from cystic fibrosis and finally got the vaccine on Wednesday, but despite her best efforts she hasn't been able to inoculate the rest of the family to further protect him.</p>
<p>Francine Dupuis, director of the CSSS Cavendish, said the centre's first day of vaccinations yesterday went well.</p>
<p>There were already 12 people waiting there at 5 a.m. She said she has only turned away about five per cent of people with chronic diseases and that those with doctor's letters are being evaluated on an individual basis.</p>

<p>My son, Daniel, who's three months shy of 3 years old, knew something was up yesterday morning when I started dressing him much earlier than usual.</p>
<p>"Are we going to the doctor?" he asked me.</p>
<p>"Yes, something like that," I responded.</p>
<p>And so my wife, Anita Wolkoff, who is more than 22 weeks pregnant, Daniel and I piled into our beat-up Sentra shortly after 8 a.m., hoping - perhaps "praying" is a better word - that we wouldn't have to wait too long in line at the CLSC René Cassin for my son's H1N1 vaccination.</p>
<p>Since April, when reports first emerged of a deadly new influenza virus in Mexico, I've been covering the H1N1 pandemic as a health reporter for The Gazette. Now I would no longer be an observer, but would have to queue up like everybody else.</p>
<p>As Day 1 of Montreal's massive public vaccination campaign began - a day earlier than scheduled - I was expecting the worst. Would nurses run out of flu shots? Would parents fight in line or argue with harried health-care staff?</p>
<p>We turned into the parking lot of the Cavendish Mall, which was already packed from end to end with cars, so I dropped Anita off at the entrance in search of a free spot. When I rushed inside just after 8:30 carrying Daniel in my arms, I saw a line of parents and their children that stretched the equivalent of three city blocks snaking through the mall.</p>
<p>A couple of police officers stood prominently near the vaccination clinic - which was actually an empty commercial space. Côte St. Luc's paramedics and mall security were also on hand.</p>
<p>Anita, who volunteers at the Catherine Booth Hospital, got vaccinated on Wednesday. She stood patiently in line, as did other mothers, some of them more pregnant than my wife and some holding bassinets with sleeping babies too young to get the shots.</p>
<p>"I want a lollipop," Daniel said, grabbing my hand.</p>
<p>We went off in search of candy, as the line began to inch forward. The vaccination staff were careful to divide the line into stations - where parents were asked questions and filled out forms - to keep things moving smoothly. Ironically, those parents or grandparents who showed up at 6 a.m. so that mothers and children would be the first to be inoculated were instead given coupons and told to come back at 11 a.m., while others who arrived an hour or two later got the shots sooner.</p>
<p>We were part of that lucky group. At around 10:40, two hours later, Daniel and I sat down next to a nurse.</p>
<p>"Is he left-handed or right-handed?" she asked me.</p>
<p>"Left-handed," I replied.</p>
<p>The nurse rolled up Daniel's right sleeve, told him to look in the other direction, and injected him in a blink.</p>
<p>"Ow!" Daniel said.</p>
<p>"If his arm starts to swell up, put a cold compress on it," she advised us.</p>
<p>The nurse gave Daniel some leftover Halloween candy, and off we went to the last station where we were told to wait for 15 minutes in case of a bad reaction. Children gathered around a TV watching Bambi.</p>
<p>"Ow!" my son said, pointing to his right arm as we left the vaccination clinic.</p>
<p>As we left the mall, we noticed that the line was a third as long. Now all we have to do is wait three weeks for Daniel's booster shot.</p>
<p>So that was it.</p>
<p>No pandemonium.</p>
<p>No cursing.</p>
<p>All the children and their moms got their shots.</p>

</p>
<p>A Montreal woman who is too frail to stand in line says she won't be getting the swine flu vaccine.</p>
<p>In remission from breast cancer, Ninon Lesage, 66, of Côte des Neiges says the drug she takes as part of her therapy causes her great fatigue.</p>
<p>"I am afraid I can't wait in line. And I am not the only one, I know of others who won't get it," Lesage said."What about the people who use a walker, or are diabetic or have had a stroke? This is nonsense."</p>
<p>Lineups and delays plagued some vaccine centres on the first day of the mass vaccine program yesterday.</p>
<p>Fueled by reports of deaths attributed to swine flu complications, the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic sparked massive school absenteeism, unprecedented overcrowding in emergency rooms, and blocked the Info-Santé line.</p>
<p>No one was answering the 811 help line for several hours yesterday. It had logged more than 8,600 calls, most about swine flu.</p>
<p>Snafus in the provincial vaccine program included confusion in Montreal's priority list, which seems to have no place for the moderately ill and elderly. In the Montérégie, this sub-group is second in line for the shot, to be vaccinated along with pregnant women.</p>
<p>Several seniors called The Gazette yesterday to complain that people like Lesage are in a "no man's zone" as far as the priority list of the Montreal Health and Social Services is concerned - they are not quite sick enough to be part of the first group to be vaccinated, but not healthy enough to wait, either.</p>
<p>From the outset of the pandemic planning, health officials had said that the over-65 group is not considered a high-risk group.</p>
<p>However a study appearing recently in the Journal of the American Medical Association found that when the elderly do get the virus, they are more at risk of dying, which suggests that doctors should be aware of risks to older patients who do become infected.</p>
<p>"It's hitting younger people. That's why the over-65 were not specifically targeted," said agency spokesperson Deborah Bonney.</p>
<p>Those in good health should wait until Dec. 7 while those with moderate conditions or who are less mobile should contact their physician or local health centre or CSSS to make vaccine arrangements, Bonney said.</p>
<p>"And if they are not mobile enough, then the CSSS should come up with an option," she added.</p>
<p>The health centre at St. Mary's Hospital told Lesage to wait in line with the others and suggested she call the media to complain.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Price snaps his 6-game losing skid; "Coach Martin sits Halak after goalie feels slight pull in his groin."</b>
</div><div>PAT HICKEY  </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>578 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette  </div>
</p>
<p>When Canadiens head coach Jacques Martin announced that Carey Price would start last night's game against the Bruins, he explained that he had a lot of confidence in the 22-year-old netminder.</p>
<p>But a few minutes later, he revealed that, while he has confidence in Price, the decision might have been based more on the fact Jaroslav</p>
<p>Halak "isn't 100 per cent."</p>
<p>Martin refused to elaborate on the state of Halak's health, but the speculation is the goaltender felt a slight pull in his groin. He did take part in the pregame skate and was well enough to dress as the backup.</p>
<p>While Price made his third straight start - and snapped a six-game personal losing streak with a 42-save performance in a 2-1 shootout win - there were some changes up front as Ryan White and Tom Pyatt made their NHL debuts. Pyatt centred the fourth line with Andrei Kostitsyn and White on his wings.</p>
<p>Pyatt and White were called up from the Hamilton Bulldogs on Wednesday night and Martin wasted no time getting them into the lineup. He said his main concern was to shore up a penalty-killing unit that had given up eight goals in the past five games.</p>
<p>The Bruins, who have the worst power play in the NHL, went 0-for-3 and it was interesting to note that Pyatt saw only limited action - one 16-second shift - on the PK and White saw none.</p>
<p>But the two newcomers did play a regular shift and White's debut was made more memorable when he picked up an assist on the first goal. White logged 12:08, while</p>
<p>Pyatt, who said he came to training camp with the idea that he didn't want to be known as a throw-in on the Christopher Higgins for Scott Gomez deal, played 11:27.</p>
<p>The callups are not good news for Kyle Chipchura, who was a healthy scratch along with Gregory Stewart. Chipchura is playing better, which proves that coaches see things differently and/or appearances can be deceiving.</p>
<p>Chipchura was a first-round draft choice in 2004, but he has struggled to establish himself in the NHL. He has started each of the past two seasons in Montreal, but has finished each season in Hamilton. He has no points in 13 games this season and is minus-8.</p>
<p>Flu fells Krejci: The Bruins announced that centre David Krejci has contracted the H1N1 virus and they recalled Mikko Lehtonen from Providence on an emergency basis, because they only had 11 healthy forwards.</p>
<p>While Krejci will probably return in a week, it's another blow to an offence that is already missing Milan Lucic and Marc Savard. Neither one of them is expected back before the end of November.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Canadiens want everyone to know that they won't be jumping the line to get flu vaccine for their players like those dastardly folks in Calgary and Toronto.</p>
<p>Donald Beauchamp, the team's vice-president in charge of communications, said the team will get in line with everyone else.</p>
<p>"The priority will be the players with young children or pregnant wives and the players will go to wherever they're told when it's their turn," Beauchamp said.</p>

<p>Created: Parking enforcement</p>
<p>It used to be that an overturned car in the Junction district of Toronto wouldn't be a big deal. But times have changed: cafes, gentrification, that sort of thing. And sure enough, when the (really strong) elves at Cossette installed an upside down 1989 Mercedes 190 in the parking lot this week behind IronKore, a new fitness centre emphasizing strength training, heads began to turn. The promotion, which is both bold and minimalist (the only clue to its origin is a sign behind the car which reads: “We Said No Parking – IronKore”) has apparently done the trick: IronKore says walk-in queries have increased. “You can think of this as classic product demonstration advertising,” Cossette (http://www.cossette.com/www/default.php[http://www.cossette.com/www/default.php]) co-chief creative officer Dave Douglass said in a statement. “Lifting cars is something that seems to come naturally to very strong people. Our goal was to highlight the strength training programs offered at our client's facility.” Does this mean Cossette didn't get the Mercedes account?</p>
<p>Noted: Making lemonade</p>
<p>Attention, out-of-work ad people: Here's your chance to grab victory (or at least a modicum of fame) from the jaws of adversity. When Erik Proulx lost his copywriting job at Arnold Worldwide last year, he decided to reinvent himself. His first project? Lemonade, (http://www.lemonademovie.com/[http://www.lemonademovie.com/]) a movie about creative people like himself who took their new-found unemployment as an opportunity to do something more fulfilling. In the film's trailer, one woman says she became a holistic health counsellor and yoga instructor. One man says he became a coffee roaster; one became an artist; and another changed his gender. Post-production on the doc is nearing completion, so now Mr. Proulx is putting together a companion book, and he's looking for stories of people who didn't make it into the film. You can visit his blog, Please Feed The Animals, (http://www.pleasefeedtheanimals.com/[http://www.pleasefeedtheanimals.com/]) for more information. But be careful: If you're not already unemployed, hearing the tales of reinvention and hope might make you wish you were.</p>
<p>Quoted: Harry Rosen's expensive lesson</p>
<p>“Oh my God, think of how much money we spent on this.” – Sandra Kennedy, Harry Rosen</p>
<p>A warning to companies: Don't rush into social media just because you've heard it's cool. Last spring, the upscale clothier Harry Rosen (http://www.harryrosen.com/?gclid=CM_U1-jp9J0CFSXyDAodUnP1Kw[http://www.harryrosen.com/?gclid=CM_U1-jp9J0CFSXyDAodUnP1Kw]) launched a campaign urging Canadian men during these difficult economic times to have confidence. Roger Martin of the Rotman School of Management, ad man Rob Guenette of Taxi, and Porter Airlines CEO Robert Deluce were drafted as models and enlisted to blog about their business successes. But during a forum on social media sponsored by Adobe this week, Harry Rosen's director of marketing, Sandra Kennedy, recalled that only about 1,000 people had visited the blog by the end of the campaign, making it an embarrassing and expensive flop. When so few readers materialized, Ms. Kennedy said the company scrambled to find ways to throw the content up onto Facebook and other online outlets. “The good news is, you do learn from those things,” she said. One thing we expect they've learned? That their customers are too busy running the world to stop and read blogs.</p>
<p>30-second spot: Immunity boaster</p>
<p>Bad news: breakfast cereals apparently don't cure cancer. Under pressure from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Kellogg is pledging to remove big, bold claims from boxes of Rice Krispies and Cocoa Krispies that the cereals help boost immunity. Parents and public health professionals said consumers could be misled into thinking the cereals could help fight H1N1. Last spring, Kellogg's had to pull ads that claimed Frosted Mini-Wheats improved the attentiveness of children by 20 per cent. Hey parents, do you know what really improves kids' health? Not feeding them sugary crap for breakfast.</p>
<p>Telecom smackdown</p>
<p>We love when companies take on each other in their advertising: It's the business world's version of WWE wrestling, except the body blows aren't (as) fake. South of the border, AT&T has been smarting over a Verizon campaign using maps to compare the two company's 3G coverage. The ad's tag line? “There's a map for that.” AT&T, which has exclusive rights to the iPhone, is now suing Verizon for false advertising. It seems to us that if AT&T spent as much effort on upgrading their oft-maligned network as they do on legal tussles, this never would have happened.</p>
<p>No accounting for taste</p>
<p>Speaking of marketing gone awry: The Down Under division of Kraft Foods recently hit a bad patch of yeasty brown sludge when it dared to fool with the national food Vegemite, blending it with cream cheese and holding a contest in which Aussies were able to vote on a name for the new concoction. The winner, Vegemite iSnack 2.0, wasn't a winner with the public, and the company was forced to hold another vote. The new winning name? Cheesybite (http://www.kraft.com.au/Products/Media_Release_Vegemite_Vote.htm[http://www.kraft.com.au/Products/Media_Release_Vegemite_Vote.htm]). That strikes us as fairly gross. Then again, we live in a country that adores something called poutine.</p>
<p>Taxi rises to the occasion</p>
<p>Congratulations to the folks at Taxi (http://www.taxi.ca/[http://www.taxi.ca/]) Toronto for winning a pair of gold statuettes at the London International Awards for their work on Pfizer Canada's Viagra account. The winning ads, a trio of 16-second TV and mobile spots (http://www.liaentries.com/winners/?id_medium=6&id_category=0&view=details&range=w&page=17&keyword=&medium=&category=&award=&country=&title_brand=&credits=&company_name=&city=&proceed_simple_search=false&proceed_advanced_search=false[http://www.liaentries.com/winners/?id_medium=6&id_category=0&view=details&range=w&page=17&keyword=&medium=&category=&award=&country=&title_brand=&credits=&company_name=&city=&proceed_simple_search=false&proceed_advanced_search=false]), each featured a 60-something fellow recounting how he and his wife had grown obsessed with a leisure activity. “Antiquing took over our lives,” says one of the men. “So I tried Viagra, and now my antiquing is pretty much gone.” The spots are wry, yet pointed, without being déclassé. If only we could say the same for every ad out there.</p>
<p>Client appreciation</p>
<p>Buy an ad, get out of town? This week Astral Media Radio announced it had paired up with Aeroplan to offer program points to clients who directly buy ads on one of Astral's 83 radio stations across the country. For its launch promotion, the companies are giving every Astral client who is registered with the program by next August a shot at winning 200,000 Aeroplan Miles. That might just be enough points to get you to some exotic location where you won't have to think about advertising, radio, or any kind of business at all.</p>

</div><div>Ken Warren   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen; with files from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>554 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has hit home for the Ottawa Senators organization.</p>
<p>Robin Lehner, the 18-year-old goaltender selected by the Senators in the second round of the 2009 NHL entry draft and now playing for the Soo Greyhounds of the Ontario Hockey League, has become the first confirmed OHL player diagnosed with H1N1.</p>
<p>"I'm not feeling well at all," Lehner told the Sault Star after a doctor confirmed he had the virus and a viral infection on Wednesday. "I just don't want to infect anyone else."</p>
<p>As a result, Lehner didn't accompany the Greyhounds on their three-game road trip, which began Thursday night in Windsor and continued on to Plymouth on Saturday and Saginaw on Sunday. His absence could have an impact on his chances to make the Swedish national junior team, as Swedish coach Pär Mårts is currently scouting teenage Swedish talent playing with Canadian major junior teams.</p>
<p>Lehner, who has posted a record of 5-5-1, a goals- against average of 2.82 and save percentage of .923 in 12 games for the Greyhounds, began feeling ill and had the chills on Tuesday, prompting him to visit a doctor on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We really just learned about that," Senators general manager Bryan Murray said during Thursday's game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. "We expect -- we know for a fact -- that the Soo organization will take care of our player. We wish him a speedy recovery and we will follow up with the Soo."</p>
<p>To date, no member of the Senators has been diagnosed with H1N1.</p>
<p>The OHL has taken extra steps this season to educate all teams on the risks of H1N1.</p>
<p>"From a league standpoint, we're giving more direction and educational resource material than ever before, given this is a more serious strain," vice-president Ted Baker said.</p>
<p>Moncton of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League has had to postpone three games after several players contracted the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>AHL 'helps' Winchester</p>
<p>It was an odd career step, but Jesse Winchester can't say enough about his two-week American Hockey League pit stop after a full NHL season in 2008-09.</p>
<p>"It helped a lot," said Winchester, who scored two goals and two assists in four games with Binghamton during his conditioning stint before returning to practice with the NHL Senators on Thursday. "I don't always play (in Ottawa) with as much confidence as I should. It was a real mental boost. Going forward, I'm going to take a lot from some of the things I did down there."</p>
<p>Winchester, who was a healthy scratch against the Tampa Bay Lightning on Thursday night, injured a knee during training camp. When he was healthy again, he jumped at the chance to play in the AHL for the first time -- he had originally gone directly from Colgate University to the NHL -- even though he wasn't sure what to expect.</p>
<p>With the AHL Senators, Winchester played on the power play, killed penalties and took a regular shift.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health minister says she's outraged that celebrity athletes got H1N1 vaccine</b>
</div><div>By Maria Babbage   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews vowed Thursday to investigate whether celebrity athletes jumped the queue for the H1N1 flu shot while other groups are being forced to wait as the province's supply dwindles.</p>
<p>She said she shares the outrage sparked by reports that professional hockey and basketball players in Toronto got the shot even though the province doesn't have enough yet to vaccinate school-age children.</p>
<p>"I don't care who you are, how rich you are, how famous you are," she said. "If you're not in the priority group, get out of the line and let the people who are in the priority groups get their vaccination."</p>
<p>Ontario is expected to run out of the H1N1 vaccine at the end of the week due to Ottawa's supply slowdown, she said.</p>
<p>The province has enough vaccine to immunize 2.2 million people, which is intended only for the estimated 3.4 million Ontarians who fall under the province's high-priority groups, she said.</p>
<p>They include pregnant women, children between six months and five years of age, people who care for infants and others who can't get the vaccine, people under age 65 with chronic conditions and those living in remote communities.</p>
<p>The government wants to add school-age children as a priority group, but doesn't have enough vaccine right now to expand that list, Matthews said.</p>
<p>She said she doesn't yet know how the pro athletes with the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Toronto Raptors got the shot, or whether it was obtained through Medcan, a private clinic that received 3,000 doses of the vaccine.</p>
<p>"All of our professional health-care providers - the ones who are administering the vaccine - are working under exactly the same rules," Matthews said.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if it was through a private clinic or through a doctor's office or through one of the public health unit clinics. The priority groups remain the same."</p>
<p>A health employee in Alberta was fired after letting the Calgary Flames jump the H1N1 flu shot queue, but the minister wouldn't say what the consequences might be in Ontario.</p>
<p>A review is needed, but not now when the province is focusing all its efforts into vaccinating the priority groups, said Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"While all professional athletes are considered high risk to exposure and transmission of the flu due to excessive contact with other players, heavy travel requirements and public exposure, only certain players and staff have received the H1N1 vaccine," Raptors spokesperson Jim LaBumbard said in an email.</p>
<p>A  sign Thursday notifies people the H1N1 vaccination clinic is full at the Kanata Recreation Complex, west of Ottawa. Pawel Dwulit, The Canadian Press    </p>

<p>VANCOUVER - The torch relay for the 2010 Paralympics will visit 11 communities starting next March. The relay will kick off in Ottawa on March 3 before it comes to a close in Vancouver on March 12. Games organizers say the Paralympic flame will stop off in Quebec City along the way, as well as another central Canada community that has not yet been named. The torch will arrive in B.C. on March 6 and will stop in the communities of Whistler and Victoria, among others. Vancouver organizing committee chief executive officer John Furlong says all Canadians should see the flame because it sheds light on the remarkable achievements of Paralympians. About 1,000 athletes from more than 40 countries will compete in the Paralympics, which run from March 12 to March 21.</p>

<p>Bruins say forward Krejci diagnosed with H1N1 flu</p>
<p>BOSTON - Boston Bruins centre David Krejci will stay away from the team for the next 3-5 days while he is quarantined with the H1N1 flu. General manager Peter Chiarelli said Thursday that the team's medical staff confirmed a diagnosis of the H1N1 virus that will keep the 23-year-old forward at home. The Bruins have told the rest of their players to continue to take precautions to avoid infection, including washing their hands frequently.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>From individual water bottles to sending kids home to recuperate. Sports teams in Guelph are doing what they have to do to minimize the chances of their athletes coming into contact with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We're doing everything we can," Guelph Storm equipment manager Russ Hammond said yesterday as the team prepared for three games this weekend starting Friday night at home against the Ottawa 67's.</p>
<p>"You know seven or eight years ago, if a player got the flu you'd just say ‘play and sweat it out. Sweat it out,' " Hammond said. "But things have changed. We didn't have H1N1 10 years ago."</p>
<p>Although several players have battled the flu in recent weeks, none has been diagnosed with H1N1. The team has taken several measures to hopefully keep it that way.</p>
<p>Shared water bottles are history, with each player now having his own numbered bottle. The team also takes its own water bottles on the road as opposed to the usual way of having opposing teams supply them.</p>
<p>"It's not putting your mouth on the bottle, it's putting your bare hand on shared bottles that can help spread germs," Hammond said.</p>
<p>There are no shared towels, hand sanitizer containers are spread around the dressing room Hammond wipes down the player's dressing room stalls every morning with disinfectant.</p>
<p>"My first task in the morning is to get the antibacterial wipes and completely wipe down the players' stalls before anyone even gets here," Hammond said.</p>
<p>Players are also being educated and reminded that the responsibility to take precautions is on their shoulders.</p>
<p>And unlike members of the Calgary Flames, Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors, Storm players did not jump the queue to get their H1N1 vaccination needles.</p>
<p>"We as a team are not a high risk priority," Storm coach/general manager Jason Brooks said.</p>
<p>"We as an organization realized there are members of the community who are at a higher risk than our team. We will wait until it is the appropriate time."</p>
<p>Sault Ste. Marie Greyhounds goaltender Robin Lehner was diagnosed with H1N1 this week, as was a member of the Moncton Wildcats of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League.</p>
<p>The Wildcats quarantined other players and had to postpone two games.</p>
<p>At the University of Guelph, several student athletes have been sent home with H1N1 symptoms, most recently a member of the Gryphons swim team.</p>
<p>"If we suspect on any team that there's a problem, we send the kids home," said director of athletics Tom Kendall.</p>
<p>He did not know the exact number, but said it was only "a handful."</p>
<p>The OUA has developed a H1N1 preparedness policy that schools follow. It includes everything from educating athletes to cancelling games if necessary.</p>
<p>"But we're not seeing a major problem with teams," Kendall said.</p>
<p>University of Guelph men's basketball coach Chris O'Rourke said his team has been ravaged by the regular flu and even a couple of cases of pneumonia.</p>
<p>"It's a fine line when you're dealing with athletes who want to be out there and who want to play," O'Rourke said.</p>
<p>"If they're sick you ask them not to come in, but are they feeling under the weather or feeling really sick?</p>
<p>"We just get them to a doctor and get them checked out."</p>
<p>Gryphon teams are also using plenty of hand sanitizer and separate water bottles and towels.</p>
<p>The Guelph Storm players' water bottles sit waiting rinkside at Thursday's practice. The team is no longer sharing water bottles or towels in light of H1N1. Tony Saxon, Guelph Mercury    </p>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO</p>
<p>Whether anyone will witness their feats of athleticism from the stands at University Stadium remains to be seen. But at least the Laurier Golden Hawks and Western Mustangs plan to be in attendance for Saturday's Ontario university football semifinal (The Score, 4:30 p.m.).</p>
<p>Both teams have battled flu-like symptoms recently, their coaches said during a teleconference Thursday, though there's not yet enough sickness to necessitate a change in game time.</p>
<p>Within the past couple days, the Ontario University Athletics conference has postponed games for the University of Waterloo women's hockey Warriors and for a volleyball team at Lakehead University due to confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>While the flu pandemic takes its toll on the general population, including both football teams, the coaches reported it's business as usual for Saturday's semifinal contestants.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of our kids who are sick," said Laurier head coach Gary Jeffries, whose Hawks missed up to eight players at a practice earlier in the week because of flu-like symptoms. "Do they all have it? Possibly."</p>
<p>"I think it's probably the same in our program as everywhere else. Everybody is dealing with it to a certain degree. We'll just have to wait and see on Saturday."</p>
<p>Jeffries said two of his assistant coaches missed team practices this week due to illness.</p>
<p>The Western Mustangs appear to have been through the worst of it.</p>
<p>"We are pretty healthy right now. We went through it about mid-season where we had a lot of players sick. Not diagnosed. But we kept them away," said Mustangs boss Greg Marshall.</p>
<p>"There haven't been a lot of kids or coaches missing practice this week."</p>
<p>Teams throughout the OUA have said they continue to pay close attention to their respective campus guidelines on flu prevention, such as the elimination of shared water bottles and towels, and making plenty of hand sanitizer available to student-athletes.</p>
<p>But those measures can seem as futile as keeping the ocean back with broom.</p>
<p>"In close quarters, like a football dressing room, it's difficult," Marshall acknowledged.</p>
<p>Pro sports teams like the Toronto Maple Leafs and Calgary Flames made headlines this week when they reportedly jumped the queue for H1N1 vaccines, which were intended for high-risk persons.</p>
<p>A spokesperson in WLU's athletics department said no student-athletes were given special preference in receiving the H1N1 vaccine at campus clinics.</p>
<p>Younger people, including student-athletes, are said to be among those groups most affected by H1N1.</p>

</div><div>Dr. Gifford-Jones   </div>

</p>
<p>Have you heard of the Golden Poo Award?</p>
<p>It's not as prestigious as the Nobel Prize but now that the virus season is here, it's time to think about influenza and the H1N1 virus. And remember there's more to infection than these two diseases. That's why this award was recently presented to contestants who made outstanding contributions to hygiene and sanitation.</p>
<p>But can you guess what winners of this peculiar contest won?</p>
<p>The award, sponsored by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, had one main message: People often don't wash their hands after using the toilet. The goal of the contest was to find motivation for them to do so.</p>
<p>The school had good reason to reach its unappetizing conclusion. It reported a recent survey during which public washroom sinks were outfitted with sensors. It then monitored 250,000 people who used the facilities. This revealed that only 28 per cent of men washed their hands after zipping up their trousers. Women had only a slightly better track record.</p>
<p>So what did the winning contestant propose in an effort to improve hygiene? In the women's washroom a LED screen was inscribed with the question, "Is the person next to you washing with soap?"</p>
<p>In the men's washroom the message went right to the jugular, "Soap it off or eat it later." This motivated more men to scrub at the sink. Clever cartoon films also got the hand washing message across to young children.</p>
<p>Dr. Val Curtis, director of hygiene at the school, said that "We need to talk more about poo. It shouldn't be a taboo subject. Poor hygiene kills 5,000 children every day."</p>
<p>The importance of hand washing was proved to be life-saving 150 years ago by Dr. Semmelweiss in Vienna. He observed that one in six women died of infection following childbirth. He decided it was because doctors, following autopsies, often delivered babies without washing their hands. Once hand washing was adopted, the maternal death rate dropped.</p>
<p>So how bad is hygiene in North America? Experts say that only 40 per cent of hospital workers wash their hands. That's why each year an estimated 200,000 Canadians develop hospital infections and 8,000 die.</p>
<p>A few years ago the New Orleans Health Department stationed medical student spies in washrooms during a meeting of infectious disease specialists. The shocking conclusion was that of 500 doctors using these facilities, only 69 per cent washed their hands.</p>
<p>It's amazing how careless some people are about hand hygiene. How many times have you seen a person blow his or her nose, then offer to shake your hand? Or a friend who puts ice in your drink after running his hand down Fido's tail. For all I know Fido may have just pooped, and I know what I'll be drinking.</p>
<p>Experts in the field stress that hand washing is the most important habit to prevent the spread of disease-causing germs. Often we hear people say, "I have a cold so I won't kiss you." But then they proceed to shake your hand. The best solution would be to follow the Japanese, and just bow.</p>
<p>As seasonal influenza and H1N1 viruses now spread across the country, there is debate about the wisdom of taking these vaccines, particularly H1N1. But there should be no debate about hand washing.</p>
<p>I'll be washing my hands with Trisan, an antimicrobial cleanser. This agent is effective against several micro-organisms while also cleansing and moisturizing the skin.</p>
<p>So how much money did contest winners receive?</p>
<p>The London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine pooh-poohed the idea that money motivated contestants. Instead it created a golden statue. But it was a statuette of poo.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hage emerges in two categories for league's top awards</b>
</div><div>Drew Edwards  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>857 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>SP03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>During the past few seasons, finding worthy Ticat candidates to nominate for the league's Most Outstanding Player awards could be charitably described as a bit of a struggle.</p>
<p>Not this season: The in-house competition was so strong that the Canadian Football League's leading tackler wasn't even nominated as the Most Outstanding Defensive Player on his own team.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the league announced the team nominees for the 2009 Gibson's Finest CFL Player Awards. The players were selected by local members of the Football Reporters of Canada and the CFL head coaches, though Ticat head coach Marcel Bellefeuille said he didn't receive a notice from the league and therefore didn't vote.</p>
<p>The Ticat winners were:</p>
<p>Most Outstanding Player: Arland Bruce III</p>
<p>Most Outstanding Canadian Player: Marwan Hage</p>
<p>Most Outstanding Defensive Player: Markeith Knowlton</p>
<p>Most Outstanding Special Teams Player: Dylan Barker</p>
<p>Most Outstanding Rookie: Marquay McDaniel</p>
<p>Most Outstanding Offensive Lineman: Marwan Hage</p>
<p>Hage has been honoured for his work in the trenches three times.</p>
<p>"It's always good to get recognized but I'm just a reflection of my offensive line -- it's the guys around me that make me good or bad. But I'm happy. There's a lot of good players on this team."</p>
<p>Bellefeuille chuckled at the fact that the league's leading tackler, Jamall Johnson, couldn't get the nod over teammate Markeith Knowlton, who's made a number of big plays this season.</p>
<p>"I think you could have picked any of our three linebackers and it would have been a good choice for the defensive player award," Bellefeuille said. "It was a little tougher this year to make those decisions."</p>
<p>A second round of balloting involving local and national media will select the East and West Division nominees, to be announced Nov. 12. League winners will be announced Nov. 26</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>The Cats have suspended offensive lineman Matt Morencie, just two days after signing him to a contract. But don't worry, it's all part of GM Bob O'Billovich's plan.</p>
<p>"We're going to suspend him so he can finish his courses at the University of Windsor and this allows us to retain his rights. We still expect him to be a good candidate for training camp next year," said O'Billovich yesterday.</p>
<p>Morencie was drafted in the third round by the B.C. Lions, but went back to the University of Windsor to play his senior year. With his season over, Morencie was technically a free agent under league guidelines.</p>
<p>There is, however, an unwritten rule that teams won't sign a player drafted by another club who returns to the CIS. O'Billovich was angered when Montreal signed receiver Mike Giffin under similar circumstances last year.</p>
<p>But O'Billovich said he hasn't heard from B.C. GM -- and good friend -- Wally Buono.</p>
<p>"I haven't heard from Wally. Maybe when he sees the wire today he'll give me a call. But he knows the rules as well as I do," Obie said.</p>
<p>With the addition of Morencie, the Ticats have three players on the roster who were ranked in the top six by the CFL scouting bureau before the 2009 Canadian Draft -- Simeon Rottier and Matt Carter are the others.</p>
<p>"That's good management," said O'Billovich with a laugh while watching practice at Ivor Wynne yesterday. "You can't ever have enough of these guys. If you have enough good Canadians, that just gives you lots of good options."</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Things continued to improve on the injury front for the Ticats as safety Sandy Beveridge returned to practice yesterday.</p>
<p>Defensive co-ordinator Greg Marshall said he isn't sure whether Beveridge or second-year man Dylan Barker will get the start.</p>
<p>"Our plan is to get both guys ready and go with the guy that gives us the best chance to make plays," Marshall said. "I don't like to see a guy lose his job because of injury but we have to see if Sandy can function and do the things he needs to do."</p>
<p>Linebacker Dennis Haley missed practice for the second straight day with the flu.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>While other professional sports teams may be jumping the queue to get H1N1 vaccinations, the Ticats are waiting in line like everybody else.</p>
<p>"There isn't a team program. Right now, it's still just at-risk people and we're not in that category right now," Bellefeuille said. "We're trying to use prevention."</p>
<p>The team has given the players information packages and held an education session on how to decrease your chances of getting sick.</p>

<p>New Elvis Single</p>
<p>Two-time Olympic silver medallist Elvis Stojko released the first single from his new album yesterday, titled Let Me Be The One.</p>
<p>The album by the seven-time Canadian figure skating champion, titled 100 Lifetimes, will be released later this fall.</p>
<p>A statement from Stojko's agent says the album represents "several years of work in the studio."</p>
<p>Stojko's father was a professionally trained tenor and the release of 100 Lifetimes marks the start of the skater's music career.</p>
<p>The songs will be featured as part of a musical figure skating show titled Rock the Ice to be held Jan. 3 in Peterborough.</p>

<p>But Amanda Rodrigues won't be getting the $150,000 advance she was seeking from the boxer's estate, and it's not clear whether she'll get to keep their dog.</p>
<p>Superior Court Justice Paul Chaput rendered his decision yesterday in Montreal.</p>
<p>Rodrigues, 23, is in a heated legal battle with Gatti's family over his estimated $6-million estate.</p>
<p>Gatti was found dead under mysterious circumstances at a posh Brazillian seaside resort last July 11.</p>
<p>Brazillian police initially ruled the death a homicide and Rodrigues was detained for a few weeks. Police then changed their tune and ruled the death a suicide.</p>
<p>Bruin Has H1N1</p>
<p>Boston Bruins forward David Krejci has been diagnosed with H1N1 and is being isolated from his teammates, the NHL club said Thursday.</p>
<p>He joins a handful of players around the league to contract the virus.</p>
<p>Krejci won't rejoin the Bruins until he is symptom and fever free for 24 hours, the team said, adding it is following Center for Disease Control recommendations.</p>
<p>Will Renault Return?</p>
<p>Renault CEO Carlos Ghosn says the automaker will announce whether it will stay in Formula One racing before the year ends. Asked Thursday if Renault plans to pull out of the sport, he said the company will announce its "strategy in terms of Renault's role in Formula One" before 2010.</p>
<p>Renault's reputation was damaged by a crash scandal that led to team principal Flavio Briatore's indefinite ban from the sport. Briatore ordered former driver Nelson Piquet Jr. to crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix to improve teammate Fernando Alonso's chances of victory.</p>

<p>Pandemic H1N1 influenza is now in virtually every country in the world, and health officials are bracing for an upsurge in cases as winter sets in, World Health Organization officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>"At WHO, we remain concerned about the pattern we are seeing, particularly because a sizable number of people do develop serious complications and death," Dr. Keiji Fukuda, a special adviser to the WHO director-general on pandemic influenza, said at a news conference. "We anticipate seeing continued or increased activity during the winter period in the Northern Hemisphere."</p>
<p>The most recent figures available show that at least 5,700 people worldwide have died from swine flu, with 4,175 of those in the Americas.</p>
<p>Vaccinations against swine flu have started in 20 countries and millions of doses have been delivered safely with no adverse events, said Fukuda.</p>
<p>He complained, however, that the agency had yet to receive most of the 200 million doses of vaccine that were to be donated by 11 countries. Delays in production of the vaccine have led to shortages.</p>
<p>In other flu news:</p>
<p>* Swine flu has struck the remote Yanomami tribe in Venezuela, showing no one is safe from the virus. Seven people have died from the flu out of a population of 28,000.</p>
<p>* Cold weather has brought an outbreak of swine flu in Mongolia, and the country has been requesting additional doses of the antiviral drug Tamiflu to combat its spread. The country has confirmed 859 cases of swine flu and six deaths.</p>
<p>* In an effort to ease the burden on its health-care system, Norway has decided to allow sale of Tamiflu without prescription.</p>
<p>* An intense outbreak is occurring in Ukraine, with 500,000 cases of acute respiratory distress and 85 deaths. Both WHO and European officials have been sending in teams to help out.</p>
<p>* Recent news reports have said that at least 13 major companies, including Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan Chase, have received allocations of swine flu vaccine. Critics charge that the companies are getting favourable treatment.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Not much is more certain to blow a government off course than events. First observed by former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan, that old axiom is Stephen Harper's new reality.</p>
<p>Days ago, Conservatives had a breeze at their back. Now they're twisting in winds they can't control.</p>
<p>First there were those big, blue, bogus stimulus cheques and then came the swine flu with its viral mix of fear, confusion and queue jumping. Now watchdogs are barking at too-sunny economic forecast and who-cares crisis readiness.</p>
<p>Each alone would be a problem for any government. Together they threaten the trend Conservatives count on to transform their current minority into a future majority.</p>
<p>Given the violence of political pendulum swings, Harper could still grasp his Holy Grail. Liberals remain in disarray and 2010, beginning with the Olympics and continuing through an unusually long list of events that flatter prime ministers, is particularly promising.</p>
<p>But it's also true that the cornerstone of Conservative success is suddenly stressed and in danger of cracking. Canadians who decided that the ruling party is competent to manage the nation's affairs now have worrying personal reasons to reconsider that assumption.</p>
<p>Their conclusion always made too light of the weight of available evidence. Inadequate as the government's immunization plan is now proving, its financial stewardship has long been inept. Along with missing an imminent recession and hiding inevitable deficits, the faux-economist Harper gnawed through an inherited $13 billion surplus with politically charged tax cuts and runaway spending.</p>
<p>Canadians already concerned about family health will soon be paying the price for those financial mistakes. Kevin Page, the federal budget officer Conservatives put in place and are now trying to silence, is contradicting the Conservative claim that the return of good times will rescue the country from long-term structural deficits. If Page is prescient -- and his gold standard work to date only inspires confidence -- Harper will have to break his word not to raise taxes or cut services to balance Ottawa's books.</p>
<p>Page isn't alone in finding fault. A single thread weaves through Auditor General Sheila Fraser's Tuesday reports on the government's performance. From preparing for emergencies to guarding against abuse of foreign workers to delivering foreign aid, Conservatives boast a better game than they play.</p>
<p>That criticism is hardly unique: Fraser became a national icon, as well as a local voice of sanity, by showing no fear or favour in her eviscerations. But her latest deconstructions are a direct challenge to the carefully crafted illusion that Conservatives are delivering the better government they promised.</p>
<p>Strip that illusion away and what's mostly left is a highly-secretive, hyperpartisan administration benefitting by favourable comparison to a fractured opposition that has yet to convince voters it could do any better. A similar dynamic helped Liberals form four successive governments, a string of victories broken only when citizens, taxpayers and voters lost trust in the party's ethics and competence.</p>
<p>Conservatives haven't yet reached that tipping point. Their ability to fashion broad support from narrow interests is unmatched, as is the positive perception of the Prime Minister's leadership.</p>
<p>But events that blow governments off course also expose frailties. Winds that once filled Harper's sails are now in his face, slowing momentum and whipping doubt into dust devils.</p>

<div>660 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Last week, when The Spec asked how many people had tested positive for H1N1, Hamilton public health refused to release the information.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>The out-of-the-gate explanation from Dr. Chris Mackie, associate medical officer of health, was troubling to say the least.</p>
<p>"Because," Mackie told the reporter, "public health doesn't want to generate any more fear than there already is, especially if there isn't enough vaccine to give to everybody."</p>
<p>The overt paternalism in that statement gives shockingly short shrift to the public's basic right to know.</p>
<p>It also harkens back to the dark days of 2006 when public health wilfully sat on information about a legionella outbreak.</p>
<p>Mackie's comment followed a number of e-mail exchanges with the reporter in which he first held out the prospect of providing the data if a shipment of vaccine arrived.</p>
<p>When a supply came in later that day, the reporter again asked for the lab results.</p>
<p>Mackie said he would send it when they had confirmation of a third shipment, if he was authorized by Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, Hamilton's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>That never happened.</p>
<p>The linking of the lab results to the supply of vaccine clearly suggests someone was feeling a patronizing need to protect the public from itself. Underscoring that point is the embarrassing fact that The Spec ultimately got the results from Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's regional medical officer of health.</p>
<p>The information shared by Halton showed positive H1N1 tests had doubled in a week.</p>
<p>Guess what? It didn't scare people spitless or create a crisis of confidence. It was just one more piece of relevant information in a flood of flu stories.</p>
<p>I asked Richardson, Mackie's boss, why her people refused to release the test results.</p>
<p>Richardson said there was no attempt to hide anything, that her department has been a model of transparency and communication throughout the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>But, in this case, Richardson said, they wanted to make sure the information about positivity rates was accurate because of misinformation that had appeared in a CBC story.</p>
<p>"There's no motivation by us whatsoever to look at issues of fear and that sort of thing," said Richardson. "It's to get accurate information out there so people can understand what's going on."</p>
<p>To be fair to Mackie, he did make reference to wanting to check the lab results, though he hardly elaborated on it.</p>
<p>But neither that nor Richardson's disavowal negates his comment about tamping down fear or linking the release to whether or not there was an adequate supply of vaccine.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mackie said by e-mail that they wanted to make sure the data was accurate before sharing it because they were seeing positive test levels never seen before.</p>
<p>Couple of things.</p>
<p>First, the week before they were also seeing levels never seen before and that didn't stop them from releasing the results.</p>
<p>Second, the numbers provided by Halton were in fact accurate. That was proven this week when Hamilton finally released the info.</p>
<p>Frankly, it's hard to know if this is a case of internal miscommunication, trying to control the message or, perhaps, an indication the hard-won lessons from the legionella fiasco still haven't been completely absorbed.</p>
<p>I do know this. When I called to speak to Richardson, I was told by the department's communications officer she didn't know if Richardson would get back to me that day or not.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>"It's late in the day for our office," she said.</p>
<p>It was only three in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Richardson did call, as she normally does. But how can you not question their lines of communication in light of an attitude like that?</p>

<p>Re: 'It's no time to encourage misinformation' (Letters, Nov. 3)</p>
<p>There needs to be a balance. Each person has the right to make an informed choice about getting the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Susan Clairmont's column was not an attack or a must-do. It offered an alternate approach, a balance to the headline articles and media reports.</p>
<p>There's no question our hearts break for those who have lost family and friends to H1N1. There's no question we should take care, wash our hands, eat well and follow other common sense protocol for good health.</p>
<p>Let's put aside fear and blame. Then, with honour for others' choices, let's make the decision that is right for each of us.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>I teach part-time at Lakehead University's Orillia campus and so decided to obtain my flu shot there after failing in the greater Hamilton area.</p>
<p>I was able to get my shot in one hour, including the 15-minute post-shot wait period. Why? Because the Simcoe-Muskoka health authority had the wisdom to hand out appointment block sheets to patients so the young and infirm did not have to wait in the poor weather for hours on end.</p>
<p>The system isn't perfect, but it certainly reduced wait times, made people less impatient and panicky, and allowed the police to be where they were truly needed instead of supervising large crowds of disgruntled patients.</p>
<p>I congratulate the Orillia health authority for recognizing the flaws of the original plan (expecting hundreds of people to assemble with little or no information) and for doing something about it immediately (the creation of an appointment system). Yes, Orillia is a much smaller community than Hamilton. Nevertheless, Hamilton could certainly minimize patient suffering and fatigue by looking at the Orillia model.</p>

</p>
<p>Older people may be the next group in line for the H1N1 flu shot at local vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Provincial health officials want to add school-aged children as a priority group to receive the flu shot once enough vaccines are available.</p>
<p>However, given the virus's local impact, Hamilton may opt to vaccinate older people with underlying illnesses first, said Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"School kids are one potential target," he said. "There's also been deaths reported in the elderly, so that's a potential target, as well. Especially the elderly with chronic disease."</p>
<p>Though people over the age of 65 are less likely than younger groups to become infected with H1N1, they have a greater chance of dying from the virus.</p>
<p>Three women with H1N1 influenza, all over 50 and all with chronic illnesses, died in Hamilton hospitals during the past week. A woman in her 70s, also with an underlying illness, was the first person in Halton Region to die of the flu.</p>
<p>"There needs to be some decision-making at the local level, everyone realizes that," said Mackie. "Right now, it's a negotiation of how much."</p>
<p>Though schools have been hard hit with H1N1 outbreaks, there have been few cases of severe illness in healthy children.</p>
<p>"That's very reassuring, but it means that vaccinating that population may not be as important at this stage," Mackie said.</p>
<p>"It may be that there's a lot of natural immunity acquired through infection."</p>
<p>For the most part, Ontario's public health units are free to tailor their flu shot campaigns to the needs of their individual communities. However, Dr. Arlene King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, has directed all 36 health units to restrict vaccination clinics to high-priority groups.</p>
<p>Those groups include pregnant women, children between six months and five years of age, people who care for infants, people under the age of 65 with chronic conditions and those living in remote communities.</p>
<p>Despite a shortage of the flu shot, Ontario health officials say they are still aiming to have vaccinated 2.2 million people by the end of this week. All the vaccine is being distributed.</p>
<p>"There's nothing sitting in Ontario," said King. "Everything is either moving or going into people's arms at this point."</p>
<p>Hamilton has distributed 24,500 doses to family doctors, 12,000 to hospitals and more than 22,000 doses through public clinics.</p>
<p>Both Halton Region and Hamilton now have doses of the unadjuvanted vaccine for pregnant women. In Halton, the doses are available through family doctors and the vaccination clinic at the Halton Regional Centre in Oakville. Hamilton has also made the doses available through its clinics.</p>
<p>An effort to crack down on those jumping the queue to get their flu shots ahead of high-priority groups has made an impact in both Hamilton and Halton, officials say.</p>
<p>Demand for the vaccine in Hamilton clinics declined dramatically this week, a sign people were respecting the plea to reserve the shot for priority groups, Mackie said.</p>
<p>"People truly are respecting this now," said Dr. Bob Nosal, Halton's medical officer of health. "Some may not be agreeing with it but they are respecting the decision."</p>

<p>Vancouver Canucks winger Steve Bernier has flu-like symptoms and has been isolated from teammates, but the National Hockey League team doesn't yet know if it is a case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Bernier, absent from the Canucks' morning skate ahead of Thursday's game against the Minnesota Wild, has been given his own hotel room and will return to Vancouver on Friday, general manager Mike Gillis said.</p>

<p>Auditor-general Sheila Fraser couldn't have picked a better time to release her report on the federal government's failure to adopt an emergency-response plan.</p>
<p>The chaotic roll-out of the H1N1 vaccine has been front-page news for days. The sight of line-ups of pregnant women, babies and the elderly fueled anxiety and anger among many Canadians in equal measure.</p>
<p>With half of all N1H1 vaccine doses marooned in storage while various levels of government blame each other, did we even need Fraser's report to know that Canada can't handle an emergency? There is no flu epidemic; people are just nervous. And the response is still catastrophically disorganized.</p>
<p>Fraser puts the blame squarely on the shoulders of the federal government. Public Safety Canada's emergency response plan has yet to be endorsed by the government or the federal departments that are supposed to work with it.</p>
<p>The result is that the body whose job is to co-ordinate federal departments, provinces and territories in the event of a major disaster lacks the authority to carry out its job.</p>
<p>Fraser said she could find no reason why the emergency response plan, in the works since Public Safety was created in 2003, has not been approved six years later. But even without formal approval, the public-safety department could have done more to help prepare the country for an emergency, Fraser said.</p>
<p>Elementary measures have not been taken: The department has not identified how much food, water and energy supplies or medical services would be needed in an emergency. It has not helped put in place a system that would allow police, firefighters and other first responders to communicate with each other across the country. There are no standards for compatible radios. No plan is in place to protect the electrical grid or cyberspace from attack.</p>
<p>Nor is there any sense of urgency about fixing these problems. Fraser reported that for the past two years the sub-department responsible for emergency management has not spent a third of its budget. With a budget of $58.5 million, there was enough money to get started on resolving the problem of incompatible radios.</p>
<p>If there's one thing the disorganization around the H1N1 flu vaccine has made clear, it's the need for a federal body empowered to lead a co-ordinated, centralized response to national emergencies.</p>

<p>Anyone who wants an H1N1 flu shot will get it by Christmas, Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc promised yesterday. About 700,000 Quebecers have been vaccinated so far, he said at a press conference.</p>
<p>Charlie Fidelman also reports that lineups and delays plagued some vaccine centres yesterday, the first day of the mass vaccine program. Snafus included confusion in Montreal's priority list, which seems to have no place for the moderately ill and elderly. Seniors complain that some of their peers are in a "no man's zone."</p>
<p>Gazette health reporter Aaron Derfel and his wife took son Daniel, just shy of 3 years old, to Cavendish Mall for the child's vaccination. The shopping centre, known as the Schmall, probably hasn't seen as many people since the 1970s, Derfel notes.</p>
<p>Karen Seidman writes that it has been a rough week for parents of children who take immunosuppressants - the category is no longer high priority.</p>
<p>Reports surfaced yesterday that some members and staff of the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors had received shots. Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews was curt: "I don't care who you are, how rich you are, how famous you are. If you're not in the priority group, get out of line."</p>

<p>I accepted that the Calgary Flames management and players were not at fault for getting preferential H1N1 vaccinations. However, those Flames players and management people can now do the right thing to repay their community by making a generous donation for each flu shot they received-- say $10,000 per shot. Let's assume that they received 150 shots, that's only a donation of $1.5 million-- an amount they can easily afford. The donation could go to buy H1N1 vaccine so that our police officers and firefighters could get vaccinated immediately.</p>

<p>They tell us to be afraid, to run and get vaccinated. Oops, they don't have enough vaccine. Come back--maybe next week; don't be angry.</p>
<p>The government has known for six months that H1N1 would probably re-emerge this fall with a vengeance. It knew the supply of the vaccine would probably be an issue. It know who the high-risk groups are.</p>

<p>The Flames jumped the queue and got their flu shots at a private clinic. It is not their fault. They were offered the shot and they took it.</p>
<p>The health official who lost his job over it has been made a scapegoat.</p>
<p>The entire H1N1 campaign has been flawed from the start. The responsibility lies with Ron Liepert.</p>
<p>The Flames got the vaccine, but so did thousands of others last week who didn't qualify as high risk. The only difference is they had to stand in line for hours to get it.</p>
<p>Many doctors and nurses still haven't had the shot. They are frontline workers--the people we will rely on when we get sick.</p>
<p>Liepert should either resign or be fired. Ultimately, this mess is his responsibility.</p>

<p>So, the Calgary Flames jumped the line and were vaccinated before "high-risk" Albertans. While I believe that children, pregnant women, and people with health conditions should be a priority, I do not think it was prudent to fire the senior medical staff member who administered the vaccine to the Flames.</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic has reached a fever pitch and people are panicking about contracting the virus and getting vaccinated, which is why they called for blood and this individual was fired.</p>
<p>The immunizations have been mishandled from the start, and the only ones who should be held accountable are those at the top of Alberta Health. They created the panic.</p>

<p>The Flames' H1N1 vaccination should come as no surprise. The province has allowed private clinics to operate for some time.</p>
<p>Private clinics should be provided with flu vaccine at the same times and under the same conditions as public clinics.</p>
<p>The Flames received their shots at a time when anyone could get them. So the problem it isn't the way things have been handled, it is how the system was allowed to expand in the first place to allow private clinics.</p>

<p>In the wake of the H1N1 vaccination fiasco, the time for complaining is over. It is now time to gain the clarification Albertans' have been missing and move forward.</p>
<p>Several articles in the Nov. 5 edition of The Journal contained useful information to help reduce the public's confusion, and in many cases panic, about the virus and the vaccine.</p>
<p>Of particular note was clarification of the definitions of "pandemic" and "high risk." Pandemic refers to the proportion of the population infected by the virus across a large region, not the severity or deadliness of the virus. And high risk in this instance relates to the likelihood of suffering severe complications or death from the virus, not the likelihood of catching it. These are important distinctions.</p>
<p>For instance, the Calgary Flames are at high risk for contracting H1N1, but it's unlikely they are at high risk for severe complications or death.</p>
<p>Few people would call the vaccine program well-organized or a success. The provincial government and Alberta Health Services screwed up. All that needs to be said has been said; there is little left to add.</p>
<p>What remains is for each of us to take personal responsibility for learning about the virus (since the government has done a very poor job of teaching us) and its risks. There are good sources of information outside of the government world. Seek them out. Then, we can play our part in ensuring a fiasco like this does not occur again.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Brace for more swine flu deaths, top MD warns; Virus spreading faster across Canada</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>816 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Four new swine flu-related deaths were reported in Alberta on Thursday as the nation's top physician warned Canadians to be prepared for the toll to climb in the coming weeks as the H1N1 pandemic is showing no signs of slowing down.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the spread of the H1N1 virus picked up speed over the past week, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones told a news conference, and its prevalence is nearing levels that were seen at the peak of the first wave in June.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said there are more regions reporting outbreaks, especially in the western provinces, and the number of hospitalizations and intensive-care unit admissions has tripled since last week.</p>
<p>"We expect to hear of more illness and deaths in the coming weeks as we go further into the second wave. This is something we have to be prepared for as much as it saddens us," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>"It's why prevention remains our goal, for all Canadians to be immunized when their turn comes and ensure appropriate treatment with antivirals for those who are ill."</p>
<p>The latest death toll from the Public Health Agency of Canada indicates that 115 Canadians with H1N1 have died.</p>
<p>This week's toll is believed to include a two-month-old baby from London, Ont. Ethan Bailey Desabrais died of influenza but test results were pending to determine if it was the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>"I was trying to save my son," said the little boy's mother, Carla Desabrais.</p>
<p>"We were driving down the street and we were yelling for any emergency vehicle that was coming toward us. ... Every day is a haze."</p>
<p>The Desabrais's nine-year-old daughter and 18-month-old son both have been vaccinated. Ethan was not eligible because he was under six months of age.</p>
<p>The child was pronounced dead at hospital.</p>
<p>"Go get the shot," the mother said Thursday.</p>
<p>Health officials in Alberta, meanwhile, announced that they had seen four more deaths in the past few days.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said there were no indications the virus is being held at bay.</p>
<p>"Not a bit. Anybody that thinks that we've seen anything but the beginning of this, I think that would be lovely, but it's a bit of wishful thinking. This will continue to increase," he said.</p>
<p>Getting the H1N1 vaccine into people's arms is the key measure to slow the spread of the pandemic, and as people await their turn for their shot, other prevention methods, such as people staying home when sick, coughing into their sleeves and frequent handwashing are important, he advised.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones is also offering his advice in full-page advertisements appearing in 125 newspapers across the country today and Saturday.</p>
<p>In the advertisement, Butler-Jones writes that he wants to provide "the facts" about the H1N1 immunization program, which has been under heavy attack by opposition MPs on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>He assures Canadians there will be enough vaccine for the entire population and that "getting vaccinated is a safe and effective way to protect yourself and others" from the virus.</p>
<p>During Thursday's news conference, Butler-Jones said the provinces and territories are administering the H1N1 vaccine as quickly as they can and by early next week, he anticipates that six million Canadians will have been immunized.</p>
<p>Fine-tuning delivery</p>
<p>Clinics are still fine-tuning how they deliver the vaccine, and that includes figuring out ways to use every last drop of it.</p>
<p>There have been reports about some doses being tossed out at the end of the day. Butler-Jones said each vial contains 10 doses and he hopes that wastage is "minimal."</p>
<p>"I think that's something that everybody should and will be looking at."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones and federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq both expressed their thoughts on the reports this week that some NHL players have been immunized ahead of the general population, while people in high-risk groups have been lining up for hours since clinics opened last week.</p>
<p>"I'm pleased that they are so keen and interested in getting the vaccine, it shows how important it is, but please wait until your group is ready," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>An Alberta Health Services employee was fired after Calgary Flames players and their families, were allowed to get the vaccine and in Ontario, health officials are promising to investigate how some players with the Toronto Maple Leafs and Toronto Raptors got their shots.</p>
<p>"I think a review of this issue is merited. I don't feel that at this point in time that the time is right for this to happen, but it is something that we will be looking into," said Ontario's chief medical officer, Dr. Arlene King.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health care Albertans' top concern, survey shows</b>
</div><div>Tony Seskus   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>523 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Health care has emerged as the leading issue for Albertans for the first time since the economy sunk into a troubling recession late last year, a new poll says.</p>
<p>One-third of Albertans now say they consider health care to be the province's most important issue, says an exclusive <span class="companylink">Environics Research Group</span> survey.</p>
<p>"Health care is sort of our <span class="companylink">apple</span>-pie issue ... as Canadians and as Albertans, and so whenever there's a threat to the system, people become concerned," Environics pollster Tony Coulson said Thursday.</p>
<p>The economy remains a key concern, however. The poll of 1,000 Albertans shows 29 per cent of residents identify economic issues as a leading concern.</p>
<p>But the telephone survey, conducted Oct. 19 to 31, suggests at least some of the financial doom and gloom is beginning to ebb.</p>
<p>Nineteen per cent of Albertans believe the economy is getting stronger, up from 11 per cent a year ago.</p>
<p>Though 32 per cent of respondents believe the economy is getting weaker, that's better than the 40-per-cent figure a similar poll found in October 2008.</p>
<p>"The broad sentiment is that the economy is going to chug along for awhile and hopefully growth will return before too long," Coulson said.</p>
<p>Like many Albertans, the economy was top of mind Thursday for Premier Ed Stelmach, who acknowledged the hardships the downturn has brought. "It is a significant recession," he said. "We realize that and we're going to keep ensuring that we're working with Albertans."</p>
<p>Despite a languishing economy and Alberta's financial woes -the province faces a projected budget deficit of $6.9 billion -health care has emerged as the leading issue on many minds. One-third of Albertans now say it's the most important issue the province faces; only one in five respondents thought so last year at this time.</p>
<p>However, since the fall of 2008, the provincial government has had to shrink spending as it deals with the impact of a slumping world economy and weaker energy prices.</p>
<p>Last month, the province's health superboard asked employees to take a voluntary two-year wage freeze. In September, the board revealed plans to shut 290 Calgary and Edmonton acute care beds as it moves seniors from hospitals into nursing homes.</p>
<p>"I know right now the buzz is about H1N1, the flu, and there is some of that (in the poll), but it doesn't account for that whole jump," Coulson said.</p>
<p>Val Crompton, who took her two grandchildren to a northeast Calgary clinic Thursday for H1N1 shots, said uncertainty about the health-care system has many Albertans concerned.</p>
<p>"With health care you never know what to expect," said Crompton. "Are they going to do your hip or not?Will your kids get their shots or not?"</p>
<p>On the economy, Coulson said views across the province were largely consistent, calling it a "wait-and-see" mood. The poll found 59 per cent of Albertans are not worried about the overall economic situation, while 41 per cent are worried.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tories to debate Stelmach's leadership; Annual convention will also discuss Bill 50, health superboards</b>
</div><div>Archie Mclean   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>591 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Around the government caucus table, there's not much talk these days of turfing Bill 50, ditching the health superboards or limiting the export of raw bitumen.</p>
<p>But those ideas and more will be up for debate at the PC party's annual general meeting, which starts today in Red Deer.</p>
<p>All eyes at the convention will be on Premier Ed Stelmach, who faces a mandatory review of his leadership on Saturday.</p>
<p>Stelmach won a powerful majority in last year's election, but has had a rough time this fall, including a byelection loss in Calgary and criticism of the government's handling of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>On top of that was an Environics poll released Thursday that showed the party slipping in support, from 55 per cent last year to 34 per cent now.</p>
<p>But before the results of Stelmach's review Saturday there will be debates on the roughly 50 resolutions. They cover everything from the mundane, like the party's business plan, to the potentially explosive, such as one from Calgary Fish Creek that would allow Albertans to "access health care in as timely a manner as possible within a private, public or blended system."</p>
<p>The Edmonton-Whitemud constituency has a resolution calling for the government to slow the export of raw bitumen out of the province, "by taking whatever appropriate action is necessary."</p>
<p>One of those possible actions is legislation that would require some upgrading before bitumen could leave Alberta.</p>
<p>Education Minister Dave Hancock, the MLA for the constituency, gave the resolution his approval.</p>
<p>"My constituency put it forward, so I'd better support it," Hancock said.</p>
<p>He said it's not so far away from government policy to encourage refinement here.</p>
<p>"The purpose of the resolution is to get it on the table for discussion," Hancock said. "It's basically encouraging them to say, 'let's get to work, let's do it.' "</p>
<p>The St. Albert constituency has a resolution calling for the government to balance its books using any means, including taxes, levies and borrowing for capital purposes.</p>
<p>MLA Ken Allred hadn't read the resolution, but said it was meant only to encourage the government to slash the deficit over the next three years.</p>
<p>Other controversial resolutions include one from Edmonton-Castle Downs MLA Thomas Lukaszuk's riding suggesting the new health superboard has "disenfranchised various regions of Alberta" and calls on the government to add more boards.</p>
<p>Sustainable Resource Development Minister Ted Morton's riding has a resolution calling on the government to abandon Bill 50, its controversial power-line legislation.</p>
<p>According to the party's executive director, the resolutions aren't a sign of a divided party.</p>
<p>"It's the sign of a healthy party," said Jim Campbell.</p>
<p>Some years, the policy debates have been open to the media, but they are closed this year for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Campbell said party members feel more comfortable debating the ideas without being watched or recorded.</p>
<p>"They want a free and open discussion," he said.</p>
<p>The resolutions that pass the convention will be taken to government caucus. They are not binding, however, so MLAs can choose to do what they want with them</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wildrose Alliance's gains dismissed; Latest poll results not unexpected: premier</b>
</div><div>Jason Fekete; With files from Archie McLean   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>770 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Alberta's premier and his cabinet ministers are shrugging off new poll results that suggest the upstart Wildrose Alliance party is nipping at the heels of the government in terms of popular support.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach, who faces a leadership review at his party's annual convention on Saturday, said given the economy and other serious issues facing the province, the poll numbers aren't unexpected.</p>
<p>"Generally speaking, when a government is elected there is a drop in popularity after the election," he said. "It is a difficult time, obviously, for families and businesses. I fully realize that because I've lived through some difficult times myself. But we're going to work through together with all Albertans."</p>
<p>Many of Stelmach's cabinet ministers said Thursday they think support for the Wildrose Alliance will quickly fade once voters get to know the party better. They also argued the survey results won't affect the premier's leadership review this weekend at the Progressive Conservative convention in Red Deer.</p>
<p>Finance Minister Iris Evans said she's certain Stelmach, who took over the party reins after Ralph Klein stepped down in 2006, still has the support of rank and file members.</p>
<p>"If we stick to the knitting and do our jobs with the premier over the next two and a half years, he'll be re-elected resoundingly next time," Evans said. "And I know that this weekend is a tough weekend, for everybody, because everybody is a little jittery. It's always silly season before any vote and I think there's a lot of speculation. But at the end of the day, he'll win."</p>
<p>Treasury Board President Lloyd Snelgrove, one of Stelmach's top lieutenants, said this week's poll will have no impact on the leadership review.</p>
<p>The poll, conducted by <span class="companylink">Environics Research Group</span> and provided exclusively to The Journal and the Calgary Herald, suggests the governing Tories have sunk to their lowest popular support in 16 years, barely ahead of the Wildrose Alliance as the preferred party among decided voters.</p>
<p>The independent survey of 1,000 adult Albertans (840 decided voters) suggests the Wildrose Alliance has firmly cemented itself in second place provincewide--and overtaken the dynastic Tories as the favoured party in Calgary.</p>
<p>The telephone poll, conducted Oct. 19-31, suggests that 34 per cent of decided voters would cast ballots for Stelmach and his Conservatives if an election were held today, compared to 28 per cent for the fledgling Wildrose Alliance and new leader Danielle Smith.</p>
<p>David Swann's Liberals are in third with the backing of 20 per cent of voters, followed by Brian Mason's NDP at nine per cent and the recently delisted Green party at eight per cent.</p>
<p>"It's got nothing to do with the leadership (review)," Snelgrove said of the poll.</p>
<p>"I've got a hunch the bloom will come off the rose," he said of the Wildrose party.</p>
<p>The Wildrose Alliance has shot to prominence on the political radar after a surprising byelection win in Calgary and the election of a new leader, former journalist Smith, who has promised to build a mainstream conservative party to challenge the Tory dynasty.</p>
<p>The Progressive Conservatives have won 11 consecutive elections in Alberta.</p>
<p>Culture Minister Lindsay Blackett said he's confident the government's accomplishments will stand on their own merits.</p>
<p>"Look at what our government's done," he said. "Look at the fact that across the world, across the country we're all facing the same tough problems, whether it's H1N1, whether it's the economy. And we've done a lot to position Alberta to be in a place to be able to recover from this better than most other places. We'd be the laughingstock of Canada if we changed any of that right now."</p>
<p>The Wildrose party's surge in the polls was predictable, given that it won a Calgary byelection this fall and selected a new leader a few weeks ago, said Aboriginal Affairs Minister Gene Zwozdesky</p>
<p>"I'm not surprised to see poll results that buoy a particular party after coming off an election victory, that could be expected. But we're focused on our message, and that's just to help navigate Alberta through these difficult economic times with a better view to the future."</p>
<p>"We're focused on our needed priorities and that's keeping Albertans working and navigating through a difficult economic period."</p>

</div><div>Sun News Services</div>

</p>
<p>A report by the Columbus Chamber issued Thursday suggests that the future of the Columbus Blue Jackets is in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Chamber president and CEO Ty D. Marsh said that under the current economic model, the National Hockey League franchise is losing $12 million US per year.</p>
<p>"We believe there is a sense of urgency here," Marsh told the Cleveland Leader. "We're looking for a solution or progress by the end of the year."</p>
<p>The newspaper reported that the Blue Jackets and the area around Nationwide Arena brings in an estimated $30 million a year in tax money. Marsh said that the city is looking at a deal that could help save $5 million yearly in the arena lease and another $4 million in operational losses.</p>
<p>Blue Jackets president Mike Priest declined to comment to the newspaper whether the franchise could get out of its long-term arena lease and move to a different city without having to declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>"The current ownership group is not in a position to continue to deal with the arena's structural [financial] problem,"he said.</p>
<p>"Time is of the essence. This process was started a long time ago."</p>
<p>The Blue Jackets joined the NHL as an expansion franchise in 2000.</p>
<p>FLU HITS BEANTOWN: The Boston Bruins say forward David Krejci has been diagnosed with swine flu.</p>
<p>General manager Peter Chiarelli announced Thursday that the team's medical staff confirmed a diagnosis of H1N1 for the 23-year-old Krejci, who is in his fourth season with the Bruins.</p>
<p>The club said Krejci will be kept away from the team until he has had no symptoms or fever for 24 hours. Chiarelli said the Bruins are taking precautions to try to protect others in the organization.</p>
<p>After scoring 22 goals and 51 assists last season, Krejci received a three-year contract worth more than $11 million US a few days before having hip surgery in June. In 14 games this season, he has one goal and four assists.</p>
<p>DISAPPOINTED IN DENVER: A winning team and an exciting team.Two fan-friendly attributes didn't mean much in Denver on Wednesday night as the smallest crowd in Colorado Avalanche history showed up to the Pepsi Center. Colorado topped Phoenix 4-1 in front of 11,012 ticket buyers.The number was more than 2,000 fewer than the previous low crowd, reports the Denver Post.The win was the 11th for the Western Conference leaders and pushed Colorado's home mark to 5-0."Our job is just to go out and play hockey and our job is to provide entertainment for our fans," Avs coach Joe Sacco said to the Post. "I think that we've done a good job of that this year so far."</p>

</div><div>Iain MacIntyre   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>352 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>F1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The Vancouver Canucks will explore the possibility of getting flu vaccinations during their five-game road trip through the United States, which began Thursday with winger Steve Bernier displaying flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Bernier, isolated from teammates at the Canucks' hotel, did not play Thursday night against the Minnesota Wild and was scheduled to travel on his own today to Dallas.</p>
<p>Canuck general manager Mike Gillis said he didn't want Bernier on the post-game team charter to Texas in case other players became infected.</p>
<p>He said it was too early to say if Bernier has swine flu, but the National Hockey League team's medical staff does not believe the 24-year-old has the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>"There are other types of flu, too," Gillis said, aware of the hysteria over H1N1. "We won't know until he has a throat swab and a full examination. He's already starting to feel better."</p>
<p>The Canucks have been playing without as many as eight players due to injury -- Thursday's return of checking centre Ryan Johnson still leaves seven players out -- and can ill-afford a flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The Calgary Flames' queue-jumping for H1N1 vaccinations this week sparked widespread outrage and a government investigation in Alberta, and Gillis insisted the Canucks have no intention of doing the same in B.C.</p>
<p>He said, however, the team will consider getting vaccinated during the Canucks' five-game, 11-day road trip across the U.S., where H1N1 vaccine may be more available through America's private system.</p>
<p>"Obviously, there's a limited supply, so it may be unrealistic."</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, the Canucks scheduled flu shots for their players during the week of Nov. 15, when Vancouver has five days between games after its road trip ends Nov. 14 in Denver. But there is no guarantee vaccine will be available to them in B.C., which is why the Canucks are considering getting inoculated in the U.S.</p>

</p>
<p>NEXT GAME</p>
<p>Tonight vs. Edmonton Eskimos</p>
<p>7:30 p.m.</p>
<p>At BC Place Stadium</p>
<p>TSN/1040AM</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Somewhere on earth there are people, outwardly sane people -- stuck-in-the-'80s people, perhaps, or Don Matthews fans -- who will mist up a little, maybe even dab a few tears away, when they collapse the big marshmallow sky of BC Place Stadium for the last time.</p>
<p>(Or what used to be a big marshmallow sky, but these days looks more like, I don't know, somebody's mammoth white quilt that got dragged behind the car for 27 years down a dirt road, and would cost too much to dry clean.)</p>
<p>For the B.C. Lions, tonight is it.</p>
<p>What amounts to the only home playoff game the Leos will have this season -- because when the real post-season starts, they will be on the road at best, and on the outside looking in at worst -- marks the last time they will play under the dome, before it comes down following the 2010 Olympics.</p>
<p>After tonight's regular-season finale against the also 8-9 Edmonton Eskimos, which guarantees the winner a playoff spot and the loser an anxious 24 hours before its fate is determined, the Lions will be gone from their home of the past 27 seasons. They'll play 2010 al fresco, in a temporary, pre-fab facility on the former site of Empire Stadium, and when they return in 2011, the air-supported ceiling will be gone -- replaced by a retractable curtain that will let in the sun or shut out the rain, but will never again be the immutable, depressing Roof That Time Forgot.</p>
<p>And you have to admit, that's a good thing, whether you are from the Save The Dome crowd that was in favour of replacing the roof . . . or from the Blow It Up faction that thought there was nothing wrong with BC Place that a little dynamite couldn't fix . . . or whether you wondered why the Lions and Whitecaps couldn't have put their heads together on Option C, considering that the soccer team's sugar daddy, Greg Kerfoot, was willing to put his own money into a new stadium, until he ran into the all-powerful Gastown hemp-shop/souvenir-store/panhandlers' lobby</p>
<p>. . .</p>
<p>Whatever your slant on the issue, the end of the dome, and the crappy playing surfaces that have camped beneath it, are reasons to celebrate, not mourn. When BC Place reopens in 2011, it will be with a one-piece FieldTurf playing surface that will remain in place and be covered over for conventions and concerts.</p>
<p>Lions coach-GM Wally Buono was leery of waxing sentimental on the eve of such an important game, and even disputes the home-dome advantage the Lions have enjoyed for 27 seasons. But it's been a considerable edge for the home team.</p>
<p>"I can remember coming here in the '80s, and it was like hell on wheels," Buono admitted. "It was hot, it was tough, it was loud. And they had great teams. It was a very hostile place."</p>
<p>The lighting under the dome always was kind of sketchy, and even now takes some getting used to, said Eskimos quarterback Ricky Ray. And the footing -- on that second-hand Olympic Stadium carpet made of checkerboard squares with a thousand seams -- presents problems of its own.</p>
<p>And yet, it was a semi-fabulous spectacle when it was brand new -- notwithstanding the bilious olive-green carpet that someone obviously thought looked better than a colour resembling, say, grass.</p>
<p>"It was a prosperous time for the CFL in 1983, and when you come in here as a rookie, you look up at that dome and think: 'Wow. This is the big time,' " said Eskimos head coach Richie Hall who, in 1983, was a rookie defensive back in Calgary.</p>
<p>"I was part of the first football game ever in this building. It was pre-season, the first game I ever started, and Mervyn Fernandez was the [Lions'] big guy, and just in the first quarter alone I gave up a 50-yard bomb for a touchdown and had a pass interference penalty. So I couldn't wait for halftime. I called my mother from the airport after the game and said, 'Mom, I think I'll be coming home very soon.' "</p>
<p>But he's still here.</p>
<p>Lions' defensive line coach Mike Roach was an assistant on that Stampeders team.</p>
<p>"The Guess Who had a concert, I remember they wheeled them out on flatbeds at halftime and had the concert and then drug 'em off. I thought that was terrific," said Roach, who was also on the Edmonton staff when the Eskimos won the '87 Grey Cup here. But it was a neutral site that day.</p>
<p>"It can be a very difficult place [for an opponent] to play," said Leos offensive tackle Jason Jimenez. "I remember vividly the 2006 Western final, I couldn't hear the guy next to me talking on the sidelines. The dome does have a lot of acoustic appeal, and I don't know what kind of sound properties the new roof will have, or how that's going to help us with crowd noise."</p>
<p>For better or worse, the $550-600 million it will take to replace the roof is in the budget.</p>
<p>"Well, I don't agree with it -- there are things that money could be better spent on to solidify other aspects of our society," said the socially-conscious Jimenez. "This must be the only major city in the world that doesn't have a highway connecting to the airport. On one hand it's a very livable city, but on the other hand, if you live here, getting around is . . ."</p>
<p>We know. Trying.</p>
<p>A new roof won't fix traffic, relieve homelessness, or fight swine flu.</p>
<p>It will just keep the rain off, and let the sunshine in on nice days.</p>
<p>But it will be white. Or start out that way.</p>

<p>Another B.C. doctor was under fire Thursday after he gave the H1N1 vaccine to members of a junior hockey club in Chilliwack, contrary to strict rationing guidelines around who is eligible for the flu shot.</p>
<p>It was the second time in two days a Vancouver-area physician has been accused of breaking the rules for the flu vaccine rollout, and part of an apparent national trend involving athletes jumping the inoculation queue ahead of higher-risk individuals.</p>
<p>Reports surfaced Thursday that some members and staff of the National Hockey League's Toronto Maple Leafs and the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors had received H1N1 flu shots ahead of other priority patients.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was revealed members of the Calgary Flames hockey team and their families had been vaccinated; the Alberta government fired a health official in response.</p>
<p>In B.C., authorities were still trying to establish what -- if anything -- went wrong in Chilliwack after a doctor admitted he gave the shot to 11 members of the Chilliwack Bruins.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Basson, the Bruin's team physician, told the Chilliwack Times he offered the vaccine to the hockey team after he found himself with 25 extra doses following an H1N1 clinic at his office Sunday.</p>
<p>Basson said he had gave the vaccine -- which has a 24-hour shelf-life -- to 250 high-risk patients. No one was turned away.</p>
<p>The remaining supply was headed for the trash, Basson said, unless he could find people to immunize quickly.</p>
<p>"With one phone call I could probably get rid of a lot of the shots," he said of his decision to contact the hockey team. "Otherwise, how do I do it on a Sunday afternoon?"</p>
<p>Eleven players consented to the vaccination.</p>
<p>Provincial health officer Dr. Perry Kendall declined to comment directly on the case when he faced off with reporters Thursday afternoon in what has become a regular briefing on the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We will be looking into it," he said.</p>
<p>But, broadly speaking, Kendall said he expects doctors to know who their priority patients are and use the limited vaccine supply "appropriately."</p>
<p>"It's a valuable commodity," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, doctors across the province were issued a stern reminder Thursday to stick to the established vaccination ground rules by their regulating body, the College of Physician and Surgeons of B.C.</p>
<p>"The College expects physicians to be aware of and comply with the priority list when administering the ... vaccine," it said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>The reminder followed reports that an Abbotsford doctor had vaccinated members of the Abbotsford Heat hockey team, contrary to provincial rules.</p>
<p>College registrar Dr. Heidi Oetter said doctors are under enormous pressure to offer the vaccine to all their patients, and are having a tough time turning people away.</p>
<p>"The demand for the vaccine has not matched the supply, and that is exactly why the provincial health officer has developed the priority schedule," she said.</p>
<p>Oetter said the college had received no official complaints about vaccine use, and no sanctions have been ordered.</p>
<p>Bruins president Darryl Porter said Western Hockey League officials were consulted.</p>
<p>"We never asked for it," Porter said.</p>
<p>Kendall said another 250,000 doses of the vaccine are expected to arrive in B.C. next week.</p>

</div><div>Martin Cleary   </div>

</p>
<p>This has been a week of quiet celebration for St. Mark Lions middle linebacker Drew Morris.</p>
<p>However, he plans to crank up the volume if the underdog Lions can beat the defending champion St. Peter Knights in the National Capital Secondary School Athletic Association senior tier 1 football final next Thursday at the Minto Sports Field.</p>
<p>Undefeated St. Peter is aiming for its seventh title since 1997, while St. Mark, playing in its ninth final in the past 10 years, will try to score its fourth title since 2001.</p>
<p>Morris scored a personal victory Wednesday, attending his first practice in 12 days after overcoming the H1N1 flu virus and bronchitis.</p>
<p>On the field Thursday, his contributions were noted as the host Lions rallied in the third quarter and edged the Ashbury Colts 16-15 in an NCSSAA semifinal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, St. Peter rebounded well from a two-week break, blanking the Sir Wilfrid Laurier Lancers 41-0 in the other semifinal.</p>
<p>Lancers quarterback Ryan Begin threw touchdown passes of 25 and 60 yards to Demetri Dalekos and Harrison Lowe, respectively, while Alex Skinner connected with Christian Eanga-Selenge on a 40-yard pass-and-run touchdown. Dalekos also ran 50 yards for a touchdown, and Isaiah Harris had a three-yard touchdown run. Begin kicked field goals from 30 and 25 yards, plus five converts.</p>
<p>Morris, who has caught the attention of Utah State University, spent eight days at home because of his illness.</p>
<p>"I was scared I wouldn't be able to come back to play," he said. "I got a lot of sleep.</p>
<p>"I was concerned for the team. I didn't want to leave them hanging for the semifinals. I wasn't sure I'd play."</p>
<p>Defensive coach Pat Kelly said Morris's heart was 100 per cent into the game, even if his weakened body couldn't match that level.</p>
<p>Morris agreed, minutes after his best play of the game was the last for Ashbury.</p>
<p>"I didn't have my best game, coming off the flu, but I turned (running back John Funston) in on a third-and-one situation to stop them on their last series."</p>
<p>The Lions defence played a key role, forcing turnovers that led to two touchdowns.</p>
<p>On Ashbury's first offensive play, St. Mark's Thomas Hoy recovered a fumble by Funston. The Lions struck quickly, with Arty Nault running 41 yards for a score.</p>
<p>Early in the third quarter, St. Mark's Will Parker recovered a punt-return fumble. Two plays later, Dylan Hines executed a successful one-yard quarterback sneak for the decisive touchdown.</p>
<p>Chris Fanning kicked a 26-yard field goal and a convert.</p>
<p>Ashbury scored its touchdowns in the second quarter. Harley Smallwood tipped a Hines pass and Adam Loiselle caught the ball and ran it 45 yards for a touchdown. On the next series, Colts quarterback Arya Mobasher drilled a four-yard touchdown pass to Anthony Doran.</p>
<p>Patrick Norton kicked two converts and a single.</p>
<p>Bulldogs split on Day 1</p>
<p>Goalkeeper Jennie McGregor stopped 69 of an estimated 75 shots as the John McCrae Bulldogs split their first two round-robin games of the Ontario Federation of School Athletic Associations' girls field hockey championship at Kitchener. The Bulldogs lost 5-1 to the Nelson Lords of Burlington, with Rashida Timbilla scoring for McCrae.</p>
<p>Later, McCrae edged Pickering 2-1 on goals by Timbilla and Monika Leck.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Leafs, Raptors jump queue; minister upset; Matthews calls for respect of H1N1 vaccine priority list</b>
</div><div>Lee Greenberg   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen; with files from Canwest News Service</div>
<div>817 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews was unsure Thursday whether professional hockey and basketball players who jumped the queue to receive the H1N1 flu vaccine had broken any rules.</p>
<p>Matthews said physicians and public-health officials had been asked to "respect the science" behind a decision to immunize certain groups before others. She was unclear, however, whether doctors who allowed professional athletes the vaccine ahead of priority patients could face sanctions.</p>
<p>"When it comes to the queue-jumpers, that's one of the questions that I'm exploring right now," she told reporters. "I need to better understand that, and, when I better understand that, I'll share it with you."</p>
<p>Reports surfaced Thursday that some members and staff of the National Hockey League's Toronto Maple Leafs and the National Basketball Association's Toronto Raptors had received the H1N1 flu shots ahead of other priority patients.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, it was revealed members of the Calgary Flames hockey team had been vaccinated en masse. The Alberta government then fired a health official.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Senators said their player and staff were waiting in line like other non-priority patients.</p>
<p>Vancouver Canucks general manager Mike Gillis insisted members of his team would not jump the queue, either. He said the Canucks would look into having the players receive vaccines in the U.S. during a road trip that began Thursday and ends Nov. 14.</p>
<p>If vaccine cannot be obtained in the U.S., the Canucks will wait their turn when they return to Vancouver, Gillis said.</p>
<p>"We're in line with everybody else," he said.</p>
<p>It was unknown exactly who on the Toronto teams received the vaccination.</p>
<p>Last week, public health officials announced a shortage of the vaccine and issued an edict that only priority groups were to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The priority groups include people under 65 with chronic conditions, pregnant women, children between six months and five years, health care workers, people in contact with children under six months old and people living in remote communities.</p>
<p>Matthews said she was upset to hear that pro athletes -- and possibly the people treating them -- had decided not to abide by the province's request.</p>
<p>"I don't care who you are, how rich you are, how famous you are," she said. "If you're not in the priority group, get out of line and let the people who are in priority groups get their vaccination. We will be expanding access to vaccine as quickly as we have the supply available. In the meantime, the priority groups have got to go first."</p>
<p>Ontario will open vaccinations to a second group of target patients as soon as supply permits. They include school-aged children between five and 18 years old, medical first responders such as ambulance personnel and firefighters, plus swine and poultry workers.</p>
<p>The chief public health officer of Canada, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said he was pleased that the pro athletes who had received H1N1 shots were "so keen and interested in getting the vaccine; it shows how important it is. But, please, wait until your group is ready."</p>
<p>Krejci on confirmed list</p>
<p>The Boston Bruins confirmed Thursday that forward David Krejci had been diagnosed with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old centre will be isolated from the rest of the National Hockey League team until 24 hours after he is fever free and symptom free.</p>
<p>"Like most people, we are taking many precautions to try to prevent our players and staff from contracting the H1N1 virus," Bruins general manager Peter Chiarelli said in a statement. "Our medical staff is working with David to get him healthy as soon as possible, and our players and staff will continue to take precautions with hopes of preventing the spread of the virus to others in the organization."</p>
<p>Krejci, a former Gatineau Olympiques player who is in his third full season with the Bruins, has one goal and four assists in 14 games this season. Last season, the Czech forward had 22 goals and 51 assists.</p>
<p>Several other NHL players have been diagnosed with the virus, including Edmonton Oilers defenceman Ladislav Smid, Washington Capitals forward Quintin Laing, Colorado Avalanche goaltender Peter Budaj and New York Islanders forward Doug Weight.</p>
<p>Canucks winger Steve Bernier has flu-like symptoms and has been isolated from teammates, but Gillis said the team didn't know Thursday if it was a case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Bernier, absent from the Canucks' morning skate ahead of Thursday night's game against the Minnesota Wild, was given his own hotel room and was to return to Vancouver today.</p>
<p>"There are other types of flu, too," Gillis said. "We won't know until he has a throat swab and a full examination."</p>

</p>
<p>So how about those byelections? Truly portentous events portend. The eyes of the world are on Montmagny, Que.</p>
<p>Oh, you thought I meant New Jersey, where the Republicans just captured a bright blue state house. Or Virginia, where they took back the Old Dominion from the glorious Democrats by 18 percentage points. Or New York's 23rd district, where a liberal Republican was ousted for excess liberalism before they even voted, allowing the Democrat to squeak by a Conservative insurgent. Or the Maine referendum, where gay marriage lost for only the 31st time in 31 U.S. state votes.</p>
<p>Pshaw. I'm talking about Canada's byelections. Elections Canada insists such things are under way in Cumberland-Colchester-Musquodoboit Valley, Hochelaga, Montmagny-L'Islet-Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup and New Westminster-Coquitlam. Maybe the problem is the names. In a classic Pace Picante sauce ad, a southern cop denounces the dreaded other brand made in "NEW JERSEY?!?" whereas it's hard to spit out "Montmagny-L'Islet-Kamouraska-Rivière-du-Loup" with indignant regional pride.</p>
<p>The insulting alternative would be to conclude that politics in the United States is more interesting, more important or both. But that cannot be. After all, we know Canada is on the cutting edge of progressive soft power environmental social justice and the world longs for more of us, while the U.S. is obnoxious, overbearing and primitive.</p>
<p>Tuesday's Citizen reported a Historica-Dominion Institute poll saying nearly 90 per cent of us like Barack Obama and 70 per cent like individual Americans, but less than half feel at home in the U.S. (only one third of Quebecers do, but since they don't feel at home in Canada either, maybe they're just malcontents). Things haven't changed since 2005, though back then only 21 per cent of us liked the no-good low-down incumbent Republican worst-ever president. And more than two thirds think Canadian and American values are as different as in 2005 or more so.</p>
<p>It's hard to test the last point since they don't let us vote on stuff like gay marriage up here. Heck, they don't even let our parliamentarians vote on it. Our values, if any, are an undiscovered country. But who cares? "American-style" remains the ultimate political insult.</p>
<p>So it strikes me as a bit weird that the Ontario Liberal Party just held a convention in Windsor so boring no one noticed it (apparently including their own webmaster) where the keynote speaker was former John Kennedy speechwriter Ted Sorensen. Talk about fresh new ideas ... from before Michael Ignatieff even went to Harvard.</p>
<p>Even stranger, an NDP press release in May hyperventilated that their federal convention in Halifax in August would feature a keynote address from "Anita Dunn, director of communications to the Obama for America Presidential campaign" and a speech by Marshall Ganz, a "Harvard University lecturer" who "advised Obama on organizing, training and leadership development.". And it quoted the NDP's national director that, "The focus of the convention will be on winning strategies for the next campaign. With Obama's inner circle, we'll be learning from the best." You can readily imagine what the NDP would say if the Tories boasted of learning tactics from a top American operative. Then there was a Sept. 2 e-mail showing Jack Layton and the slogan "CHANGE you can BELIEVE IN," which I vaguely associate with some Illinois senator's presidential campaign. Not that we're jealous.</p>
<p>Oh, and when Ralph Nader urged Canadians to support the NDP in 2004 or the "Quebec party," whose name he hadn't bothered to learn (dang ignorant Americans who come to Canada in July with skis on their roof racks), Jack Layton said "We appreciate his endorsement ... I think it will underline that someone of great credibility is supporting us." No doubt he'd control his sneer reflex if Sarah Palin endorsed Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>The point is, Canadian politics is really interesting and conducted on a far more elevated plane. Except when the Liberals demand an emergency debate on H1N1 to find out why the Tories favour influenza (oh yeah, because they're uncaring bums) and why they bought vaccine from one company (oh yeah, because the Liberal government signed the contract; talk about a debating emergency).</p>
<p>That's why we're glued to the Hochelaga byelection, to see whether the Bloc can get it back from the Liberals, or the Liberals from the NDP, or the Tories, or whoever used to hold wherever it is. And whenever they're voting.</p>
<p>We just took a glimpse at New Jersey to see if Americans were enlightened enough to adopt our crushingly expensive health-care system complete with long waiting lines. They're not. They're loud vulgar bums. Now back to the Musquodoboit Valley.</p>

</p>
<p>Two H1N1 treatment centres have opened in the Gatineau area to take the strain off hospital emergency rooms. A third is to open Saturday.</p>
<p>The centres are for people who are showing flu-like symptoms and who do not have immediate access to a health-care provider, said Céline Jacob, a spokeswoman for Outaouais health and social services.</p>
<p>Treatment centres in Gatineau (777 de la Gappe Boulevard) and in Aylmer (425 LeGuerrier Road) opened Wednesday. The third centre is to open Saturday at 207 du Mont-Bleu Boulevard in Hull.</p>
<p>Patients will have to present a health card, or a birth certificate and proof of Quebec residency.</p>
<p>The centres act as an extension of the online self-care guide -- available in French and English through www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca[http://www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca] -- intended to help people make informed decisions on whether to seek extra care. The guide suggests courses of actions based on symptoms. Quebecers who are still unsure of what to do can call Info-Santé at 811.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the unadjuvanted vaccine has arrived in the Outaouais and will be distributed soon, said Jacob, though she couldn't say exactly when it would be available. It will be offered at every clinic, Jacob said.</p>
<p>She said queues for the vaccine have dwindled, thanks to a decision to stagger the groups of vulnerable patients eligible for the flu shot.</p>
<p>On Thursday the Quebec Health Ministry was still compiling data on the number of people vaccinated in the Outaouais, as well as the remaining supply of vaccine. The ministry will use these figures to plan the next wave of flu shots. It is still unknown when the vaccine will become generally available to inhabitants of Gatineau, des Collines and Vallée-de-la-Gatineau.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa has long way to go before 'herd' immune to H1N1</b>
</div><div>Joanne Laucius and Kate Jaimet   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>858 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Early</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Ottawa has hundreds of thousands of H1N1 flu shots to go to meet the threshold for "herd immunity" to the illness, says Ottawa's medical officer of health. Dr. Isra Levy said Thursday he expects 140,000 people in Ottawa -- about 15 per cent of the population -- will be vaccinated by the weekend. But medical experts believe up to 80 per cent of the population will have to be vaccinated in order for herd immunity to kick in. That means that Ottawa may have more than 700,000 shots in the arm left to go.</p>
<p>The principle of herd immunity suggests vaccination reduces the spread of infectious diseases even in people who haven't been vaccinated.</p>
<p>Effectively vaccinated people are immune to illness; after a certain point, an infectious disease has great difficulty spreading because it keeps running into immune systems that are prepared for it. People can still get sick, but at a much reduced rate.</p>
<p>Those who are unvaccinated are, in effect, protected by those who are vaccinated. And those who are vaccinated are sharing some protection with everyone they associate with.</p>
<p>"By extension it protects those around you," said Levy. "If I am protected, so are my loved ones."</p>
<p>Medical opinions on how many people need to be vaccinated before herd immunity takes effect have ranged from 50 to 80 per cent of the population, he said.</p>
<p>"We had planned for up to 40 per cent being interested (in H1N1 vaccinations). I'd hoped for 80 per cent -- if not more," Levy said.</p>
<p>A public opinion poll by Ipsos Reid released only three days before Ottawa's first flu clinic opened on Oct. 26 suggested that about half of Canadians were apathetic or reluctant to get a flu shot.</p>
<p>About 30 per cent said they are not at all likely to roll up their sleeves, while 18 per cent said they are not very likely. The remainder appeared to be at least a little convinced. About 36 per cent said they were very likely to get the vaccine and 15 per cent said they were somewhat likely to get a shot.</p>
<p>Levy said he expected questions about apathy to emerge. But there has been significant interest in Ottawa's clinics since they were opened 11 days ago.</p>
<p>Levy is still urging everyone to get vaccinated. And he hopes that the rush to flu clinics will give assurance to skeptics and those who are anxious. There have been few side-effects so far, he said.</p>
<p>Mathematically, herd immunity really starts to pay off when one infected person infects less than one other person, said Dr. Amir Attaran, an immunologist who holds the Canada Research Chair in Law, Population Health and Global Development Policy at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"Herd immunity causes an epidemic to shrink rather than grow," he said.</p>
<p>He believes that when the H1N1 vaccine is readily available to the general public, more people will seek to get vaccinated, just because it will be less arduous than waiting in line.</p>
<p>But he added that herd immunity can't be predicted based only on vaccination rates because some people who become infected naturally will also have immunity when they recover.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ottawa's associate medical author of health Dr. Nadine Sicard estimates that there are "a good three weeks" left in this wave of the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>She said historically, pandemic flu waves tend to last from six to eight weeks.</p>
<p>If the same turns out to be the case with the H1N1 virus this fall, it's possible the second wave will have subsided by the time many people, including school-aged children, are able to get the shot.</p>
<p>Levy said parents shouldn't assume that vaccinating their kids is useless if they don't get the shot within the next three weeks.</p>
<p>"It's very, very hard to describe and identify where we are in a wave while it is happening," he said. "Our best guess is we're on the upswing of a second wave. We don't really know how long that wave will last."</p>
<p>He added that there could be a third wave of H1N1 sickness, or that lower-level activity of the virus could persist in the community throughout the four-to-five month flu season, even after the second wave has peaked and diminished.</p>
<p>No third wave of the virus has yet been seen in the Southern hemisphere, which experienced its second wave during our summer months.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of debate on whether we could see a third wave or not," said Sicard.</p>
<p>It's never too late to get an H1N1 shot, said Levy.</p>
<p>"We can have most of the community vaccinated by the end of the year."</p>

<p>After reading several government-issued H1N1 vaccine schedules, checking government websites, and phoning my local CLSC to make certain my 5-year-old qualified for yesterday's cattle call, I joined the long lineup outside the vaccination centre at the crack of dawn.</p>
<p>The longer we waited in that long queue, however, the more chatter I heard about cut-off dates so I asked some pointed questions and was told that my daughter is not 5 years old but 5 years and 5 months and therefore ineligible. I left, but many parents with older children continued to wait, perhaps hoping they wouldn't be asked for proof of age.</p>
<p>What kind of system do we have that makes it is so difficult to print exactly who will be vaccinated and up to what dates children will be eligible? To me a child is 5 until they turn 6.</p>
<p>Precise information regarding exact age cut-offs is not difficult to transmit and would allow the right people to get the vaccine at the right time. Waiting for the shot is turning out to be highly stressful, extremely confusing and after what I witnessed yesterday, a highly unethical process. My 5-year-old might be "too old" for a flu shot today, but I'm glad she's too young to see what's really going on.</p>

<p>Re: "No time to play politics - or jump queues" (Editorial, Nov 4).</p>
<p>You say that "in an ordinary year, ordinary flu and pneumonia kill about 13 Canadians per 100,000." With a population of more than 33 million, that translates to more than 4,000 Canadian deaths annually. Of the ordinary flu and influenza!</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic is still in it's very early stages, so people, please, have some perspective, patience and don't panic! We will all have our turn to be vaccinated.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ambulance transfer has 'kinks' to be cured; Slower emergency response worries civic leaders</b>
</div><div>Jason Markusoff   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>549 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>

<p>The province's takeover of ambulance services has led to some slower response times, dispatch woes and a strain on other emergency responders, big-city and small-town leaders told the health minister Thursday.</p>
<p>At a gathering of Alberta civic politicians, Ron Liepert fielded complaints from councillors struggling with doctor recruitment and superboard reforms, as well as two southern Alberta mayors who are front-line health workers irked they hadn't yet been vaccinated against the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>But even Liepert acknowledged growing pains with last April's switch from municipal ambulance service to a system fully funded and run by Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>"Are there going to be bumps in the road? Absolutely there are," he told reporters.</p>
<p>"But you notice we're only six months into it. I think we need to give some time to ensure all those kinks are worked out."</p>
<p>Vulcan Mayor Tom Grant said his town's volunteer firefighters have a 200-per cent larger workload since ambulances became a provincial responsibility.</p>
<p>The one dedicated Vulcan ambulance now also helps out around High River and Okotoks, northwest of the town, leaving up to 45-minute response times to homes in Vulcan and parts east of there, Grant said.</p>
<p>That means volunteer firefighters like the mayor have to take time off their jobs to be the first responders and use their training to assist while waiting for paramedics to arrive.</p>
<p>"There has been a huge decrease in quality since Alberta Health has taken over the ambulances," the mayor said.</p>
<p>Coun. Linda Sloan of Edmonton cited problems in the capital, too. There are four fewer ambulances patrolling Greater Edmonton, and the superboard has been reluctant to release specific data explaining response times.</p>
<p>"We now have a service which our citizens rely on for their very lives, and we have no way of determining whether it's being funded, monitored and resourced sufficiently to deliver the resource that we historically had," Sloan said.</p>
<p>Calgary hasn't reported the same problems, but its fire and police chiefs have criticized policies that block paramedics from sharing patient information.</p>
<p>Ambulance dispatching is also an issue. Outside cities, many paramedics are equipped with lower-cost devices: mobile phones with a special microphones.</p>
<p>"It doesn't work in the best of times outside, let alone at home," Grant said.</p>
<p>Bow Island's Gordon Reynolds also expressed worry about centralized dispatching.</p>
<p>"We're concerned that where distance is an issue, that could cost lives," the politician said.</p>
<p>Liepert told the crowd he's seen no indication that the ambulance system has missed response times, and argued that a more-integrated system will mean fewer ambulances running empty between communities. Meanwhile, he's contracted a former cabinet minister to lead consultations on smoother reforms of the dispatch system.</p>
<p>Other civic leaders were more complimentary of the province's long-delayed takeover of costly ambulance duties.</p>
<p>"Our expectations get a little ridiculous from time to time," said Bill Nimmo, mayor of the northeast town of Gibbons.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flames are not to blame</b>

</p>
<p>Last Friday, when the Calgary Flames got their H1N1 shots, the Calgary Herald had an editorial board meeting with Health Minister Ron Liepert. The defensive minister met with us from noon to 1 p.m. One hour later, the Flames team and some of their family members--including pregnant wives and children under five--had finished receiving their vaccinations at a Calgary clinic.</p>
<p>Needless to say, since then, this story and Albertans' emotions have burned out of control. Flames players are being unfairly likened to the men on the Titanic who took the place of women and children on the luxury ship's too few lifeboats. It's a powerful analogy, but unfair and wrong, and here's why.</p>
<p>When you learn the timing behind the Flames vaccination plan and couple that with the "everyone is welcome to get their shot" message coming out of the premier's mouth, what the team did doesn't look so bad.</p>
<p>After the NHL informed all teams to have their players vaccinated for H1N1, the Flames' two team doctors did some work, say sources at the Flames.</p>
<p>Ironically, the team wanted to prevent a public relations disaster by just showing up at some clinic and causing fandemonium, so they called Alberta Health officials to give them a heads-up.</p>
<p>The Flames organization asked if they could bring security to help control the predictable and inevitable chaos that would ensue when word got out that Flames players were standing in a lineup for four hours. Every media organization in town would have shown up along with every kid in a 20-mile radius, and parents in line with hockey-mad kids would have grumbled bitterly as their already hard-to-control kids scampered off to hover around their hockey heroes.</p>
<p>The Flames made those initial calls last Monday (Oct. 26). On Wednesday, an Alberta Health Services employee called and informed the Flames that, to avoid chaos, a special clinic would be held on Friday for the team. So, what was going on that Wednesday with regard to flu clinics? None other than Premier Ed Stelmach told all Albertans to go get vaccinated: "We're the province that is offering flu vaccines for every Albertan, not just to the high-risk groups." That was not unplanned messaging. How do we know? Because the very next day, Stelmach said: "We're not asking only those high-risk groups to get the vaccine first. It's open to all."</p>
<p>So, naturally, the Flames, like the rest of us assumed that everyone was welcome at these clinics and that there was lots to go around. Many people, like myself, stayed away because the lines were too long and my risk not high. But that whole week, no one in line felt shame for being there, because they were being asked to be there by the premier himself, the head of this whole botched mess.</p>
<p>My husband took our twin 12-year-old boys to be vaccinated on Thursday and did not intend to get a shot himself, but was talked into it by the pleasant nurse.</p>
<p>On Friday at noon, Liepert told the editorial board that supply was running short because of issues at Canada's only plant producing the vaccine and clinics might have to be closed by Monday or Tuesday. In fact, shortly after the minister left our editorial board meeting, clinics were shutting down lines. On Saturday, no clinics opened their doors and they remained shut until Thursday to vaccinate only children between the ages of six months and five years.</p>
<p>That's how fluid this whole thing has been. The Flames didn't ask for a special clinic, they were offered one to prevent chaos. In retrospect, and owing to the shortage of vaccine now, Canadians want to send the lot of them to the penalty box. That is a bad call, almost as bad as the provincial government firing the low-level official who approved of the Flames clinic. That, frankly, is disgraceful scapegoating.</p>
<p>Ultimately, whatever the Flames did, they would have been slammed for it. Had the players not been vaccinated and got sick and games were cancelled, there would have been a pandemic of rage for that. Had they shown up and stood in line, like everyone else, they would have been accused of being useful idiots for Big Pharma or for pulling a crass publicity stunt.</p>
<p>Hockey players are much like soldiers. They follow orders. Now, they're taking unfair shots.</p>
<p>Those are the facts. If that doesn't cool you down, then perhaps it's time you scored some Valium.</p>

<p>Talk about ingenious strategy by the Flames management and coaching staff. Get your whole team vaccinated against the H1N1 flu. The rival teams don't. The rival teams' key players start dropping like flies. The Stanley Cup is in the bag!</p>

<p>Re: "Flames' flu shots raise furor," Nov. 4.</p>
<p>Your article stated there is one individual who has decided to unload his Flames season's tickets on the Internet for face value, stating that "due to the Calgary Flames recent actions regarding the H1N1 vaccine, I can no longer call myself a Flames fan." I would like to ask this individual if he is also going to cancel his Alberta health-care coverage. This person obviously does not understand that the real problem is the way Premier Ed Stelmach and Health Minister Ron Liepert devised their original plan for vaccination. The Flames were vaccinated before the public knew there was a shortage of the vaccine. And were they wrong to avoid mob scenes and public chaos? No. Did they have the approval of Alberta Health Services? Yes.</p>
<p>The Flames are not to blame; our government and its mishandling of yet another crucial health issue should be our focus.</p>
