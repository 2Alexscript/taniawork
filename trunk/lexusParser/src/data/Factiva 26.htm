<p>The department charged with disaster planning is itself a disaster when it comes to preparing for emergencies such as swine flu, says Auditor-General Sheila Fraser.</p>
<p>"We found that Public Safety Canada has not exercised the leadership necessary to co-ordinate emergency management activities," Fraser concluded in her latest report, tabled in the House of Commons on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Fraser believes that had Public Safety Canada put pandemic-management plans in place, there would have been less confusion.</p>
<p>"It's important -- very important -- that the role and responsibilities of Public Safety Canada be agreed to and endorsed in these emergencies," Fraser told reporters The opposition parties seized on Fraser's findings in question period, blaming the long lineups for H1N1 immunizations and a vaccine shortage on the Conservative government's failure to have an organized plan.</p>
<p>"Doesn't that begin to explain why the government's response to this crisis has been so slow and so confused?" charged Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff.</p>

<p>On Monday, an emergency debate on the federal government's pandemic response resulted in all-too-predictable finger-pointing from opposition parties.</p>
<p>At times the finger wagging lapsed into the realm of the absurd. Liberal Party president Alfred Apps even suggested that the H1N1 crisis is Prime Minister Stephen Harper's "Hurricane Katrina." Not only did this metaphor bring about predictable outrage from Conservatives, even the odd Liberal suggested Apps' hyperbole did his side no favours.</p>
<p>Right now Canadians are dying as a result of the H1N1 flu. There are lineups at clinics across the country, as anxiety-ridden patients await their turn for the vaccine. Old information is suddenly new again; new information is suddenly old.</p>
<p>The situation is, frankly, a muddle. Canadians need more clarity from the professionals to help them make an important medical decision and our medical system must get its act in gear to ensure vaccine quickly reaches those who either need it or want it.</p>
<p>The flu is among us and the last thing we need is a bunch of posturing blowhards trying to score cheap political points.</p>

</p>
<p>W hat are we to take from the fact that most adult Canadians don't want to be immunized against the H1N1 flu? I know how they feel. I'm still on the fence myself about whether to get the shot. Being immunized definitely appears to be the logical, civic-minded choice, but there's this part of me that's just really hesitant about getting a flu shot.</p>
<p>And 51 per cent of Canadians apparently feel the same way.</p>
<p>Asked in an online poll this month about whether they'd be getting vaccinated against H1N1, more than half said no. That's up significantly from July, when only 38 per cent said no. This must be a great disappointment to public-health officials.</p>
<p>People were alarmed as all get-out when the new strain of influenza first took hold in Mexico, and the task back then looked like it was going to be about keeping a worried public calm until a vaccine could be developed.</p>
<p>Instead we've ended up here, with immunization now available but fewer Canadians actually wanting it. That's a fascinating turn of events.</p>
<p>What it suggests, more than anything, is that the public no longer knows who to trust about such things. That's especially true when it comes to flu shots.</p>
<p>We were terrified of H1N1 when it first started wreaking havoc in Mexico. I followed each new development with great interest as the virus took hold in the spring and had long conversations with my own adult children in hopes of getting them thinking about vaccination.</p>
<p>But then H1N1 arrived in our own towns. And in most cases it looked a lot like any other seasonal flu, except more people were getting it.</p>
<p>Public-health experts continued to emphasize that H1N1 had the potential to be a much more serious type of flu. People do die from it --- 101 so far in Canada. But it seems that the more H1N1 has taken hold, the more our skepticism about getting immunized has grown.</p>
<p>Canadians are skeptical of flu shots to begin with -- fewer than a third of us get the seasonal shot.</p>
<p>The peculiar thing is that we're generally pretty happy to get immunized. I got seven immunizations for a trip to Ghana a decade ago and didn't second-guess any of them. Most Canadians are quite willing to be immunized against major illnesses and to get their children immunized, so it's not like vaccination is a foreign idea.</p>
<p>Ah, but the flu shot -- for some reason, that's a whole different thing. North Americans overall just haven't taken to the flu shot, despite years of admonitions from public-health officials about the importance of doing so.</p>
<p>Is it because you need a shot every year? Or because you've had the flu many times and it hasn't killed you yet? Is it about the horror stories of vaccinations gone wrong that emerge just often enough to confirm your reluctance or maybe a secret suspicion that it's good for your immune system to have to fight off illness on its own once in a while? I admit to a little of all of those in my own feelings. And I know it's all about having an emotional reaction to the issue rather than a logical one. I hate being sick with the flu and I'm asthmatic to boot, so there's no sensible reason for me to resist inoculation.</p>
<p>In the case of H1N1, experiences in my own family this past month should have also pushed me toward immunization if logic had anything to do with it. My brother's wife is still recovering in hospital after a terrible bout of H1N1 that left her incapacitated and on a ventilator in the intensive-care unit for almost a week.</p>
<p>But there's something that I just can't get my head around when it comes to flu shots. I wish I understood my resistance better, because I like to think I make good choices when it comes to my health.</p>
<p>Public-health officials might want to try to understand the resistance of people like me as well, because their messages clearly aren't having the desired effect if the majority of Canadians are saying no to a flu shot.</p>
<p>Please take my musings on this subject as nothing more than that. I offer no advice on whether to get an H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>I'm just saying that rightly or wrongly, many of us need more convincing.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>People most likely to die from new flu will be middle-aged</b>
</div><div>John Bermingham   </div>
<div>The Province; with files from News Services</div>
<div>324 words</div><div>4 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>The grim statistics are in: The person most likely to die from H1N1? A middle-aged man or woman with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, the province's top doctor, says B.C.'s H1N1 profile shows the median age for those dying from the swine flu is 41.</p>
<p>Men account for 61.5 per cent of the 15 deaths in B.C., women 38.5 per cent -- and 61.5 per cent had an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>The most common of those were asthma, lung disease and immune suppression.</p>
<p>As for who ends up in hospital with H1N1, Kendall says it's most likely a child under five -- usually the under-twos -- with a fever and an underlying health condition.</p>
<p>Usually, they're discharged after 24 hours, Kendall says.</p>
<p>Most people who end up in the intensive-care unit are in their 30s and 40s. They spend two to three weeks in ICU, hooked to a ventilator.</p>
<p>The over-60s have the lowest risk of all, with only 1.5 per cent of all those sick.</p>
<p>That's why, Kendall said, seniors are currently being turned away for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The statistics hold true in other countries.</p>
<p>"If you're under the age of 50, this is a bad flu. This might be the worst flu experienced in 50 to 100 years," said Dr. Bela Matyas, acting chief of the emergency preparedness and response branch of the California Department of Public Health.</p>
<p>"If you are a teenager or younger, the chances of dying from this flu are much, much higher than any other flu we've seen, maybe, since the 1918 flu." But while people age 50 and older are less likely to become infected, they are the ones most likely to die if hospitalized with H1N1, reported Californian authorities.</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 toll of death and sickness is rising in B.C.</p>
<p>Three people died of the virus last week, including a man and woman in the Fraser health region and a person over 65 in the Vancouver Coastal health region. All three had an underlying medical condition.</p>
<p>B.C.'s death toll for H1N1 has hit 15; last week 162 people with swine flu were in hospital across the province -- almost double the 88 the week before.</p>
<p>As the outbreak numbers rise, supply of the vaccine dwindles.</p>
<p>Provincial Health Officer Dr.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall said Tuesday supplies will plummet to just 63,000 doses next week, due to problems with the supplier -- so there won't be the need for the current 200 clinics in B.C. to stay open.</p>
<p>The vaccine this week will be given only to people in high-risk groups, such as children age six months to five years and healthcare workers.</p>
<p>Another 25,000 doses of vaccine created for pregnant women is due in B.C. today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>By the weekend, 800,000 residents, or about one in five, will be vaccinated, Kendall said.</p>
<p>Kendall is still promising that anyone wanting a shot will get it by the end of December, and that able-bodied residents will be eligible for a shot later this month.</p>
<p>He called the H1N1 strain "mild to moderate" and noted that it continues to spread, nearly hitting its peak across the province.</p>
<p>About 50 people might die from H1N1, fewer than the 200 to 800 who die annually from seasonal flu, he said. Half of current respiratory illness in B.C. is due to H1N1, as are 10 per cent of all doctor visits.</p>
<p>In northern B.C., all five schools in the Kitimat area have been closed until Monday, leaving 1,300 students at home.</p>
<p>Coast Mountain School District Supt. Rob Greenwood said the decision was made when absenteeism hit 40 per cent in the elementary schools.</p>
<p>"Effective instruction is hard to do when you have half the classes missing," he said.</p>
<p>Kendall said he's concerned about reports that front-line health workers are falling sick with the flu.</p>
<p>At B.C. Women's Hospital, up to 25 per cent of nurses were sick with cold and flu symptoms last week.</p>
<p>Kendall said hospitals have reported higher absenteeism from health-care workers, putting pressure on emergency rooms, which have been swamped with visits.</p>
<p>Hospitals are prepared to go to essential-service levels, and could cancel elective surgeries or shut ambulatory clinics.</p>
<p>This week, front-line health-care workers are being vaccinated, and Kendall wants to have all 200,000 dosed next week.</p>
<p>But police officers, firefighters and jail guards will have to wait until the second round of shots, he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, reports that one-third of the general workforce could be absent with H1N1 was greeted with concern.</p>
<p>"How many could afford to lose 10 days' pay when they are living paycheque to paycheque," said Jim Sinclair, president of the B.C. Federation of Labour.</p>
<p>"There could be people taking a lot of precautionary action in terms of not going to work," said Jock Finlayson, executive vice-president of the Business Council of B.C.</p>

</p>
<p>The NDP says the the Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games (VANOC) forced the government to legislate paramedics back to work.</p>
<p>NDP labour critic Raj Chouhan revealed the "proof" Tuesday in the B.C. legislature, in the form of a memo from VANOC director of medical services Dr. Mike Wilkinson to government warning of the consequences if the services of paramedics couldn't be guaranteed.</p>
<p>"VANOC Medical Services . . . requires definitive confirmation by Oct. 1, 2009, that all required ambulance services will be provided as planned," Wilkinson wrote.</p>
<p>"This confirmation must also include a guarantee that no services during the Games will be disrupted or reduced from what has been planned."</p>
<p>Paramedics battled the government for a year in search of a new contract. Health Minister Kevin Falcon introduced Bill 21 on Monday to legislate a settlement.</p>
<p>In his memo to government, Wilkinson suggests the government either settle the strike or legislate an end to the dispute.</p>
<p>"If we are unable to obtain the guarantee, through either settlement of the strike or legislated détente for the Games, then VANOC will be required to initiate alternative contingency plans to avoid cancellation of the Games."</p>
<p>Chouhan told the legislature: "The reality is that VANOC is dictating what should be done. It's VANOC that's running this province, it seems. This minister and this government should be ashamed of what they have done."</p>
<p>Falcon didn't deny the Games played a part in his decision.</p>
<p>"The Olympics is a secondary but important issue. There's no question about it. I won't deny that the Olympics isn't important in this whole calculation, but the H1N1 pandemic is clearly the priority," he told reporters in Victoria.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Christiansen's slow start not hurting hockey Dogs</b>

</p>
<p>For two years, Shaye Christiansen was a mainstay at the top of the scoring sheet with the University of Saskatchewan Huskies women's hockey team. Six games into the 2009-10 season and heading into weekend action against the University of Calgary Dinos, Christiansen is near the bottom.</p>
<p>The fifth-year veteran finished the past two seasons with 18 and 19 points, respectively. This year, her final one with the Huskies, the nursing student has just two assists.</p>
<p>Christiansen admits with a laugh that she's aware of the drop, but with the Huskies' strong play this season -- at 4-2, they are second in the Canada West conference behind the 8-0 University of Alberta Pandas -- her lack of points is easier to ignore.</p>
<p>"It'd be a little tougher if the team were on the down side," Christiansen said. "I try not to focus on it. It won't come any easier if I dwell on it."</p>
<p>Huskies coach Steve Kook realizes it's a bit of a slow start for a talented forward like Christiansen, but isn't sure if she or her teammates would label it a "slump."</p>
<p>"She's got such a great shot," Kook said. "She just needs to pull the trigger more. It's not for lack of trying.</p>
<p>"I think she's more happy with where we are as a team."</p>
<p>Christiansen, who is from Canwood, said she has experienced slumps like this before, but kept to her game to get through it.</p>
<p>The Huskies will look to rebuild momentum after starting the season 4-0. They lost to the Pandas twice at home and had two games against the University of Lethbridge postponed last weekend because of an H1N1 outbreak in Lethbridge. The Huskies are home to the last place Dinos (1-5) on Friday and Saturday at 7 p.m. at Rutherford Rink.</p>
<p>"They're a lot better than their record shows," Kook said of the Dinos. "They're a good, young, hard-working team that we may have taken for granted in our last game."</p>
<p>Last month, the Huskies beat the Dinos 5-0 and 3-2.</p>

<p>The Alberta government is investigating how most players on the Calgary Flames -- along with some of their family members, coaching staff and management -- arranged to receive their H1N1 vaccine shots in private last week, while thousands of Albertans stood in the cold for hours to be inoculated.</p>
<p>Flames president Ken King said Tuesday the hockey club made arrangements for the team to have the shots last Friday at an off-site clinic within the public health system, a day before tight supplies spurred the Alberta government to restrict inoculations to only those deemed to be at greatest risk. The clinic was not one of those set up for the general public.</p>
<p>King said he believed that the inoculation procedure the Flames followed had gone through an Alberta Health Services process.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Alberta Health Services said if the Flames jumped the board's queue to get the shots it was a "mistake."</p>
<p>Mark Kastner, spokesman for Alberta Health Services, said the board itself did not make any special arrangements for the Flames.</p>
<p>"Based on the process that was in place on Friday, that would have been a mistake and shouldn't have happened," Kastner said.</p>
<p>King said the organization and the medical staff felt the players should receive the vaccination given the risks associated with frequent physical contact, extreme exertion and a busy travel schedule.</p>
<p>"Our players did not seek to avoid lineups, they did not seek special attention," King said. "We appreciate that this is a very sensitive issue and it was an organizational direction and we accept responsibility for that.</p>
<p>"Given the information that we had at the time, we made a request. We felt that that request went through Alberta Health Services' system appropriately and it would seem now, today, that it is deemed to be otherwise."</p>
<p>News of the Flames' queue-jumping is certain to spark outrage in Alberta, where short vaccine supplies and a questionable decision to offer the vaccine to all comers led to extremely long waits and the province's decision to suspend vaccinations last week. Alberta's vaccine clinics will be reopened for high-risk patients only on Thursday.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach -- already under heavy public pressure over the trouble-prone vaccine program -- said Tuesday the government would investigate the Flames' vaccine arrangement.</p>
<p>"If it has happened, somebody has broken the rules and we want to find out who it is, because it is deplorable," he told a raucous question period in the provincial legislature.</p>
<p>Team captain Jarome Iginla was one of the players to receive the shot. So did his family, including his children aged one, three and five.</p>
<p>He noted that the general public was still able to receive the shot when the team attended the clinic on Friday.</p>
<p>"As players, we were following the medical protocol given to us," Iginla said.</p>
<p>"Today we can see ... open the papers, and there's a shortage so, yeah, we can understand why people may be upset."</p>
<p>Defenceman Robyn Regehr said he was "happy" to be able to get the shot.</p>
<p>"They told us if we wanted to get it done Friday, we had the option," he said.</p>
<p>"For me, I was pretty happy given you're hearing all kinds of things that you might have to go across the border and what not ... at that point we had the option so I took it as a player."</p>
<p>Flames head coach Brent Sutter added that the team was simply following the advice of medical staff and the organization.</p>
<p>"That's what we did and that's all I've got to say on it," Sutter said.</p>
<p>When the inoculation process began last week, Stelmach encouraged all Albertans to get the flu shot.</p>
<p>NHL spokesman Frank Brown said Monday the league recommended flu shots, but did not mandate them.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan Roughriders linebacker Rey Williams said Tuesday he and his mates were ready to play the Calgary Stampeders in a showdown for first place in the CFL's West Division.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for the Roughriders, the game isn't until Saturday.</p>
<p>"We know how important this game is," Williams said after practice at Mosaic Stadium, where Saturday's game is to be played. "We win three games and we can be champions again.</p>
<p>"That's the approach we're taking. We practised with a sense of urgency (Tuesday) and I think we're focused. We know what we have to do. It's not going to be easy, but we know what we have to do."</p>
<p>The winning team Saturday gets home-field advantage in the West final along with a bye in the first week of the playoffs. The Roughriders haven't finished first in the West since 1976.</p>
<p>"We don't have anybody that was around for that one, so it's a new experience for all of us," Saskatchewan head coach Ken Miller said with a laugh when asked if he was reminding his charges of the historical nature of the game for the franchise.</p>
<p>"It's just wanting to win the Western Conference championship and get that week off. Those are the motivating factors. The fact that it's special for the organization in (terms of a) number of years, that just adds to the flavour."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Several Roughriders have had to deal with illness of late, but the majority of those players are regaining their health.</p>
<p>"We have had some people tested and we don't have H1N1 in our locker room right now ...," Miller said. "We're getting healthier as I speak. We had no new cases of flu or anything this week. We had one slight cold (Tuesday) morning, but we're getting better health-wise right now."</p>
<p>That cold belonged to defensive end John Chick, whom Miller said was kept out of the cold Tuesday because he had "the sniffles."</p>
<p>Offensive linemen Antonio Hall and Dan Clark and defensive lineman Luc Mullinder also didn't practise Tuesday.</p>
<p>Defensive back Lance Frazier, who missed Saturday's 24-6 loss to the host Hamilton Tiger-Cats due to dehydration, was back on the practice field Tuesday.</p>
<p>Defensive back Eddie Davis, who suffered a knee injury during the Roughriders' game Oct. 24 against the B.C. Lions, was in uniform Tuesday but didn't participate in drills.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Offensive co-ordinator Paul LaPolice was asked Tuesday whether the Roughriders will have any new wrinkles for the Calgary game, and whether some plays might be saved in case they meet the Stampeders again in the playoffs.</p>
<p>"We'll have some bullets for them,'' he said. "We'll have some things that we've got saved for them, and we'll fire all the bullets. What we want to do is we want to get first place. We have plenty of time from week to week, with the coaches on our staff, to have new bullets each week. We'll have a good game plan for them and the players will be ready.''</p>
<p>"Certainly you have to do variations on themes as you go through the season," Miller added. "You don't change your total outlook, but there are nuances that you adjust so that things have a similarity but are different."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The suggestion has been made that the loss to the Tiger-Cats could help the Roughriders refocus as they head into the biggest games of the season to date.</p>
<p>Miller, however, didn't see the defeat in Hamilton as "a good loss."</p>
<p>"I never want to go through an experience like that again, so to define it as 'a good loss,' I really can't do that," he said.</p>
<p>"There are some good things that happened in that game and I want to remember them, but the feeling that we had after that game is something that we want to forget."</p>

</p>
<p>Last Thursday, my wife was hit by the flu bug at about 3 a.m. Not to be confused by the H1N1 flu that has been capturing headlines, this one is a stomach flu that comes on quickly, drains everything out of you in a hurry and leaves you weak and tired for a few days. It has gone through everyone in my household, including myself the morning of the Hamilton game on Saturday.</p>
<p>I was struck at about the same time as my wife -- 3 a.m. in the hotel room in Hamilton.</p>
<p>I battled until about 8 a.m., when the team doctor and trainers came in to help me replenish my fluids and try to get some rest. My roommate got no sleep, and was excused from breakfast and morning meetings to try and get some rest himself. We had another teammate come down with the same illness during the game, where he had to post up by a garbage can for most of the game.</p>
<p>I have developed a profound respect for this virus and even would like our football team to take on a similar identity to finish out the season: Attack without warning, from all angles and leave our victim tired, weak and helpless.</p>
<p>With the final week of the CFL regular season left to decide the fate of all but the Montreal Alouettes (who have clinched first place in the East Division) and Toronto Argonauts (out of the playoffs), there will be some very hungry, vicious and unrelenting teams battling it out:</p>
<p>Edmonton at B.C.</p>
<p>(Friday, 9:30 p.m.)</p>
<p>A handshake agreement to tie prior to the game would ensure that both teams make the playoffs with 17 points apiece, sending Edmonton to the East crossover. The likelihood of that is somewhere between slim and none. This is literally an old-school Battle Royale, with the last man standing getting set to play in the West semifinal, and the losers becoming Hamilton Tiger-Cats fans on Sunday.</p>
<p>Montreal at Toronto</p>
<p>(Saturday, noon)</p>
<p>Coincidentally, these two teams square off in the Irrelevant Bowl. Or is it? With 14 wins already, the Als have tied their franchise-best record, set in 2004. This win would put Marc Trestman's 2009 squad on top with 15. On the flip side, the Argonauts aren't just going to roll over and die on their home field. This is the last chance this squad has to prove its worth to the fans and the organization before a long off-season.</p>
<p>Hamilton at Winnipeg</p>
<p>(Sunday, 1 p.m.)</p>
<p>Winnipeg wins, and it is in the playoffs with no West team crossing over.</p>
<p>Hamilton will be fighting to host the East semifinal and give its fans a long-awaited and well-deserved playoff game.</p>
<p>Calgary at Saskatchewan</p>
<p>(Saturday, 6 p.m.)</p>
<p>Full-out brawl. To the victor, the spoils: A week off, two guaranteed playoff cheques, home-field advantage in the West final -- one win away from competing in the Grey Cup in Calgary. It's kind of a big deal.</p>

<p>On behalf of our 17-month-old son, Graeme, we would like to commend the Regina Qu'Appelle Health District for the really good job it did with the first day of H1N1 vaccination for children.</p>
<p>Although a large number of people showed up on the first day, it was clear that much thought had been put into how to organize things to move the line quickly. When we arrived around 9 a.m., the line stretched for a few blocks, but once the doors opened, things moved quickly.</p>
<p>There were lots of volunteers on hand to guide people along, information sheets were handed out in the line and consent forms were provided before you reached the registration desks, to allow them to be completed by the time you reached that area. The volunteers were both kind and friendly and the nurses quietly efficient.</p>
<p>Thank you so much for all the work and thought you put into the organization and for helping a lot of worried parents and grandparents get through the line quickly.</p>
<p>By the time we left, the line-up outside the building had been entirely eliminated.</p>

<p>With the column, Sask.'s vaccination protocol a pain (SP, Oct. 30), John Gormley used the H1N1 vaccine fiasco, completely the fault of his federal Conservatives, to slag Saskatchewan people for about the 500th time.</p>
<p>We should be pushier and make noise, and shouldn't do things in a sensible, organized manner. Why, look at Alberta! It has 1,100 sites busily vaccinating anyone who shows up!</p>
<p>The next day The StarPhoenix reported that Alberta has shut down all its vaccinations sites. Bummer.</p>
<p>Oh well, never let the facts get in the way of a good diatribe. Does Gormley ever get tired of being wrong?</p>

<p>What a relief. Now that our children have received their first vaccination against the H1N1 flu virus, my wife and I can stop scanning medical websites, treating friends and family with suspicion and peeking into the kids' rooms at night to see if they're still breathing.</p>
<p>The following is an account of the events leading up to Tuesday's flu shot for three-year-old Angelina and seven-month-old Taras.</p>
<p>MONDAY</p>
<p>8 p.m.: We check Saskatoon Health Region websites. Clinics open tomorrow morning. If the lineup at Prairieland Park is too long, can we drive to Rosthern or another town offering the shots?</p>
<p>9 p.m.: My wife, Michelle, prints the consent forms from the Saskatchewan Health website. The site incorrectly states children with any severe allergies should not get the shot. Angelina has a potentially fatal allergy to dairy products, so we call the provincial health telephone line, which is likely swamped with calls from nervous parents like us. After a 45-minute wait, the nurse assures us Angelina will be fine. The warning only applies to those with severe allergies to eggs and previous flu vaccines.</p>
<p>TUESDAY</p>
<p>11:30 a.m.: The four of us get in line outside Prairieland Park. The lineup is about 200 metres long. The lineup may be shorter later in the week, but we'd be stressed keeping the kids home all day. Good thing Michelle has them bundled like snowmen.</p>
<p>11:35 a.m.: A pair of MD Ambulance employees offer those in line a hot coffee.</p>
<p>11:50 a.m.: Everyone is directed into another hall. No more outdoor waits for anyone.</p>
<p>12 p.m.: As we zig-zag through the hall lineup, we keep seeing old friends. Like us, they became hermits after having kids. Instead of bumping into them at a restaurant or movie theatre or pool hall, it's in a vaccination lineup with our kids. We're getting old.</p>
<p>12:20 p.m.: Michelle reads a book to Angelina and the girl in line behind us. I try to give Taras some food. He's having too much fun staring at the other kids to pay attention.</p>
<p>12:30 p.m.: We're directed to a registration clerk, then to a waiting area where we watch a six-minute video about the process.</p>
<p>12:40 p.m.: We're herded to one of more than a dozen tables in the main area. A pair of nurses loads the needle while making small talk. "Most kids cry, so don't worry if that happens," she said. I hold Taras and the girls sit at the other end of the table. I'm not bothered when I'm the one getting a needle, but I wince and look away as the nurse sticks the needle in my son's leg. After a momentary silence, the nurse makes a face at Taras and he laughs. Angelina, infinitely more self-aware than her young brother, holds back tears as she curls up briefly in mom's lap.</p>
<p>1 p.m.: We wait in a recovery area for 15 minutes. Other than mildly sore limbs, the kids seem fine. We're in the car headed home 90 minutes after getting in line. Nap time.</p>

<p>More than 100 businesses in Saskatoon and Regina -- including a number of provincial Crown corporations -- have hired a private company to vaccinate employees and their families for the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The development raises ethical questions around issues such as queue-jumping and private companies profiting from a vaccine that's supposed to be free.</p>
<p>"I don't understand it. This seems to be opportunistic," said Steven Lewis, a Saskatoon health policy expert and owner of Access Consulting.</p>
<p>Health regions in Saskatoon and Regina have agreed to provide thousands of doses of H1N1 vaccine to Saskatoon-based company HealthServ, company CEO and president Arlene Jorgenson said in an interview Tuesday.</p>
<p>HealthServ will send private nurses to administer the vaccine in workplaces, Jorgenson said. Employees of certain Crowns and their family members were scheduled for vaccination beginning Nov. 16, although health officials say that will likely be delayed.</p>
<p>The clinics for other selected workplaces will follow the Crowns, Jorgenson said. Any employer with at least 20 people to vaccinate can contract HealthServ, she said.</p>
<p>Jorgenson said her registered nurses can do far higher volumes -- as many as 40 per hour -- than those at general clinics run by the health region. That's because the employees are in low-risk categories and have usually read the consent and education material beforehand.</p>
<p>"Our clinics will be very efficient," she said.</p>
<p>"These workers are citizens of the province of Saskatchewan. They'd be lining up anyway at general clinics."</p>
<p>Dr. Ross Findlater, one of the Saskatoon Health Region's chief medical health officers, admits there "are significant ethical issues" around the distribution of the vaccine.</p>
<p>He notes the health region has been in talks with private providers but has not signed any contract. He said the private vaccine clinics will not open until the vaccine is available to the general public, which will not be for at least a couple of weeks. But having a private company vaccinating could shorten lineups at the public clinics, he said.</p>
<p>"It would be of some benefit to us, (but) we have to think it through carefully," Findlater said.</p>
<p>HealthServ is scheduled to immunize employees and their families at The Western Producer newspaper on Nov. 25.</p>
<p>"I'd rather see folks in as simplified a process as possible. I've got a business to run," said publisher Ken Zacharias.</p>
<p>Zacharias said his two children have recovered from a bout of H1N1, and he doesn't want to see his employees suffer through it, too. He said the employee drug plan will cover most of the costs of the program.</p>
<p>Lewis said even if workplace clinics aren't held any sooner than those for the general public, the lineups will likely be much shorter. That's equivalent to paying for faster service.</p>
<p>"It's a form of queue-jumping," he said.</p>

<p>More than 1,500 people received H1N1 vaccinations Tuesday in Saskatoon, the first day of a massive public clinic at Prairieland Park.</p>
<p>The clinic continues today and for the rest of the week between 10 a.m. and 8 p.m. for those deemed to be at highest risk -- kids at least six months and less than five years old, pregnant women (greater than 20 weeks) and women four weeks postpartum.</p>
<p>Also Tuesday, the provincial government announced the vaccination will be expanded across the province later this week and next to include children from kindergarten to Grade 6.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon public school board heard Tuesday night that discussions will take place today around which schools will have H1N1 clinics in them. Deputy director of education Avon Whittles said clinics may be starting in schools as early as next week.</p>
<p>"The science is showing us since H1N1 appeared in the spring that this age group is at a higher risk for illness and hospitalization," said Saskatchewan's chief medical health officer, Dr. Moira McKinnon. "We will continue to expand vaccinations to targeted high-risk groups as the vaccine becomes available."</p>
<p>Schools will send home consent forms for parents to sign before their child can receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>At Prairieland Park, hundreds of parents and their young children lined up hours before sunrise Tuesday, although the line had dwindled by late afternoon.</p>
<p>Even though doors to the makeshift clinic didn't open until 10 a.m., people were in line before 6 a.m. Wearing parkas and hoods, mittens and boots, those waiting were generally in good spirits, resigned to the fact the process was going to take some time.</p>
<p>Bennett Armstrong, age four, stood outside with his mother, Tammy, and grandmother, Virginia Roberts, for more than one hour before getting through the doors to the building, where they still had to queue behind more than 200 others.</p>
<p>"The benefit outweighs the risk. You've got to follow the advice of those who know," said Tammy Armstrong.</p>
<p>"I don't want him to get (H1N1 flu)," added Roberts.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region was ready to immunize up to 4,000 children on Tuesday, based on the number of nurses and support staff scheduled to work at the clinic on its first day.</p>
<p>Once parents and children made it to the front of the line, they were instructed to fill out information and consent forms.</p>
<p>They were then escorted into a screening room to watch a six-minute video describing the process. Next, they were led into a large room where nurses and other health workers administered the vaccine. Finally, they were led to a recovery room where they watched another short video.</p>
<p>The facility also has rooms to screen children who are experiencing flu-like symptoms or other illnesses to see if they are able to vaccinated. There is also a separate room for mothers to breastfeed on-site.</p>
<p>The mass clinic at Prairieland Park is meant to serve the majority of city residents, while a series of smaller clinics have been scheduled for those living in core neighbourhoods -- King George, Meadowgreen, Pleasant Hill, Riversdale and Westmount.</p>
<p>The clinic at Prairieland is expected to operate daily as long as demand continues and the supply of vaccine holds out.</p>
<p>About 172,000 doses of the vaccine have been distributed to regional health authorities.</p>
<p>Dr. Johnmark Opondo, Saskatoon Health Region deputy medical health officer, said the region's emergency rooms and medical clinics are seeing a significant increase in patients with flu-like symptoms, although most are presenting with mild forms.</p>
<p>"Getting your vaccine now is important," he said, noting flu viruses can become more severe without notice.</p>
<p>At least five schools with Greater Saskatoon Catholic Schools had at least 10 per cent of their students out sick Tuesday.</p>
<p>According to the division, which electronically tallies sick student absences daily, about six schools were around the 10 per cent absentee rate last week. When a school hits the 10 per cent mark, it is supposed to report that to public health officials and send a letter home to parents.</p>
<p>There were no Catholic elementary school classes Monday, but on Tuesday, the division heard from administrators at five schools who estimated about 15 per cent of their students were sick.</p>
<p>Many of the illnesses are believed to be H1N1, but that isn't the only factor -- one school was dealing with a cluster of chicken pox cases last week.</p>
<p>Saskatoon Public Schools' spokesperson Joy Adams Bauer said 34 of the division's 55 schools had more than 10 per cent of students home sick Monday. Many schools have sick absentee rates in the low teens, but others have 20 per cent or more of the students off sick. The absentee rates include all illnesses, not just H1N1.</p>

<p>Organizers of the world junior hockey championships are inviting former Saskatchewan residents to come home for the holidays.</p>
<p>"Come Home to Saskatchewan and Experience the World's Best Hockey Holiday" is a new campaign, launched Tuesday. The IIHF 2010 World Junior Championships are in Saskatoon and Regina Dec. 20 to Jan. 5.</p>
<p>John Lee, senior vice-president and Regina chair of the host organizing committee, said that while ticket sales are "going very well," organizers hope the new promotion will fill the stands and attract more visitors to the province.</p>
<p>"We want to sell all the games out to give hockey teams that are here from all over the country a real experience," Lee told reporters.</p>
<p>He said ticket sales have increased significantly within the last two weeks. While he couldn't provide exact figures, overall ticket sales are at about 70 to 75 per cent.</p>
<p>"The last week or two weeks, we've sold over 3,000 packages and somewhere around 17,000 tickets. We're really pleased where we're at right now," he added. Lee noted the six-game package in particular is being marketed to those from Alberta and Manitoba because they can come to the province for two to three hockey-filled days.</p>
<p>Last month, organizers said there had been more than $10 million in ticket sales, of a potential $17-million gross if every ticket is sold.</p>
<p>Enterprise Minister Ken Cheveldayoff, a senior vice-president on the host organizing committee, said the province is anticipating about $25 million to $30 million in economic spin-offs. "Every hotel in Regina and Saskatoon and surrounding area will be full. And there'll be spin-offs for restaurants and rental cars and all kinds of ancillary activity."</p>
<p>Cheveldayoff said concerns about H1N1 and its potential impact on the games are being taken seriously.</p>
<p>"Any type of health aspect -- teams bring their own physicians. They get special allowances to practice medicine in the province ... the Ministry of Tourism, Parks, Culture and Sport is working with other government departments to ensure that we're on top of H1N1 and anything else that may come along."</p>
<p>An electronic invitation for out-of-province guests is available on websites: www.sasktourism.com[http://www.sasktourism.com], www.tourismsaskatoon.com[http://www.tourismsaskatoon.com], and www.reginaroc.com[http://www.reginaroc.com].</p>

<p>Question: If I think I have had the swine flu but it hasn't been confirmed by a blood test or other medical means, should I still get the flu shot?</p>
<p>Answer: Health authorities are encouraging all individuals to obtain a H1N1 vaccination. There are no adverse effects if someone with a prior H1N1 infection receives the vaccine. High-risk individuals (such as the immunocompromised) who may have previously had the H1N1 disease are encouraged to discuss with their physician their individual health condition and risks of not being vaccinated.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan could start offering school-age children from kindergarten to Grade 6 the H1N1 vaccine as early as Friday, says the province's chief medical officer, Dr. Moira McKinnon.</p>
<p>"The next priority group is children from kindergarten to Grade 6, inclusive,'' McKinnon told reporters on Tuesday.</p>
<p>"There are many factors leading towards this decision -- the availability of the vaccine, the high rate of hospitalization in this group and the recent increase in pediatric deaths in the U.S.''</p>
<p>Children under the age of 15 have five times the hospitalizations of any other age group and, in the U.S. at the moment, there is an increase in pediatric deaths, she added.</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region will not be rolling out the school immunization program until Monday because a number of schools in the region are closed Friday, said RQHR spokesman Mark Torjusen. He added the H1N1 flu shots for this age group will only be offered through the schools, which will send out consent forms and notifications to parents.</p>
<p>McKinnon assured reporters the province has enough vaccine to continue vaccinating the designated high-risk groups -- health-care workers, remote and isolated and other First Nations communities, children six months to less than five years, pregnant women of more than 20 weeks gestation and less than 20 weeks if high risk, and women up to four weeks post-partum -- and will continue expanding the risk groups as more vaccine becomes available.</p>
<p>"Take-up (of the H1N1 flu shot) has been very high and we are pleased with the turnout and the acceptance of the vaccine,'' she added.</p>
<p>"By the middle of next week, we will have vaccinated 22 per cent of the Saskatchewan public, all in the high-risk category.''</p>
<p>To date, approximately 172,000 doses of the vaccine have been distributed to regional health authorities, and another 14,000 doses of adjuvanted vaccine and a shipment of approximately 8,000 Australian unadjuvanted doses are expected this week.</p>
<p>The new supply of adjuvanted vaccine, combined with left-over batches from the infant to pre-schooler program -- children under 10 only need half a dose to acquire protection against the virus -- will mean that there is enough vaccine to cover the latest targeted group -- an estimated 70,000 school-age children, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>The vaccine will be delivered in a combination of school and community clinics, and will be rolled out starting as early as Friday and into next week as health regions wind up their current immunization clinics. Notices and consent forms will be sent home through the schools.</p>
<p>As for providing booster shots for children under 10, McKinnon said, it is know that the first half dose of the vaccine provides a high level of protection, but the longevity of that protection is unknown.</p>
<p>While it is still recommended they get another dose in three weeks, that may change and one dose may be all that is required, depending on the findings of U.S. and European drug trials expected in the next couple of weeks, she said.</p>
<p>The province has to take a measured approach to rolling out its immunization program based on the availability of vaccine, she said, asking for the general public to be patient and understanding.</p>

<p>The federal department charged with disaster planning is itself a disaster when it comes to preparing for emergencies as varied as the swine flu pandemic, floods and terrorist attacks, says Auditor General Sheila Fraser.</p>
<p>"We found that Public Safety Canada has not exercised the leadership necessary to co-ordinate emergency management activities," Fraser concluded in her latest report, tabled in the House of Commons on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Her department did not study the current H1N1 crisis, but Fraser believes that had Public Safety Canada put pandemic management plans in place, there would have been less confusion.</p>
<p>"Certainly an approved plan would have clearly indicated what the role was for Public Safety Canada, what the roles of the other departments and the federal government would be, and would also have brought in the co-ordination with the provinces, municipalities and territories," Fraser told reporters.</p>
<p>"So it's important -- very important -- that the role and responsibilities of Public Safety Canada be agreed to and endorsed in these emergencies."</p>
<p>The opposition parties seized on Fraser's findings in the House of Commons question period, blaming the long lineups for H1N1 immunizations and a vaccine shortage of the Conservative government's failure to have an organized plan.</p>
<p>"Doesn't that begin to explain why the government's response to this crisis has been so slow and so confused?" charged Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff.</p>
<p>The Conservatives were also hammered for relying on a sole manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, for the vaccine. The federal government is responsible for buying the vaccine and distributing it to the provinces.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan replied that the government has a separate pandemic management plan in place, overseen by Health Canada, that should not be confused with the Public Safety Department's more general role to oversee national disasters.</p>
<p>He stressed that the federal government only plays a co-ordinating role in emergency preparedness and that disaster and emergency management "is primarily a provincial issue."</p>
<p>In her report, Fraser highlighted not only H1N1, but also severe acute respiratory syndrome, the 2003 eastern seaboard power blackout, massive flooding and terrorist threats as examples of emergencies that fall under the co-ordination of the Department of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p>The department, which was created in 2003, has yet to finalize a Federal Emergency Response Plan and appears to be offering no guidance to other federal departments in developing their own sub-plans, the auditor concluded.</p>
<p>Fraser was also critical of Citizenship and Immigration Canada after her auditors found that some temporary workers are getting into Canada after work permits have been issued for jobs or employers that do not exist.</p>
<p>Fraser's auditors also said they were disappointed to find that there was no evidence that changes the governing Conservatives made to Canada's immigration system were helping to meet Canada's skills shortages. Moreover, the temporary foreign worker program is inefficient and ineffective and that could leave foreign workers in a vulnerable position.</p>
<p>Fraser also looked at four procurement projects that were "fast-tracked" at the Defence Department to get urgently needed tanks and armoured vehicles to the front lines in Afghanistan. Fraser found that in three of the projects, the new gear got to the soldiers in time but the paperwork was not handled correctly. The fourth project, involving a weapons system for a light armoured vehicle, is running at least double its original $55-million budget and is nearly two years behind schedule.</p>
<p>Fraser's audit said Public Safety Canada's emergency preparedness arm is plagued with staff shortages and inexperience, with a 39 per cent staff vacancy rate in 2008-09 and 50 per cent the previous year.</p>
<p>"The department had difficulty in attracting and retaining senior managers to provide the direction that is needed in its senior management," the audit said.</p>
<p>"Turnover and change of staff has been particularly problematic."</p>
<p>Fraser also handed out a rare gold star to Canada Health Infoway, concluding that the non-profit foundation which is involved in "the national development of electronic health records" and which has received $1.2 billion in federal funding since its creation in 2001 was well-managed.</p>

<p>Ottawa --</p>
<p>The federal department that is supposed to guide Canada through pandemics, natural disasters and terrorist attacks is failing to assume its proper role and show that it acts as the lead authority in times of crisis, the Auditor-General said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Public Safety Canada has not exercised the leadership necessary to co-ordinate emergency management activities, including critical infrastructure protection in Canada,” Sheila Fraser said in a report to Parliament.</p>
<p>As it stands, the federal government reacts to matters such as the H1N1 pandemic or major blackouts on a “case-by-case basis,” eight years after the 9/11 terrorist attacks highlighted the need for better responses to emergencies.</p>
<p>While massive floods or cyber-attacks have a “low probability of occurrence,” the government has to be ready given their “high potential impact,” the report said.</p>
<p>However, the government has yet to thoroughly determine the critical infrastructure that needs to be protected in Canada, with Natural Resources Canada and Public Safety Canada both working in parallel to map the country's strategic resources.</p>
<p>Ms. Fraser said that Public Safety Canada has yet to develop a clear plan to tackle major crises in Canada.</p>
<p>“Until it is clearly established how Public Safety Canada will work with other departments, it will be difficult for it to truly co-ordinate the federal response to emergency situations,” Ms. Fraser told reporters.</p>
<p>“Canada needs to have a planned and co-ordinated approach in place so that federal, provincial and municipal agencies know what part they will play in managing a crisis.”</p>
<p>The Auditor-General found that Ottawa's Federal Emergency Response Plan has yet to be formally endorsed by the government.</p>
<p>“To be able to respond effectively to large-scale emergencies and reduce the potential loss of life and property damage, there needs to be extensive planning and co-ordination,” the report said.</p>
<p>Ottawa called for an “all-hazards approach” in 2004, meaning it said it had to be prepared to respond to any emergency, regardless of whether the cause was natural, accidental or malicious.</p>
<p>Public Safety Canada has had problems meetings its goals, given high turnover in its senior ranks. In the previous fiscal year, there was a 39-per cent vacancy rate among senior managers.</p>

<p>Behind today's headlines - Stories Report on Business is following:</p>
<p>Buffett buys a railroad</p>
<p>Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. struck its biggest deal ever this morning, a $26-billion (U.S.) takeover of Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. Why does Mr. Buffett, the Oracle of Omaha, want with a railroad? "It's an all-in wager on the economic future of the United States," he said. "I love these bets." The way Mr. Buffett sees it, railroads will grow as the United States grows, and more people will move goods over the course of the next three decades. The deal – $100 a share in cash and stock for the 77.4 per cent of the railroad Berkshire doesn't already own – is boosting railroad stocks in premarket trading.

<p>Britain shakes up its banking sector</p>
<p>A shakeup of Britain's banking sector sent jitters through the markets this morning, raising fears again over the stability of the global financial sector. The country's two biggest lenders, Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group, are selling big chunks of their branches and key units. The moves are necessary to settle issues with European Union antitrust regulators over receiving government aid. Both banks, once global European champions, are partly owned by the British government. The moves are significant. Lloyds announced a record share issue of more than $22-billion (U.S.), and said it would pull out of the government's insurance program for bad debt. RBS will sell parts of its retail network and insurance arm, and scale back its investment banking unit. Both have agreed to curbs on bonuses. Lloyds is also selling branches. Another huge charge booked by UBS AG of Switzerland also spooked the markets. RBS chief executive officer Stephen Hester said the bank feels "bruised by what we've had to go through." Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/britain-shakes-up-its-banks/article1349193/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/britain-shakes-up-its-banks/article1349193/])</p>
<p>Oops, they did it again</p>
<p>Australia, which surprised the markets a month ago with the first interest rate hike among major economies, boosted rates by another quarter of a percentage point today, hiking its benchmark rate to 3.5 per cent. The Reserve Bank of Australia, though, sent a signal that it may not hike again at its next meeting in December. While today's rate hike could be seen in some quarters as putting the heat on other central banks to follow suit, that scenario is unlikely. The Federal Reserve begins a two-day meeting today, with its policy announcement Wednesday, followed by the European Central Bank and Bank of England on Thursday. Those central banks, in far different positions than their Australian counterpart, which never saw a recession during the global slump, are far from tightening monetary policy at this point.</p>
<p>There has been some speculation in markets that the Bank of Canada could follow Australia, given the similarities of the Canadian and Australian economies. But that's not likely to happen. More likely is that Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney will, all things being equal, stick to his promise to keep rates at historic lows well into next year.</p>
<p>"While Australia and Canada both have a vast supply of commodities, the similarities stop there," Scotia Capital economists said in a note this morning. "For one, Australia's major export market is Asia, with about 20 per cent of its exports heading to China, while only 5 per cent are exported to the U.S. And, the IMF just raised its Chinese GDP projection for 2010 to 9 per cent. Canada, on the other hand, sends 75 per cent of its exports to the U.S. with only 3 per cent heading to China. This means Canada is more heavily exposed to our double-dip fears and only faces about a 3 per cent expansion in economic activity in the U.S. in 2010."

<p>Ferrari aims for China markets</p>
<p>China's fortunes certainly are changing. The emerging economic powerhouse has been forging ahead on all fronts, buying resources around the world and putting its stamp on several industries. Now, Ferrari, the luxury car unit of Fiat, says China should become one of its top five markets within a few years. Marco Mattiacci, its Asia-Pacific CEO, told the Reuters news agency today Ferrari is marketing to the ever increasing ranks of China's wealthy, planning to sell about 600 cars a year over the next five years. The U.S. is still its biggest market, but, Mr. Mattiacci said, China is rich with potential.</p>
<p>Eastern Europe hit hard</p>
<p>Bit by bit, Europe is emerging from recession, though its eastern nations largely remain troubled. A European Union forecast this morning noted that Poland will be the lone EU country to escape a recession, while Estonia, Latvia, Hungary and Lithuania will be hit hard. The projection also noted that, but for Estonia and Bulgaria, the eastern countries will rack up budget deficits above the EU's mandated 3-per-cent level.</p>
<p>Lookahead: U.S. factory orders for September will be reported at 10 a.m. ET.</p>
<p>Talisman hit by tumbling energy prices</p>
<p>Tumbling energy prices continue to hit the oil patch. Talisman Energy Inc. said this morning its third-quarter profit fell 98 per cent to $30-million or 3 cents a share from $1.43-billion or $1.38. Given that the Calgary-based energy company's business is fairly evenly split between oil and gas, it was hit by both lower oil prices and collapsing natural gas prices. Revenue fell to $1.54-billion from $2.66-billion.</p>
<p>Addicted to the Internet</p>
<p>As technology evolves, so do our afflictions. Bloomberg News reports this morning that Rome's Policlinico Gemelli hospital has opened a new clinic to treat Internet Addiction Disorder, or the obsessive need to be online. The symptoms - anxiety and depression when not logged in, among others - were first identified by psychiatrist Ivan Goldberg in the mid-1990s. Now, there are similar centres in the U.S., China and Japan, one close to Microsoft's headquarters in Washington state. "Many of the patients have interpersonal problems: They don't talk to their neighbours and hardly go out, but are online all night to chat with someone in, say, Nepal," one of the psychologists at the Rome clinic told the news agency.</p>

<p>Today's top stories from Report on Business:</p>
<p>Buffett's Berkshire to buy railroad</p>
<p>Warren Buffett is getting into the railway business with his biggest takeover ever. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc. struck a $34-billion (U.S.) deal today to acquire Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp. , offering $100 a share in cash and stock for about 80 per cent of the railroad it does not already own. It's a big bet on the future of the American economy, given that Burlington Northern, the second-biggest U.S. railway, hauls everything from corn to coal and is thus an indicator of the country's health. Analysts said Mr. Buffett is seeking an investment that will bring rewards for years, and that he's not as concerned about immediate returns. He is, said one analyst “buying at the trough – things aren't going to get much worse.” Mr. Buffett said more people will move more goods over the next three decades, and he sees the U.S. prospering. Mr. Buffett, known as the Oracle of Omaha, described the deal as an “all-in wager of the economic future of the United States. I love these bets.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/buffetts-berkshire-to-buy-railroad/article1349275/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-investor/buffetts-berkshire-to-buy-railroad/article1349275/])</p>
<p>How investors can buy in to Buffett</p>
<p>Small investors are about to get their best chance yet to buy into Mr. Buffett's wisdom. To accommodate the railway deal, under which Burlington shareholders can opt for Berkshire shares, his company will split its Class B shares 50-to-1. That means holders of the Berkshire Bs will get 50 new shares for each they now own. These shares are known as “baby Bs” because of their lower trading price compared with Berkshire A shares. Of course, even the babies are worth several thousand dollars. With the upcoming split, they will be worth far less individually. As yet, there's no timetable for the split.

<p>GM scuttles Magna's Opel deal</p>
<p>Frank Stronach's vision of turning Magna International Inc. into a full-fledged auto maker has evaporated after General Motors Co. decided to hang on to the European subsidiary. GM said in a statement late Tuesday that its board agreed to retain the European business given the improving environment for GM over the past few months and the importance of Opel to the auto maker. The GM move followed months of negotiations that ended with a deal for Magna and its Russian partner Sberbank to acquire 55 per cent of Opel.

<p>Gold jumps to fresh record as India buys bullion</p>
<p>Gold prices jumped to a record after India's central bank bought 200 tonnes of bullion from the International Monetary Fund. The $6.7-billion (U.S.) sale to the Reserve Bank of India was half of the IMF's long-planned bullion sale. Analysts said the deal will relieve the gold market of some uncertainty about how and when the IMF would sell about one-eighth of its total gold stock, and the deal fuelled speculation that other central banks, possibly China's, may also be ready to diversify their reserves. Traders said the IMF sale could help support bullion prices. “Gold was kept off the market and sold directly to central banks so potential sales on market are limited by this,” said one analyst.

<p>Britain shakes up its banking industry</p>
<p>Britain's two largest retail banks secured another £31-billion ($50.5-billion U.S.) from the government Tuesday and agreed to sell branches and key businesses to appease EU competition concerns about state aid. Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group also accepted drastic caps on bankers' bonuses in deals that pave the way for Britain to begin selling the bank stakes it bought during the crisis, a crucial source of money as the country struggles with a ballooning budget deficit. Lloyds also freed itself from a government insurance scheme for bad debts by raising £13.5-billion in the world's largest-ever rights issue. That left RBS, already Britain's whipping boy in the banking crisis blame game, as the only bank taking up the government's Asset Protection Scheme and accepting the most punitive disposals.

<p>Vehicle sales in Canada, U.S. recover from depths</p>
<p>Vehicle sales in Canada and the United States are recovering from the depths hit earlier this year but the pace of the turnaround is slow and bypassing some key companies. Sales fell 1 per cent in Canada last month and were roughly flat in the U.S. market. That’s the best combined performance in the two countries since the auto crisis began last fall, with the exception of the Washington’s cash for clunkers incentive scheme that artificially boosted U.S. sales in July and August. A 33 per cent slide at General Motors of Canada Ltd. kept Canadian sales from jumping into positive territory for the first time this year, while a 30 per cent plunge in Chrysler Group LLC’s U.S. sales was the worst performance among the Detroit Three.</p>
<p>Australia hikes interest rates again</p>
<p>The Reserve Bank of Australia boosted interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point for the second month in a row, but was careful not to fuel expectations for another rate hike next month. Australia, whose central bank's benchmark rate now stands at 3.5 per cent, escaped a recession during the global meltdown and its fortunes have far exceeded those of other countries. The move will not likely spur other major banks to follow suit. The Federal Reserve, which began a two-day meeting today, is not expected to change interest rates when it announces its decision Wednesday afternoon. Nor are the European Central Bank and Bank of England when they meet Thursday. Currency traders have also speculated that the Bank of Canada could follow Australia given the similarities of the two economies – speculation that tends to boost the Canadian dollar – but economists have also ruled that out. Rather, Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney is seen sticking to his pledge to keep rates at historic lows well into next year.

<p>Surging gold prices and a rebound in technology heavyweight Research In Motion propelled the Toronto Stock Exchange to strong afternoon gains, as the Canadian market posted its second-strongest session in the past six weeks. Stocks in New York were mixed, as concerns about the banking sector and U.S. employment prospects were offset by generally encouraging earnings reports.

<p>Johnson & Johnson slashes work force</p>
<p>Johnson & Johnson its trimming the ranks of its management, cutting thousands of jobs and planning other restructuring moves in a bid to save up to $900-million (U.S.) next year. The health products manufacturer said the cuts will affect 6 or 7 per cent of its global work force, or more than 8,000 jobs. The layoffs will cost the company a restructuring charge of up to $1.3-billion pretax in the fourth quarter. Chief executive officer William C. Weldon said the restructuring is based on a broad, global view of the changing health care industry.

<p>Investing: What is RIM stock worth?</p>
<p>Analysts are looking at the same numbers, but drawing vastly different conclusions about the future of Research In Motion Ltd. . In the latest flurry of analysis of the BlackBerry maker, two investment firms today published research notes, one rating RIM a $50 (U.S.) stock and a “sell,” and the other deeming it at $100 stock and a “buy.” Both bulls and bears on the company agree that a wave of new competition is about to hit the wireless handset market, but they differ in the assessment of how RIM will weather it.

<p>Aeroplan expands into U.S.</p>
<p>Groupe Aeroplan Inc. is expanding its business into the United States with the $188-million purchase of Carlson Marketing, a U.S.-based provider of loyalty marketing services. Aeroplan, the loyalty program company spun off from Air Canada, said the acquisition of the private company from U.S. hotel and travel firm Carlson companies Inc., is another step in its international expansion strategy. Aeroplan says Carlson will be run as a separate division.</p>
<p>Space hotel: The final frontier</p>
<p>A company behind plans to open the first hotel in space says it is on target to accept its first paying guests in 2012 despite critics questioning the investment and time frame for the multibillion-dollar project. The Barcelona-based architects of the Galactic Suite Space Resort say it will cost €3-million ($4.4 million U.S.) for a three-night stay at the hotel, with this price including an eight-week training course on a tropical island. During their stay, guests would see the sun rise 15 times a day and travel around the world every 80 minutes. They would wear Velcro suits so they could crawl around their pod rooms, sticking themselves to the walls like Spiderman. A nascent space tourism industry is beginning to take shape with construction under way in New Mexico of Spaceport America, the world's first facility built specifically for space-bound commercial customers and fee-paying passengers. British tycoon Richard Branson's space tours firm, Virgin Galactic, will use the facility to propel tourists into suborbital space at a cost of $200,000 a ride. More than 200 people have expressed an interest in travelling to the space hotel and at least 43 people have reserved.</p>

</p>
<p>Two confirmed cases of H1N1 flu - and five other probable cases - on the Waterloo Warriors women's hockey team have pushed the Ontario University Athletics' new pandemic policy into practice for the first time.</p>
<p>The conference postponed a pair of Warriors games this weekend, at York University and the University of Toronto, because of the illnesses.</p>
<p>The OUA's strategy is based on prevention using Health Canada guidelines, said Ward Dilse, the OUA's executive director.</p>
<p>"We are addressing this on a case-by-base basis. This one was pretty clear because of the number of people affected."</p>
<p>Dilse said the postponement of conference games would get more complicated if the teams involved are participating in playoff games since those are often qualifiers for set-in-stone national championships.</p>
<p>Conference Final Four games in football and men's and women's soccer are scheduled this weekend.</p>
<p>The OUA has also urged its member institutions to have hand sanitizer readily available to student-athletes and to avoid shared water bottles. However, it stopped short of advising teams to get vaccinated or of halting post-game handshakes.</p>
<p>Younger persons, including varsity athletes, are considered more vulnerable to the effects of H1N1 according to medical experts, though deaths are rare.</p>
<p>"This will be a learning exercise for us. We don't have any past practice to draw upon," Dilse said.</p>
<p>At Wilfrid Laurier University, student-athletes have reported many cases of flu-like symptoms, though there have been no confirmed cases of H1N1 as of Monday, said athletic director Peter Baxter.</p>
<p>Seven players missed the Golden Hawks football practice on Sunday due to illness.</p>
<p>Barry MacLean, WLU's soccer coach, said his women's team has battled flu symptoms all season.</p>
<p>Members of UW's swim and men's rugby teams have also been hit with similar symptoms.</p>
<p>An assistant coach with UW's women's hockey team said dealing with H1N1 is the new normal for many teams.</p>
<p>"I'm sure there's been lots of other teams to have had the flu this season, but maybe not as severe as us," Jerry Harrigan said.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping everyone is back in time for this weekend's games. But by then, we could have another seven players down with the flu."</p>
<p>UW's flu-stricken hockey players were diagnosed Wednesday on campus, sent home and were expected to return to classes on Monday, Harrigan said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Traffic snarls as historic bridge reopens</b>

</p>
<p>KITCHENER</p>
<p>The historic Bridgeport bridge reopened to traffic Monday morning after a season of reconstruction.</p>
<p>Right away this caused a massive traffic jam.</p>
<p>"We're sorry about it," said Greg Proctor, manager of bridge reconstruction. Vehicles coming over the renovated bridge overwhelmed the nearby intersection at Bridge Street and University Avenue in Waterloo. Traffic backed up more than a kilometre, all the way back over the bridge.</p>
<p>Authorities had adjusted traffic signals ahead of time, but not by enough. More adjustments were made Monday.</p>
<p>However, Proctor warns that some traffic headaches may continue all week at Bridge and University. It's the fallout of a complicated $12-million regional government project that's concluding in tricky stages.</p>
<p>This week, traffic will use one lane on the original bridge and one lane on the temporary bridge beside it. Splitting traffic onto two bridges is necessary to complete the new roundabout at Bridge and Lancaster streets, which is only partly open.</p>
<p>The roundabout is expected to open completely next week. It will provide drivers with more options. Both lanes are also expected to open on the Bridgeport bridge over the Grand River.</p>
<p>Some other traffic disruptions will follow, while crews complete storm sewers, complete final roundabout paving, and remove the temporary bridge.</p>
<p>There are high hopes for Bridgeport when the complex project finally concludes.</p>
<p>"Overall, we're pleased with the progress that has been made," said George Kanellis, whose family runs Golf's Steak House on Lancaster Street.</p>
<p>"The bridge is fantastic."</p>
<p>The 1934 bridge has been given a major facelift. New features include a second sidewalk and replica lighting that hearkens back to its earliest days.</p>
<p>Lancaster Street has some new sidewalks. The Grand Hotel, an unsightly strip club that bothered some, is gone. It was demolished to make way for the roundabout. The site where it stood may become a canoe launch.</p>
<p>The roundabout is intended to keep traffic flowing through a chronic bottleneck. Designing it and squeezing it into a tight space has been a challenge.</p>
<p>It will open as one of the busiest roundabouts in the region.</p>
<p>Politicians are so confident it will work, they are easing a traffic-related development freeze. More than 2,000 residents could move into new homes and apartments now poised to go ahead in the Bridgeport area.</p>
<p>Kanellis figures the roundabout will improve traffic flow. He's not sure by how much.</p>
<p>His restaurant had a rough summer, losing customers to road construction fallout, the economic downturn, and now H1N1 fears.</p>
<p>But they're looking forward to a busier Christmas season, he said. And they plan to open for lunch next year, to serve people on the Grand River trail.</p>
<p>Regional Chair Ken Seiling sees brighter days ahead for Bridgeport. "I think this project is a bit of a catalyst, to see some new investment and some new development," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Region to use numbered wristbands</b>
</div><div>By Liz Monteiro   </div>

</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Residents going to local H1N1 clinics will get a numbered wristband to avoid waiting in long line-ups in the cold and rain, Dr. Liana Nolan, the region's medical officer of health said Monday.</p>
<p>Beginning this afternoon at the public health immunization clinic, numbered wristbands will be given to people as they arrive.</p>
<p>Public health officials will ask those in line one-on-one if they are in a high-risk group.</p>
<p>If they are not, they will be asked to leave, said Nolan.</p>
<p>Residents are being told not to arrive more than an hour before the clinic opens because lineups won't be allowed until then. The wristband will give residents an approximate time when they will be able to be vaccinated, she said.</p>
<p>"If the wait is long, they can go and come back,'' she said.</p>
<p>"Hopefully by using the wristband we will minimize discomfort of standing outside for hours.</p>
<p>"We wanted to improve the verification system for the people who are high risk and we were concerned about people standing for hours in the cold,'' Nolan said.</p>
<p>High risk includes those under 65 with chronic medical conditions, children six months to under five years old, pregnant women, health care workers and caregivers for people at higher risk.</p>
<p>Nolan said public health officials were relying on the honour system and "that didn't work very well'' at the region's first immunization clinic on the weekend.</p>
<p>"We were relying on people's honesty . . . now we are going to be stricter.''</p>
<p>On Saturday, people who were not in the risk group lined up to get their shot, she said.</p>
<p>"It's a question of fairness. People have been calling and complaining that we are not enforcing the priority for high-risk groups,'' she said.</p>
<p>The majority of the region's vaccine supply - more than half - has been sent to doctor's offices, Nolan said. People wanting an H1N1 vaccine should go to their family doctor first.</p>
<p>"We know we have enough for this week,'' she said.</p>
<p>Nolan said she expects 2,000 people will get vaccinated at each of the four clinics this week.</p>
<p>Nolan said a challenge for public health officials has been to estimate the demand for the vaccine.</p>
<p>"We have had to tweak our process to make it more comfortable for people,'' she said.</p>
<p>As of last Wednesday, 40 schools in the region had a 10-per-cent absenteeism rate and Nolan expects that number to go up in the next couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the Out of the Cold program, which began on Sunday, volunteers are being more cautious. Volunteer Roberta Hickey said all volunteers are being asked to wash their hands frequently, disinfect surfaces more often and wear gloves while clearing plates off tables in the dining room.</p>
<p>"We are being more cautious,'' said Hickey, who volunteers at St. John's Lutheran Church in Waterloo on Thursdays.</p>
<p>Hickey said she contacted the public health unit to find out if any special clinics would be held at the Out of the Cold locations in Kitchener-Waterloo. Hickey was told there would be no special clinics.</p>
<p>"It is a concern. Some of our guests have health issues,'' she said.</p>
<p>Hickey said she plans to wear gloves while serving dinner on Thursday. Hickey said she received a call from a volunteer who is worried about contracting the flu and may wear a mask. Hickey said the public health unit said masks were not necessary.</p>
<p>Hickey said Out of the Cold needs volunteers to stay with guests overnight from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. She said there has been a lack of volunteers at night in past years and does not attribute the problem to the H1N1 virus. The Out of the Cold program, which provides food and shelter for the homeless and the working poor, continues until the end of April.</p>

<p>Developments Monday in the ongoing H1N1 pandemic:</p>
<p>Vancouver</p>
<p>A non-profit lobby group is calling on federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq to stop private clinics from distributing the H1N1 vaccine, arguing priority flu shots are meant for everyone at high risk to contract the virus, not just people with high incomes. Michael McBane, spokesperson for the Canadian Health Coalition made the comments after learning that two private clinics, one in Vancouver and one in Toronto, have received a supply of the H1N1 vaccine. He called it "queue-jumping, plain and simple."</p>
<p>Toronto</p>
<p>Ontario Health Minister Deb Matthews says health officials aim to inoculate 2.2 million people for the H1N1 flu by the week's end. Tens of thousands of Ontario residents have already received the flu shot, she said, and the focus remains on high-priority groups.</p>
<p>Toronto</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada is rolling out its first doses of unadjuvanted H1N1 flu vaccine this week, which will help pregnant women unwilling to get the adjuvanted shot.</p>
<p>The agency has begun delivering vaccine without an adjuvant to the provinces and territories and plans to have dispersed almost 225,000 doses by week's end.</p>
<p>Halifax</p>
<p>Clinics continued to operate in Nova Scotia, but Health Minister Maureen MacDonald said there are not enough doses to immunize all that need them. The province has already administered half the doses it received from national suppliers and is only expecting 12,500 this week, MacDonald said.</p>
<p>Geneva, Switzerland</p>
<p>A medical journal says the World Health Organization's definition of a flu pandemic is too broad. The editorial, in the journal BMJ Clinical Evidence, says changes the WHO made in the definition a few years ago allow more viruses to qualify as pandemics. The editorial says before the change, a flu virus of a new subtype would be needed to cause a pandemic. A subtype is the H number in a flu virus's name, such as H1N1 or H3N2. In the latest version of the definition, the article argues, mutated viruses of an existing subtype could qualify as a pandemic, raising the risk of false alarms.</p>
<p>Kyiv, Ukraine</p>
<p>Urging its citizens not to panic, Ukraine on Monday closed the nation's schools for a week to avoid the spread of H1N1 and suggested that nightclubs, cinemas and food markets in the west also shut down.</p>
<p>Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko met a Swiss shipment of antiviral drugs at the Kyiv airport Monday.</p>
<p>President Viktor Yushchenko, said thousands of people were infected and called for assistance from NATO, the United States, Russia and other countries.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Burying a child is "the most horrific thing" for anyone to endure, the father of a 13-year-old boy who died from H1N1 said at his funeral, but he hopes the tragedy will encourage more education about the virus.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio, an otherwise healthy teen, died last Monday after complaining of symptoms at a hockey tournament on the weekend.</p>
<p>His father, Paul Frustaglio, said he, his wife Anne-Marie and son Will, 10, have been touched by the outpouring of support and stories from people who have also been affected by H1N1.</p>
<p>"It truly amazes me that Evan's death has captured a nation trying to find answers to a disease that is currently wearing the face of Evan Frustaglio," his father said during a eulogy for his eldest son.</p>
<p>"We must learn from our loss and all become educated on a disease that took our son's life."</p>
<p>The spectre of the influenza on the minds of people all across the country was present during the funeral as Father Vito Marziliano asked those gathered to eschew the tradition of shaking hands during the sign of peace. In accordance with new H1N1 flu guidelines issued Monday by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto, a nod, bow or other such gesture was encouraged.</p>
<p>During the emotional tribute in front of about 900 mourners, Frustaglio choked up several times as he shared memories of his "best friend."</p>
<p>Mourners included dozens of children and teens in hockey jerseys and Maple Leafs forward Jason Blake, the Frustaglios' former neighbour. The boy's passion for hockey was first sparked while watching the Canadian Olympic hockey team win a gold medal in 2002</p>
<p>"The job of burying your own kid is the most horrific thing for any human being to endure," Frustaglio said.</p>
<p>"With every fibre of our being we keep hoping we'll awake from this terrible nightmare and have him back in our arms again, shooting pucks in that driveway, protecting his brother Will, getting nagged by his mother Am to get to bed early and reminding me to get in shape."</p>
<p>Evan was a charming kid with a witty sense of humour who loved his parents and was a fierce protector of his younger brother, Frustaglio said.</p>
<p>"Not only did Evan act as Will's elder sibling, but he was also his best friend and what I described as his other father. Evan was always warning Will pay attention when riding his bike. Will, stay off the road, stay on the sidewalk. Keep away from the hot oven."</p>
<p>The day Evan died was also the day vaccination clinics in regions across Ontario opened to hours-long lineups for priority groups. Evan would not have been in one of the priority groups, which include people under 65 with chronic health conditions, pregnant women and children between six months and five years old.</p>

</p>
<p>The federal Opposition has suggested lives have been lost over delays in providing H1N1 flu vaccine to Canadians.</p>
<p>That seems early at best and egregiously politically opportunistic given Canada's stewarding of its flu vaccination program as compared to those in like nations. Unless the federal Liberals can provide names of those who have succumbed to the illness and were denied the vaccine because of reasons better handled elsewhere, they should hold their fire on this front. An anxious time in public health circles is a poor time to be making things even more so – without certain grounds to do so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, political watchdogs should be vigilant about the program.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better case in point that seems to be going without political critique is a belated decision by officials with the Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health. The local health unit only announced Monday it would fall in line with a days-old provincial health edict that only individuals in identified high risk groups should line-up and receive H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>Until Monday, the message from the local unit had been that no one will be turned away because on-hand vaccine supply was ample. Given the unstintingly, unequivocal briefings from upper-level public health officials that vaccine supply would drop significantly this week, the local unit's stance seemed inconsistent and incongruous.</p>
<p>It expressed an interest in communicating that only the most vulnerable candidates get access to the shots. But, until Monday, it did nothing more to make sure that the first available batch of the vaccine was reserved for those who seemingly needed it most – even as parallel health units in other areas were doing just that.</p>
<p>What will be the result of this supply management? It's still too early to say and the outcome will likely never be quantifiable.</p>
<p>We hope it will prove to be a lesson learned for internal stakeholders and a blip in what seems otherwise to be a nimble, responsive and effective national and provincial flu vaccine program.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>A new H1N1 assessment centre opens to the general public Tuesday in the Royal City.</p>
<p>In the face of growing instances of influenza, doctors and other health professionals at the Guelph Family Health Team are partnering with the Guelph General Hospital in the emergency initiative, team executive director Ross Kirkconnell said Monday.</p>
<p>"We're hoping this will help meet the community's needs."</p>
<p>It's not a vaccination centre but one in which people with flu-like symptoms can see health professionals to determine the extent of their illnesses.</p>
<p>The intention is to serve people who aren't in high risk groups, since high-risk individuals are already the focus of attention by the local public health board. These people with elevated risks include pregnant women, people under the age of 65 with chronic health ailments and children younger than five years of age.</p>
<p>Everyone else is welcome at the new assessment centre, located at 65 Delhi St., a former community centre behind the Family and Children's Services facility just down the street from the Guelph General Hospital on Guelph's northeast side. Hours this week are Tuesday through Friday from 2 to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>They'll be extended to 8 p.m. Monday through Friday starting next week.</p>
<p>Guelph General Hospital communications specialist Perry Hagerman said the new centre will help relieve pressure at the acute care facility's emergency department, which has seen an upswing in traffic since the flu season began recently. That includes Monday's 185 visitors to the emergency ward, up from a more typical daily average of 123, he noted.</p>
<p>Other cities have such assessment centres, including Hamilton, he added.</p>
<p>The assessment centre will also relieve pressure off family physicians, Kirkconnell said.</p>
<p>"Family doctors are typically seeing, in the past week, 10 additional patients a day," he said. That's on top of their scheduled patient loads.</p>
<p>Kirkconnell said people coming to the new assessment centre can generally expect one of three outcomes. They may be assessed by clinicians, whether doctors, nurses or nurse practitioners, with mild cases and sent home to rest. They may alternatively be given prescriptions for drugs to help them recover; or in potentially more serious cases sent to hospital for further testing, such as chest X-rays and lab tests.</p>
<p>It's not yet known how long the assessment centre will remain in existence during the current flu crisis.</p>
<p>"We're going to be assessing this as we go," Kirkconnell said. An assessment clinic is not something the medical team has ever set up before in the face of a pandemic. It's made its best guess on staffing levels that will be needed, said Kirkconnell, whose health team, formed two years ago, comprises almost four dozen doctors, as well as nurse practitioners and other health professionals in several city locations.</p>
<p>In other news, the University of Guelph began providing vaccination clinics on campus Monday. Located at the Powell Building's second floor, they're open to students, staff and faculty, though this week the clinics are restricted to high-risk people only because of vaccine scarcity. They run Mondays, Tuesdays and every other Friday through Dec. 1 from 9 a.m. 4 p.m. for both H1N1 and seasonal flu on a first-come, first-serve basis.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The province is looking to set up vaccination clinics in schools and workplaces after a chaotic start to its mass immunization campaign and as cases of H1N1 rapidly increase.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the campaign got off to a bumpy start last week, health officials say the province is stepping up its efforts by calling in retired nurses, opening more than 30 flu assessment centres where sick people can get medical help and doubling the number of mass vaccination clinics so that a total of 2.2 million Ontarians will be immunized by week's end.</p>
<p>"It's all hands on deck right now," Ontario Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King told a news conference Monday.</p>
<p>The province will only say "tens of thousands" have been immunized to date. An estimated 2.4 million Ontarians are considered at high risk of complications and are in the priority groups for flu shots, as are health care workers.</p>
<p>When the province moves from immunizing priority groups to healthy Ontarians, it is possible vaccines will be offered in places of employment and in schools, she said.</p>
<p>"We will consider expanding the settings dependent on who we are actually offering vaccine to. So once we get into the healthy working age population, we will start looking at workplace clinics. When we are into school-age children, we will be looking at optimum ways of reaching school-age children," she said.</p>
<p>The province has been under pressure to offer the flu shot in more places after mass vaccination clinics last week were overwhelmed with long lines and angry people, some of whom waited hours or were turned away.</p>
<p>"We are focused on making things better," Health Minister Deb Matthews said, noting the number of mass vaccination clinics have been increased to 100 from 50.</p>
<p>"Public health units across the province learned from last week. We made it very clear they needed to do better," she added.</p>
<p>Hospitals are being pressed to immunize more people. To date, they have been focusing on staff and in-patients.</p>
<p>Matthews said she has signed a special order allowing doctors to bill OHIP for telephone consultations with patients in an effort to take pressure off the health system and contain spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Normally doctors can bill the public health system only if they see patients in person.</p>
<p>Noting that Monday's inoculation efforts appeared to go smoothly, Matthews explained that more doctors now have vaccine available to offer patients.</p>
<p>King said rates of influenza-like illness are higher than what is normally seen at peak time during a flu season. As well, they are higher than what was seen at the peak of the first wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>There are 82 Ontarians in hospital with the virus right now, compared to 14 in August.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Amid an unexpected and broad shortage of pandemic H1N1 flu vaccine, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health is narrowing the focus of its inoculations this week to those at greatest risk.</p>
<p>"This is not something we want to do; this is what we must do in order to provide the vaccine to everyone who needs this vaccine," board Medical Officer of Health Dr. Nicola Mercer said Monday.</p>
<p>That means vaccination will "focus exclusively" on priority groups.</p>
<p>Clinic shots this week are to go to pregnant women, children six months to five years of age, health care workers and people under 65 years of age who have underlying chronic health conditions. Others "will be asked to return when there is enough vaccine to offer to non-priority groups," the health board stated in a release.</p>
<p>Last week, the board gave priority to these at-risk groups, but didn't turn anyone away if they wanted the inoculations. That left some priority people grumbling with dissatisfaction as they waited for hours in long lineups Saturday in Guelph.</p>
<p>Mercer said in a telephone interview the clinics last week were posted as serving at-risk people but there weren't sufficient clinic staffers to question everyone. That's changing: people coming for shots this week will be scrutinized.</p>
<p>"We are screening people at all of our sites starting today," she said Monday.</p>
<p>"Not everybody is happy," she conceded. It means at times that families are split, some members getting shots, others not qualifying.</p>
<p>Some senior citizens in particular are chafing at being turned away. Mercer said that's because of a misunderstanding on their part: seniors believe they're a high-risk group, whereas H1N1 targets children more. Though it seems counterintuitive, older Canadians aren't as threatened by the virus.</p>
<p>"It's very unfortunate. We are turning away a lot of our seniors," she said.</p>
<p>The health board, she said, is working as diligently as it can to meet a difficult challenge: protecting the public from a potentially dangerous organism circulating.</p>
<p>"The health unit is doing an admirable job. We are working hard and efficiently in a very challenging environment. Today is very challenging as we are turning people away."</p>
<p>Despite the shortage, public health has expanded clinic hours Monday in Fergus and Orangeville in an effort to ensure those priority targets get the shots they need as health authorities try to nip the flu season, which could extend into next spring, in the bud.</p>
<p>Clinics continue today from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at College Avenue Public School, 195 College Ave. W., in Guelph. The hours are 1 to 8 p.m. Tuesday at 855 St. David St. N. in Fergus and 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. Wednesday at 276A Broadway Ave. in Orangeville. A full schedule is on the health board's website: www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org].</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada reported Ontario flu clinics would only get 625,000 doses this week, down from two million a week in the previous three weeks. That's because of a shortfall in delivery by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>Production slowed at GlaxoSmithKline Inc. when it began making an unadjuvanted version of the vaccine, which doesn't contain an immunity booster in the more common vaccine version, Canadian Press reported Monday.</p>
<p>There's been public debate recently about whether the adjuvanted version could adversely affect some pregnant women.</p>

<p>PREGNANT WOMEN NEED ONE VACCINE DOSE</p>
<p>A U.S. study shows that healthy pregnant women get a good immune response to just a single dose of H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant.</p>
<p>But another U.S. study shows that children under 10 years will need two doses of H1N1 vaccine without adjuvant to be protected against the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>The studies, sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, were both done with unadjuvanted vaccine, which is the type being used in the United States.</p>
<p>Canada is using vaccine with an adjuvant, a boosting compound, for most people but is offering some adjuvant-free vaccine for pregnant women.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the institute, says the pregnant women in the study tolerated the vaccine well, and there were no safety concerns seen.</p>
<p>Canada currently suggests young children should get two doses of H1N1 vaccine, but is revisiting the recommendation because early data from another study shows one dose of adjuvanted vaccine may suffice.</p>
<p>IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT IF YOU'RE A BAD DRIVER?</p>
<p>Maybe you can blame it on your genes.</p>
<p>In a small University of California study, researchers found people with a gene variation performed 20 per cent worse on simulated driving tests and did as poorly a few days later. The researchers say almost one in three people have this gene variation.</p>
<p>Study author and neurologist Dr. Steven Cramer says people with the gene variation make more driving errors from the get-go, and they forget more of what they learned after time away.</p>
<p>The gene variation lowers available levels of a protein that boosts memory by helping brain cells talk to one another and work properly.</p>
<p>TAI CHI CAN HELP WITH KNEE PAIN</p>
<p>New research suggests regular Tai Chi exercise can reduce pain and help your knee function better.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers recruited 40 patients, with an average age of 65, who had been diagnosed with knee osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>Half took part in hour-long Tai Chi sessions twice weekly for three months.</p>
<p>The other participants took two hour-long classes per week for three months and learned about diet, nutrition and treatments for osteoarthritis.</p>
<p>They also stretched for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Those who practised Tai Chi had significantly less knee pain and also reported less depression and more physical function.</p>
<p>VISION PROBLEMS AFFECT LIFE EXPECTANCY</p>
<p>Australian researchers say untreatable vision problems are associated with a shorter lifespan.</p>
<p>The study included more than 3,600 people age 49 and older. In the 13 years after the study began, nearly 1,300 participants died.</p>
<p>The researchers noted that people with non-correctable impaired vision had a higher risk for dying in that time period.</p>
<p>The study showed that the association was strongest for those younger than 75.</p>
<p>Their study confirms previous findings linking vision impairment with an increased risk of death from such factors as accidental injury.</p>
<p>LOCATION OF FAT A FACTOR IN BLOOD CLOTS</p>
<p>A Danish study says the location of excess body fat appears to affect the risk of dangerous blood clots in veins -- although that location differs in men and women.</p>
<p>The 10-year study of more than 57,000 people found that bigger hips are associated with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in women but not men.</p>
<p>But a wider waistline was associated with an increased VTE risk in men. Obesity in general is an established risk factor for VTE, which occurs when a blood clot blocks a vein.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Critics blasted the Harper government for its handling of the H1N1 outbreak as long lineups continue for flu shots and some provinces warn of dwindling supplies of the vaccine.</p>
<p>A number of provinces, including Nova Scotia, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta, face vaccine shortages after a production problem at the manufacturer's plant last week slowed delivery of the drug.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff called the government incompetent during an emergency swine flu debate in the House of Commons last night.</p>
<p>He said the government had released confusing information about the H1N1 vaccine which is "a source of enormous anxiety among Canadian families."</p>
<p>"Instead of taking responsibility, the government blames everybody else: they blame the drug company because they don't have a supply next week; they blame the provinces and territories; we don't deliver health care, they say."</p>
<p>Ignatieff said "epidemics don't care about jurisdictions."</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq responded that thousands of Canadians are getting their inoculations and said there will be vaccines for everyone who wants one.</p>
<p>She rejected Ignatieff's claim that they are blaming other parties, saying they are using an influenza plan that was "built on years of collaboration with provinces and territories and the medical community."</p>
<p>The government came under fire after people wanting to get vaccinated faced long lineups, confusion and in some cases were turned away from clinics.</p>
<p>Lower-than-expected production of the vaccine this week by Quebec-based manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline has meant some clinics have run out of supply.</p>
<p>Opposition MPs peppered the Conservatives with questions in the Commons earlier yesterday, asking why the vaccine rollout has been such a "failure" given that the government assured the public months ago it would be prepared.</p>
<p>Liberal MP Bob Rae said the government has two main responsibilities: "The first is to ensure a steady and reliable supply of vaccines for H1N1. The second is to provide leadership and information on a coherent pandemic response."</p>
<p>"I would like to ask the government a very simple question: How could it have failed so miserably to execute these two critical responsibilities?" Rae asked.</p>
<p>Aglukkaq at first left it to Transport Minister John Baird to answer questions, before finally weighing in. She said every Canadian who wants the vaccine will get it by Christmas, adding that Canada has more doses of vaccine per capita than any other country.</p>
<p>"Six million doses were produced ahead of schedule. As soon as they were available and authorized, they were transferred to the provinces and territories for their rollout."</p>

</p>
<p>I frequently read The Spectator to keep abreast of ongoing public affairs. I trust it takes prudent care to ensure its facts are in order and its sources are honest.</p>
<p>It is with this in mind I must take issue with Susan Clairmont's column, Naturopaths shun vaccine, say fever is good (Oct. 31.) While I do support having an open forum for opinions, I believe articles should not be open to subjective validation; this information should be reserved for facts, and not pseudo-science and pseudo-medicine.</p>
<p>This article gives a voice to naturopath Laura Margaritis, who is erroneously urging people to disregard the H1N1 vaccine in favour of "natural" methods.</p>
<p>In case you were not aware, Naturopathy and its methods (herbology, homeopathy, etc.) have consistently failed standard double-blind experiments, and foists its claims solely on the idea that there is a "grand conspiracy" from public media forums such as yourselves to keep "the truth" about herbs and all-natural methods from entering the pharmaceutical mainstream.</p>
<p>You should find this absurd. Ginseng and St. John's wort may be all-natural, but so are nightshade, strychnine and hemlock. All-natural doesn't necessarily mean good for you.</p>
<p>Margaritis tries to drive her point home by claiming that Tylenol, not H1N1, was responsible for the death of a 13-year old. This is a standard argumentative fallacy. Just because A is false, it does not mean that B is true. This claim is made even more embarrassing by the admission that her source on this is "the media."</p>
<p>That's quite vague. How can we put our trust in someone who doesn't even deign to check or quote her sources?</p>
<p>She goes on to recommend Oscillococcinum, a homeopathic remedy which is likely untested and almost assuredly unproven to work.</p>
<p>Any amount of research on the rudiments of homeopathy is sure to make any person with reasonable intelligence cringe with embarrassment for its followers and practitioners.</p>
<p>She promotes the idea that the body needs to "... go through (the illness) and teach the body how to deal with it." Try telling that to a cancer patient.</p>
<p>Right now, we can all agree that we are facing a problem with the H1N1 epidemic, and we are all affected by fear.</p>
<p>It is in times like these that we are the most vulnerable to being taken advantage of, and I feel that it is the responsibility of responsible media such as The Spectator to give credence to proven scientific methods and not to milk people's vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Misinforming the public about medicine in a time such as this is, at the very least, irresponsible reporting, and at the very worst, gross negligence.</p>
<p>The Spectator should understand that the majority of the public rely on newspapers and other media for relevant information. Clairmont points out early on in her column that the majority of legitimate medical practitioners feel that Margaritis' methods are "... bunk. Useless at best. Dangerous at worst."</p>
<p>Then why publish the article in the first place?</p>
<p>Here are some useful links for people who wish to become informed about the pseudo-scientific quackery of homeopathy and naturopathy:</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>While we are in the grip of the H1N1 virus, let's think about the many housekeepers who were given the pink slip recently from our local hospitals, schools and many other public places.</p>
<p>Let's think about the nurses and personal support workers who have to hold down two jobs, if they can be found, to make ends meet, spreading germs and God knows what from client to client.</p>
<p>Our immigration doors are spread wide open. We need not only to teach some newcomers English, but also to teach them our way of germ evasion and cleanliness.</p>
<p>H1N1 is a warning to keep germs in our own homes.</p>
<p>If anyone is to be blamed for the turmoil that H1N1 is causing, it is our politicians turning a blind eye to keeping their citizens safe and making our workers No. 1.</p>

<p>Re: 'Shortage of vaccine forces crackdown' (Oct. 31)</p>
<p>Who belonged to the naive and simple bunch who thought that everyone would behave honourably and only show up for the first round of H1N1 shots if they were members of a priority group?</p>
<p>Who are the people who seem to think it's not so bad for disabled people with underlying health concerns, infants and toddlers, as well as pregnant women to wait for hours on a rainy day only to be turned away?</p>
<p>Who thought it wouldn't be a big deal for people on a limited income to take an unpaid day off of work to do their duty by their little ones, only to be told to come back and try on another day?</p>
<p>Apparently, they're planning a crackdown after estimating that one third of those who have already received the shot do not belong to a priority group. How, pray, are they going to accomplish that? Will they have access to everyone's medical history at the flu shot clinics?</p>
<p>Why wasn't a system set up whereby those in high priority groups could receive the shot from their family doctors, along with a few clinics for those without a family doctor? Those clinics, in turn, could have been staffed with enough people to verify that those seeking immunization did in fact have chronic illnesses.</p>
<p>Seriously -- I'd like to know the names of the people who honestly thought this would be the best way to get H1N1 immunizations first to those who need them the most.</p>
<p>That way, I could look up their names next time the sunshine list of public servant salaries is published.</p>

</p>
<p>Ontario is buying an additional 216 ventilators for hospitals coping with a wave of H1N1 influenza patients.</p>
<p>The ventilators are to be delivered by tomorrow and will be distributed to the province's local health integration networks over the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The new equipment will be available "just in case" the number of people critically ill with the H1N1 flu surges, said David Jensen, spokesperson for the Ministry of Health.</p>
<p>"I would not say there is a shortage of ventilators right now."</p>
<p>Ontario will spend $7 million on the new ventilators, which will add to an existing province-wide inventory of 8,000 units. The machines will likely be placed in depots located in teaching hospitals throughout the province. They will be distributed to individual hospitals based on need.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, 82 people in Ontario were hospitalized with H1N1. At Hamilton Health Sciences, two children and three adults are now in intensive care with the virus. An additional three patients with H1N1 are in the ICU at St. Joseph's Healthcare.</p>
<p>HHS is coping "very well" with the demand on its intensive care unit and has enough equipment and staff to expand the department by 15 per cent if necessary, said Charlotte Daniels, vice-president of patient services.</p>
<p>The intensive care unit at HHS has 266 ventilators for 72 adult beds and 8 child beds. Most of those ventilators are compatible with children and adults.</p>
<p>"I feel confident that we're prepared," Daniels said.</p>
<p>St. Joseph's Healthcare has 15 ICU beds with ventilators and can expand to 22 beds if necessary.</p>
<p>About 20 per cent of patients who are hospitalized with H1N1 end up needing treatment from intensive care units. Many of those patients will require mechanical ventilators to assist breathing.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, the Ontario Council of Hospital Unions -- a division of CUPE representing 25,000 nurses and support staff -- raised concerns over whether hospitals have the ventilators and ICU beds necessary to handle a flood of H1N1 patients.</p>
<p>Though the province's decision to purchase more equipment is "positive," it may not be enough, said Michael Hurley, president of the council.</p>
<p>"Given the delay in the vaccine rollout, we're concerned there will be a surge of patients in ERs," he said. "I would be concerned that 216 ventilators for the entire province is not a significant number."</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 vaccines going out to Hamilton's doctors today are expected to ease clinic lineups and ensure only high-risk groups receive the current available doses.</p>
<p>The city's four clinics yesterday immunized several thousand but were much less chaotic than last week's one or two daily clinics.</p>
<p>The day started with lineups of about 300 to 400 at all clinics -- some people came four hours early -- but the lines were gone by late afternoon.</p>
<p>Health-care workers tried to confirm only those at high risk attended, but they still relied on people's honesty. The crowds consisted mostly of pregnant women, young children under 5, health-care workers, and people under 65 with noticeable medical conditions -- all of them high risk. Only a few people were turned away.</p>
<p>Dr. Chris Mackie, Hamilton's associate medical officer of health, said it's virtually impossible to verify the high-risk people "because we have to go quickly."</p>
<p>He said, "We have good evidence the public is being honest," but family doctors are best at knowing for sure.</p>
<p>Lineups are expected to dwindle further today when 50 to 60 doctors across the city receive their vaccine orders -- 100 doses maximum per single practice. Another several dozen will get their orders in the next two days, Mackie said.</p>
<p>An estimated 106,000 Hamilton residents are at high risk. As of Friday, 15,000 were immunized. On the weekend, 1,100 health-care workers got their shots.</p>
<p>Mackie said the absence of lineups late yesterday might not mean clinics for the general public open soon because there are still vaccine shortages.</p>
<p>Fear of running out had Wendy and George Karlos lining up at St. Helen's clinic at 9 a.m. yesterday, four hours before it opened, to ensure daughters Julia, 11, with a heart condition, and Melissa, 9, who has asthma, were immunized.</p>
<p>"I can get sick, that's OK. But not them," said Wendy.</p>
<p>Nick Wiesner's doctor has the vaccine but he opted to attend the clinic with his son and grandson. Wiesner, 58, has chronic bronchitis but is more worried about his grandson Nicholas.</p>
<p>"I read that children under 5 are susceptible and if they don't get (the vaccine), they can die."</p>
<p>At Jackson Square, Greg Macdonald was last in line, but waiting patiently. He tried to get his shot last week in Dundas, but could not wait the full four hours because he had to pick up his two-year-old at day care.</p>
<p>Macdonald needs to be immunized because his three-month-old daughter is at McMaster Children's Hospital. He won't risk catching H1N1 and passing it on to her.</p>
<p>He said the recent sudden death of a 13-year-old Etobicoke boy with H1N1 scared people into getting immunized.</p>
<p>"If nothing else, his death probably saved a lot of lives."</p>
<p>At St. Helen's, the stress of getting turned away was too much for Laura Young. She took the day off work to bring a frail friend with a serious lung disease for a shot, but her friend was refused because she is 65.</p>
<p>"I'm pissed," said Young. "What does it take (to give her a shot)? One minute. If I find out one person didn't meet the criteria, I'll call my MP."</p>
<p>Another woman with diabetes and heart problems tried to get to the front of the line but left in tears when refused by a health-care worker. It was a misunderstanding, according to health officials, because people unable to stand were being ushered into the school to wait in chairs.</p>
<p>HAMILTON AND AREA H1N1 FLU VACCINATION CLINICS THIS WEEK</p>
<p>All clinics for now are only for people under age 65 with chronic medical conditions, pregnant women (20 weeks or more gestation), children six months to under five years, caregivers of high-risk people and essential health-care workers.</p>

</p>
<p>Liberal party president Alfred Apps suggested yesterday that the H1N1 crisis is Prime Minister Stephen Harper's "Hurricane Katrina," a metaphor that outraged many Conservatives -and also had some Liberals suggesting Apps may have hurt his side with an overheated analogy.</p>
<p>In an email circulated to dozens of Liberals - including the party's public health critic Carolyn Bennett, other MPs, and members of Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff's inner circle of advisers - Apps also lambasted Harper for gambling with the health of Canadians and for failing to act quickly enough to make sure any Canadian who wanted a vaccine for H1N1 had access to one.</p>
<p>"That single, irresponsible abdication of leadership triggered mass confusion," Apps wrote. "Now that Canadians are unnecessarily dying, we are all entitled to ask why this government thought it necessary or appropriate to spend tens of millions of taxpayer dollars on slick partisan advertising promoting its pork-barrel infrastructure plan ... while at the same time completely ignoring the need to educate the general public about the importance of infection protection and immunization, securing adequate supplies of vaccine and working with the provinces more closely to ensure an efficient and effective delivery system.</p>
<p>"Is the H1N1 pandemic the Hurricane Katrina of our own laissez-faire, fend-for-yourself government?" Apps asked. "Reflect on the analogous situation we face. It's as though (Harper's) strategy, if not to turn a blind eye to the threat altogether, was simply to do the bare minimum and hope the problem would go away. There was no 'swine flu action plan' worthy of the name."</p>
<p>In an interview last night, Apps said he was not suggesting Hurricane Katrina and the Canadian H1N1 crisis are equivalent in terms of the devastation each caused, but he said the two governments of the day approached each crisis from similar ideological standpoints.</p>
<p>"The point is it's the same values that underlie the way they've handled it," Apps said.</p>
<p>Then-U.S. president George. W. Bush and his government were widely criticized for appearing to be insensitive to the plight of hundreds of thousands in New Orleans and the U.S. deep south in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and for failing to quickly provide appropriate federal aid to the region.</p>
<p>But the analogy outraged some Conservatives.</p>
<p>"It is very sad and unfortunate that the Ignatieff Liberals are desperately attempting to politicize the H1N1 preparedness efforts of the federal and provincial governments," said Dimitri Soudas, the prime minister's chief spokesman.</p>
<p>Even some Liberals, upon receiving Apps letter, questioned whether the analogy went too far and would damage Liberal credibility on the file.</p>
<p>"One huge problem is that the public is unlikely to see this as a political issue," said a veteran Liberal, who advised previous Liberal leaders on their communications strategies. "Among many other things, health is a provincial responsibility."</p>

<p>I waited in line two hours for my flu shot. I picked up a really nasty cold, too.</p>
<p>So, has anyone else noticed the first words from the lips of Tory MLAs these days has become "In hindsight..."?</p>
<p>Get a grip, Venters. Alberta is not a "Third World country," something you'd know if you had ever lived in or even visited one. The lines in real Third World countries are for food and water, not for a flu vaccine that everyone gets for free if only they are patient for a while.</p>
<p>I've nattered endlessly about the Alberta PCs, but I cannot think they leaped into the H1N1 situation intending to cause the chaos we are now enduring. Give them a break.</p>
<p>It isn't the government's fault the flu-shot clinics had to close. It's hard for the government to plan for the irrational, illogical panic of the masses.</p>
<p>The peerlessly swift rubber-stamp process used by Health Canada to approve the nation's H1N1 vaccine supply should be eligible for entry into Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>At least the vaccination fiasco makes it abundantly clear what a mistake it would be to believe Ron Liepert could make anything run more efficiently.</p>

<p>If you're really ticked off at the way the H1N1 fiasco is being handled, every working Albertan should call in sick for a few days. One hundred per cent absenteeism may actually get the politicians' attention.</p>
<p>Discussing H1N1 is now more dangerous than discussing politics. Get vaccinated or don't, but don't lobby others to take your position.</p>

<p>Why are some left-turn lights turned off on evenings and weekends? They're still needed on Friday and Saturday nights. If traffic is light, an advance green does not impede its flow.</p>
<p>After sitting through two complete light cycles at 50th Street and the Whitemud with no left-turn green lights in evidence, I moved on. Someone may want to go down and rescue the people who are still down there waiting to turn.</p>
<p>No matter how opulent and pretentious the name car manufacturers like to attach to a station wagon, it's still just a station wagon.</p>
<p>I was angry to read that security costs for the recent private Canadian visits of George Bush and Bill Clinton were picked up by the RCMP--or more accurately, the taxpayers. That should have been covered by the sponsors of their respective speaking engagements.</p>
<p>According to The Journal, Canadian screenwriter Paul Haggis has quit Scientology. That's his choice, but why take so long to quit a religion years after it forced his wife to cut her parents out of her life?</p>
<p>Canada is a multicultural nation. Several houses put up decorative lights for Diwali, the Festival of Lights, which was celebrated in October. In November, we will have our lights on to celebrate the birthdate of Guru Nanak, the founder of the Sikh religion. We will also have them on for Christmas.</p>
<p>So daylight time has ended. I still turn my lights on in the morning before heading out to work and now I also get to turn them on an hour earlier in the afternoon. How is that saving our planet?</p>
<p>According to The Journal, the city has kicked in$547,000 for the Garneau Theatre's renovations. What I want to see is that money kicked into a school lunch program instead.</p>
<p>I made a decision in January not to buy any new clothes for one year. It hasn't been a big problem, considering how disgusting the fashions of today can be.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>New health centre to open without capacity to do its job; Facility part of defunct Capital Health plan, but revamped system has no resources to fund needed programs</b>
</div><div>Paula Simons   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>924 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Four years ago, in late October of 2005, Iris Evans, who was then the minister of health, and Sheila Weatherill, who was then the CEO of Capital Health, announced plans for a grand primary health facility to serve east central Edmonton.</p>
<p>The East Edmonton Primary Health Care Centre, built beside the old Cromdale School at 112th Avenue and 82nd Street, was billed as a revolutionary advance in community wellness.</p>
<p>The centre, which was scheduled to open this past March, was to be staffed with nurses and dentists, social workers and addictions counsellors, offering everything from speech pathology for children to mental health services to prenatal classes.</p>
<p>On top of that, health officials promised there would be the equivalent of six full-time family physicians on-site, to provide primary care in a neighbourhood with a chronic lack of family doctors. There was also to be an urgent care centre, open weekends and every night until midnight, with staff on-site to do things such as X-ray broken limbs, put on casts, stitch up wounds and prescribe antibiotics to crying babies with ear infections. The idea was to save people long painful waits in the emergency room -and take pressure off overtaxed emergency departments.</p>
<p>The shiny new centre was built to serve about 60,000 people in central Edmonton, from Rossdale in the south up to 127th Avenue in the north, between 109th Street in the west and 50th Street to the east. It's a wildly diverse area, which includes swish downtown lofts and fabulous Ada Boulevard mansions, homeless shelters and rooming houses, apartment blocks and middle-class bungalows. Thirty per cent of the area's residents are new immigrants; 15 per cent are aboriginal. The centre was to be for them all.</p>
<p>Initially, not everybody in the neighbourhood was thrilled with the prospect. There were fears about losing the historic Cromdale school, and about losing community green space. But after months and months of community meetings and public consultations, Capital Health and architect Vivian Manasc came up with a design that seemed to make most people happy, one that preserved and renovated the original Cromdale building as clinic and office space, and integrated it with the eco-friendly new urgent care centre next door. Originally budgeted at $23 million, the final cost was $44 million.</p>
<p>The East Edmonton Primary Health Care Centre is now projected to open sometime next month -if enough staff can be freed up from the H1N1 vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>There's just one problem.</p>
<p>The money to staff and operate the facility's much-vaunted urgent care centre has evaporated, lost in the transition between Capital Health and the merged Alberta Health Services superboard.</p>
<p>So, too, has the budget for those six family medicine positions.</p>
<p>Marianne Stewart, the Edmonton vice-president of Alberta Health Services, says all the existing community health programs currently offered at the old Eastwood Health Centre on 118th Avenue will be moving to the new facility, as will social workers from Alberta Children's Services. But, she says, there is no money for any new programming or staff. The urgent care centre is all built. But it will remain closed, indefinitely. In fact, she acknowledges, about half of the new building will be left vacant.</p>
<p>When will those family physicians move in?When will the urgent care clinic open?Not this year, says Stewart. And not in 2010 or 2011 either. Stewart says urgent care is still part of the long-term plan, but she can't say when operational dollars will be available.</p>
<p>In other words, we've just spent $44 million on the fanciest public health clinic in town.</p>
<p>"Things have changed," says Tadra Boulton, the Edmonton spokesperson for AHS. "We are now Alberta Health Services, and we face a different budget reality."</p>
<p>Stewart puts things even more starkly.</p>
<p>"This project was dreamed up and envisioned by Capital Health. And Capital Health no longer exists."</p>
<p>Of course, this isn't just a question of a new health board, and a new management team, with different politics and priorities than the old one. It's also a question of economics in tough times. But attempting to balance budgets by cutting funding for front-line primary health care is penny-wise and pound-foolish.</p>
<p>It makes no economic sense to spend$44 million on a revolutionary new clinic and then not use it for the purpose for which it was designed. Indeed, it will save our health care system money in the long run, if we keep patients out of hospitals beds by providing them with timely access to family physicians and urgent medical treatment.</p>
<p>What makes no sense at all is the province's binge/purge budgetary bulimia. We spend like mad on health infrastructure during a boom, and then, when resource revenues slump, we refuse to pay for the staff to open the doors. The East Edmonton Primary Health Care Centre is just of latest example of a stalled health care project, of course. But for inner-city residents who were promised a health care revolution, it's a bitter pill to swallow.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sanitize your gym workout; Wiping down shared equipment should be a habit</b>
</div><div>Jill Barker   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>825 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Exercise is a known immunity booster, which is why Health Canada recommends regular workouts as part of its strategy to protect against the H1N1 virus. But is the gym the best place to avoid the flu, or is the shared equipment and sweaty population prime breeding ground for a virus that experts say has reached pandemic status?</p>
<p>"You're more likely to get the flu from the guy on the treadmill next to you than from the treadmill itself," said Dalius Briedis, an infectious disease specialist at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).</p>
<p>H1N1 is predominantly transferred from individual to individual through aerosol droplets in the air, which means being coughed on by someone beside you is the most likely way for the flu to be transmitted. So, the first step in staying healthy is asking exercisers to avoid the gym when they are sick.</p>
<p>That being said, Briedis noted that it is possible for the virus to stay viable for a short period of time on a hard surface like a piece of fitness equipment. Therefore it's prudent to take extra precautions when using equipment that is passed from one exerciser to the next, like cardio and weight training machines, exercise balls and dumbbells.</p>
<p>"If you come in contact with the virus and then touch your face, nose or eyes, it's possible to get the flu," said Briedis.</p>
<p>Wiping down equipment with a cleaning solution after use, draping a clean towel over an exercise mat or bench and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after a workout should be standard practice in gyms.</p>
<p>But gym rats aren't the only exercisers who need to take special precautions when it comes to avoiding the flu. According to Briedis, sport teams are also at increased risk of exposure to the H1N1 virus. The proximity of athletes to each other and to their personal belongings makes the virus easy to pass along from one teammate to the next. And once the flu hits one team member, there's no telling how quickly it will spread and the kind of impact it can have on a team's ability to field enough players to compete.</p>
<p>A look back in history suggests that the flu can have devastating effects on a team.</p>
<p>"In the winter of 1918/19, the Stanley Cup playoffs were cancelled due to an outbreak of the Spanish flu," said Briedis. "Four members of the Canadiens team got sick and one died."</p>
<p>Fortunately, the H1N1 virus has been linked to a small number of fatalities worldwide and, for the most part, results in a moderate fever, aches and pains and a runny nose, which in a healthy population means spending a few days in bed recuperating. But that doesn't mean it can be treated lightly by teams and leagues across the country.</p>
<p>Simple precautions can reduce the risk. Water bottles and towels shouldn't be shared between athletes (all towels should be removed from team benches) and a protocol should be in place to keep sick athletes away from their healthy teammates.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends quarantining an athlete until they are symptom-free (no coughing, sneezing or fever) for 24 hours. If an athlete gets sick on the road, they should be put in a private room and wear a mask during the bus ride home where they should sit as far away from their teammates as possible. The same goes for the sick athlete's roommate who should be kept under a watchful eye for three days.</p>
<p>As for the ritual of shaking hands after a game, Briedis isn't in favour of suspending this age old tradition. With physical contact a natural consequence of most team sports, there is little to be gained by forgoing shaking hands, especially if athletes wash their hands or use hand sanitizers immediately after the game.</p>
<p>The ritual Briedis is in favour of forgoing, however, is the Montreal two-cheek kiss, which he claims should be suspended until after the H1N1 virus runs its course.</p>
<p>If the flu does strike, the decision to exercise or compete is probably moot as fever and the associated aches and pains will relegate all but the hardiest to bed until the symptoms abate. The average time to recuperate is three to seven days, after which exercisers are encouraged to get back in the game or gym slowly.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends waiting for 24 hours after the fever has abated before resuming light exercise. A body recuperating from the flu is quick to fatigue, so respect the signals your body is sending and take it easy if you feel less than 100 per cent during your workout.</p>

down gym equipment, but avoid the workout if you are sick.

<p>Re: "Lower-risk groups clog lineup for H1N1 shots," Letters, Oct. 28.</p>
<p>Why do some people think seniors are disposable members of society?</p>
<p>Today's seniors have been instrumental in keeping this country afloat. Don't forget, they haven't always been seniors and have paid their share of taxes, health-care premiums and user fees for years.</p>
<p>As for seniors "having immunity" because they went through a flu epidemic before, what about those who never caught the flu the first time?</p>
<p>Seniors are very conscientious of fairness. Those who are in line for shots are there because they are at risk (emphysema, asthma, heart conditions, diabetes--just to name a few of the possible risk factors). Most of the healthier seniors are still waiting for their vaccination, just like other healthy Albertans.</p>

<p>I would like to thank the nurses and nursing students who have been manning the flu clinics, and dispensing the H1N1 and regular flu vaccine.</p>
<p>It is a lot of work to do this hour after hour, and to be courteous and professional with everyone who comes to these clinics. Although people worry about catching the flu when standing in line, these nurses are the most exposed to germs, as they come into close contact with many unimmunized people.</p>
<p>The nurses know this, but this is the reality of nursing work--to provide hands-on care to the public.</p>
<p>Thank you also to the greeters at the clinics, and to the public for wanting to get immunized.</p>

<p>My son and I are high risk. We have asthma and haven't been vaccinated yet. We use inhalers everyday.</p>
<p>Standing in line for three to seven hours would not be healthy for us. Chances are we'd end up sick with colds and/or have an asthma attack.</p>
<p>For those of us who are high risk, H1N1 is a serious concern. My twin sister in Vancouver, who also has asthma, contracted H1N1 a week ago. She now has pneumonia, as well as the flu. She will be off work for weeks and still has to care for her young daughters, while her husband works. That is why high-risk people need to be vaccinated first. We just don't get the flu; we get complications as well.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to screen for high-risk people. If you have an underlying health problem, such as MS, diabetes, asthma, heart problem, etc., you will be on medication. Bring your medications or prescription receipts to the flu-shot clinics as proof that you are in a high-risk group.</p>

<p>It is estimated that 50 to 100 million people died worldwide in the 1918 flu pandemic. If the current strain of H1N1 was as virulent as the Spanish flu, we would be in big trouble. In spite of having months to prepare for this flu season, our vaccination efforts can best be described as a complete failure. Even some of our local health-care providers have not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>I have concluded that the Alberta government cannot be trusted to handle medical emergencies. Their sole concerns appear to be low taxes and royalties for industry;privatization of our health-care system; and getting re-elected.</p>
<p>We therefore must have a separate group with the sole mandate of preventing illness and loss of life due to the flu. This current mess should not be allowed to happen again.</p>

<p>Re: "All flu shots on hold; Alberta will resume vaccinations next week for high-risk groups," The Journal, Nov. 1.</p>
<p>Health officials started off wanting to treat everyone the same; naively believing that those at lower risk would step aside and allow high-risk individuals to receive their vaccinations first.</p>
<p>Most people are very concerned about H1N1, and some are panicking. More people than ever want a flu vaccination, and a weakened health-care services delivery system simply cannot respond as needed.</p>
<p>I think there will be cause to attempt other mass immunizations in the near future. If nothing else, this experience shows that we should be prepared to cope with the extraordinary demands that emergencies such as this place on our health-care infrastructure.</p>
<p>Likely, there will be other, more severe pandemics in the future. We ought to be preparing for this eventuality by increasing hospital staff and beds. We need to shore up public health departments so that they are better able to cope. It is very important that we re-examine the wisdom of 15 years of health-care infrastructure cuts, which have decimated our ability to handle even less serious emergencies like this H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"Just-in-time" supply management for health-care services simply does not work in this pandemic age.</p>

<p>I'm sure that each new fatality will be diligently brought to our attention so that Canadians can be made fearful and live in trepidation, to the point of rage when there is fear of a vaccine shortage. My sympathies go to the families of those who have died as a result of this flu.</p>
<p>I hope that Health Canada can learn from this situation and just as quickly come up with a vaccine for an even more widespread killer of Canadians--3,122 in 2006 alone.</p>

<p>The blame for the shameful debacle in Alberta over H1N1 vaccine distribution must be laid directly on the doorstep of Ron Liepert.</p>
<p>This is his responsibility; he has failed miserably and Premier Ed Stelmach should demand his resignation immediately. After this pathetic display, would Stelmach give Liepert the responsibility to manage a vaccination program on his farm?</p>
<p>The Conservative government had a year to plan for H1N1. Despite Liepert's assurances that all Albertans would eventually have access to the vaccine, he also states that he only planned to vaccinate 30 per cent of the people. In an increasingly contradictory set of press releases, he now says that all Albertans will have access to the vaccine in three months. Will Liepert be the last one in line, receiving his flu vaccine at the end of the flu season?</p>
<p>Alberta voters need to wake up and throw this Conservative government out of office. We need fair distribution of seats in the legislature that truly represents the rural/urban divide and a voting system that fairly reflects the votes of each Albertan.</p>

<p>For months, I have listened to members of the opposition take cheap shots at the government and, in particular, the premier.</p>
<p>But Liberal Leader David Swann's demand that Liepert step down was over the top. Maliciously feeding public hysteria is irresponsible.</p>
<p>Let's look at some facts about the H1N1 pandemic:</p>
<p>-The provincial government had no control over when pharmaceutical companies would start producing the vaccine or how much they would produce and release;</p>
<p>-All provinces are only being allocated so much vaccine.We may think we are more special than our neighbours, but we aren't;</p>
<p>-Alberta Health Services tried to give Albertans credit for being reasonable; clearly stated that high-risk people should be the first to be vaccinated and assumed we would respect that. Apparently, the majority of us did not. We have given our government no option but to prioritize those who will receive vaccine, because we couldn't do it ourselves.</p>
<p>If the government is guilty of anything, it is that it gave us too much credit. It probably should have enforced prioritization sooner.</p>
<p>When the vaccination clinics reopen, the process will take even longer because a more intense screening process will have to be enforced.</p>
<p>We have had it good for so long, and have had the funds to buy what we need. I think there was a misconception, that we could just buy enough vaccine for everyone in Alberta.</p>
<p>This is a wake-up call for all of us.</p>

<p>Is anyone truly surprised that the H1N1 immunization process has turned out to be the fiasco that it is given that, in the summer of 2008, Health Minister Ron Liepert refused to renew the contracts of three prominent public health doctors?</p>
<p>Dr. Karen Grimsrud, acting chief medical officer of health;Dr. Ameeta Singh, an infectious disease medical consultant;and Dr. Gloria Keays, deputy provincial health officer and West Nile virus expert were all let go by this government. Liepert said their "contracts were not renewed because of salary demands the government couldn't afford."</p>
<p>According to The Journal, all three were paid less than their counterparts in other provinces. In fact, the total salary of all three combined was less than the $570,000 salary being paid to an economist from Australia with no formal medical training. Yet it is Stephen Duckett who is setting public health policy during this crisis.</p>
<p>More recently, Dr. Jutta Preiksaitis, medical director of the provincial laboratory for public health and an internationally renowned expert in infectious disease control, also had her contract terminated. It seems to me that a medical doctor who has been researching infectious diseases for the last 26 years is exactly the person you want on the job during a viral pandemic.</p>
<p>The frightening thing in all of this is that this government hasn't the faintest idea that public health is the foundation of any health-care system and is the most cost-effective way of improving health and preventing illnesses.</p>
<p>It is time that Premier Ed Stelmach got rid of Liepert and put control of health care in the hands of someone with some degree of intelligence and medical expertise.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Time province gets swine flu story straight; Government's mixed messages of past week put most vulnerable at risk</b>

<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>934 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>It would seem the Alberta government chose the wrong time to get democratic.</p>
<p>By opening the swine flu vaccination to everyone last week, the government inadvertently undermined the program so that now, at least temporarily, it's open to no one.</p>
<p>The government likes to say it's a victim of its own success, that 400,000 Albertans were immunized the first six days. The fact is, the government is a victim of its own muddled communications and mixed messaging.</p>
<p>Getting 400,000 people inoculated is an impressive feat, but it would be much more impressive if all of those vaccinated were in the highrisk groups and did not include average, healthy Albertans frightened into jumping the queue, so to speak, while pregnant women and toddlers waited at the back of the line.</p>
<p>The government insists it did not issue any mixed messages. No?You decide.</p>
<p>Here is Health Minister Ron Liepert early last week: "I urge all Albertans to go out and get immunized."</p>
<p>And here is Premier Ed Stelmach: "We're not asking only those highrisk groups to get the vaccine first. It's open to all."</p>
<p>The government couldn't be more clear; it was telling all Albertans that, not only are the doors open to all, all should open the doors.</p>
<p>But here's Liepert again, later in the week: "The message isn't any different today than it was four days ago. We would encourage those who are not at high risk to be patient and wait, those who are at high risk, please go and get your vaccination. Nothing has changed."</p>
<p>Here he is last Friday, admitting health officials should have targeted more of the high-risk groups: "In hindsight, that's probably something we should have done is have specialized clinics."</p>
<p>Here he is on Monday talking to reporters: "There is no mixed message coming from us."</p>
<p>And here he is on Monday in the legislative assembly talking about what he said last week: "I announced at that time that our efforts would focus on high-risk groups first, but I also said that we would not turn anyone away, and Albertans heard that message."</p>
<p>Which message did they hear? That we should focus on high-risk groups? Or that vaccination clinics were open to everyone? That's not a mixed message?</p>
<p>The problem with treating everyone equally in a swine flu pandemic is that this strain of swine flu doesn't appear to be particularly democratic. It doesn't treat everyone the same. It doesn't target the usual flu victims-- the elderly--but instead goes after those who usually weather the flu --the young and healthy.</p>
<p>One of those was a 13-year-old Ontario boy, Evan Frustaglio, who died just a few days after contracting the disease and who, in the words of his father, has become the face of the H1N1 virus. It was Evan's heartbreaking and shocking death, and an announcement by health officials that they were running out of vaccine, that helped trigger a national stampede to the vaccination clinics --and triggered grumbling from coast to coast about long lineups and closed clinics.</p>
<p>In that way, Alberta is not alone. No government in Canada is going to escape criticism, no matter its political stripe.</p>
<p>In Alberta, we have the opposition Liberals attacking the governing Conservatives.</p>
<p>In Ontario, it's the other way around: "Only in Dalton McGuinty's Ontario would prisoners be moved to the front of the line while pregnant women and children wait in the rain for hours," said the leader of Ontario's Conservative opposition, Tim Hudak.</p>
<p>Some frustrated Torontonians waiting in line have shouted slogans such as, "This is not a third-world country."</p>
<p>The federal government is, predictably, under attack from opposition critics, but the country's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, may have inadvertently put the "panic" into pandemic by telling all Canadians that getting a flu shot is a civic duty: "Being immunized is important, not only for protection of ourselves, but for those around us--because, if I'm not sick, I can't make anybody else sick...I will be immunized, because the last thing I want in the world is to cause anybody else to be sick, let alone to be severely ill or to die."</p>
<p>That's sort of what the Alberta government was telling people last week, even while it also tried to focus on high-risk groups.</p>
<p>For all their talk of last week's "success," members of the Alberta government realize they have a public relations problem. You don't close vaccination clinics in the midst of a pandemic without upsetting the people those clinics are supposed to inoculate.</p>
<p>That's why Premier Stelmach cancelled an appearance on Monday morning to open the Calgary Ring Road and instead huddled in his office with Liepert and the province's Chief Medical Officer of Health Andre Corriveau.</p>
<p>It's some consolation that virtually every other province is in the same miserable boat.</p>
<p>No jurisdiction has figured out how to make the system run smoothly.</p>
<p>Alberta wasn't the only province giving its citizens a mixed message.</p>
<p>Today, the government will have a new message, one aimed at encouraging high-risk Albertans to get a vaccination, while bluntly telling the rest of us to wait.</p>
<p>Let's hope the message is that clear and unmuddled.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Albertans waiting longer for surgery</b>
</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>674 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Lost amid the clamour over long lineups for H1N1 vaccine last week was the Fraser Institute's report on Canadian health-care wait times. The good news is that across Canada, median patient waits for surgery or medical procedures decreased in 2009. The bad news for Albertans, however, is that patient waits in this province this year increased over last year. Alberta's median wait time was 19.6 weeks, up from 18.5 weeks in 2008, according to the right-wing West Coast think-tank.</p>
<p>Despite a decade of health-care spending increases, Canadians are still waiting about 113 days for necessary treatment--about the same wait they endured in 2000-01.</p>
<p>Both Alberta Health Minister Ron Liepert and Alberta Health Services CEO Stephen Duckett have vowed to improve patient access to health care and reduce wait times. Duckett's $144,000 annual bonus even depends on that. But Albertans are grappling to figure out how this will be accomplished as the province struggles with a$7-billion deficit this year and deficits forecast for the next three years. Even more concerning, Alberta Health Services is wrestling with its own $1-billion deficit.</p>
<p>Duckett was introduced with much fanfare last January as "an agent of change," a health-care innovator and the leader of health care in Australia. He said this summer that emergency wait times will be cut in half within three years. Ironically, one of the ways he planned to do that was with a free H1N1 flu virus vaccine.</p>
<p>In Australia, Duckett expanded private delivery of public health care to bring down wait times, but he has said he doesn't plan to move Alberta in that direction. So how does he plan to do it?</p>
<p>A draft of the AHS three-year strategic plan calls for a 25-per-cent reduction in wait times for knee surgery, from 47 weeks to 35 weeks within three years. The plan also calls for a reduction in wait times for hip replacements, cutting the 33-week wait to 26 weeks in three years. Last month, Duckett conceded his latest plan to move several hundred seniors from acute to long-term care beds wouldn't end long waits in emergency wards. He says the problem is "bigger than that."</p>
<p>The Fraser Institute says at least many provinces are now monitoring, collecting and publishing wait-time data, although Alberta's wait-time registry has been out of service since last summer. Duckett has promised current wait times for specific procedures at many hospitals will be posted online, with updates every fiscal quarter. The province and Alberta Health Services also plan to launch a new wait list registry this fall to improve transparency.</p>
<p>While we applaud those efforts, Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall has put his political career on the line, boldly promising to reduce all surgical wait times to three months within four years. He says the health-care system has been "unduly handcuffed by dogma and ideology and philosophy" and that his plan is "bold, but doable." And he has stressed that no one will be able to pay to jump the queue.</p>
<p>Wait times in Saskatchewan are longer than Alberta, but they actually dropped this year to 25.2 weeks, from 28.8 weeks in 2008.</p>
<p>Where should we be looking for models to follow?Ontario recorded the shortest wait time in the Fraser Institute survey at 12.5 weeks, down from 13.3 in 2008. Manitoba was second at 14.3 weeks, down from 17.2, and Quebec was third at 16.6 weeks, down from 18.7.</p>
<p>The Alberta Health website compares Alberta wait times in only a few categories to the Canadian average. It doesn't tell Albertans whether it is making progress or not. Albertans deserve better than that. They deserve to know what progress is being made and how the objectives will be achieved. And they are likely expecting there to be more on the line than a performance bonus.</p>

<p>An H1N1 vaccine available in Britain for people suffering from severe egg allergies will not be used in Canada because it has not received regulatory approval.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency said it has not considered purchasing the second type of vaccine, which is safer for people with egg allergies.</p>
<p>Most swine flu doses in Canada were purchased from GlaxoSmith-Kline, which produces the vaccine by growing the influenza virus in a chicken egg.</p>

<p>Liberal party president Alfred Apps suggested Monday that the H1N1 crisis is Prime Minister Stephen Harper's "hurricane Katrina," a metaphor that outraged Conservatives.</p>
<p>In an e-mail circulated to dozens of Liberals, Apps lambasted Harper for failing to act quickly enough to make sure any Canadian who wanted a vaccine for H1N1 had access to one.</p>
<p>"Is the H1N1 pandemic the hurricane Katrina of our own laissez-faire, fend-for-yourself government?" Apps asked. "It's as though (Harper's) strategy, if not to turn a blind eye to the threat altogether, was simply to do the bare minimum and hope the problem would go away."</p>

<p>A 25-year old Calgary man who was dedicated to church and worked as a technical writer for Shaw Cable has died from complications with H1N1, his family said Monday.</p>
<p>Jonathan Evan Harris died last Thursday. Alberta Health Services won't confirm Harris died from H1N1, citing privacy laws, but they did announce Friday that an adult male from the Calgary area had died of the swine flu.</p>
<p>There have been 14 deaths in Alberta from H1N1.</p>

<p>A pickup truck full of flowers and hockey-stick-shaped wreaths decorated funeral services for Evan Frustaglio, the 13-year-old Toronto boy who captured the nation's heart after he died of swine flu last week.</p>
<p>At a solemn Catholic mass Monday, Evan's father, Paul Frustaglio, delivered a eulogy to his young son, a boy he described as his best friend.</p>
<p>"It amazes me that Evan's death has captured a nation trying to find answers to a disease that is currently wearing the face of our beautiful son," Frustaglio said at the pulpit with his wife, Ann-Marie, and Evan's younger brother, Will, 10.</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people attended the service; Evan's hockey teammates, classmates, family and friends filled every pew. His teammates wore their jerseys and sat together in the church's front pews on either side of the family.</p>
<p>Nearly 20,000 people have joined a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> memorial page dedicated to the boy.</p>
<p>During the hour-plus service, Rev. Vito Marziliano asked those in attendance to refrain from shaking hands during the exchange of the sign of peace--a measure that has been introduced at many Canadian churches to discourage the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>Evan's sudden death is credited with putting a human face on H1N1 virus and prompting people to stand in long lines across the country for the vaccine. Clinics in Toronto opened the day he died.</p>
<p>Evan developed a sore throat and fever during a hockey tournament in London, Ont., where he was playing with his minor bantam AA team, the Mississauga North Stars. He and his mother returned home to Toronto and visited a walk-in clinic, where they were assured he simply had the flu. The following morning, he collapsed in the bathroom of the Frustaglios' home; his father gave him CPR, but he was pronounced dead at St. Joseph's Health Centre. A robust hockey player, he had no health conditions.</p>
<p>The family has established two memorial funds at Humber Valley Village School and the Hill Academy, a school for elite athletes that Evan last attended, in honour of their son.</p>

<p>Here's what some visitors to edmontonjournal.com</p>
<p>had to say about the long lineups for the H1N1 vaccination in Alberta: - Every time I drove past the massive lineups last week I wondered how many people are going to get sick just because they stood in line in this cold weather waiting to get the vaccine. We could have more serious illnesses and deaths resulting from the waiting than from H1N1 causes, especially with all the seniors I saw waiting in line.</p>
<p>--Len H. - OK stelmach, Liepert, Duckett and Coriveau, please stand in front of the people of Alberta and read the following: "I am truly sorry for pretending to know what I am doing. I realize now that I am in way over my head and have resigned my position. I will not accept any severance pay, buyout or bonus of any kind. I beg your forgiveness and apologize for the debacle that I have helped to create." If you only had the integrity!</p>
<p>--OK Stelmach - I am so glad that finally flu clinics will be available for only those at great risk. For the past four weeks I have been wanting to get flu shots for myself and my children. We are all high-risk people. I have two children under five, my youngest is diagnosed with asthma. I have a 12-year-old son who also has asthma. I myself am pregnant and also have asthma. I have been hospitalized in the last month for my asthma, which is why we have been unable to stand outside for hours waiting for the shot. It is very upsetting to read about these "high-risk" people who need the flu shot, yet when you go no one cares whether you are high-risk or not. They all want their flu shots. I am just pleased that finally we may be able to get our shots without waiting for hours.</p>
<p>--Angeldae - My hat goes off to my fellow nurses. Great job with managing the mass immunization clinics. Congratulations to the stelmach government for once again proving that they are completely incompetent when it comes to making important, intelligent decisions. I guess it has to be an oil and gas or corporate disaster to make them wake up. Wow, the Alberta Advantage ... what a joke. I bet Mr. stelmach, Ron Liepert and Dr. Duckett didn't wait in any lines for their H1N1 vaccine. This whole fiasco is a complete disgrace and reflection on our government's inability to manage a crisis of this magnitude. Oh yeah and Dr. Duckett says we don't have a nursing shortage. shame on all of you. I just hope Albertans remember this at election time because I think the PCs are going to be finally sent packing. Long overdue if you ask me.</p>
<p>--Frustrated health-care worker - Why don't you people stop your crying over the vaccine. The government did state before the vaccines came out ... HIGH RIsK GROUPs FIRsT. you all had to come running for the vaccine shot. The blame is on yourselves for not listening to the government to begin with. I agree with our health minister to shut down the clinics. Albertans needs to get their heads together and start relaxing over this H1N1 flu. Only 14 confirmed deaths since May out of a population of over three million Albertans. We get that much or more every year in a regular flu season. Let's CHILL.</p>
<p>--Annoyed - I have no problem with the speed of the vaccinations as there is little that the government can do to speed production. The organization of this thing was a farce, though. It's very, very easy to imagine how it could have been done better. I mean, it was clear that there were going to be long lineups, could they not have booked places that could accommodate them indoors?</p>
<p>--Bob N - I agree with the parents who think the vaccine should have been given in the schools. My daughter is in Grade 8 and there have been two confirmed cases in her school. I look at them as high-risk because of the proximity of the students in the classes. Now it's going to be at least a week or more before she can get her shot. I think by then it will be too late. Either she'll get the virus or it will be a closed school, therefore interrupting her education. Maybe the government should go back to school and learn how the system works there. If they spent a day in the school, they would want their vaccine right away!</p>
<p>--Concerned Parent - What part of "no more vaccine" do you not understand? Demand outstrips supply and it's not like the government is hoarding it. Alberta gets what is available to it. Every province has the same problem and apparently the same whiners. The "ME FIRsT" attitude sure comes out here. --R. U. Stupid?</p>

</p>
<p>In the last week, critics say, government members have sent mixed messages when trying to explain Alberta's H1N1 immunization strategy.</p>
<p>OCT. 26</p>
<p>-"Mass clinics started delivering the vaccine across Alberta today, focusing on the high-risk groups first. . . . No one will be turned away at the clinics, but we are aiming to have those groups who can benefit the most come forward first. . . . I urge all Albertans to go out and get immunized."</p>
<p>--Health Minister Ron Liepert</p>
<p>-"Over the course of time the vaccine will be available for all Albertans, but we're asking those that are more susceptible to the flu to receive their vaccine today. We'll ensure that all other Albertans, including those that may not be at risk as much as others, receive their vaccine in the province." --Premier Ed stelmach</p>
<p>OCT. 27</p>
<p>-"To those Albertans who lined up yesterday for several hours I would express my apologies. . . . The overwhelming turnout . . . on Day 1 clearly caught most people by surprise."</p>
<p>--Liepert</p>
<p>-"Many who weren't considered high risk felt they wanted to be protected, and that's not a bad thing. but it clearly did create situations yesterday that were unacceptable and we're going to work toward making sure that we take corrective action." --Liepert</p>
<p>OCT. 28</p>
<p>-"We're the province that is offering flu vaccines for every Albertan, not just to the high-risk groups." --stelmach</p>
<p>OCT. 29</p>
<p>-"We're not asking only those highrisk groups to get the vaccine first. It's open to all."</p>
<p>--stelmach</p>
<p>OCT. 30</p>
<p>-"We encouraged all Albertans to get vaccinated. They absolutely took it up by the thousands immediately."</p>
<p>--Liepert</p>
<p>-"The message has been consistent from Day 1. We have asked only the high-risk Albertans to attend the clinics. That has never changed."</p>
<p>--Liepert</p>
<p>-"The message isn't any different today than it was four days ago. We would encourage those who are not at high risk to be patient and wait, those who are at high risk, please go and get your vaccination."</p>
<p>--Liepert</p>
<p>NOV. 2</p>
<p>-"This province has vaccinated 400,000 Albertans of all categories --all categories--in terms of high risk and low risk. They did their civic duty. yes, they stood in line, but you know what? That's 400,000 more people that have a vaccination, that are now at little or no risk."</p>
<p>--stelmach</p>
<p>-"High priority Albertans will now be high priority."</p>
<p>--Liepert</p>
<p>-"Any time you can vaccinate 400,000 people in six days, that's a tremendous success." --Liepert</p>

</p>
<p>Nineteen years ago, Wendy Mathewson was in a coma for six weeks after being involved in a car accident. She was hit in the head by a flying object during the crash, sustaining a serious brain injury.</p>
<p>When she came out of the coma, she couldn't walk, talk or write.</p>
<p>But, amazingly, Mathewson was still able to do one thing--swim.</p>
<p>"I'll never forget that day when she went in the water for the first time after her accident," her father Bill said. "We took her to Coronation Pool and wanted her to stay by the side for support. She swam a length of the pool, straight as an arrow."</p>
<p>It was a great day for the Mathewsons-- like the day last week when they picked up Wendy from the Edmonton International Airport.</p>
<p>The 49-year-old Edmonton woman, who has now regained her speech and is able to walk again, came home from the 2009 Masters Games in Australia with three gold medals in the 45-to 49-year-old age category. She struck gold in the 50-metre backstroke, 50m breaststroke and the 50m butterfly.</p>
<p>"It makes me feel young again and gives me drive," Mathewson said of her swimming training and competitive success. "Life goes better with a job. This is like my job for the last three months. This was the most important thing."</p>
<p>Mathewson swims at the Edmonton Masters Swim Club and, all told, the club brought home 16 medals from Australia. Her performance in Sydney last month matched her efforts when the Masters Games were held in Edmonton in 2005.</p>
<p>"After I won the gold medals in Edmonton, I said right away that I was going to Australia," she said.</p>
<p>When asked if she plans to compete in the next Games in Italy, in 2014, Mathewson said, "You bet." - For the second year in a row, Team Canada West lost its opening game in the World Junior A Hockey Challenge. They dropped a 2-1 to decision to Russia on Sunday at the prestigious eight-day tournament being held this year in Summerside, P.E.I.</p>
<p>"Since this is such a short tournament we have to put this loss behind us quickly and prepare for our game against Sweden," St. Albert Steel forward Daniel Carr said. "The game was disappointing for the team, but we are continuing to learn and we must get better every day to be successful."</p>
<p>Carr is making his first appearance in the six-team event. Four other Alberta Junior Hockey League players--Cody Kunyk, Sherwood Park Crusaders;Ben Gallacher, Camrose Kodiaks; Tanner Fritz, Grande Prairie Storm; and John Gunbar of the Calgary Canucks--are on the team. Along with Canada West, other teams are Russia, Sweden, Canada East, Belarus and the U.S.</p>
<p>Fritz is the only returning player from last year's team, which bounced back after losing its first game and picked up a silver medal. - Three AJHL games were cancelled on Sunday, not because of any rampant H1N1 virus or anything like that, but because the refs didn't show up. "Unfortunately a clerical error occurred, and as a result there were no game officials assigned to the three AJHL games," explained league president Craig Cripps. "All games will be rescheduled promptly."</p>
<p>One game that was played on Sunday was between the Spruce Grove Saints and the Steel in St. Albert. Ryan Kerr scored the game winner in overtime for the Saints when St. Albert was whistled for a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty. - Storm forward Zahn Raubenheimer, 20, was named AJHL player of the week. He had five goals and two assists in a pair of games to extend his eight-game goal scoring streak. - Team Alberta captured gold in the first-ever Western Canada U-16 Challenge Cup, which wrapped up Sunday in Blackfalds. Alberta came back from a two-goal deficit to edge Team Manitoba 6-4 in the exciting final.</p>
<p>Edmonton's Branden Troock was named a tournament all-star, along with Team Alberta defenceman Matt Dumba and goalie Devon Fordyce. - Jetlan Houcher, 15, of the Lloydminster Tanroc Bobcats tallied six goals and two assists to lead his team to two more victories in Alberta Midget Hockey League action.

</p>
<p>According to the government of Quebec's two-page spread in Monday's Gazette, I am more at risk of getting the H1N1 bug if I live in Laval than if I live in Montreal.</p>
<p>I'm a healthy woman in her 40s with two children, ages 6 and 11. In Montreal, children 6 months to 5 years of age and their immediate families can get the vaccine as of Nov. 9, but families with children over 5 must wait until Dec. 7. In Laval, children 6 months to 9 years old, their parents, and siblings, can be immunized as of Nov. 15.</p>
<p>In Montreal, my over-65 year-old mother who has no chronic illness falls into the low-priority Dec. 7 group as well. In Laval, anyone over 65 can get the vaccine from Nov. 22. Guess we'll be loading up the van for a day-trip to lovely Laval. Too bad it's not picnic weather.</p>

<p>I have chronic lung problems requiring steroid pump treatments if I get the flu. Montrealers with such a chronic condition have to wait until Nov. 23 to get their vaccine. Yet people in Gatineau with chronic conditions can get the H1N1 vaccine as early as Nov. 9.</p>
<p>Why? It's no surprise that we lack confidence in our provincial and city health officials to look after us. No wonder there are line-jumpers.  People are not being treated equally in Quebec.</p>

</div><div>Richard J. Dalton Jr. and Darah Hansen   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>612 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>H1N1 is straining not only health care services, but also health care workers.</p>
<p>As many as a quarter of the BC Women's Hospital & Health Centre nurses who provide care before and after labour were out sick with cold or flu symptoms for several days last week, said Marisa Nichini, communications director for the hospital.</p>
<p>Service wasn't interrupted as other staff filled in.</p>
<p>"So far, BC Women's has been able to deal with the absenteeism as it hasn't been across all programs and departments at the hospital and not for long periods of time, but it is a strain on the system -- especially for the staff who are covering the shifts," Nichini said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>The hospital allows workers to return seven days after the onset of symptoms or once the symptoms have completely gone away, she said.</p>
<p>The hospital has exercised special caution as pregnant women are at a higher risk of complications from H1N1.</p>
<p>"With respect to the entire maternity centre, we have to be cautious, both for the safety of our patients and for the safety of our staff," Nichini said.</p>
<p>Ryan Jabs, spokesman for the Ministry of Health Services, said there has been an increase in absenteeism in many health authorities. "We are seeing the affects of H1N1 on our system and our health care workers," he said via e-mail.</p>
<p>While the system is coping, pressure is increasing both in emergency departments and critical care areas across the province, said Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon. He said health authorities are under further stress from increasing absenteeism.</p>
<p>Jabs said emergency departments have been busy with influenza-like illnesses, and a quarter of those admitted to hospital with H1N1 are moved to intensive care units.</p>
<p>Paramedics now ask patients if they have a fever or cough. If so, paramedics don protective gear, including respirators, goggles, gowns and possibly face shields, said Dr. Karen Wanger, BC Ambulance Service medical director for the Lower Mainland.</p>
<p>Firefighters have also added a special flu-fighting mask to their emergency equipment as concerns grow over the spread of the potentially deadly H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"We're taking this very seriously," said Capt. Gabe Roder of Vancouver Fire and Rescue.</p>
<p>On the advice of the department's physician, Dr. Allan Holmes, firefighters are now taking extra precautions on calls in which H1N1 is suspected.</p>
<p>Emergency crews, trained to recognize symptoms of the virus, must conduct a "doorway" survey to determine if the flu may be present. If that's determined to be the case, crews will add a medical mask to their regular emergency equipment, including gloves and goggles.</p>
<p>Roder said some of the department's 800 firefighters have tested positive for H1N1, but not in significant numbers.</p>
<p>Like everyone else in the province, emergency crew members are being asked to stay home if they feel sick, rather than reporting to work, Roder said.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Vancouver Police Department said there have been no confirmed cases of H1N1 among staff members.</p>
<p>RCMP officers are being advised to stay off the job if they are ill, RCMP Corp. Annie Linteau said. Information has also been posted on an internal website to advise officers of flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Linteau said police are already well-equipped to deal with various potential health problems out in the field, adding all officers carry medical masks as well as gloves and goggles, if required.</p>
<p>"We are being affected, just like everyone else in the province," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Striking paramedics face a government- imposed contract; Health Services Minister cites H1N1, mounting stress on health care system</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Fowlie   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>824 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Health Services Minister Kevin Falcon took a key first step Monday toward imposing a new contract on B.C.'s striking paramedics, citing risks to patients because of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>While apologizing for the move, Falcon introduced the back-to-work legislation, saying it was necessary because of mounting stresses on the health care system, ranging from burned-out ambulance managers to the growing demands of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"The entire health system is operating at full capacity to manage the impact of the H1N1 pandemic," Falcon said Monday after introducing the Ambulance Services Collective Agreement Act.</p>
<p>"Every day the strike continues increases the risk to patients and it's my view we cannot go another day with our ambulance paramedics system operating at less than its full potential."</p>
<p>The move comes with less than a month to go in the current legislative session -- likely the last regular sitting of the house before the 2010 Winter Olympic Games.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation prescribes a three-per-cent wage increase over one year -- the same amount the B.C. Ambulance Service offered the union on Sept. 28 -- with the contract retroactive to April 1.</p>
<p>Falcon said he will also call on Minister of Labour Murray Coell to appoint an industrial inquiry commissioner as soon as possible to review issues such as the current labour relations structure.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Canadian Union of Public Employees Local 873, which represents the province's 3,500 paramedics and dispatchers, attacked the move.</p>
<p>"Our question is, why now?" asked BJ Chute, noting the union membership is now voting on the employer's Sept. 28 offer, with results due later this week.</p>
<p>"What happened to democracy here?"</p>
<p>Chute said he believes one of the main reasons for the legislation is to avoid having paramedics striking during the Olympics.</p>
<p>But Falcon said the move is about safety.</p>
<p>"While the labour negotiation process is important to me -- and it is -- I have a larger issue I'm concerned about," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry it had to come to this, but we're very concerned about making sure that British Columbians are taken care of during a challenging time."</p>
<p>Falcon said that since the strike began seven months ago, the average number of out-of-service ambulances in the Lower Mainland has jumped to 150 per month from 12.</p>
<p>He said despite an existing essential services order, some workers have not been showing up for work or not responding to call-ins. He said managers have had to carry extra loads as a result, with some working up to 80 hours per week.</p>
<p>Falcon noted that CUPE Local 873 president John Strohmaier had called the Sept. 28 offer a "piece of crap."</p>
<p>"There is a vote going on, but I think in this business we also have to be realistic," said Falcon.</p>
<p>In an internal memo to his membership following the Sept. 28 offer, Strohmaier recommended members vote it down.</p>
<p>Paramedics have been on strike in B.C. since April 1.</p>
<p>According to news releases, both sides have agreed to a three-per-cent wage increase.</p>
<p>The union has asked for an extra 1.2-per-cent labour market adjustment, similar to what B.C. nurses were given.</p>
<p>The union has also asked for a signing bonus, similar to what the government offered other public-sector workers who reached new deals before the end of their previous contracts.</p>
<p>The Ambulance Service had said it is not willing to offer the bonus, as that was offered only to unions that signed without striking.</p>
<p>Falcon said the Ambulance Service will not offer a labour market adjustment, but is still willing to add another 1.2-per-cent increase, provided that extra savings can be found within the existing contract.</p>
<p>New Democratic Party leader Carole James said she will vote against the legislation because she feels the government should have long ago used binding arbitration to settle the dispute.</p>

</p>
<p>The province announced Monday it will grant doctors special permission to advise patients by telephone during the H1N1 outbreak. Health Minister Deb Matthews said the special dispensation, along with the assessment centres, are part of a strategy to alleviate pressure on Ontario's stretched system.</p>
<p>Telehealth Ontario, the province's telephone consultation service, has been snowed under since concerns about H1N1 vaccinations spiked unexpectedly one week ago, when two healthy children died. Doctors will bill OHIP $11 for each conversation under 10 minutes. Longer conversations will be billed at $27.55. Matthews says allowing physicians to charge for the consults will give patients a more reliable alternative to Telehealth. "(It's) just to ask the doctor, 'These are the symptoms of my child, what should I do? Should I come in and see you, should I go to emerg, should I take care of them at home?' " she said. "Telehealth certainly offers that service, but I think your own family doctor might have a better sense of what's best for you."</p>

</p>
<p>A 26-year-old Gatineau woman died of H1N1 Saturday, becoming the first flu-related fatality in the Outaouais in the second wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The woman suffered from chronic health problems, said Céline Jacob, a spokeswoman for Outaouais health and social services.</p>
<p>The woman had not received a flu shot, Jacob said. She died in a medical facility.</p>
<p>No additional information on the woman's medical history was available. Her name was not released.</p>
<p>Jacob said there were 221 confirmed H1N1 cases in the Outaouais as of Friday, but only a handful of patients are being treated in hospital.</p>
<p>More vaccination clinics are to open in the coming days but Outaouais citizens who do not fall into any of the priority groups could wait weeks before they are eligible for flu shots.</p>
<p>The two Gatineau clinics remain reserved for women more than 20 weeks' pregnant, children aged six months to five years, and people who live with children who are less than six months old. On Nov. 9, a new clinic will open at Place Cartier for pregnant women, young children and their caregivers, health workers and people under 65 with chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Clinics in the Gatineau, des Collines and Vallée-de-la-Gatineau regions have yet to specify when they will open to the general public.</p>
<p>In the Pontiac region, the public will be eligible for vaccinations as of Nov. 9 at clinics in Shawville, Campbell's Bay, Chapeau, Fort Coulonge, Rapides-des-Joachims and Quyon.</p>
<p>The Shawville clinic (516 Main Road) is open Wednesdays with one Saturday clinic to run on Nov. 28 only; the Campbell's Bay clinic (2 Secord Road) is open Mondays; the Chapeau clinic (64 Pembroke Road) is open Fridays; the Fort-Coulonge clinic (525 Baume Road) is open Tuesdays, with one Saturday clinic to run on Nov. 28; the Rapides-des-Joachims clinic (48 de l'Église Road) is open only on Nov. 9, and the Quyon clinic (1 Ferry Road) is open Thursdays.</p>
<p>All clinics open at 10 a.m.</p>

</p>
<p>Kids are the hardest, even for a seasoned nurse like Betty-Ann Hamilton.</p>
<p>"They're crying and squirming and going, 'No! No!' It upsets all of us. You know it's good, but it's going to hurt them. It's good, but it's bad."</p>
<p>Hamilton, 52, is an Ottawa public health nurse. She is part of the team at the City of Ottawa flu clinic in Fred Barrett Arena in Gloucester.</p>
<p>Here, the H1N1 vaccines are administered in a noisy and crowded second-floor reception room overlooking the ice rink.</p>
<p>Speaking over the shrieks of children, Hamilton chokes up recalling her toughest case so far.</p>
<p>"I had a mum in here breastfeeding her baby. She was crying because she was worried she was making the wrong decision. She was afraid because it was (her) first baby and you want everything to be perfect for your first baby.</p>
<p>"It really touched me because I'm a mum, too."</p>
<p>The first day the clinic opened, on Monday, Oct. 26, was "very emotional," she recalls.</p>
<p>"It was upsetting the first day, with all the crowds. You turn them away and they've been waiting. We're upset because we can't help them. We're so busy. We're trying our best and so many people were angry and frustrated."</p>
<p>Is the job a strain? "Big time," she says.</p>
<p>On the drive home, Hamilton searches the radio for relaxing music.</p>
<p>"You need to disengage. When you get home, you're so wired, you can't sleep for a while. Then you calm down, think about the day, how to make it better, how to make people go through faster, but also safer."</p>
<p>A University of Ottawa graduate and the daughter of a nurse, Hamilton's real job is managing fitness programs for seniors.</p>
<p>For example, she's the go-to person for 27 volunteers at The Friendly Corner at St. Laurent Shopping Centre, which offers mallwalking, strength training and health talks for older people.</p>
<p>The last time Hamilton gave an injection was 29 years ago in 1980, when she worked at the former Ottawa Civic Hospital. "It's something you don't forget, but some of the steps get fine-tuned."</p>
<p>"When I learned, you always aspirate (the syringe). Now we don't. That's a big change for me."</p>
<p>To prepare, she observed Grade 7 immunization clinics last week and also took online training.</p>
<p>"This is what nurses in public health are good at," says Hamilton.</p>
<p>"We're good with people. We know we're making a difference and people have confidence in us. They know we're doing this for all the right reasons.</p>
<p>"Even though there's a lot of stuff out in the media, we know our facts are based in research and best practice and all of that makes us feel good.</p>
<p>"And people want it. They're here because they want it and we're giving them what they want, so that feels really good."</p>
<p>On Monday, she wore three caps; she was back-up supervisor and a float nurse, ready to jump in when any of the 15 nurses giving immunizations went on break.</p>
<p>She was also an assessor; answering questions about a person's suitability to receive the shot that day.</p>
<p>There's a staff meeting, supplies to order and to unpack and questions coming from all directions. "It goes fast."</p>
<p>Clinic supervisor Lorette Dupuis says Hamilton is well-suited to the pressure-cooker job. "She's calm. She's got experience. She's got a great personality and kids of her own; she can relate to a mum's point of view."</p>
<p>The nurses giving shots sit at long tables; each has a computer and a tray containing alcohol, band-aids, cotton balls, syringes, tissues and hand sanitizer. There are also pink disposal boxes for sharps, and stuffed toys.</p>
<p>The vaccine arrives in coolers every hour. It must be maintained at between 2C and 8C and is good for 24 hours. An assistant gets it ready for the nurses, who pick it up from a table and load their own syringes.</p>
<p>Each nurse vaccinates about 15 people an hour.</p>
<p>"You have to spend a bit of time talking about what to expect and there's so much information and a bit of confusion, so that's why it takes that amount of time," Hamilton says.</p>
<p>Nurses go over the filled-out questionnaire, talk to the patient about risk factors and try to confirm that they are appropriate candidates. They cleanse the left shoulder in anyone over a year old (in babies it's the left thigh).</p>
<p>"The actual injection part takes seconds, in and out," says Hamilton.</p>
<p>The sign of a great injection is when the person says, "Oh, you already done?" she says with a laugh.</p>
<p>Lines form at 4 a.m. and the arena opens at 6 a.m. Hamilton sees daily improvements in the system: "It's so much better since we've had Parks and Recreation step in to control the crowd. It's really been a City of Ottawa team effort.</p>
<p>"People come in and they're given a wristband. They go up to information. The Parks and Rec people screen them. They tell people what time to come back.</p>
<p>"You know what it's like when you're waiting and you have children and you're anxious and tempers are a little bit short. But for the most part, now that people are clear on what time to come back, it's way better.</p>
<p>"It's been really nice because we've had people here in lineups and they see how busy we are and they want to help. They come up to us after and say, 'Listen, I'm a nurse. Can I help?' or 'I can volunteer.'"</p>
<p>The greatest pleasure is the teamwork. "We're united in one goal to get these people through. Everybody's working together.</p>
<p>"We have people coming up saying 'Thanks very much. You're doing a good job.' That means a lot."</p>

Hamilton admits the job can be a strain. 'When you get home, you're

<p>As a resident of Osgoode, I was very disappointed and angry that by 10:35 a.m. on Friday, the City of Ottawa announced that the H1N1 flu clinic in Osgoode, which was supposed to have opened at 2:30 p.m., was full. My daughter, Sarah at seven months old is on the high priority list. I patiently waited my turn for the roving clinic to come to Osgoode, and I did not take up space in lines at earlier clinics in Kanata, Orléans, Nepean or elsewhere in the city. However, people from all over the city drove to Osgoode early to get the shot. Obviously, there aren't enough clinics in the city, and the demand is higher than the clinics are able to accommodate.</p>
<p>The process is new, and there is some trial and error involved to get the system up and running efficiently. However, courtesy and common sense would be appreciated, but apparently during a pandemic all decency goes out the window and it's every person for themselves.</p>
<p>I have no problem with health-care workers getting the shot wherever they are able to, as we need them to be healthy and on the front lines to deal with this crisis. I hope that future clinics held in the rural areas are actually available to rural residents, and that everyone else waits for their turn.</p>

<p>Re: Hospital staff bring family to workplace vaccine clinic, Nov. 1.</p>
<p>The Ottawa Hospital was wrong to vaccinate family members who are not in the five high-risk categories, especially given the scarcity of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>I cannot believe that Nicolas Ruszkowski, The Ottawa Hospital's vice-president of communications and outreach, thought that there was an ethical question regarding turning away family members. By vaccinating them, the hospital took scarce vaccine away from people in the high-risk categories, including other hospital workers.</p>
<p>As someone with a chronic medical condition, I was vaccinated last Wednesday at the Orléans clinic. Waiting in the auditorium, I heard a volunteer asking if anyone was older than 65. Several people raised their hands, including the gentleman in front of me. The volunteer then spoke with each person. I heard her tell this man that he was not in one of the high-risk groups and he should leave to allow the vaccine to be available for those who were. Without any argument, he did leave.</p>
<p>However, later, after being registered, I was waiting for the shot and noticed several groups of three to eight people being led to the front of the line. In each case, one of them was a health-care worker with an identification card and the rest were obvious family members; for example a mother with teenage daughters. I have absolutely no problem with health-care workers getting their vaccinations ahead of me or others in the high-risk categories as they are on the front lines.</p>
<p>But it is wrong and unethical to abuse their positions to get their families vaccinated at the same time when there are thousands of others in the high-risk categories who need the vaccine ahead of their family members.</p>

<p>My daughter and I are in the high-risk group to take the H1N1 vaccine. I had been monitoring the situation via the Internet, newspaper and TV news. I was frankly dreading the ordeal ahead of us.</p>
<p>We got up early Saturday, arrived at the Richelieu-Vanier Community Centre at 6:45 a.m. and received our two bracelets by 7 a.m. We returned at the time (11 a.m.) assigned to us, went from being processed through our tent, to the interview room and finally to the gym, where we waited 15 minutes for the shot.</p>
<p>Bravo Vanier-Richelieu! From the focused, friendly, in-control guy who gave us our initial briefing in the tent at 7 a.m., to the efficient interviewing staff and onward to the staff in the tents and gym who moved us around and then to our nurse who administered the shot -- kudos for a job well done. Congrats also to the city and province for realizing and fixing the problems of the previous week.</p>

<p>I am reminded of the Peanuts cartoon, where Lucy always pulls away the football just as Charlie Brown is about to kick it. That's how I feel now that the Ontario government has announced it will suspend offering H1N1 flu shots to the general population until the supply increases. What did governments expect when they encouraged citizens to seek inoculations? That people would not turn out? I despair. They're the gang that can't shoot straight ... into our arms.</p>

<p>Re: "Homeless Calgarians begin receiving H1N1 vaccinations," Oct. 30.</p>
<p>Only in Calgary would the elderly, pregnant women, small children and those who work in health care or childcare be required to line up outside at 3 a.m. to get a chance at the H1N1 shot. But the homeless are hand-delivered their shots right to their shelters. At least, they are being protected. What a wasted opportunity to cure the homelessness problem in Calgary. Where are the province's priorities to productive and taxpaying members of society?</p>

<p>Re: "Too few clinics," Editorial, Oct. 30.</p>
<p>I am a recently retired registered nurse. I have more than 40 years experience (including giving flu shots).Why were neither myself nor any of my retired colleagues contacted to help with the H1N1 vaccine administration? We could have attended an in-service to be brought up to speed and possibly saved many Albertans hours spent in long lineups. I did phone to offer my services, but no one returned my call.</p>

<p>Re: "H1N1 clinics now only for high-risk Albertans," Nov. 1.</p>
<p>I have a chronic health condition and have been receiving flu shots regularly. Unfortunately, I turned 65 in July and will not be considered to be high risk when the new rules for H1N1 shots go into effect this week and exclude seniors. I guess we all should feel comforted knowing that our medical problems miraculously disappear at 65.</p>

<p>The Centers for Disease Control and the Public Health Agency of Canada recommend continued breastfeeding for mothers who catch or are exposed to H1N1. The virus is not known to pass through breast milk. Mothers who mix feed with artificial milks and breast milk should increase their breastfeeding for further protection of the baby. La Leche League Canada is not recommending sneezing into the arm or elbow because of the child's position during breastfeeding. Antiviral drugs are compatible with pregnancy and breastfeeding. Breastfeeding provides targeted immunoglobins against H1N1, and fat and lactoferrin are two of innumerable passive antiviral factors. For youngsters six months and under, breastfeeding is essential protection. For those over this age and eligible to be vaccinated, breast milk is an invaluable adjunct to lower the risk of infection, or if they do contract the virus, moderate the illness.</p>

<p>I am outraged at the arrogance and lack of accountability Health Minister Ron Liepert is demonstrating. His rebuttal is a blatant attempt at political spin to save his skin. How dare he describe the clinic fiasco as a success? He successfully exposed pregnant women, small children and seniors to health risk and fatigue. He successfully confused Albertans on the most significant health pandemic in recent history. The lack of leadership shown by Liepert and Ed Stelmach makes me ashamed to ever have been a Tory supporter. That is over.</p>

<p>Minister Liepert, how can you not accept blame for the H1N1 clinic catastrophe? You have the power and position. You are the boss. Are you a yes man? What are you being paid for?</p>
<p>Do you accept whatever someone else advises without weighing the consequences? Blame the federal government, blame the manufacturers. Blame the public who has been given conflicting messages. How can the ones at risk of contracting the disease take time off from their duties at home or at work and line up for hours? What about the vulnerable, unable to drive, or without a caregiver to transport them? What about those in rural communities? Even today, you are still issuing conflicting messages. Ron, admit you are incompetent and seek some advice from the competent health workers in the front line.</p>

<p>Health Minister Ron Liepert must resign his cabinet post. He has lost the confidence of Albertans with his botched handling of the H1N1 vaccine program. The buck ultimately stops with Liepert, who sent Albertans grievously mixed messages, and deflected the blame for the long lineups and this week's clinic closures, while backtracking and flip-flopping on policy statements. He even pointed an accusing finger at the media for chronicling the confusion he is ultimately responsible for.</p>
<p>In a column published in Monday's Herald, Liepert claimed poor planning was not responsible for the chaos, but it is obvious that it was. Liepert claims vaccine availability was the real culprit--yet, that doesn't appear to have figured into the province's plans when it received 400,000 doses to kick off the program. Liepert said it was always a priority that high-risk people would get the shots first, but the message given Albertans was that nobody would be turned away, so naturally thousands of healthy people showed up to get their shots. If vaccine availability was the driving force behind the government's rollout plans, then the messages should have been tailored to reflect that.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, chief medical officer of health, said Monday that vaccinations were never targeted for the entire population, which contradicts what Premier Ed Stelmach said last week. Corriveau was appointed by the provincial government and directly reports to Liepert. That should be enough to make Albertans question how much of the buck-passing is political, but in the end, Liepert must take ultimate responsibility for the chaos. Stelmach should request Liepert's imminent departure. It would be the first demonstration of leadership shown since the vaccine fiasco unfolded. A new vaccination plan targeting high-risk people only, with strict enforcement, is to be unveiled Tuesday. Liepert's resignation deserves to be unveiled along with it.</p>

<p>A 25-year-old Calgary man who was dedicated to church and worked at Shaw Cable has died from complications of the H1N1 virus, his family said Monday.</p>
<p>Jonathan Evan Harris died Thursday at the Rockyview General Hospital.</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services won't confirm Harris died from H1N1, citing privacy laws, but they did announce Friday that an adult male from the Calgary area had died from the swine flu.</p>
<p>There have been 14 deaths in Alberta from H1N1. Harris's family declined to comment on their son's death. "Everyone is just traumatized," said his mom, Elizabeth Harris, suggesting details could be found in his obituary, which was published in Monday's Herald.</p>
<p>"Although his life was cut short, it was lived with gentleness, kindness, joy, quiet humour, wit, richness, integrity, and pure love," the tribute said.</p>
<p>Harris was also very active in his faith. His youth pastor, Sindy Jeske, said Harris was always a great man--even in his youth.</p>
<p>"One of my favourite qualities about him was his desire to be a true gentleman. This is such a rare characteristic," she said in an e-mail. "He went out of his way to treat people with dignity and respect."</p>
<p>Harris's funeral will be held at 4 p.m. Thursday at St. George's Anglican Church, 244 Templemont Dr. N.E.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province's vaccination plan a true Soviet-style debacle</b>

</p>
<p>By vaccinating only young kids and pregnant women (the swine flu plan by Monday evening) the province is completely changing its strategy for controlling the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The new plan, which is said to change shape almost hourly, was to vaccinate children under five from Thursday through Sunday.</p>
<p>Pregnant women would get their shots Friday, Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Clinics will run for those days in the big cities, but vary in length in rural areas where there isn't as much need.</p>
<p>After that, who knows? The health authorities certainly don't. This campaign could use up most of Alberta's remaining allotment of about 180,000 shots.</p>
<p>The next phase will depend on supply, say government sources, and supply is uncertain. Universal vaccination is on hold, although still planned for Christmas.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the new strategy is actually the old one recommended by the province's own pandemic plan.</p>
<p>Ignoring it proved disastrous in the face of rising demand and suddenly shrinking supply.</p>
<p>Only Alberta has been forced to close all vaccination clinics for four full days. It's still a mystery why our authorities decided to go for mass immunization rather than the more controlled approach adopted by most other provinces.</p>
<p>But there is a clue in Health Minister Ron Liepert's comment last week about avoiding "Soviet mode."</p>
<p>He was talking about his distaste for asking people to prove they're high risk in order to get a shot. But the minister soon got exactly what he dreads--a classic Soviet-mode breakdown.</p>
<p>The symptoms are familiar to anyone who spent time in the old Soviet Union.</p>
<p>First, you line up to get something the government controls by monopoly.</p>
<p>Everyone shuffles along in perfect communal equality --the healthy along with the sick, the pregnant, the very young and the very old.</p>
<p>Hours or days later you finally reach the front of the line, only to learn that somebody else got your chicken.</p>
<p>Then they close the line until some undisclosed date when distant central authorities can produce and deliver more chickens.</p>
<p>The swine flu lines went through all those stages last week. Toward the end, parts of Calgary looked like some dreary Moscow street corner in 1975.</p>
<p>The vaccine campaign has been the first real test of the province's highly centralized new health system.</p>
<p>And that system failed to predict everything important --demand, supply, group behaviour, individual needs, and regional differences.</p>
<p>On Monday, Cypress-Medicine Hat Tory Len Mitzel told the legislature he's been swamped by constituents' complaints about the lines and shutdown.</p>
<p>These Tory-to-Tory questions are always setups, but Mitzel didn't sound very friendly. He was voicing genuine and justified anger from much of rural Alberta.</p>
<p>Liepert said there were plans for rural areas, "but the tremendous take-up in mass clinics derailed that effort. There are probably some areas of the province that did get neglected and that's what we'll deal with going forward."</p>
<p>Two things happened; the cities consumed a great deal of vaccine, and many city-dwellers fled the cities for shorter lineups in rural areas.</p>
<p>Liepert and Premier Ed Stelmach point out that the province vaccinated more than 400,000 people.</p>
<p>That's important, but they've got a lot of nerve calling it a success when the system so quickly collapsed.</p>
<p>Now the province has a second chance to get it right. This time, they might try adding some concern for human beings.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Smelly, but it works; The flu is in the news, but the common cold hasn't gone away:Here are some strategies to keep it at bay</b>
</div><div>Jennifer Sygo   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>1080 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>All But Toronto</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>With all the H1N1 discourse and debate, the nation's focus is definitely on flu season. With so much attention given to the prevention and treatment of the flu, it seems that the other big winter illness -- the common cold -- is getting less attention. While the common cold is typically the gentler sickness of the two -- it still allows many to go to work and school, for example, while the flu usually lays people up for a week or more -- it is still a drain on us, both as individuals, and as a wider population.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves from getting a cold or the flu, physical barriers usually rule the day: hand-washing, not sharing cups or water bottles, or staying out of busy public places altogether are strategies that we hear about over and over again.</p>
<p>But what about your diet? Is there anything you can take that will make you less likely to get the cold? And once you're in the clutches of one, is there anything that can make a cold's duration shorter or its symptoms less severe? While there are numerous purported cold remedies on the market, here are the highlights of a few popular nutritional supplements and their possible benefits --or lack thereof--in preventing the common cold.</p>
<p>VITAMIN C</p>
<p>When it comes to cold prevention, who doesn't think about popping some vitamin C? After decades of recommendations based largely around the prevention of scurvy, vitamin C made its way into our collective consciousness with two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling's assertions that mega-dosing was a pathway to good health. Now, many of us don't think twice about popping several thousand milligrams at a time, and there is a widely held belief that taking vitamin C at the onset of a cold will hold it at bay.</p>
<p>But what does the research say? In 2007, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews -- basically, the granddaddy of evidence-based reviews on medical research -- published an updated review of vitamin C and the common cold, and found that, in a nutshell, yes, taking vitamin C regularly can reduce the length one suffers from a cold -- by 8% in adults and 14% in children. But when taken after the onset of symptoms, there was no effect on the length or severity. In other words, megadosing on vitamin C after you feel your first sniffle doesn't seem to do much.</p>
<p>Although the general population may not benefit from taking vitamin C for a cold, there is some evidence that athletes training at a high level (marathon runners, for example), and those exposed to extreme cold temperatures can benefit from popping a few pills.</p>
<p>VITAMIN D</p>
<p>The sunshine vitamin plays a role in immune system function, and at least according to early evidence, it might help to prevent respiratory tract infections. In fact, a study published in the February edition of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine found that individuals with a lower circulating level of vitamin D had a higher likelihood of developing a respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a more recent study, published in the October issue of Epidemiology and Infection, found that subjects given 2000 IU of vitamin D over a 12 week period were no less likely to develop a respiratory tract infection. Since there is very limited research on the role vitamin D plays in the development of the common cold, the bottom line is that we simply don't yet know enough to be able to do anything but speculate. Having said that, since so many Canadians are vitamin D deficient by late fall or early winter -- the time when cold and flu season hits full stride -- taking a vitamin D supplement probably isn't a bad idea, even if it is for other health benefits than cold prevention.</p>
<p>GARLIC</p>
<p>Long used by numerous cultures for taste and health, garlic's antimicrobial and antiviral properties has earned it a reputation as a classic cold-fighter. But does the evidence agree? According to a Cochrane review published earlier this year, researchers found that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that garlic should be used to either prevent or treat the common cold. Bear in mind, however, that the issue was not so much that garlic isn't useful, but rather that there haven't been enough well-controlled trials to allow a clear conclusion to be drawn, one way or the other.</p>
<p>In fact, in one double-blinded trial, subjects given garlic pills containing 180 mg of allicin (the active compound in garlic) for 12 weeks developed only a third as many colds as those given a placebo (dummy pill) for the same amount of time. Since double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials are considered the gold standard for proof, the results would certainly suggest that garlic has a role to play, at least in cold prevention, but more good trials are needed.</p>
<p>ZINC</p>
<p>A known immune system modulator, there is some research to suggest that zinc can be used to manage respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, and the common cold. While there is some indication that zinc supplements might be most beneficial for children and the elderly -- in other words, those with weakened or compromised immune systems -- the data is inconsistent.</p>
<p>As for the benefits of using zinc lozenges to treat the common cold, the reviewers at Cochrane deemed the data inconclusive. Yes, there are several well-controlled trials, and some have demonstrated that zinc lozenges can, in fact, reduce the duration or the severity of the common cold, others have shown no effect. The difference could be the result of the type of zinc used and its bioavailability (the ability of the body to uptake and use a particular form of a nutrient), but the possibility of bias was also raised. - Jennifer Sygo is a dietitian in private practice at Cleveland Clinic Canada ( clevelandcliniccanada.com),which offers executive physicals, prevention and wellness counselling and personal health care management in Toronto.</p>

</p>
<p>With hundreds of mourners packing a church yesterday for the funeral of Evan Frustaglio, the 13-year-old hockey player who died of H1N1 flu last week, his family acknowledged the unusual impact of his death.</p>
<p>"It truly amazes me that Evan's death has captured a nation trying to find answers to a disease that is currently wearing the face of Evan Frustaglio," said Paul Frustaglio, Evan's father, who stood at the pulpit with his wife, Ann-Marie, and Evan's younger brother, Will, 10.</p>
<p>"We must remain strong from our loss and all become educated on a disease that took our son's life."</p>
<p>Mr. Frustaglio read a letter sent to him by a stranger in the wake of his son's death. The man had sat next to the Frustaglios at a steak restaurant as they celebrated Evan's 13th birthday just a few weeks ago. The man noticed Evan because of the mature way he counselled his brother on the importance of an education during the meal.</p>
<p>"You spoke with a knowledge well beyond your 13 years. I was also impressed to have seen such a young man ordering escargot. I had the same appetizer. I knew right there that you had a taste for the finer things in life," the man wrote in his letter, prompting chuckles from the crowd.</p>
<p>"I didn't know you but I remember that you left a lasting impression on me that night for some unknown reason. Not sure if it was the way you spoke; you spoke the way a father should be speaking to his son, and you my friend were speaking that way to your brother."</p>
<p>More than 1,500 people attended the service at All Saints Catholic Church; Evan's teammates, classmates, family and friends filled every wooden pew. His hockey teammates wore their jerseys and sat together in the front, on either side of the family.</p>
<p>Mr. Frustaglio wiped tears from his eyes as he followed his son's casket into the church.</p>
<p>During the service, which stretched past an hour, Rev. Vito Marziliano asked those in attendance to refrain shaking hands during the sign of peace and nod or bow instead -- a new measure that has been introduced at all Catholic churches in Toronto. The city's Catholic churches are also temporarily suspending drinking from the chalice and placing communion wafers on churchgoers' tongues to discourage the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>Evan's sudden death has put a human face on the H1N1 virus and prompted people across the country to spend hours in line for the vaccine. Clinics in Toronto opened the same day he died.</p>
<p>After the service, Mr. Frustaglio briefly addressed reporters, asking for privacy for his family. Then he, his wife and youngest son followed the hearse and a black pickup truck full of flowers away from the church in a limousine.</p>
<p>The family has established two memorial funds at Humber Valley Village School and the Hill Academy, a school for elite athletes that Evan last attended, in honour of their oldest son.</p>

<p>Re: Clinics Cancelled Next Week, Oct. 31.</p>
<p>I am concerned that the World Health Organization (WHO) and public health leaders are grossly exaggerating the risks of contracting H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Flu mainly spreads in the winter, so it is instructive to examine flu infection and death rates in South America, where winter has just passed. In Brazil, with a population of 192 million, 5,206 cases of H1N1 and 557 deaths from it were confirmed in the winter of 2009, or one death for every 345,000 people. These exceedingly low infection and death rates occurred before an H1N1 vaccine was available. To put this in perspective, regular seasonal flu kills about 64,000 people per year in the United States, or one death for every 4,800 people.</p>
<p>Thus the rate of H1N1 deaths in Brazil was 98.6% lower than the death rate from seasonal flu in the United States. This suggests we have less to fear from H1N1 flu than we do from regular seasonal flu. Yet, the WHO and public health officials proclaim that we are in the midst an H1N1 pandemic. These irrational proclamations fan the flames of mass hysteria, needlessly spooking the population and forcing governments around the world to spend billions of dollars that could be better spent elsewhere in the health-care system.</p>
<p>Instead of precipitating panic about a phantom pandemic, the WHO and public health officials should be reassuring the population that they have less to fear from H1N1 than they do from the usual seasonal flu.</p>

</div><div>Colby Cosh   </div>

<div>790 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, head of the federal Public Health Agency, admits that his department did not foresee the long lineups that beset swine-flu vaccination clinics across the country last week. As recently as Oct. 23, an Ipsos Reid poll for Canwest suggested that 48% of Canadians were either "not very likely" or "not at all likely" to seek out the jab for pandemic H1N1/09. Half the country, of course, is still more than enough to have made trouble. Statistically there is no reason to assume that any individual changed his mind about the vaccine between Oct. 23 and now. But I would bet it happened a lot -- that many of the people who told Ipsos they were too robust or too clued-in to consider vaccination were the same ones who were besieging temporary flu clinics the day the doors opened.</p>
<p>Dr. Butler-Jones has been a physician long enough to understand the shamanistic role of his profession. We're conditioned to think of "medicine" as a single, coherent planned enterprise, if not a conspiracy, and we often fear and despise it -- until we decide we need it. At which point it cannot possibly move fast enough to please us. Like the state or the church, medicine is an impersonal abstraction, but one that seems to have common priorities and intentions, significant powers and one voice. Rationalists and believers in progress invoke it; nutcases and conspiracists resist it.</p>
<p>In a way, both are paying tribute to a fiction, much like Christians and Satanists. In real life, there is no pope or president of medicine, no temple where it can be consulted, no medical mandate of heaven. The emerging vaccine debacle, though mercifully likely to have fairly limited public-health consequences, reveals the terrible truth. Like Soylent Green, medicine is made of people. Not just doctors, but administrators, industrialists, economists and politicians --none of them angels, and none with an angel's ability to predict mass behaviour, perceive and weigh risk, or foresee the judgment of future history.</p>
<p>It seems to have been the case that public health officials like Dr. Butler-Jones, in the run-up to the approval of the swine flu vaccine, feared mass skepticism more than they feared a siege by an agitated public. Their concern was not with being able to meet demand for the shot, but with lack of demand. For this, we can probably blame the Internet, though only in the sense that one would blame a cloud for raining on one's head.</p>
<p>People have always been prone to weird beliefs, but now there is a medium that compounds those beliefs, allows them to coalesce into a historical counter-narrative and unites their holders like never before. For the first time, there are people who seem not just weird, but positively, thoroughgoingly "weird-ist." Try spelunking amidst the Internet detritus of the anti-vaccine movement. There is no philosophical reason that strange beliefs about vaccination should correlate with fringe beliefs about UFOs, reptilian elites, 9/11 "truth," JFK, the world ending in 2012 you name it. Yet the correlation is real, and not hard to confirm.</p>
<p>(And have you noticed that the hard-nosed "skeptics" who scream loudest about how <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> intends to murder children with mercury and squalene in the name of profit never consider that the fellow whose electronic pamphlets and <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> videos convinced them of this great truth might be motivated by base interests of his own? It usually turns out that Dr. Unlicensed O'Diploma-Mill happens to know the cure for autism or fibromyalgia, and will be happy to sell it to you in five easy instalments.)</p>
<p>Doctors deal with the new weirdism every day. Bitter jokes about their patients' Internet reading habits have become a professional shibboleth. Dealing with anti-vaccination nonsense is especially tragic for them, since vaccination was pretty much the first really useful thing physicians could do about infectious disease. The critics always protest, of course, that they are not "anti-vaccine." They're just opposed to giving too many vaccines, or to particular components in vaccines. But doctors instinctively recognize them as epidemiological vectors of irrationalism, propagating darkly illiberal emotional archetypes; paranoid little General Rippers, meditating obsessively on the purity of their fluids.</p>
<p>And so the public health bureaucracy spent October emphasizing the contrary message: that the swine-flu vaccine was unconditionally and undeniably a good thing and that everyone, if possible, should have it. What they didn't foresee is that just about everyone would, in fact, show up all at once. Considering the circumstances, the error is understandable, perhaps forgivable.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How one Ontario community avoided chaos at H1N1 clinics; Sault Ste. Marie facility offers shining example of how primary care system delivers service</b>
</div><div>Michael Rachlis   </div>
<div>835 words</div><div>3 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Canadians are rightfully enraged at the chaos of last week's H1N1 vaccine clinics. There must be a better way to run a vaccine program. There are two main reasons why the vaccine rollout looks like rush hour at a Mexican bus terminal.</p>
<p>Late last week, vaccine manufacturer <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> notified the federal government that it would not meet its production quotas and would temporarily reduce the amount of vaccine delivered. As a result, British Columbia had no vaccine over the weekend and Alberta had no vaccine Monday.</p>
<p>However, there is a worldwide problem producing the vaccine. The horror stories in Canada are matched by those in the United States. And the federal government has already shipped 6 million doses of vaccine, which should be enough to vaccinate those at high risk - pregnant women, children 6 months to less than 5 years of age, people under 65 with chronic conditions, people who live with or care for infants under 6 months old and immuno-compromised people, and health-care workers. The real problem is delivering the vaccine to those who need it.</p>
<p>There are some communities in Canada that are delivering vaccine expeditiously to those who need it and we can learn from them.</p>
<p>For example, in Sault Ste. Marie, the Group Health Association Clinic is using its computerized appointment system to book patients for H1N1 vaccinations from throughout the Algoma Public Health Unit. Eighty per cent of "the Soo's" residents get their health care from Group Health. The appointments schedulers have access to Group Health's electronic medical record so they can ensure that the patients they book are indeed high risk. Patients arrive at the clinic and get their needle within 10 minutes. No waiting</p>
<p>Group Health has more than 60 doctors and 300 other staff and is cooperatively run by a community board and the Algoma District Medical Group. It has been a national leader in health-care innovation since it opened in 1963. The centre has had a computerized appointment system for 20 years and a comprehensive medical record since 1997. Roy Romanow referred to it as a "the jewel in the crown of medicare."</p>
<p>In other parts of Ontario, public health is now delivering the vaccine to selected family doctors' offices. Some might ask why public health didn't simply give the vaccine to family doctors in the beginning. In fact, Ontario and some other provinces have been quietly distributing the vaccine to clinics and shelters dealing with very high risk populations such the homeless, AIDS patients and drug addicts.</p>
<p>Public health authorities balked at distributing vaccine to family doctors' offices because much of it would have been squandered. Most Canadian family physicians still work in small offices with one or two doctors, a non-professionally trained receptionist and no electronic records. Many family doctors don't even have adequate refrigerators to store the vaccine. The vaccine is packaged in multiple-dose vials so public health authorities were understandably concerned that much of the precious medicine would go to waste in doctors' offices.</p>
<p>On Friday, Ontario officially announced it would distribute vaccine to family doctors who met criteria and requested it. These family practices know their high risk patients and are now inoculating them. In the midst of Toronto's chaos and confusion, one of the city's new family health teams is advertising this week's vaccination clinics for its high risk patients in its website. No fuss, no muss, no waiting.</p>
<p>That's how Canada could have rolled out the vaccine if we had a decent system of primary health care. Family doctors offices and community health centres would have vaccinated the patients they knew to be at high risk from their electronic health records. Public health then could have focused on groups like the homeless, who otherwise might not get the inoculated.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago, the father of medicare, Tommy Douglas, warned Canadians that we had only implemented the first stage of medicare: public payment for the old health system. He said the second stage of medicare would feature a new way of delivering services focused on prevention.</p>
<p>If there were a Group Health Centre in every Canadian community, the H1N1 vaccination campaign wouldn't make us look like a Third World country. We need more effective primary health care in Canada and we need to seamlessly link primary health care to public health. Let's not wait 50 years for the next pandemic to make this a reality.</p>

<p>Doctors will be allowed to bill OHIP for telephone consultations during the H1N1 pandemic as part of the province's $650 million anti-flu push, Health Minister Deb Matthews says.</p>
<p>As of last Friday, doctors are temporarily permitted to bill the Ontario Health Insurance Plan $11 for less than 10 minutes of advice or $27.85 for a longer phone consultation.</p>
<p>Matthews said the move complements Telehealth, Ontario's call-in line, now swamped with flu queries.</p>

<p>GPs receive 100,000 H1N1 vaccine</p>
<p>doses, Nov. 1</p>
<p>The news that a Toronto for-profit clinic was provided with H1N1 vaccinations for clients willing and able to pay thousands of dollars while pregnant women, young children and individuals with chronic conditions waited hours in line at public clinics reminds us of how unjust two-tier health care is. This is a reality that should have occurred to Toronto Public Health before it provided the vaccines to a private company. Canadians concluded long ago that access to quality health care should not be determined by the size of your bank account. We must continue to stand on guard for this principle - even when our own government agencies lose sight of it.</p>
