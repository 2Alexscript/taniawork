<p>WELCOME, N.C. / A crew member for Richard Childress Racing has died of complications from the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Donald "DJ" Richardson died late Friday after a lengthy hospitalization for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Richardson contracted H1N1 during a Thanksgiving visit to his home state of Massachusetts, and team officials say he had been hospitalized at Health Alliance Hospital in Leominster the entire time.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old Richardson spent last season as a tire changer on Kevin Harvick's crew.</p>

<p>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to heaven, we were all going direct the other way -- in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.</p>
<p>Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities</p>
<p>Natural disasters are down, but dizzyingly sordid sex scandals are up. Economic forecasts for Canada are cheery, if only because 12 months ago they were unspeakably grim. We have hacked and barked through two flu seasons without calamitous consequences, awaiting the H1N1 fallout of holiday hugs and hand clasps with stoicism, paper masks and antiseptic hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>As the year, and indeed, this decade we've yet to name -- the Oh-Ohs? the Noughties? the GOOgles? -- draw to a close, we look back, trying to understand the great mystery of dissolving time.</p>
<p>For any who doubts that much really changes in that fraction of a light year it takes the Earth to turn on its axis 3,638 times, be reminded that at this time 10 years ago Jean Chretien was still prime minister, George W. Bush was not yet in the White House, and people actually cared that Scary Spice was getting a divorce. There was (sort of) peace on Earth, and we waited with trepidation for the dreaded Y2K bug.</p>
<p>(In Edmonton, Bill Smith was the mayor, the Anthony Henday was still on drawing board and the Oilers were, well, you know, about the same as they are now.)</p>
<p>Small wonder that as year and decade slip away, we often ask ourselves where we've been and where we're going, what we did right or monumentally wrong and what monsters and delights might lurk around the corner.</p>
<p>And so we make lists, chiselling out a rough draft of history in bite-size portions.</p>
<p>The best of this, the worst of that.</p>
<p>The 10 best books of 2009, the 50 worst movies, lists of top newsmakers, famous people who died, rogues who stole our savings, crimes against fashion and rising indie stars in rehab.</p>
<p>Time magazine has already weighed in with its verdict, calling the first 10 years of the 21st century the "Decade from Hell," citing everything from the contested election of George W. Bush and the Sept. 11 attacks, to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Hurricane Katrina, the 2004 tsunami in South Asia and the collapse of global financial markets to illustrate its point.</p>
<p>For the media, there is, yes, a not-so-hidden agenda. End-of-year wraps fill the news hole at a time when most reporters are off somewhere tucking into their Christmas turkey or Hanukkah latkes. What better way to plug in the spaces between Boxing Day ads, dreary holiday house fires and Third World catastrophes than retrospectives on Bob Dylan's gazillionth comeback or the gizmo of the year?</p>
<p>But news outlets wouldn't devote considerable resources to playing Santa, making those lists and checking them twice, if there wasn't such an appetite for information in neat little packages tied up with bows.</p>
<p>Lists can be cheap: The 50 Worst Movies of the Year, or The Year of Dressing Ridiculously. They may be dirty -- witness the tabloid frenzy of women who slept with the Tiger. Yet in this age of information overload, they allow us to keep chaos at bay and wrap our heads around events, ideas and trends without feeling totally overwhelmed in the noisy clutter of everyday living.</p>
<p>End-of-year lists are the Coles notes of storytelling, a way to bone up, before the next act begins, on all those books we didn't have time to read and bands we didn't hear and political coups that might have passed us by.</p>
<p>For Italian novelist and deep thinker Umberto Eco, the list is much more than the sum of its shallow parts.</p>
<p>Eco is curator of a new exhibition at the Louvre in Paris devoted to the role of lists in art and literature -- from Moses's Top 10 and Homer's Iliad to a description of what's in Leopold Bloom's dresser drawer in James Joyce's Ulysses.</p>
<p>"This list doesn't destroy culture, it creates it," Eco explained in a recent interview with Der Spiegel International. "What does culture want? To make infinity comprehensible. It also wants to create order -- not always, but often. And how, as a human being, does one face infinity? How does one attempt to grasp the incomprehensible? Through lists, through catalogues, through collections in museums and through encyclopedias and dictionaries.</p>
<p>"We have always been fascinated by infinite space, by the endless stars and by galaxies upon galaxies. How does a person feel when looking at the sky? He thinks that he doesn't have enough tongues to describe what he sees. Nevertheless, people have never stopped describing the sky, simply listing what they see."</p>
<p>For Eco, there's "an irresistible magic" to lists, although he's at a loss to explain quite why they fascinate him so much. "I like lists for the same reason other people like football or pedophilia. People have their preferences."</p>
<p>So what is it that drives us to channel our inner librarian, collecting, collating and compartmentalizing?</p>
<p>On rainy summer days when I was little, we played a game called Categories. Adults and children would sit around the long wooden table at the Horner family's cottage and make charts on pieces of scrap paper. Five lines down, five lines across. Everyone took a turn coming up with a letter and a category: flowers, bodies of water, jobs. Then we'd knuckle down to see who was able to fill in all the squares within the allotted time.</p>

<p>Decades before the Internet would lure us into endless hours of addictive brain games and mindless searching, we stretched our synapses with fun, but ultimately meaningless, lists.</p>
<p>And some people just can't help themselves.</p>
<p>Back in the 1850s, an eccentric British doctor named Peter Mark Roget published his self-titled thesaurus. He'd been working on the dictionary of synonyms for the better part of 50 years, an exercise that biographer Joshua Kendall suggests helped Roget stave off the risk of madness that snaked through his family tree. Without the benefit of a modern medicine cabinet of tranquillizers, Roget poured his obsessive-compulsive tendencies -- there's speculation he probably suffered from what today would be described as a type of high-functioning autism called Asperger's syndrome -- into endless cross-referenced lists of words.</p>
<p>It's worth noting here that Roget, a man of little humour, even when experimenting with laughing gas, invented the slide rule and tried building a calculator, that rudimentary predecessor of what is today's ultimate list-maker, the computer.</p>
<p>The first decade of the new century has taken us into realms of cyberspace previously imagined only in science fiction. In this time of gadgets and widgets, we Twittered and MySpaced. We Map-Quested and Ebayed, YouTubed and iPhoned, friended and unfriended. We bragged about who had the most Apps, or kept quiet and hoped no one would guess we had no idea what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Thanks to BlackBerry and social networking, we are more connected than ever. And yet, strangely, we don't always communicate all that well, rescuing colons and parentheses from the grammatical slag-heap to add a grain of humour or sarcasm to sterile e-mail messages.</p>
<p>Most of all, we tapped into <span class="companylink">Google</span> to make customized lists, to check spellings, find news and shop. In the process, we put music shops, magazines, newspapers and telephone books on life support and reinvented the very essence of how we learn, what we read, and how long we can concentrate.</p>
<p>At times, it felt like we were competing with those computers we depend on so much to organize and process information at an alarming clip. Dashing madly in all directions, we became a society plagued by too many distractions. There's even a name for the online equivalent to attention-deficit disorder. Wilfing -- short for "what was I looking for?" -- describes the act of aimless browsing as one stream of search words begets another.</p>
<p>Umberto Eco sees in the computer, and especially the omnivorous <span class="companylink">Google</span> search engine, a place where order and anarchy converge.</p>
<p>"The minute I look at my <span class="companylink">Google</span>-generated list, it has already changed. These lists can be dangerous -- not for old people like me, who have acquired their knowledge in another way, but for young people, for whom <span class="companylink">Google</span> is a tragedy. Schools ought to teach the high art of how to be discriminating."</p>
<p>And yet it must be said that only through the extraordinary miracle of <span class="companylink">Google</span> can a journalist in Canada punch in a couple of keywords like lists and culture and in two seconds flat stumble on remarks as strikingly relevant as those of an Italian scholar interviewed by a German newsmagazine about an exhibit at a French museum.</p>
<p>"We have a limit, a very discouraging, humiliating limit: death," said Eco. "That's why we like all the things that we assume have no limits and, therefore, no end. It's a way of escaping thoughts about death. We like lists because we don't want to die."</p>
<p>Honestly, few of us are consciously thinking about anything quite as profound as death and our place in the universe when we make lists or discuss them between mouthfuls of sweet potato and Yule log.</p>
<p>But we do want to know what happened and why. Nifty news summaries, capsule reviews and those timely lists of the best, worst and indifferent help us keep up with what's going on out there in the world and feel we are a part of it.</p>
<p>It doesn't matter if you didn't see Avatar or read this year's Booker prize winner (Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall) or follow every gassy burp in the climate change talks in Copenhagen or the water meter scandal at city hall. In a pinch, <span class="companylink">Google</span> can fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>Provided you know where to start.</p>
<p>Hurt Locker. Hawaii. House foreclosures. Harry Potter. Hurricane Katrina.</p>
<p>Twilight. Tiger Woods. Terrorism. The Tipping Point. Tsunami.</p>
<p>Slumdog Millionaire. Seabiscuit. Sub-prime mortgages. Sopranos. September 11 ...</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Bites of history: Top reasons why we like lists</p>
<p>-- Peggy Curran</p>
<p>1. They make us feel smart. Or at least smarter than the people we are reading about. The Guinness Book of World Records, a bestseller for 50 years, keeps tabs on accomplishments of all shapes, sizes and levels of peculiarity. How else would you ever find out who holds the record for the fastest time running 100 metres barefoot on ice (Nico Surings, in the Netherlands, December 2006), the most cockroaches eaten in one sitting (Ken Edwards, 36 cockroaches, in England, 2001), or the heaviest weight dangled from a swallowed sword (Thomas Blackthorne, 25 kg, in Italy, April 2009)?</p>
<p>2. They make us feel smug. Didn't make the list again this year? Obviously, you aren't David Letterman, Tiger Woods, Earl Jones, Octomom, Jon and Kate Gosselin, Chris Brown, Rihanna, Jessica Simpson, Mel Gibson or Bernard Madoff.</p>
<p>3. They tell us what to read, see, do. Or really avoid. Without those timely end-of-year lists, would you know what CD your mother will want this Christmas (Susan Boyle, Michael Buble) and what movie you absolutely must/under no circumstances see ( Avatar/The Lovely Bones)?</p>
<p>4. They tell us where to go. Even if you never seem to get farther than the AMT station or the Champlain Bridge, there's something invigorating about the endless possibilities in books like 1,000 Places to See Before You Die, which dazzles with the magic of Turkey's whirling dervishes, Count Dracula's castle in Romania and sunset on Australia's Ayers Rock. On the other hand, <span class="companylink">Mercer International</span> lists Baghdad, Kinshasa, Port au Prince and Khartoum among the least livable of world cities again this year.</p>
<p>5. They teach us the error of our ways. Fortynine years have gone by since the late Richard Blackwell began tabulating the best and worst of fashion and design. What have we learned from Cher's golden beads, Celine's backward tuxedo and Bjork's feather duster? Not much, according to a coven of fashion mavens, who cite such style faux pas of our times as Uggs, Crocs, harem pants and very short shorts paired with tights.</p>

<p>Friends, there are year-end reviews -- and there is Telescope's year-end review. The year just concluding has been rich in its bounty of the odd, the obtuse and the obscure. Take for instance, these nuggets:</p>
<p>- - A bacon sandwich is the ideal cure for a hangover. The bread is high in carbohydrates and the bacon is full of proteins that break down into amino acids, something your body needs to develop a clearer head. Plus, you know, it's bacon.</p>
<p>- - By the way, say researchers, women's underarms typically smell like onions and men's like Gouda cheese. That has to be bad news for the purveyors of Gouda cheese.</p>
<p>- - Then there was the trouble in Australia on International Whores Day when prostitutes marched in protest against the high rates that local newspapers charge for escort ads. "I'm paying too much," said one sex worker, "for a measly two inches."</p>
<p>Friends, there is plenty more where that came from. Read on for Telescope's Best of 2009:</p>
<p>January</p>
<p>A survey in Britain has revealed the most irritating invention in recent memory is the karaoke machine. Cellphones, alarm clocks and 24-hour sports channels also scored high.</p>
<p>Speaking of being irritated, a four-year-old boy in Columbus, Ohio became so upset when his teenage babysitter accidentally stepped on his foot that he went over to the closet, pulled out a gun, loaded it, then shot the babysitter. The teen survived.</p>
<p>In terms of popularity, the fastest growing name given to newborns in the U.S. is Nevaeh. That's "heaven" spelled backward.</p>
<p>In Beverly Hills, Calif., a liposuction doctor admitted to using the excessive body fat extracted from his patients to create a bio-diesel fuel to power his Ford SUV.</p>
<p>Officials in Berlin, responding to a noise complaint, found a 60-year-old man living in his apartment with 1,700 parakeets. The man said he had adopted two birds because he felt lonely, and that nature sort of took it from there.</p>
<p>By the way, one of the organizations to cancel its meeting when an ice storm was forecast but had yet to hit was the St. David Optimists Club of Fulton County, Illinois.</p>
<p>February</p>
<p>The "eternal" flame at a veterans' memorial in Bullhead City, Ariz., was turned off after only one month. The $1,200 Cdn monthly gas bill to commemorate the veterans' sacrifice was deemed too high for the city to bear.TVviewers in Tuscon, Ariz.,</p>
<p>were cheated from watching their Cardinals lose the Super Bowl in the final 30 seconds of the game. The broadcast was interrupted by a clip from a porn movie. Fans were watching the Steelers drive the ball downfield for the winning touchdown when, suddenly, there was a woman on the screen unzipping a man's pants and, um, engaging in sportsmanlike conduct.</p>
<p>A student in San Diego announced she was auctioning her virginity to pay for her education. Natalie Dylan needed the money to fund her master's degree in Family and Marriage Therapy. An estimated 10,000 men poneyed up bids for her virtue that topped out at more than $4.4 million Cdn.</p>
<p>Valentine's Day shoppers in Eau Claire, Wis., were getting more bang for their buck: Buy a pair of earrings, get a free gun. They called it the "Bang Bling Deal."</p>
<p>Then there was this headline in the New York Post: "Peter Pan Actress: Hook is All Hands!"</p>
<p>March</p>
<p>Officials at the famed Globe Theatre in London agreed with a request to meet with police to discuss mounting concerns that two Shakespearean plays performed at the theatre -- Romeo and Juliet and Julius Caesar -- promote knife crimes.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, police in Silver Spring, Md., arrested 16 people after a brawl broke out at a Stop the Violence concert.</p>
<p>Then there was the guy in Austria who started knocking off banks to get the money to pay for his fiancee's expectations for a lavish wedding. "The money from the first robbery went in one day, so I just kept going," the 36-year-old bridegroom told the judge at his trial.</p>
<p>An unnamed Illinois newspaper reported in the first paragraph of a news story that, "About 140 employees will be laid off at <span class="companylink">Caterpillar Inc</span>." -- only, um, the word "off" was left out.</p>
<p>Then there was the headline in the Arizona Republic: "Dog Eats $400, But Woman Recovers Some Cash Later"</p>
<p>April</p>
<p>The Essex parish council in England decided to leave its crop of potholes intact as "the original traffic-calming measure."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a guy in Moscow, Alexei Roskov, was so despairing for his life that he downed three bottles of vodka, then threw himself out of the fifth-floor window of his apartment. Somehow he survived the fall with barely a scratch. Yet when Roskov staggered back upstairs to his apartment, his wife started in on him, so he jumped again. That leap didn't kill him either.</p>
<p>Civic officials in Webster, Mass., were all embarrassed. For years, they'd been calling the local watering hole Lake Chargoggagoggmanchaoggagoggchaubunaguhgamaugg.</p>
<p>Well, they were wrong. It's actually Lake Chargoggagoggmanchauggagoggchaubunagungamaugg.</p>
<p>A British supermarket chain renamed its stock of pollock fish because shoppers were too embarrassed to ask for it by name. Sainsbury's will now sell pollock as "colin." Pollock to the English ear sounds like a slang word for testicles.</p>
<p>May</p>
<p>A teenage boy in Findlay, Ohio, was banned from his Baptist high school graduation because he attended his girlfriend's prom and admitted to, um, dancing with her. "Should a Christian place himself at an event where young ladies will have low-cut dresses and be dancing in them?" asked the school's principal. The boy decided the answer was definitely yes.</p>
<p>In West Haven, Utah, the principal of a junior high school was told to apologize to a student he sent home for wearing a kilt. The principal told the boy the kilt could be construed as cross-dressing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, two workers at Yellowstone National Park were fired after they were caught peeing into the Old Faithful geyser.</p>
<p>Then there was this health alert from the Weekly World News: "The swine flu epidemic has reached the United States. This new mutated strand of influenza starts as a normal flu, then turns people into pigs. ... The new swine flu can be spread by coughing, sneezing, or being bit by another werepig."</p>
<p>June</p>
<p>In New York City, the appropriately named Lucky the cat slipped from his owner's apartment window and fell 26 storeys to the street below. There he made a graceful and typically feline landing, with nary a scratch. Evidently, Lucky achieved "terminal velocity," the speed at which the body relaxes and allows for a softer landing.</p>
<p>A travel agency in Harbin, China, was finding success offering tours for couples that are on the verge of divorcing. The advertising pitch? "If it's destiny for us to break up, then let's have more romantic memories than painful ones."</p>
<p>And providing proof that perspective is a terrible thing to lose is this headline from the Bloomington-Normal Daily Pantagraph: "Deputy Tasers 72-Year-Old Woman During Traffic Stop"</p>
<p>July</p>
<p>In one office in England, the Casual Friday custom of wearing jeans to work was replaced with something a little more radical: call it Naked Friday. The team-building strategy struck a responsive chord with the firm's workers. Said Samantha Jackson, the company's manager: "Now that we've seen each other naked, there are no barriers."</p>
<p>An Olympic athlete from New Zealand opened his own brothel to raise the money he needs to compete in the 2012 London Olympics. It cost Logan Campbell close to $110,000 Cdn to represent his country at the Beijing Olympics, thus the idea of the brothel. Licensed prostitution is legal in New Zealand and Campbell hopes to raise about $200,000 in the next two years.</p>
<p>The teaching staff at Southway Junior School in West Sussex, England, wanted to spark the flame of creativity in their students, so they staged the crash of a fake UFO near the school, then encouraged the kids to write about it. However, many of the kids were so traumatized, they went home crying and wondering if the world as they knew it was about to end. Parents were not amused.</p>
<p>August</p>
<p>A male tortoise in England finally won his mate, 15 long years after she first began to spurn his advances. The problem might have been their age difference. Billy is 110 years old and Tammy is only 47. Yet the happy couple became proud parents of seven eggs. Said the tortoises' owner, Peter Crane: "I didn't realize Billy had it in him."</p>
<p>A 25-year-old tow-truck driver in Buffalo was texting on one cellphone and talking on another when he slammed into a car and drove into a swimming pool.</p>
<p>Meanwhile in Melbourne, Australia, thieves stole 58 curling rocks that were being stored in a refrigerated truck outside a downtown ice rink. Their haul represents one-third of all the curling rocks to be found in Australia. Police suspect the burglars were looking for beer.</p>
<p>Then there is the theme park in Britain that banned roller-coaster fans from raising their arms during the ride. Why? Complaints of body odour. Surmised Thorpe Park director Mike Vallis of the unpleasant aromas on hot days: "It can get really pongy."</p>
<p>We can't overlook this headline from ananova.com:"Family Harassed By Vengeful Weasel"</p>
<p>September</p>
<p>Police in Britain found a pretty good lead on solving a break-in at a school in Gateshead. The burglar left his dog behind. Police found the Jack Russell at the school after responding to a burglar alarm.</p>
<p>A <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> branch in Tampa, Fla., refused to cash a cheque for a customer with no arms because -- and we are not making this up -- he couldn't provide a thumbprint.</p>
<p>In Vienna, Austria, a faithful Catholic named Gunther Link believed his prayers had been answered when he was rescued from a stuck elevator. Filled with gratitude, he immediately went to church to offer his thanks to God. It was there he was later found, dead, crushed under the 860-pound weight of a stone altar that had fallen on him. Said a spokescop: "He seems to have embraced a pillar on which the stone altar was perched and it fell on him, killing him instantly."</p>
<p>October</p>
<p>The University of Florida has abandoned the emergency response plan it developed in the event the campus is attacked by zombies. A university spokesflak said, "It didn't really belong." The school's other plans for dealing with hurricanes and pandemics will remain.</p>
<p>In the North Carolina burg of Canton, a Baptist preacher announced plans to burn Bibles and books by Christian authors. Pastor Marc Grizzard said the King James Version of the Bible is the only one his followers, um, follow. All other versions, including the Living Bible, are "satanic." Also on the torch list are books by evangelist Billy Graham.</p>
<p>While we're in the Southern U.S., police in Little Rock say a mugger dropped his own wallet during a robbery, then phoned his victim to ask for it back. An arrest quickly followed.</p>
<p>Then there is the fellow in Duluth, Minn., who was convicted for driving drunk. That might not seem all that unusual but the guy was, um, piloting his <span class="companylink">La-Z-Boy</span> chair at the time. The chair was powered by a converted lawn mower engine and featured a stereo and cupholders.</p>
<p>November</p>
<p>Police in Azamgarh, India, admitted they put the remains of a 22-year-old man in a body bag and left it on the roof of their police station -- for two years. The corpse was supposed to be sent away for DNA testing, but was put on the roof instead when local officials declined to pay for the tests. Then everybody forgot about it. The body, which was really nothing more than a collection of bones after two years, was returned to the family.</p>
<p>Police in Carroll, Iowa, picked up two burglary suspects who were still wearing their "masks" -- and that's a liberal interpretation of the word "mask." What these two guys did was to scribble on their bare faces with one of those permanent black markers.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a baffled bank teller in Poland refused to hand over any cash to the robber who was threatening her -- with a spoon. The crook burst into the bank branch in Lublin brandishing the utensil and shouting, "This is a stickup." Much mirth and merriment ensued.</p>
<p>Tasha Johnson and Markeith Brown's wedding day in Tampa, Fla., was turning out beautifully until a full-scale brawl broke out. Before anyone knew for sure what was happening, one of the guests had the groom's 74-year-old grandma in a headlock. She was unhurt.</p>
<p>Then there was the headline in the Arizona Republic that suggested that maybe your average Godzilla movie is not so far-fetched: "Japanese Fishing Boat Capsized By Giant Jellyfish"</p>
<p>December</p>
<p>Remember that Walking With Dinosaurs show that played in Edmonton the past two summers? It was the one with the giant animatronic reptiles of old. Well, one of those dinosaurs went missing in Guadalajara, Mexico. Since the show's people don't believe it just walked off on its own, foul play is suspected. The missing dinosaur stands around five feet tall and answers to the name "Larry." Well, we made up the Larry part.</p>
<p>Getting into the White House isn't as tough as the secret service makes it out to be. Take the family in the camper van who were waved in because they honked their horn as they approached the gates.</p>
<p>And finally ...</p>
<p>British researchers say the most stressful time of the work week is Tuesday at 11:45 a.m. Keep your head down.</p>

<p>Who knew there was room for anger in the kingdom of Internet fads ruled by LOLCats?</p>
<p>"FML," digital slang used to express frustration, ranked second among <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s Top 15 words and phrases used in American status updates in 2009.</p>
<p>The acronym, which stands for "f-- my life," came blazing onto the <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> lexicon scene, moving from a relatively low usage rate to one of the most mainstream status updates in 2009, according to the social networking site's data team.</p>
<p>The month of May -- a time when many students are wrapping up their final exams and hunting for summer jobs -- saw the biggest spike in statuses containing the acronym.</p>
<p>After a relative lull in usage during the summer, FML crept back toward chart-topping levels throughout the first semester of a new school year.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Facebook</span>'s data team also noticed a weekly trend in the number of frustrated status updates. "As we'd expect ... Mondays and Tuesdays are particularly rough," the data team said in a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> note.</p>
<p>"Surprisingly, it is not Mondays that rate highest, but Tuesdays."</p>
<p>In order to make the list more comprehensive, the data team used keywords to group similar items. Keywords "Michael Jackson," "Patrick Swayze" and "Billy Mays" were used to map the frequency for status updates mentioning celebrity deaths (fourth place).</p>
<p>Movie titles, such as New Moon, Transformers and The Hangover were used to track discussion of movies (sixth place).</p>
<p>Status updates featuring <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> applications topped the list, while swine flu (third), family (fifth), sports (seventh), health care (eighth) and FB (ninth) all cracked the Top 10.</p>
<p>Twitter came in a respectable 10th place, even though activity peaked in April and has been decreasing steadily ever since.</p>

<p>Hundreds of thousands of Shiite pilgrims descended on Iraq's holy shrine city of Karbala yesterday for the climax of Ashura commemorations, despite fears of violent attacks by Sunni extremists.</p>
<p>As they poured into Karbala, violence across Iraq claimed the lives of seven people, including two worshippers killed when a bomb struck an Ashura procession in eastern Baghdad.</p>
<p>Security forces have beefed up their presence in Karbala and authorities are also checking on about 60,000 foreign worshippers expected to attend the ceremonies to ensure they do not have swine flu.</p>
<p>Black flags, representing the sadness of Shiites during Ashura, were seen all over the central Iraqi city, south of Baghdad, along with pictures of Imam Hussein and Imam Abbas, who are both buried here.</p>
<p>The 10-day Ashura rituals which end today commemorate the killing of Imam Hussein, a grandson of the prophet Mohammed, by armies of the Sunni caliph Yazid in 680.</p>
<p>The Karbala police chief said that about 25,000 officers and soldiers had been deployed to secure the commemoration ceremonies. Helicopters are providing extra surveillance and bomb-sniffing dogs are being used at checkpoints.</p>
<p>To counter female suicide attackers who have struck Karbala before, police have deployed 600 female personnel on three roads into the city. Cameras are also monitoring pilgrims' movements across Karbala.</p>
<p>During Ashura in March 2004, near-simultaneous bombings at a Shiite mosque in Baghdad and in Karbala killed more than 170 people.</p>

<p>A crew member for Richard Childress Racing has died of complications from the H1N1 virus. Donald "DJ" Richardson died late Friday after a lengthy hospitalization for acute respiratory distress syndrome. Richardson contracted H1N1 during a Thanksgiving visit to his home state of Massachusetts, and team officials say he had been hospitalized ever since.</p>
<p>The 37-year-old Richardson spent last season on Kevin Harvick's crew. He began his NASCAR Sprint Cup Series career with Andy Petree Racing in 1999 and had previously worked for Penske Racing, Hendrick Motorsports and Braun Racing.</p>

<p>Dr. Rob Fowler does not know how long a person with severe H1N1 disease can remain on a ventilator and still be discharged from intensive care alive.</p>
<p>If there is a limit, he has not seen it yet.</p>
<p>There are H1N1 patients in Canada who have been on ventilators since September.</p>
<p>Some of the sickest patients, their lungs so inflamed and fluid-filled, have had to be turned onto their stomachs and ventilated, face down, to keep secretions and bacteria from pooling in the back of their lungs.</p>
<p>Immobilized by drugs, their muscles are wasting. They need high doses of sedatives and paralyzing agents that stop their nerves from sending any signals to the muscles, to keep them from fighting against the ventilator. Like astronauts on long space flights, "their muscles are completely de-conditioned," says Fowler, assistant professor in the departments of medicine and critical care medicine at the University of Toronto. "Most of the time, at the end of this, they often can't hold something in their hand, let alone stand up. That's only something that will come back after many, many months of rehabilitation."</p>
<p>Fowler, a soft-spoken critical care doctor and researcher who has helped inform colleagues the world over how to care for patients with severe H1N1 disease, is aware of patients who have been living in this state of almost suspended animation for months.</p>
<p>He is still hoping they will recover.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Seventy per cent of the population infected. Thirty-three per cent seriously ill. Up to 58,000 Canadians dead. Soon after the first hints of a worldwide infectious disease outbreak emerged in March, when a baffling respiratory infection struck residents of the small Mexican village of La Gloria, Canadian public health officials braced for what they had been planning for for years: a grave viral attack.</p>
<p>History holds that pandemics occur three or four times each century, and it had been unnervingly long since the last outbreak, in 1968. The world could only guess at the next danger that might come to pass, and for five years everyone had been watching a different kind of virus -- H5N1, or "bird flu," a pathogen that kills birds like a shot, and is fatal in up to 60 per cent of the humans it infects.</p>
<p>The new illness -- called H1N1 -- came from pigs, not birds, but as human infections with a "novel" flu strain of swine origin were identified in Mexico, then in Southern California and Texas, and then Canada, the World Health Organization quickly warned governments to prepare for a "public health emergency of international concern."</p>
<p>Eight months out, H1N1 has killed at least 10,582 people worldwide, 397 of them in Canada, all of the deaths heartbreaking, and some of them shocking: 10-year-old Vanetia Warner, a figure skater and Grade 5 student from Cornwall, Ont., who so loved Miley Cyrus that a continuous loop of the pop star's music played during the little girl's wake; Evan Frustaglio, a 13-year-old Mississauga North Stars hockey player who collapsed after a bath, his warm body limp and lifeless in his father's arms; 23-year-old Fatiha Idrissi Kaitouni of Montreal, who spent two months in a medically induced coma after her son was delivered by caesarean section, waking only once, according to reports, to ask for her baby.</p>
<p>But the surge in deaths the pandemic plans predicted hasn't happened. So far, H1N1 may be on track to kill fewer people than regular seasonal flu. Some of the most-feared scenarios have not materialized. Intensive care units have been strained, but not crippled. Doctors have not had to decide which patients were "salvageable" and which would get the last available ventilators. After weeks of near-panic and confusion, the mass vaccination clinics have closed, the number of people getting sick is falling, and public interest and concern appears to have all but evaporated.</p>
<p>The first global influenza pandemic of the century appears to be going out with a whisper, and not a bang.</p>
<p>"The virus writes the rules," World Health Organization director-general Margaret Chan said on June 11 when she raised the global pandemic alert from Phase 5 to 6, the highest, and H1N1 has not attacked as ferociously as feared. Most importantly, the people most likely to die from human swine flu if infected -- older people -- are the ones least likely to get H1N1, because of past exposure to similar variants that circulated in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Without that existing immunity, H1N1's death toll would be higher by tenfold. Essentially, life had already vaccinated the most vulnerable against the pandemic virus.</p>
<p>The illness is mild in most, and in the small number who have become seriously sick, intensive, aggressive care and dramatic "lung rescue" therapies have made it possible to save people who otherwise would have died.</p>
<p>The H1N1 narrative is still being written but, to this point, in Canada and other developed countries it's a story of unprecedented global scientific collaboration and almost-real-time information-sharing. Never before has a pandemic been detected so quickly, or tracked more closely. The fears about health care workers not showing up for work were unfounded. The public health system mobilized to deliver the largest vaccination program in the nation's history.</p>
<p>But it's also a story about transparency, or lack thereof. The public wasn't aware of how decisions were being made, or who was making them.</p>
<p>"There was lots of confusion about who got what, when, who was eligible for the vaccine, and it was changing on a daily basis," says Dr. Ross Upshur, director for the Joint Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto. "As a clinician, when you have a family and only one of them is on a priority list, it's very hard to say, 'You get the vaccine and the rest of you don't,' because it makes no sense. Infections spread in families."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The main road map for the response was a federal pandemic plan built on assumptions: that the next pandemic would first emerge most likely in Asia, giving Canada time to prepare; that between 34,000 and 138,000 people would be hospitalized but recover, and that 11,000 and 58,000 would die.</p>
<p>But H1N1 didn't follow the script.</p>
<p>Mexico, not Asia, recorded the first known death from H1N1, on April 12.</p>
<p>Fourteen days later, Canadian public health officials announced the virus was in Canada.</p>
<p>Soon, Canadian researchers discovered the virus was behaving in startling ways. It was preferentially attacking the young and generally healthy -- a group flu normally spares -- and causing catastrophically low levels of oxygen in the blood, serious lung damage and multi-organ failure.</p>
<p>"Yes, mortality has been less than expected, but look at who's dying," Upshur says. "Younger people who had a probability of death that was as low as can be. And all of these were preventable deaths. Yes, I'm glad there weren't tens of thousands of deaths -- who would wish that? But the deaths that did occur were disproportionately in younger people, who you would not have expected to die."</p>
<p>This was an eerie flashback to SARS. For health care workers who experienced that outbreak, H1N1 at first stirred memories of healthy, relatively young people in acute respiratory distress.</p>
<p>"It's easy to say that people who work in intensive care units see very severely ill, relatively young people all the time," says Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital and a SARS survivor.</p>
<p>"But to see them in an outbreak, in a setting of respiratory disease, just looks more like SARS. I think pandemic stress, the stress of young people with very severe illness, pregnant women at risk of dying themselves and losing their babies, those are not circumstances you see very often in ICUs. So it's stressful anyway. But when it's layered on top of people's experience with the SARS epidemic, it makes it harder to care of those patients and deal with those circumstances."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>SARS was what some doctors initially feared when the Mexicans began dying.</p>
<p>Earl Brown was in his Ottawa lab in early April when reports of an outbreak in Mexico of a strange respiratory infection were posted to ProMED, an online global electronic reporting system for infectious disease outbreaks.</p>
<p>"Mexico started to get alarmed when they started getting some severe pneumonias, and they started to get quite a few. They couldn't identify the virus. In some of the people, their lungs looked like people who had SARS," says Brown, a University of Ottawa virologist. "That got people nervous. 'How big is the outbreak in Mexico?' "</p>
<p>Then, on April 17, American health officials reported that two children in California had been infected with an influenza strain rarely seen in humans -- a flu of pig origin.</p>
<p>"That was sort of weird, but you know that periodically farmers have been infected with viruses from their pigs and they don't get too sick," Brown says.</p>
<p>"So there were these two kids in California, and there were these little niggles of reports of some respiratory virus going on in Mexico. But the two hadn't been put together."</p>
<p>In Mexico, virtually all the tests they were using were coming back negative for every prototype strain of flu known. "That raised the question: either it's a new flu virus, or it's something else," says Dr. Tim Booth, director of viral diseases at the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Lab in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Scientists get very worried if there's any kind of flu they cannot type.</p>
<p>Dr. Frank Plummer, director of the Winnipeg lab, was at home watching a hockey game when he received an e-mail from the head of Mexico's national microbiology lab, asking Plummer's help testing specimens from Mexico.</p>
<p>On April 22, 51 samples arrived from Mexico. The Winnipeg researchers were nervous.</p>
<p>"We don't know what we are dealing with. Is it another SARS or another new, emerging respiratory illness? We don't know," recalls Dr. Yan Li, chief of the lab's respiratory viruses section.</p>
<p>By 10 p.m. that night, 18 of the samples had tested positive for influenza A, but investigators still didn't know what subtype. They worked through the night, and by 3 a.m. the next morning, the picture was clear: the Mexican virus was the same H1N1 "swine flu" virus as had struck in California.</p>
<p>Canada was the first to announce the link.</p>
<p>It would also be the next country hit.</p>
<p>First of a two-part series</p>

Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg on Dec. 18. Dr. Li led a team

develop a test that allowed public health labs across the province
to determine rapidly whether a specimen was positive for H1N1.   </p>

</p>
<p>The decade is almost over and we still haven't decided what to call it.</p>
<p>Is it the zeros, or the 00s? Many suggest the "ohs!," or the "oh-ohs," or the "uh-ohs." In England, they're calling them the "oughties" and the "naughties."</p>
<p>Allow me to toss a suggestion into the ring for a name that symbolizes the past decade perfectly. How about the "zips" - and not just because zip stands for zero? It's also because we've zipped through the fastest-moving decade in human history - 10 years that seemed to whiz by in a few gazillion nano-seconds.</p>
<p>Much of this is because of the information revolution that's left us all breathless as we bark into our cellphones while firing off 17 emails while surfing the Web 24/7 while shouting at our kids to "get off the computer now!"</p>
<p>The world has transformed so crazily, we actually have to pass laws forbidding people from driving a car while typing text messages on their cellphones while eating take-out noodles with chopsticks.</p>
<p>Constant change is now the only constant.</p>
<p>During the Y2K crisis, we worried the Millennium Bug would shut down our Stone Age computers that hissed and gurgled like a kettle for 45 seconds each time we pressed a key. Back then, there was slow speed or no speed. Now, Videotron informs me my extraordinarily fast high-speed Internet is totally outdated because they're offering new "extreme high-speed" and "extreme high-speed-plus" and even "ultimate speed."</p>
<p>Soon these, too, will be outpaced by "extra-apocalyptic, utmost-transcendental, unsurpassable super-sublime speed."</p>
<p>Everything over 10 years old is now under threat, from car companies to TV networks and newspapers. Everything new is already being reinvented.</p>
<p>In 2000, there was no such thing as Wikipedia, just a quaint thing called an encyclopedia.</p>
<p>There were no iPods, no <span class="companylink">YouTube</span>, no <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, no GPS and no wi-fi - while a BlackBerry was an ingredient in a fruit salad.</p>
<p>A decade ago, only 10 per cent of people owned a cellphone and I was not one of them. Now, 60 per cent of the world owns one, and it's rising to 61 per cent while you read this.</p>
<p>There also are 3.2 billion email accounts - and all of them are getting junk mail from former Nigerian princes.</p>
<p>The earth has been literally wired and now it's set to go wireless, creating a brave new world where our children may be free at last to sit at their desk without a tangle of wires by their feet.</p>
<p>Yet it's not just technological life that's moving at zip speed. It's our political and emotional lives, too, as we careen from one panicky global crisis to another.</p>
<p>In the last year alone, we have lived through a Great Depression and a Great Recovery - and we all know that everything could crash again next week, then recover, then crash, then ...</p>
<p>This year, we also survived a Swine Flu panic-demic that never really arrived, while earlier in the decade we lived through Y2K, 9/11, the dot.com bubble, the Enron collapse, the GM near-bankruptcy, the Asian tsunami, Hurricane Katrina, the Iraq-Afghanistan wars and the shameless demoting of Pluto from planet to space lump.</p>
<p>Life is a roller-coaster where one crisis constantly eclipses the last - and what ever happened to the hole in the ozone layer?</p>
<p>Now we face panic over global warming Armageddon, if the 2012 Mayan doomsday prediction doesn't get us first.</p>
<p>And if you're still not worried, astronomers have just discovered that the Milky Way is spinning 161,000 kilometres an hour faster than they thought - so even the universe is speeding up this decade.</p>
<p>This increases the chance of a collision between our galaxy and another galaxy, say scientists - and where do you think that will leave you in the year 200,010, buddy?</p>
<p>The pace of life is transforming so quickly we need new humans to cope with it - and brain scientists say we may get them.</p>
<p>During periods of rapid change, the human brain can apparently evolve quickly in only generations. Our era may be one of them as our brains strain to become a new Homo Googlensis.</p>
<p>For now, we still haven't reached our speed limit. As the "zips" decade ends and a new one begins, I suspect life will move from extremely high-speed to unbearably high-speed. By the time this century enters its mid-teen years, I think the "slow movement" will be speeding up, urging us to return to a more gentle and bucolic era - like a decade ago.</p>
<p>By 2020, there will be a planet-wide trend to slow down for at least a decade. Then get ready for the snoring 20s.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a happy and slow-speed holiday to all.</p>

</p>
<p>What? Huh? December again already? Time to take stock and sum up, you say? Well, somebody's got to do it, so I sat down with the tools of my trade.</p>
<p>While cutting the lime into wedges, I gave 2009 the mental once-over: Recession. Afghanistan. Swine flu. Bernie Madoff. The Canadiens looking (and playing) like the Lollipop Guild. The Michael Jackson industry. Iran. The climate change issue. Earl Jones. Olympic marketing overkill. The coalition government fuss. The New York Yankees winning the World Series. Michael Ignatieff. City hall scandals. Tiger Woods. Ugh.</p>
<p>I poured another shot and tried to think of good things about '09, but stalled after the Alouettes and Olivia Wilde.</p>
<p>All those various bad things were just too dreary for me to fool with. I need something to mock, not mourn over.</p>
<p>Fortunately more tequila always brings more inspiration, so I persevered. Hmmm. "The year of '25 random things about ...' "? Nahh, that fad died as quickly as it arose. Twitter? That, too, now seems to be fading fast. Maybe "climategate" (because I kind of suspect this is both imminent disaster and a vast conspiracy). But everybody gets so mad about it. Nope.</p>
<p>I considered "infandous," an archaic word some over-educated pompousoid in a cabinet minister's office used about British loudmouth MP George Galloway. It means "beneath contempt" and "beneath notice" and clearly suits '09 perfectly. But I couldn't decide if 2009 would have to be the year of infandousness or the year of infandocity. I thought about the Beatles - over-marketed, half of them dead and half of them wrinkly, but apparently as eternal as ... bingo! There it was. And here it is:</p>
<p>2009 is surely the Year of the Vampire.</p>
<p>The lifeless undead were ubiquitous this year, first in teen fiction, then in teen movies, teen TV, everywhere. True Blood, Twilight, The Vampire Diaries, etc., etc.</p>
<p>It wasn't all utterly witless. There was an indie movie (with Devon Aoki!) called Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Undead, a Tom Stoppard reference which will not be lost upon the well-read.</p>
<p>But most of it is, shall we say, popular culture. I get 14 million <span class="companylink">Google</span> hits on "vampire," but under 4 million on "Stephen Harper," who come to think of it, is in many ways ... but let's not go there.</p>
<p>Why are we obsessed with vampires? Sociologists droned on about anxiety in the culture. Novelist Anne Rice calls vampirism (vampirity?) "a powerful metaphor for the outcast and monster in all of us."</p>
<p>Nuts. I just think vampires have a lot in common with the personality of this whole year: cheerless, scary, narcissistic, parasitic, greedy, ominous, menacing but ridiculous, pale but bloodsoaked, immortal and immoral, horny and sexy (or so I am told by women who should know better).</p>
<p>And let's face it, their non-lives are better than our real ones: They never age, they have lots of money, they don't have to get up early, they don't fret over calories or exercise, many of them have glamorous accents, few have actual jobs ... being a vampire would be even better than being a rock star!</p>
<p>And, you know, every society needs role models. Vampires are undeniably the meta-phenomenon, the archetype, of 2009.</p>
<p>Vampires were not, however, the only absurd thing about '09. Here are some of my other favourites:</p>
<p>Those wacky Belgians: Belgium's national body-building championships were cancelled after government anti-doping inspectors showed up - and all 20 competitors ran away.</p>
<p>They should have expected some testing: last year three-quarters of competitors tested positive for steroids and other bad stuff.</p>
<p>Annals of nursing: In 2008, the Connecticut Nursing Association held a banquet to honour Betty Lichtenstein as "nurse of the year." This year she was arrested and charged with pretending to be a nurse.</p>
<p>It turns out, cops said, that there is no Connecticut Nursing Association. She had spent $2,000 to put on the dinner for herself. She could end up volunteering in a prison infirmary for five years, on charges of reckless endangerment and criminal impersonation.</p>
<p>Pickup line of the year: "I love you - and I have a condom!" Yeah, that oughtta work. (It's the first line of a justly forgotten movie called The Uninvited.)</p>
<p>National unity explained: Conservative minister John Baird, cranky because Toronto city hall missed a deadline for some stimulus money and was blaming him, was overheard suggesting angrily that Toronto should just "(bad word) off!"</p>
<p>Conservative popularity dropped in Toronto - but took off like a rocket in every other part of the country.</p>
<p>Tweet of the year: Singer Lily Allen: "People say I'm egocentric. But enough about them."</p>
<p>Toughest review of the year: Deborah Ross in The Spectator mag: "There really isn't a lot to say about Lesbian Vampire Killers apart from this: don't go anywhere near it. Just don't see it. Do something else instead. Do anything else instead. Catch up with your ironing ... at 87 minutes, it's probably a good 87 minutes too long."</p>
<p>Annals of education: Actual employment ad from the School of Sociology and Social Policy of the University of Leeds, in England:</p>
<p>"Research Officer - The rise and regulation of lap dancing and the place of sexual labour and consumption in the night time economy."</p>
<p>The fine print says the job - salary £31,513, or about $54,500 - involves interviewing 300 lap dancers.</p>
<p>Like a complete unknown: In Long Branch, N.J., cops got a complaint about an "eccentric old man acting suspiciously" and sent a squad car. A 22-year-old officer found a guy who wasn't a local. He gave his name but it meant nothing to the cop or her partner, he had no ID, and he seemed pretty scruffy, so they put him in the back of the car. When they radioed their sergeant, he seemed a little surprised that they had rousted Bob Dylan.</p>
<p>Not that there's anything wrong with that: This May headline from CNN's website revealed a previously unknown side of the Dear Leader: "Gay soldier appeals to Obama."</p>
<p>Correction of the year: <span class="companylink">N.Y. Times</span> TV critic Alessandra Stanley wrote an obituary appraisal of Walter Cronkite. Then came the correction, noting that Stanley had "misstated the date that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was killed and referred incorrectly to Mr. Cronkite's coverage of D-Day. Dr. King was killed on April 4, 1968, not April 30. Mr. Cronkite covered the D-Day landing from a warplane; he did not storm the beaches. In addition, Neil Armstrong set foot on the moon on July 20, 1969, not July 26. The CBS Evening News overtook The Huntley-Brinkley Report on NBC in the ratings during the 1967-68 television season, not after Chet Huntley retired in 1970. A communications satellite used to relay correspondents' reports from around the world was Telstar, not Telestar. Howard K. Smith was not one of the CBS correspondents Mr. Cronkite would turn to for reports from the field after he became anchor of The CBS Evening News in 1962; he left CBS before Mr. Cronkite was the anchor."</p>
<p>What will they call their kids?: Kelly Hildebrandt of Florida married Kelly Hildebrandt of Texas. The first one's middle name is Katrina; the second one's middle is Carl. They met online, after she was searching for her own name on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>. After making sure they aren't closely related, they started dating.</p>
<p>What could possibly go wrong?: Solange Magnano, Miss Argentina of 1994, died from complications after buttock-enhancement therapy. She was 38.</p>
<p>Annals of banking: Every year there are stupid bank mistakes, but this year's was a doozy. Josh Muszynski of Manchester, N.H., swiped his debit card at a gas station to buy cigarettes. His bank account was billed $23 quadrillion. Then the bank added a $15 overdraft fee.</p>
<p>Annals of tourism: The people of Appenzell Inner Rhodes, an area mountainous even by Swiss standards, voted to ban naked hiking after an infestation by German nudists. Actually they wore socks and boots, but that was all; not always a pretty sight, I understand.</p>
<p>Wedding of the year: In Suvereto, near Livorno in Italy, a bride and groom had arranged for the bride's bouquet to be tossed to the brides-maids and single female guests from a small plane. But the flowers somehow got sucked into the engine and the plane caught fire, exploded, and plunged into a hostel, Corriere della Sera reported. One person was badly hurt.</p>
<p>You can see she's got a future in politics: Paula Abdul, asked about a report that Simon Cowell had asked her out on a date, answered this way: "There's some truth to that, and no truth to it."</p>
<p>You've got mail - and clamydia: Brazil's health ministry set up a website you can use to warn your sexual partners, by email, that you have a sexually transmitted disease.</p>
<p>New ways to be a chick magnet (#1 in a series): In Afghanistan, Cpl. Christopher Reynolds of the Black Watch (the Scottish one, not the Montreal one) has made the longest recorded kill by a sniper, gunning down an Afghan drug lord - hey, that's his story and he's sticking to it - at a range of almost one mile.</p>
<p>"I was quite proud of that shot," Cpl. Reynolds told the Daily Express. "I am going to use that fact as a chat-up line in the pub when I get back home."</p>
<p>Politician of the year: If you crossed Hugh Hefner with Mackenzie King, you'd have Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, still in office after a year of scandals involving prostitutes, strippers, models, his quasi-secret hideaway Villa Certosa, etc., etc. I say nothing of his financial scandals.</p>
<p>At one point before she left him, his wife Veronica Lario spoke up to denounce the old goat's habit of appointing showgirls to be his party's candidates for the European Parliament. She also mocked him for turning up at the 18th birthday party of a blonde model whose parents he knows: "It really surprised me, given that he never went to the 18th birthday parties of his own children."</p>
<p>Teacher of the year: Crystal Defanti, a Grade 5 teacher near Sacramento, Calif., gave each of her students an end-of-year gift: a DVD she made herself, with footage of school events, outings, prize-givings - and her on a sofa, naked and intimate with a boyfriend.</p>
<p>It was an accident, she said, apologizing. This being California, the school board didn't fire her.</p>
<p>Annals of crime-fighting: Kwara State Police, in Nigeria, arrested a goat suspected of car theft. A police official explained that two guys stealing a <span class="companylink">Mazda</span> were chased off by righteous citizens and "while one of them escaped, the other was about to be apprehended by the team when he turned his back ... and turned into this goat."</p>
<p>I can find no follow-up, but I'm pretty sure this case ended in capital punishment, a nice marinade, and some delicious kebabs.</p>
<p>"Men are pigs" dept.: Mel Gibson, Jon Gosselin, David Letterman, Ronnie Wood, Gordon Ramsay, John Edwards, Mark Sanford, Eddie Cibrian, and, of course, Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>My favourite is Sanford, governor of South Carolina, who was supposedly "hiking the Appalachian trail," when, in fact, he was in South America with a mistress. All over South Carolina, guys in bars started getting slapped in the face just for inviting girls to go hiking.</p>
<p>This never happens to Horatio Kane: When German cops found the same female DNA at 39 different crime scenes, over two years, they were sure they had a serial killer who also dabbled in other types of crime. But it turned out that all 39 samples matched the factory worker who had made the cotton swabs cops use to collect samples at crime scenes.</p>
<p>Criminal of the year: Police say they caught Claude Menard, 58, of Windsor, Ont., driving while drinking not one but two beers. When they pulled him over and asked for his licence, he allegedly handed them a bag of marijuana.</p>
<p>"Hi Mom. Can you guess where I am right now?" Nepal Telecom announced plans to provide cellphone service on the top of Mount Everest. Next year, I suppose, there'll be a Tim Horton's up there.</p>
<p>The leaders of tomorrow: In Swansea, Wales, more than 2,500 people - mostly university students - dressed up and painted up as Smurfs for a party at Oceana, a night club. This more than doubled the previous world record for most nitwits in blue paint.</p>
<p>And the organizers aren't finished yet. "We are hoping to set, break and smash Guinness World Records for iconic characters from Daleks to</p>
<p>Superheroes," said one.</p>
<p>Thanks for nothing, kid: A Tel Aviv woman identified as Anat bought her mother a new mattress, as a surprise gift, and had the old one hauled away to the dump.</p>
<p>Mom was not pleased, however, since she had her life savings - currency worth about $1 million U.S. - squirrelled away in the old mattress.</p>
<p>Oh, man, no more space? I was just getting started. But I suppose there's a limit to how awful a year can be. I hope so, anyway, because from here it looks like 2010 will have all the same old problems, plus who can say what new ones?</p>
<p>Oh well. You've got to keep trying, or laughing, or drinking. Maybe all three. Happy New Year, folks!</p>

<p>2001: The Year of the Xtreme Football League: "Equal parts of media hype, violence, mediocrity, cleavage, inanity and financial failure. It was loud, it was rude, it was stupid, it was unoriginal, it was sleazy, it was cheap, it was oversold."</p>
<p>2000: The Year of Marty McSorley: "Every time I see that replay (3,478 times and counting), I get a little shiver of patriotic pride. McSorley whacks that poor Donald Brashear just the way a stereotypical Canadian lumberjack chops into a tall pine - we're talking genuine national symbol here."</p>
<p>1999: The Year of Jar Jar Binks. Yousa knowa Jar Jar? The Phantom Menace character, which the Spectator mag called "a cross between a homosexual donkey and lop-eared rabbit," was not the best-loved Star Wars character.</p>
<p>1998: The Year of Social Union: "Canadians earnestly, sincerely believe that it's somehow better, nobler, more Canadian, to quibble over compensation for opting out of any new non-shared-cost welfare programs in provincial jurisdiction than to snigger over (Bill Clinton and his) blow ... uhhh, over a good political sex scandal."</p>
<p>1997: The Year of Howard Stern: "Malign energy, synthetic emotion, media manipulation, bad taste and comic excess."</p>
<p>1996: The Year of the Macarena: "Inane, peppy and quasi-mechanical."</p>
<p>1995: "The year before the Internet fad collapsed." I see now that I was premature, not wrong. The Internet remains "a worldwide network of Star Trek fans, corporate advertisers, amateur pornographers, failed authors, religious zealots, suicidal maniacs, pretentious rock stars, Gilligan's Island fans, gun nuts, and teenage dweebs unable to get a date."</p>
<p>1994: Oh, that's enough of this.</p>
<p>Enough Already</p>
<p>How serene and pleasant life would be if only we could hear no more, ever, about the following: sexting; Farmville; Roman Polanski; Taylor Swift and Kanye West; Christian Bale ranting; "green shoots;" Susan Boyle; Lost; "death panels;" Tiger and his lady friends; Labradoodles; "Balloon Boy;" Shepard Fairey; Spencer and Heidi and all who care about them even a little; John Mayer; "birthers"; Chesley Sullenberger; "25 random things about ..."; the web comic xkcd; Rod Blagojevich; Caster Semanya; Lizzie Miller; celebrities adopting Third World kids; Glee; Heath Ledger; Twitter; "stimulus;" Jorma Hogbacka; "I want to go to there;" Nadya Suleman; Liskula Cohen; Madonna's arms; Cheetos-flavoured lip balm; Cheesus the Christ-shaped Cheeto; So You Think You Can Dance?; Bo the First Dog; Massive Dynamics; the Phoenix Coyotes; "Baracknophobia;" Karl ... Karlhei ... Herr Schrei ... nope, I just can't bring myself to type his name; Sarah Palin and Levi Johnston; "quantitative easing;" Samantha Ronson; "Will it Blend?"; Lady Gaga; "bromance;" Nouriel Roubini; seal meat; Ultimate Fighting Championship; "unfriend;" stress tests; ashleymadison.com; the Beatles; the Battle of the Plains of Abraham; Jade Goody; bankers' bonuses; Brüno; coalition government; "there's an app for that"; Michael Bay vs. Megan Fox; Julia Child; Jon and Kate Gosselin; Anvil! The Story of Anvil!; Michael Jackson; and, as always, poor sad Barry Manilow.</p>

</p>
<p>It was the year of vampires and bloodsuckers, as fiction lovers feasted on undead heroes and the news dined on dead celebrities.</p>
<p>Vancouver mooned over New Moon as B.C. entered the Twilight zone and Harry Potter became "The Boy Who Was Yesterday's Pop Culture Phenom."</p>
<p>Balloon Boy was a bust, Susan Boyle was a must and Octomom was ... just plain disturbing.</p>
<p>Seriously, the Octomom thing ... creepy.</p>
<p>Trevor Linden retired, Mats Messier expired. Tony Parsons weighed anchor, but Bill Vander Zalm won't go away.</p>
<p>"Unfriended" was the word of the year and if you don't know what that means I'll tweet you about it.</p>
<p>Sexting replaced texting, which was a shock for a generation still getting used to e-mail.</p>
<p>It was the year pigs had wings as swine flu replaced bird flu -prompting a panic about the lack of vaccine by people who were in a panic to take the vaccine.</p>
<p>Alleged Prime Minister Stephen Harper sang the Beatles with Yo Yo Ma while Michael Ignatieff sang the coalition blues.</p>
<p>Premier Gordon Campbell invited the world for 2010 with a campaign showing off B.C.'s arts and culture, because the province is cutting off all funding for arts and culture after 2010.</p>
<p>The Bachelorette was from B.C., but still couldn't get online to buy Olympic tickets.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, arrived in B.C. and were immediately mistaken for Olympic mascots, Miga and Quatchi.</p>
<p>The Dalai Lama visited Vankarma to talk peace, but lost his temper when forced to drive down Cambie Street.</p>
<p>Osama bin Laden is still at large, but Polanski is no longer roaming.</p>
<p>Canada's hottest new music star was Leonard Cohen, prompting Avril Lavigne to make plans for her 80th birthday tour.</p>
<p>Tiger was a hound. Kanye West went south.</p>
<p>Paula Abdul-cated American Idol.</p>
<p>And Lady Gaga made the world miss the good old days when the always-demure Madonna did more than adopt African babies.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No shortage of Canadian political problems in 2009; The beginning and the end of the year found us wondering how Ottawa will go about ridding itself of a bulging federal deficit</b>

</p>
<p>How will we remember the political year that was 2009?</p>
<p>During the past dozen months Canada's two main parties experienced see-saw swings in support, while offering few solutions to the country's most daunting policy dilemmas.</p>
<p>As at the beginning of 2009, Canadians were left wondering at the end of the year how Ottawa will go about ridding itself of a bulging federal deficit that has ensconced itself on the Canadian body politic.</p>
<p>Wondering, too, how the country will reconcile Alberta oil-sands expansion with the imperatives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
<p>And what Ottawa will do as a NATO member to address the mayhem and murder in Afghanistan post-2011 as a deadline for the Canadian Forces' military withdrawal fast approaches. While these hot potatoes simmered, the political parties were on full boil with their own problems.</p>
<p>Liberals, last January, were raring to go with their new leader, Michael Ignatieff. Polls had them tied with the governing Conservatives by the time the tulips bloomed in Ottawa. Then -- whoosh -- all the petals fell off in the cool autumn air as Liberal support cratered.</p>
<p>The Conservatives, meanwhile, who were in the dumpster in early January following Stephen Harper's desperate appeal for a parliamentary recess last Christmas, spent 2009 climbing steadily in the polls.</p>
<p>The party's support reached majority territory by October when the PM dared to play the piano for voters at a National Arts Centre gala and, in doing so, looked--ye gods--human.</p>
<p>It was a year when New Democrats had some success, finding gut-punching issues to champion -- the harmonized sales tax adoption in B.C. and Ontario, and the pensions plight. But the party remains no closer to convincing voters it's a realistic governing alternative at the federal level. The election everyone widely anticipated throughout the year never did materialize. But at least the notion has been put to bed for a while, given the Grits' faltering condition. Meanwhile, a Nanos poll announced in December that Canadians are in a better mood than a year ago, with 64 per cent thinking Canada is moving in the right direction, up from 53 per cent in 2008.</p>
<p>Some fun stuff happened in 2009 as well.Gov.-Gen. Michaelle Jean got herself a new Afro hairdo. Defence Minister Peter MacKay finally got himself a would-be wife in Jana Juginovic. And U.S. President Barack Obama paid a visit to Ottawa, for a few hours.</p>
<p>Prince Charles and Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, also dropped in and stayed longer, but, in terms of excitement and crowds, there was no contest between the two visits.</p>
<p>Canada got nine new Conservative senators in 2009, to join 18 others appointed last December. The tally currently is 46 Conservative senators and 51 Liberals. Any guesses about which party will lay claim to the six additional seats in the Red Chamber that will need filling by the end of 2010?</p>
<p>This was a year when Canadians finally got the truth, or as near as they'll ever get, in two separate government inquiries: the Braidwood Inquiry into the 2007 Vancouver International Airport death of Robert Dziekanski after he was repeatedly Tasered by four Mounties and the Oliphant Inquiry into business dealings between Brian Mulroney and Karlheinz Schreiber. Testimony at both events was nauseating.</p>
<p>It was also a year for hand-wringing about climate change and how Canada's petro-powered economy is going to adapt to a new world order.</p>
<p>A year, too, for hand-washing as people got the willies about the H1N1 virus even if they didn't get the flu itself. Of course, the past dozen months were devoted to preparing for Vancouver's 2010 Olympic Games, a spectacle that lent the year end a delicious air of excited anticipation.</p>

</p>
<p>I am old enough to remember reading The Late Great Planet Earth by author Hal Lindsey during the late 1970s. The premise of the book was based on Christian eschatology and how prophecies of the end times were unfolding before our very eyes. The book predicted an increase in earthquakes, pestilence, famines and wars, which, at the time, seemed a bit of an exaggeration.</p>
<p>As I recall the '70s, besides having some of the lamest music ever recorded, there seemed to be a lot fewer of the aforementioned signs of the end of the world than there are today. In the past decade alone, we have had SARS, Mad Cow Disease, Avian flu and H1N1. It seems every time a new viral strain emerges, we have the potential of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Then there's the growing tension between Iran and Israel, war in Afghanistan and Pakistan, with the growing fear about some extremist terrorist group getting access to nukes. Even the Mayans are getting into it by predicting the end of the world at exactly 11:11 a.m., December 12, 2012. It is, therefore, no coincidence that two of my favourite cartoons I drew this year are based on the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse.</p>
<p>Speaking of End Times, I should mention how much I've enjoyed cartooning the floundering Liberal party. Polls indicate that the party is in a free fall under the leadership of Michael Ignatieff and, as it turns out, he has quickly become one of my favourite targets of all time.</p>
<p>I thought Stéphane Dion was great fodder, but I have to say Ignatieff is like manna from heaven. It's been so difficult for Ignatieff that he even appointed an old Chrétien aide, Peter Donolo, as his chief of staff. Please, Donolo, don't change a thing; I like Michael Ignatieff exactly as he is.</p>
<p>This was also the first year of Barack Obama's presidency. After a slow start, editorial cartoonists have successfully been able to draw cartoons critical of the man and his policies without concern that by doing so we would unwittingly stir up racial imagery, or, more likely, too greatly upset his adoring fans.</p>
<p>Obama showed that he is not superhuman and a sense of public disappointment is beginning to set in.</p>
<p>As I reflect on his presidency, it strikes me as marked by contradictions. He has presided over a jobless recovery, and has received the Nobel Peace Prize while escalating the war in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>I'm not sure where this is headed, but suddenly, in cartoons, we see him being drawn shorter and with bigger ears. The mystique is falling away.</p>
<p>One of the highlights for me this year was winning the National Newspaper Award for editorial cartooning. It was my second NNA and, as happened the first time I won, the hardest cartoon to draw was the one immediately following. I still remember how I felt after the first win, as if I needed to prove why I was chosen.</p>
<p>This year was no different and I produced what I consider one of my better efforts: a drawing that featured Uncle Sam in an old saloon scene with Kim Jong Il quoting the line, "I am become Death ..." Some cartoons I like better than others, and I like that one.</p>
<p>Editorial cartoons that work best are those featuring a nice graphic with beautiful rendering, backed by a solid editorial statement. But these things are often matters of personal taste, and can vary from reader to reader.</p>
<p>All my cartoons won't be to everyone's liking, but my hope is that more often than not they will resonate.</p>
<p>As for next year, I think we're still OK. The Mayans didn't mention 2010.</p>

<p>Not in the '00s, a decade riven with uncertainty and the fear of asteroids, BSE, SARS,</p>
<p>avian flu, swine flu, bio-engineered viruses, nanotechnology, nuclear war, global warming and countless other doomsday scenarios</p>
<p>By Robert Sibley</p>
<p>... Uncertain and afraid</p>
<p>As the clever hopes expire</p>
<p>Of a low dishonest decade:</p>
<p>Waves of anger and fear</p>
<p>Circulate over the bright</p>
<p>And darkened lands of the earth ...</p>
<p>-- W.H. Auden, September 1, 1939.</p>
<p>t is a mere calendar convention that sees us mark the arrival and departure of a new decade with the neat demarcations of zero. Historical periods, as journalist George Packer observes, seldom conform to clean-cut, 10-year periods. Rather, "eras are defined less precisely but more truly by events, a prevailing moral atmosphere, what it felt like to live during a certain time."</p>
<p>The Depression era -- the Dirty Thirties -- stretched from the Wall Street collapse on Oct. 29, 1929, to the opening salvoes of the Second World War on Sept. 1, 1939. The Sixties were a decade of hedonism and hysteria, beginning with John Kennedy's assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, and ending with the last helicopter lifting off the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon on April 29, 1975. The 1990s were a 12-year holiday from history -- or, perhaps, a fantasy about the end of history -- that began with the fall of the Berlin Wall on Nov. 9, 1989, and concluded with the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.</p>
<p>What about this first decade of the 21st century? It has been a short one, I would argue. It began, obviously, with the 9/11 terrorist strikes on the Twin Towers, zigzagged through the dot.com bubble and Enron, segued into nasty wars on the bloody borders of the West (still ongoing), and wrapped up with the collapse of <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> in September 2008 and the near-meltdown of the world's financial system.</p>
<p>Some, no doubt, will wish to conclude this foreshortened decade on a positive note, preferring Barack Obama's assumption of the U.S. presidency in January as a more suitable ending. The new president certainly offered the rhetoric of hope, at least for a few months, but it is the debacle in the financial system that endures. In any case, if, as Packer suggests, eras are marked by "what it felt like to live" during that period, by its "moral atmosphere," then it seems to me the seven years between 9/11 and the onset of the global financial crisis possessed a particular moral atmosphere, a distinct "feel."</p>
<p>This decade was certainly marked by uncertainty. Whether it was fear of terrorist attacks, puzzlement at the weaknesses of nation-states, bewilderment at the way technology continues to alter human relationships (think of the emergence of social media), concern about mass migration and demographic change, or even an inchoate sense of a dispirited world spinning out of control, there is little question the '00s were as riven with anxiety as the '90s were cocooned in complacency.</p>
<p>If so, it is not unreasonable to describe the past decade as an age of anxiety, or, more accurately perhaps, an era of displaced anxiety. And if that is the case, as I contend, then it seems to me the singular characteristic of the new century's first decade -- its "feel," if you will -- was moral panic.</p>
<p>British sociologist Stanley Cohen coined the phrase "moral panic" to describe the public reaction to the huge fights between English gangs -- the working-class Rockers and the middle-class Mods -- during the 1960s. Newspapers portrayed the clashes in sensational terms, casting them as a symptom of Britain's cultural and geo-political decline.</p>
<p>Cohen, however, thought the media were indulging in moral panic; that is to say, promoting unwarranted concern about an ostensible threat posed to the values and principles that sustain an orderly society. The characteristics of moral panic are, he wrote, "a condition, episode, person or group of persons (that) become defined as a threat to societal values and interests." Cohen labelled the promoters of moral panic -- whether politicians, interest groups, academics or journalists -- as "moral entrepreneurs" who, unwittingly or otherwise, amplify the nature of a particular situation out of all proportion to its reality and, thus, generate widespread fear and anxiety.</p>
<p>Moral panics have a long history. Adolf Hitler's warning in 1938 that "the Jew will destroy civilization by poisoning us all" was an extreme example of moral panic. But history is replete with collective panic attacks -- from the witch hunts of 17th century Europe and white slavery in Victorian England to claims of widespread satanic ritual abuse in North America during the 1960s and, most recently, the oh-my-gawd-we're-all-gonna-die hysteria surrounding swine flu.</p>
<p>But panics occur at even the most mundane level. Barry Cooper, a political scientist at the University of Calgary, points out that small-town religious leaders denounced the arrival of the car and the radio in the 1920s as conducive to backseat sex. Most every dance craze or musical fashion from the waltz to rap has been condemned for promoting immoral behaviour. "Moral panics are reactions to bad events that, to common sense, seem disproportionate," says Cooper. And "indignation and outrage" are the most common tone of those who promote moral panic. (You hear a great deal of moral entrepreneurship during question period in the House of Commons.)</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>Moral panic may seem a puzzling characterization of our times. Despite our economic woes, the threat of terrorist attacks, the ongoing war in Afghanistan and concerns about "global warming" and "climate change," most of us continue to enjoy the bounty of prosperity and technology: plentiful food, decent shelter, warm clothing, reasonably safe streets, general good health, a wealth of cultural opportunities, and a host of high-tech diversions to keep ourselves entertained.</p>
<p>Yet we are fearful and anxious. "Fear plays a key role in 21st century consciousness," says British sociologist Frank Furedi. "The rise of catch phrases such as the 'politics of fear,' 'fear of crime' and 'fear of the future' is testimony to the cultural significance of fear today. Many of us seem to make sense of our experiences through the narrative of fear." Indeed, historian Joanna Bourke regards fear as "the most pervasive emotion of modern society."</p>
<p>The 2004 U.S. election provided some good (read: bad) examples of the politics of fear. The Republicans ran advertisements showing growling wolves slouching through a dark wood, while a voiceover warned the electorate "weakness attracts those who are waiting to do America harm." The Democrats were no better, with Al Gore ringing the bell of doom with his warnings about Iraq as another Vietnam and the imminence of environmental apocalypse. We've seen something similar, if sillier, in recent Canadian elections, when the Liberals and New Democrats cast Conservative leader Stephen Harper as an ogre.</p>
<p>The political use of fear is more than a campaign tactic, however. It would not be effective if it did not reflect a prevailing mindset. Perhaps the most obvious example of moral panic is the overblown anxiety attached to environmental concerns. Opinion polls consistently show that many Canadians and Americans are convinced environmental catastrophe is around the corner, that we'll soon run out of natural resources (including oxygen) and that population growth dooms us to mass starvation -- never mind that such dire warnings have been around for 40 years and, so far, none has come true.</p>
<p>Paul Ehrlich's The Population Bomb, published in 1968, warned of mass planetary starvation by the 1980s. In 1972, the Club of Rome predicted apocalypse by overpopulation. Both theses ended up on the compost heap of history in the wake of the Green Revolution. The biggest fear in the 1970s, though, was global cooling. In late 1972, a group of scientists wrote to then U.S. president Richard Nixon, saying the world's climate might change by an "order of magnitude larger than any hitherto experience by civilized mankind."</p>
<p>The media loved the idea, of course. By 1974, Time magazine reported that "a growing number of scientists" studying "the bizarre and unpredictable weather pattern of the past several years" were wondering if "a global climatic upheaval" might be in the works. "There are ominous signs that the Earth's weather patterns have begun to change dramatically," Newsweek declared in 1975, "and that these changes may portend a dramatic decline in food production -- with serious implications for just about every nation on Earth."</p>
<p>Since the 1990s, we've heard dire warnings from numerous moral entrepreneurs -- Al Gore and David Suzuki come to mind -- but freezing is no longer fashionable. Today's popular doomsday scenario is that we'll fry, drown or choke to death because of "global warming" and/or "climate change." As Barry Cooper says, "the biggest moral panic" nowadays is that surrounding the question of climate change and what role, if any, humans play in it.</p>
<p>Sundry "experts" often turn themselves into moral entrepreneurs, inadvertently or not. "Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster, such as global warming, nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers we have no yet thought of," Stephen Hawking, the celebrated physicist, said in a 2006 lecture.</p>
<p>But moral panic is not simply associated with high-profile threats such as terrorist attacks or "global warming." There is also the constant anxiety of everyday life that makes us, in political theorist Zygmunt Bauman's phrase, prone to being "neurotic about matters of security." As journalist Christopher Booker and Richard North, an environmental health officer, write, the "environmental scare" is of a piece with other "moral panics" that grip the western mind -- everything from AIDS and BSE to SARS, avian flu, and, most recently, swine flu (or H1N1 as the technocrats prefer).</p>
<p>n</p>
<p>I don't want to suggest that concerns about the environment are unwarranted, or that concerns about pandemics, geo-political events and economic problems are unjustified. Clearly we should clean up the rivers and lakes, minimize pollution and curb deforestation. What is problematic about many of our moral panics, though, is the mood of catastrophism, the implication mankind is doomed to do itself in unless extraordinary measures are undertaken and immense sacrifices made. Such rhetoric -- the rhetoric of fear -- is fertile soil for demagogues and authoritarian rule.</p>
<p>"Our constitution continues to work, the courts continue to work, and people by and large continue to conform to the laws and policies that compromise our social and political order," says Carleton University political theorist Peter Emberley. "Yet we have this kind of self-fabricated conception that we are on the brink, that we're on the edge of some world-ending abyss, that the apocalypse is just around the corner."</p>
<p>But then even if the end-times fail to live up to their billing, if the flu viruses lack virility, well, we still have plenty of moral entrepreneurs to warn us about second-hand cigarette smoke and obesity. It sometimes seems we are half in love with dreams of doom, at least judging by our proclivity for and response to disaster movies. NASA received dozens of phone calls and e-mails from people frightened 2012 might come true. One woman, according to news reports, wondered if she could avoid the disaster by killing her daughter, her unborn baby and herself. Another asked whether she should euthanize her dog so it wouldn't suffer in 2012. But 2012, which is based on much-debated Mayan prophecies of doom, is only the latest is a long list of end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it films -- from 2004's The Day After Tomorrow and the Road Warrior trilogy in the early 1980s to Planet of the Apes in 1968, When World's Collide in 1951, and, in 1938, Orson Welles' radio broadcast of H.G. Wells' story War of the Worlds. That broadcast, incidentally, created panic throughout the United States, as many believed the Martians really were invading.</p>
<p>Our sense of panic is only inflated by books such as Our Final Century, by Royal Society president Martin Rees, who lists bio-engineered viruses, asteroids, nanotechnology and nuclear war as among the many dangers we face. Tomes on peak oil theory such as Richard Heinberg's The Party's Over and The Long Emergency by James Kunstler take moral panic to pragmatic levels.</p>
<p>Perhaps this propensity for doom mongering is something of a cultural peccadillo, an impulse rooted in our Christian heritage and its prophecies of end-times and the Judgement Day to come. On the other hand, doomsday movies and books -- say, for example, Cormac McCarthy's The Road, or Stephen King's The Stand, or, my favourite, George Stewart's Earth Abides, a 1949 novel in which most of the human race falls victim to an airborne pandemic -- may provide a cathartic release from the undercurrent of anxiety that, in the words of British sociologist Phil Hubbard, "saturates the social space of everyday life."</p>
<p>Psychologists and sociologists have linked our inclination for moral panic to the rapidity of social, political and technological change. Shifts in long-established social traditions and moral standards -- the waning of traditional marriage and the emergence of same-sex marriage, for example -- are psychically unsettling, they say. Too much change too fast leaves people disoriented and uprooted, which fosters an anxiety-inducing feeling that the world is increasingly senseless and, therefore, meaningless.</p>
<p>"Rather than learning to cope with (rapid social change), we are in fact becoming more vulnerable to experiencing our world as a place of threatening uncertainty," says British sociologist Iain Wilkinson. The result, he says, is "a growing 'sense of crisis' that has produced "a 'social state of mind' which is pessimistic to the point of 'paralysing desperation'." Wilkinson draws on the thought of scholars to argue that "'we have got used to talking as though the future is not only provisional, but is dominated by dangers rather than opportunities'."</p>
<p>This crisis of self-confidence has consequences, both for the individual and society. At the social level, citizens are increasingly open to the blandishments of the moral entrepreneurs, who, in their warnings of bad things to come, promise that they can solve our uncertainty, ease our anxiety. And therein lies the real threat. Misplaced anxiety opens the door to the politics of fear and the temptations of political demagogues, and, ultimately, to the soft totalitarianism of rule-by-experts. Anxious and uncertain, a panic-prone citizenry lacks not only the moral stamina to insist on the rule of common sense, but also the moral courage to defend its freedom.</p>
<p>At the individual level, living under the constant strain of anxiety may well prompt a flight to whatever diversions -- from video games and pornography to drugs and celebrity worship -- offer a release from fear or numb the undercurrent of anxiety. People stop thinking about the future -- including, arguably, avoiding having children -- because the future looks too scary. Better to live for the present.</p>
<p>"It's possible that people don't have high hopes for the future. It does strike me that we don't talk about the future anymore in sweeping terms," says Waller Newell, a political theorist at Carleton University. He suggests our anxiety, our moral panic, is rooted in the fear of things slipping away. "There's nothing epoch-making that collectively excites us. We don't have any great millennial expectations. We want to hold on to what we've got."</p>
<p>No great expectations. A sad epitaph for a decade, to be sure, but that was the moral atmosphere of the last seven years, that's what it felt like.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1, Chalk River made it a busy 2009 for rookie health minister</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>769 words</div><div>26 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A16</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq had many worries as she led Canada's response to the H1N1 pandemic this year, but one personal anxiety often trumped all others -- her son.</p>
<p>"My biggest fear ... was that I would get H1N1 and bring it home to my son and to my husband," Aglukkaq said in a recent interview following her 49th press conference on the pandemic. "That was very stressful."</p>
<p>She was travelling a lot, constantly interacting with people, including health-care workers, and Aglukkaq could have easily picked up the virus along her way.</p>
<p>"It was at the back of my mind, if I get this flu I'm not going to my house because there's no vaccine yet," she said.</p>
<p>Like other parents, she anxiously awaited its approval so that her 18-month-old son, Cooper, could be protected from the H1N1 virus. He was immunized as soon as the vaccine was made available to Canadians in late October.</p>
<p>"I would say it's been a very interesting, rewarding, challenging year for me," the health minister said.</p>
<p>Challenging indeed for a minister who had just barely settled into the job after arriving on Parliament Hill in the fall of 2008.</p>
<p>It was baptism by fire for the new MP, who, within weeks of being sworn-in as health minister, was dealing with a medical isotope shortage because of a shutdown at the Chalk River reactor facility.</p>
<p>A few months later, a mystery virus in Mexico turned into a worldwide pandemic and Aglukkaq was the lead minister in charge of Canada's response. At the same time, Chalk River shut down again, this time indefinitely. In between managing the pandemic and the ongoing isotope shortage, Aglukkaq was trying to push tobacco legislation and a bill on consumer product safety through the House of Commons.</p>
<p>She's faced her share of criticism and skepticism about whether a rookie minister such as herself is competent enough to handle the job.</p>
<p>The soft-spoken 42-year-old says the only person she needs to prove anything to is herself.</p>
<p>She's new to the federal scene, yes, but she's had a long career in public service, Aglukkaq notes. She was a municipal councillor for six years before moving to territorial government, where she served as deputy minister for several portfolios and, when elected as a member of the legislative assembly in Nunavut, she was named finance minister, house leader and then health minister.</p>
<p>"I might come from what they call a small territory, but my riding is bigger and larger than Ontario. Three time zones, 25 isolated communities, and to deliver health care in that environment is far more challenging than downtown Toronto," said Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>She's been open and honest with Canadians, the health minister says, and she purposefully resists partisan comebacks when under attack from the opposition.</p>
<p>"At the end of the day, as a Canadian, as an individual from this country, if I saw my health minister and whoever, getting into the games of party politics instead of health and safety, I would be concerned," she explained.</p>
<p>But Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett flatly rejects Aglukkaq's claims that she's been transparent and stayed above the political fray.</p>
<p>"I am so sad about the partisan nature and that when we were trying to be constructive, trying to help, we would just get outright nonsense," said Bennett, her party's health critic.</p>
<p>Bennett said she had "high hopes" for Aglukkaq when she was appointed because she was familiar with her "excellent experience and record." When Aglukkaq was health minister at the territorial level, Bennett was Canada's minister of state for public health at the federal level.</p>
<p>Now, Bennett says she is "unbelievably disappointed" by Aglukkaq's performance. She's not communicating well with Canadians, not listening to the provinces and territories and has shown a partisan streak, said Bennett.</p>
<p>"This is not the Leona I knew as the minister in Nunavut. ... I just can't believe that she can say what she is being asked to say in terms of the partisanship," said the Toronto MP.</p>
<p>The health minister, however, says she's been guided by the expectations of Canadians over the last year.</p>
<p>"My task here was to focus on what would a Canadian want of me and what would I expect of my health minister if we were in the middle of a pandemic," said Aglukkaq.</p>

year as 'interesting, rewarding, challenging.'   </p>

<p>- - Kudos go to the woman who put one-and-a-half shopping carts full of toys directly into the Santas Anonymous bin at the <span class="companylink">Toys R Us</span> store on the south side. If only there were more people like her.</p>
<p>- - It's been so cold lately, I've let my Journal warm up on the register before reading it. I can't help but wonder what it must be like delivering the newspaper in the middle of the night. Bless our carriers.</p>
<p>- - We want to thank the three young people who helped us get our truck unstuck in -25 C weather. There was a nasty ice patch at the entrance to the car wash and we slid straight into a two-foot snowdrift. While several other people drove by, these young people got out and pushed until we were free. They were our guardian angels.</p>
<p>- - I was in <span class="companylink">Walmart</span> when I saw a medical emergency. The store's first-aid person wasn't responding to the page, so I stepped forward to help and asked the cashier to put my items aside. All turned out well -- the patient is doing fine -- so when the medical personnel arrived, I returned to the till to pay. My items were already bagged and the cashier said the man behind me in line paid for my $37 worth of purchases. How heartwarming.</p>
<p>- - Due credit to all the staff at Edmonton's H1N1 flu clinics for their efforts in carrying out the Herculean task of immunizing tens of thousands of citizens in such a short time. They carried out their work with efficiency and an excellent attitude.</p>

</div><div>Misty Harris   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1369 words</div><div>26 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Call it two-thousand-and-swine: the year we were either sick with H1N1 or just plain sick of hearing about it. On the economic front, pink slips became the new black, while the entertainment world tried to make sense of a deity that took Michael Jackson, Patrick Swayze and Brittany Murphy but somehow left the cast of New Moon unscathed.</p>
<p>Of course, 2009 wasn't without its uplifting moments -- none more literal than those courtesy of "balloon boy." And you can't deny the fun factor of a year that, in the span of two days, saw U.S. President Barack Obama win the Nobel Peace Prize, NASA bomb the moon and Marge Simpson pose for Playboy.</p>
<p>Today, we look back at the moments that put the pop in Canadian culture in 2009.</p>
<p>The Newsmakers</p>
<p>1. Michael Jackson</p>
<p>The King of Pop's untimely death left the world struggling to reconcile the legend who brought them Thriller with the man-child who sought shelter among children and monkeys at a ranch called Neverland. The singer's online memorial service was watched by an estimated one billion people worldwide.</p>
<p>2. Jon and Kate Gosselin Not since Brad gave Jen her walking papers have culture vultures been so swept up in a celebrity divorce, with millions tuning into TLC to witness the reality-TV couple's unravelling. The Gosselins eventually took their fight to the tabloids, making them harder to avoid than the flu -- and equally bad for public health.</p>
<p>3. Tiger Woods</p>
<p>This year, America's highest-earning athlete turned into a one-man infideli-tainment show, with allegations of extramarital sex romps, conspiratorial voice messages and enough rumoured mistresses to make Charl ie Sheen blush. Amid talks of a high-priced divorce, Woods announced a hiatus from golf -- and, presumably, cocktail waitresses.</p>
<p>4. Nadya "Octomom" Suleman</p>
<p>Talk about a womb with a view: in January, Suleman gave birth to octuplets -- only the second full set born alive in the U.S. -- which took her tally of children to 14 from six. When it came to light that the single mother was unemployed and living on public assistance, widespread debate ensued over the ethical use of assisted reproductive technology.</p>
<p>5. Lady Gaga</p>
<p>With four No. 1 hits, a relentless appearance schedule, and a fashion sense so eclectic as to make Bjork's swan dress look understated, the singer earned enough media coverage this year to drain a small city's ink supplies.</p>
<p>Also newsworthy: Michael Phelps (we learned there was more behind the Olympic swimmer's red eyes than chlorine after he was photographed taking a hit off a bong); singer Susan Boyle (she "dreamed a dream" and it came true, with her debut album drawing the biggest opening-week sales of any album this year); Sarah Palin (the former U.S. vice-presidential candidate went "rogue" with a new book, and we were all forced along for the ride).</p>
<p>The Moments</p>
<p>1. Celebrity deaths</p>
<p>It's hard to recall a recent year in which there were as many premature celebrity deaths as were seen in 2009. Among the most startling losses were Brittany Murphy, 32, Jett Travolta, 16, Exodus Tyson 4, Natasha Richardson, 45, David Carradine, 72, Farrah Fawcett, 62, John Hughes, 59, DJ AM, 36, Patrick Swayze, 57, and, of course, Michael Jackson, 50.</p>
<p>2. Social media</p>
<p>With more than 420 million users between them, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter and LinkedIn are perfect examples of how social media are, to a large extent, becoming the new mass media. At the height of June's Iranian protests, Twitter emerged as one of the most reliable sources of communication from the front lines when text messaging and mobile services were severed by authorities.</p>
<p>Time magazine subsequently reported that "the Revolution will not be televised, but it will be tweeted."</p>
<p>3. Undead mania</p>
<p>If Anne Rice wasn't embarrassed for her genre already, 2009 surely did the trick, with everything from bloodthirsty Barbie dolls to vampirethemed sanitary napkins hitting the market. Most notably, the Twilight sequel New Moon saw its gaggle of glittering vamps set a record for the biggest single-day domestic gross ever at the box office, with the movie going on to earn more than $626 million US worldwide. Zombies came a close second, thanks to the surprise lit-hit Pride and Prejudice and Zombies and the Woody Harrelson zom-com Zombieland.</p>
<p>4. Balloon boy</p>
<p>Three days after the world was held captive by live footage of a giant runaway balloon said to be carrying six-year-old Falcon Heene, investigators discovered the whole thing was a hoax.</p>
<p>Somewhere in Hollywood, Pixar producers breathed a sigh of relief that the movie Up wouldn't have to be augmented with a disclaimer.</p>
<p>5. Celebrity Fight Club</p>
<p>Kanye West vs. Taylor Swift, Chris Brown vs. Rihanna, Mariah Carey vs. Eminem, Candy Spelling vs. Tori Spelling, Perez Hilton vs. will. i. am, Gosselin vs. Gosselin, Sarah Palin vs. Levi Johnston, Kiefer Sutherland vs. Jack McCollough. Yes, 2009 was the year the headlines looked less like news stories than boxing fight cards.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>IT WAS A SILLY YEAR</b>

</p>
<p>Well, that was interesting. That's about the best -- and worst -- you can say about 2009, a year that seems to have had twin personalities: one of them profound and sombre, the other a goofy distraction from the important stuff. It was a year marked by continuing struggles with the economy and unemployment, a battle over health-care reform and the H1N1 flu. It's also been 12 wacky months of media frenzy over Jon and Kate Gosselin, the balloon boy, real housewives, Lady Gaga, vampires and more. Um, 2009, we'd like to introduce you to 2009. Can you two get your act together and figure out how to be more cohesive by 2010? It's been exhausting keeping up with both of you. Here's a look at some of the people and events that rocked the pop-culture world this year, from the sublime to the ridiculous.</p>
<p>Fastest fall from grace: The good news for Tiger Woods? He's the Associated Press athlete of the decade. The bad news? Every other recent story about him. The scandal involving the world's best golfer has prompted an avalanche of jokes about his infidelity and alleged mistresses. But is there anything funny about instantly going from a hero to a punch line?</p>
<p>Most unexpected overnight fame: The last time someone became famous for looking like a middle-aged British woman in a dowdy housedress, it was Monty Python. But a video clip of Susan Boyle performing a ballad from Les Miz became a global web sensation. Talk about dreaming an online dream.</p>
<p>Most unwelcome overnight fame: Can someone tell White House party-crashers Tareq and Michaele Salahi their 15 minutes are up?</p>
<p>Most riveting tribute: Michael Jackson's death in June prompted a feeding frenzy of cable coverage, speculation and rumour. But the songs and tributes at the Staples Center memorial service brought humanity to an entertainer who emerged, tragically, as the most talked-about star of the year.</p>
<p>Worst attempt to get attention with a Jiffy Pop look-alike: Remember the day when everyone was sick with anxiety at the thought of a little boy flying around in the sky in a crazy homemade balloon? Well, let's try to forget it -- if only to remind fame-seeking parents such as Richard Heene that hoaxes like this won't get you a reality show.</p>
<p>Best interruption: Captain Chesley (Sully) Sullenberger's spectacular impromptu jet landing in the Hudson River, which turned a potential disaster into a slight change in flight plans.</p>
<p>Worst interruption: Kanye West's uninvited impromptu remarks during Taylor Swift's win at the MTV VMAs. Even if he had brought Sully onstage with him, no one would have clapped.</p>
<p>Most persuasive argument for keeping your mouth shut at work: The audiotape of Christian Bale's expletive-spewing meltdown on the set of Terminator: Salvation.</p>
<p>Least intriguing couple who kept trying to be the most intriguing: Can anyone recall why celebrity journalism was once obsessed with Jon and Kate Gosselin's marital breakup? Ah, yes, that was the pre-Tiger era.</p>
<p>Worst activity to pretend you're doing when you're really in South America and having an affair with your "soulmate": As the married South Carolina Governor Mark Sanford discovered, it's hiking the Appalachian Trail.</p>
<p>Most surprising moment for a late-night host: It seemed like just another weeknight on a talk show until David Letterman dropped a bombshell out of the blue. Describing an alleged extortion plan against him, the Late Show host candidly shared the details and admitted that he had slept with female staffers. At least he didn't turn the revelation into a Top Ten list.</p>
<p>Most disappointing ratings for a not-so-late-night-anymore host: Jay Leno's NBC show at 10 p.m. debuted to about 18 million viewers in September, but the audience plummeted in the months that followed. One bright spot? He's moved "Headlines" back to its rightful place after the monologue.</p>
<p>Best attempt by a movie to deal with the economy: Capitalism: A Love Story was more specifically about the financial meltdown. But Up in the Air, a funny movie about a guy who flies around the country firing people, is just as deep in its own way (and features cameos from real people who've been laid off).</p>
<p>Hottest supernatural creatures: Sexy vampires ruled at the box office with The Twilight Saga: New Moon and on TV with HBO's True Blood and CW's The Vampire Diaries. But let's hear it for werewolves (also in New Moon) and zombies (in the Zombieland flick and the Pride and Prejudice and Zombies book) for being almost as scarily popular.</p>
<p>Hottest controversy with an American Idol connection: Although Paula Abdul leaving the show was an early contender, Adam Lambert's racy performance at the American Music Awards turned out to be much, much more buzz-worthy.</p>
<p>Trends you couldn't ignore (as much as you tried): Bravo's Real Housewives franchise, people yelling at town hall meetings, weird celebrity beards (Joaquin Phoenix and Brad Pitt especially) and Megan Fox mania.</p>
<p>Best nickname: Octomom.</p>
<p>Worst nickname that we're actually starting to like: The Situation from MTV's Jersey Shore.</p>
<p>Most delightful meeting: After out-Madonna-ing Madonna with her daring high-concept costumes and groovy dance hits, Lady Gaga capped a successful year by being introduced to Queen Elizabeth.</p>
<p>Weirdest stunt that wasn't worth it: Sacha Baron Cohen got free publicity when his Bruno character put his derrière cheeks next to Eminem's facial ones at the MTV Movie Awards. But his Bruno film still disappointed at the box office.</p>
<p>Nicest conclusion to a fake romance: Pam and Jim getting hitched on The Office.</p>
<p>Meanest conclusion to a fake romance: After Jason Mesnick proposed to Melissa Rycroft on The Bachelor, he dumped her for the runner-up, Molly Malaney. But Rycroft had the last laugh -- she competed on Dancing With the Stars and just got married to another guy.</p>
<p>Best TV reunion: Larry David brought together the cast of Seinfeld on Curb Your Enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Best TV fresh start: The Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce agency that was launched during the stellar finale to the Mad Men season. If Don Draper is starting a new business, maybe there is hope for the job market.</p>

<p>of Winnipeg's expanding footprint</p>
<p>and a remarkable renovation on Princess</p>

<p>enough to avoid a bust when the economy</p>
<p>went south this past year.</p>
<p>Southern Manitoba in particular continues</p>
<p>to grow and diversify.</p>
<p>As Doer took his leave in the fall for the</p>

<p>For Canadians, it was a decade of quiet yet profound change.</p>
<p>We endured the annual floods, fires and natural disasters with our usual fortitude and resilience. We shuddered over the human disasters -- the sexual predator on Vancouver's Lower Mainland, the lone gunmen in Montreal, Mayerthorpe and elsewhere.</p>
<p>We shot into space a robot (Dextre), our first woman (Julie Payette) and a clown (Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberte), along with Dr. Robert Thirsk, who became the first Canadian to live on the International Space Station.</p>
<p>We saw the meteoric rise of self-described hockey nut Jim Balsillie of Ontario, whose Blackberries transformed the lives of millions of white-collar workers around the world. And with a great technological leap forward, the mass availability of Broadband wireless, we morphed seemingly overnight into a nation of bloggers, Twitterers, Facebookers and YouTubers.</p>
<p>In this decade, we lost Pierre Elliot Trudeau and watched the Liberal Party implode; and we saw the uniting of Canada's political right and the rise of Stephen Harper.</p>
<p>We survived SARS and H1N1 -- at least, so far.</p>
<p>But when it came to social issues, the true north strong and free made some profound decisions that will resonate for years.</p>
<p>We said yes to gay marriage, we said yes to legalized marijuana for medicinal purposes. We said we were sorry -- to victims of residential schools, to Chinese forced to pay a head tax to enter the country, to Indo-Canadians for denying some of them entry in 1914.</p>
<p>We saluted a Governor General who first came to this country as a Haitian refugee; we heralded the first female Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
<p>We said no to the Iraq war; we said yes to the UN Afghanistan mission, and we said goodbye -- time and heartbreaking time again -- to 134 soldiers killed there since 2002. A nation of peacekeepers, we remain divided on this issue. And look forward to the decade that lies ahead.</p>

<p>Liberals returning to power in Ottawa?</p>
<p>Political stability in Quebec?</p>
<p>A woman serving as a premier of a province?</p>
<p>These are all foreseen happening in the next decade by a large majority of respondents in a wide-ranging Angus Reid survey done for the Star and Montreal's La Presse.</p>
<p>The survey asked Canadians to rate the most important news event of the past decade, then asked Canadians, Americans and Britons to look ahead to the next decade.</p>
<p>The mission in Afghanistan topped the list of most newsworthy events in Canada this decade, cited by 29 per cent of respondents.</p>
<p>One in five picked two major health issues (the outbreak of SARS and the H1N1 flu), and 18 per cent cited the federal sponsorship scandal as the story of the decade. The Vancouver Olympics and the election of Stephen Harper ranked further down the list.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Canadians cited global warming as the biggest world issue in the coming decade, as did Britons. Americans overwhelmingly cited the economy as the decade's greatest global challenge.</p>
<p>Almost half of Ontarians (48 per cent) said life in this province is worse than it was 10 years ago. Three-quarters say Ontario's position in Canada has worsened over the past decade. Thirty-six per cent of Ontarians believe their standard of living will be better in 10 years.</p>
<p>Angus Reid surveyed 1,017 randomly selected Canadian adults in mid-December. Its findings have a margin of error of plus or minus 3.1 per cent. Its Ontario sample was 806 adults.</p>

<p>the street below the Ponzi-meister's Manhattan penthouse.</p>
<p>When the fraudster was sentenced in July to 150 years in prison, one of his many victims shared his Dante-esque views with the press: "May Satan grow a fourth mouth where Madoff can spend the rest of eternity."</p>
<p>Unheeded whistleblower Harry Markopolos gave us a clue as to why it took investigators so long to catch Madoff: "If you flew the entire Securities and Exchange Commission staff to Boston, sat them in Fenway Park, they wouldn't be able to find first base."</p>
<p>That was no help to the Queen, so during a visit to the London School of Economics this spring, she crisply asked why nobody had anticipated the recession. A three-page letter was duly dispatched to Buck House, explaining there had been a "failure of the collective imagination of many bright people who were guilty of wishful thinking combined with hubris."</p>
<p>But also greed. Don't forget the greed. Or skin and eye colour.</p>
<p>Brazil's President Luiz Lula blamed 2009's financial collapse on "the irrational behaviour of white people with blue eyes, who before the crisis appeared to know everything and now demonstrate they know nothing."</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Premier Dalton McGuinty told reporters this year to step back from his personal space when asking him questions. Five feet back. Who's got the cooties here - him or them?</p>
<p>After a slew of nymphettes blabbed to the press about her husband's Tigerish extracurricular activities, the wife of Italy's perma-tanned PM Silvio Berlusconi finally launched divorce proceedings, demanding $66 million a year (it's not cheap over there, you know). Then the Italian version of Rolling Stone awarded Berlusconi, 73, its Rock Star of the Year Award for "a lifestyle for which the words 'rock and roll' fall short."</p>
<p>"I am the most persecuted man in the entire history of the world," sniffed Silvio, shortly before someone gave him a bloody nose.</p>
<p>Bucolic Lincolnshire, England, reported a flurry of UFO sightings this summer involving a craft with long tentacles, which tore off the blade of a giant wind turbine. "I saw one coming from the fields, hovering 200 feet above me. I didn't want to go too near it as I was worried they might beam me up," said a shaken Eric Goring.</p>
<p>Nothing to it, Eric. Miyuki Hatoyama, wife of Japan's new Prime Minister, was abducted by aliens 20 years ago and returned to tell the tale. "My spirit flew on a triangular-shaped UFO to Venus," she recalled. "It was an extremely beautiful place and very green."</p>
<p>Her then-husband had dismissed the flight as just a dream, but "my current husband has a different way of thinking. He would surely say, 'Oh, that's great!'" You know, Miyuki, we're thinking he wouldn't.</p>
<p>Barack Obama's Jan. 20 inauguration speech may have fallen short on transcendent prose, but did contain a transcendent truth about the changed status of the U.S.: "Our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please."</p>
<p>It took a further month for the penny to drop, however, on another small matter: "We're not going to be able to rebuild Afghanistan into a Jeffersonian democracy."</p>
<p>No, again we're thinking not. Any more than Iraq has taken a step forward, going by Baghdad official Mazin al-Shihan's pre-Enlightenment plan to pay men to marry Iraqi war widows:</p>
<p>"If we give the money to the widows, they will spend it unwisely because they are uneducated and they don't know about budgeting," reasoned Mazin. "But if we find her a husband, there will be a person in charge of her and her children for the rest of their lives."</p>
<p>The incomparable Boris Johnson, mayor of London, shares hair of purest white with our own dear, about-to-be-ex city father, D. Miller, but has much loftier goals:</p>
<p>"At the moment I am like some underwater sea creature, a gigantic coelenterate, sucking everything in, and later on I am going to start expelling. It's going to take me some time to come up with a complete theory of urban civilization but I'm sure I will." So are we, not that it will be comprehensible, but never mind, we'll want to hear it.</p>
<p>This year, 34-year-old Wendy Brown of Wisconsin decided it would be a heckuva good idea to relive her childhood. So she pretended to be her own 15-year-old daughter, attended classes at a local high school and joined the cheerleading squad. When she didn't turn up one day, truant officers found Wendy locked up in the local jail on fraud charges, and proceeded to charge her with identity theft.</p>
<p>Reaction was mixed: "You just go, aw, all right, whatever," said articulate student Spencer Corpus.</p>
<p>"The entire staff of Ashwaubenon High should be drug tested for this completely inexcusable incident," huffed a letter to the editor of the local newspaper, which is probably in its last throes and now devoid of staff and hope and ... (er, sorry, that's another story).</p>
<p>Explaining to the New York Times why he gave up being a "public intellectual" to return home - or as the paper graciously put it, "Canada no less" - Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff took a load off our collective mind with, "I've been a spectator, and now I'm in the boat fishing. That part of it, from a spiritual point of view, feels good."</p>
<p>A London friend recalled strolling with Ignatieff "arm in arm around Covent Garden singing, poorly, of course, some of the great quintet in the first act of Cosi Fan Tutte." As one does. Later in the year, the spiritual, operatic, yet icily ambitious Ignatieff warned PM Stephen Harper, "If you mess with me, I'll mess with you until I'm done." Put that in the Times.</p>
<p>Speaking of Jeffersonian democracy, Venezuela's president of 10 years, the ever-gutsy if mostly bonkers Hugo Chavez won a referendum in February that lets him stay in power till the end of time. While he sang the national anthem at the victory celebration, the crowd chanted, or perhaps howled, "Hey ho, Chavez won't go."</p>
<p>People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals requested a South Dakota high school change its name from Spearfish High to Sea Kitten High. Since you ask, PETA's theory was that if students were taught to refer to fish as "sea kittens" - "individuals who have friendships" - fewer fish would be murdered. They didn't do it.</p>
<p>On the royal front: Prince Chulls is clearly a philistine, a quality which would not be a handicap in his line of work were it not for the presumption that prompts him to believe he is an expert on subjects about which he is ignorant - ex-British MP Roy Hattersley on HRH's interference in an ultra-modern housing development for which the royal family of Qatar was going to pony up.</p>
<p>And on the quasi-royal front: "My love life's diabolical," announced Fergiana, Duchess of York. "I don't want to sound desperate, but I'd like someone to come and join me on Planet Sarah."</p>
<p>Well, there's Eric in Lincolnshire, Miyuki in Japan, or Miss Universe, Dayana Mendoza, who may already be on it, going by her blog after visiting Guantanamo: "I didn't want to leave, it was such a relaxing place, so calm and beautiful."</p>
<p>Not to forget John Lydon, a.k.a. Johnny Rotten of the Sex Pistols. "For me, the best rock is not what you play," he noted, "it's what you're not playing." Which in his case is true.</p>
<p>Or Kanye West. After he barged on stage to interrupt wisplike singer Taylor Swift at the MTV video awards, Barack Obama joined the planet's sentient majority in calling him a "jackass."</p>
<p>Speaking of jackasses, Whoopi Goldberg didn't think it fair for Switzerland to arrest film director Roman Polanski for the drugging and rape of a 13-year-old girl 32 long years ago.</p>
<p>"It wasn't rape-rape," she idiotically observed.</p>
<p>In April, the unemployed, unwed Nadya Suleman, who'd given birth to octuplets three months earlier, trademarked the word "Octomum" in a bid to promote her career as a, uh, who knows? "We've had phone calls," said her lawyer, "but it's a stretch to call them offers."</p>
<p>Nothing is a stretch for Alberta. After a tourism video for the landlocked province showed a more-or-less azure sea and gold beach, premier's aide Tom Olsen explained there'd been "no attempt to mislead here. The picture used just fitted the mood and tone of what we were trying to do." Which was, let's face it, Tom, to mislead.</p>
<p>And where was the actual beach? Barbados, the Maldives, Pago Pago? Uh-uh. The village of Beadnell in Northumberland, England, population 528, one of whom, wouldn't you know, spotted the bizarre pretense and ratted.</p>
<p>Libya's increasingly unhinged Moammar Gadhafi droned on for 100 excruciating minutes at the UN General Assembly this fall. With a face like a wet weekend, Gadhafi ranged through the failings of the UN to who was behind JFK's assassination (Israel, natch) to his theory that swine flu was created for military purposes to the imminent arrival of "fish flu." He then promoted his website.</p>
<p>As his aides later explained, jet lag is a terrible thing. And so it is.</p>
<p>But so was 2009.</p>
<p>Time now to bow our heads, Harry, and thank <span class="companylink">Google</span> this one is done and dusted.</p>
<p>Will we miss the hurly-burly of it all? Like a hole in a parachute.</p>

<p>Most Endearing Underdog: Levi Johnston. She was a candidate for vice-president of the United States. He was a 19-year-old "redneck" whose claim to fame was the impregnation of her daughter. Yet Johnston managed to hold his own in a ceaselessly entertaining war of words with Sarah Palin - in between lucrative topless photo shoots.</p>
<p>Best Local Idea Gone Terribly Wrong: Ethnic food carts. Exorbitant start-up costs and bad locations made vendors wonder why they became vendors. Bad food made customers wonder why they didn't just buy hot dogs.</p>
<p>Most Successful Adulterer: Silvio Berlusconi. Tiger Woods has a bunch of affairs and has to leave his job: golfer. Berlusconi has a bunch of affairs and gets to keep his job: prime minister of Italy. Forget therapy and repentance - Tiger needs to take a study abroad trip to Rome.</p>
<p>Quickest Thinking by an Airplane Pilot: Chesley Sullenberger. After his Airbus A320 hit a flock of bids, <span class="companylink">U.S. Airways</span> Captain Sullenberger saved 155 people by effortlessly landing the plane in New York's Hudson River. That he is known as "Sully" made the story especially delightful.</p>
<p>Most Praiseworthy Acts of Defiance: Iran's Greens. They could have meekly accepted Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's fraudulent election victory; they could have responded with violence. Instead, tens of thousands of green-clad supporters of Mir Hossein Mousavi took to the streets in peaceful protest. We should all have their courage and restraint.</p>
<p>Most Entertaining Unsuccessful Attempt to Acquire a Phoenix Hockey Team and Move it to Hamilton: Jim Balsillie. The <span class="companylink">Research in Motion</span> billionaire lost his bitter battle with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman. Nonetheless, his outspokenness and tenacity turned an interminable and confusing saga into riveting theatre.</p>
<p>Worst Family Planning: Octomom. Though Nadya Suleman already had six children, she convinced a fertility doctor to implant six embryos. After two of them split, she gave birth to octuplets. Even her mother thought she was crazy.</p>
<p>Most Boneheaded Mistake: Saskatchewan Roughriders. The Roughriders had already begun celebrating their Grey Cup victory when they found out they had sent one too many players onto the field for the game's final play. Given another chance, Montreal made a field goal for the win. Ouch.</p>
<p>Best Reminding the World that Pirates Still Exist: Somali pirates. Who knew?</p>
<p>Most Deserved Deportation: Karlheinz Schreiber. In the words of one newspaper, the arms dealer/lobbyist/distributor of cash in envelopes to Brian Mulroney had "exhausted his legal options." He had also exhausted us. Good riddance, sir.</p>
<p>Most Deserved Failure By a Not-Funny Man: Jay Leno. He was always bad, but he was always successful. In his new 10 p.m. time slot, he was dreadful, and so, finally, were his ratings.</p>
<p>Least Satisfying Tale of Redemption: Alex Rodriguez. Long derided as a choker and a prima donna, the best-paid baseball player ever hit rock bottom with his February admission of steroid use. He then led his New York Yankees to a World Series title. It was hard to be happy for him.</p>
<p>Worst Preparation: North American public health officials. The H1N1 vaccine rollout was a mess in Canada, a disaster in the U.S. Governments are lucky the pandemic was so mild.</p>
<p>Most Needless Cosmetic Change by a News Program: The National. On the advice, apparently, of an American consulting firm, the CBC directed its newspeople to stand, CNN style, rather than sit at desks. Peter Mansbridge doesn't seem to like it; viewers certainly don't either.</p>

<p>great escapes</p>
<p>The greatest escape</p>
<p>Eight years after the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, killed 3,000 and sparked the war in Afghanistan, the man blamed for those deaths remains elusive, despite a massive manhunt. Occasionally rumoured to be dead and sometimes dismissed as irrelevant, Osama bin Laden sends a steady stream of messages that make a mockery of the $50-million price on his head.</p>
<p>“Emergency over water”</p>
<p>In what was dubbed the “Miracle on the Hudson,” Captain Chesley Sullenberger successfully ditched his <span class="companylink">U.S. Airways</span> flight on the New York river last January after both engines were knocked out by a flock of geese. All 155 people aboard survived.</p>
<p>Mad Max</p>
<p>Max Mosley, son of an infamous British fascist, faced outrage and calls to resign as president of Formula One racing's governing body after a tabloid reported last year that he took part in a Nazi-themed orgy. Irate, he sued and a judge found no evidence of Nazi intent and awarded him £60,000. Fade-away jumper</p>
<p>Kobe Bryant was a rising star with the L.A. Lakers in 2003 when he was accused of rape by a 19-year-old hotel employee. He was dropped by several sponsors (<span class="companylink">Nike</span> didn't even feature him when marketing his own shoe) but the charges were withdrawn, a civil settlement was reached and Mr. Bryant earned $45-million last year, according to Forbes.</p>
<p>Dog's best friend</p>
<p>People say they would do anything for a pet, but Ed Dyson means it. Last winter, the 72-year-old Labrador resident took a shovel to a polar bear mauling his miniature dog, Foot. Then the bear looked at him “very serious,” and Mr. Dyson knew he needed more. The bear fled after taking a round from his .22 rifle.</p>

<p>SCANDALS</p>
<p>hey, we tried</p>
<p>CANADA</p>
<p>l'affair Julie Bikers, lost documents and décolletage – this was our one taste of the salacious. Julie Couillard was a mystery woman in a low-cut dress when she turned heads at Rideau Hall in 2007, arriving on the arm of Maxime Bernier for his swearing-in as foreign affairs minister. Then the media learned of her Hells Angels connections, and he resigned after leaving confidential papers at her apartment.</p>
<p>SPONSORSHIP skulduggery The story of the fake invoices used to line the pockets of Quebec businessmen and Liberal organizers was infuriating, of course, but not exactly juicy.</p>
<p>mulroney's cash Brian Mulroney denied taking cash payments from lobbyist Karlheinz Schreiber until he finally told a public inquiry that he not only took the money but waited six years to report it to Revenue Canada. The fallout: The ex-PM is banned from contact with the government and his accuser has been shipped back to face jail time in Germany. THe rest of the world</p>
<p>AMERICA'S CHEATIN' HEARTS</p>
<p>Men in U.S. high office clearly didn't learn from Bill Clinton: New York Governor Eliot Spitzer resigned in 2008 for using a VIP prostitution service. Senator John Edwards admitted to an affair during his run for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination. Republican scandals featured social conservatives caught in gay trysts. Senator Larry Craig pled guilty to disorderly conduct in 2007 after propositioning an undercover officer in a men's airport washroom. Ted Haggard, the president of the National Association of Evangelicals, resigned in 2006 after admitting he solicited a male prostitute for sex and drugs.</p>
<p>ITALY'S SEXY SENIOR</p>
<p>Silvio Berlusconi is 73 but calls himself a “playboy” prime minister and courts controversy wherever he goes. His personal finances led to fraud charges and this year his philandering finally broke up his marriage. The decade has not ended well for Mr. Berlusconi, who was seriously injured and bloodied recently by a protester.</p>
<p>FRANCE'S NAKED AMBITION</p>
<p>Nicholas Sarkozy was elected French President in 2007 on a platform of controversial reform, but his flashy personal life overshadows his politics. Shortly after divorcing for the second time, he appeared shirtless on an Egyptian beach with his new girlfriend, singer and former model Carla Bruni. Within months they had married – even as she was appearing au naturel in GQ.</p>

<p>SCARES</p>
<p>false alarms</p>
<p>The Millennium bug</p>
<p>Did you stock up on canned goods? Gasoline? “I'm advising people to have three months of cash on hand,” one computer consultant tells The Globe. But the bug proves to be a bust.</p>
<p>The death of mail</p>
<p>As e-mail works its way into Canadian life, some see the end coming for Canada Post. Wrong. Last year, posties handled 11.6 billion pieces of mail – two billion more than 10 years earlier. Coalition rule</p>
<p>The opposition unites to topple Stephen Harper's government and replace him with Stéphane Dion. To buy time, the Prime Minister asks the Governor-General to “prorogue” Parliament. The term is new to many people, but the tactic works beautifully: The coalition disappears, followed soon by Mr. Dion.</p>
<p>Fidel's farewell</p>
<p>As the Cuban revolutionary's health deteriorates, the Western world is on alert. In 2007, celebrity blogger and Cuban-American Perez Hilton reports that Miami police are about to announce his death, and celebrations break out in the streets. Oops. Too soon.</p>
<p>Cheap oil</p>
<p>In early 2000, Alberta worries that its oil is too expensive. When the price hits $30 a barrel, the Canadian Energy Research Institute says it will be “relatively short-lived.” And it is – the figure goes as high as $147 before fading.</p>
<p>The global pandemic</p>
<p>Pick your poison. This decade has seen the West Nile Virus, avian flu and now H1N1, but no “global health disaster” – not yet, anyway.</p>
<p>Balloon Boy</p>
<p>But for one misstep, young Falcon Heene might still be in our hearts. First, he supposedly sails away in his father's test balloon. Then, he goes on Larry King Live and says “we did it for the show.” Junior stunt man.</p>

<p>If Canadians do one thing well, it's endearing awkwardness, especially on film. Take Brampton's Michael Cera, Montreal-born Jason Reitman and Haligonian Ellen Page, add sweatbands and</p>
<p>indie tunes. Wait for acclaim.</p>
<p>The Economist says so</p>
<p>Seriously: In September, 2003, the self-possessed Brit magazine put a moose with sunglasses on its cover and trumpeted “Canada's New Spirit.” Stodgy? On the contrary, it opined, “a cautious case can be made that Canada is now rather cool.”</p>

<p>Fascists: Europe's dirty secret.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>HARPER</p>
<p>top dog</p>
<p>If this decade belongs to anyone in Canadian politics, it is Stephen Harper, who returned from the wilderness to lead the dispirited remnants of conservatism to victory. It has been quite a ride.</p>
<p>Autumn, 2000: The new Canadian Alliance, led by Stockwell Day, fares miserably in a snap election. The Progressive Conservatives do even worse, and ex-Reform MP Stephen Harper retreats to a foxhole in Alberta. Conservatism is at its nadir.</p>
<p>Spring, 2002: Belay that. Conservatives have farther to fall. Alliance MPs rebel against Mr. Day He calls a leadership vote, and is whupped by Mr. Harper.</p>
<p>Autumn, 2003: Peter MacKay now leads the bankrupt PCs. Mr. Harper comes a-callin'. By the year's end, the Tories are united, and Paul Martin has finally forced out Jean Chrétien.</p>
<p>Spring, 2004: In trouble because of the sponsorship scandal in Quebec, Mr. Martin calls an inquiry and a vote he barely wins.</p>
<p>December, 2005: After much dithering, Mr. Martin calls another election, and loses.</p>
<p>Feb. 6, 2006: Mr. Harper is sworn in. He has a minority government, but the Liberals spend a year replacing Mr. Martin.</p>
<p>October, 2008: Voters give him another minority, but Mr. Harper gambles and cuts public funding to political parties, which would destroy the opposition.</p>
<p>December, 2008: Instead, the opposition almost destroys him with a coalition. The PM survives, barely, by suspending Parliament.</p>
<p>December, 2009: He fights the recession like a Keynesian and fights a non-existent crime wave by jailing people. He can afford to; Michael Ignatieff's political instincts are worse than Mr. Dion's. No one is taking this government down any time soon.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>9/11</p>
<p>how it changed the world</p>
<p>1 "AFPAK"</p>
<p>Seemingly vanquished the Taliban and al-Qaeda reconstituted in Pakistan's frontier lands. Their foes wonder if the war can ever be won when Taliban fighters cross borders freely while Western soldiers cannot.</p>
<p>2 THE COST OF IRAQ</p>
<p>Saddam Hussein was caugh, but with so much capital spent in Iraq, U.S. might and moral authority may never recover. Meanwhile, bombs continue to explode in Baghdad.</p>
<p>3 AIRPORT SECURITY</p>
<p>Every plane is still seen as a potential guided missile. Every passenger remains a danger - at least until through security. And secret "no-fly" lists show no signs of abating.</p>
<p>4 HOMEGROWNS</p>
<p>Who would have known hip-hop-quoting teenagers from the suburbs secretly harboured hopes of exploding truck bombs downtown? The case of the "Toronto 18" speakd to a global phenomenon: Terrorism can as grow at home as well.</p>
<p>5 THE "DARK SIDE"</p>
<p>The Bush Administrations's revelations left little to the imagination. Can Barrack Obama help the United States reclaim its moral clout and recover the rule of law?</p>
<p>6 GWOT</p>
<p>President Bush's "global war on terrorism" cuts both ways. More and more international terrorists are enlisting to fight "Jews and Crusaders" everywhere.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>DEMOGRAPHICS</p>
<p>Canada, you've changed</p>
<p>AGING The average life expectancy for Canadians has increased, cracking the 80 barrier in 2005 – 78 for men and 82.7 for women, and the gap is narrowing.</p>
<p>The median age, the point at which half the population is older and half younger, rose to 39.1 years in 2008, up from 37.2 in 2001. In 1972 it was 26.3.</p>
<p>diversity Since 2000 the population has grown about 1 per cent a year to 33.5 million, mostly because Canada has one of the highest immigration rates among wealthy nations.</p>
<p>From 2001 to 2006, the visible-minority population grew five times more rapidly than the population as a whole – 27.2 per cent compared with 5.4 per cent. Visible minorities now make up 16 per cent of Canadians, up from 13 per cent in 2001 (47 per cent in Toronto, 42 per cent in Vancouver).</p>
<p>Almost 60 per cent of new immigrants who arrived during the decade came from Asian nations, a trend that shows no sign of slowing and China is about to be surpassed by India as the top source country for Canadian immigrants.</p>
<p>divorce</p>
<p>In 2004 divorces fell below 70,000 for the first time since 1998 – a far cry from their 1987 peak of 96,200.</p>
<p>In 2004 the divorce rate was 21.8 per 10,000 people, compared with 36.4 in 1987.</p>
<p>pregnancy This was the decade when, for the first time, women in their 30s became the dominant age group of new mothers. Women between the ages of 30 and 34 led the way in 2005, just ahead of those between 25 and 29, part of a trend to starting families later in life. Just under half of those who gave birth that year, 48.9 per cent, were over 30.</p>
<p>the west booms Ontario's share of new immigrants plummeted from 58.7 per cent in 2000 to 47 per cent in 2007.</p>
<p>In 2000, Ontario gained 23,292 people from other provinces. By 2007 it had a net loss of 17,762.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan, whose population had been in decline, turned the trend around in 2007, adding 10,174 people,.</p>
<p>Alberta drew citizens from across Canada throughout the decade, with the biggest influx a whopping 58,166 recorded at the boom's peak in 2006.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>CHINA</p>
<p>rising star</p>
<p>Economic engine</p>
<p>A decade ago, the People's Republic had the sixth-largest economy. Billions of “made in China” labels later, it has joined the World Trade Organization (2001), more than tripled its gross domestic product and almost surpassed Japan as economy No. 2.</p>
<p>Deal maker In 2001, after the United States was attacked, no country could stop it from lashing out in Afghanistan and Iraq. That was then. While America made war, and spent trillions it didn't have, Beijing accumulated U.S. treasury bills and expanded its influence to end the unipolar world.</p>
<p>Political model</p>
<p>Ten years ago, opening the economy and the advent of the Internet were seen as the end for authoritarian regimes. Things have changed. Instead of crumbling, the Communist Party has charted a course – largely free markets under one-party rule – that others (notably Vladimir Putin in Russia) are studying.</p>
<p>Web wrangler</p>
<p>The Internet was supposed to challenge the regime, but China now has the world's largest online community (more than 300 million users), and the government makes sure the conversation never includes: “Hey, are these really the leaders we want?”</p>
<p>Climate chameleon</p>
<p>Two years ago, China passed the United States to become the world's largest carbon-dioxide emitter, and the country's leadership has refused to commit to firm emissions caps. But there's a green lining to its black clouds: China is becoming a world leader in solar and wind power.</p>
<p>Language instructor</p>
<p>It's probably time to start learning Mandarin, or at least suggest it instead of Spanish for your kids. The trend has already started. The government claims that 40 million foreigners are taking lessons. Ni hao ma?</p>

<p>Brother Bonhomme In a move befitting Canada's most labour-friendly province, Bonhomme Carnaval unionizes.</p>
<p>Fromage perdu Entrepreneur Luc Boivin drops a ton of cheddar deep into the Saguenay River, hoping the pressure and the chill will give Quebeckers a new gourmet treat. If only divers could find it again.</p>

</p>
<p>When David Miller reflects on 2009, he must wish he could erase 39 days in June and July.</p>
<p>The Great Strike of '09 overshadowed everything else that happened at City Hall this year, demolishing the mayor's approval ratings and cementing his decision not to seek a third term.</p>
<p>In the public's eye, Mr. Miller was undone by, of all things, a decade's-old sick bank benefit. The obscure perk became a metaphor for unaffordable public-sector benefits in a time of economic crisis. Torontonians were livid when it appeared Mr. Miller had caved on his vow to eliminate the benefit, settling instead for phasing it out over time.</p>
<p>Yet what most Torontonians don't realize is that months before the strike, Mr. Miller and the city's negotiators had aimed to phase out, not scrap, the sick bank. In the end, the mayor got exactly what he wanted on the issue – on top of an arguably good wage deal that will cut the city's 2010-2012 payroll by $42.4-million compared to the previous contract.</p>
<p>So how did David Miller lose for winning?</p>
<p>His summer from hell is a story of love lost with the unions that swept him to power, of the steep political price of containing costs, and of one big gamble that paid off at the bargaining table but cost him dearly at the kitchen table.</p>
<p>It is also a cautionary tale for the people who want his job.</p>
<p>Prepping for hard bargain</p>
<p>In the summer of 2008, with the global economy on a precipice, Bruce Anderson sat at the helm of the City of Toronto's human-resources division. He joined the city in 2007 after six years with Simon Fraser University.</p>
<p>As lead negotiator, he was working on a plan to modernize the city's aging civil service. His officials also knew they faced a financial crisis heading into talks with 23,000 employees whose contracts expired Dec. 31, 2008. The city's net liabilities had ballooned to $2.84-billion, driven by infrastructure debt and employee benefits.</p>
<p>The new human-resources boss impressed his masters with his research skills. But Mr. Anderson (who declined to be interviewed) was also versed in the art of fending off elected officials. As one put it, “He's one of those guys who can look at you blankly and talk in dense paragraphs that leave you with a headache.”</p>
<p>In September, a week after <span class="companylink">Lehman Brothers</span> collapsed, Mr. Miller's executive committee met to consider the city's books. In an otherwise grim assessment, there was a glimmer of good news. Since 2006, the sick-bank liability had fallen 4.7 per cent due to council's decision to discontinue the benefit for non-unionized employees. If the city could do the same for its much larger unionized work force, it could save much more.</p>
<p>Originally conceived as an incentive to fight absenteeism in a bygone era, the sick bank allowed workers to save 18 sick days a year and cash them out for as much as six-months pay when they retired.</p>
<p>Between September, 2008, and April, 2009, Mr. Anderson obtained secret approval from council's employee and labour-relations committee to press ahead with a strategy to eliminate the sick bank during negotiations with Canadian Unions of Public Employees 416 and 79, representing Toronto's outside and inside workers.</p>
<p>His goal was to replace the sick bank with the same short-term disability-leave plan granted to the city's non-unionized employees. Under that scheme, common in the private sector, ill or temporarily disabled workers receive most or all of their pay while they're laid up.</p>
<p>To get there, council's employee and labour-relations committee, chaired by the mayor, had to sign off on bargaining “goals” for Mr. Anderson's negotiating team.</p>
<p>The committee gave Mr. Anderson a mandate to cut a deal to “grandfather” the sick bank, meaning it would no longer be available to new hires, although existing employees could continue accumulating days.</p>
<p>Some months later, the committee allowed Mr. Anderson the option of offering employees a buyout package if they relinquished future sick-bank benefits.</p>
<p>Committee member Doug Holyday, a right-of-centre councillor, had long promoted the buyout approach from his days as mayor of Etobicoke. Mr. Miller consulted Mr. Holyday to ensure he'd help sell the plan to other councillors.</p>
<p>By May, Mr. Anderson had a mandate to negotiate the phase-out. But he wanted to drive a hard bargain before making any compromises.</p>
<p>Unions refuse to budge</p>
<p>In early June of this year, the 416 bargaining team – representing 6,200 outside workers – set up a war room in the Canadiana Suite of the Delta Toronto East hotel in Scarborough. The windowless space was equipped with a fridge, a microwave, a bank of printers and Internet access. A table by one wall was heaped with coffee, candy and chips.</p>
<p>Local 79, representing 16,000 inside workers and led by veteran president Ann Dembinski, established its own headquarters in a similar hall at the Sheraton Centre. (She declined an interview request.) For months, the contract talks had been stalled as CUPE negotiators balked at the 118 pages of concessions Mr. Anderson presented as the city's opening position, a wish list that included the elimination of the sick bank.</p>
<p>Back in February, Mr. Miller had met 416's new president, Mark Ferguson, for a chat. A calm, self-possessed paramedic, Mr. Ferguson had been a member of the 416 executive since 2002, when the union was forging a relationship with Mr. Miller as he prepared to run for mayor.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller stressed the city's money problems and the recession, warning Mr. Ferguson he didn't want a settlement imposed by Queen's Park, as happened in 2002. Arbitrated deals tend to favour unions because arbitrators are not obligated to consider the employer's financial circumstances.</p>
<p>“I had an established track record of being supportive of our workers and [felt] we should be able to negotiate a rational collective agreement,” Mr. Miller says. In June, the mayor and city officials began to talk publicly about eliminating the sick bank. Many voters, hurt by the recession, were shocked to learn about what they saw as an unaffordable benefit.</p>
<p>What Mr. Miller and his officials didn't reveal, for tactical reasons, was that the city was prepared to grandfather the sick bank and compensate the employees.</p>
<p>As the June 22 strike deadline approached, each side waited for the other to yield. In 2005, Mr. Miller had averted a strike at the 11th hour with a promise to allow CUPE to deliver some outsourced services.</p>
<p>This time, he chose to stay out of the talks.</p>
<p>On deadline day, CUPE 416 negotiators waited for hours at the Delta East for the city's offer to arrive. Mr. Anderson, however, opted not to offer up that package of pre-approved sick-bank compromises.</p>
<p>The city, in short, rolled the dice. But CUPE wasn't making empty threats. Soon after midnight, Mr. Ferguson delivered the union response to Mr. Anderson: “You've just bought yourself a strike.”</p>
<p>Miller's big gamble</p>
<p>As soon as the strike started, city officials rolled out a carefully planned strategy for handling residential garbage.</p>
<p>Still, residents fumed about reeking local dumps and long lines at transfer stations. Thousands of children had been shut out of recreation programs, and parents scrambled to find daycare.</p>
<p>An Angus Reid poll showed most Torontonians wanted the city to scrap the sick bank and ask the province for back-to-work legislation. The poll showed residents were almost equally upset with both the mayor and the unions.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller seemed worn down. At a gathering at Councillor Kyle Rae's condo after the Gay Pride parade, he looked haggard, one guest recalls, “You could just see it on his face – exhaustion and frustration. This was killing him.”</p>
<p>Progressive councillors, some with close ties to CUPE, grew antsy. Twice, the left-leaning group gathered for private strategy sessions at Councillor Joe Mihevc's St. Clair West home. “A common thread we were all hearing is, ‘Anderson's the problem, you've got to bring in someone else to close,' ” recounts one participant. “This [was] so much the fog of war.”</p>
<p>Two weeks in, the mayor's office began talking to Mr. Anderson about changing the strike's dynamic. They decided to ante up one of those secret compromises – the buyout option – as part of a new formal offer. But there would be a tactical twist: They'd go over the heads of the CUPE negotiators by going public, posting the offer on the city website, along with a calculator to help employees estimate their payout.</p>
<p>The offer included hard numbers: a four-year contract with a total wage hike of 7.2 per cent; a short-term disability plan guaranteeing sick workers 75 to 100 per cent of their pay for up to six months; and an offer to partially buy out employees' accumulated sick banks, with an average payout of $8,500 for those with more than 10 years.</p>
<p>But it included no mention of the approved middle way: grandfathering the sick bank.</p>
<p>In the Canadiana room, CUPE negotiators tried to figure out their next move. By then, the summer's infestation of fruit flies had reached the snack table along the wall. Calls and e-mails flew back and forth to Ms. Dembinski's team. Mr. Ferguson felt the gambit had only entrenched the membership. Both locals publicly denounced the move. But with thousands of hits flooding the city's website, Mr. Miller and Mr. Anderson figured the bait had worked.</p>
<p>Yet to residents unfamiliar with the complex nature of contract talks, the offer began to smell like weakening resolve. “Some of this may well have been the choreography of collective negotiations,” notes Ryerson University political scientist Myer Siemiatycki. “But it did box Miller in.”</p>
<p>‘Only Nixon could go to China'</p>
<p>As July wound down, Mr. Miller knew that a looming H1N1 outbreak could trigger back-to-work legislation for striking public-health nurses. With a provincial arbitrator pressing both sides, Mr. Anderson's team dropped their concession demands, paving the way for bargaining over the sick bank and wages.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferguson's team responded with a counter-offer: grandfathering the sick bank. But CUPE informed Mr. Anderson that his group had until midnight on July 26 to ink a deal or face a moratorium on further talks.</p>
<p>The grandfathering proposal was the gesture Mr. Anderson had been waiting for. Without knowing the city's secret mandates, CUPE's position finally coincided with the goal negotiators established months earlier. Late into the night of July 27, the two sides struck a deal, with Mr. Miller learning the details from his High Park home. The strike was over.</p>
<p>Over the following days, pundits, conservative councillors and irate residents – all unaware of the city's internal bargaining strategy – attacked Mr. Miller for caving.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson sketched out the game plan during the council ratification vote on July 30. CUPE negotiators were flabbergasted by his revelations. But few residents noticed: Their criticisms had hardened into received wisdom.</p>
<p>For many on a cash-strapped council, the story looked quite different. Councillor Pam McConnell, a member of the employee and labour relations committee, received congratulatory calls from other Ontario mayors. The conservative Mr. Holyday also felt the city got a good deal. The reduced sick-bank liability – a $140-million reduction – put the city on firmer ground.</p>
<p>Mr. Ferguson also says the union got a reasonable agreement, but he's still seething about the tortured process to get there. “If that was the mandate, why didn't they come to the table and bargain the mandate they had?” he asks.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson is not telling. One point, however, is clear; and even Mark Ferguson acknowledges it – In collective bargaining, you never open with your bottom line.</p>
<p>When David Miller embarked on these negotiations, he wanted to modernize the city's relationship with its unions to insulate the civil service from privatization.</p>
<p>He still maintains it was the right thing to do. “I don't accept the criticism of my handling of the strike,” Mr. Miller says. “We didn't attack the unions, and we achieved our bargaining goals.”</p>
<p>With a 6-per-cent total wage hike over three years, the city's contract is certainly frugal compared to other public service contracts. “Only Nixon could go to China,” quips an insider, who describes Miller as “an inconvenient enemy.”</p>
<p>Still, the strike polarized the city's relationship with its unions, tarnished Mr. Miller's otherwise strong record, and set the stage for an election that may feature a raucous debate on outsourcing garbage collection.</p>
<p>For a progressive who launched his own mayoral campaign on the eve of a shorter but much more chaotic garbage strike, the irony must be difficult to ignore.</p>

</p>
<p>11A poet I may not be, but with the big day past, it only takes a few words to recognize what people are doing this morning. The traffic says it all. Manitobans are more interested in getting to their nearest shopping centre for bargains, than booking the fastest route out of town.</p>
<p>But tomorrow we begin to get back to normal.</p>
<p>For those of us who are not leaving this week, the questions are still about all-inclusive holidays and sun destinations.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Years ago, tour companies would regularly drop off vacationers to Manzanillo and Ixtapa as they passed over these cities en route to Acapulco. Now even though these same planes pass over all three of these cities en route to Huatulco, they refuse to land to let passengers off. Why is that?</p>
<p>ANSWER: We definitely could use more sun destination options, but there are two sides to this form of solution for new destination options.</p>
<p>Manitobans don't take well to the roundabout flights that are not completely non-stop.</p>
<p>For quite some time tour operators have used an extra stop strategy for many of the flights to the Dominican Republic. They go to both Punta Cana and Puerto Plata on one flight pattern. By going with the same circuitous route, passengers only have to endure one stop, either on the way out or on the way home.</p>
<p>Many do not like making this delay, even though it is relatively short, preferring to book the direct flights only. Frustration often occurs if the entire plane is asked to get off the aircraft and wait in a small holding area.</p>
<p>The challenge is that Manitoba does not seem able to fill planes on a weekly basis to smaller destinations, so it becomes a major obstacle for the tour operators.</p>
<p>However, all being said, it is time at least one more of our biggest tour companies take the leadership to create more destination options, and then give it the time to build a solid booking pattern.</p>
<p>QUESTION: You took your recent golf trip to Florida in November when it was still very warm. Is January too cool to plan a golf holiday to the Miami area?</p>
<p>ANSWER: I have spent time in Florida in virtually every month of the winter season. I did have to buy heavier wear while visiting Orlando one January a number of years ago.</p>
<p>Every season can bring a surprise, especially to the orange industry which has faced frost more than once over the last three decades.</p>
<p>However, I found the weather to really be quite excellent for the most part in January, particularly as you move south down to Miami. For the golfer especially, if the temperatures only reach 19-21 degrees Celsius, it's still very comfortable golf weather. The records for temperatures in Miami indicate the daily averages for January are 19.5 C with the average highs being 23.5C.</p>
<p>As reported, we stayed in two resorts in the immediate Miami area. The Fairmont Turnberry Isle was one of the more spectacular properties I have found in a while, with plenty to do for the entire family on site and nearby.</p>
<p>The vision of Phil Mickelson hoisting the cup after winning last year's World Championship, as we stood on the 18th green of Doral's famous Blue Monster course were both memory makers.</p>
<p>Certainly any risk you might face from weather can be avoided a couple of weeks later but I would not personally think twice about a January Miami vacation.</p>
<p>The service is also excellent. The area receives thousands of Canadian visitors each winter. They appreciate our business but they also are willing to express a fondness for most Canadians.</p>
<p>QUESTION: Do you need to get the H1N1 vaccine before you are able to get into Mexico? I heard that they ask you at the airport in Mexico if you have your documentation for the H1N1 vaccine, if not, they don't allow you in? Is that accurate?</p>
<p>ANSWER: At this point there is no country other than Saudi Arabia that is demanding that you report whether or not you have actually had the H1N1 vaccination. wNeither do I anticipate that that is likely to happen this winter.</p>
<p>Canada likely has a greater percentage of its population which has taken the vaccination than most countries, including most of the regions we are likely to contemplate visiting this season.</p>
<p>There are some countries, as has been pointed out in previous columns, who have instituted body heat screening mechanisms to help identify those wishing to pass through customs even though they are ill.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you have had the vaccination, there is no harm in ensuring you have the card with you that you were given upon vaccination.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 threatens systems</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>If making people sick weren't enough, the H1N1 virus risks claiming another victim: the corporate computer network.</p>
<p>If the swine flu pandemic becomes severe enough, businesses might have to ask a big chunk of their staff to work from home -- as much as 60 per cent, according to some projections. But very few companies are prepared to handle that level of telecommuting.</p>
<p>"Companies are very much in react mode when it comes to pandemic preparedness," said Paul Sexton, a consultant at <span class="companylink">IBM Canada</span>'s Business Continuity and Resiliency Services.</p>
<p>According to research firm IDC, only one-fifth of companies have a tested pandemic plan in place.</p>
<p>While many companies' systems can handle a 15 per cent level of telecommuting through remote connections, few have the capacity for a larger contingent. A sudden spike in external access can bring unprepared systems to a halt.</p>
<p>Communications and data security can also be a major headache in the event of a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>A business operating with high absenteeism still has to be reachable for customers and partners. Companies with call centres are especially vulnerable if agents have to work from home, and it's hard to implement a sophisticated call-routing system during a crisis.</p>
<p>Even if calls are properly routed, problems can extend to the home if there's no proper planning.</p>
<p>If a house has only one landline, families might start fighting over who gets to use it, Sexton said.</p>
<p>And it doesn't end there, warned Justin Folkerts, a security analyst at Fusepoint Managed Services in Toronto.</p>
<p>"Is there enough storage on the phone voicemail system to handle inboxes filling up over two weeks?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Do workers have the ability to access e-mail and check their voicemail from home?</p>
<p>"These are the gaps we see as problematic."</p>
<p>The first step any company should take in drafting a pandemic plan, analysts agree, is identify which systems are critical to operations.</p>
<p>Then make sure there's always someone who can manage those systems, either on-site or remotely.</p>

<p>And the news image of 2009 is . . . The Close-up Needle Jab!</p>
<p>Close runner-ups include Michael Jackson, Tiger Woods and Balloon Boy. But it was the nightly needle that dominated this year's newscasts.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, is all that H1N1 arm-stabbing over yet? Can I watch the TV news again without having to wince at the hundredth poke?</p>
<p>I realize a tight close-up of an arm getting vaccinated is grabby. But there's something excessive -- not to mention distracting -- about showing 10 or 12 injections in a brief news segment.</p>
<p>In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if needle-averse people were so unnerved by those continual close-ups, they actually passed on getting the shot.</p>
<p>The needle fixation makes me think of various other fads and fetishes that have become popular with news broadcasters.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the new standing shtick on CBC's The National -- picked up, apparently, from American entertainment and news shows.</p>
<p>In a sense, I suppose, standing signals immediacy. But mainly it distracts. Inevitably, the viewer pays more attention to the newscasters' clothes sense and posture than to the story being told.</p>
<p>I feel for them, as they try to decide how to stand -- casual or formal? -- and how to hold their news script, like a rectangle fig leaf covering their privates or, awkwardly, at waist height. Practically anyone would prefer a chair behind a desk.</p>
<p>And what's with the light show? The National ought to kill those gliding, blinking background visuals they recently introduced. They half-mezmerize as they flow and change, non-stop, from right to left.</p>
<p>Another news trend that's got to go is the mystery-voice technique -- that protracted voice-over you hear while you're looking at, say, a building or a back alley. A few seconds is fine. But often, you hear a voice talking about the story, and for maybe 10 seconds you have no idea who the person is. It's as if the building or the back alley is doing the talking.</p>
<p>It's hard enough to pick up words recorded in less-than-ideal conditions. Seeing the person speak them often helps.</p>
<p>The showing of video footage is often overdone anyway. If a reporter or the anchor is talking about a sawmill or a hospital, we really don't need to see endless visuals. We know what they look like. Or if footage must be shown, how about a split-screen?</p>
<p>If a story is complex or involved, it should be presented in a way that people watching will be able to get it, even if that means showing charts or maps or printing out certain names, places and quotations.</p>
<p>At the end of too many stories -- especially intricate, international ones -- you think: What was that all about? From time to time, news teams ought to have focus groups watch selected reports, then ask them to relate what they just heard. The result would probably be humbling, if not hilarious.</p>
<p>Some newscast practices are just plain irksome. For example, why run "streeter" interviews of citizens who prove to have no view on the matter at hand? Or zoom-ins that unflatteringly focus on the subject's skin pores or nose hairs? Or cheesy theme music or "swoosh" sound-effects interjected mid-broadcast?</p>
<p>And during the Christmas season, do we really need a nightly story on whether people have finished their shopping or not? Or what retail sales might be after the figures are tallied? The point is, no one knows yet. It's pure speculation.</p>
<p>Perhaps the oddest trend among the newsies -- especially on the national broadcasts -- is the ordering of the stories. Stories of highest consequence always used to lead, with others following in descending importance.</p>
<p>These days, lesser stories often open newscasts. Recently, for example, one of the national networks led with a three- or four-minute story on the World Cup soccer draw. A story on the fact that Russia says it may now help the West to impose sanctions on Iran -- jaw-dropping information with enormous implications -- was given a two-sentence reference about three-quarters through the program.</p>
<p>The story of another Canadian Olympic skier being injured is discouraging. But it oughtn't take precedence over, for example, more in-depth analysis of the complex interraction between the House of Commons and the Senate which could, we're now told, lead to another prorogation of Parliament.</p>
<p>But I digress.</p>
<p>Let the 2010 images begin.</p>

<p>What? Huh? December again, already? Time to take stock and sum up, you say? Well, somebody's got to do it, so I sat down with the tools of my trade.</p>
<p>While cutting the lime into wedges, I gave 2009 the mental once-over: Recession. Afghanistan. Swine flu. Bernie Madoff. The Michael Jackson industry. Iran. The climate change issue. Olympic marketing overkill. The coalition government fuss. The New York Yankees winning the World Series. Michael Ignatieff. Tiger Woody. Ugh.</p>
<p>2009 is surely the Year of the Vampire. The lifeless undead were ubiquitous this year, first in teen fiction, then in teen movies, teen TV, everywhere. True Blood, The Vampire Diaries, Twilight, etc., etc.</p>
<p>Why are we obsessed with vampires? Sociologists droned on about anxiety in the culture. Novelist Anne Rice calls vampirism "a powerful metaphor for the outcast and monster in all of us."</p>
<p>VAMPIRES WERE NOT, HOWEVER, THE ONLY ABSURD THING ABOUT '09. HERE ARE SOME OF MY OTHER FAVOURITES:</p>
<p>- Those wacky Belgians: Belgium's national bodybuilding championships were cancelled after government anti-doping inspectors showed up - and all 20 competitors ran away. They should have expected some testing: last year three-quarters of competitors tested positive for steroids and other bad stuff.</p>
<p>- Tweet of the year: Singer Lily Allen: "People say I'm egocentric. But enough about them."</p>
<p>- Toughest review of the year: Deborah Ross in The Spectator mag: "There really isn't a lot to say about Lesbian Vampire Killers apart from this: don't go anywhere near it. Just don't see it. Do something else instead. Do anything else instead. Catch up with your ironing ... at 87 minutes, it's probably a good 87 minutes too long."</p>
<p>- What could possibly go wrong?: Solange Magnano, Miss Argentina of 1994, died from complications after buttock-enhancement therapy. She was 38.</p>
<p>- Wedding of the year: In Suvereto, near Livorno in Italy, a bride and groom had arranged for the bride's bouquet to be tossed to the bridesmaids and single female guests from a small plane. But the flowers somehow got sucked into the engine and the plane caught fire, exploded, and plunged into a hostel, Corriere della Sera reported. One person was badly hurt.</p>
<p>- You can see she's got a future in politics: Paula Abdul, when asked about a report that Simon Cowell had asked her out on a date, answered this way: "There's some truth to that, and no truth to it."</p>
<p>- Politician of the year: If you crossed Hugh Hefner with Mackenzie King, you'd have Italy's Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, still in office after a year of scandals involving prostitutes, strippers, models, his quasi-secret hideaway Villa Certosa, etc., etc. I say nothing of his financial scandals.</p>
<p>At one point before she left him, his wife Veronica Lario spoke up to denounce the old goat's habit of appointing showgirls to be his party's candidates for the European Parliament. She also mocked him for turning up at the 18th birthday party of a blond model whose parents he knows: "It really surprised me, given that he never went to the 18th birthday parties of his own children."</p>
<p>- "Men are pigs" dept.: Mel Gibson, Jon Gosselin, David Letterman, Ronnie Wood, Gordon Ramsay, John Edwards, Mark Sanford, Eddie Cibrian and, of course, Tiger Woods.</p>
<p>My favourite is Sanford, governor of South Carolina, who was supposedly "hiking the Appalachian trail," when in fact he was in South America with a mistress. All over South Carolina, guys in bars started getting slapped in the face just for inviting girls to go hiking.</p>
<p>Oh, man, no more space? I was just getting started. But I suppose there's a limit to how awful a year can be. I hope so, anyway, because from here it looks like 2010 will have all the same old problems, plus who can say what new ones?</p>
<p>Oh well. Happy New Year, folks!</p>

<p>In a year of recession, our strongest currency was language. And over the next few weeks, North America's eminent lexicographers, grammarians and linguists will decide which word accrued the most social value of all.</p>
<p>From aporkalypse to Dracula sneeze, Botax to balloon boy, the buzzwords of 2009 hold a mirror not only to what shaped the headlines but also to the breakneck speed at which we saw language evolve. On Jan. 8, members and friends of the American Dialect Society will review the top coinages and, in what's become the lexical equivalent of the Oscars, bestow the distinction of Word of the Year.</p>
<p>"This isn't some government-appointed august body of intellectuals gathering in a room to officially induct words into English," says Grant Barrett, chairman of the ADS's New Words Committee. "It's a room full of rabble. And at the heart of it, the main purpose is to highlight changes in language."</p>
<p>Among Barrett's 2009 nominations are: "aporkalypse," describing worldwide hand-wringing and panic over swine flu; "I'mma let you finish," a meme spurred by Kanye West's interruption of Taylor Swift's acceptance speech at an awards show; "Dracula sneeze," the playful shorthand for sneezing into the crook of one's arm; and "Great Recession," widely used to describe economic downturn.</p>
<p>Other words with lex appeal, and nominated by fellow language experts, include: "Botax," a proposed levy that would be charged on cosmetic procedures to help pay for U.S. health care reform; "sext," a sexually explicit message or photo sent by mobile phone; "balloon boy," used to describe a six-year-old boy whose parents claimed he floated away in a homemade balloon; and "app," a once-niche abbreviation made mainstream, primarily, by ubiquitous iPhone ads.</p>
<p>"What makes these words so appealing is that they do define this particular moment in time," says Nancy Friedman, a name developer at California-based Wordworking and contributor to this year's nomination pool.</p>
<p>"But very few survive. The ones that carry over aren't the ones that pop out; they're the more pedestrian words that don't draw a lot of attention."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Google</span>, for example, was never flashy enough to become an ADS Word of the Year but is a frontrunner for Word of the Decade because of its stickiness, utility and enduring cultural significance. Y2K, by contrast, easily won 1999's top honour but has all but vanished from pop parlance since.</p>
<p>Explains Barrett: "The faster a word spreads, the faster a word dies. The best language is unobtrusive."</p>
<p>Although language is always on the move, Canadian word watchdog Mark Abley remarks that the past two decades have seen the most dramatic rate of development.</p>
<p>"These (word of the year) exercises have become a kind of quasi-official recognition that the English language is evolving at amazing, even alarming speed," says Abley, the Montreal-based author of The Prodigal Tongue: Dispatches from the Future of English.</p>
<p>"By designating a particular word or phrase as emblematic of 2009, we highlight some event or person that mattered to lots of us in the past year. But we also do something more: we highlight the process of language change itself."</p>
<p>Previous winners of the ADS's Word of the Year include bailout (2008), truthiness (2005), metrosexual (2003), weapons of mass destruction (2002), 9-11 (2001), soccer mom (1996), information superhighway (1993) and Not! (1992).</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alcohol blood test seems out of wack</b>
</div><div>R.H. Eves   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>282 words</div><div>26 December 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>It was stated that the level of alcohol in a person's blood is found by blowing 50 milligrams, a weight value, per 100 millimetres, a distance value. What that has to do with the quantity of alcohol in a person's blood remains a mystery to me.</p>
<p>It should be a percentage of either a volume measurement to another volume measurement or a weight measurement to another weight measurement. In other words, if you had a container which contained one cubic inch of blood and you drained one-quarter of that amount of blood and replaced it with the same amount of alcohol, the alcohol content of the new mixture would be 25 per cent or .25 of the original.</p>
<p>What that instrument is saying makes about as much sense as saying there are three ounces of alcohol per foot. This would certainly leave the accuracy of this Alcotest 7410 GLC gadget in doubt, would it not?</p>
<p>The question of sanitation also has to be considered. This instrument apparently has to be completely placed in the driver's mouth. Does the driver of the vehicle do that? Or, does the officer do it? There certainly should be some kind of sanitation procedure carried out, should there not?</p>
<p>With all the gadgets around today, like cellphones, GPS units, calculators, etc., could there not be a personal portable type of detector developed for private use? Or, maybe a coin-operated one located in various public places, like bars, clubs, etc., where alcohol is served, and with sanitation procedures required, particularly, with the H1N1 epidemic.</p>

</p>
<p>More than 500 years ago, European explorers sailed into the dark and temperamental ocean, embracing uncertainty in the hopes of turning the unknown into the known. Modern-day explorers took their quest to the endless bounds of outer space, again championing the uncharted despite the perils that might lay ahead.</p>
<p>But since the fall of the Twin Towers nearly a decade ago, and arguably a short while before, uncertainty began making people anxious, not excited. That day, it became clear that faraway people are capable of unleashing devastation on the New World. Suddenly, America -- and the West by association -- was vulnerable.</p>
<p>Follow that with Hurricane Katrina, SARS, Avian Flu, the threat of climate change and, most recently, H1N1 influenza, and we have witnessed an era increasingly marked by fear, preparation and more preparation.</p>
<p>"When you regard the future with such dread, uncertainty is no longer something that can be managed in a relaxed way," said Frank Furedi, professor of sociology at the University of Kent and author of Politics of Fear, Where Have All the Intellectuals Gone? "If people feel vulnerable, then even the slightest challenge to their existence will be traumatic. And so we tend to dramatize the unexpected, and work hard to accident-proof ourselves."</p>
<p>Today, there is a multibillion-dollar industry devoted to accident-proofing and risk mitigation. Universities have launched masters programs in Business Continuity Planning and in Disaster and Emergency Management. Non-profit organizations such as Canada's nationwide Disaster Recovery Information Exchange have grown, and more and more people are flocking to gatherings like the World Conference on Disaster Management, held in Toronto earlier this month.</p>
<p>"The biggest change I've seen in the last 10 years is an increased awareness and acceptance at a more senior level within business," said Ralph Dunham, managing director of business continuity practice for Marsh Risk Consulting. "They've been faced with managing higher levels of risk, more governance demands from shareholders and more regulatory demands by the government."</p>
<p>In fact, on April 10, 2006, in the midst of growing concern over an Avian Flu pandemic, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions Canada sent a letter to all federally regulated financial institutions that said: "OSFI expects financial institutions to review their business continuity plans and consider the adequacy of those plans for dealing with a potential pandemic."</p>
<p>Three years later, governments and businesses have turned their attention to a possible H1N1 pandemic, which the World Health Organization framed as a threat to human existence and which governments deemed a threat to national security.</p>
<p>But the H1N1 pandemic did not strike as expected, and Mr. Dunham worried that another non-event -- in the vein of Y2K -- might dissuade businesses from crafting solid emergency preparedness plans.</p>
<p>"I feared that H1N1 might bring pandemic fatigue, that people might say the Chicken Littles of the world took our money," he said. "But companies seem committed to improving on the plans they scrambled together."</p>
<p>Prof. Furedi said this commitment stems from fear not only of the known and likely, but also the unknown and unlikely.</p>
<p>At a press briefing in February 2002, former U.S. defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld described the notion of "unknown unknowns," pointing to those threats that authorities have not yet fathomed and for which, therefore, they cannot prepare.</p>
<p>But Prof. Furedi said the notion of the "unknown unknown" was first channelled by environmentalists who warned years ago that, all things constant, oceans will someday swallow the Earth. Prof. Furedi argues this mentality has likewise gripped today's mothers and fathers, creating a generation of paranoid parents who obsess over their children's safety and buy gadgets to track their whereabouts.</p>
<p>"Once you assume that what's most dangerous is not what you know, but what you don't know, then the argument is that we must act now," he said.</p>
<p>In a sense, the probability of an event today matters less than the possibility of an event. For Lee Clarke, a professor of sociology at Rutgers University and author of Mission Improbable, this emphasis on possibilities offers a reasonable way to talk about extreme events.</p>
<p>"Purchasing life insurance is an insane bet, but we do it anyway -- from a probabilistic point of view, it's irrational," he said. "This is an example that, in some circumstances, it's worthwhile to make choices on the basis of possibilities because the consequences could be huge."</p>
<p>Prof. Clarke said preparedness is largely about the "what if," and the "what if" has grown ever louder over the years.</p>
<p>"We've moved to dangerous places, we concentrate ourselves and therefore make ourselves big targets, and we rely on technology," he said. "These are the kinds of hazards or risks that were simply impossible a hundred years ago."</p>
<p>But Prof. Furedi said today's propensity for preparedness is less pegged to past catastrophes, and instead born from a slow and steady cultural shift.</p>
<p>"From the 1980s onwards, the paradigm of the resilient human being gave way to the paradigm of the vulnerable human being," he said, pointing to what he considered a devaluation of masculinity as an example. "The stiff upper-lip gave way to showing your feelings."</p>
<p>With this, he argues, came a re-definition of humanity as highly vulnerable, a description governments today use to identify at-risk groups when speaking about pandemics, climate change and terrorism. "Included in that list of vulnerables are children, elderly, ethnic minorities and women, which essentially adds up to 110% of the population," he said. "The latest spin is 'The Vulnerable.' By putting 'The' in front of 'Vulnerable,' you equate the term with a person's identity."</p>
<p>This rise in existential insecurity opened the doors for what Prof. Furedi calls "fear entrepreneurs" -- those who prey on people's insecurities. Fear, he said, has become a resource, compelling the fearful to prepare for anything and everything, regardless of probabilities or cost.</p>
<p>But perhaps that is for the better, Prof. Clarke said: "When it comes to preparing for things that don't end up happening, we should all be so lucky."</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>THE FEAR INDEX</p>
<p>PANDEMIC SAFETY</p>
<p>Montreal-based <span class="companylink">Noveko International Inc</span>. said this month it would significantly increase its operations from the 10 million masks it produces monthly to meet demand for 150 million masks worldwide. It also planned to increase production of hand sanitizer from 200,000 litres a month to 500,000. Americans bought US$130-million of hand sanitizer gel in the past year, up about 29% compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p>MILITARY MIGHT</p>
<p>According to a Top 10 ranking of the best performing industries in the past decade, tank and armoured vehicle manufacturing grew 244% between 2000 and 2009.</p>
<p>THE FUTURE</p>
<p>It appears children are also affected by societal concerns. A 2009 survey of 500 U.S. children between the ages of 6 to 11 found that one-third fear Earth won't exist when they grow up.</p>
<p>FOOD SAFETY</p>
<p>California's Novato Fire Protection District posted a statement on its <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page in Oct. 2009 advising people to "limit the handling of food items from 'community' containers such as cookie and candy jars."</p>
<p>BAD GOODS</p>
<p>The number of product recalls in the United States per year has grown nearly 85% since 1990.</p>
<p>There have been 301 product recalls issued by Health Canada in 2009. One hundred of those are for children's products. In 1999, Heath Canada issued a total of two product recalls, both children's gear.</p>
<p>DOWN ON THE GROUND</p>
<p>2,100 Number of people who attended the World Conference on Disaster Management in 2009</p>
<p>MONEY SENSE</p>
<p>US$100-billion Dollars spent worldwide preparing for Y2K</p>
<p>THE AIR UP THERE</p>
<p>2,340 Number of lobbyists working on climate change in the U.S. -- an increase of 300% in five years</p>
<p>CHILD SAFETY</p>
<p>Sales of a special tracking bracelet for children in Japan tripled in the past decade to US$212-million.</p>
<p>EDUCATION</p>
<p>As of October 2009, there were 173 Emergency Management programs offered at U.S. colleges and universities, and another 67 relating to homeland security and terrorism education.</p>
<p>In 2001, Manitoba's Brandon University began offering Applied Disaster and Emergency Studies degrees. Over 60 students at the school of 3,000 declared ADES as their major in 2005.</p>

<p>It was during the last summer of the Second Millennium, as the universe vibrated with excitement and nervous expectation, that a New Yorker named David Samuels finally made up his mind. He would offer himself in marriage to the lovely Samantha Bilker as the centuries flipped, and he would tell everyone about his plan ... except Sam.</p>
<p>Mr. Samuels, a successful 32-year-old dot-com venture incubator -- remember them? -- called The New York Times and purchased a tiny advertisement to be placed at the bottom of Page One on Day One of the infant epoch. The ad was to read: "David M. Samuels and Samantha H. Bilker Announce Their Engagement 01/01/00 ADVT."</p>
<p>Mr. Samuels paid in advance. Then he booked a pair of plane tickets to Central America to ride out the end of the world with the woman he loved.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Who could know what was to come? It was the anxious eve of Y2K, when brokers selling the snake oil of Armageddon convinced many of us that, at the stroke of midnight on Dec. 31, computer systems would fail to recognize the correct date, the world financial system would crumble, and planes would fall from the sky.</p>
<p>In New York City, they were right on two out of three. It would take nearly nine years for the monetary meltdown to occur, but only six hundred and seventy-nine days -- until the 11th of September, 2001 --for hell to drop from the air.</p>
<p>On New Year's Eve, 1999, none of us could reckon that. We were gathered in our giddy millions in Times Square, exuberant, expectant, and, given the warnings of impending chaos, strangely calm. I remember filing my lead to the National Post that day: "We were casting out the century of Auschwitz and Apollo in the self-appointed centre of the world ..."</p>
<p>And at midnight, standing just outside T.G.I. Fridays at the corner of Broadway and 46th Street, as the screams of the multitudes filled the air and confetti snowed down from the skyscrapers, I kissed my sister full on the lips and then -- having leapt across centuries, still alive, still whole -- I started to cry.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>David M. Samuels's little advertisement appears on the front page of the copy of The New York Times, now mounted and framed, that I bought just after midnight on 01/01/00. Above it were headlines that included "Computers Prevail in First Hours of '00" and "Yeltsin Resigns; Putin Takes Over." And there was another tiny notice at the bottom of the front page: "Be a noisemaker in the new millennium! Register your growing business with bizzed.com.ADVT." The ad didn't disclose it, but Bizzed.comwas an Internet tentacle of Citibank, intended to leverage its parent's "reputation and clout to create partnerships with many different online and offline firms." Well, it didn't. By January 2001, Money magazine was writing that "Citibank's Bizzed.commight as well as have been cryogenically frozen for the last year." Last winter, millions of suckers (including me) got clouted as Citi stock fell from US$40 a share to US$3. And, as 2010 dawns, UrbanDictionary.comdefines "bizzed" as "A feeling of frustration or anger often after an extreme insultation or verbal twatting." ---</p>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I went back to Times Square to try to recapture that magical midnight and to talk to people about the tumultuous decade that followed.</p>
<p>From the lights and the din and the craziness, you never would have guessed that it wasn't New Year's Eve. There had to be a hundred thousand people on Broadway, gawking and hawking and absorbing the rays of radium that penetrate, just from being in New York.</p>
<p>In fact, the crystal-blue ball whose measured descent heralds each new year already was up in place, and behind it was a gigantic poster of a $100 bill and the cryptic message: "I'll Be Back."</p>
<p>I took this as a sign that the Great Recession was over and sidled up to a man named M-----, a son of a former French colony, who was selling tickets for a bus tour of Manhattan. So were about a dozen other immigrant vendors who laughed and nodded as M-----summed up New York and the Third Millennium this way:</p>
<p>"Every day, you are waiting for tomorrow, but you can never touch it. They say, 'If you can make it here, you can make it anywhere,' but you can't make it here. Here, you kill yourself on the street to make your dream. You have your home, you have your car, and you pay for them all your life.</p>
<p>"To have that dream here, you have to say, 'My old country is garbage.' It's like you could spend your money on your wife, nice clothes, send her to gym, make herself beautiful, but instead you spend on another woman. America is the other woman. Your country is your wife."</p>
<p>M-----wasn't in the square on New Year's Eve, 1999, and he won't be there this year, either. Every year, at two o'clock in the afternoon, he leaves for a church in Brooklyn and remains there in prayer. Who knows? Perhaps it was his devotions that got us through Y2K.</p>
<p>"How are you doing in the recession?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Worse worse worse worse worse," M-----said.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Outside T.G.I. Friday's this time was a man named Patrick, who had bought a fistful of tickets to a comedy club and who now was trying to sell them at a profit. This was fully legal; it was how dozens of people make their living every night in Times Square.</p>
<p>"Who wants to see a comedy show?" Patrick called out, with limited enthusiasm.</p>
<p>He was a computer expert, recently laid off by <span class="companylink">Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu</span>, which was the thanks he got for helping the company not get stung by the Millennium Bug, in '99.</p>
<p>"The economy hit everybody," he said. "The department I was in, a lot of people got thrown into the cold."</p>
<p>I asked him where he was</p>
<p>on 9/11.</p>
<p>"Across the street," he said. "I saw them come down."</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>So there were reminders of a decade of tragedy and horror.</p>
<p>On March 6, 2008, a "large man" in a hooded grey sweatshirt riding a bicycle through Times Square dropped a box containing an improvised explosive device outside the U.S. Armed Forces Recruiting Center just below the New Year's crystal ball. Now, I walked down to look at the famous little building and, on its southern wall, found a bronze plaque that listed all the New York-born winners of the Congressional Medal of Honor, which is America's Victoria Cross.</p>
<p>Listed under "Global War on Terror" were two names:</p>
<p>Corporal Joseph L. Dunham USMC and Lieutenant Michael P. Murphy USN.</p>
<p>Later, I learned:</p>
<p>On April 14, 2004, three days after Easter Sunday, Cpl. Dunham was manning a checkpoint in Karabilah, Iraq, when an insurgent leapt from his car and began choking Cpl. Dunham. A scuffle ensued as two Marines approached to help. Suddenly, the insurgent dropped a grenade. Cpl. Dunham took off his Kevlar helmet, dropped to the ground and covered the explosive as best he could. The blast seriously wounded all three Marines. Eight days later, Cpl. Jason L. Dunham died at Bethesda Naval Hospital from wounds he received in the incident. He was 22.</p>
<p>And:</p>
<p>While continuing to be fired upon, Lt. Murphy made contact with the SOF Quick Reaction Force at Bagram Air Base and requested assistance. He calmly provided his unit's location and the size of the enemy force while requesting immediate support for his team. At one point he was shot in the back causing him to drop the transmitter. Lt. Murphy picked it back up, completed the call and continued firing at the enemy who was closing in. Severely wounded, Lt. Murphy returned to his cover position with his men and continued the battle.</p>
<p>These were two young men who would not see Y2K plus 10 next weekend, while the rest of us drank and cheered.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>David M. Samuels and Rebecca H. Bilker were married on Nov. 25, 2000. They had waited out Y2K in Belize, which would have been a palatable place to be stranded, had everything gone haywire. David did propose on New Year's Eve, much to Sam's surprise, and dozens of their friends and relatives did learn the news from the miniscule advertisement on Page One of The New York Times.</p>
<p>Then the dot-com lunacy exploded -- "it was all smoke and mirrors" -- and David M. Samuels went from being, in his words, "the richest guy Sam knew to the poorest guy Sam knew."</p>
<p>He is telling me this at six in the morning in the office of the spotless Esposito's Finest Quality Sausage factory on West 38th Street, a short walk from Times Square. Mr. Samuels has been the proprietor of the firm since 2002, and if the presence of a not-especially-kosher-keeping Jew at the helm of a traditional Italian salsicceria strikes you as odd, well, remember, this is New York.</p>
<p>As representatives of the first decade of the 21st century, David and Samantha Samuels are perhaps typical: they were not killed on 9/11, they did not fight and die in the sands of Asia or win the Medal of Honor, they were not in the Big Easy during Hurricane Katrina, and the tsunami of 2004 didn't reach Westchester County, N.Y.</p>
<p>Yet they, like most of us, were brushed by calamity and preserved by chance. On Sept. 11, 2001, David was working in a building a few steps from the Twin Towers; he got off his bus to see papers whirling in the air and saw the second jet hit. His father, semi-retired, didn't come into his office in the World Trade Center that day. Samantha was uptown, working for a ladies' pajama company. There but for fortune.</p>
<p>A "cousin's best friend's younger brother" perished in Iraq. The sausage business suffered somewhat from the fears of the ignorant that swine flu can be contracted by eating swine, but margins have remained good and he hasn't had to lay off a single worker. Samantha helped him with the business and delivered children named Harry, Skyler and Casey.</p>
<p>"That would make the decade by itself," David says.</p>
<p>Like me, he keeps the front page of The Times framed on a wall, the better to remember that starry, star-crossed crossing of the centuries.</p>
<p>"I guess it sums up the state of the world," he says. "Not everyone is treated the same. Countless families were shattered by 9/11, soldiers lost in war, bankruptcies, lost jobs, lost homes. The world is not an equal or fair place."</p>
<p>"If anybody asked me about any specific event," Samantha says, "of course it was tragic. It was terrible. But except for losing tons of money that I never really had in reality, only had on paper, nothing happened."</p>
<p>"We are very lucky people," I suggest.</p>
<p>"Yes," says David M. Samuels. "It's been a great decade."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Seasonal flu or needle boost H1N1 shot efficacy; Research on ferrets suggests one flu vaccine may prime effectiveness of other</b>
</div><div>TOM SPEARS    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>522 words</div><div>24 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Having a seasonal flu shot, or even a case of ordinary flu, appears to "prime" an H1N1 vaccination and make it more effective, new research from Italy shows.</p>
<p>The results are a surprise, because seasonal flu shots alone give no protection against H1N1.</p>
<p>But the finding provides evidence that a seasonal flu shot would be especially useful for children, or for people with weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>The study from <span class="companylink">Novartis</span>, a major vaccine maker, is based on ferrets, not humans. Ferrets catch flu in a way that's closer to humans than any other animals.</p>
<p>A research team in the Italian city of Siena knew that vaccines were being rushed into production while many questions about H1N1 were still unanswered.</p>
<p>"Combating an ongoing epidemic is an inexact science," they write in today's issue of Science Translational Medicine, a research journal.</p>
<p>"Little is known about how previous seasonal flu vaccination affects H1N1 vaccines.</p>
<p>"Under extreme time pressure, public health officials have made their best guesses about the appropriate H1N1 vaccine formula and dosage to speed up manufacturing."</p>
<p>The experiment found that ferrets given a seasonal flu shot, followed several weeks later by an H1N1 shot, mounted a much more efficient immune response when exposed to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"The seasonal vaccine by itself provides no protection against H1N1," study author Rino Rappuoli wrote in an email to Canwest News Service. "It only primes the immune system for a faster and better response to an H1N1 vaccine."</p>
<p>The ferrets with two flu shots created a greater number of antibodies to flu. This "higher concentration of antibodies ... corresponded directly to increased protection from H1N1 infection," the team reports.</p>
<p>Many Canadians have had two shots, but in the reverse order - H1N1 first. (A still-unpublished study from British Columbia suggested people who had the seasonal flu shot were more likely to get H1N1.)</p>
<p>Rappuoli said this should not be a problem.</p>
<p>"In the case of Canada, it is not important when they receive the seasonal vaccine in 2009, because people have already been primed by the vaccine of 2008 or by an influenza infection earlier in their life," he wrote in his email.</p>
<p>Earl Brown, a University of Ottawa virologist and flu researcher, said it's even possible that having a seasonal flu shot after the H1N1 shot might boost H1N1 resistance.</p>
<p>"The main point of this is that the similarity (between flu strains) is close enough that immunity to one can enhance immunity to the other," he said.</p>
<p>Both the seasonal and swine flus are in the H1 group of viruses, he noted.</p>
<p>The scientists in Siena said they don't know why the seasonal flu shot acts as a booster when it provides no protection on its own. They also said the next study needs to be done in humans.</p>
<p>If it works in humans, it could help people with weakened immune systems, who might not get enough protection from an H1N1 shot alone.</p>

</div><div>Jamie Komarnicki   </div>
<div>For the Calgary Herald</div>
<div>461 words</div><div>24 December 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Three Calgary H1N1 vaccination clinics are scheduled to reopen for at least six days in the new year as public health officials continue the push to immunize as many Albertans as possible.</p>
<p>Roughly 500,000 people in the Calgary region have been inoculated against the pandemic virus since the mass clinics opened in late October, said Dr. Judy MacDonald, deputy medical officer of health in Calgary.</p>
<p>The remaining public clinics in the city closed for the holidays on Wednesday.</p>
<p>MacDonald said Alberta Health Services officials decided to resume the service from Jan. 4 to Jan. 9 because of the continued level of interest in getting the vaccine.</p>
<p>After the first week, health officials will assess whether to extend the clinics' hours.</p>
<p>"We will have to take a look at what the demand is that week when we resume our mass clinics on Jan. 4," MacDonald said on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine has been distributed to hundreds of family physicians and specially trained pharmacists in Alberta to give out the shots.</p>
<p>Further, the vaccine has been available to third-party providers since early December.</p>
<p>Private organizations can contract their services to get the shot.</p>
<p>One of those providers, the Victorian Order of Nurses, has given H1N1 shots to about 400 companies this month, said spokeswoman Kathy Cormier. The shots cost about $13 an injection, she said.</p>
<p>"They're literally small companies to big ones. It just has to do with whether there's an interest in putting together a contract for setting it up," said Cormier, noting the group will provide the service "until there's no longer any interest."</p>
<p>Public health officials, meanwhile, say even though a second wave of the virus has waned, it's still important to get vaccinated to ward off yet another spike in cases.</p>
<p>Higher travel volumes around the holiday season can spread the virus -- another reason to get the shot, MacDonald said.</p>
<p>"With all the travel that happens over the holiday season, that may lead us to a third wave sooner than we might expect," she noted.</p>
<p>So far, H1N1 has been linked to the deaths of 65 Albertans.</p>
<p>The three clinics that will reopen Jan. 4 are: Avenida Village, Brentwood Village Mall and Whitehorn EMS Station.</p>
<p>Their hours of operation are noon to 7 p.m., Monday to Thursday; and 8:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., Friday and Saturday.</p>

to get vaccinated.

</p>
<p>Mass influenza vaccination clinics will close for the holidays beginning today and reopen in January with some changes.</p>
<p>"We're tailoring the campaign to the public need," said Noreen Remtulla, a spokeswoman for Alberta Health Services. "The times and locations will vary around Alberta, based on their demand in their community."</p>
<p>The clinic in Millbourne Mall at 38th Avenue and Millwoods Road will reopen Jan. 4 and will run Mondays and Tuesdays. The clinic at Westmount Mall will be closed and replaced with one at the East Edmonton Health Centre, 910 112th Ave. It will operate Wednesdays and Thursdays, beginning Jan. 6.</p>
<p>Both clinics will be open from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. On Saturdays, they will both be open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Communities in the surrounding area, including Strathcona County, Fort Saskatchewan, St. Albert, Spruce Grove and Stony Plain, will continue to offer appointment-only shots at their local health centres.</p>
<p>Remtulla added that pharmacies and doctors now have the vaccine available. So if families want to be immunized for H1N1 over the holidays, they can give their local pharmacies and doctors a call for their availability. Those going for the vaccination should bring a piece of identification and their health card, and wear short sleeves if possible.</p>
<p>Alberta has been shipped more than 2.2 million doses of vaccine, but only one-third of the population has been immunized. Another 344,000 doses are being stored for the province and would be shipped immediately upon request, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>

<p>On Oct. 26, my husband was admitted to the University Hospital in severe condition from the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>He had no predisposition nor underlying circumstances that would have given us concern that he would have been hit so hard by the flu virus. He spent more than six weeks in ICU.</p>
<p>On Dec. 11, David moved out of ICU to a regular ward, where he continues to recover from the damage inflicted by the virus to his body.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the doctors, nurses and support staff for the excellent care that David has received during this ordeal and for the support given to our family.</p>
<p>There were times when the doctors told us to pray for the best, but prepare for the worst. The doctors warned us that if David survived this attack, he would be spending months in the hospital in recovery.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the excellent care of hospital staff and David's determination, it appears that David maybe home for Christmas or before the New Year.</p>
<p>Truly, it is our Christmas Miracle.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pens put hurtin' on Sens; Ottawa captain Daniel Alfredsson leaves game after taking a hart hit; goalie Pascal Leclaire skates into an ambush in his return from injury. Penguins 8, Senators 2</b>
</div><div>James Gordon   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>1150 words</div><div>24 December 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>On a night when the Ottawa Senators were supposed to be celebrating the return of No. 1 goalie Pascal Leclaire, and energy wingers Chris Neil and Shean Donovan from injury, they found themselves coping with another potentially devastating loss.</p>
<p>Captain and leading scorer Daniel Alfredsson left and didn't return after taking a hard hit in the first period of a thoroughly embarrassing 8-2 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins. As Alfredsson dragged himself straight to the dressing room, Milan Michalek doled out some immediate payback by jumping Pittsburgh right-winger Craig Adams.</p>
<p>That set the tone for a long, sad, scrappy night for the Senators. If the players weren't pushing and shoving, it meant the Penguins were probably scoring a goal.</p>
<p>A team spokesman said Alfredsson suffered a shoulder injury and coach Cory Clouston said after the game, "It doesn't look good."</p>
<p>Ottawa's captain had his arm in a sling after the game and said he would likely be out for at least a few weeks.</p>
<p>"I'll probably see the doctor (today) and get an X-ray, and see what the damage is, but I expect at least a few weeks," Alfredsson said.</p>
<p>He said he hadn't watched the hit delivered by Adams, but acknowledged he was in a vulnerable position reaching for the puck.</p>
<p>As for Leclaire, it seems absurd to suggest he was strong in his first game back after an errant puck flew into the bench and broke his cheekbone a month ago, but that was the case.</p>
<p>Of the six goals he gave up over two periods of work, precisely none were his fault. The defensive breakdowns were so atrocious, the Senators could have started a four-by-six slab of titanium and still allowed a few goals.</p>
<p>Brian Elliott came in for mop-up duty in the third, allowing two more.</p>
<p>"Those (games) happen once or twice a year and they're not fun, but all you can do is try and forget about it," Leclaire said.</p>
<p>Prior to the game, Penguins coach Dan Bylsma laid out his strategy against the returning Leclaire.</p>
<p>"Two approaches you can take," he said. "You can fire no shots at him for the first 20 (minutes) and put him in a situation where he doesn't get any work when he probably wants to feel the puck.</p>
<p>"We're not going to take that one."</p>
<p>No, they didn't.</p>
<p>Leclaire had to make about four or five highlight stops in the first 10 minutes and Ottawa was lucky to escape the first period tied 1-1. The dam broke in the second, when Bill Guerin (twice), Ruslan Fedotenko, Chris Kunitz and Evgeni Malkin scored.</p>
<p>The line of Malkin, Kunitz and Guerin toyed with the Senators, totalling 12 points.</p>
<p>"You can't blame (Leclaire) for the situation we were in going into the third period," Clouston said. "I thought we had four or five unbelievable chances in the first period, we didn's score on them and it just seemed to snowball from there. We collapsed partway through the second and just couldn't recover."</p>
<p>After Malkin completed his hat trick in the third period, fans littered the ice with headwear as the loudspeakers boomed, "Let it Snow."</p>
<p>Anton Volchenkov and Chris Kelly scored for Ottawa.</p>
<p>With the contest all but over, the Senators were left to do what most teams do when they're getting annihilated: They started yapping and throwing punches.</p>
<p>Chris Neil challenged and defeated Mike Rupp early in the third, and Matt Carkner came together briefly with Adams less than a minute later. Shean Donovan, whose knee was injured on a hit by Penguins agitator Matt Cooke the last time the two teams met, tried to exact revenge, but didn't get a response. Cooke skated away and the referees skated in to assess Donovan a minor for unsportsmanlike conduct and 10-minute misconduct.</p>
<p>It was an ugly game all around and it set the stage for a difficult new year.</p>
<p>The Senators face the prospect of starting 2010 with Alfredsson and centre Jason Spezza, who is out until after the Olympic break with a knee injury, and two others expected to help lead the offence are mired in slumps. Michalek has one goal in 12 games, while Alex Kovalev has three goals in the past 16, all on the same night.</p>
<p>Forget the latest gadgets. They're probably hoping Santa brings back their scoring touches. So much for a merry Christmas.</p>

<p>HHHHHIIIII</p>
<p>The Game</p>
<p>Bah! Humbug! Despite the return of starting goalie Pascal Leclaire, and the crash and bang of Chris Neil and Shean Donovan in time for Christmas, the Sens took one on the chin, proving that payback really is a word that rhymes with witch. Not only did the Penguins avenge the 6-2 pasting they took in Ottawa last month, they managed to paste the Senators' best player, Daniel Alfredsson, right out of the lineup.</p>
<p>Cheers</p>
<p>Bill Guerin, Penguins</p>
<p>One for the ages, or aged. Acquired last year to help keep an eye on the kids at playoff time, he's showing them a thing or two offensively at 39. Two goals and two assists Wednesday leave him behind only Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin in team scoring.</p>
<p>Jeers</p>
<p>Craig Adams, Penguins</p>
<p>There's a new Grinch this Christmas in Ottawa after Adams put Alfredsson out of the game with a shoulder injury late in the first after a controversial hit.</p>
<p>It's About Time</p>
<p>After all of the griping about the referees making like Scrooge to the Sens, a hooking call on Mike Rupp early gave them their first of six power plays on the night. Not that it mattered. Ottawa went O-fer.</p>
<p>Head Hunting?</p>
<p>The head-shot debate will be on again following Adams' crunch on Alfie. Correctly, no penalty was called, but there's no denying Adams was going for the knockout blow.</p>
<p>Did You Believe ...</p>
<p>... the apple Jordan Staal served up on Ruslan Fedotenko's goal. A no-look drop to the trailer. Sick, and not in the H1N1 way.</p>

</p>
<p>You're hosting cocktails for 100 of your nearest and dearest in a week's time. What do you say to the 75 who still haven't bothered to open the Evite?</p>
<p>You overhear a party guest announcing he's recovering from swine flu -and he's standing under the mistletoe. Do you have to pucker up?</p>
<p>You're newly unemployed and your best pal gives you a Goyard bag whose price tag approximates a car payment. How should you break it to her that you won't be reciprocating?</p>
<p>Every holiday season brings its own set of etiquette challenges, and this year is no different. Electronic correspondence, whether through <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Evite, e-mail, Twitter or text message, has created the need for a new set of social skills. So has the economy, as people try to navigate the annual traditions of gifting and tipping while budgets are being squeezed.</p>
<p>And if that isn't enough to dampen spirits, there's the H1N1 virus, which has made the mini Purell hand sanitizer the holiday season's must-have accessory.</p>
<p>After having your parking space stolen out from under you at the mall, and being tackled for the last Zhu Zhu pet, it would be easy to think the holidays bring out the Grinch in people. But etiquette experts say that's not always true.</p>
<p>"When we're holding up the airport security line because we're on the phone telling people we are running late, we're at our worst because we are not aware of the people around us. We're stressed, rushed or running around trying to multi-task," said Anna Post, author and spokeswoman for the Emily Post Institute in Burlington, Vt. "But when we celebrate with our friends and family, we are at our best because we know we are supposed to bring our A-game."</p>
<p>That starts with sending a polite invitation. For all but very formal occasions (weddings), electronic invitations are acceptable, but experts disagree on the delivery system.</p>
<p>Fashion publicist-turned-etiquette enthusiast Cooper Ray, whose website Social Primer specializes in men's manners, considers communications that originate at Evite cheap and those from Paperless Post chic. (Both websites allow users to design electronic invitations that are sent via e-mail.) "I also send out a lot of e-mail invitations from my personal account," he said.</p>
<p>Thomas P. Farley, creator of the website What Manners Most and a columnist for Pingg who lives in New York, disagrees. "E-mail is the lazy way out. If you can't take the trouble to log on to a website and create something with flair that gathers all the tools together that you and your guests will need, then maybe you don't have the time to throw a party."</p>
<p>Whatever form the invitation comes in, it's a guest's responsibility to reply as soon as possible.</p>
<p>"You hate to say no, to be a downer, and you think you should hold off until you're sure," Farley said. "But you should treat any electronic invite like you would a paper one and respond right away. You can tick the box that says 'maybe,' which at least gives the host a sense that you got the invite, that it didn't go to the wrong address."</p>
<p>Guests should know that many online invitation sites have features that allow a host to see who has opened an invitation-- and how many times. So don't be a party peeping Tom, lurking in cyberspace until the guest list is up to your standards. And once you've made a commitment to attend, keep it.</p>
<p>"Not to show up," Ray said," is a slap in the face."</p>
<p>If you can't make it, don't feel as if you have to explain in detail why. (Does anyone really want to hear about your hernia problems?)</p>
<p>"There is a whole thing in the Evite world of people one-upping with their declines," Post said. (I can't make it because I'll be rock climbing in Yosemite or adopting a baby in Malawi, that kind of thing.) "You can just say you're sorry and explain offline."</p>
<p>Guests are not required to take anything to a party, but it's a lovely gesture, Post said. "Some people bring a sweet item, a box of chocolates or a bottle of wine if you know your hosts drink," she said. (Ray recommends inexpensive sparkling wine.)</p>
<p>"Flowers in a vase are also nice, so your host or hostess doesn't have to interrupt party prep. Or, a cute trend I saw at the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas that could be applied to a holiday party is breakfast bread -- for your host to eat the next morning," Post said.</p>
<p>Once the party is in full swirl, palms are being pressed and cheeks kissed, don't immediately try to banish the biohazards; wait to pull out the Purell until you are in private.</p>
<p>And if a guest seems to be under the influence of swine and not wine? "A host should be kind and direct," Post said. "Something like, 'Sarah, you don't look so well. Maybe we should hang out another time.' "</p>
<p>Guests shouldn't be conversation hogs, and they should know when and how to leave. "When you arrive, make sure you make a beeline for the host to say hello. And when you leave, just go," Ray said. "I can't stand people who come up to the host at a rocking party and say, 'We're sooooo sorry we have to leave,' because the implication is how will this party go on without us? Don't disrupt the flow."</p>
<p>The morning after, Post recommends guests match their thank-yous to the invitation. "If you were invited on Evite, post a thank-you on the host's <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> page. If they called you, call them back. And it's never wrong to send a written note."</p>
<p>Jacqueline Whitmore, a Palm Beach, Fla.-based author, etiquette coach and the founder of www.etiquetteexpert.com,encourages[http://www.etiquetteexpert.com,encourages] handwritten thankyous during the holidays, particularly if someone has had you over for dinner or given you a gift or a gift card. "E-mail is too impersonal for this time of year," she said.</p>
<p>And sometimes a handwritten note is gift enough, she says. In other words, you need to forget about parity when it comes to gift giving, particularly in this lean year. That all-expenses-paid Disneyland trip from Grandma, or the Louis Vuitton wallet from Big Sis -- accept them graciously and don't worry about reciprocating to the last cent.</p>
<p>"The gift was given in love; you should accept it with love, grace and thanks," Whitmore said. "If you want to reciprocate, do what you can do. Don't go overboard and get yourself into a deeper financial hole. You can give the gift of your time, a gift of food, a gift of volunteering. You don't have to go to the mall and buy another tchotchke."</p>
<p>Conversely, if you are the lavish gift giver, understand that circumstances for friends and family may have changed. "I'm a big believer in giving freely with no expectation in return," Ray said. "You could say something like, 'I thought of you when I saw this, and I know this has been a tough year, so please know that for me your presence is present enough.' "</p>
<p>Other people might want to reevaluate their gift-giving habits altogether. Secret Santa versus white elephant gift exchange? Best to start with a frank conversation.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't diminish anyone's dignity," Farley said. "I would just say, 'We're all watching our budgets this year. We've known each other long enough, our friendship can sustain a year without gift giving.' "</p>
<p>Post agrees. "This is a time to be direct and clear." If you have a sister who has been laid off, you might offer to change up your gift exchange.</p>
<p>"Present it to her since she's the one with the new situation. She may say she's been saving up, and it could be a point of pride. Or she may say, 'Thank goodness you said something; let's cook dinner together instead.'</p>
<p>"When budgets get trimmed, you can't pull money out of thin air," Post said. "If someone expects a gift, and they might be offended if they don't get one, it might be worth telling them that with the economy, you're going to have to skip gifts this season. Find another way to let them know you value them."</p>
<p>"It's going to be different this year," Whitmore said. "We all have to be sensitive and realize that not everybody is in the same boat."</p>

a gathering shouldn't hog the conversation. It's important to greet
the host when you arrive, and don't disrupt the flow by interrupting
when it's time to leave -- just go.

<p>MANITOBA Health is investigating after a child suffering from H1N1 was found to be resistant to antiviral treatment.</p>
<p>The child -- identified only as under the age of 18 with an underlying medical condition -- did not need to be hospitalized, Manitoba Health reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>The provincial government is investigating because this is the first time a Manitoban has shown resistance to Tamiflu, which is used to treat those with H1N1.</p>
<p>It's the eighth such case in Canada, and other cases are being reported around the world.</p>
<p>It "appears this is an isolated case," with no evidence to suggest that a resistant strain of H1N1 flu has emerged, the government said.</p>
<p>The provincial government is not recommending any changes to its clinical-care guidelines.</p>
<p>This case was found as part of routine testing of influenza specimens for antiviral resistance at the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab.</p>
<p>Antiviral resistance can occur when there is a shift or mutation of the flu virus into a resistant strain.</p>
<p>It can also result when people don't finish their prescribed medication or don't follow the directions for their use; or when prolonged treatment with antivirals has been prescribed, particularly for people with weakened immune systems.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Economist blames red ink on recession -</b>
</div><div>By Bruce Owen    </div>

</p>
<p>A looming provincial budget deficit of about $600 million is more a symptom of the global recession than a government that can't control its spending, a Toronto economist says.</p>
<p>CIBC senior economist Warren Lovely said Manitoba's projected $592-million deficit for the 2009/10 budget year is in keeping with what other Canadian province's are experiencing with their pocketbooks. The province released the anticipated deficit on Tuesday in its second-quarter financial report. It's a $640-million negative adjustment to the $48-million summary surplus the province projected in the March budget.</p>
<p>"What Manitoba is going through is not dissimilar to what other provinces are going through in the rest of country," Lovely said. "I think it's safe to say that back in March the full extent of the weakness in the economy wasn't appreciated by anybody."</p>
<p>Lovely said the revenue shortfalls the Manitoba government cites are due in part to the recession in the United States, particularly with weaker industrial demand for electricity from <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>. Hydro's revised forecasted profit this year of $120 million is $145 million less than budgeted.</p>
<p>"These mid-year reports hopefully represent the worst," Lovely said, adding there are signs the economy is slowly improving. "There is reason for cautious optimism for the remaining quarters, but there is still some hard work to be done."</p>
<p>Besides the economy, Finance Minister Rosann Wowchuk has noted spring flooding and the campaign against the H1N1 flu hit the province's bottom line this year to the tune of $150 million. Plus, corporate income taxes are now forecast to come in $93 million lower than first predicted.</p>
<p>Despite the projected deficit, the government said Manitoba is still on track to average a $221-million surplus for the four-year period ending 2009-10, fulfilling its commitment under the Balanced Budget, Fiscal Management and Taxpayer Accountability Act. Under the act, budgeting is done over a four-year period and allows for a deficit to be posted in one of those years.</p>
<p>Critics say the deficit turn-about is more a sign of careless spending than the economy.</p>
<p>Opposition Progressive Conservative finance critic Rick Borotsik has said Premier Greg Selinger, who was finance minister for 10 years before taking over the premier's job in October, did not put away enough money in the fiscal stabilization fund to help offset bad budget years and also failed to pay down the province's debt.</p>
<p>Canadian Taxpayers Federation's Manitoba spokesman Colin Craig said the province should copy what New Brunswick is doing to right its financial ship. It placed a two-year wage freeze on public sector unions in last March's provincial budget to control expenses. Craig also said the province should freeze discretionary capital spending, such as work on the new Upper Fort Garry park on Main Street.</p>
<p>He said it also doesn't make sense for the province to commit $30 million towards a new polar bear exhibit at Assiniboine Park Zoo at this time, nor was it worth the estimated $35,000 it cost taxpayers to fly Selinger and other provincial officials to the recent world climate conference in Copenhagen.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Good thoughts on this most optimistic of days</b>
</div><div>LAWRENCE MARTIN   </div>

<p>lmartin@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, a day of bliss before the big one, we push aside the dreary thoughts and think of the good things.</p>
<p>From the year gone by, some come to mind.</p>
<p>This was the year when many feared the economy would fall off a cliff and we'd be in the dungeon of depression. It didn't happen. Capitalism survived. Keynesian economics – great, big government – came to the rescue. Wall Street teetered, but didn't topple. Auto companies were saved in bailouts. Consumers receded, but are back at the counters, grinningly loading up.</p>
<p>Over the perilous stretch, some learning was in evidence. Leaders learned not to repeat the mistakes of the early thirties that induced the Great Depression. They learned that when deregulation is dominant, when markets run free, grief follows. They knew from earlier experiences that, conversely, when the state gets too fat, the same can happen. The lesson for engraving is that compressed ideologies of the right and of the left are each to be avoided.</p>
<p>This was the year when swine flu, renamed H1N1, was supposed to swallow populations whole. Combine that with an economic collapse and you had the makings of an orgy of sorrow. But it didn't happen. The pandemic didn't pan out. H1N1 was not much worse than a normal flu season. While not quite in the class of WMDs, it was another hype job.</p>
<p>This was the year that threatened to put Canadians through the tedium of yet another federal election – the fourth in a five-year stretch. Smile, everyone. We avoided that as well.</p>
<p>Other good things transpired. Just when we thought our Prime Minister was becoming too lugubrious to bear, he shocked everyone by taking to the stage at one of those artsy galas he had flayed and did a rousing piano and song rendition of a Fab Four tune. Blood flowed through his veins. It was a sensation.</p>
<p>Past prime ministers did okay, too. Jean Chrétien received the exclusive Order of Merit from the Queen. It was a blessing for him because an overabundance of attention had been paid to the downside of his decade in power – the sponsorship imbroglio. There were other things the little guy from Shawinigan did. Hence the big prize.</p>
<p>His antagonist, Paul Martin, had something to be proud of as well. The G20 came formally into being as one of the world's foremost deliberative bodies. Mr. Martin was a driving force behind its creation. He set up a G20 of finance ministers and then pushed to have the concept broadened to heads of state. Canada's international image as a progressive, honest broker took a lot of hits in 2009. The formation of the G20 was more in keeping with our history.</p>
<p>One of the best things of the year didn't happen here, but its impact is very much felt in this country. The regressive span the United States endured under the gruesome twosome of George W. Bush and Dick Cheney came mercifully to a close on Jan. 20. In his first year in power, Barack Obama wasn't all he was cracked up to be. He was more a compromiser than a reformer. In escalating the Afghan conflict, he failed to move America off its crippling post-9/11 terrorist paranoia. But his administration steadied the economy after its near-collapse and has now, barring some unforeseen development, given his country, after a century of failed attempts, a semblance of a national health-care plan.</p>
<p>More importantly, despite the rabid counter-pressures of the legions on the American right, now led by hillbilly Sarah Palin, he has restored American fair-mindedness and faith in its leadership around the world. The prejudice of his predecessors is replaced by a man of enlightenment, inspiration and global perspective. Barack Obama has put his country back on the high road. He embodies the spirit as expressed in the words of Thomas Paine: “My country is the world and my religion is to do good.”</p>
<p>On Christmas Eve, such noble thoughts as that arise. It is the year's greatest day of anticipation, a day when the glimmers of optimism reach beyond the radiant faces of children to all ages. In 2009, we moved past the big scares. It was a year of survival. In 2K10, more is promised. Recovery begins in earnest. New frontiers beckon.</p>

</p>
<p>'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house,</p>
<p>No swine flu virus was spreading, not even to a mouse.</p>
<p>The sanitizer was placed by the sink with much care,</p>
<p>In hopes the end of the threat would soon be declared.</p>
<p>The children were cowering from the bug in their beds,</p>
<p>While visions of Tamiflu danced in their heads.</p>
<p>Mamma sneezed in her kerchief, Papa coughed in his sleeve,</p>
<p>If we are all immunized then this disease would just leave.</p>
<p>From Mexico H1N1 arrived like a flash,</p>
<p>One wave, then two, it cost loads of cash.</p>
<p>In the news, on the Web, arose such a clatter,</p>
<p>They dubbed it pandemic and made much of the matter.</p>
<p>We soon feared pork, travellers, then each other,</p>
<p>The memories of SARS became such a bother.</p>
<p>WHO said all humanity must be engaged in this battle,</p>
<p>The imminent global threat left us all rattled.</p>
<p>Level three, level four, level six back to five,</p>
<p>It's a wonder than any of us are still alive.</p>
<p>The numbers were staggering, millions could die,</p>
<p>Public health mobilized and not on the sly.</p>
<p>From province to province they said flu would go,</p>
<p>Infecting all in its path and laying them low.</p>
<p>When, what to our wondering eyes should appear,</p>
<p>But a pandemic plan that left us quacking with fear.</p>
<p>With serious messages expressed in grave tones,</p>
<p>It could be none other than David Butler Jones.</p>
<p>On radio, TV and newspaper ads he proclaimed,</p>
<p>Leona Aglukkaq, she said much the same.</p>
<p>“Wash your hands, wash your hands,” they maintained,</p>
<p>“Stay home if you're sick,” we must all do the same.</p>
<p>H1N1 has most assuredly gone viral,</p>
<p>Out of hand we can not let it spiral.</p>
<p>“Don't panic, don't panic, don't panic,” they said,</p>
<p>“Vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate,” instead.</p>
<p>Kiddies, preggers and priority groups first of all,</p>
<p>Then we jab 'em, we jab 'em, we'll jab 'em all.</p>
<p>We have enough vaccine to immunize all by Christmas,</p>
<p>The campaign's necessary, on this you can trust us.</p>
<p>Rush to a clinic, there's one close to you,</p>
<p>And remember queue-jumping's not a thing to do.</p>
<p>The doubters they said: “Well, this will never fly,</p>
<p>This vaccine's not needed, you've been caught in a lie.”</p>
<p>The shortages, the adjuvant, fuelled conspiracy theories,</p>
<p>Experts were stumped, couldn't keep up with the queries.</p>
<p>Spanish flu, don't forget, killed more young than old,</p>
<p>It could happen again, or so we were told.</p>
<p>Thus we stood in long lines for hours for the shot,</p>
<p>And later we'd wonder: Was it all for naught?</p>
<p>With nary a word, public health did its work,</p>
<p>The waits they all vanished, as did the irk.</p>
<p>This flu turned out to not be one for the ages,</p>
<p>Leaving us to wonder why we flew into rages.</p>
<p>The fear has since faded, the headlines have vanished,</p>
<p>The pandemic has peaked, the foe has been vanquished.</p>
<p>But no, we're still told, you could still get this bug,</p>
<p>'Cause during the holidays we kiss and we hug.</p>
<p>Giving the flu to granny is not a gift that will amuse,</p>
<p>Besides we have 20 million doses we still need to use.</p>
<p>Such a huge surplus is costly but ultimately pleasant,</p>
<p>To those more in need we can now send a nice present.</p>
<p>Was swine flu for real, a good old-fashioned threat?</p>

<p>This week's discovery of rodents at a Spadina Ave. pizza shop and a bakery outlet at a subway station has put the spotlight on Toronto's restaurant inspection program.</p>
<p>The pass-fail card system, in which a red card closes the eatery until problems are corrected, was set back by last summer's 39-day civic workers' strike and the fight against the H1N1 flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Inspectors have since been working hard to catch up.</p>
<p>"It's been a rough year," said Councillor John Filion, chair of Toronto's board of health.</p>
<p>Nearly every week in Toronto, an establishment is closed down temporarily for food safety infractions. There were 41 closures this year and 46 in 2008.</p>
<p>Those statistics indicate the city, which has some 16,000 restaurants, food stores and bakeries, is staying on top of the serious cases, said associate medical officer of health Dr. Howard Shapiro, who notes they inspect "probably a few hundred places a day."</p>

<p>Alberta posts first net outflow of people in 15 years</p>
<p>For the first time since 1994, Alberta attracted fewer Canadians from other provinces than the number who left in 2009, Statistics Canada says. But the province's population still grew in the third quarter of 2009 to 3,703,979 because of babies being born and arrivals from other countries, the agency said.</p>

</p>
<p>The number of new cases of H1N1 flu in B.C. is petering out but a health official says vigilance is needed to protect against a possible third wave.</p>
<p>The numbers from the latest weekly H1N1 update are encouraging, showing five new severe cases of the disease--three on Vancouver Island and one each in the Interior and Fraser Health regions -- as well as one new death in Vancouver Coastal Health, Deputy Provincial Health officer Dr. Eric Young said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It is slowing down quite a lot," Young said. "We are at the tail-end of the outbreak."</p>
<p>Since April, the B.C. Centre for Disease Control has confirmed 1,037 H1N1 cases. There have been 359 cases in Fraser Health, including 17 deaths; 234 in Interior Health, including 13 deaths; 44 in Northern Health, including two deaths; 258 in Vancouver Coastal Health, including 10 deaths; and 142 on Vancouver Island, including 10 deaths.</p>
<p>There have been 52 deaths due to H1N1 this year, with 45 of them involving underlying medical conditions. Two cases are still being investigated.</p>
<p>Young attributed the decline in new cases to the impact of the vaccine-- with just over 40 per cent of British Columbians having been vaccinated against H1N1 -- and the ability to quickly get anti-virals to people with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Young encouraged people to still get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"We are still a bit concerned about a third wave coming," he said. "Historically, when we have large pandemics like this, we see a third wave."</p>

</p>
<p>A Mouseland Gift of the magi. Based on the original fable by T.C. Douglas and updated to reflect Saskatchewan politics in December, 2009</p>
<p>As falling snowflakes danced on the steps of Mouseland's great Marble Palace, the two mortal enemies stepped out of the shadows to exchange their gifts.</p>
<p>There was nobody around to see Brad Cat and Dwain Mouse this Christmas embark on their wondrous gesture of sharing and kindness -- a quite remarkable event even for this metaphoric, fictitious political world we now visit but once a year.</p>
<p>Sadly, sharing and kindness had become rather scarce commodities in Mouseland -- now a misnomer of a place if there ever was one.</p>
<p>Rather than overrun with the vermin, those declaring themselves common mice had dwindled to a mere 26.4 per cent. Mouseland now was mostly inhabited by many other critters like rabbits and turkeys and pigs (now under creditor protection after being accused of starting H1N1) and gophers and chickens and coyotes (who were also in hiding, after ol' Bob Cat issued his five-dollar-a-paw bounty).</p>
<p>And there were cats, although it seemed all of Mouseland's cats had become as black as Christmas coal.</p>
<p>This constituted a major shift from how Mouseland politics used to operate. Traditionally, it was the mice that ran Mouseland because a little ol' churchmouse named Tommy -- as kind as he was shrewd -- discovered long ago that if the white cats and black cats were always fighting among themselves, they would never be able to get together to form a majority government.</p>
<p>But more than a decade ago, the white cats started clawing themselves into virtual extinction -- spelling big trouble for the mice.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, the cats, including a few that escaped the hoosegow in the 1990s, formed one party. And now under Brad Cat's popular leadership, Mouseland seemed more united under a cat government than ever.</p>
<p>Except that it really wasn't.</p>
<p>The emergence of a strong cat government had made the mice madder and feistier than ever -- especially after Rod Cat started estimating Mouseland's wealth while imbibing in a bit too much catnip.</p>
<p>So the feisty mice chose as their leader the biggest, baddest, mouse they could find -- Dwain Mouse.</p>
<p>Whether this had been a wise selection was becoming increasingly questionable. Right from the very first day when Dwain Mouse's leadership team signed up a whole bunch of other critters who weren't even mice, trouble seemed follow the mice's big cheese. Some could ignore the gray creeping into Dwain Mouse's whiskers, but few could ignore his plummeting in the polls.</p>
<p>But one thing about Dwain Mouse: He sure could get under the cat's fur. And Brad Cat -- a bit of hot-head, despite his fun-loving side -- was every bit as eager to claw, bite and scratch.</p>
<p>Somehow, Dwain Mouse and Brad Cat had combined to make Mouseland even more raucous than ever, although that didn't seem to be what either really wanted.</p>
<p>You see, Brad Cat had never been all that interested in being a capitalist cat. He was better at the charitable spending side of politics (he especially loved spending). And Dwain Mouse was about the oddest mouse you'll ever meet in that he had little time for a mouse's partialness to charity. He fancied himself a captain of industry.</p>
<p>So after many secret phone calls that the two swore they would never again bring up on the floor of the Marble Palace, the foes agreed to meet on the steps of the Marble Palace on Christmas Eve to give each other the gift each had always wanted.</p>
<p>They nervously stepped into the light, exchanged their neatly wrapped gifts and scurried off to open them in seclusion.</p>
<p>The snow fell silently this Christmas eve ... until the silence was pierced by two simultaneous agonizing screams!</p>
<p>Not really acquainted with the concept of charitable providence, Dwain Mouse's gift to Brad Cat was but an empty box. And not really sure how to achieve capitalistic prosperity, Brad Cat could offer Dwain Mouse nothing more than an empty vessel.</p>
<p>So ended another year in Mouseland, with each failing to deliver what they promised.</p>
<p>One can only wonder what the year to come holds.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario's information and privacy commissioner has launched an investigation after the health information of more than 83,000 people who attended H1N1 flu clinics in Durham Region, east of Toronto, was apparently lost.</p>
<p>A health department nurse was taking a USB key containing the records to her car in Whitby to take it to a remote clinic site on Dec. 15 when the device was lost. A search failed to turn it up.</p>
<p>"We believe it was lost on regional property. We have some video surveillance tape data to indicate that was the case," said Dr. Robert Kyle, chief medical officer of health for Durham Region.</p>
<p>The privacy commission office was advised Monday by the Durham Region health department that the device was missing, said spokesperson Bob Spence.</p>
<p>The USB key contained the names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth and health card numbers of patients who attended H1N1 flu vaccination clinics in the region between Oct. 23 and Dec. 15.</p>
<p>The device was not encrypted, even though Ontario Privacy Commissioner Ann Cavoukian had issued guidance to all health information custodians in March 2007 that where personal health data is stored on mobile devices in identifiable form, it must be encrypted.</p>
<p>That guidance was issued in a health order made to Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children after a laptop computer containing the personal health information of 2,900 patients was stolen from a doctor's minivan in downtown Toronto on Jan. 4, 2007.</p>
<p>"There is no excuse for unauthorized access to personal health information (PHI) due to the theft or loss of a mobile computing device - any PHI contained therein must be encrypted," Cavoukian said at the time.</p>
<p>When asked if the lack of encryption was a lapse, Kyle said that would be part of Durham Region's investigation.</p>
<p>The focus of the privacy commissioner's investigation will be on what happened, how it happened and what steps can be taken to prevent a similar incident from occurring in the future, Spence said.</p>
<p>The probe will work in co-operation with, but be separate from Durham Region's own probe, he added.</p>

</div><div>AARON DERFEL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>774 words</div><div>23 December 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>H1N1 was arguably the biggest news story of 2009.</p>
<p>It could also be argued that H1N1 was the biggest non-story of the year.</p>
<p>As a health reporter who has been on the beat for more than a decade, I've written my share of stories about superbugs like C. difficile, the SARS outbreak in Toronto in 2003 and the Asian flu scare of 2006.</p>
<p>So in late April, when reports first circulated of a mysterious new swine flu virus killing scores of mostly young Mexicans, I felt a sense of déjà vu. But at the same time, I was puzzled and anxious, especially after the World Health Organization warned that "all of humanity (was) under threat."</p>
<p>Those conflicting feelings - that the danger was being exaggerated and yet our lives were all under threat - would never leave me, and made reporting on this issue especially difficult.</p>
<p>Certainly, the lack of consensus among experts didn't help. Was the WHO correct in even declaring a pandemic in the first place, since it appeared the H1N1 strain was not nearly as virulent as initially feared? Richard Schabas, the medical officer of health for Hastings and Prince Edward Counties in Ontario, went so far as to predict H1N1 would be no more lethal than the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>In fact, by year's end it's projected that H1N1 will have killed slightly more than 400 Canadians. By comparison, the seasonal flu is estimated to cause up to 2,500 deaths annually, although no one has ever kept highly accurate statistics until H1N1.</p>
<p>What's more, no one will ever know just how deadly H1N1 could be because of the unprecedented mass vaccination campaign that unfolded. And there were still frightening cases of young, previously healthy individuals dying from H1N1, like 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio of Toronto.</p>
<p>Here in Quebec, confusion and panic quickly set in, often fuelled by some in the news media and by the very government that had pledged to protect us. Public health officials devised a highly controversial list of priority groups, with the elderly among the last to receive their shots.</p>
<p>In retrospect, that decision turned out to be questionable, as the greatest percentage of all deaths, by far, occurred in those over the age of 60.</p>
<p>There were other questionable calls, as well as conflicting information between the federal and provincial governments. First was the decision by the Public Health Agency of Canada to use an adjuvant in the vaccine, delaying its delivery and raising concerns about its safety, since pregnant women under 20 weeks would be given shots without the adjuvant.</p>
<p>An official with the agency even advised The Gazette not to describe the immunity-boosting adjuvant as a chemical compound, even though it is just that. In the end, there were few reports of severe reactions to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Equally challenging was trying to sort out all the contradictory pieces of information for readers. In the pages of The Gazette, Ottawa ran full-page ads about high-priority groups that didn't match up with other ads by the provincial government.</p>
<p>At the start of the vaccination campaign, both Ottawa and Quebec urged that children from the ages of 6 months to 5 years get a second booster shot, but weeks later they determined that a single inoculation was sufficient despite a lack of extensive research on the subject.</p>
<p>Like other journalists, I waited in line for a flu shot - actually, I had to go twice: first, to accompany my nearly 3-year-old son, Daniel, to receive his and then for myself. Yet just five days after getting the shot - during the peak of the second wave of infections - I, too, got the flu.</p>
<p>Ironically, I felt the quick onset of symptoms as I was filing an H1N1 story on deadline: a burning chest cough as I had never experienced as well as a fever, chills, muscle aches and a sudden weakness.</p>
<p>After the story was written, I lay down in bed for five days, wheezing, sweating and running a fever as high as 39 degrees Celsius. Did I catch H1N1? I was never tested, but the Info-Santé nurse I spoke to over the phone said that in all likelihood I did contract the pandemic flu strain.</p>
<p>I was fortunate not to have to go to the hospital, but I never could answer that nagging question: Was H1N1 a truly menacing pandemic strain or something merely akin to the typical flu?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Leader Swann taking heat for Liberals' tepid showing</b>
</div><div>Renata D'Aliesio, with files from Jason Fekete, Calgary
Herald   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>583 words</div><div>23 December 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>When David Swann took over the reins of the Alberta Liberals last year, the party was rebuilding again.</p>
<p>Facing a rookie Conservative leader, the Grits expected to improve their standing in the March 2008 provincial election. Instead, the Tories won a stronger majority and the Liberals were reduced to nine seats in the legislature.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to today: The long-ruling Conservatives are sinking in public opinion polls but the Liberals have made only modest gains.</p>
<p>While the scenario has some Grit members and political observers contending the party and its new boss are showing momentum, it has others questioning Swann's leadership.</p>
<p>Longtime Calgary Grit organizer Donn Lovett and Mount Royal University political scientist Keith Brownsey point to the surge of the Wildrose Alliance, led by Danielle Smith, as evidence that Albertans are frustrated with the Tory government.</p>
<p>"Danielle Smith has assumed the role of official Opposition because nobody else is assuming that role," Lovett suggested.</p>
<p>Brownsey added: "I put the blame squarely on the leader.</p>
<p>"He's the anti-politician. He doesn't know how to be a politician."</p>
<p>In some respects, it was Swann's anti-politician persona that vaulted him to the helm of the Liberal party last December, defeating Calgary MLA Dave Taylor and former Edmonton MLA Mo Elsalhy.</p>
<p>A Calgary MLA since 2004, Swann was a medical officer of health and a family physician before entering politics. He's thoughtful and mild-mannered and was well known for promoting environmental and social democracy causes.</p>
<p>One of his first acts as leader was to limit Grit MLAs from heckling Conservative government members during question period because he wanted to raise the level of decorum and respect in the legislature.</p>
<p>Swann concedes he and his party have to do a better job of connecting with Albertans and of communicating what the Grits stand for.</p>
<p>He doesn't view the Wildrose rise as a death knell for the Liberals. Swann notes the new right-wing party has created a wedge among conservatives -- one that could benefit the Grits.</p>
<p>"There's a tremendous opportunity there as the Tories eat themselves from within and split the vote," he said. "It does open up the centre, the sensible centre, where we think Albertans mostly sit."</p>
<p>A year into the job, Swann said he feels he's coming into his own as party leader and his team is growing stronger.</p>
<p>Elsalhy agrees, but adds it's time for the Grits to seize the agenda.</p>
<p>"David is a lot stronger today and a lot more convincing. He's grown," Elsalhy said. "In 2010, they have to market him and the party's platform much more aggressively."</p>
<p>Grit deputy leader Laurie Blakeman argues criticism of Swann's leadership is premature.</p>
<p>"For someone coming from I think what many would call a kind of lefty point of view, he's worked very hard to understand the important issues in the Calgary energy sector, in the financial sector in Alberta," Blakeman said. She noted that media coverage of Swann and the Liberals increased during the fall legislature session, highlighting the Conservative government's troubled rollout of the H1N1 flu vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>The Liberal party's financial picture has strengthened, too. Party president Tony Sansotta said the Grits are on track to retire the party's debt in the spring.</p>

</p>
<p>Crowds lined up behind a row of black curtains Tuesday afternoon to wait for their H1N1 and seasonal flu shots on the last day before clinics closed down for the holidays.</p>
<p>At the "roving" clinic set up at Ottawa City Hall on Monday, nurses saw about 800 people come in for their vaccinations and were anticipating the same or more for Tuesday, according to Maureen Lachance, supervisor of the immunization clinic.</p>
<p>"I suspect we are seeing (this many) people because it's the last day before Christmas," Lachance said. "It's been pretty constant, though. The numbers are there and people are interested."</p>
<p>More than half of Ottawa's residents have received H1N1 vaccinations, which surpasses the 40-per-cent target expected by Ottawa Public Health. Lachance said the immunizations have been well received and that the few people who have had bad reactions are usually those who have anxiety about getting the shot in the first place.</p>
<p>By mid-December, Ottawa Public Health had administered nearly 419,000 doses of the H1N1 vaccine since October. Compared to other cities, Ottawa appears to have a higher-than-average vaccination rate against swine flu.</p>
<p>Chris Stoney, waiting with his family at the City Hall clinic, said he hoped the line would move quickly. The family of four believe they all had the swine flu before the vaccinations were made available to the public and Tuesday was the first time they were all able to get the shots -- for H1N1 and the seasonal flu at the same time. But Stoney was uncertain about receiving both shots at once.</p>
<p>"I've heard mixed messages about getting the two shots and whether or not it is safe to get them both at once," Stoney said. He hoped there would not be any side-effects from the shots because he wanted his family to be healthy for the holidays.</p>
<p>Lachance says it is in fact safe to get the vaccinations at the same time, and she still encourages people to get them. "People will get very good coverage if they get both shots."</p>
<p>Richard Kalonji, on the other hand, waited until his children were out of school for the holidays before taking them to get their vaccinations. After waiting about half an hour, his four children had all received both H1N1 and seasonal flu immunizations. "I didn't want to have to take them out of school (if they had a bad reaction). Now if something does go wrong, I will be able to take care of them at home," Kalonji said.</p>
<p>While Tuesday was the last official day to receive the vaccinations at the clinics, Lachance says that come January, Ottawa residents will still have the chance to receive their immunizations. Clinics are still being booked, but, according to a news release from the city, they begin the afternoon of Jan. 6 at Sacred Heart High School, Jean-Robert Gauthier Catholic elementary school and Brookfield High School.</p>
<p>Overall, Lachance said the clinics have been running well. "I can't speak on behalf of all of the nurses but it's been a very good experience," she said. "I think all of them put their best foot forward in a massive exercise of collaborating. We are pleased and happy with the results."</p>

</p>
<p>The day after Christmas will mark two months since 13-year-old Evan Frustaglio died suddenly from the H1N1 flu virus and his story grabbed the nation's attention. Going to the grocery store without Evan is an emotional event, let alone facing the holidays, his father says.</p>
<p>"It is a debilitating heart-ache," Paul Frustaglio said in an interview as he described the waves of intense grief that come over him. "You can't walk, you can't breathe and it feels like your head is going to explode."</p>
<p>It was the morning of Monday, Oct. 26, when Frustaglio found his son on the bathroom floor of their Toronto-area home, gasping for air. The father picked up his son, who collapsed in his arms and fell unconscious. He never woke up. The paramedics arrived, but their efforts to revive the young hockey player were unsuccessful.</p>
<p>"They couldn't revive his heart," Frustaglio said. "They tried and tried. His little heart wouldn't start."</p>
<p>The Grade 8 student had fallen ill over the weekend and his mother brought him to a walk-in clinic on Sunday. He was sent home with instructions to take medication to treat his flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Less than 24 hours later, Evan's parents and younger brother were reeling from the shock that the H1N1 virus had claimed the teen's life.</p>
<p>"We're going down a really dark road in our life and we don't see any light, and we don't know when we will," Frustaglio said. "We were a strong family the four of us. So it's been difficult not having our other quarter of our whole there. That's the easiest way I can say it: A quarter of us is missing."</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio was not the first child to die from the H1N1 flu, but his death was the most highly publicized of all its victims in Canada. He was a young and healthy athlete who died quickly and on the same day H1N1 vaccine clinics opened.</p>
<p>"I was not going to let my son's death be a number, there was just no way," Frustaglio said.</p>
<p>When Evan's story was told by media outlets across the country, it caused concern among some parents, who, until then, hadn't paid much attention to the H1N1 pandemic. Worried parents who earlier had little enthusiasm for immunizing their children took them to the jam-packed clinics and waited for hours.</p>
<p>Canada's health minister, Leona Aglukkaq, and chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones were asked recently if they thought vaccine uptake would have been lower that first week of immunization programs if the Frustaglio's story wasn't so publicized.</p>
<p>"Absolutely," Aglukkaq said. "Totally," Butler-Jones said, also referring to what he said was the family's courage for sharing their story.</p>
<p>About 40 per cent of Canadians have been immunized against H1N1, and, while he didn't give precise numbers, Butler-Jones said he had heard from various jurisdictions that rates among children were higher than expected.</p>
<p>Evan Frustaglio would have been immunized had the shot been available before his death, his father says. He's encouraging Canadians to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I can't express how much pain I'm living through and if I can save one life or 20 or 100, then (Evan) didn't die in vain," Frustaglio said.</p>
<p>Frustaglio doesn't want Canadians to become complacent about the pandemic, but he feels the "Evan effect," as he calls it, is fading away.</p>
<p>"My son's face, that innocent boy, that was the Evan effect. It kicked everything in the butt to get it going," he said of the attention his son's death drew to H1N1 and the vaccine for it. The public and the media's attention, however, has since drifted away.</p>
<p>"It's just not a hot topic any more ... the problem is people are dying still every week," Frustaglio said. "Everybody should realize that it's real."</p>

</p>
<p>Veterinarians in White Plains, N.Y., have identified the first known case of pandemic H1N1 influenza in a dog -- a 13-year-old mixed-breed male who is now recovering. The dog was tested because his owner previously had swine flu.</p>
<p>The virus has been found before in other pets, including at least three ferrets, several cats and pigs, and a cheetah named Gijima at a wildlife preserve in Santa Rosa, Calif.</p>
<p>A couple of the cats died, but most of the animals recovered.</p>
<p>In each case, the virus is thought to have been transmitted to the animal by its owner or handler, and there is no evidence of the virus being passed back to a human.</p>
<p>These incidents "are not a reason to be concerned," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases.</p>
<p>"A rare occurrence in other species is not a problem."</p>
<p>And if you are wondering, the symptoms of flu in pets are the same as they are in humans: fever, lethargy, runny nose, lack of appetite, coughing and possibly sneezing.</p>

</p>
<p>I can't speak for Tiger Woods, but I know my wife, as a general rule of thumb, doesn't allow me to approach complete strangers in public places and ask them for hugs and kisses.</p>
<p>She's funny that way. Fortunately, my wife is a little more forgiving about me kissing strangers if it takes place during the Christmas season and I'm dressed as Santa Claus.</p>
<p>I should point out here I do not make a habit of putting on a red velvet suit and asking people to get up close and personal in exchange for candy canes.</p>
<p>But I agreed to give it a try after Free Press videographer Tyler Walsh sent me a news story stating that, according to British etiquette experts, even with fears of an H1N1 pandemic it's more hygienic to exchange kisses on the cheek under the mistletoe than to shake hands.</p>
<p>Tyler felt we should test this theory by having me dress up as everyone's favourite fat man and offer strangers a chance to (a) kiss Santa on the cheek; (b) give him a big bear hug; (c) shake his hand; or (d) bump fists or whatever bodily part they felt would best convey the true spirit of the holiday season.</p>
<p>We conducted this experiment at <span class="companylink">James Richardson International</span> Airport because, at the most hectic travel time of the year, what sane person, while running for an airplane, does not want to take a few minutes to hug and/or kiss a middle-aged newspaper columnist who is sweating profusely under a rented Santa suit.</p>
<p>So there Santa was Monday afternoon, microphone in one hand, bag of candy canes in the other, stalking hectic travellers to explain why it was safe to plant a holiday smooch on his cheek.</p>
<p>Before confronting the general public, Santa warmed up on the nice folks in the human resources office at the Winnipeg Airports Authority.</p>
<p>Santa first explained all the options to Andrea Wolters, but she quickly rejected them. "Um, none of the above," is what she told Santa.</p>
<p>Then, seeing Santa's sad face, she chirped: "How about a pat on the back?" So Santa did not get off to a hot start, but things improved when he approached HR co-ordinator Taina Williams.</p>
<p>"I can shake hands because I have a bottle of hand sanitizer," Taina declared.</p>
<p>"Is there any way Santa's getting a kiss?"</p>
<p>Taina pondered this. "I can go for a hug," she said. So things were looking up.</p>
<p>It needs to be recorded here that Santa got his first hygienic kisses from HR manager Dianna Richardson and Christine Alongi, the airports authority's public relations director. In fact, Christine kissed both of Santa's rosy cheeks. "Well, you see, I'm French," she explained.</p>
<p>Santa then got a Tiger-style fist bump from Barry Rempel, CEO of the airports authority, who also gave Santa a swell tuque and scarf, which was nice.</p>
<p>His "kiss me or hug me" speech honed to perfection, Santa staggered into the bustling terminal in search of holiday affection from the travelling public.</p>
<p>Despite being a veteran elf, Santa got a little misty-eyed when he received spontaneous hugs from Lauren Hartley, 3, and Christa Hartley, 6. After Santa explained his mission to their mom, Lisa, she turned to the kids and asked: "What should we do? A hug or a kiss for Santa?"</p>
<p>With wide-eyed delight, they shrieked: "A KISS!"</p>
<p>"What will daddy say?" mom wondered.</p>
<p>"We won't tell dad," Santa promised. "It will be our secret."</p>
<p>With that, Lisa agreed "Santa deserves a kiss," and planted a welcome smooch on his sweaty cheeky. There isn't room to describe every dramatic encounter, but Santa would be remiss if he didn't point out that, after exchanging hugs and fist bumps with the Thomas family, Santa received a festive "come-hither" shout from a lovely woman named Bonnie, who was checking in for a holiday in Mexico. As hundreds of bemused travellers looked on, Bonnie was persuaded to plant a smooch in the middle of Santa's phoney beard.</p>
<p>"Can you tell the boys and girls why it's OK to kiss Santa?" I asked later.</p>
<p>"Because Santa doesn't have any germs!" Bonnie squealed in delight.</p>
<p>"Will you tell that to Mrs. Claus?" Santa begged. All in all, Santa made merry with about 40 frazzled travellers, pilots and airport staff, most of whom offered hugs and handshakes, but at least six of whom were willing to pucker up.</p>
<p>So Santa spread cheer. He spread mirth. But, hopefully, he didn't spread any germs. Before jumping into his sleigh, he wants to wish everyone a very merry Christmas.</p>
<p>And he has a special message for everyone who didn't give him a kiss: Remember, Santa knows when you're asleep!</p>

<div id="hd"><b>NDP pursue tuberculosis strategy - Vow to end suffering on First Nations</b>
</div><div>By Jen Skerritt   </div>
<div>748 words</div><div>23 December 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Two Manitoba MPs will push for a new tuberculosis strategy to eliminate what they call Canada's "national embarrassment."</p>
<p>Winnipeg North MP Wasylycia-Leis, Churchill MP Niki Ashton and the federal NDP's aboriginal affairs critic Jean Crowder have struck a committee to develop a national action plan to eliminate TB in First Nations communities. They plan to introduce their strategy as a private member's bill when Parliament resumes in late January, in addition to calling an emergency debate on the issue.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said the move is a reaction to a recent Free Press series that revealed some Manitoba First Nations have recorded some of the highest rates of TB in the world since the mid-1970s. Some northern Manitoba communities have recorded more than 600 cases of TB per 100,000 -- more than 100 times what their rate should be.</p>
<p>By comparison, Canada's national rate is five cases per 100,000. In developing countries such as Bangladesh, the rate is slightly below 400 cases per 100,000.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said she wants to see the Harper government make TB a top priority and work with aboriginal communities to end a curable scourge.</p>
<p>"I think the federal government can play a key role by saying this is a national priority," she said. "(It's) a national embarrassment. Here we are heading into 2010 and a curable disease is taking a toll on our First Nations communities."</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq was unavailable for comment.</p>
<p>TB is an infectious disease that experts say is a symptom of poverty, and a byproduct of overcrowded homes, malnutrition and poor overall health. The airborne disease is rampant in many northern Manitoba reserves where more than 10 people are crammed into a small house and access to clean running water and affordable healthy food is limited.</p>
<p>Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak (MKO) Grand Chief David Harper said he thinks developing a national strategy is a great idea. It should include better housing, access to running water and infrastructure improvements, he added.</p>
<p>While a major TB outbreak in Harper's home community of Garden Hill in 2006 did little to prompt a response from the federal government, he is optimistic that things will be different in the wake of the H1N1 crisis.</p>
<p>The same deadly mix that let H1N1 flourish in remote aboriginal communities last spring has allowed TB to persist on Manitoba reserves for a century.</p>
<p>Half of the 500 overcrowded houses in Garden Hill aren't hooked up to the main water line, making handwashing -- one of the basic keys to prevent the spread of disease -- more difficult.</p>
<p>"This is really a good time to bring about that kind of change," Harper said. "This is one of the issues we'd want to be 100 per cent involved in."</p>
<p>Ashton said better housing and increased support for healthy food initiatives will be included in the new strategy.</p>
<p>She said the federal government needs to take a targeted approach to address the living conditions and the root causes of TB in order to stop the spread.</p>
<p>"The fact that Canada in 2009 has tuberculosis rates on par with a Third World country is shameful," Ashton said.</p>
<p>Manitoba Health Minister Theresa Oswald called the idea of a national strategy "hugely encouraging" and said she'd like to see more work done to address the health disparities between aboriginals and non-aboriginals. She said the source of much of Manitoba's TB problem stems from poor, overcrowded housing in some communities, and poor health.</p>
<p>She said Ottawa has spent more on health recently. She hopes it devotes more resources to close the gaps. "I will be cautiously optimistic," she said.</p>
<p>jen.skerritt@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>What is TB?</p>
<p>TB spreads like the common cold. A person can become infected with TB if they inhale airborne droplets from an infected person who is coughing, sneezing, spitting or even talking. TB germs usually spread through prolonged, close contact with an infected person.</p>
<p>TB can be cured with nine months of drug treatment. If TB is left untreated, a person with active disease will infect an average of 10 to 15 people a year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>1most important works of the decade No. 8: 'I Dreamed a Dream'</b>
</div><div>John Sakamoto   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>579 words</div><div>23 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>E01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>We asked our critics and our readers to vote for the 10 most important works of the decade. We count down to No. 1 as we approach Dec. 31.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying Susan Boyle caused swine flu," one Sion Simon joked via that most brutally efficient of social media outlets, Twitter. "I am just saying that nobody had swine flu, she sang on TV, people got swine flu."</p>
<p>Simon happens to be a British Labour MP, a vocation that perhaps partially accounts for his tone deafness to the nuances of a well-told joke. At the time - late April, a couple of weeks after Boyle's galvanizing appearance on the U.K. reality show Britain's Got Talent - he also held the post of minister for further education, which seems entirely appropriate, since he was about to get one.</p>
<p>"Earlier I repeated a joke that was in poor taste, which I now regret," he grovelled a couple of days later, again on Twitter. "I apologise (sic) wholeheartedly for any distress or embarrassment caused."</p>
<p>The only distress or embarrassment it likely caused was to the MP himself, who had to fend off the vitriolic reaction of passionate music fans (though not, tellingly, of voters outraged that he would kid about a disease that has claimed thousands of lives).</p>
<p>Which brings us to that now-celebrated seven-minute clip that has been viewed online more than 200 million times.</p>
<p>It is, above all, a potent demonstration of the power of confluence: old and new media, reality and verisimilitude, lifelong anonymity and instant fame.</p>
<p>Forget the cultural resonance of American Idol. A television show that most of what is now Boyle's constituency could not even view in its original airing has managed to telescope the years-long arc of a musical career into the time it takes to down a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>It renders geographical boundaries irrelevant, simultaneously reinforces the importance of talent and consigns it to a supporting role, and upends the deeply ingrained requirement that our pop stars adhere to an excruciatingly circumscribed notion of acceptable appearance.</p>
<p>On the downside, it also virtually guarantees that anyone who finds fame in this manner has peaked upon arrival.</p>
<p>After all, Boyle's irresistible narrative - an ungainly, unemployed, small-town wallflower comes out of nowhere and takes the world by storm - assisted as it was by masterful editing (check out the skilful medley of crowd and judges' reaction shots) can, by definition, happen only once in a career. Even a <span class="companylink">Disney</span> teen star like Miley Cyrus is bound to experience a more dynamic professional trajectory.</p>
<p>One final thing: watch the end of Boyle's performance. As soon as she's finished belting out the song's last, crowning note, she promptly turns on her heel and begins strolling, obliviously andapparently contentedly toward the wings.</p>
<p>Granted, her oddball actions may simply have been a case of her nerves getting the better of her. Then again, there's another, considerably more appealing inference: that she'd succeeded on her own terms, accomplished what she set out to do, and didn't feel the slightest compunction to stick around for the validation of a bunch of obscenely compensated, obsessively coiffed, self-appointed arbiters of popular taste.</p>
<p>The joke, we'd like to think, is on them.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Identity theft feared as data lost; Durham Region's loss of flu clinic information on 83,524 people called 'disturbing'</b>
</div><div>Carola Vyhnak   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>587 words</div><div>23 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of people who attended flu clinics in Durham Region may be at risk of identity theft following the disappearance of a USB key containing their personal information.</p>
<p>Health card numbers included in the data could allow thieves to gather more information needed to use someone else's identity, said Tamir Israel, staff lawyer for the Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"The risk for identity theft with this information is very high," he said on Tuesday after Durham's health department issued a news release announcing the loss of the portable storage device.</p>
<p>The key contained data for 83,524 people who attended the department's H1N1 and seasonal flu vaccination clinics between Oct. 23 and Dec. 15. It was used to store information from eight clinics being taken to the computer server at regional headquarters at Rossland Rd. E. and Garden St. in Whitby.</p>
<p>A health department nurse dropped it on Dec. 16 between the building and parking garage, said Dr. Robert Kyle, commissioner and medical officer of health for the region. "We've spent many days mobilizing quite a number of staff to search high and low for this thing, and come up dry. It's extremely regrettable and unfortunate. Any time there's a privacy breach, people should be concerned."</p>
<p>The information in the "huge file" was not encrypted, but to read it you would need to know which file to open and what application to use, Kyle said. Once open, you'd see "meaningless symbols" among which names, addresses, phone numbers and health card numbers could be deciphered.</p>
<p>Other personal health details that patients provided at the clinics could not be read, he said.</p>
<p>While the device's loss was reported immediately and a surveillance camera showed someone picking it up and putting it on a rock, searchers failed to find it later, Kyle said.</p>
<p>Ajax resident Brian Johnson, whose wife and 3-year-old son received flu shots at clinics in Pickering, was appalled at what he called a lack of care and organization.</p>
<p>"I'm disturbed on a number of levels. Why is such sensitive data on a device that could be so easily lost?"</p>
<p>Johnson, a management consultant, found it "pretty damned disturbing" that he learned about the loss through the media and not the municipality. He was concerned about personal data such as his health card number and "anything that might compromise my identity" being released.</p>
<p>Israel agreed personal information should be encrypted to prevent identity theft, which is "growing phenomenally," he said. "It depends on whose hands it ends up in. There's some luck involved."</p>
<p>Worried about the public's loss of confidence in Durham's health department, Kyle put the loss down to "human error." Using the device to transfer data to a server is a common procedure the department has followed for years, he said.</p>
<p>The incident comes as the province is in the midst of a problem-plagued attempt to computerize all medical records across Ontario.</p>

<p>Ontario's privacy commissioner has launched an investigation after a USB drive containing the personal health information of more than 80,000 people who went to flu clinics in Durham Region -- just north of Toronto -- went missing.</p>
<p>Commission spokesman Bob Spence said the probe will try to determine what happened and how to prevent a similar incident from occurring.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Kyle, Durham Region's medical health officer, said the organization has also launched its own investigation and is evaluating its privacy policies and procedures after the unencrypted device was lost last Wednesday by a public health nurse.</p>
<p>It includes the names, addresses, phone numbers, dates of birth, health card numbers and the names of primary physicians for 83,524 people who visited flu clinics for a seasonal or H1N1 shot.</p>

<p>We might not notice them, but they're always there. They greet us, guide us into the queue, direct us to the washroom, listen to our concerns and chat with us.</p>
<p>They amount to a huge workforce that is never paid.</p>
<p>"Without the volunteers, this wouldn't work," says Harry Secuur, a 76 year old volunteer at the H1N1 Mass Immunization Clinic located in the former Robert Usher Collegiate.</p>
<p>Pam Larsen, public health nurse consultant with Population and Health Services -- who co-ordinates the volunteers -- agrees.</p>
<p>"We couldn't run without them," she says, with a grateful smile to Secuur and Jan Ayer, another volunteer.</p>
<p>Both Secuur and Ayer have been there since the beginning -- late October -- when the clinic opened its doors to health-care workers.</p>
<p>At the beginning of December, volunteers had worked 684 shifts -- each typically lasting four hours -- at the Usher clinic and the clinic in Mosaic Stadium's Green and White Room, says Larsen.</p>
<p>Retirees Secuur and Ayer plan to volunteer at the clinic until the doors close for good. They say they enjoy volunteering because it helps them to get out and interact with people.</p>
<p>Secuur -- retired for 11 years -- has even submitted his name for next fall's seasonal flu clinic.</p>
<p>"What do I do besides sitting at home, watching the television set or being behind a computer? I like to do this," says Secuur. "I think when you're retired, you get sort of into a routine -- you do this, you do that -- and this gives me a break."</p>
<p>"I did some of the morning shifts, which start at 8:30, and I'm like 'OK, I'm getting up, taking a shower. It's just like going to work!' This is so good!" says Ayer, who retired three years ago.</p>
<p>"You get to get out and meet people. It's surprising -- being in Regina -- I see people I know."</p>
<p>Secuur usually starts his shift at 12:30 p.m., but always comes in at noon to make sure he gets his favourite job -- guiding people waiting in the queue to the next available nurse.</p>
<p>"I'm sort of the host, because I bring them to the tables," says Secuur, with a laugh.</p>
<p>It's Ayer's favourite job, too, because she gets a chance to talk with people standing in line.</p>
<p>That helps them relax and keep their mind off what's going to happen, says Secuur -- "although it's not a big thing, but to some people it is," he adds.</p>
<p>Secuur has reached the point where he can tell whether a person is comfortable at the clinic or not. If someone seems really anxious, he asks the head nurse to watch them in case they pass out.</p>
<p>"You can't just walk up to a person (and say) 'Go over there.' I don't think that's the right thing to do. So I try to make it as pleasant as possible," says Secuur.</p>
<p>Ayer constantly receives compliments about how organized the clinic is.</p>
<p>Without the volunteers, Larsen says, the clinic would not be so organized or even operational.</p>
<p>"I feel very, very lucky that we've had such a large group, and people have been very generous with their time," says Larsen.</p>
<p>She adds she wants to say "thank you, thank you, thank you" to all the volunteers -- who often don't get breaks, if the clinic is busy -- as well as health services and community organizations that provide volunteers.</p>
<p>On Dec. 4, health minister Don McMorris acknowledged the efforts of volunteers.</p>
<p>"This is the biggest immunization that Canada has ever seen -- that Saskatchewan has ever seen -- and I think it takes a lot of hands on deck, but it's worked out very well," says McMorris.</p>

<p>Unneeded diabetes tests could be cut: new study</p>
<p>A new study says Ontario could save tens and even hundreds of millions of dollars by cutting back on the number of unnecessary glucose tests people with Type 2 diabetes perform weekly.</p>
<p>The study authors, including a McMaster University researcher in family medicine, suggest the amount the province will have to spend on glucose test strips over the next five years could be cut by between $26 million and $300 million, depending on how often people are told to test their levels.</p>
<p>The changes, if implemented, would not apply to people with Type 1 diabetes or people who control Type 2 diabetes with insulin.</p>
<p>Tara Gomes, author of the paper appearing in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, says studies have shown the multiple-times-a-day glucose testing recommended for people with Type 2 diabetes doesn't actually improve their glucose control and can trigger anxiety and depression.</p>
<p>She says cutting the number of tests back to twice a week or something in that range would not increase the risk to the individuals but would save the Ontario government large sums.</p>
<p>The authors, including Mac's Mike Paterson, say if the policy on testing doesn't change, Ontario will spend $500 million in the next five years paying for glucose test strips for people 65 and older.</p>
<p>Light box, exercise beat the Christmas blues</p>
<p>The holiday season is here, and for some that means additional emotional stress and depression.</p>
<p>But there are ways to cope.</p>
<p>Listen to Dr. Laura Miller, the director of women's mental health in the psychiatry department at Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston.</p>
<p>If seasonal depression worsens, Miller suggests a special therapeutic light box might help in the morning. Exercise can also make you feel better.</p>
<p>If you're busy and stressed out, she suggests making time for activities such as walking, meditating, exercising and hanging out with friends.</p>
<p>Also consider buying prepared foods instead of trying to make everything yourself.</p>
<p>Poll shows many think swine flu risk overblown</p>
<p>A poll suggests Canadians are generally satisfied by the way governments handled the H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>The Canadian Press Harris- Decima survey also suggests Canadians think the risk of swine flu was exaggerated.</p>
<p>Now many clinics have closed and the rate of new infections seems to be dropping.</p>
<p>That appears to be reflected in a receding level of concern among those surveyed.</p>
<p>Plastic sex toys spark fears over chemicals</p>
<p>Concern about products containing bisphenol A and phthalates is spreading.</p>
<p>Managers at some Edmonton stores that sell plastic adult sex toys say they have already removed items containing the controversial chemical.</p>
<p>Toronto MP Carolyn Bennett is also calling on the federal health minister to regulate the industry.</p>
<p>Bisphenol A and phthalates are used to make plastic toys soft and flexible. Studies have shown the chemicals can cause hormonal complications at a certain level of exposure.</p>
<p>More nurses working, total hits 341,431</p>
<p>A new study finds that the number of nurses working in Canada rose by 8.3 per cent between 2004 and last year.</p>
<p>The report by the Canadian Institute for Health Information says the number of employed nurses reached 341,431.</p>
<p>It indicates the rate of growth for registered nurses and licensed practical nurses exceeded the rate of population growth over the past five years.</p>
<p>An official with the Canadian Nurses Association says they're encouraged to see the rise in the number of RNs.</p>
<p>One positive development is an increase in community health nurses and a rise in those working in telehealth.</p>

<p>Skeptics reject the facts</p>
<p>The more I look at the people skeptical of global warming, the more I notice the similarities between them and the Young-Earth Creationist movement. Both reject the evidence in the fields they seek to bring down and fail to expose their evidence to peer-review. They claim global conspiracies are determined to hide the real findings of their experiments, and haven't brought a single piece of evidence to back up that claim. They talk about the topics in the media instead of leaving the issue to the scientific community. Most importantly, they reject the scientific method.</p>

<p>Reserves don't work</p>
<p>Re: The city on reserves (Dec. 11) by Michael Melanson. Perhaps the time has come for real change. I am referring to the concept of First Nations reserves, urban or otherwise.</p>
<p>When reserves were first established, Canadian culture and political mindset were vastly different. As Melanson states, Canada is a democratic nation. That means living here has rights and responsibilities. It is my opinion that reserves don't work and haven't for quite some time. It's time they became a thing of the past and were replaced with towns and communities where people work, own homes, and have a real choice in how to lead their lives. Maybe then, the majority of First Nations people could truly grow and prosper with something of their own to strive for instead of the current system of reserves, poverty, and dependency.</p>

<p>Bring back Christmas</p>
<p>I attended my grandson's and grand-niece's school Christmas concert in the town of St. Pierre Jolys and was left feeling sad, empty and disillusioned. Though the hard work of the students and teachers was apparent, I felt more like I was attending a Folklorama opening than a Christmas concert. Each class had a theme, one was Christmas in Mexico and Brazil, etc. Four in total. All songs were sung in the theme's native language, the only semblance of Christmas was the song Silent Night, which was sung in Japanese. My husband and I looked at each other, he turned to me and said: "I guess that is their way of not offending anyone by singing it in a different language."</p>
<p>My mind drifted as I thought of Christmas past when my five-year-old son, now 26, was dressed as the star of Bethlehem. Those concerts were filled with Christian themes back then and I thought about how things had changed in 20 years. In a world surrounded by a sea of political correctness, it seemed to me once again that Christ was left out of Christmas.</p>
<p>We as grandparents would have a job to teach our grandchildren about God, and the true meaning of Christmas as it is evident that our schools are no longer required, or should I say allowed, to teach our children religion. This is a predominantly Christian community, but you wouldn't know it. I do have to say I will try even harder now to teach my grandchildren about Jesus because in this world, they are going to need it.</p>

<p>A scientific definition</p>
<p>Re: Don't trust experts (Dec. 16). For the benefit of Rick Hisco, an epidemic is the proliferation of an infectious disease beyond what is normally observed while a pandemic is an epidemic that spreads across different regions. Contrary to Hisco's belief, the number of dead is not part of the definition.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization declared H1N1 to be a pandemic on the above standard, scientific definition. It did not fearmonger as Hisco states. It simply applied the standard, scientific definition correctly.</p>

<p>Chopper a good deal</p>
<p>Your city council's recent decision to purchase a helicopter demonstrates a foresight of which my own province's capital city has been sorely lacking for decades. This aircraft will swiftly prove its value. The significant savings from civil litigation settlements alone, arising out of high-speed pursuits gone awry, will offset initial purchase costs. This aircraft and its crew, while working in conjunction with local fire, ambulance and citizen volunteers, will also save countless lives over time, from the occasional lost child to an ever-increasing number of senior citizens living with many different forms of dementia.</p>
<p>In the 1970s, the Los Angeles police department coined the phrase "force multiplier" in relation to one professionally crewed helicopter having the operational capabilities of 20 cruisers in terms of containment and perspective from above.</p>
<p>Your police officers will do their homework and develop a professional, aviation support service which will make Winnipeg proud.</p>

<p>Better solution needed</p>
<p>Re: Freeway could save $450 million (Dec. 14). I understand Inkster Boulevard will be twinned to accommodate increased traffic. The advantage will be less traffic on Highway 101 west.</p>
<p>It seems to me that what will happen is that traffic on Inkster and Brookside Boulevard will increase. Anyone that drives by this intersection now will tell you that traffic is already heavy, in part due to the number of truck terminals near this intersection. What is needed at this intersection is a grade separation, probably a full cloverleaf. Adding more traffic at this intersection without addressing the congestion is going to make things worse.</p>
<p>What would help is to pave Sturgeon Road from Inkster to Highway 101 north, allowing some traffic to bypass the Inkster/Brookside intersection.</p>

<p>Cheaper... at what price?</p>
<p>Cellphone users will likely applaud the government's decision to allow a new company to enter the market. Prices will likely fall as a result of this market-based solution to the highest-priced regime in the world.</p>
<p>Industry Canada has found that this new entrant to the cellphone market qualifies as a Canadian company, contrary to the judgment of the regulatory body, which is tasked with determining what level of foreign ownership is consistent with Canadian law and, more importantly, with international agreements such as the FTA and NAFTA. A dangerous precedent has been set, not by Industry Canada, but by the Harper government, which undoubtedly ordered the department to come up with the policy it wanted.</p>
<p>So, you might see your cellphone costs go down, but at what price? Suppose cash-strapped Canwest sought out a large majority share of capital from Fox, installed a largely Canadian board of governors and used the cellphone decision to argue that its Global TV network, bankrolled by Rupert Murdoch, qualified as a Canadian entity. Do Canadians really want that type of ideological and political sewage emanating from Canadian TV stations?</p>
<p>RANDALL McGUNIGAL</p>

<p>E-waste a hidden cancer?</p>
<p>Around 20 per cent of our computers, TVs and cellphones are recycled. Many of these obsolete gadgets end up in landfills where they make up 70 per cent of the toxic waste in U.S. landfills. Unlike Europe, where e-waste is not allowed in landfills and manufacturers are responsible for e-waste disposal, Canada had no mandatory recycling e-waste laws. This is a virtual guarantee to create deadly toxins in landfills that will contaminate the soil, pollute our waterways and leave a degraded environment for years to come.</p>
<p>The cost of mandatory recycling is miniscule compared to future clean-up efforts required. What about the diseases caused by exposure to this toxic waste to humans and animals alike? Dare we pass on this contamination to the next generation?</p>
<p>Why are the politicians not acting? There needs to be an incentive to recycle each piece of electronic equipment, where at approved delivery sites old electronic items are accepted for a refund. Remember the refunds given for returning glass soda pop bottles? The same thing can be done for e-waste like old cellphones. It has worked in the past. It can work again for obsolete computers.</p>

<p>Questions, questions, I have questions. Most of them are aimed at the provincial government, so I don't expect answers. The government's Orwellian definition of its "open, honest" commitment doesn't allow that kind of thing.</p>
<p>- If British Columbia is the Best Place on Earth, as the government keeps repeating, why do so many politicians head to Hawaii for their vacations?</p>
<p>Why would they settle for what they believe to be second-best? Have they never seen Fernie in winter? Or Smithers? No beachfront bars, I admit, but certainly pretty with all that snow and with great skiing just up the hill.</p>
<p>If this is the Best Place on Earth, why are our leaders in such a rush to get out?</p>
<p>- Where will the government cuts come? The September budget update was nasty, but it carried the promise that much worse was to come in the next budget on March 2, 2010.</p>
<p>Arts, sports and community groups are likely to suffer more than they already have. Looking for more help for abused women or kids? That's not a priority, so forget it.</p>
<p>At a certain point, though, cuts to discretionary grants will not satisfy the bean counters. If the goal is to govern by the numbers rather than the needs, you have to look at cutting employees.</p>
<p>To have a real impact on the next fiscal year, which starts on April 1, staff cuts will have to start early in the new year. So, in January, how many layoff notices will we see?</p>
<p>- When will the government make a serious effort to sell us on the merits of the harmonized sales tax? Its efforts to date have been abysmal -- "You are going to drink that medicine, kid, and you are going to like it."</p>
<p>Telling us that the tax will be good for the economy isn't enough, especially when the tax increase is clear and lower costs are theoretical. What will the tax mean to individuals? Why can't we have some examples of prices that are likely to go down when the tax arrives on July 1?</p>
<p>I can understand that the government is charging ahead and ignoring anyone with concerns. But we have yet to see a credible message and that is a management failure. Has the government already laid off the people who would know how to sell this stuff to the public?</p>
<p>- Will we have labour peace in 2010? Hmm. A bunch of government contracts are expiring just after the Olympics. The government says it won't consider higher salaries.</p>
<p>Yet raises have been given to registered nurses and they are being given by local governments. Beyond that, there is a perception that the Liberals are governing for the rich and not the rest of us. That leaves plenty of room for jealousy, bitterness and determination to get a fair share. Really think the unions will go quietly?</p>
<p>- How should employers balance H1N1 and sick time? Times are tight, so supervisors are being told to ensure nobody is slacking off. We are also being told that if there is the slightest risk of H1N1, we should stay away so we don't infect everyone else.</p>
<p>Can't have it both ways. Which would you prefer?</p>
<p>- Why do so many people still believe that a government has to be run like a business? Setting aside the obvious -- that many businesses are run badly -- only a fool would fail to see that there are fundamental differences. A business is supposed to make a profit, a government is supposed to set good public policy and provide important services.</p>
<p>Yes, government can learn from business. But does that mean it has to be run that way?</p>
<p>- If money is such a concern within government, why have ministries not embraced open-source software? Why do they continue to pay for expensive commercial licences when they could get the open-source equivalent for free? The government in the United Kingdom has gone the free route, as has the city of Vancouver. Are they smarter than the province?</p>
<p>How many arts groups will lose their funding so the government can keep paying Bill Gates? How many employees will lose their jobs? Who makes these decisions, anyway?</p>
<p>- Once the decision was made to replace career bureaucrats with people with backgrounds in the corporate world, should we have been surprised that the government's values changed dramatically?</p>
<p>Sure, it's nice that things can be measured on a spreadsheet. But what about the intangibles, like issues, sustainability, the future, viability and, um, people?</p>
<p>- In 2009, what have we done to make this a better place?</p>
<p>Just wondering.</p>

<p>The Saskatchewan Public Health Association congratulates the Health Ministry and the regional health authorities for the very successful delivery of the H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>Their ability to inform the public regarding the H1N1 pandemic was commendable, especially in light of the misinformation communicated by various media. People attending the clinics commented that volunteers and staff were well organized, knowledgeable and friendly.</p>
<p>Unlike other jurisdictions across Canada which ran out of vaccines or where people endured eight-hour lineups, the Saskatchewan program delivered the program in a fair, efficient and organized fashion. As you might be aware, Saskatchewan was considered exemplary across Canada in the way its H1N1 campaign was handled. Saskatchewan was the first region to set up its health emergency operations centres at the ministerial level and within all health regions, which brought significant positive results.</p>
<p>All members of the health-care delivery team have managed to deliver the vaccination program as effectively and cost efficiently a way as possible. Public health programs came together to educate the public and set up effective operating clinics for vaccinations. All public health disciplines worked together for the betterment of the public. People were brought out of retirement to support the vaccination clinics, with others being supported to work outside their traditional provider areas to lend a caring hand. Countless hours of dedication and effort happened behind the scenes to make it go right.</p>
<p>Yes, there were challenges, but they were overcome through diligence and hard work. Well done.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health region expecting large deficit</b>
</div><div>Pamela Cowan   </div>
<div>Leader-Post</div>
<div>400 words</div><div>22 December 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>The Sunrise Health Region is projecting a larger-than-anticipated deficit this year.</p>
<p>"We budgeted for $179 million in expenditures this year, but we're currently forecasting expenditures of $181 million," said Sharon Tropin, the region's director of communications.</p>
<p>The region had budgeted for a year-end $1.5-million deficit, but H1N1-related expenditures contributed an additional $500,000 to the bottom line.</p>
<p>"The H1N1 costs may be offset by the province, but we're still awaiting notification," Tropin said.</p>
<p>The region's H1N1-related costs cover supplies, additional staffing, advertising and rental space for some of the immunization clinics.</p>
<p>"We used a combination of donated space, health region facilities and schools, as well as some rental space," Tropin said.</p>
<p>Adding to the health region's financial challenges are the province's belt-tightening measures.</p>
<p>In response to lower-than-expected potash revenue, the provincial government announced $8.1 million in program reductions, including $5 million trimmed from the health regions' non-clinical programs.</p>
<p>The Sunrise Health Region's portion of the $5-million cuts translated to a base funding reduction of $305,000 for 2009-10. To cope with the reduction, the region will not be filling a variety of vacant positions, Tropin said.</p>
<p>"The vacant positions are in the areas of administration, the autism program and nurse practitioner services," she said. "No positions are being cut. The positions were either filled later in the year than budgeted or are not yet filled as some are for difficult-to-recruit positions."</p>
<p>Until the region can fill the positions, it has adjusted existing resources to continue these program areas.</p>
<p>"The region will continue to actively recruit for these positions," Tropin said.</p>
<p>The Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's portion of the $5-million program reductions is $1.358 million, said Mark Torjusen, spokesman for the RQHR.</p>
<p>"The region will meet our requirement by not filling vacant administration positions and as a result of being unable to fill hard-to-recruit clinical positions, which accounts for $1.2 million," Torjusen said. "Another $200,000 in savings will be through restraint on travel and restraints in other areas, such as supplies."</p>
<p>That said, the RQHR isn't feeling the same financial pinch as the Sunrise Health Region.</p>
<p>"We're still working towards a balanced budget for this year," Torjusen said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Extreme change both challenge, opportunity; Economic recovery will see a number of shifts in society: speakers</b>
</div><div>Ray Turchansky   </div>
<div>For Canwest News Service</div>
<div>935 words</div><div>21 December 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>C13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The common thread among the half-dozen speakers at the recent Economics Society of Northern Alberta conference on recovery was that change is at hand in almost every aspect of our lives.</p>
<p>It may range from farmers raising bison and sheep as significant revenue sources, to cuts in government spending and increases in consumption taxes, to new technologies causing us to embrace solar and nuclear energy plus natural gas as primary power sources.</p>
<p>"We are in a period of extreme change, and it's not going away," said Peter Tertzakian, chief economist of ARC Financial, and author of books A Thousand Barrels a Second and The End of Energy Obesity. "There's always opportunity in change."</p>
<p>Therein lies the warning, and challenge, for investors. Those who seek and recognize future changes in how we live and work can prosper from them.</p>
<p>Tertzakian showed how energy conservation has evolved from an automatic candle snuffer that put out the flame after a candle burned down a certain length, to a box by Cisco Systems that continually adjusts energy needs for lighting, heating and powering machines throughout a building, cutting electricity consumption by 10 to 15 per cent.</p>
<p>During that stretch of history, we used ice blocks for refrigeration until machines were developed to do the job. We burned whale oil for lighting, and when whale stocks depleted we moved the processing "factories" from land onto the whaling ships to reduce oil deterioration. And we evolved from heating with coal gas to the use of stranded "nature's gas" when the innovation of pipeline welding allowed it to be transported great distances.</p>
<p>"The technologies that change the game are going to come from outside the energy complex, much as welding affected the fortunes of coal," said Tertzakian. "<span class="companylink">Google</span>, <span class="companylink">Cisco</span> and IBM are largely in the business of saving energy."</p>
<p>He noted that it was correctly predicted in 1966 that within five years more than 10 million colour TV sets would be sold annually, but there have been fewer than a half million hybrid cars sold in a single year since the Toyota Prius emerged in 1997.</p>
<p>"If (Apple founder) Steve Jobs was running that, he would have had some people fired."</p>
<p>Tertzakian said the problem is that two-thirds of all barrels of oil produced go to transportation, and it isn't until "around $85 a barrel when you start to get substitution, you start to get behavioural change, when people seek alternatives.</p>
<p>"And the free market is the most powerful thing to sort things out, within boundaries. The role of government is to set the boundaries. The most powerful changes have nothing to do with government incentives."</p>
<p>That dovetails with the message from Stewart Hall, an economist with HSBC Securities Canada.</p>
<p>"We need to hand off the public sector spending to the private sector at some point in time," said Hall.</p>
<p>He said there are huge profits to be made from other Canadian resources.</p>
<p>"India is set to import rice for the first time in a long period of time (20 years)," said Hall. "There are areas that are not water-rich, and I'm not talking lakes and rivers, I'm talking water in the ground, aquifers.</p>
<p>"Canada is very well-positioned to take advantage of this, because you can set up a virtual trade of water by exporting grain and rices to areas that are water-deficient. Some argue that the next <span class="companylink">Microsoft</span> is going to be agricultural engineering."</p>
<p>Don Brown, the director of economics and competitiveness with Alberta Agriculture, noted that the amount of total Canadian household spending that is on food and nonalcoholic beverages has dropped from 26 per cent in 1945 to 8.8 per cent currently.</p>
<p>He said Canada's share of world wheat trade is declining, beef is facing "one calamity after another," pork is suffering from high feed costs and the H1N1 flu, while Canadian consumption of poultry isn't rising as fast as in the United States.</p>
<p>The good news is that there's a growing demand for bison, as well as sheep breeding stock and market lambs.</p>
<p>"Never waste a crisis, never waste a disaster," Brown said. "That is a key requirement for attitude change."</p>
<p>Indeed, there is opportunity in diversification.</p>
<p>"We are limiting ourselves if we don't think of our provincial economy as something more than agriculture and conventional energy," said Todd Hirsch, senior economist with Alberta's ATB Financial.</p>
<p>"China's growth rate slipped from 12 per cent to six per cent in 2009; we did not lose China. It was a similar thing in India. A very interesting theme has developed, and that is the recovery is being led by developing nations, and we haven't really seen this in other global downturns. This time the U.S. is going to lag, and there's going to be a new leadership by China and India, and other developing economies, Indonesia and South Korea. They will lead the global recovery in 2010."</p>
<p>The legacy of this Great Recession, as some are calling it, will be change.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Great right hope; The Wildrose Alliance Party sees a future premier in Danielle Smith. That's a tall order</b>
</div><div>Sheila Pratt   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>3104 words</div><div>20 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>E1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>On a cool spring day in 2008, a curious Danielle Smith headed to a downtown restaurant in Calgary for a meeting with John Murdoch, an oilpatch veteran who runs a small oil-and-gas firm. Over lunch at the Wild Ginger, the two discussed the provincial election of a few weeks earlier, in which the Stelmach Tories took a massive 72-seat majority and defeated the only Wildrose MLA, but suffered losses to the Liberals in Calgary.</p>
<p>Smith had intended to run for the Tories in that March 2 vote in Calgary North Hill. She reminded Murdoch that she intended to do exactly that in 2012. Ambitious, articulate, and an up-and-comer in conservative circles, Smith was ready to go to the big show after working for a decade as a champion of conservative causes.</p>
<p>Murdoch had a different idea. The Stelmach Tories were in trouble, especially in downtown Calgary, he argued. The Wildrose Alliance had raised a stunning $513,000 in that 28-day campaign, almost as much as the Tories.</p>
<p>It was time for a change, said Murdoch, and Danielle Smith could be the next premier with a renewed party from the right.</p>
<p>It wasn't an instant sell. It took several lunches over many months before Smith was ready to make the biggest decision of her life. In late 2008, she rolled the dice. She'd take on the 40-</p>
<p>year Tory dynasty rather than work within it -- a mission decidedly not for the faint</p>
<p>of heart. "It was a long process to leave the Tory party," she explains in a recent interview in Edmonton. "But I realized what would happen if there was not a strong Wildrose party. Next time, Ed Stelmach would get 60 to 70 seats and pat himself on the back and carry on. So if we can offer a strong opposition, that would be a good outcome."</p>
<p>The political right has bigger ambitions for Danielle Smith than just a stronger opposition. Young, articulate and urban, she dispels the party's image as a rural rump of grumpy ideologues and social conservatives. She's from Calgary where the anger at Stelmach is still simmering, anger that gave the Wildrose its big break this fall -- an upset victory in the Calgary Glenmore byelection.</p>
<p>"She could be the first premier schooled in the neo-conservative school," says an excited Link Byfield, former publisher of Alberta Report, a now defunct weekly right-of-centre news magazine.</p>
<p>"She is also a real democrat and believes in the common sense of the common person," he says. "It's been 40 years (of Tory rule), and it's been too long."</p>
<p>It was only last year, in 2008, that Danielle Smith was running the six-person, local office of the Canadian Federal of Independent Business. The question now is whether she has the depth, political skills and acumen to be a giant killer. It's no small task to parlay a party with local organizations in only 40 of 83 constituencies and about seven per cent of the popular vote in 2008 into a government-in-waiting. But the Wildrose has cash in hand and another trump card at this point -- a wave of unrelenting frustration with the Stelmach government.</p>
<p>In many ways, Smith's grooming for the Wildrose leadership has been underway since her university days. After Prime Minister Stephen Harper, she's the second, proud graduate of the "Calgary school" -- a group of economists and political scientists at the University of Calgary devoted to free markets, small government, privatization, low taxes, the oil-and-gas sector and doubts about global warming.</p>
<p>Smith counts longtime Harper adviser Tom Flanagan as a major influence. Flanagan helped get her into Vancouver's Fraser Institute, a right-wing think-tank, in 1996. There she met her heroes, former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher and Michael Walker, then the institute's executive director. She studied under U of C economist Fred Atkins, Harper's thesis adviser, who describes himself as on the far right on economic policy.</p>
<p>There are of course many politicians from the "Calgary school" inside the famous Tory big tent; there always have been. Sustainable Resources Minister Ted Morton, also one of Smith's key mentors, comes to mind.</p>
<p>But, says Smith, Stelmach made two wrong moves that persuaded her it was time to leave.</p>
<p>With a ready smile and brimming with confidence, she plunks down a big handbag full of books and papers and settles in for an interview in a south-side Edmonton eatery. For the next 90 minutes, she talks almost nonstop about issues near and dear to her -- the plight of small oil companies, the new royalty rates ( "excessive and punitive"), decentralized democracy ( "great faith in local school boards"), carbon sequestration ( "sounds like a boondoggle"), Stelmach's spending ( "out of control"), and plans for new electricity-transmission lines ( "digging an irrigation canal to water the backyard") and converting cars to run on natural gas.</p>
<p>A quick study, Smith, 38, is a bit of a policy wonk. Quite a bit, actually. She absorbs facts and figures with ease and relays them with a conservative edge that astutely avoids an overtly ideological hue.</p>
<p>She's brims with ideas about energy conservation, new technology, and a new natural gas strategy, after reading The End of Energy Obesity, a look at the future by Calgary energy economist Peter Tertzakian.</p>
<p>Engaging and friendly, Smith also has a dogged side. She doesn't like to give up an argument.</p>
<p>So what were the Two Big Mistakes that persuaded her to leave the usual safety of Calgary's Tory club, with its almost certain path to power and influence?</p>
<p>First, the premier raised royalty rates. Then he raised spending 17 per cent in his first budget in April 2008.</p>
<p>"I was shocked when he raised spending like that," she says. "I was willing to give him the benefit of the doubt."</p>
<p>Smith firmly rejects the notion that Albertans were not getting their fair share of natural resource revenue before Stelmach's royalty review, which was released in October 2007.</p>
<p>"I don't hear people saying, 'I want my fair share.' I hear farmers complaining about not getting land access fees. Everyone is impacted. We were sold a bill of goods (in the royalty review). It was a fundamental mistake and we have to fix it."</p>
<p>"Punitive" royalty rates must go down, especially for junior oil and gas companies, among her biggest supporters. "They live and work in this community, and it's really a tragedy that this sector was hardest hit.</p>
<p>"You need to have incentives for drilling, and that's profit.</p>
<p>Smith is heavy on economic policy. The province's future lies in a vigorous oil-and-gas sector and a vigorous agriculture sector. Staking a future on nanotechnology or the knowledge economy is "silly" -- except when new technology can help the oil and gas industry, she says. On global warming, she's a skeptic, sort of, but says an energy-efficiency strategy is just basically a good idea.</p>
<p>On social policy, individuals are responsible for themselves. Government has a limited role.</p>
<p>"Individuals and non-profit groups are the first line of support for underprivileged Albertans," Smith says.</p>
<p>"We need to do more to ensure private charities and non-profits have the resources they need to continue to do their good work. Government's role is to make sure services are delivered, but it is not necessarily their job to deliver them."</p>
<p>Health care? The money follows the patient, like school vouchers. (As an editorial writer, she supported Klein's third-way, private-parallel system.)</p>
<p>Environment policy? Here Smith is vague, calling for "sustainable oil development" and new technology.</p>
<p>Smith was born in Calgary in 1971, the year Peter Lougheed's Tories chased the Social Credit dynasty from power. She cut her teeth politically in Preston Manning's Reform movement in the 1990s and worked for former MP Lee Richardson in Calgary. She also supported Rick Orman's bid in 1992 for the leadership of the provincial Tories, the race that Klein won.</p>
<p>In 1997, she returned from the Fraser Institute to set up the (now defunct) Canadian Property Rights Research Institute, an advocacy group for ranchers, farmers and other rural land owners -- key elements of the old and limited base of the Social Credit party. Later, in 2006, she helped launched the Alberta Property Rights Initiative, an organization with a similar cause.</p>
<p>But Albertas's right wing, it seems, is trying to reinvent itself these days. Smith leads a party that aims to be less blatantly ideological, less shrill and "more sensible" to the average voter.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, government was the problem and the less of it, the better. The mantra of the right was, "let the market prevail."</p>
<p>Now, says Byfield, taxpayers deserve "smart government" or "high-performance government" and "practical free enterprise." In fact, the new right isn't even necessarily anti-union, he says.</p>
<p>"Most people don't see government as the problem, but it's bad value for money," Byfield says. "The question is, what do you want to get done?</p>
<p>"Danielle is quite firm on this stuff and stays right on track without being inappropriately ideological about it."</p>
<p>As for social conservatism, that too is getting a revise. Social conservatives should not necessarily look to the state for moral underpinning for their causes, Byfield says. That only increases the power of the state over individuals, he says.</p>
<p>Smith, the second of five children, grew up in a boom-and-bust economy. In the 1980s, her</p>
<p>parents lost a home when oil prices collapsed. Her dad worked in a warehouse for years before getting into the oilpatch. She doesn't dwell on personal history.</p>
<p>After an English degree at the U of C, Smith went to Vancouver for a year to figure out her life. She worked in a restaurant and ran the local office of Encyclopaedia Britannica. She came back to Alberta to do an economics degree. In 1998, she ran for the Calgary public school board as a champion of charter schools. But that political venture was short-lived. The board was so politically divided it became dysfunctional, and education minister Lyle Oberg shut it down after 10 months.</p>
<p>In 1999, Smith went to work for the Calgary Herald editorial board, and became a television and talk-radio celebrity. She left journalism in 2006 to work for the CFIB. She's divorced and remarried.</p>
<p>Her big break came in September 2006, when Link Byfield asked her to chair the Calgary Congress, a forum of conservative thinkers, supported by the Manning Institute, that was looking to renew federalism and promote an elected Senate.</p>
<p>That's where she caught attention of John Murdoch.</p>
<p>"She's articulate and intelligent and she erased a lot of unfair branding of the party" as angry Albertans and social conservatives, he says. "She's a fiscal conservative and social moderate and that's what Albertans want."</p>
<p>That tension between the social conservatives and libertarians -- Smith considers herself part of the latter group -- is one of her biggest challenges. So far she mostly refuses to discuss "issues that divide," such as gay rights and abortion.</p>
<p>Murdoch himself is a disillusioned Tory. Originally a Klein supporter, he was briefly elected to the Calgary regional health board until Klein shut down that exercise in local democracy. In 2004, the day he got the phone call firing the elected board, he went to the founding convention of the Alliance Party, looking, he says, for a party that took democracy seriously, including referendum and recall.</p>
<p>There's plenty of upset at Calgary Tories in the oilpatch, especially among smaller oil producers, he adds, charging that new royalty rates drove investment to Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>"This place runs on Other People's Money and I think Stelmach has lost sight of that," Murdoch says.</p>
<p>"Most of us are working stiffs trying to put away money for retirement," says Murdoch, whose company consists these days of three people and wells producing 50 to 60 barrels a day.</p>
<p>Being "on-side" with the oilpatch is critical to the Wildrose Alliance or anyone who wants to lead Alberta because that's where Alberta's wealth comes from, says U of C economist Frank Atkins, also one of Smith's mentors.</p>
<p>Stelmach's biggest mistake was alienating the oilpatch, says Atkins.</p>
<p>"Stelmach did not understand the need to keep oil and gas on-side. If you anger oil and gas, you suffer economic wrath," he says.</p>
<p>While in principle he's not against raising royalty rates, Atkin says there's no point transferring private-sector wealth to the public sector if government just continues to spend wastefully.</p>
<p>Atkins describes himself as being on the far right on economic policy. He advised Harper last fall against getting into a stimulus package when the recession hit, and says there's little you can do about an overheated economy as well.</p>
<p>"If you're going to let the market work, you will have winners and losers, and you just have to put up with it," he says. "People just have to adjust. "</p>
<p>He's certain Smith shares that view.</p>
<p>Calgary political analyst Dave Taras agrees there is a "lot of anger in downtown Calgary looking for a place to go." The city is still simmering from the rise in royalty rates, the loss of Calgary's candidate in the Tory leadership race, the mishandling of the H1N1 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>Taras wonders if Smith is "mainly a Calgary play," though there's plenty of unhappiness in Edmonton, too, a recent poll indicates. In both cities, the Tories slipped to third place in an early December Angus Reid poll and the Wildrose is ahead of the Liberals.</p>
<p>In many ways, the oilpatch took over the empty shell of the Wildrose party as a vehicle, says Taras, who teaches communications at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>"She fits an image of change," he says. "She's very poised and has an excellent grasp of policy."</p>
<p>But Smith has to take Wildrose from a protest movement to a government-in-waiting and that won't be easy. The battleground with Stelmach will be over credibility and competence, he says.</p>
<p>People now seem to be deciding that Stelmach is a "nice guy but out of his depth," says Taras. That's the conclusion he draws from the December poll.</p>
<p>While there's plenty of buzz around Smith, she has yet to pass the credibility test herself. That will depend to a large extent on the team she attracts and whether she gets outside the narrow, right-wing circles of old Socreds and social conservatives.</p>
<p>"So the next move is critical: Does she get credible people around her?" says Taras. "Watch to see over the next six months if ambitious people move to her."</p>
<p>So far, she's got Dave Yager, a veteran oilpatch warrior, Link Byfield, a longtime advocate on the right, and David Gray, former executive director of the Alberta Utilities Consumer Advocate</p>
<p>Longtime Edmonton Tory Ken Chapman says change is in the air. But the Wildrose represents a return to "old school politics" at a time when disengaged, frustrated voters and non-voters are looking for something new, an alternative to Tory "command-and-control" party politics. Like Stelmach, Smith won't release her list of her donors, hardly advancing the cause of accountability and transparency. "That's just not good enough anymore," Chapman says.</p>
<p>Also, the Wildrose Alliance is mostly about an economic policy that's tied to conventional oil and gas, a sector that is declining, Chapman says. "She's smart. But we need to go some place else coming out of Copenhagen," said Chapman, adding that her party is light on environmental policy.</p>
<p>Alberta had one other highly successful premier who came from the ranks of journalism. But Ralph Klein ran the city of Calgary for six years before taking the leap into provincial politics. Smith has seven years in newspapers and television before running a local CFIB office. Experience? That's where her team comes in, she says.</p>
<p>John Murdoch also downplays Smith's lack of experience in running a big organization. "I don't think (Saskatchewan Premier) Brad Wall had much experience either," he says.</p>
<p>Byfield says the province is closer to the moment of change than at any time since Peter Lougheed defeated Social Credit. After the Wildrose Alliance won the Calgary byelection in September, "the attitude on the golf courses of Edmonton shifted overnight, " he adds.</p>
<p>Smith also acknowledges she may simply be dividing the provincial Conservatives, as the Reform did federally. But that doesn't bother her.</p>
<p>"We may be setting up the same pattern provincially. But that's OK," says Smith. "The PC party needs to be shaken up, but it can't be changed from within."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 reminds us of the importance of immunization programs</b>
</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div>

</p>
<p>Re: "H1N1 claims Calgary teen; Youth had no existing illness," The Journal, Dec. 17.</p>
<p>A 16-year-old was Alberta's 65th H1N1 death and it is a striking reminder of the importance of vaccines.</p>
<p>While more than 1.1 million Albertans have been vaccinated against H1N1, we should take a moment to remember the millions of parents who are forced by poverty to stand idle while their children die from easily preventable diseases for lack of access to basic and inexpensive immunizations.</p>
<p>Last month, the director general of the World Health Organization, Margaret Chen, made this comparison: "The H1N1 pandemic draws attention to the promise and dynamism of vaccine development today. Yet it also reminds us once again of the obstacles of bringing the benefits of science to people in the poorest nations."</p>
<p>According to a recent WHO report, vaccines are more readily available than ever and the impact has been profound. Measles deaths alone decreased by 74 per cent from 2000 to 2007. Moreover, the WHO reports that if all the vaccines now available against childhood diseases were widely adopted, an additional two million deaths a year could be prevented among children under five years by 2015.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Immunization Initiative (CIII) is a home grown Canadian initiative that has been a leader in ensuring the provision of basic immunizations to needy children in countries around the world. Right now, decisions are being made within CIDA that will determine whether or not CIII is renewed. It is critical that we act immediately to ensure this initiative continues to save lives. All parliamentarians and parties need to be aware of this program and provide support to ensure the CIII continues.</p>

<p>I recently heard that there are approximately 1.5 million Albertans, including the premier, who have not received the H1N1 flu shot</p>
<p>Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health with Alberta Health Services, has been seen many times on television asking people to get the shot. I don't think this flu has reached its peak yet. There are still a lot of winter months in which flu can break out at any time.</p>
<p>My wife and I received the seasonal and the H1N1 flu shots.</p>
<p>I urge all Albertans to get the shot to protect not only themselves but also for their loved ones. The province has said that the clinics will only be open for one more week. Come on, Albertans, let's get the H1N1 vaccination.</p>

</p>
<p>Credit Howie Mandel for summing up his life in six words: Here's the Deal - Don't Touch Me. The first three words are a reference to his hit TV game show Deal or No Deal; the latter three, to his germaphobia.</p>
<p>Here's the Deal - Don't Touch Me (Bantam; $29.95) is also the title of Mandel's surprisingly revealing bio, written by him and Josh Young. The book focuses on the Toronto-born Mandel's lifelong battle with OCD (obsessive-compulsive disorder) and ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder), which go a long way toward explaining the man's manic comic style, both on the chuckles and the game-show circuit. The accent here is much more on dysfunction than funny.</p>
<p>Howie Hughes had little over Howie Mandel - on the germaphobia front. Which triggered both their OCD conditions. Mandel was a mess before the swine-flu crisis. Can't imagine how he is faring now. Perhaps exchanging high-fives with his feet.</p>
<p>Although Mandel has been plagued with OCD all his life, his condition was made public only a decade back. And not quite in the manner Mandel the control-freak - there's another issue - would have liked. He was on Howard Stern's radio show, and already some can see a recipe for disaster brewing.</p>
<p>Turns out Mandel was sharing the spotlight on Stern's program with a fellow who had a special talent. Evidently, the guy had been endowed with a penis the size of a redwood, and to prove the point, he whipped it out. Mandel's first reaction was one of envy. But that was swiftly followed by one of panic. Seems the fellow, after doing something akin to baton exercises, didn't wash his hands and opened the door to leave the studio.</p>
<p>Mandel was frozen with fear. He couldn't bring himself to touch that doorknob when it was his turn to exit. He stayed trapped in the studio. The ever-sensitive Stern was amused. Mandel's only way out was to announce his OCD on air with Stern - not quite the optimum venue to reveal a serious psychological disorder.</p>
<p>It's a wonder Mandel, 54, is not living in a bubble. At the age of 4, he was keeping many of Toronto's medical professionals in business. He was allergic to dairy products, suffered from "seeping" eczema and constant ear infections, and was a bed-wetter - the result of his ADHD. And, oh yeah, he was a maniacal attention-seeker, which may account for his choice of career.</p>
<p>By the time he entered school, teachers feared he was somewhat slow, because he didn't tie his shoelaces when they got untied. But this had nothing to do with his pre-existing conditions - from lactose intolerance to seeping eczema. Mandel simply refused to touch his shoelaces after they were dragged through an array of germs in the classroom and schoolyard.</p>
<p>Naturally, when his parents took him away on vacation to Miami, a colony of sand flies decided to change residence from the beach to his legs, leading to many trips to the dermatologist.</p>
<p>So perhaps now you understand why Mandel won't shake hands with anyone. Evidently, he was somehow able to overcome his germaphobia in order to make babies with his wife, Terry, but it's safe to say few would want to know his modus operandi in that department.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, considering his quirks, Mandel got and lost many jobs as a teen and young man - everything from running rides at the Canadian National Exhibition to bingo-calling. Nor did it help that he never finished high school, let alone go to college. The best he could do was become a carpet salesman. Oh, and it should be mentioned that Mandel was colour-blind, too, which can negatively impact the task of selling carpets.</p>
<p>At an age when all his cronies were charting a path in life, Mandel wasn't charting and had no path. His only goal was to become a millionaire, and it didn't seem likely that the wonderful world of broadloom was going to bring him great riches.</p>
<p>Show-biz was the farthest thing from his mind as a young man. Mandel's idea of high comedy was Candid Camera. Really. Still, his friends thought he was funny, in spite of - or perhaps because of - his myriad disorders. They dragged him to a comedy club for an open mike night with amateurs who actually coveted a career in comedy.</p>
<p>And the rest is history. In Mandel's case, it was hysteria that had him leap into the limelight. This was not a subscriber to the Lenny Bruce/George Carlin school of comedy. Mandel was no one's notion of cerebral. He would get up on stage, often with a surgical - naturally - glove stretched out on his head or sporting a giant diaper, and enact his version of Tourette Syndrome in swearing a blue streak. Whatever. It obviously worked.</p>
<p>Mandel soon uprooted to Hollywood. He got major gigs in Vegas. He landed films and a starring role in the acclaimed TV drama St.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, playing - what else but - a doctor. He created the award-winning kiddie cartoon-series Bobby's World. He proved skeptics wrong again by striking gold in Deal or No Deal. And he's had to deal with a variety of maladies along the way.</p>
<p>It just may be that good health - mental and physical - is much over-rated. Purell, anyone?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cutback plan dropped overnight; Government says it will no longer cancel mentally ill patients' toiletries, snacks after Edmonton MLA contacts health minister</b>
</div><div>Archie McLean   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>551 words</div><div>20 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>A plan to save $70,000 a year by taking free toiletries and snacks away from mentally ill patients was overturned by the Alberta government Saturday in a hasty flurry of goodwill.</p>
<p>"Something like this only adds to the feelings of stress and uncertainty that both patients and families are feeling right now," Fred Horne, MLA for Edmonton-Rutherford, said about the new cost-saving measures at Alberta Hospital Edmonton.</p>
<p>"It will be rescinded immediately."</p>
<p>Horne first learned of the policy by reading Saturday's Journal. He then spoke by phone to Health Minister Ron Liepert, a member of the premier's office staff and finally Alberta Health Services president and CEO Stephen Duckett, who was asked to kill the plan.</p>
<p>The policy was supposed to save $70,000 for the government by eliminating free items such as toothbrushes, face soap, feminine hygiene products, razors and nail clippers, as well as coffee and snacks for patients who live at the hospital.</p>
<p>Critics blasted the idea as a petty and mean-spirited way to save money for the health department, which is facing a $1.2-billion deficit.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Alberta Health Services on Friday described the move as "part of aligning and standardizing our supplies across the province."</p>
<p>Horne is the premier's representative on a committee currently looking at how to implement the closure of 246 acute care beds at the hospital in northeast Edmonton. He expressed regret on behalf of the committee.</p>
<p>"We want patients and their families to know that they're at the centre of this process," Horne said.</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason said the flip-flop means the government is sensitive to recent polls showing their support falling across the province. He said the original policy was petty, small and unsurprising, given the government's approach to cutting spending.</p>
<p>The senior's ministry recently announced a $6-million clawback of funding to agencies that support people with developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>"They always turn on the most vulnerable among us," Mason said.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader David Swann said both the original policy and the hasty turnaround make the government look incompetent in the midst of major restricting of the health department.</p>
<p>"It's extremely embarrassing," Swann said. "The government was nickel-and-diming these people when they overspent for years."</p>
<p>Swann said the change of course raises questions about who is making policy, when a backbench MLA is able to reverse AHS policy with a few phone calls.</p>
<p>The Liberals have been calling all fall for Health Minister Ron Liepert to resign over his handling of the province's health reforms and the H1N1 vaccination program.</p>
<p>Austin Mardon, a prominent mental health patient activist who also has schizophrenia, applauded the government for acting so quickly to reverse the policy.</p>
<p>Mardon said little perks -- such as the toiletries and especially caffeine to counteract the sedative effects of some medication -- go a long way to help patients, many of whom are forced to live a the hospital.</p>
<p>"I know the government is under pressure to tighten its belt, but hopefully we can find another way," Mardon said.</p>

<p>Forget the H1N1 virus, there is a bigger epidemic in the National Hockey League called the OTL.</p>
<p>The OTL, or overtime loss, is the official designation for a team that drops a game in the extra period or shootout.</p>
<p>You can't win in 60 minutes, you can't win in overtime and you can't win in a shootout, but you still get a "loser point" for not losing in 60 minutes.</p>
<p>It's wacky and, heading into last night's action, a whopping 138 "loser points" had already been awarded this season.</p>
<p>Dallas led the way with 11, followed by Tampa with nine.</p>
<p>Last season, 282 points were awarded to teams that couldn't win.</p>
<p>Now, we have no problem with the "loser point" if the NHL deep thinkers feel playing someone even for 60 minutes is worth a reward.</p>
<p>Our problem is that some games are worth two points - that's for the old-fashioned victory in 60 minutes - and others are worth three when it goes beyond 60.</p>
<p>The obvious solution is to award three points for a regulation victory and make all games of equal value.</p>
<p>Traditionalists may scoff at the three-point solution, but what kind of tradition is it when 138 points are given to teams that lost?</p>
<p>The loser point has skewed the standings and the only way to counter it is to reward three points for a regulation victory.</p>
<p>Funny, when this theory was put to two team captains last weekend, it received no support.</p>
<p>We polled a Canadian, an American, a Finn and a retired goalie and nobody was buying our seemingly sensible solution.</p>
<p>"I don't mind the way it is," Canucks captain Roberto Luongo said. "Obviously, it's not in our favour right now and it's a little frustrating but, you know, that's the way it goes. We have to find a way, when we're down a goal, to bring games to overtime and take it from there.</p>
<p>"It's not helping us right now, but that's not the system's fault. That's our fault."</p>
<p>Wild captain Mikko Koivu, the Finn in our little poll, admitted he doesn't spend much time sweating this sort of stuff.</p>
<p>"I don't know about three points for a win, I haven't really thought about it," he said.</p>
<p>"I know in Europe they have three points, but I like the way it is here. If you get to the shootout, I think for sure you should get one point. Maybe if you lose in overtime, you shouldn't get any."</p>
<p>(Fat chance that would ever come to pass, Mikko, because coaches would order their players to sit back and protect the point through the overtime.)</p>
<p>Ryan Kesler, a Canucks centre and impending U.S. Olympian, wasn't the least bit interested in a three-point regulation victory.</p>
<p>"No," he replied emphatically. "That wouldn't work. That's too much like European soccer. Pretty soon, you're going to have 10 points for a win, then 15 points for a loss. I think it works the way it is now. It's hard to win games in the NHL. You battle hard for that one point, and I think you deserve it if you tie a game through 60 minutes."</p>
<p>The three-point win would actually add drama to the standings, not lessen it. If teams desperately needed an extra point to finish first or make the playoffs, they would go all-out in regulation rather than letting it get to OT or a shootout.</p>
<p>Kesler wasn't buying that, either.</p>
<p>"I just like it the way it is," he said. "Some teams are going to play a lot of games where they lose in overtime and might make the playoffs because of it. But they worked hard for 60 minutes to get that point."</p>
<p>Retired goalie Kevin Weekes, now a rookie commentator on Hockey Night in Canada, also endorsed the current system, but conceded that a three-point regulation victory is at least worthy of discussion.</p>
<p>"I think it's a little bit of a novel concept," Weekes said. "I think it always takes a lot of people in the hockey world to get their heads around something when it comes to change.</p>
<p>"One proposal I heard the other night with regards to the OT situation is maybe go 4-on-4, 3-on-3, 2-on-2, then 1-on-1. I think that's pretty neat. I think that's exciting. Not to suggest that the shootout isn't exciting, but I think in this instance teams would play harder and it's a more natural way for teams to try to get that point."</p>
<p>We'll vote that one down and stick to our guns: three points for a regulation win, two points for an overtime or shootout win, one point for an OTL.</p>
<p>In our world, all games are created equal.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Latest poll backs government handling of H1N1 vaccinations</b>
</div><div>Allison Jones   </div>
<div>THE CANADIAN PRESS</div>
<div>376 words</div><div>20 December 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Canadians think governments at all three levels have done an okay job of handling the H1N1 pandemic, although many also think the risk was exaggerated, a new poll suggests.</p>
<p>The Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll suggests that, as concern wanes among Canadians, they generally are satisfied with how governments responded.</p>
<p>Nearly three-quarters (73 per cent) of respondents assessed Ottawa's performance as good or fair; numbers were similar at the provincial and municipal levels. That's up from 61 per cent last month, when there were distribution challenges with the vaccine and lineups at clinics were hours long.</p>
<p>"It struck me that some of the things that were most likely to be causing people a problem at the last time that we asked had been taken care of," said Doug Anderson, Harris-Decima senior vice-president.</p>
<p>Provincially, the biggest change was 41 per cent of respondents in Alberta, saying their government was handling H1N1 poorly, as opposed to 61 per cent one month ago, when controversy had erupted over Calgary Flames players and their families getting the vaccine when others found it difficult to get.</p>
<p>Now, many clinics have closed and the rate of new infections seems to be dropping, based on hospitalizations, with declines reported in all provinces and territories.</p>
<p>Among those surveyed, just 9 per cent said they were very concerned about H1N1, down from 11 per cent two weeks ago and 22 per cent three weeks before that.</p>
<p>The survey found most who responded either had had the inoculation already or had decided not to, leaving 12 per cent who said they still intend to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The telephone survey of about 1,000 Canadians was conducted Dec. 10 to 13. It has a margin of error of 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>Days after the survey, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, warned against complacency, saying a third wave could come in the new year.</p>
<p>The survey suggests most Canadians have made up their minds about the vaccine; 40 per cent of respondents received the shot and 45 per cent said they would not get it.</p>

<p>It's official</p>
<p>Reality-TV stars Jon and Kate Gosselin, more famous this year for marital discord than the family harmony their show was supposedly about, were officially divorced. Aside from deciding who would look after the eight children, the consequences for their showbiz endeavours are sure to keep people talking.</p>
<p>Got the shot? Not so much</p>
<p>Despite a huge public awareness campaign and long lineups to get a shot of H1N1 vaccine, only 35 per cent of Manitobans have done so. This is on par with the percentage in other provinces, but Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, would like to see everyone get the shot. "At this time of year, when people are indoors and meeting new people, it's even more important to get vaccinated."</p>
<p>He scores... a spot on the team</p>
<p>Travis Hamonic got a golden opportunity to show what he can do when he was the lone Manitoban picked for Team Canada at the World Junior Hockey Championship that begins Dec. 26 in Saskatoon. The 19-year-old defenceman was passed over for the spot last year, but caught the attention of Team Canada's head scout Al Murray: "Travis can do so many things. He can be a shutdown guy, a combination of an offensive-defensive guy and he's shown the ability to be one of our power-play guys." Could be one to watch.</p>
<p>A Gaiman island</p>
<p>As in Neil Gaiman, famed fantasist and acclaimed writer of books such as American Gods, the Sandman series, and Coraline. The British author, who now lives in St. Paul, Minn., spoke to fans and signed books at McNally Robinson Polo Park, which had won a North American-wide contest to attract him here. Six hundred people turned up, with no advertising for the event. Winnipeggers like to read -- who's next?</p>
<p>Nice ice, baby</p>
<p>Well we're always aiming to beat Ottawa with our longest skating rink in Canada, but this year river rink guru Paul Jordon plans to make the skating smoother. Using a technique for building winter roads up north, Jordan will use water pumps to deal with slushy frazil ice on the Assiniboine River. Lace up your skates!</p>
<p>Is there no decency?</p>
<p>Ah, the Internet: boon to society or instrument of evil? It depends. Aside from a survey that found many teens were searching for porn online, it seems the Liberal Party of Canada needs to keep a closer watch at what gets posted on its website. A third-party image showing Prim Minister Stephen Harper getting shot (his face in place of Lee Harvey Oswald's) did not leave the Torries amused.</p>
<p>Play ball</p>
<p>After the long ordeal that Gordon Bell High School went through to get a little green space added to its grounds, it seemed it was moot at best. The area they got would be too small for a sports field. But it came to light, thanks to University of WInnipeg cartographer Prof. Weldon Hiebert, that if you place the lines just right (and close a side street), a football field works just fine.</p>

</p>
<p>You might be forgiven for thinking the vaccine was a new invention after witnessing the fuss over the H1N1 immunization campaign this fall.</p>
<p>People agonized over whether or not to get it, consulted friends, neighbours and the Internet and talked about it endlessly.</p>
<p>In the end, close to 47 per cent of Ottawa residents lined up to get jabbed, which is significantly more than get an annual flu shot. Fussing aside, the H1N1 vaccine campaign has been, and continues to be, a success.</p>
<p>That is good. What is better is that the campaign might have reminded those of us lucky enough to be able to take vaccines for granted what modern miracles they are. Vaccines have changed the world. And they continue to do so.</p>
<p>Vaccines are so much a part of the way we do things in Canada that most of us give them very little thought once our children are beyond the childhood immunization stage -- which might explain the out-of-proportion concerns about the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine campaign is not over yet and federal chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones is warning Canadians who are not yet immunized not to get complacent.</p>
<p>But all our recent focus on this particular vaccine might give Canadians a renewed appreciation for what vaccines have done for us and can do for us in the future.</p>
<p>And, more importantly, what they can do for people in parts of the world who don't have the luxury of being complacent about public health.</p>
<p>Just last week, World Health Organization officials began a campaign to immunize 2.8 million Afghan children under the age of five against polio, a disease that has largely disappeared in Canada but that continues to plague some of the poorest countries in the world.</p>
<p>The new vaccine is expected to be used on tens of millions of children in India and Nigeria by early next year. International health officials have been working since the late 1980s to eradicate polio, which a few countries have been unable to shake. The oral vaccine that immunizes against several strains of the disease makes that goal possible.</p>
<p>In Uganda, trials are about to begin on a new experimental tuberculosis vaccine -- the first new one to be developed in almost 100 years. The old one is not very effective anymore and tuberculosis is a growing international scourge that kills one person every 20 seconds.</p>
<p>And work continues, slowly, on the development of an AIDS vaccine. In September, there was excitement over the results of a vaccine trial that seemed to offer some protection against the disease, but that has since been tempered.</p>
<p>An effective vaccine is likely still years away.</p>
<p>There are many ways to prevent people from succumbing to deadly diseases, some of them simple.</p>
<p>Mosquito nets significantly reduce malaria deaths, condoms significantly reduce AIDS transmission, drugs successfully control many diseases.</p>
<p>But in poor and especially war-torn parts of the world, disease alleviation through drugs and other means is often difficult or impossible. And conditions make people more susceptible to illness.</p>
<p>That is where vaccines can have the biggest impact.</p>
<p>Which is why the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among other organizations, has made vaccine development and access in the developing world a priority.</p>
<p>Almost three years ago, Prime Minister Stephen Harper held a press conference with Bill Gates to announce funding support for the global effort to develop an AIDS vaccine. It is good to see the federal support for the initiative.</p>
<p>But Canada can do more. Even as health officials mull over what should be done with the excess doses of H1N1 vaccine stockpiled around the country, Canada has yet to commit to giving extra vaccine to developing countries.</p>
<p>The government now says a decision will be made early in the new year.</p>
<p>Canada's seeming reluctance to share its excess flu vaccine, as other countries have done, is depressing, especially at a time when Canadians have been reminded of the extraordinary power of vaccines.</p>

<p>You've trained yourself to</p>
<p>remember the cloth bags when</p>
<p>you get groceries. You caulked</p>
<p>all your windows. All your light</p>
<p>bulbs are compact fluorescents. You</p>
<p>at least feel a twinge of guilt about the</p>
<p>carbon emissions from your flight to</p>
<p>Cancun.</p>
<p>But without a binding</p>
<p>agreement in Copenhagen</p>
<p>and Canada's</p>
<p>green reputation in</p>
<p>tatters, it's time to take</p>
<p>the next few baby steps.</p>
<p>In the build-up to the</p>
<p>United Nations Climate</p>
<p>Change Conference,</p>
<p>there was chatter that, for all our noble</p>
<p>intentions, individual actions will never</p>
<p>be enough to forestall catastrophic</p>
<p>global warming. What's needed is a</p>
<p>coordinated government crackdown on</p>
<p>polluters.</p>
<p>But, according to Statistics Canada,</p>
<p>direct and indirect household emissions</p>
<p>account for 46 per cent of Canada's total</p>
<p>greenhouse gas output, a fact noted by</p>
<p>proponents of individual action.</p>
<p>"We need both streams complimenting</p>
<p>each other," said Adria Vasil, author of</p>
<p>Ecoholic Home and a green columnist</p>
<p>for Toronto's Now Magazine. "We need</p>
<p>government clamping down on big emitters,</p>
<p>but we also need to clamp down on</p>
<p>ourselves."</p>
<p>If lobbying for a new wind farm or a</p>
<p>continent-wide cap and trade system is</p>
<p>beyond your ken, and you're not quite</p>
<p>ready to spend $15,000 installing a</p>
<p>geothermal heat system, here are four</p>
<p>simple things you can do in 2010 that</p>
<p>don't require endless trips to Rona, a</p>
<p>weekend of work or a bajillion dollars.</p>
<p>UNPLUG EVERYTHING</p>
<p>Your cable set-top box can suck</p>
<p>up more power than your fridge,</p>
<p>even when you're not watching</p>
<p>television. Startling, eh?</p>
<p>It's called phantom load</p>
<p>-- the power drawn by</p>
<p>household gadgets even</p>
<p>when you think they're</p>
<p>turned off. That's</p>
<p>pretty much everything</p>
<p>that can be</p>
<p>turned on with a remote</p>
<p>or that has an</p>
<p>internal clock. And</p>
<p>it's your pile of cell</p>
<p>phone chargers,</p>
<p>Ipod chargers,</p>
<p>battery chargers</p>
<p>and laptop cords</p>
<p>that leach power</p>
<p>constantly if they're</p>
<p>plugged in. It's also</p>
<p>video game consoles</p>
<p>like the Wii and</p>
<p>Xbox. Some of those</p>
<p>consume 185 watts of</p>
<p>power when they're</p>
<p>just junked up under</p>
<p>the TV.</p>
<p>Phantom load accounts</p>
<p>for between five and 10 per</p>
<p>cent of all the power used by the</p>
<p>average household, says Tracy Moroz,</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span>'s residential programs marketing</p>
<p>specialist.</p>
<p>Granted, Manitoba's power is pretty green</p>
<p>since it's produced by water not coal or natural</p>
<p>gas. But because the province's power rates</p>
<p>are so cheap, Manitobans aren't great at conservation.</p>
<p>The more power Manitobans save,</p>
<p>the more green power is available for export,</p>
<p>which offsets the need for coal or natural gas</p>
<p>plants in the United States.</p>
<p>Moroz has a list of easy to-dos that will</p>
<p>actually save you money.</p>
<p>. Walk around the house and unplug every</p>
<p>charger, appliance and electronic gadget that's</p>
<p>not in frequent use.</p>
<p>. Next time you buy a new appliance, don't</p>
<p>just look for the Energy Star rating but also</p>
<p>ask yourself whether you need all the bells and</p>
<p>whistles like timers and remote controls. Most</p>
<p>kitchens suffer from digital clock overkill --</p>
<p>there's one on the stove, the microwave and the</p>
<p>coffee maker. Keeping appliances simple saves</p>
<p>phantom power.</p>
<p>. Get yourself some power bars. It's annoying</p>
<p>to rustle around behind the television looking</p>
<p>for the dusty plug every time you want to</p>
<p>watch Entertainment Tonight, so the best thing</p>
<p>to do is plug all your TV gadgets into a power</p>
<p>bar that's easy to switch on and off. Same with</p>
<p>computers and printers that don't get used all</p>
<p>the time.</p>
<p>Set top boxes are a lingering puzzle. Unplugging</p>
<p>them usually means losing all your channel</p>
<p>preferences. <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> and other</p>
<p>power companies are working with manufacturers</p>
<p>and cable companies on set top boxes</p>
<p>that could one day use just one watt of power</p>
<p>instead of the 45 watts some of them suck right</p>
<p>now.</p>
<p>BE A SEMI-VEGETARIAN</p>
<p>If the 100-mile diet is out because you just</p>
<p>can't get through a Winnipeg winter without</p>
<p>coffee, chocolate and wine, there are still tons</p>
<p>of ways to eat more sustainably.</p>
<p>A vegetarian diet is ideal, but Vasil says even</p>
<p>reducing the amount of meat you eat -- think</p>
<p>Meatless Mondays and Tofu Tuesdays -- can</p>
<p>make a difference.</p>
<p>Eating less beef is a start. Manitoba's hog</p>
<p>farmers, often criticized for huge factory</p>
<p>farms and stinky sewage lagoons, will be</p>
<p>glad to hear that pork has about a quarter the</p>
<p>carbon footprint of beef, largely because of the</p>
<p>methane produced by cow farts and the fertilizer</p>
<p>needed for grazing.</p>
<p>Even better is free-range chicken, and even</p>
<p>better than that is supporting small, local</p>
<p>organic producers, many of whom sell their</p>
<p>products at local independent butchers.</p>
<p>"We just ordered a quarter of a bison and a</p>
<p>large local turkey for our Christmas dinner,"</p>
<p>said Kreesta Doucette, executive director of</p>
<p>Food Matters Manitoba. "If you have the time,</p>
<p>connect with a local farmer."</p>
<p>Same with vegetables. Try to buy what's in</p>
<p>season locally instead of vegetables trucked in</p>
<p>from afar.</p>
<p>"See if it's made in Manitoba and if it doesn't</p>
<p>say, ask," said Doucette.</p>
<p>But Vasil points out one exception to the</p>
<p>"buy local" mantra. Greenhouses suck up</p>
<p>incredible amounts of energy, so the organic</p>
<p>tomato trucked up from Mexico might actually</p>
<p>be a greener bet than one grown in a greenhouse.</p>
<p>TAKE THE BUS ONCE A WEEK</p>
<p>Winnipeggers love to complain</p>
<p>about the transit system. The buses are</p>
<p>old, the routes into far-flung suburbs are</p>
<p>spotty, there's no rapid transit system and</p>
<p>someone with H1N1 might cough on you.</p>
<p>But experts say taking public transit or</p>
<p>biking to work is the single best thing you</p>
<p>can do for the environment.</p>
<p>If you suck it up, put on your longjohns,</p>
<p>pop on your Ipod and take the bus just one</p>
<p>day a week, you could be saving at least 123</p>
<p>kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions a</p>
<p>year.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Canada, the average</p>
<p>commute in Winnipeg is 6.1 kilometres.</p>
<p>Even if you left your very fuel efficient</p>
<p>2009 Toyota Corolla at home once a week,</p>
<p>you would still save about 2.45 kilograms of</p>
<p>CO2 emissions a day, according to the U.S.</p>
<p>Federal Transit Administration's carbon</p>
<p>calculator.</p>
<p>That would also save you about $35 a year</p>
<p>in gas, which would help offset the cost of</p>
<p>bus fare.</p>
<p>PURGE THE PACKAGING</p>
<p>Everyone who has tried to break into a</p>
<p>new batch of razors or batteries has cursed</p>
<p>the layers and layers of hard plastic packaging.</p>
<p>Vasil suggests making a grand statement</p>
<p>by leaving the bulky packaging at the</p>
<p>grocery store till when you check out or</p>
<p>mailing it to politicians. If you're too shy to</p>
<p>do that, try this:</p>
<p>. Steer-clear of prewashed veggies like the</p>
<p>tubs of lettuce or the bags of salad. Veggies</p>
<p>from the shelf are greener and cheaper, especially</p>
<p>if you can get away without using</p>
<p>one of those flimsy plastic bags.</p>
<p>. Do it <span class="companylink">Costco</span>-style, if you can. Buy a huge</p>
<p>tub of peanut butter or one mega-box of</p>
<p>cereal instead of lots of smaller ones. But</p>
<p>make sure the bulk versions really do have</p>
<p>less packaging. There's nothing worse</p>
<p>than realizing each of the soaps in your</p>
<p>four-pack comes in its own box, wrapped</p>
<p>together in paper and then plastic shrinkwrapped.</p>
<p>And, when buying big plastic containers,</p>
<p>make sure they have the recycling</p>
<p>triangle stamped on the bottom so they can</p>
<p>go in the Blue Box.</p>
<p>. Next time you go to Rae and Jerry's, bring</p>
<p>your own <span class="companylink">Tupperware</span> for the leftover onion</p>
<p>rings instead of taking the disposable containers.</p>
<p>As an experiment, Vasil once sent</p>
<p>an intern to all the big fast-food joints to</p>
<p>test whether they'd use the interns plastic</p>
<p>containers for take-out.</p>
<p>"None of them flinched," said Vasil.</p>
<p>"They just said 'OK' and filled it up."</p>

<p>Granted, Manitoba's power is pretty green since it's produced by water not coal or natural gas. But because the province's power rates are so cheap, Manitobans aren't great at conservation. The more power Manitobans save, the more green power is available for export, which offsets the need for coal or natural gas plants in the United States.</p>
<p>Moroz has a list of easy to-dos that will actually save you money.</p>
<p>Walk around the house and unplug every charger, appliance and electronic gadget that's not in frequent use.</p>
<p>Next time you buy a new appliance, don't just look for the Energy Star rating but also ask yourself whether you need all the bells and whistles like timers and remote controls. Most kitchens suffer from digital clock overkill -- there's one on the stove, the microwave and the coffee maker. Keeping appliances simple saves phantom power.</p>
<p>Get yourself some power bars. It's annoying to rustle around behind the television looking for the dusty plug every time you want to watch Entertainment Tonight, so the best thing to do is plug all your TV gadgets into a power bar that's easy to switch on and off. Same with computers and printers that don't get used all the time.</p>
<p>Set top boxes are a lingering puzzle. Unplugging them usually means losing all your channel preferences. <span class="companylink">Manitoba Hydro</span> and other power companies are working with manufacturers and cable companies on set top boxes that could one day use just one watt of power instead of the 45 watts some of them suck right now.</p>
<p>Be a semi-vegetarian</p>
<p>If the 100-mile diet is out because you just can't get through a Winnipeg winter without coffee, chocolate and wine, there are still tons of ways to eat more sustainably.</p>
<p>A vegetarian diet is ideal, but Vasil says even reducing the amount of meat you eat -- think Meatless Mondays and Tofu Tuesdays -- can make a difference.</p>
<p>Eating less beef is a start. Manitoba's hog farmers, often criticized for huge factory farms and stinky sewage lagoons, will be glad to hear that pork has about a quarter the carbon footprint of beef, largely because of the methane produced by cow farts and the fertilizer needed for grazing.</p>
<p>Even better is free-range chicken, and even better than that is supporting small, local organic producers, many of whom sell their products at local independent butchers.</p>
<p>"We just ordered a quarter of a bison and a large local turkey for our Christmas dinner," said Kreesta Doucette, executive director of Food Matters Manitoba. "If you have the time, connect with a local farmer."</p>
<p>Same with vegetables. Try to buy what's in season locally instead of vegetables trucked in from afar.</p>
<p>"See if it's made in Manitoba and if it doesn't say, ask," said Doucette.</p>
<p>But Vasil points out one exception to the "buy local" mantra. Greenhouses suck up incredible amounts of energy, so the organic tomato trucked up from Mexico might actually be a greener bet than one grown in a greenhouse.</p>
<p>Take the bus once a week</p>
<p>Winnipeggers love to complain about the transit system. The buses are old, the routes into far-flung suburbs are spotty, there's no rapid transit system and someone with H1N1 might cough on you.</p>
<p>But experts say taking public transit or biking to work is the single best thing you can do for the environment.</p>
<p>If you suck it up, put on your longjohns, pop on your Ipod and take the bus just one day a week, you could be saving at least 123 kilograms of greenhouse gas emissions a year.</p>
<p>According to Statistics Canada, the average commute in Winnipeg is 6.1 kilometres. Even if you left your very fuel efficient 2009 Toyota Corolla at home once a week, you would still save about 2.45 kilograms of CO2 emissions a day, according to the U.S. Federal Transit Administration's carbon calculator.</p>
<p>That would also save you about $35 a year in gas, which would help offset the cost of bus fare.</p>
<p>Purge the packaging</p>
<p>Everyone who has tried to break into a new batch of razors or batteries has cursed the layers and layers of hard plastic packaging.</p>
<p>Vasil suggests making a grand statement by leaving the bulky packaging at the grocery store till when you check out or mailing it to politicians. If you're too shy to do that, try this:</p>
<p>Steer-clear of prewashed veggies like the tubs of lettuce or the bags of salad. Veggies from the shelf are greener and cheaper, especially if you can get away without using one of those flimsy plastic bags.</p>
<p>Do it <span class="companylink">Costco</span>-style, if you can. Buy a huge tub of peanut butter or one mega-box of cereal instead of lots of smaller ones. But make sure the bulk versions really do have less packaging. There's nothing worse than realizing each of the soaps in your four-pack comes in its own box, wrapped together in paper and then plastic shrink-wrapped. And, when buying big plastic containers, make sure they have the recycling triangle stamped on the bottom so they can go in the Blue Box.</p>
<p>Next time you go to Rae and Jerry's, bring your own <span class="companylink">Tupperware</span> for the leftover onion rings instead of taking the disposable containers. As an experiment, Vasil once sent an intern to all the big fast-food joints to test whether they'd use the interns plastic containers for take-out.</p>
<p>"None of them flinched," said Vasil. "They just said 'OK' and filled it up."</p>

</p>
<p>DOLPHINS AT TITANS</p>
<p>Line: Titans by three</p>
<p>Tennessee has won six of seven to get in the playoff chase and hopes to have QB Vince Young back from a hamstring injury he suffered last week. If he can't go, it will be Kerry Collins handing off to NFL rushing leader Chris Johnson, who operates vs. the league's 13th-ranked run defence. Miami QB Chad Henne has completed 61.7 per cent of his passes in victories over New England and Jacksonville the last two games.</p>
<p>Titans 26 Dolphins 16</p>
<p>PATRIOTS AT BILLS</p>
<p>Line: Patriots by 7-1/2</p>
<p>New England has been sputtering but gets its favourite foe here, as the Patriots have beaten Buffalo 12 straight times. Look for Pats QB Tom Brady to target Randy Moss, who has been criticized by foes as a quitter, early in this one, then try to establish a ground game vs. the NFL's worst run defence. Also look for Bills QB Ryan Fitzpatrick to try to open up the passing game, because New England's pass defence has been woeful on the road, a good reason the team is 1-5 away from home.</p>
<p>Patriots 27 Bills 23</p>
<p>CARDINALS AT LIONS</p>
<p>Line: Cardinals by 12-1/2</p>
<p>Arizona tries to bounce back from its atrocious, seven-turnover outing Monday in San Francisco and clinches the NFC West title if it wins and the 49ers fall in Philadelphia. The Cards expect to have leading WR Larry Fitzgerald back from leg injuries he suffered last week to face the NFL's worst pass defence. Even if he's out, look for QB Kurt Warner to exploit that unit. Detroit is minus top RB Kevin Smith, who suffered a season-ending knee injury last week, and probably will be without QB Matthew Stafford (shoulder), meaning Daunte Culpepper would start again.</p>
<p>Cardinals 27 Lions 13.</p>
<p>49ERS AT EAGLES</p>
<p>Line: Eagles by 8-1/2</p>
<p>Philadelphia goes for its fifth straight victory as it's on the verge of a playoff slot and WR DeSean Jackson is the biggest threat, with eight TDs of 50 yards or more. Fellow WR Jeremy Maclin (foot) is out, but fellow WR Kevin Curtis might be back from a knee ailment that has sidelined him most of the year. RB Brian Westbrook (concussion) also is out. The 49ers have lost five in a row on the road. RB Frank Gore is coming off a big game but faces the NFL's 10th-rated run defence.</p>
<p>Eagles 26 49ers 20</p>
<p>FALCONS AT JETS</p>
<p>Line: Jets by 5-1/2</p>
<p>Injuries remain a key concern to Atlanta, which might again be minus QB Matt Ryan (toe) and RB Michael Turner (ankle), not a good sign for a team that's 1-5 on the road. NY expects to have QB Mark Sanchez back from a knee injury that sidelined him last week. The key will be how RB Thomas Jones (11 TDs, 4.4 per carry) fares vs. a defence that is 23rd vs. the run but has allowed only about 90 yards a game in its last four outings.</p>
<p>Jets 23 Falcons 20</p>
<p>BROWNS AT CHIEFS</p>
<p>Line: Chiefs by two</p>
<p>Yuk. Two of the worst teams in the NFL meet. Kansas City gets back WR Dwayne Bowe from a four-game suspension. Chiefs RB Jamaal Charles, coming off a 143-yard outing, faces the No. 29 run defence. Cleveland upset Pittsburgh in its last outing but is 1-6 on the road and its offence is woeful. Flip a coin.</p>
<p>Chiefs 17 Browns 13</p>
<p>TEXANS AT RAMS</p>
<p>Line: Texans by 12</p>
<p>The Rams were battling swine flu late in the week (insert punchline here for a one-win team). Rookie QB Keith Null probably will get his second start and key RB Steven Jackson might be out because of illness. The key here is Houston's offence. Matt Schaub, who has thrown for a team-record 3,814 yards, faces a defence allowing 27 points per game, 30th in the league. It's hard to see the depleted Rams, who manage just 11.2 ppg (worst in the NFL) keeping pace.</p>
<p>Texans 30 Rams 13</p>
<p>BENGALS AT CHARGERS</p>
<p>Line: Chargers by seven</p>
<p>Cincinnati will try to focus just three days after WR Chris Henry died, and the players will wear patches with his number (15). The Bengals will try to wrap up the AFC North title but face a team that's won eight in a row and clinches a playoff spot if it wins. San Diego is fifth in passing but Cincy is decent (12th) in pass defence. The Bengals will pound RB Cedric Benson at the 21st-rated run defence.</p>
<p>Chargers 24 Bengals 20</p>
<p>RAIDERS AT BRONCOS</p>
<p>Line: Broncos by 14</p>
<p>Denver tries to rebound from a loss at Indy, and with its RB corps banged up, expect more work for WR Brandon Marshall, who recorded 21 catches last week (NFL record), as Oakland is in the middle of the pack (17th) vs. the pass. The Raiders turn to journeyman QB Charlie Frye because Bruce Gradkowski is out (knee ailments) and former No. 1 pick JaMarcus Russell has been a huge bust.</p>
<p>Broncos 23 Raiders 10</p>
<p>BUCCANEERS AT SEAHAWKS</p>
<p>Line: Seahawks by 6-1/2</p>
<p>Seattle was blown out at Houston last week but now comes home to face a foe that's 0-6 on the road, has lost 16 of its last 17 outings overall, the offence has a grand total of nine points in its last two contests, and rookie QB Josh Freeman is struggling. Seattle hasn't protected QB Matt Hasselbeck, and Tampa despite its woes is seventh vs. the pass. That would behoove the Seahawks to turn to the ground -- the Bucs have the NFL's second-worst run defence.</p>
<p>Seahawks 23 Buccaneers 13</p>
<p>PACKERS AT STEELERS</p>
<p>Line: Steelers by two</p>
<p>The Steelers come off a shocking loss at Cleveland, where Ben Roethlisberger was sacked seven times, and try to avoid their first six-game losing streak in a decade. Roethlisberger might be under the gun again because Chris Kemoeatu is injured and out. The Steelers' pass defence isn't the same without safety Troy Polamalu, who is out again (knee), although it is No. 1 vs. the run. Green Bay has the NFL's second-ranked run defence and QB Aaron Rodgers is clicking.</p>
<p>Packers 23 Steelers 20</p>
<p>BEARS AT RAVENS</p>
<p>Line: Ravens by 11</p>
<p>Expect Baltimore to pound Ray Rice, who ran for 166 yards last week vs. Detroit, at the Chicago defence that ranks 24th vs. the run. The Bears are beaten up and done, are 1-5 on the road -- where they're against a team that's won 12 of its last 13 home games vs. the NFC.</p>
<p>Ravens 24 Bears 16</p>
<p>VIKINGS AT PANTHERS</p>
<p>Line: Vikings by nine</p>
<p>Vikings QB Brett Favre is sputtering a bit (three interceptions in each of his last two outings). He was without WR Percy Harvin last week but Harvin could be back from migraines. Carolina QB Matt Moore is expected to make his third start (Jake Delhomme has a broken finger). The Panthers love to run, but the Vikes are No. 4 in the league in rush defence.</p>
<p>Vikings 23 Panthers 16</p>
<p>GIANTS AT REDSKINS</p>
<p>Line: Giants by three</p>
<p>N.Y. has fizzled, losing six of eight, allowing 32 points per outing in the stretch and faces a team that was anemic offensively until recently. The Redskins have averaged nearly 30 points in its last three games as QB Jason Campbell has improved. The Giants love to throw (No. 8 in the NFL), but Washington is fourth at defending the pass.</p>
<p>Redskins 24 Giants 23</p>
<p>RECORD</p>

<p>Season: 137-71</p>
<p>VS. POINT SPREAD:</p>
<p>Last week: 8-8</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Holiday etiquette; Regift, buy in bulk, skip the hug for a fistbump. Welcome to recessionary, germfree manners</b>
</div><div>Julie Blais   </div>

<div>1280 words</div><div>19 December 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>G2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Before you start making that list, checking it twice, signing your cards and buying gifts for your children's teachers, take etiquette expert Julie Blais Comeau's holiday quiz. Give your gut responses for each of the scenarios below, then read on to learn what to do for appropriate seasonal celebrating.</p>
<p>1. You exchange gifts with your best friend during a holiday drink. She presents you with a DVD of Julie & Julia. One of your colleagues gave you a copy the week before. You know your sister-in-law loved the movie. You simply change the tag and re-gift it. Is re-gifting acceptable?</p>
<p>2. Your son's hockey coach gives you a holiday-cheer invitation for Saturday night after your son's game. The invitation has yours and your spouse's names on it. Do you assume your children are also invited?</p>
<p>3. January marks the one-year anniversary in your current position. Your boss is amazing, makes work fun, and always has time for you. He is a wine connoisseur and an avid golfer. On the last day of work before your holiday break, you show your gratitude by offering a 2007 Mike Weir Pinot Noir. You feel good about your choice: You are encouraging Canadian wine-makers and proceeds from the sale of the wine will go to the Mike Weir Foundation. Is your gift appropriate?</p>
<p>4. It is Dec. 23 and, after a long last day before your vacation, you click your garage-door opener and pull up the driveway as your neighbour walks up to your car with gift in hand. She informs you that she and her family are leaving to spend the holidays on a beach in Cuba. You need not worry about their home, as her brother and his girlfriend will be there to care for their dog and plants. She hands you the gift bag and offers you her best wishes. You thank her gratefully, wish her a wonderful trip, season's greeting and send her a thank-you note without reciprocating a gift. Is this a good-neighbour policy?</p>
<p>5. Financially, it has been a difficult year and you can't afford to give even a token gift to a service provider. Can you forgo gifts this year?</p>
<p>6. Your gift list for your children's teachers, day-care workers and coaches could make up a baker's dozen. This year, you decide to be efficient and make the trip on your own to buy, in bulk, one gender-neutral gift in a variety of colours and styles. Your children will make personalized gift cards. Is this a good strategy?</p>
<p>7. You kick off the holiday season by attending a performance of The Nutcracker with your parents, aunt and uncle. Everyone meets at your home for a potluck meal. As planned, your aunt and cousins bring an appetizer. Cousin Rachel brings a gelatin cream-cheese mould in the shape of a wreath with kiwis on the surface and, for a festive touch, crushed candy-cane sprinkles. It gets put in the back of the fridge. Should you have served the dish?</p>
<p>8. You are a first-year university student without any family in town, and have been invited to a fellow student's house for Christmas dinner. You are a vegetarian but don't want to burden the host. Should you let your eating habits be known?</p>
<p>9. Friends are hosting an open house. They and their daughters have received the H1N1 vaccine. To ensure a safe celebration, the hosts have decided to have a no-handshake party and greet guests with fist bumps and hugs without kisses. Is this greeting acceptable?</p>
<p>10. Your parents live miles away and visit during the holidays, when they spoil your children. You graciously thank your parents, but know there is no way your kids will wear all the cute outfits. Once they leave, you give some of the toys to charity and exchange the outfits for more practical wear. Should you have kept the gifts?</p>
<p>AND THE ETIQUETTE EXPERT SAYS ...</p>
<p>1. Re-gifting used to be a complete no-no, but is generally acceptable, given the economic situation. Recycling a gift is also OK if it's store-bought with originally packaging and tags and not made especially for you. Remember, as Oprah says, "doubt means don't." If you're afraid of hurting someone's feelings, or there's a slim chance that your worlds will collide, don't.</p>
<p>2. Call a sitter on this one. Without the children's names on the invitation, they're not invited. The same rule applies to the office party. Generally, all invitees are listed on the invitation. If you receive a work invitation with only your name on it, go solo, especially during office hours. When in doubt, simply ask the host.</p>
<p>3. Although a good choice for this person, gifts to the boss are discouraged. They may be perceived as seeking personal favours and, for that reason, it's best to offer a group gift or to express sentiments in a card. Alcoholic gifts are discouraged, especially in the workplace.</p>
<p>4. This is appropriate if you don't want to reciprocate gifts annually with your neighbour, especially since you wrote a thank-you note. The same would apply to holiday cards. Should you receive a greeting card and not wish to include the good-wisher on your annual list, thank her the next time you speak to her. If you wish to add her to your list, reciprocate by sending your holiday card. You can always have a couple of "just in case" gifts wrapped and ready to go. Hostess gifts with a holiday theme such as centrepieces, ornaments, hand towels, or a box of chocolates are ideal.</p>
<p>5. Due to your current budgetary restrictions, it's OK to forgo this tradition. The main point of this gesture is the recognition of good service throughout the year. Express your appreciation in a holiday card, with or without an explanation for the absence of tip or gift. Your card could be accompanied by baked goods or a homemade craft.</p>
<p>6. This strategy works. Not every gift has to be different. It especially works since your children will be involved in the process and will learn the tradition of gift-giving in recognition of the efforts and affection of those around them. Holiday music CDs, ornaments, plants, or gift cards to a bookstore, coffee shop or movie theatre are good options.</p>
<p>7. Although it may not appeal to you and your other guests, as a hostess, you graciously accept the contribution and serve it. If you receive a box of chocolates as a hostess gift, you would serve it at dessert. On the other hand, if you receive a bottle of wine, you have the choice of saving it for later or serving it, if it pairs well with your meal.</p>
<p>8. It's best to inform your host and volunteer to bring a vegetarian dish. If a guest has allergies, it's imperative to advise the host.</p>
<p>9. Yes, greeting alternatives are acceptable. No matter what your choice is, greet everyone in the same way without discriminating.</p>
<p>10. Because gift receipts are often enclosed, it's easy and acceptable to take something back to the store, exchange it or offer it to charity, if you won't use or don't like it, except when it's one-of-a-kind or made especially for you.</p>
