<p>A single dose of the human swine-flu vaccine set for Canada provides nearly 100-per-cent immunity from H1N1 three weeks after vaccination, according to early results from the first clinical trial of the pandemic vaccine.</p>
<p>Some experts have worried that two doses, given three weeks apart, would be needed to get adequate immunity. If the results hold out, Canada will have more vaccine than it needs.</p>
<p>Logistically, it would mean people would not have to line up for multiple shots, increasing the chances of getting a higher percentage of the population vaccinated and, in turn, getting population-wide immunity up faster.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> announced Monday that its pandemic vaccine induced a strong immune response after the first dose in a trial involving 130 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 60.</p>
<p>U.S. scientists warned last week that H1N1 vaccines will arrive too late to hold back a second wave of illness. The pandemic is most likely to follow the pattern of the Asian flu of 1957-58, they said -- substantial spread beginning any day now, and peaking in mid-to-late October.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50.4 million vaccine doses from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. That was based on the assumption that two doses would be needed, and that 60 per cent of the population would want it, or need it.</p>
<p>The 50 million doses on order "is enough for giving everybody who wants (the vaccine) two doses, a primary and a booster," said Earl Brown, head of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>"This [<span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>] data is saying we're going to have twice as much as we expect, as far as practical use."</p>
<p>A <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> spokesman said no adverse events have been reported in the trial.</p>

</p>
<p>Toronto, Edmonton --</p>
<p>Canada has recorded its second Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 case in an Alberta woman who was being treated for the flu virus.</p>
<p>The antiviral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza are effective in fighting swine flu, if taken within days of the first symptoms. But there have been people who have shown resistance to the drugs.</p>
<p>The case in Alberta was a lab-confirmed H1N1 infection. The resistance to the drug was identified from an additional sample that was taken in mid-August while the patient was being treated for another condition, Alberta Health Services said today.</p>
<p>"This is significant because oseltamivir or Tamiflu is the medication that is most commonly used to treat influenza around the world," Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health, said in a press release. "Any resistance to medication is important because it could possibly lead to further cases of resistant disease and potentially impact how a disease spreads."</p>
<p>Health authorities are now investigating if the drug-resistant organism was present at the start of the patient's illness or if it developed during treatment. Dr. Predy told reporters at a news conference that this is believed to be an isolated case.</p>
<p>"This is not an unexpected event," he told reporters.</p>
<p>The patient, who isn't being identified for confidentiality reasons, has recovered and never had to be hospitalized.</p>
<p>Dr. Predy said that despite this case, health officials are not changing how they deal with H1N1 cases. "It really doesn't change our approach to vaccination," he said.</p>
<p>There have been a handful of Tamiflu-resistant cases around the world. Over the summer, a 60-year-old Quebec man became Canada's first case. He was given Tamiflu after his son fell ill with the virus. He still got sick. The man recovered from the H1N1 flu without complications.</p>
<p>Canadian health authorities have stressed that Tamiflu has a strong safety profile. Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, has said it's not a cure for the flu, but a "strong and important" treatment option.</p>
<p>The federal government signed an interim order allowing doctors to prescribe the antiviral drug Tamiflu to prevent infection or treat cases of pandemic H1N1 in infants under one year old. Health authorities in the United States and Britain have made similar changes.</p>

</div><div>The Gazette</div>

<p>Why is H1N1 a threat?</p>
<p>H1N1 flu virus is a respiratory illness that causes symptoms similar to those of the regular human seasonal flu. The symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle aches and pains, lack of appetite, coughing, sore throat and possibly a headache. Some people with H1N1 flu virus have also reported vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Influenza and other respiratory infections are transmitted from person to person when germs enter the nose and/or throat. Coughs and sneezes release germs into the air where they can be breathed in by others. Germs can also rest on hard surfaces, like counters and doorknobs, where they can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches their mouth and/or nose.</p>
<p>The strain of H1N1 flu virus is a new influenza virus. Since this is a new strain, people will likely have no natural immunity to protect against the virus.</p>
<p>How can I improve my chances of avoiding contracting the virus?</p>
<p>All strains of influenza can be dangerous; however, good infection prevention measures can help protect you and others:</p>
<p>Wash your hands often and thoroughly in warm, soapy water or use hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>Cough and sneeze in your arm, not your hand.</p>
<p>Keep common surfaces and items clean and disinfected.</p>
<p>Stay home if you're sick, unless directed to seek medical care.</p>
<p>How to wash your hands:</p>
<p>Remove all rings and wet your hands with warm running water.</p>
<p>Put a small amount of liquid soap in the palm of one hand. Bar soaps are not as hygienic as liquid soaps because they stay moist and attract germs. If a bar soap is the only option, it should be stored on a rack so that the bar doesn't sit in water.</p>
<p>Rub your hands together for 20 seconds so you produce lather. Make sure you scrub between your fingers, under your fingernails and the backs of your hands.</p>
<p>Rinse your hands well with clean running water for at least 10 seconds. Try not to handle the faucets once your hands are clean. Use a paper towel to turn off the water.</p>
<p>Dry your hands with a single-use paper towel. If you use a hand towel, be sure to change it daily. During cold and flu season you might want each family member to have his or her own hand towel.</p>
<p>Use hand lotion to put moisture back into your skin if your hands are dry.</p>

<p>Wash your hands! It's one of the first lessons our parents taught us when we were little. And your grandparents taught them the same thing once upon a time: use plenty of soap, rinse with hot water, dry off with a clean towel - and take your time!</p>
<p>You thought you had it all figured out. But now all of a sudden, everybody's talking about the importance of washing your hands all over again. You read it in the newspapers, see it on TV and hear it on the radio. There are even posters going up on school walls.</p>
<p>So what's the big deal about having clean hands?</p>
<p>H1N1, that' what.</p>
<p>Also known as the swine flu, it's a potentially deadly new form of influenza that, since this past spring, has claimed the lives of dozens of Canadians. Now that flu season is on its way back, H1N1 is threatening to return with a vengeance. And it's spread by human contact.</p>
<p>Of course, the easiest way to cope with and survive H1N1 is not to come into contact with this flu virus in the first place. That's why we're being reminded to protect ourselves with good hygiene - starting with washing your hands.</p>
<p>Mohammad Ullah, one of four students interviewed at Westmount High School, has never hesitated to wash his hands regularly. Now, he's lathering up even more often.</p>
<p>"Because of H1N1, I'm just trying to be on the safe side," said the 15-year-old Grade 10 student. "I'm more cautious about what I do. You can't see the virus, so washing your hands is one thing we have to fight against it, and stay healthy."</p>
<p>So what's so special about this flu strain? According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, H1N1 is an influenza virus that usually affects pigs, but which may also make people sick. The H1N1 flu virus is a respiratory illness that causes symptoms similar to those of the regular human seasonal flu. So if you're feeling sick with flu symptoms, it makes sense that you should stay home and seek medical attention. If you aren't sick, you should try to stay clean.</p>
<p>Grade 11 student Olivia Gilbey, 17, has heard a lot about H1N1. Until recently, she thought the issue may have been blown out of proportion.</p>
<p>"I've never thought, 'Oh, man, I could get the flu next week. It's going to be bad; I should wash my hands every two seconds.'</p>
<p>"Of course it's true, you think that there are people dying (of H1N1), but it's never been the main thing on my mind."</p>
<p>But with the huge emphasis that her parents, the media and school officials have put on H1N1, is she starting to change her own behaviour?</p>
<p>"Of course," she said. "Because all the parents are freaking out and the schools are putting in precautions. And it kind of makes you think, 'Maybe I should be washing my hands more.' I should maybe be thinking of who I'm shaking hands with or who I'm around with."</p>
<p>And to make sure kids keep their hands clean, schools like Westmount High are getting the message out with new curriculum and signage. And they're installing hand sanitizers, too, in order to halt the spread of the virus and encourage safe hygiene among students.</p>
<p>"For us, it definitely is a priority," said Westmount High vice-principal Steven Erdelyi. "We've purchased 12 hand sanitizers, which is obviously a start. We're installing them now in key areas, like the main office, for example, and gym, and near the guidance counsellors - areas that tend to be more high-traffic.</p>
<p>"At the same time, we're still encouraging students to wash their hands on a regular basis. We feel that it's more important for them to wash their hands. We don't want them to become complacent and assume that the hand sanitizer is better than soap and water."</p>
<p>Hand sanitizers are products often sold in pump bottles that dispense a foam or gel that kills most germs and viruses on contact. They don't replace good hand-washing, but they're the next best thing when you're rushing from class to class.</p>
<p>Chris Eustace is a West Island activist who has been staging a one-man campaign encouraging schools to install hand sanitizer dispensers.</p>
<p>"I think that hand sanitizers are definitely the way to go," said Eustace, who formerly taught at Pierrefonds Comprehensive High School.</p>
<p>He wants to see school officials get together with government to pay for and install dispensers in every Quebec classroom.</p>
<p>"At $25-$40 per unit, it's not big money," he said. "It would be a very healthy investment. There's no question about it. Schools are a breeding ground (for virus- and germ-borne illness)."</p>
<p>And it's not just in schools that we're seeing hand sanitizers. Grade 10 student Farhana Shema Begum, 15, has noticed them springing up all over the place.</p>
<p>"Even in hospitals," she said. "Like as you enter, you always have to put the hand sanitizer in your hands."</p>
<p>For her part, Begum is very well informed about the path of destruction associated with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>"First, they said it came from Mexico," she explained. "Then, it went to America. Then, it spread a little bit to Canada. And then, it went to Asia. And then, lastly, it went to Australia, I heard."</p>
<p>"Canada declared it as a pandemic," she explained. "I think statistics show that with the regular flu, 4,000 people die (across Canada per year). But when the H1N1 flu came, only 70 people died in Canada alone."</p>
<p>Still, she's not taking any chances. So she says that she will get her H1N1 flu vaccination once they are made available to the public later this fall.</p>
<p>Grade 10 student Emmett Keyserlingk, 14, has also learned a lot about H1N1 in the past few months.</p>
<p>"It's unavoidable," he said. "You're kind of compelled to listen. You've got a lot of people telling you a lot of different things. But you know it boils down to in the end, sanitation and public health."</p>
<p>He's not yet convinced that H1N1 will turn out to be the public-health disaster some health officials fear. Nevertheless, the threat does bring an opportunity to learn the importance of keeping clean, and maybe saving yourself or someone you love from the effects of the virus.</p>
<p>"For a lot of people, it may be an excuse to be taught more about sanitation and keeping your hands clean and not coughing on your neighbour."</p>
<p>So it turns out that safety from H1N1 springs from common sense. But it's also good manners to wash your hands - just like our parents taught us.</p>

</p>
<p>Two major events could coincide this fall--a federal election and the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic --and that possibility is adding to the list of questions about Canada's pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>An election campaign could be triggered Friday if the Conservative government fails to secure the support of at least one of the opposition parties in a confidence vote.</p>
<p>"Elections Canada is taking appropriate steps in line with government of Canada guidelines to provide Canadians with a safe and healthy voting environment," Diane Benson, a spokeswoman for Elections Canada, said Monday in response to a letter from the New Democratic Party's health critic Judy Wasylycia-Leis.</p>
<p>Those steps include making hand sanitizer available at polling stations, and communicating health advice to voters, staff and volunteers, Benson said. Both of those measures were recommended in a set of guidelines released last week by the public health agency on mass gatherings of people.</p>
<p>The agency has not recommended the cancellation of large public events, but the guidelines advise organizers to work closely with local health authorities and to conduct a risk assessment when deciding whether to go ahead with an event. Factors to be considered in a risk assessment include the purpose of the event and the "potential political, social, cultural and economic impacts" of cancelling it.</p>
<p>If the political impact is to be considered, then the cancellation of any kind of rally or gathering during a campaign is unlikely, and as Wasylycia-Leis said, candidates depend on human contact during a campaign.</p>
<p>"It's key. So how do you go from being warm and inviting and encouraging contact to resisting shaking hands and hugging and inviting human contact?" she said.</p>
<p>"To have a pandemic and an election happening at the same time is just about the worst-case scenario you can imagine, so we're going to have to be careful in terms of how it's conducted and what precautions are taken," Wasylycia-Leis said in an interview.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said she wants to be assured by Elections Canada that it is talking to the Public Health Agency of Canada and getting ready for an election day that could come at the height of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Health experts are warning that a second wave of the pandemic could hit early this fall, ahead of the normal flu season, and it could hit harder than the first wave in the spring. The number of individual cases of swine flu is no longer being tracked except for hospitalizations. To date, more than 1,400 Canadians have been hospitalized and the virus has been linked to 74 deaths.</p>
<p>A new H1N1 vaccine is key in the strategy to minimize the spread of the disease, but it is not set to be rolled out until November. Canadians could have voted by then.</p>
<p>Politicians may be counting on shaking hands this fall, but business executives belonging to the Association of Corporate Travel Executives were advised Monday to keep their hands in their pockets. The group said it polled its members and found it would be easier for business travellers to drop the traditional handshake than to sneeze into their sleeves as a way to mitigate the spread of the virus, as recommended by public health officials.</p>
<p>"I find it highly unlikely that executives will risk soiling their business suits while on the way to an important business meeting, on the odd shot that they could be halting the spread of the H1N1 influenza germ," the group's executive director Susan Gurley said in a statement.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario rules out closing schools to stop H1N1</b>
</div><div>By Jeff Outhit   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>689 words</div><div>15 September 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>Ontario plans to keep schools open until well into an outbreak of H1N1 flu, should one occur.</p>
<p>This is despite new World Health Organization research that suggests closing schools very early in a H1N1 flu outbreak may achieve great public health benefits.</p>
<p>The agency says the best time to close schools is before one per cent of the population falls ill. If done in ideal conditions, this can help slow the spread of disease, reduce the demand on health care by up to 50 per cent, and buy time to build up vaccines and complete other preparations.</p>
<p>"Modelling studies suggest that school closure has its greatest benefits when schools are closed very early in an outbreak," the World Health Organization states in a Sept. 11 release.</p>
<p>"However, if schools close too late in the course of a community-wide outbreak, the resulting reduction in transmission is likely to be very limited."</p>
<p>Ontario is aware of the research but has chosen not to pursue early school closures, Dr. Arlene King said Monday while visiting the region.</p>
<p>King, Ontario's chief medical officer of health, said the province's plan is to consider closing a school only if too many staff are sick to run the school safely.</p>
<p>Local authorities would consider such closures on a school-by-school basis. There are no plans to tell parents about absentee rates among staff or students in specific classrooms or schools.</p>
<p>This is partly due to concerns that parents may react by keeping children at home, in what health officials say is a pointless effort to protect them.</p>
<p>King says the risks of closing schools early in a flu outbreak are greater than the risk of keeping them open. The concerns she raised are also acknowledged by the World Health Organization:</p>
<p>It's difficult to keep children from gathering outside closed schools and continuing to spread the flu.</p>
<p>Some parents who work in health care might have to stay home with their children, putting more pressure on the health-care system.</p>
<p>Schools are a good place for children to learn how to protect themselves, by washing their hands often, coughing into their sleeve, and staying home when sick.</p>
<p>Closing schools strips children of other social and public health benefits, such as meal programs.</p>
<p>King stressed that the H1N1 virus has not had a significant impact on the province or its health system. "So far, this has been a very mild disease," she said.</p>
<p>Locally, nobody has died of swine flu. Only nine victims spent time in hospital. There have only been 38 confirmed cases locally and nobody is currently in hospital with the disease.</p>
<p>Provincewide, the mortality rate for swine flu has been 18 times lower than the mortality rate for regular seasonal flu. However, the global pandemic that emerged last spring out of Mexico is expected to dominate the flu season that's about to start. Most Ontario cases of H1N1 have been youths aged five to 19, with the highest number between 10 and 14. This is raising concerns about how it will spread through schools.</p>
<p>A special vaccine against H1N1 is expected by November. It will be made available first to residents who are considered most at risk, possibly including pregnant women and people with pre-existing medical conditions. Vaccinations for the general public would follow.</p>
<p>Vaccines will also be available this fall for regular seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Authorities no longer plan to test for the H1N1 virus among the public, saying there's no point now that the virus has spread into the community. Only people sick enough to end up in hospital, and some others, will get laboratory confirmations.</p>
<p>The local public health department plans to tell the public, through updates on its website, how the disease is affecting the community. This may include publication of schoolwide absentee rates, impacts on emergency rooms, and hospitalization rates.</p>
<p>Ontario is launching television ads to tell people how to protect themselves and every household will soon receive a brochure about the flu.</p>

<p>Owner of sunken fishing vessel questions location of rescue base</p>
<p>The owner of a fishing vessel from Newfoundland that sank on the weekend with the loss of at least one crew member says the tragedy might have been avoided if the federal government had based a helicopter in St. John's. Laurie Sullivan of Calvert was critical of Ottawa on Monday, saying fishers have long lobbied for a search and rescue helicopter in St. John's to assist in emergencies in the North Atlantic. The search and rescue helicopter station for the province is based in Gander, in central Newfoundland. One fisher, Robert Keough, 58, of Calvert, was confirmed dead on Monday, and the coast guard said it was still looking for another missing crew member, three days after the sinking of the Sea Gypsy Enterprises on Saturday.</p>

<p>Clement denies charge of special scrutiny for gay-themed events</p>
<p>Industry Minister Tony Clement denied Monday he directed his department to give any special scrutiny to gay-themed tourism events, and lashed out angrily at opposition suggestions that homophobia motivated government funding decisions. Clement insisted he did not oust cabinet colleague Diane Ablonczy from the helm of a tourism program after she approved funding for Toronto's Gay Pride Week. The Canadian Press reported this week that Clement had a direct hand in formally revoking Ablonczy's authority over the Marquee Tourism Events Program, as outlined in a letter his chief of staff sent to bureaucrats last June.</p>

<p>Elections Canada taking precautions</p>
<p>in light of possible vote, H1N1 flu</p>
<p>Canada's election agency is stockpiling hand sanitizer as it prepares for a possible election and a potential H1N1 flu outbreak. A spokesperson for Elections Canada said Monday each polling station will have two bottles of hand sanitizer along with posters urging flu-stricken voters to cough into their sleeves and wash their hands. "The health and safety of Canadian voters during a general election is a priority for Elections Canada," Diane Benson said. "Elections Canada is taking appropriate steps in line with government of Canada guidelines to provide Canadians with a safe and healthy voting environment." Benson wasn't immediately able to say how much it will cost to stock each voting station with bottles of hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>CALGARY</p>
<p>RCMP says it had stopped alleged</p>
<p>Ponzi scheme valued at $100M</p>
<p>One Alberta man is under arrest and another is believed to be at large in Honduras after the Mounties say they broke up a "significant" Ponzi scheme that they allege bilked thousands of investors worldwide out of $100 million. The RCMP arrested and laid fraud charges against Milowe Allen Brost, 55, on Sunday after a three-and-a-half year investigation. Charges have also been laid against another suspect - Gary Allen Sorenson, 66 - who is believed to be out of the country. Both men are charged with fraud over $5,000 and theft over $5,000. Supt. Eric Mattson, with the RCMP's Integrated Market Enforcement Team in Calgary, said the two allegedly bilked 3,000 people out of $100 million.</p>
<p>EDMONTON</p>
<p>Bob Barker heads north to argue</p>
<p>for elephant to be relocated</p>
<p>This is showdown week in the battle between zoo officials, animal rights groups and a retired game-show host over whether Lucy the elephant should be moved to the U.S. where she could be with other elephants. Bob Barker, a well-known animal activist and the former host of The Price is Right, will travel to Edmonton on Thursday to convince people that Lucy needs to be relocated because having a lone elephant at any zoo amounts to torture for the highly social animals. But Edmonton's Valley Zoo delivered a pre-emptive public relations strike Monday by releasing an independent evaluation, which concludes that moving the 34-year-old elephant could end up killing her.</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Province's ombudsman happy</p>
<p>with new rules for OLG retailers</p>
<p>Barring retailers from buying lottery tickets in their own stores is a good step toward preventing more fraud at the beleaguered <span class="companylink">Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp</span>., Ontario's ombudsman said Monday, but critics questioned how the new rules will be monitored. "We nudged the OLG forward on this issue and I'm pleased to see that the government has stepped in and made the right decision," said ombud Andre Marin. Marin had been ready to push for a complete ban for retailers if the agency didn't show signs of improvements after a scathing report in 2007. He now says the latest changes raise hopes that the agency isn't dealing with an "ungovernable lot," and adds prohibiting insiders from buying their own tickets is actually an inexpensive and practical solution.</p>

</p>
<p>If men lie twice as often as women - the conclusion of a new British poll - there's probably a good reason for this truth gap.</p>
<p>For example, I have never asked my wife if my buttocks look big in a pair of rayon trousers. Other questions I've refrained from posing: "Do you think my new colleague is hot?" "Did you remember to feed the cats?" and "Should we discuss school districts this weekend?"</p>
<p>As a result of my thoughtful non-asking, my wife has coasted through domestic life, riding her high horse on the high road while maintaining a deceptively noble mantra of, "Honesty is the best policy."</p>
<p>In short: She lies less than I do, a fact that is now backed up by science.</p>
<p>According to the British poll, the average man lies six times a day. This translates into 42 lies a week, 2,184 lies a year and 126,672 lies over an average lifetime - more if the man is also a Canadian politician.</p>
<p>When I conveyed these stats to Megan Fox this weekend during our intimate dinner date, she was flabbergasted. She was still joking about it four hours later, as we raced out of Yorkville in my Maserati to escape the hounding paparazzi.</p>
<p>By contrast, the average woman lies three times a day. Presumably, these include: "You're the best I've ever had," "An anniversary date at the Golden Griddle sounds awesome," and "Yes, I believe you."</p>
<p>Ladies, to atone for this male mendacity, today I become a turncoat.</p>
<p>Risking censure and expulsion from my fibbing brotherhood, I shall reveal closely guarded secrets with the hope that we may one day cohabit without deception.</p>
<p>20 Signs Your Man Is Lying:</p>
<p>1. He touches your hair for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>2. When told your parents are coming over, he coughs and says swine flu has been going around his office.</p>
<p>3. He yawns dramatically after claiming the new Blu-ray player was 90 per cent off.</p>
<p>4. He overuses the word "absolutely" when you argue over finances.</p>
<p>5. Sometimes, in his sleep, he blurts out, "It wasn't me."</p>
<p>6. He calls you at work to say his best friend is going through a relationship crisis and is threatening suicide unless he goes to the pub with him tonight.</p>
<p>7. He says the video store was out of Meg Ryan titles.</p>
<p>8. When you ask about the stag, he blinks rapidly and says, "What did you hear?"</p>
<p>9. He says you are the best driver in the universe.</p>
<p>10. When you mention redecorating the living room, he says an ex-girlfriend once broke up with him at Ikea.</p>
<p>11. He says nothing makes him happier than a long stroll along the boardwalk when the game is in overtime.</p>
<p>12. While denying he visits certain websites, he accidentally calls you "Jenna."</p>
<p>13. He says his cellphone must be broken because it never rang when he was golfing.</p>
<p>14. He says that new purse was absolutely worth $400. Absolutely.</p>
<p>15. When you innocently ask about his ex-wife, he furrows his brow and says, "I can't remember."</p>
<p>16. He buys you flowers even though there's no occasion.</p>
<p>17. When you ask about a weird online gambling charge on the Visa bill, he bets you $100 he can get to the bottom of this crazy mix-up.</p>
<p>18. He then expresses a sudden desire to move to a new city.</p>
<p>19. He says he ordered the meat lovers' pizza before knowing you were making vegetarian lasagna.</p>
<p>20. He asks about your day three times before you take off your shoes.</p>

</p>
<p>CAN Premier Gary Doer wear two hats at the same time without confusing anyone over which hat he's wearing?</p>
<p>That was the big issue Monday on the first day of the fall session at the Manitoba legislature when the two opposition parties charged Doer was in a conflict of interest as he could not be premier and Canada's designated ambassador to the United States at the same time.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Jon Gerrard said Doer should get an opinion from the province's conflict of interest commissioner Bill Norrie on whether he can represent the province and at the same time answer to the prime minister as Stephen Harper's choice for Canada's man in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>"He has a very clear conflict of interest standing up for both Manitoba, very forcefully while it deals with provincial issues, and also being responsible to the prime minister," Gerrard said.</p>
<p>Gerrard interrupted Monday's question period on a point of order, asking Speaker George Hickes to send the matter to a legislative committee to be reviewed.</p>
<p>"I believe that this is a serious matter," he said. "We should make sure that the premier has adequately consulted the commissioner for ethics."</p>
<p>Doer said Gerrard was simply grandstanding as it's no secret he's leaving the job after 10 years as premier.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is I'm the designate," Doer said. "I'm working for the people of Manitoba. It would have been irresponsible not to complete the house and the legislation that's before the house. I could have prorogued the house. I thought that would have been irresponsible.</p>
<p>"It's all public," he added. "I said what I was going to do and when I was going to do it. There's nothing new here. Quite frankly, you can complete your job as premier and I will do so with pride and a designate is not the ambassador. It's the designate."</p>
<p>Tory leader Hugh McFadyen said the more important issue is who is actually running the government with Doer stepping down and three top cabinet ministers out of the picture. Steve Ashton, Andrew Swan and Greg Selinger have had to give up their cabinet posts to compete for Doer's job.</p>
<p>"The key thing for us is that there's stability in government as we tackle some big challenges like H1N1 and some financial challenges," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 fears should halt election: MP -</b>
</div><div>By Mia Rabson   </div>

<p>OTTAWA -- Manitoba MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis joked Monday she might hang a sign around her neck telling voters she'd like to shake their hand or give them a hug but she can't because of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>But she wasn't joking when she wrote to Elections Canada wondering exactly what plans and precautions the agency is taking to protect voters, candidates and campaign workers during an election.</p>
<p>"What happens if 30 per cent of your volunteers are off sick? How do we ensure people who are sick don't get disenfranchised," she said.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said the Public Health Agency of Canada advised last week that some mass gatherings should be cancelled or postponed in the event of a flu outbreak. If that happened it would have serious implications for how elections are run, she said.</p>
<p>Most ridings have public meetings and forums to meet candidates, events that may need to be reconsidered if H1N1 takes hold, Wasylycia-Leis said.</p>
<p>She said candidates will also have to rethink how they go about knocking on doors. She said she often shakes hands and hugs voters and will feel compelled to explain why she won't be doing that if an election occurs this fall.</p>
<p>"We're going to have to change our habits in the campaign," she said. "Maybe having a sign saying the reason we're not shaking their hand."</p>
<p>Candidates who themselves become ill will pose a new problem as well.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for Elections Canada said Monday the agency will take its direction from Health Canada in responding to an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>She said hand sanitizers will be made available at all polling stations along with posters advising people what precautions to take and how to recognize symptoms.</p>
<p>She said advice given to returning office workers and volunteers will be the same that Health Canada gives all Canadians.</p>
<p>Wasylycia-Leis said the health concerns are another reason parliamentarians should avoid an election this fall.</p>
<p>"If there is any way we can avoid having an election during a pandemic we should," she said.</p>
<p>It is her own party that holds the key to that decision. The Liberals have already pledged to vote against the Conservatives but the NDP is making noise about supporting the Conservatives in a confidence vote this week.</p>
<p>That vote will include new measures on employment insurance, which the NDP says are a good start.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>France expects every Muslim to do his duty; The military of a country famous for secular crackdowns is giving Muslim soldiers their own hajj trips to Mecca</b>
</div><div>SUSAN SACHS   </div>
<div>SPECIAL TO THE GLOBE AND MAIL</div>

</p>
<p>PARIS -- Muslims in France's army who go on the pilgrimage to Mecca this year will not have to travel on private commercial flights or bunk with ordinary civilians. In a break from tradition, the Defence Ministry will provide a plane to fly them to Saudi Arabia and organize their stay.</p>
<p>For any Western government to arrange a hajj trip would be unusual. It is especially so here, in a country so protective of its secularism that it regulates what Muslim girls can wear in school and is considering a blanket ban on the face-covering Islamic niqab.</p>
<p>But for Mohamed-Ali Bouharb, a spit-and-polish gendarmerie captain who put together the final pieces for the pilgrimage last week, it is one step toward making Islam as “banal” in France as any other religion.</p>
<p>“The army is always in advance of society,” said Capt. Bouharb, one of the 30 Muslim chaplains recently recruited by the armed forces. “And it is anesthetized from all the social questions and debate outside.”</p>
<p>While religion and state remain firmly separated in the rest of French society, the military has started accommodating its Muslim personnel in ways that would be unthinkable outside the barracks.</p>
<p>It now provides halal meals and, where possible, prayer rooms. Last week, the Muslim chaplaincy published the first edition of a new magazine, splashed with photos of mosques, recipes for meals to break the Ramadan fast and an article that would not raise an eyebrow in any French magazine. Its subject: How do you say “I love you?”</p>
<p>France has the largest Muslim population in Europe, estimated at between five and seven million people, or about 7 to 10 per cent of the French population.</p>
<p>Statistics are not available because, officially, the state does not collect data according to ethnicity, religion or race. But the ratio of Muslims in the military, including the national police or gendarmerie, mirrors that in the population as a whole, according to Capt. Bouharb and other officials.</p>
<p>Minorities are still clustered almost exclusively in the lower ranks. But Muslims have served in the army since France's days as a colonial power 150 years ago and, until mandatory conscription was ended in 1996, they were drafted as soldiers like other young French men.</p>
<p>Yet Islam in the military was not on an equal footing with other faiths. The Defence Ministry created a Muslim chaplaincy only in 2005, long after it had established Catholic, Protestant and Jewish offices.</p>
<p>Much of the credit for the changes is given to the corps of Muslim chaplains, who also serve as prayer leaders or imams. While they have been integrated into all branches of the military, they have also been enrolled in a special course in French-style secularism.</p>
<p>Last year the army sent two of its Muslim chaplains to a government-sponsored class on citizenship and secular values for imams, the first of its kind, and another six will attend the course this fall.</p>
<p>The course was taught at the private Catholic Institute of Paris because no public university was willing to wade into the state-religion divide. Some French Muslim leaders also criticized it as an inappropriate attempt by the state to take on the training of imams.</p>
<p>“What I knew about secularism going in was what everybody knows,” said Capt. Bouharb, 32, who was one of the first graduates. “What I learned was its history, all the political debate at the beginning of the 20th century and its legal basis.”</p>
<p>He also said the course left him better prepared to explain France to its own Muslim citizens, like those who come to him complaining that their daughters cannot wear head scarves in school or that their town refuses to set aside women's hours in the public pool.</p>
<p>“Even if our parents were not born in France, it's our country,” said Capt. Bouharb, whose parents immigrated to France from Tunisia in the 1970s.</p>
<p>There were misgivings even among Muslims in the military when the chaplaincy was first set up.</p>
<p>Only one in five imams in France speaks French as their first language. On average they are older than 50 and had their religious training in the Middle East or Turkey.</p>
<p>So some soldiers and gendarmes worried they might get an old-fashioned imam in a North African djelabah robe and floppy slippers, said Capt. Bouharb, or else “some bearded guy like Khomaini or somebody who only speaks Arabic.”</p>
<p>The French army, with its long history of bonds with the Catholic Church, has for years sponsored annual trips for its soldiers to Catholic shrines in Lourdes. But the chaplains said the impetus for the army's upcoming hajj trip was more about security than playing catch-up.</p>
<p>Military personnel who travel on their own for the hajj could fall victim “to thieves or swindlers or disreputable travel agencies,” Capt. Bouharb said. “Or imagine the situation of a serviceman who goes on his own and stays in a place where there's some incident – I don't know what kind, but maybe a bomb or a fire.”</p>
<p>Soldiers and police officers who go under the auspices of the military will have to pay about €3,000 – roughly $4,700 – less than most private travel agencies would generally charge, and their housing and guides will be provided by their counterparts in the Saudi Defence Ministry.</p>
<p>The trip is scheduled for November, unless it is cancelled over concerns about swine flu.</p>

</p>
<p>I'm going to be blunt -- this has been the summer from Hell! Seriously.</p>
<p>Lousy weather. Even lousier football team. Mosquitoes the size of Jack Russell Terriers. The threat of an unwanted federal election just as the economy is poking its nose out of the sand after the worst recession in decades. And the possibility we'll all catch swine flu.</p>
<p>The sad truth is: Hell has had a nicer summer than Winnipeg. In fact, they've had a Hell of a summer in Hell. I know this for a fact because I called Hell yesterday and asked.</p>
<p>As regular readers will know, I am referring here to the tiny community of Hell, Mich., home to 72 people, a general store, an ice-cream parlour, a bar, a mini-golf course, a wedding chapel and a very nice mayor named John Colone.</p>
<p>Every once in a while, I get the urge to call John and point out that Winnipeg is a hell of a lot nicer than Hell. But yesterday I took a different journalistic approach.</p>
<p>Me: "Hello, John. I'd like to complain."</p>
<p>John: "That's not a problem."</p>
<p>Me: "Good, because we've had a (bad word) summer, our football team sucks, we've got mosquitoes capable of carrying off small dogs, we'll probably have an election and we're all wringing our hands over swine flu. So, how are things in Hell?"</p>
<p>John: "Things are going great in Hell!"</p>
<p>Me: "What's the weather been like?"</p>
<p>John: "It's been nice the last six to eight weeks. Today we had a high of 80.5F (27C)."</p>
<p>Me: "We were around 25C."</p>
<p>John: "You were colder than Hell!"</p>
<p>Me: "That figures. Got any mosquitoes?"</p>
<p>John: "We do have mosquitoes in Hell, but they haven't been as bad as last year."</p>
<p>Me: "Swell. Our football team, the Blue Bombers, got hammered by Saskatchewan in the Banjo Bowl. I was wondering if you'd like to have a football team in Hell."</p>
<p>John: "We've got one."</p>
<p>Me: "You do???"</p>
<p>John: "Yes, the Hell Red Devils. It's a bunch of local guys. They play touch football down in the river."</p>
<p>Me: "They play in the river???" John: "Uh huh. Hell Creek. They play in about five feet of water. We play different bars from out of town. Each team has five players."</p>
<p>Me: "Can I ask how they're doing?" John: "Our first game is a week from Saturday. Last year, we were undefeated. We won all three games."</p>
<p>Me: "Wow! Maybe they should play the Bombers?"</p>
<p>John: "I hope the Bombers have an air attack, because the guys down here are pretty rough."</p>
<p>Me: "Never mind. It sounds like you're having a Hell of a summer?"</p>
<p>John: "We've had a great year, with a lot of visitors from all over. Mini golf is open, there's been lots of weddings, we've been on The Travel Network and on Oct. 4 The Sundance Channel -- Robert Redford's cable TV channel -- will be spending about eight days with us doing a documentary on life in Hell."</p>
<p>Me: "I'm as jealous as... well, you know."</p>
<p>John: "Life is better in Hell. People have really been enjoying the summer. We have the Last Ride Reunion coming up."</p>
<p>Me: "???" John: "It's a hearse show. We have hearses coming from all over -- Chicago, Grand Rapids..."</p>
<p>Me: "I'm dying to hear more. But you must have had some bad news in Hell?"</p>
<p>John: "No, there haven't been any killings or murders or people getting beaten up."</p>
<p>Me: "Sorry to hear that."</p>
<p>John: "Well, we were supposed to have a wedding the other day. A couple came from Missouri to get married in Hell. They got out of the car screaming and fighting and swearing at each other, so they got back in the car and left."</p>
<p>Me: "Hell no?" John: "Yes! The minister was left standing there going: 'What the heck?' "</p>
<p>Me: "It sounds like Winnipeggers would be a lot happier if we all just went to Hell?"</p>
<p>John: "Absolutely. Spend some time in Hell while you can still enjoy it."</p>
<p>Me: "Maybe we'll just send you our football coach."</p>
<p>John: "Sure. We could make him Mayor of Hell for a day. Is there anything I can send him. I'll bet he'd like a T-shirt from Hell. He may be a good guy, but he could end up in Hell."</p>
<p>Me: "You never know, John. His name is Mike Kelly."</p>
<p>John: "Hey, I've got a friend named Mike Kelly!"</p>
<p>Me: "You have Mike Kelly in Hell?"</p>
<p>John: "Yes."</p>
<p>Me: "You've just made a lot of Bomber fans very happy, John."</p>

<p>111Both parties are essential to defeating the government -- the Liberals can't do it on their own. Either could save the government but their support would be difficult to obtain, even though nothing is impossible in politics. Mr. Layton has already hinted that his party's support can be bought with sympathetic legislation -- such as changes to employment insurance, and even suggested Monday that the possibility of an H1N1 flu epidemic in the autumn should delay a vote -- and Mr. Duceppe is consistent in his position that he will not bring down a government that is legislatively sympathetic to Quebec.</p>
<p>It may even be possible that Mr. Ignatieff might actually hope that one or the other of the opposition leaders will ride to the rescue and save him from having to force an election that the nation does not want, that he has no convincing reason to compel, and in which he is already trailing in the polls. Stranger things have happened in politics, although it is tough to think of many odder scenarios than Canadians face today.</p>
<p>But then, Mr, Ignatieff is no ordinary politician. He is, rather, an intellectual striving to become a politician. When his previous support for the war in Iraq turned out to be hugely unpopular among Canadian Liberals, he did a little wiggle. Actually, it was a pretty big wiggle. In an article in the <span class="companylink">New York Times Magazine</span>, he explained that politicians, as opposed to intellectuals, must "pretend to have emotions that you do not actually feel." In a world of "lunatic literalism... all that matters is what you said, not what you meant."</p>
<p>Writing in the Globe and Mail about an interview Mr. Ignatieff did with political scientist Denis Smith, Mr, Smith describes this transformation of the Liberal leader from intellectual to actor.</p>
<p>It may be an inevitable event in politics, but for Canadians who had high hopes for Mr. Ignatieff and the Liberal party when he returned to Canada, it has not been a pretty thing to watch.</p>
<p>Neither is it a pretty thing to see an election called for no good reason, to see a government brought down for no reason other than political profit.</p>

<p>It looks like election time again and the grumbling can be heard from all corners of this wonderful country.</p>
<p>My favourite is the expense of an election. If there is a better reason to pay taxes, please tell me what it is. Better yet, stay home like millions of Canadians did last time and watch a football game or a reality show. It takes prep time for more important TV viewing, anyway.</p>
<p>I love it when folks claim they're all the same, so why bother? They're all crooks -- normally follows, but so what, why not keep paying protection money? I mean, I don't know a single person who has more money in the bank because the GST is two cents less. Go figure.</p>
<p>Personally, I believe we have a legitimate reason not to vote. We'll all get the flu. You know, H1N1-swine flu. Now, that's Canadian. None of that NAFTA stuff from Mexico for this Canuck. Then again, we could travel to some exotic country.</p>
<p>Some custom official could challenge your passport and what do you know? You could find out you have paid taxes to the wrong country. Is there a better excuse not to vote?</p>
<p>Of course, being a citizen does have its responsibilities. It can be a job; you know what I'm saying? By the way, am I the only one who becomes confused during the French part of O Canada? Merry Xmas.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>I'm betting against a federal election</b>
</div><div>Licia Corbella   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>869 words</div><div>15 September 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Liberal leader Michael Ignatieff doesn't want an election any more than the rest of us. Fighting another federal election -- within one year of the last one -- doesn't make sense for him or his still debt-ridden party. He knows that.</p>
<p>His poll numbers aren't great, he hasn't articulated any platform or policies that will grab hold of the imaginations of a weary electorate, and the Grits' electoral campaign cupboard is bare.</p>
<p>As for Ignatieff himself, his popularity numbers actually poll below those of his party. As one politico confided to me, "To know him is not to love him."</p>
<p>Since Ignatieff orchestrated his Liberal leadership coronation following Stephane Dion's coalition-in-waiting with the Bloc Quebecois, he has not experienced much of a post-leadership bump in the polls. No honeymoon for Iggy. When it came to his love affair with the Canadian electorate, he started sleeping on the couch by the second or third week.</p>
<p>So, what gives? Why did he state: "Mr. Harper, your time is up. The Liberal party cannot support this government any further. We will hold it to account. We will oppose it in Parliament."</p>
<p>Sounds like he means it. Unlike previous blusterings that he would bring the Tories down, this time he didn't couch it with the word "unless." There is no way Ignatieff can back out of this threat this time. He will have to follow through and vote against Stephen Harper's government on a confidence motion at the first opportunity or lose credibility for a very long time.</p>
<p>Does he really want to go to the polls on the issues he articulated in his speech? "Stephen Harper ... failed to stand up for Canadians," he said and then mentioned Omar Khadr. Considering that Liberal PMs Jean Chretien and Paul Martin both failed to stand up for Khadr will make that a tough sell, not to mention that the Khadr family is political poison. My sense is that most Canadians don't want to welcome back Khadr (though it remains the right thing to do).</p>
<p>Ignatieff also railed against Canada letting the world down on medical isotopes, saying Harper "cancelled the MAPLE reactors that would have guaranteed Canadian leadership in isotope supply." Nice try, but the MAPLE reactors weren't cancelled so much as they just don't work and never have. They were commissioned by Chretien, went tens of millions of dollars over budget, were years behind schedule and experts believe they are unsalvageable. How is that Harper's fault?</p>
<p>Then there's employment insurance. Ignatieff wants Canadians to be eligible to take a year off -- drawing EI benefits after working just nine weeks. Not surprisingly, the Tories would love to go to an election on that idiotic piece of public policy. The very people this idea was supposed to entice --autoworkers losing their jobs -- are outraged. Why should some pimply kid whose summer job comes to an end get to draw EI benefits at the same rate as that autoworker who has paid into the system for decades? It'll be popular among the ski-bum crowd, but few others.</p>
<p>Basically, Ignatieff's recent speech at the Liberal caucus retreat in Sudbury was delivered more for the benefit of the Bloc and the NDP than for the governing Tories.</p>
<p>Ignatieff is gambling that the Bloc and the New Democrats don't want to go to the polls, either. Now he's telling them it's their turn to prop up the Tory minority government.</p>
<p>Neither party is awash in cash to fight another election and the NDP isn't exactly flying high in the polls. While the Bloc's popularity is up since last fall's election, nearly 40 per cent of the separatist party's 49 caucus members were elected in 2004 -- which means they won't be eligible to collect their lucrative MP pensions, should they lose their seats.</p>
<p>MPs must serve at least six years before being able to collect the gold-plated pensions that start paying out at age 55 until death. The same holds true for some 60 other MPs in other political parties.</p>
<p>Bloc Leader Gilles Duceppe says he will always do what's best for Quebecers and vote in the House of Commons issue by issue.</p>
<p>Wanna bet he'll just shrug his shoulders and declare that Quebecers don't want another election?</p>
<p>And when he really can't bring himself to vote for something, it's pretty likely the NDP will then find something to like. Both leaders will have each others' private phone lines on speed dial.</p>
<p>Or, here's an even easier out. The Tories, with their 142 seats out of 308, only need 13 votes from another party to not lose a confidence vote. Either that, or 13 opposition members will suddenly call in sick.</p>
<p>If I were a betting gal, I'd lay down a fair chunk of bacon that sniffles and purported cases of the swine flu will save us all from going to the polls this fall.</p>

<p>Unreal estate</p>
<p>Manchester United was quick to deny it, but French club Le Havre accused the English Premier League club of poaching promising propect Paul Pogba with bribes. A team spokesman said United had given Pogba's parents about $160,000 Canadian each and a house. Jean-Pierre Louvel, Le Havre president, also said Pogba, 16, was given guarantees about the wage he'd receive when he turns 17. "It is complete nonsense," a United spokesman said. "Everything has been done within FIFA guidelines." Meanwhile, Chelsea, accused by French team Lens of illegally inducing teenager Gael Kakuta and punished with a one-year transfer ban by world governing body FIFA, has launched an appeal.</p>
<p>Want a sale</p>
<p>About 500 unhappy Roma fans invaded the team's training grounds last week, carrying banners urging owner Rosella Sensi to sell the team. Two takeover attempts have failed in the past year, and Sensi has been unwilling to spend large amounts on players. Pharmaceutical magnate Francesco Angelini has expressed interest in buying the team. Unhappy coach Luciano Spalletti, frustrated by the lack of funds to obtain players, walked out two weeks ago and was replaced by Rome-born Claudio Ranieri in an obvious bid to placate angry supporters.</p>
<p>Who's in charge?</p>
<p>France coach Raymond Domenech is no stranger to criticism, with his wacky style often pilloried in the media, but this is something new. Now it's his own players turning on him. Star striker Thierry Henry blasted Domenech during training camp last week, according to the newspaper Le Parisien. "Coach, we have something to tell you, I am speaking in the name of the squad," the newspaper quoted Henry as telling Domenech. "We are getting bored during your training sessions. In 12 years with the French team, I have never been in such a situation. We do not know how to play, where to be on the field, how to organize. We do not know what to do. We have no style, no guidelines. It is not working." France tied World Cup qualifying Group 7 leader Serbia 1-1 last Wednesday and is in second place in the group, which would mean a playoff.</p>
<p>Eying Becks</p>
<p>AC Milan, which could use all the help it can get, is confident it can re-sign David Beckham in January. The English midfielder, who spent the last part of last season in Milan, on loan from Los Angeles of Major League Soccer, says he has offers from three or four other teams, but would like to return to Milan.</p>
<p>More poaching</p>
<p>England's National Football Museum will move from Preston to Manchester, officials have confirmed. Museum trustees said lack of funds in Preston, a city of less than 150,000 in northwest England, "had always been a concern." The museum, at the Deepdale Stadium, home of Preston North End of the English second tier, attracts more than 100,000 visitors a year. Admission is free. The museum has what is believed to be the finest collection of soccer memorabilia in the world, including the ball used in the 1966 World Cup final and the shirt worn by Diego Maradona when he scored the notorious "Hand of God" goal against England at the 1986 World Cup.</p>
<p>No contact</p>
<p>Dr. Pierre Rochecongar, a consultant on H1N1 influenza hired by the French soccer federation, has a simple method of cutting down the chance of infection. "If we can avoid all this exuberance after goals, that would be good," he said. France's national team is doing its best to comply by not scoring. In eight World Cup qualifiers, France has a paltry 10 goals.</p>
<p>Lost in translation</p>
<p>Leo Beenhakker, fired as Poland national-team coach after a 3-0 qualifying loss to Slovenia last week, was steamed about how he learned of the axing. "I was standing on the field waiting for an interview (after the game), and the reporter translated for me the conversation taking place three metres away with the president (of the Polish soccer federation, Grzegorz Lato). I heard: 'Hey, looks like you've been sacked.' Afterward, Lato came over to me and invited me to come on Tuesday for a chat. Is that his class? Did he have too much to drink? - I am the first person to take responsibility for how the national team played. I should be fired, but not in such a way. This isn't level zero, this is level minus-five."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Q-school qualifies Gligic for Tour</b>
</div><div>Garry McKay  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>472 words</div><div>14 September 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>SP06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>BURLINGTON</p>
<p>Michael Gligic will be heading back to the Canadian Professional Golf Tour next year with a renewed sense of purpose.</p>
<p>The Burlington golfer turned a solid performance at the Canadian Tour's Q-school, which wrapped up Saturday at Hidden Lake Golf and Country Club.</p>
<p>Gligic, who played the Tour last year but didn't make enough money to keep his playing card, fired rounds of 70-69-67-72 and his 278 total was good enough for a tie for third. The top 15 players after the 72-hole event earned their playing privileges while the next 15 earned non-exempt status.</p>
<p>Gligic, 19, was the youngest player on the Canadian Tour last year and admits the whole thing was a learning experience.</p>
<p>"It's just so different," he explains. "All the golf I'd played was drive half an hour to the course, play your tournament and drive home where this is, away from home for sometimes two months and flights and hotels and eating out all the time.</p>
<p>"I can't use that as an excuse. I just didn't play well enough this year and that's all there is to it."</p>
<p>The highlight of the year for Gligic came late in the summer when he was successful in Monday qualifying for a Nationwide Tour event.</p>
<p>"That was probably the best golfing experience of my life," he says. "I didn't play well in the tournament, but it was just good to see what it's like to play up there, everything from the rough, to the greens, to the amount of spectators.</p>
<p>"Now that I've been there, it's made me that much more determined to get there sometime in the near future."</p>
<p>This was a somewhat unusual week for Gligic, who had the luxury of playing the tournament on his home course.</p>
<p>In each of the first three rounds, he bogeyed two early holes and then had to dig himself out of a hole. In Saturday's final round, however, he managed to close the gap on the leader to just one stroke before a couple of late bogeys dropped him to third.</p>
<p>Jamaican Johnny Bloomfield won with a 270 total.</p>
<p>Will Strickler was second at 277, one in front of Gligic, Robbie Greenwell and Daniel McCarthy.</p>
<p>Normally, the Q-school would wrap up the Canadian Tour season but this year they still have a couple of events left in Mexico that were postponed from the spring because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Gligic says he doubts he'll play them, however. He plans to play in a couple of Great Lakes Tour events and then start working on his game for next year.</p>

<p>Pandemic or not, hand hygiene is an effective way to reduce the spread of viruses and other germs. Raising awareness of the importance of handwashing takes on even greater importance in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>The Academy of Medicine Ottawa (AMO) represents Ottawa physicians and, as the local medical association, is working closely with Ottawa Public Health on H1N1 planning. It is impressive to see the results of the campaign on hand-hygiene measures with hand sanitizers and related posters visible in many public places including shopping malls, grocery stores, health clubs and schools where handwashing is not always convenient or accessible. This is an excellent start and more can be done to achieve improved prevention.</p>
<p>Encouraging restaurants and fast-food eateries to make hand sanitizer available to their customers in addition to providing a clean restroom for handwashing would also be helpful. Patrons could choose to apply hand sanitizer upon arrival or could be provided with a small towellette.</p>
<p>While maintaining clean surfaces such as tables, menus, and condiments is important, more prevention could be achieved by ensuring that customers are given the opportunity to limit the spread of viruses with a hand disinfectant when appropriate.</p>
<p>Eating out is a popular social activity for many of us -- restaurant owners and fast- food companies can play a positive role in helping to reduce the spread of viruses.</p>

</div><div>Jim Coyle    </div>

</p>
<p>Defending a championship, the conventional wisdom goes, is a lot harder than winning one in the first place. Once on top, there are no easy days. So a "three-peat," in any competitive endeavour, is a monumental accomplishment.</p>
<p>You might say Premier Dalton McGuinty's bid for his third straight majority, and a place in provincial history books, begins in earnest this week. Chances are most political bookies are giving slightly longer odds now against his winning again in 2011 than they were even six months ago.</p>
<p>As the Legislature returns today, the opposition leadership McGuinty will face next time out is finally in place, and the attack is certain to escalate on a government that hasn't shaken the dogs of controversy all summer.</p>
<p>Today, in his first question period as leader, it's showtime for new Progressive Conservative boss Tim Hudak - who's seen recent days serve up lots for him to work with.</p>
<p>Hudak obviously intends to try connecting the dots between the tax hit of the government's proposed harmonized sales tax, to kick in next July, and the spending scandals at eHealth Ontario and the <span class="companylink">Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp</span>.</p>
<p>How nervous the McGuinty government was about the potential public anger in that was illustrated by the hasty recent cleanout at OLG - a pre-emptive head-rolling designed to mute the issue before the Legislature spotlight resumed.</p>
<p>Hudak intends to hit hard at a government "that's become far too fat and comfortable after six years in office."</p>
<p>NDP Leader Andrea Horwath, now six months on the job, stressed similar themes. The McGuinty government, she said, has grown "increasingly arrogant and distant." The eHealth and OLG scandals saw the squandering of scarce resources - while hospitals close and special ed is cut - "on perks for well-connected insiders."</p>
<p>Today, Hudak will likely draw as much scrutiny as the government, observers looking to see if he's a credible premier-in-waiting or has more going for him than the amiable manner of a small-town real estate agent.</p>
<p>Come Thursday, all eyes will be on the by-election in St. Paul's, which holds symbolic value for all parties beyond a mere one seat. Both Hudak and Horwath have tried to turn the by-election into a referendum on the HST, road-testing the issue for 2011.</p>
<p>For McGuinty, tax reform - the competitive advantage it promises, the courage it takes to pursue - is the mast to which he's nailed his colours.</p>
<p>The challenge, he says, is to do "everything we can to strengthen this economy and create jobs," because while the recession is easing, recovery will be slow and grudging.</p>
<p>That's another reason he's so keen that November bring a victory for Toronto in its bid for the 2015 Pan Am Games and a bit of good news for him to brighten a period in which there hasn't been much.</p>
<p>To get to a third electoral victory, McGuinty will need to navigate some tough seas.</p>
<p>There's already suspicion his government's deficit will be larger than the $18.5 billion forecast. Last week, McGuinty signalled concern the federal government might fight its own soaring deficit "on the backs of the provinces" as was done in the 1990s.</p>
<p>All around him are storm cells - a boycott by defence lawyers of the Legal Aid program, worries about how committed he is to full-day kindergarten, the H1N1 threat.</p>
<p>On top of that, there's the likelihood that Deputy Premier George Smitherman will leave to seek the Toronto mayor's job and that other MPPs will opt for federal and municipal runs.</p>
<p>Hudak and Horwath haven't yet mused on the connection between rats and sinking ships.</p>
<p>But the week is young.</p>
<p>Jim Coyle's provincial affairs column appears Monday, Wednesday and Friday.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- After consistently voting against the Conservative minority government, the New Democratic Party is signalling it may allow Prime Minister Stephen Harper to continue governing rather than force an election that polls say voters don't want.</p>
<p>The House of Commons is set to resume today as the four parties continued their high-stakes game of electoral chicken – preparing for an election but looking to shift the blame for its call on their parliamentary rivals.</p>
<p>The Conservatives are expected to unveil some improvement to benefits aimed at older workers under employment insurance, while the three opposition parties have demanded greater changes, including longer coverage for workers in regions that have historically had lower-than-average unemployment rates.</p>
<p>Heading into the fall session, the NDP is sounding far less bellicose than the Liberals, whose Leader, Michael Ignatieff, has said the government's “time is up.”</p>
<p>The Liberals yesterday released new ads, including a gauzy, soft-sell effort featuring a tie-less Mr. Ignatieff standing in a forest and talking broadly about the need for better job-creation policies from Ottawa. Liberal House Leader Ralph Goodale said his party is committed to forcing an election because Mr. Harper's incompetent government has left them no choice</p>
<p>At the very least, the Liberals' hawkishness may force the NDP into the unfamiliar and unwelcome role of having to prop up the Conservatives in order to avert an election. And NDP MPs will be no more comfortable voting with Mr. Harper's government than Liberals have been since the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>NDP Leader Jack Layton said yesterday that he did not know whether the Tories' planned EI changes would be enough to avoid an election. The Conservatives could survive a confidence motion with the support of any one of the three opposition parties in the Commons.</p>
<p>“We haven't seen any details, but there is no question that the people in this recession who are really struggling the most … are those who lost their jobs,” Mr. Layton told CTV's Question Period.</p>
<p>“And we think Parliament should be working for this sort of thing – working for people and not just partisan interests.”</p>
<p>Mr. Layton said it would require some “outreach” by Mr. Harper to persuade New Democrats that he is prepared to bring a more conciliatory approach to governing with a minority. “Do these rumours [of EI changes] amount to that? I think it is too early to say.”</p>
<p>Still, NDP House Leader Thomas Mulcair echoed Conservative arguments yesterday, saying the country does not want an election when it is still struggling to emerge from a painful recession, and faces a possible health crisis with the feared outbreak of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>“I don't think that, right now, very many people would be forgiving if we were to foist a fourth general election on Canadians in five years,” Mr. Mulcair told Question Period.</p>
<p>“It's an election that would probably change nothing, that Canadians don't want, that would cost $350-million and that would come in the middle of the worst economic crisis in history with an impending flu pandemic.”</p>
<p>But he added that Mr. Harper could provoke an election by attempting to govern as if he has a majority and failing to reach out to opposition parties. He said the NDP caucus will judge the government “on a case-by-case basis” but wants to see improvements to EI and better protection for workers' pensions.</p>
<p>One possible trigger for a no-confidence vote is the government's planned ways and means motion, which must be approved by the House of Commons to formally adopt measures in last February's budget, including the home renovation tax credit.</p>
<p>Conservative strategists are eager to force the Liberals to either support the government on its budget, or precipitate an election by rejecting a motion that includes a popular measure like the renovation tax credit.</p>
<p>The Canadian Press reported last week that the Conservatives intend to table that motion on Friday, but government spokesman Dimitri Soudas said yesterday that no decision had been made on its timing.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doctors protect pay from swine flu; New Fees Mulled; Some negotiated $518 an hour to treat flu patients</b>

<div>National Post</div>
<div>1002 words</div><div>14 September 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>As they prepare to treat a possible onslaught of pandemic flu cases this fall, doctors across the country are also taking steps to shield their incomes from the ravages of the new virus and its potential fallout.</p>
<p>Several medical associations are in talks with provincial governments over special fees or subsidies to compensate physicians in the event of an H1N1-flu emergency that disrupts their practices -- and hobbles their ability to bill for services. Some are also eyeing new fees that would ensure doctors are reimbursed for a surge of extra patients.</p>
<p>The provisions range from a charge for telephone consultations with flu patients, to hourly rates of several hundred dollars for doctors who take on the influenza battle full-time to short-term insurance for those who get sick.</p>
<p>Some critics question the optics of such deals at a time when the health-care system, they argue, should be selflessly focused on the public's well-being.</p>
<p>Medical associations, however, say they only want to protect doctors from suffering financially because of a situation that is beyond their control -- and that could well threaten their health. Unlike other health-care workers, most Canadian doctors are paid a fee for each service they provide, not a guaranteed salary and overtime.</p>
<p>"It hasn't been about 'Let's take advantage of an opportunity where demand might exceed supply exponentially,' " said Kevin Chapman, director of health policy for Doctors Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>"It's about making sure patients have access to quality medical care and that physicians ... won't have to worry about finances," he said. "They're not going to make a million dollars out of this, but they're not going to be financially disadvantaged either."</p>
<p>Nurses unions are also speaking up for their members, but are focusing solely on health and safety issues around the fall flu wave, said Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses.</p>
<p>When most provinces have yet to guarantee that nurses will be equipped with high-level N-95 face masks, it does not sit well that the Alberta Medical Association, for instance, has negotiated hourly rates of as much as $518 for doctors who leave their usual tasks to deal with flu patients, she said.</p>
<p>"We're talking about health-care workers who will be working in a crisis situation, so it is very bad PR when the first item going out is these outrageous payments," Ms. Silas said.</p>
<p>The Manitoba and Prince Edward Island medical associations say they have no plans to seek special payments.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the new H1N1 flu does, in fact, come back this fall and winter with a vengeance, as some experts fear. It has been a relatively mild virus so far, yet caused more cases of serious illness and death among the young and pregnant women than the regular, seasonal influenza. A vaccine is expected to be available in Canada by November at the latest.</p>
<p>The B.C. Medical Association is pushing for two provisions to help doctors deal with a worst-case scenario. One is a new $14.74 fee for telephone consultations with patients who think they have H1N1 flu. Physicians are not paid now for routine telephone advice provided to most patients. Such calls during a flu outbreak, though, could keep some people from visiting crowded emergency wards, said Dr. Brian Brodie, the association's president.</p>
<p>The group also wants the province to lift a cap that limits the number of patients doctors see to about 50 a day, allowing them to bill for H1N1 flu patients above that number.</p>
<p>"I think doctors continue to do all they can for the good of humanity, long after it's in the interests of their own personal health," Dr. Brodie said. "You can only push that so far."</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Medical Association is seeking compensation for doctors whose practices are disrupted by the pandemic, especially if they must devote themselves full-time to flu work, said Scott Donaldson, an association spokesman.</p>
<p>The Ontario Medical Association is in talks about reimbursing physicians whose normal billings are impeded by an H1N1 outbreak, and ensuring families receive benefits if a physician dies or is disabled.</p>
<p>"We do not want members to lose income due to a public health emergency, and we want them to be made whole financially if their usual practice volumes are affected," Dr Suzanne Strasberg, the association president, says in an editorial in the most recent issue of the group's magazine.</p>
<p>Ontario doctors know well the potential impact of such crises. During the 2003 SARS outbreak, several Toronto hospitals with outbreaks were all but closed for weeks, forcing the cancellation of numerous elective surgeries and other procedures. Two nurses and a doctor died from the infection.</p>
<p>Alberta has tentatively negotiated fees for doctors who devote themselves full-time to flu treatment, ranging from $259 to $518 an hour depending on the physician's usual income, an association spokesman said.</p>
<p>The Newfoundland and Labrador Medical Association has started informal talks with the province about compensating doctors who look after patients in special flu clinics, and who become ill themselves and cannot work, said an association official.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia already has a provision in its master contract that allows the payment of an hourly rate -- an average of about $150 and equivalent to what doctors would normally earn -- if they have to leave their practices to take on other tasks, such as working in a flu-assessment clinic. Doctors Nova Scotia is also talking to the province about providing replacement income in case an H1N1 emergency bars them from performing their usual surgeries or other services, Mr. Chapman said.</p>
<p>Officials with the New Brunswick and Quebec medical associations could not be reached for comment.</p>

<p>In a novel attempt to lure back wary tourists scared off by high crime rates and last spring's swine flu outbreak, the Mexico City government is offering visitors free health and travel insurance through December.</p>
<p>The plan applies to guests at all of the city's 470 hotels and covers everything from emergency treatment at their choice of public or private hospitals to legal assistance for robberies and compensation for delayed or cancelled flights. Tourists will be given explanatory pamplets on arrival at the Mexico City airport and when they check in to their hotels, and a 24-hour call centre will offer assistance in English, Spanish, and other languages, says Juan Carlos Arnau, spokesman for Mexico City's minister of tourism.</p>
<p>Mexico City's government is paying a $30 US per person deductible for the policies, which are issued by a Spanish insurer, says Arnau. In addition to emergency medical and dental care (including ambulance transport and prescribed medicines), the coverage includes hotel stays during a traveller's convalescence, legal help for recovering lost or stolen documents and belongings, and other costs.</p>
<p>Mexico City hotel occupancy rates have climbed back to 59 per cent after plummeting to five per cent in late April, when a swine flu outbreak forced schools, government offices and businesses to shut down.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has since spread across the globe, prompting the World Health Organization to declare the first pandemic in more than 40 years.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Will flu vaccine cause reaction?; Federal officials are setting up nationwide surveillance system</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>481 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>Health officials are rushing to implement a nationwide surveillance system to detect a wide range of potential adverse reactions from the human swine flu vaccine, Canwest News Service has learned.</p>
<p>Admission lists will be searched daily at a network of hospitals across Canada for any patient with conditions that may be due to the vaccine, from allergic reactions to rare neurological complications such as Guillain-Barre syndrome, a paralyzing and sometimes fatal nerve disorder. The data will be posted to a secure web server that will allow investigators and the Public Health Agency of Canada to detect as soon as possible any potential safety risk.</p>
<p>"This is as close to 'real time' as we can get," says Dr. Allison McGeer, director of infection control at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto. "We use millions of doses of flu vaccine around the world every year. We know it's safe. But this is a slightly different vaccine and, no matter how you cut it, when you're worried about a possible reaction with a risk of one in a million, or one in 200,000, you can't do studies that prove that reaction isn't going to exist before you start using the vaccine."</p>
<p>The Serious Outcomes Surveillance Network has been under development for more than two years, driven by growing concerns over Canada's passive system of mostly relying on doctors to voluntarily report vaccine "adverse events" in adults.</p>
<p>"Nobody knows about it, nobody knows who to report to," says Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research chairman in public health policy at the University</p>
<p>of Ottawa and the Ottawa Hospital Research Insti-tute.</p>
<p>A hospital-based system to check for vaccine reactions in children has been in place in Canada for more than 17 years.</p>
<p>The new adult network was created to improve Canada's vaccine surveillance capacity and rapidly evaluate a new flu vaccine, should a pandemic hit. The network will monitor the vaccine's safety in health-care workers -- expected to be among the first to receive H1N1 flu shots -- and track flu-related hospital admissions to measure what effect the vaccine is having on reducing disease and deaths due to H1N1.</p>
<p>Both Canada and the U.S. are reporting higher than normal flu activity for this time of year. "It is a bit of a race to get the vaccine available and out there as quickly as possible ahead of the disease," said Dr. Anne Schuchat, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The new vaccine surveillance network involves seven hospitals in Vancouver, Calgary, Hamilton, Toronto, Ottawa, Quebec City and Halifax.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexico: from A to Z; Down but far from out, Mexican tourism industry heads into all-important winter season</b>
</div><div>Andrew McCredie </div>
<div>Special to the Sun</div>
<div>1792 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>J1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun </div>
</p>
<p>Premier Gordon Campbell would do well to headhunt a public relations person or two from Tourism Mexico.</p>
<p>After all, can there be anyone who has suffered the slings and arrows of misfortune more in the past year than the Latin American country's tourism industry?</p>
<p>The industry's struggles make the Liberals' ballooning deficit and deflating approval rating issues seem pretty tame by comparison. First, a worldwide economic downturn of unprecedented scope decimated the number of international travellers visiting the country; then a tiny Mexican village became ground zero for a swine flu pandemic; and now hurricanes and all-around nasty weather batters its Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>Once the skies clear, just as they have for centuries, the Mexican people will rebuild and come back better and stronger than ever.</p>
<p>As the industry heads into an all-important winter season, an improving global economic outlook should help their effort, as should airfare/accommodation deals too good for Canadian travellers to pass up.</p>
<p>If that's not enough, here's a list from A to Z of what the country has to offer.</p>
<p>Archeology</p>
<p>Get in touch with your inner Indiana Jones at any number of archeological sites, featuring pyramids, caves, lost cities and sacred sacrificial bogs. Catch one of the ancient wonders of the New World at Chichen Itza, especially during the spring or fall equinoxes when the sun's light creates a slithering serpent descending the Temple of Kukulkan. Simply otherworldly.</p>
<p>Beaches</p>
<p>Of course, reading about ancient civilizations is almost as good as being there, and there's no better place to soak up some scholarship and the sun than a Mexican beach. My personal favourites run along the Pacific Ocean, as surf big and small is never far away, and there's nothing like falling asleep to the sound of rolling waves.</p>
<p>Cancun/Cabo</p>
<p>The bona fide Spring Break capitals of Mexico -- if not the world -- the double shot of Cancun and Cabo San Lucas is party central from January through May. Tens of thousands of college students descend on the beaches and bars of these built-to-party resorts to blow off semester stresses. Be afraid. Be very afraid.</p>
<p>Diego Rivera</p>
<p>Just as the Group of Seven's stark, desolate style defines the Canadian experience, Diego Rivera's paintings define Mexico's. Much of his great works are found throughout the world's top museums and galleries, however, Mexico City's Museo Dolores Olmedo is home to a treasured Rivera collection and one well worth a visit.</p>
<p>Ecotourism</p>
<p>Sure it's a rather contrived buzzword, but ecotourism is a vibrant part of Mexico's tourism business, and judging from the ever-increasing number of operators going green, it isn't going away any time soon. One of the best tours is the Sian Ka'an Biosphere, located on the Mayan Riviera in the largest protected area in the Mexican Caribbean.</p>
<p>Festivals/fiestas</p>
<p>If there's one thing Mexicans love to do it is party, and the nation's calendar is littered with fiestas. Festivals large and small take place throughout the year and throughout the country. You've still got time to book a flight to Mexico City to catch El Día de los Muertos, the spooky Day of the Dead festival, on Nov. 2 in the city's Mixquic suburb. Once a village in its own right, it retains its rural roots and its Day of the Dead celebration is said to be one of the most colourful.</p>
<p>Golf</p>
<p>The game of golf's global explosion the past two decades has left an indelible imprint on Mexico, with some 150 courses scattered throughout the country. For a memorable golf holiday, check out El Tamarindo Beach & Golf Resort, located between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta in a 2,040-acre nature preserve. The thing about this luxury resort is even if you don't golf, you'll be blown away by the lush and undeveloped setting.</p>
<p>H1N1</p>
<p>Taking a page or two from Tourism Canada's playbook following the SARS outbreak of 2003, Mexico has been on full damage control since spring, when the so-called swine flu devastated the all-important tourism business. The upshot? Great deals for Canadian travellers. And wash your hands.</p>
<p>Isla Mujeres</p>
<p>Located a dozen kilometres from the party capital of Mexico, this tranquil island couldn't be more different from the nearby Spring Break Mecca of Cancun. Just seven kilometres long and 650 metres wide, Isla Mujeres is a great place to chill out for a day or totally unwind for a week.</p>
<p>Jalapeño</p>
<p>The little chili that launched a million heartburns is cultivated in a number of places in Mexico, but the Papaloapan River basin is where it was traditionally produced by the townspeople of Xalapa.</p>
<p>Kissing</p>
<p>Latin American countries are renowned for their homegrown lovers, but its not difficult for visitors to Mexico to find a little love in the air. Long a honeymoon destination, the country is ripe for romance.</p>
<p>Lime</p>
<p>What is it about putting a lime in a pint that makes even a rainy night in a Vancouver lounge seem a little bit of Mexico? Nearly 15 per cent of the world's limes come from Mexico, and with the fruit growing virtually everywhere in the country.</p>
<p>Mayan Riviera</p>
<p>Few stretches of waterfront anywhere in the world offer the diverse range of experiences that this 132-kilometre tourist corridor does. There are Mayan ruins in Tulum at one end, at the other a Hooters restaurant in Cancun; there are all-inclusive luxury resorts just minutes from the quaint seaside town of Playa del Carmen; and there are five-star restaurants where a dinner jacket is required and beachside stands that serve you barefoot.</p>
<p>National Palace</p>
<p>Built more than a century before the Palace of Versailles, the National Palace in Mexico City sits on a site that has served as the seat of power since the Aztec Empire. Fittingly, the main stairwell mural painted by Diego Rivera is entitled The Epic of the Mexican People.</p>
<p>Oaxaca</p>
<p>The Free and Sovereign State of Oaxaca has more than 250 kilometres of accessible beaches, but it's the colonial architecture in the capital city of Oaxaca that brings camera-toting tourists to this Pacific Coast state by the planeload.</p>
<p>Pesos</p>
<p>With the loonie translating to roughly 12 pesos currently, coupled with the fact the country's reeling tourist industry has slashed prices across the board, there's plenty of value for the Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>Quesadillas</p>
<p>There's not a Vancouver tap house worth its salsa that doesn't have this Mexican dish on the menu, but as the old saying goes, "Ain't nothing like the real thing, amigo." Best one I ever had was at an outdoor restaurant in the busy town centre of Manzanillo.</p>
<p>Riviera Nayarit</p>
<p>Located just north of Puerto Vallarta on the Pacific Coast, this new luxury resort community has quickly, and somewhat quietly, become the place to play golf in Mexico. No fewer than six championship courses are within an hour's drive of one another, and later this month the Jack Nicklaus-designed Punta Mita Pacifico course hosts a Canadian Professional Golf Tour event, the Riviera Nayarit Classic.</p>
<p>Scuba/surfing</p>
<p>From the world-class diving sites off Cozumel to the Pacific Ocean swells off Puerto Escondido, Mexico is heaven for those who like to dive below the waves and those who like to ride them. Most resorts offer scuba certification courses for beginners, while surf schools can be found up and down the Pacific coastline.</p>
<p>Tourism</p>
<p>As integral to Mexico's economy as natural resources are to Canada's, international tourism to the country has taken a battering the past year for reasons it can't control. But with more than one out of every 10 Mexican employed directly in the industry, the country is pouring resources into promoting itself around the world.</p>
<p>UNESCO</p>
<p>Mexico ranks first in the Americas and eighth in the world for the number of sites recognized in recent years by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. No fewer than 26 sites have UNESCO endorsement for their historical, cultural and natural significance.</p>
<p>Veracruz</p>
<p>Home to the highest point in Mexico -- the 5,363-metre volcano Citaltépetl -- the State of Veracruz is also home to the oldest still-standing Catholic chapel built in the Americas (in the village of La Antigua).</p>
<p>Whale watching</p>
<p>The Pacific Ocean off Mexico is a major whale highway, and an increasing number of tour operators are providing opportunities for tourists get close to these creatures. Mid-December to March is prime whale watching season, and with some tour operators using spotter planes to locate the massive marine mammals, your chances are good.</p>
<p>Xcaret Eco Park</p>
<p>Imagine if <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> built a Mayan ecological theme park and you'll have some idea what this place is all about. Featuring the flora and fauna of the Mexican southeast, including sea turtles, manatees and spider monkeys, the main attraction is a massive water park that lets you swim with dolphins and other marine life. Great for families.</p>
<p>Yucatan peninsula</p>
<p>Rich in history and culture, the Yucatan peninsula was home to the ancient Maya and boasts two of the greatest archeological sites in all of Mexico -- Chichen Itza and Tulum.</p>
<p>Zihuatanejo</p>
<p>This laid-back Pacific Coast community is part fishing village, part beach resort and is the ideal place to recharge for a week or so. For a great dining experience, check out Coconuts. And if the urge strikes for some Jell-O shooters and techno, the bright lights of Ixtapa are just a cab ride away.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>For teenagers, body-to-body contact says it all; Hugs are a basic form of communication, used to say everything from hello to 'good job'</b>
</div><div>Francine Kopun </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1076 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>L01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>Hugging is the new hello, if you're a teenager.</p>
<p>It's also good-bye, nice to see you, good job, let's chat and, even, hey, it's recess.</p>
<p>"Basically, when you become a teenager, you just hug everyone," says Casey Malvern, 13, a student at Lakeside Public School in Ajax.</p>
<p>"It really crowds up the hallways when you're trying to get to class," says Breanne Nicholson, 18, who just graduated from St. Mary's in Pickering.</p>
<p>Girls hug each other and they hug boys. The boys hug girls. Some guys say they hug their guy friends - but not at Upper Canada College, a private day and boarding school for boys.</p>
<p>"I hug girls but I don't hug guys - maybe a man-pat," says Ben Fickling, 14, a student at UCC. To demonstrate, he grabs his friend's right hand and shakes it and they bump their right shoulders together.</p>
<p>The most popular hug is the side-squeeze: Teenagers stand beside each other; they extend their arms to the side and move in for a cheek-to-cheek hug. This may sometimes be accompanied by squealing.</p>
<p>"It's like saying, 'Hi,'" says Sara Jasion, 13, of All Saints Catholic School in Mississauga.</p>
<p>The surprise hug, usually from behind, is designed to generate screams.</p>
<p>Then there's the boyfriend-girlfriend hug, which, everybody agrees, is different because it lasts longer and can involve kissing.</p>
<p>There even appear to be regional differences. According to Mackenzie Pazos and her friends at Joan of Arc High School in Barrie, guys are supposed to put their arms around a girl's waist to hug them and girls are supposed to put their arms around a guy's neck.</p>
<p>"If a guy doesn't, they get a hard time, like, 'Oh, you can't hug,'" Pazos says.</p>
<p>Hugging has become such a concern at some U.S. schools that it has been banned amid fears of allegations of harassment or improper touching. Spokeswomen for the Toronto District School Board and the Toronto Catholic Separate School Board said they were unaware of any schools that have banned hugging.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, one school district is discouraging students from hugging in an effort to stop the spread of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>But even without a ban, teachers are keeping a wary eye and a quiver of jokes to pry students apart.</p>
<p>"I would like daylight between you! A ribbon of daylight would be nice," Kate Dickson, English teacher and vice-principal of student services and admissions, tells her students at SOLA, the School of Liberal Arts. There are 95 students at the Toronto school in Grades 9 to 12.</p>
<p>Dickson says the trend has been building.</p>
<p>"Kids are feeling that they have to hug. It has become the new social imperative. I'm becoming wary of it."</p>
<p>Dickson says students who are shy or retiring or simply aren't comfortable with that kind of close physical contact can get left out of the loop. Although it doesn't happen often at SOLA - the student body is small - Dickson has seen it used to exclude others.</p>
<p>"It hasn't changed, this requirement to be popular in high school. There was always a group of people who wanted to have that squealing, screaming thing in the hall to draw attention to themselves," she says.</p>
<p>"People shouldn't have to touch one another if they don't feel like it."</p>
<p>Dickson and others attribute the trend in part to the fact that teenagers are becoming more comfortable with their bodies and express themselves with an ease and openness unfamiliar to most North American adults. Most of it is innocent, they agree.</p>
<p>Teenagers being teenagers, of course, not all of it is.</p>
<p>There is a larger concern about immodesty. Dickson has had to send young teenage girls with plunging necklines and low-waisted pants home to "get dressed."</p>
<p>She sees a desensitization happening.</p>
<p>"Young fellows in the class, on one hand, are almost getting immune to it. I notice they don't do a lot of looking because it's becoming so common now."</p>
<p>Dave Davis, principal of Bronte College of Canada, a private school in Mississauga, agrees hugging has become much more popular over the past few years.</p>
<p>"It's definitely a common sight in the school. There's no question about it. It's kind of nice to see."</p>
<p>Social worker and family therapist Gary Direnfeld sees the phenomenon as a backlash against the proliferation of "no-touch" policies that followed in the wake of horrifying revelations of child sexual abuse in the 1990s.</p>
<p>Schools, churches and groups for youth, like Scouts Canada, issued detailed guidelines governing physical contact between adults and their young charges. "A handshake is generally acceptable; a hug is sometimes acceptable; and an embrace is usually unacceptable," according to the Scouts Canada code of conduct.</p>
<p>Teachers complain that they can't even hug young children when they cry.</p>
<p>Direnfeld thinks the hugging between teenagers may have sprung up in reaction to that. He says it's not inherently inappropriate contact.</p>
<p>"Teenagers will naturally be exploring their social relationships. This is part of the adolescent norm to be touching each other," says Direnfeld, who also hosts the television show Newlywed, Nearly Dead?, on Slice Television. "But, sometimes, we as adults worry ourselves that where there's smoke, there's fire. It's silly on our part.</p>
<p>"You can certainly help kids to distinguish what's a reasonable greeting hug versus being sexually inappropriate in public, and even kids understand that difference."</p>
<p>Besides, the physical distance we like to keep between ourselves is a North American phenomenon, Direnfeld and Dickson point out.</p>
<p>"In North America, we tend to have that 12 inches of space - you invade those 12 inches and people are going to step back," says Dickson.</p>
<p>Not in other cultures. "In European culture, it's nothing new," Direnfeld says. "Everyone hugs everyone. Two Italians meet and it's a kiss on each cheek. That's the norm."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Six silver linings to our overcast summer</b>
</div><div>AL KRATINA    </div>
<div>FREELANCE</div>
<div>613 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>To say that summer is drawing to a close would imply that it began. Clearly, in Montreal at least, that's not the case. For the majority of the season, the weather has been cool, overcast, and wet, as if the whole city were taking a shower while a neighbouring town does the dishes. The end of August, on the other hand, was oppressively hot, humid, and sickly, turning even a short walk into a remarkable simulacrum of a voyage through an infected respiratory tract.</p>
<p>But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Though many Montrealers are accustomed to enjoying the summer months basking in sunshine and warmth, there were certain advantages to our recent spate of sketchy weather.</p>
<p>1. Lower energy bills</p>
<p>As I understand from skimming front-page headlines, we should be worried about the economy when not panicking about the swine flu. So, less energy wasted on running air conditioners full blast should have been great news. Particularly if you, like me, are as technically inclined as a paste-addled pre-schooler, and successfully installing a window unit without accidentally crushing the skull of a downstairs neighbour seemed unlikely.</p>
<p>2. Reduced inanity</p>
<p>Granted, nobody but dads half-cut on <span class="companylink">Coors Light</span> say "hot enough for ya?" seriously these days. But there's been a resurgence in the phrase's use by hipsters as an ironic verbal complement to a thrift store t-shirts and retro shades. Thankfully, cooler temperatures nipped that in the bud this summer.</p>
<p>3. Less annoying music</p>
<p>It's been years since I've listened to any music that wasn't recorded in some Norwegian cave by felons with pentagram neck tattoos. But I'm sure there's some sort of annoying summertime theme song circulating among high school students cruising in their parents' cars. Thankfully, weather that resembles the chorus from Gloomy Sunday discouraged the blaring of whatever single the Black Eyed Peas have out now.</p>
<p>4. Perpetuation of amusing global warming arguments</p>
<p>Sick of having to use facts when debating global warming? Same here. To amuse myself, I played devil's advocate and spiced things up with meaningless anecdotal evidence, such as "it's cold outside right now." Hey, it works for people promoting homeopathy and autism "cures" on talk shows.</p>
<p>5. Fewer men in sandals</p>
<p>I'll be the first to admit that my personal style leaves a lot to be desired, since I normally dress like I'm visiting G.G. Allin's grave on Halloween. But I cannot stand the sight of men's exposed feet, strapped into sandals like muzzled badgers. Thanks to the weather, this summer most men were forced to wear ugly but sanitary socks.</p>
<p>6. Less money spent on terrasses</p>
<p>For many Montrealers, a significant portion of the summer is normally spent sipping overpriced drinks on a downtown terrasse. But with the unpleasant weather, money must have been saved by staying at home and drinking something cheaper, like boxed wine or beer in cans roughly the size of artillery shells. If it happens again next year, I advise saving even more money by making your own booze. Since you're not using your air conditioner, throw a little orange pulp and yeast into the pool of condensed water collecting near the back. The Legionnaire's Disease bacteria likely swimming in the fluid might add an unwanted tang, but at least that'll give you something to worry about other than the swine flu.</p>

<p>A hot and steamy August gave Montreal swimwear retailer <span class="companylink">Groupe Bikini Village Inc</span>. a late summer lift, but it was too late to impact the company's second-quarter results. The H1N1 flu scare made consumers cancel sunspot vacations in May and then cold and wet weather, combined with the recession, slimmed store traffic in June and July, said CEO Yves Simard. Bikini operates 62 stores and only extra discounting could keep the garments moving. So sales for the three months ended August 1 slipped to $11.4 million from $12.8 million a year earlier, and the quarter showed a loss of $169,000 vs. earnings of $839,000 a year earlier. Comparable store sales slipped 15.9 per cent. First-half sales were $21.3 million, down from $22.7 million, and a loss of $455,000 compared with a $1 million profit in the 2008 period. But August sales surged 60 per cent to $3.2 million and comparable store sales jumped 48.7 per cent.</p>

</div><div>AARON DERFEL    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>619 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>A West Island obstetrician is outraged that he had to fight with the Lakeshore General Hospital to grant an early maternity leave to a pregnant nurse who could be exposed to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>John Bray, former chief of obstretics-gynecology at the Lakeshore, examined the patient last month. She was almost six months pregnant and had been working in the case room of the Lakeshore's maternity ward.</p>
<p>Bray said that in his medical opinion, the nurse had to go on preventive maternity leave immediately because she often comes into close contact with patients with flu-like symptoms. Given that she was in the second trimester of her pregnancy, the nurse was at a higher risk of serious complications if she contracted H1N1.</p>
<p>But the first response by the hospital's human resources department was to deny the nurse the leave and reassign her to the postpartum floor.</p>
<p>"I couldn't believe it - that they were not supporting this girl," Bray said. "The human resources department told her that if she goes off on my recommendation they won't pay her."</p>
<p>Bray added that he believed the nurse was exposed to the same risk of catching H1N1 on the postpartum floor as she was in the case room. The nurse declined to be interviewed for fear of reprisals.</p>
<p>For the past two days, as The Gazette began making inquiries, Lakeshore officials maintained that the nurse could continue to work without fear of exposure to the swine flu virus. But late yesterday, the hospital reversed it position.</p>
<p>"We're revising our policy," declared Louis-Pascal Cyr, a spokesperson for the Lakeshore and assistant to the executive director.</p>
<p>"Because of the risk of H1N1, we want to make our hospital as safe as possible for our workers. After looking into the matter, we have concluded that our pregnant workers (can go on leave)."</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Quebec public-health authorities recommended that pregnant women who work in daycares, schools and hospitals take advantage of the government's early maternity leave program to reduce the risk of catching H1N1.</p>
<p>The announcement followed the death over the summer of two Quebec women, both in the third trimester of their pregnancies, from H1N1. Authorities predict that a second, possibly more virulent, wave of H1N1 infections will hit in the coming months.</p>
<p>The provincial workplace, health and safety board already administers a program called "maternité sans danger" for pregnant women. In order to qualify for early maternity leave, a woman's doctor must make a medical recommendation to stay home.</p>
<p>The Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail reviews the recommendation and sends a certificate to the employer. The employer then has the option of granting a leave or reassigning the worker to a task that poses no risk.</p>
<p>Bray said that he received a CSST certificate, dated Aug. 27, warning that the nurse not be exposed to patients who might have H1N1 or other infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Cyr confirmed that the nurse was nevertheless reassigned to the post-partum floor. He did not specify why the hospital decided to reassign her.</p>
<p>But Bray said that the nurse was reassigned because the hospital felt that the risk of catching H1N1 on the postpartum floor was non-existent. He accused the hospital of not taking the H1N1 problem seriously.</p>
<p>Alexandra Reny, an official with the CSST, said she had never heard of a case of an employer refusing to grant a worker an early maternity leave. The CSST reviews more than 31,000 such requests each year.</p>

</p>
<p>You're outnumbered, in fear of your life, surrounded by flesh-eating zombies. What do you do? Call the mathematicians, of course.</p>
<p>Recently, a group of mathematical modellers in Canada published an academic article that examined a fictional outbreak of zombies. You may be wondering why on Earth they would do such a thing. It's all part of a larger plan to save humanity. Not just from fictional zombies, but from all the real diseases as well.</p>
<p>While modelling zombies is obviously just a bit of fun -- it arose out of a class project on disease modelling and is being published in an upcoming academic book -- there are many lessons that zombies can teach us about how to tackle real-world problems. Faced with unfamiliar biology -- in this case, the dead coming back to life -- there's a problem. You can't use existing models, because they don't apply. But time is of the essence: the zombie hordes are invading! Or, perhaps more likely, there's a new disease and it's spreading quickly.</p>
<p>First, you start with a basic model that captures the important elements of the "biology". In this case, individuals could be susceptible humans, infected zombies, or the dead, waiting to be reanimated. Then you use evidence and data to refine the model: adding in a latent period, quarantine, a possible cure, or swift, intense attacks by the army. By considering the biology hand-in-hand with the mathematics, we can refine the process until we have a fuller understanding of the situation. And the mathematics leads us to solutions: a critical quarantine level, a certain strength of drug, how often the army needs to attack the zombies. The process allows us to decide these things in advance, before the disease has spread.</p>
<p>By modelling zombies, we learn about the process of dealing with unfamiliar biology. When the zombie project was completed, it was a few months before swine flu appeared. Now there's a large-scale pandemic sweeping the world and we might need to take big decisions, often without knowing all the facts. If we wait too long, we lose our advantage. What to do?</p>
<p>Mathematical modelling can step in. The same process which leads us from the biology to the equations and back again can be applied to a new, unfamiliar disease. Or to an existing, but neglected disease. Many diseases in the developing world kill hundreds of thousands of people a year, yet they receive very little attention. For example, Chagas' Disease kills 50,000 people a year in South America -- more than the total number of death from SARS, West Nile virus and bird flu put together -- and yet it's largely unknown elsewhere. The reason? It primarily affects the poor, because the bugs that carry it can't get through plastered walls. But if your house is made of sticks, as many are in rural South America, you're at high risk.</p>
<p>Mathematical modelling can analyse intervention strategies, track the spread of the disease and determine which measures might work and which might be doomed to failure. All without costly clinical trials or long delays while data is collected.</p>
<p>Indeed, mathematical modeling has been at the forefront of diseases for a long time now. In 1911, Sir Ronald Ross used mathematical models to show that eradicating malaria was feasible, by predicting the tipping point for the number of mosquitoes you needed to kill. Malaria used to be endemic in the US, but worldwide spraying efforts almost eradicated it in the 20th century. It was the power of mathematical prediction which provided this insight -- and won Ross a Nobel prize.</p>
<p>Models have also been used to control more recent epidemics. The triple-drug cocktail that fights (but doesn't cure) HIV has given millions of people the ability to live with the disease and not develop AIDS. It was mathematicians, working jointly with biologists, who used the power of probability to realise in advance that three drugs in combination would be enough to control the disease.</p>
<p>It's true that zombies aren't real and some may consider it a waste of time to study a fictional outbreak. But learning from zombies lets us learn about life-saving cures for new or existing diseases. What's more, combining disease with zombies tells us more about ourselves, by tapping into two primal fears that humans have: being eaten by a predator and being killed by a virus. It's too bad that only one of them is fictional.</p>
<p>Zombies are a fun example of a much larger process of understanding the world. The power of mathematical modelling provides insights that we can't grasp otherwise, allows us to model hypothetical outbreaks before they occur and lets us consider a variety of potential outcomes without lengthy experiments or expensive trials. Those things are important, of course, but mathematics can light the way forward. So if the zombies do turn up, reach for the nearest calculator. It might just save your life.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Smith? (the question mark is part of his name) is an assistant professor at the University of Ottawa in the department of mathematics and the faculty of medicine whose research includes creating mathematical models of infectious disease. He is one of the authors of an academic article on mathematical modelling of zombies that can be found at: http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/~rsmith/Zombies.pdf[http://www.mathstat.uottawa.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/~rsmith/Zombies.pdf]</p>

<p>- RJ Currie, after San Diego Chargers linebacker Shawne Merriman was arrested this week for allegedly grabbing TV star Tila Tequila by the neck and tossing her down: "On hearing the news, Amy Winehouse said: 'If the Yanks arrest you for tossing down tequila, they'll put me away for life.'

<p>SAINTE-JULIE, Que.</p>
<p>Swimsuit retailer Groupe Bikini Village Inc. blamed swine flu, "unseasonable" summer weather and the recession for a loss in the second quarter.</p>
<p>The company booked a loss of $169,000, less than a penny a share, in the period ended Aug. 1, reversing net income of $839,000 (also less than a penny a share), generated in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Operating revenues were $11.4 million, down 11 per cent from $12.8 million. Groupe Bikini said its sales from the same number of stores year-over-year tumbled 16 per cent in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, it said it continues to adapt its operational approach and financial plans to match market realities, focusing on managing its inventory, capital spending, overhead and indirect costs.</p>
<p>"In the quarters ahead, we will continue to make smart strategic investments in our retail network, while carefully controlling working capital and doing everything we can to deliver efficiencies in our work," said CEO Yves Simard.</p>

<div>458 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>T04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>Canadians looking to escape the cold next winter may not get the same sweet deals as last year by waiting until the last minute, holiday operator Transat A.T. Inc. says.</p>
<p>The Montreal-based packaged tour operator and Air Transat charter airline said its enhanced offering of three-star hotels this year will allow it to compete with rivals without having to offer more luxurious hotels at the same price.</p>
<p>"The people will have what they paid for," Jean-Marc Eustache, Transat's president and chief executive officer, said during a conference call about third-quarter results.</p>
<p>"They will find less good deals this year because everybody's more reasonable about the capacity and also about the product."</p>
<p>For Transat, a better mix of hotels will mean reduced losses if it needs to cut costs to compete.</p>
<p>The company said it is also prepared to cut capacity and sacrifice market share if that is what it takes to increase its profitability amid uncertainties in next winter's key travel season.</p>
<p>Transat earned $31 million in the quarter ended July 31, as lower fuel prices and operating costs offset the impact of lower revenues in a challenging travel environment.</p>
<p>The profit amounted to 94 cents per share and compared with a loss of three cents per share in the comparable quarter of 2008.</p>
<p>Revenue was $819.4 million, down 4.7 per cent from $859.9 million in the year-earlier period, although margins improved.</p>
<p>Transat said its streamlined fleet of Airbus aircraft and partnership with CanJet will give it the flexibility to reduce capacity if demand falters. It plans to shed leased Airbus 310s and use CanJet's 189-passenger Boeing 737-800s to complement its larger Airbus 330s.</p>
<p>Eustache said the company has made a series of changes recently, including restructuring management and cutting costs to restore profits after three years of unsatisfactory results.</p>
<p>After years of boosting capacity to maintain its leading position, Transat plans to be "prudent" in light of concerns about a potential H1N1 flu outbreak and the slow economic recovery.</p>
<p>The company said it is also helped by "reasonable" efforts by the industry to maintain overall capacity near last year's levels.</p>
<p>The discontinuation of Conquest Vacations has removed some capacity and helps to offset increases planned by Air Canada Vacations and WestJet Vacations to sun destinations including Hawaii, Las Vegas and Florida where Transat doesn't compete or has minimal service, Eustache said.</p>
<p>Canadians continued to travel to Europe this summer but the number of European travellers decreased 6.5 per cent as they scaled back their trans-Atlantic trips as their economies were more adversely affected by the recession.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Companies brace for flu pandemic; Workers play critical role in preparedness</b>
</div><div>Derek Sankey   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>779 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>H1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>When an employee came back to work at <span class="companylink">McElhanney Land Surveys Ltd</span>. earlier this year after visiting Mexico, managers had the worker visit a doctor to get cleared before coming back to work to ensure the safety of its workforce and to allay fears.</p>
<p>That was the first wave. During the anticipated second wave this fall, that strategy won't work. Experts predict up to 30 per cent of the workforce could fall ill with the H1N1 influenza virus this fall and pandemic planners say most companies haven't done enough to prepare.</p>
<p>"There is no doubt that all indications are that the swine flu will hit hard," says Bob Klay, a business continuity planner with Klay Management Ltd. "Too many companies are not very prepared."</p>
<p>Many companies are lulled into a false sense of preparedness because they have some kind of policy, but the devil is always in the details and execution is what really matters in a pandemic.</p>
<p>McElhanney's health, safety and environment manager, Darrell Florence, began developing a pandemic plan in 2006 after the appearance of avian flu, or H5N1. He knows there's lots of information and pandemic plans available freely, but says the need to tailor it to every individual organization is what will make the difference when flu hits.</p>
<p>"Off-the-shelf is a great place to start, but you have to identify the risks relative your own individual business," says Florence, who has employees working at remote work camps scattered across the province who could be quarantined and office workers in Calgary and Edmonton.</p>
<p>His pandemic planning team brought in Juanita House, a registered nurse and occupational health and wellness specialist, to refine the company's pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"Anybody can get access to a pandemic policy . . . and re-word it the way they want, but does it really work the way you want when it gets down to the implementation level? You have to bring it into the business and actually make it work for people," says House.</p>
<p>Pandemic planning guidelines are available through the World Health Organization, the Public Health Agency of Canada and other organizations, but that's just a starting point from a business context.</p>
<p>Klay is holding a seminar on Sept. 16 at the Westin in Calgary to raise awareness and discuss the details with experts that include Dr. Cheri Nijssen-Jordan from Alberta Health Services (AHS), Andrew Corriveau, chief medical officer of health for AHS, an employment lawyer and an occupational health and safety specialist to help businesses prepare.</p>
<p>Accuracy and execution are critical factors to any pandemic plan, he says.</p>
<p>There are often many considerations people have not thought about or haven't addressed how to overcome if they occur. Pat Pitsel, president of consulting firm Pitsel and Associates, is also holding a pandemic planning workshop for organizations on Oct. 19 and 20 at the University of Calgary.</p>
<p>"The problem with influenza . . . is that you can be infectious, contagious, before you're symptomatic and that's where a lot of fear gets ratcheted up," says Pitsel.</p>
<p>Companies need to start with how to manage without a third of their staff, how to provide services to customers during the pandemic -people tend to stay as isolated as possible -identify critical positions in the company and cross-train to ensure continued operations and look at all aspects of operations and safety for workers.</p>
<p>Work refusals could become a problem for companies.</p>
<p>There is legislation under Occupational Health and Safety that says workers, after trying to develop a plan with their supervisors, can contact an OHS officer to get involved if there is no agreement about safety, says Florence.</p>
<p>Security is another big risk, both physical security and information technology security. Many firms plan to let employees work from home, but that poses risks, too.</p>
<p>Florence and his team, for example, have developed a virtual private network that allows workers to log in securely at home to company servers from corporate laptops.</p>
<p>Pitsel says there have already been questions raised about the Internet's ability to handle the increased traffic from a third of the global workforce working remotely.</p>
<p>With every plan, it comes down to communication with employees and getting workers on-board with doing everything they can to minimize the risks.</p>

</div><div>K. M. Butler   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>

</p>
<p>Re: Are we ready? H1N1, Sept. 5.</p>
<p>The Citizen's special edition for coverage of H1N1 was excellent and I hope will calm some of the public's fears around the virus. A sensible approach with sound hygiene will contribute to management of this challenging virus.</p>
<p>Perhaps some citizens did not have the opportunity to review your coverage as a colleague this week advised me that when she sneezed at her son's school, the principal asked her to leave the building. The irony was that the colleague had sneezed because there were perfumes in the hand sanitizer that she used upon entry to the school. When a teacher nearby also sneezed and the colleague suggested that the teacher also leave, the principal apparently was not consistent in application of the "policy." The colleague, who was quite well, did not comply with the request to leave.</p>
<p>This sort of misunderstanding will only add to the difficulties that health-care providers and parents alike will face this autumn and winter. Perhaps the provincial Ministry of Education could work with schools to implement sound policy across the province respecting potential infection with H1N1 in parents and/or students.</p>
<p>What I have noticed as a former virologist with the World Health Organization, however, is that not only in Citizen coverage, but also in Internet and national media coverage there is apparent complete lack of mention of smoking as what would be termed an underlying risk factor.</p>
<p>In the interest of public health, it should be clearly stated that smokers are at a higher risk for both initial infection as well as more severe consequences in the face of infection, as would be any children exposed to second- hand smoke. This is not a question of blame or criticism, simply a medical fact.</p>
<p>To reduce the possibility of considerably higher health-care costs, public health officials might consider placing smokers (and their children) on the list of persons prioritized to receive the H1N1 vaccine when it becomes available.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Canada is strengthening emergency stockpiles of antiviral drugs at its overseas missions so embassy and consular officials can get the same treatments for the swine flu pandemic as fellow citizens back home.</p>
<p>The federal government is buying 1,750 doses of the inhalable antiviral drug zanamivir (brand name Relenza) from GlaxoSmithKline Inc. for the foreign affairs department, according to a public procurement notice.</p>
<p>The contract gives the government the option to buy another 245,000 doses in the next two years for other departments.</p>
<p>Government contracts generally give a variety of vendors a chance to compete, but since this contract asks specifically for Relenza - which only <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> can provide - firms that make other antiviral drugs are left out on this one.</p>
<p>That includes Roche Canada and its oseltamivir (brand name Tamiflu).</p>
<p>Rodney Moore, a spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs, said there have been stockpiles abroad since 2005 but, until now, only of Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Those drugs are expiring next February and as the government refreshes the supply it is also diversifying it to resemble the mix found in emergency stockpiles across Canada, which contain Tamiflu, Relenza and an older and inexpensive flu drug called amantadine.</p>
<p>"The choice of antiviral is based on the medical professional's analysis of each person's individual need and no particular antiviral is 'favoured' over another," said Moore.</p>
<p>Moore said the Tamiflu and amantadine were ordered earlier this year.</p>
<p>Canada began adjusting its stockpiles this spring in response to concerns the H1N1 influenza virus was developing resistance to Tamiflu.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said most stockpiles around the world contain Tamiflu because it's a pill, which makes it easier to administer and store than Relenza, which is inhaled.</p>

</p>
<p>No H1N1 warning for parents - Sept. 10</p>
<p>Waterloo Region's public and Catholic school boards will not be advising parents about suspected cases of the H1N1 virus in classrooms.</p>
<p>How could such an idiotic decision be made? There are many children in every school who have specific health problems where their immune systems are generally low and at risk for every sickness around.</p>
<p>This virus has proven to be deadly yet we won't be told of suspected or real cases. The public health authorities say it's not practical. The children must practice proper hygiene and wash hands constantly. What a joke. Where and when?</p>
<p>If and when the virus hits the area, the parents have the right to know and make their own decisions on whether to send their children to school or not. It is much easier and cost effective to close the schools for the length of time that the virus needs to run its course than have the schools half full.</p>
<p>As a parent, it is my decision on whether my children attend during the outbreak of the virus, if and when it comes. I will find out through other sources if the health and school boards choose not to advise of cases. Just what do you think the parents gathered in the school playgrounds talk about anyhow?</p>
<p>We have rights, folks, and we must not have them nullified because the health authorities and school boards choose to intentionally withhold information regarding the safety and health of our children. Stand up, be heard. Let your child's principal know that he or she has an obligation to advise of this potentially life threatening virus. There are legal implications here.</p>
<p>Be informed and make your own decision.</p>

<p>Ellen DeGeneres is going to be a new judge on American Idol. Its not official yet - it has to get approved by the Senate. Ellen DeGeneres is replacing Paula Abdul. Don't be worried about Paula Abdul though - she's going to be running for governor of Alaska.</p>
<p>Speaking of running, Dick Cheney might be running for President in 2012. Well, you gotta start somewhere. . .</p>
<p>Conan O'Brien</p>
<p>Republican Congressman Joe Wilson has apologized for calling President Obama a liar during his speech on health care. Obama accepted Wilson's apology, then invited him to appear before a death panel.</p>
<p>During last night's health care speech President Obama told Republicans "the time for games has passed." Obama had to say that because most Republicans were on their BlackBerrys playing "Brick Breaker."</p>
<p>Earlier today, President Obama gave another speech about health care - this one to a room full of nurses. Still no word on what Bill Clinton was doing there.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Florida Sen. Mel Martinez, the only Hispanic Republican in the Senate, officially stepped down. The Republican senator who replaced Martinez thanked him and then had him deported.</p>
<p>Craig Ferguson</p>
<p>Ellen DeGeneres has been named the new judge on "American Idol." She's now the second most powerful lesbian on the planet, the first, of course, being Kim Jong Il.</p>
<p>President Obama gave a speech last night on health care. At one point, Congressman Joe Wilson yelled out during the speech, "You Lie!" Until then, the speech was just normal, and by normal I mean boring. It caused a commotion. All the rest of the politicians were like, "How does he know?"</p>
<p>Jimmy Kimmel</p>
<p>President Obama made his health care address to Congress. It went pretty well, except for one weird part in the middle when a congressman from South Carolina suddenly yelled out, "You lie!" It's amazing - this guy was able to sit through seven years of President Bush telling him everything in Iraq was fine.</p>
<p>Even fellow Republicans were horrified at the outburst. He apologized immediately after the speech, saying he was watching Gossip Girl on his iPhone and got angry at the show.</p>
<p>Oprah Winfrey is getting ready for her new show. Today they had what they called a kickoff party on Michigan Avenue in Chicago and I guess they closed down the whole street. The Black Eyed Peas, Jennifer Hudson, and James Taylor were all summoned to perform by Oprah. They were happy to do her bidding.</p>

</p>
<p>Margaret Atwood has barely begun discussing her new novel The Year of the Flood in an out-of-the-way corner of L'Espresso Bar Mercurio when a woman of a certain age tentatively sidles up, glances down at the digital recorder on the table and apologizes for the interruption.</p>
<p>The beaming expression on the intruder's face suggests an acolyte of some considerable devotion.</p>
<p>Well, yes, although not entirely, since it's obvious from the woman's introduction of herself that she is in some way acquainted with the famous writer sitting across the table.</p>
<p>Atwood fixes a curious gaze. The woman identifies herself. Atwood laughs delightedly, the moment of recognition instantly brightening her face.</p>
<p>"I haven't seen you since ..." Atwood says, leaving a long enough pause for the interviewer to imagine when that might have been.</p>
<p>Last year's Book Lover's Ball, perhaps? Atwood's onstage interview with Ian Rankin two years ago at the International Festival of Authors? A congregation of birding enthusiasts in the company of her naturalist spouse, Graeme Gibson, during one of the migratory seasons at Point Pelee?</p>
<p>"...1954."</p>
<p>The woman politely reminds the author that they were in the same grade at Leaside High School and therefore graduated at the same time. So it couldn't have been 1954. Okay, then, 1957.</p>
<p>Atwood inquires after the woman's brother. A doctor? Yes, obstetrics. And the two former classmates make their goodbyes.</p>
<p>Less than an hour later, the famous author is standing on a stone slab in front of the same restaurant having her picture taken. A wide-brimmed hat shields her face from the searing sun, but doesn't provide sufficient cover to prevent recognition by the young, star-struck couple walking along Bloor St. W.</p>
<p>The young woman jumps up, throws her arm around the writer's shoulder and both women smile into the camera. Then the young woman's more reticent male accomplice, bidden by Atwood herself, does the same.</p>
<p>The young people are so thrilled by the encounter that it either doesn't occur to them or they don't care that they won't come away from the experience with anything more than the memory of it, since neither of them is actually taking the picture.</p>
<p>The interviewer, admittedly more than a little astonished by this point, is thinking: Can this really be the Margaret Atwood who invented the LongPen so she could sign stacks of books for readers who are so far away they might as well be on the moon?</p>
<p>Well, yes.</p>
<p>Since the introduction three years ago of the LongPen, a device that enables authors to sign books from anywhere, Atwood has used technology to cultivate a relationship with her reading public that might be characterized as providing the appearance of intimacy, but at a safe remove.</p>
<p>She blogs. She tweets. She had a direct hand in the creation of a website for The Year of the Flood, a companion volume to 2003's dystopian Oryx and Crake.</p>
<p>Atwood's fans can visit the site (yearoftheflood.com) to get information about the ambitious and inventive promotional tour for the book, or to find out how things are going as she makes her way from event to event.</p>
<p>Aversion to personal contact does not appear to be the motivation, however, if her encounters with an old friend and a couple of young strangers are anything to go by. It's not a matter of arrogance or aloofness. Atwood, who turns 70 in a little more than two months, is simply conserving her energy.</p>
<p>The promotional tour, a six-country trek launched in the U.K. last month, is a case in point. Instead of a conventional lectern reading, Atwood and her accomplices, including director Alisa Palmer, have devised an elaborate program of dramatic readings from The Year of the Flood, as well as choral performances of the original hymns that punctuate the novel. The road show, continuing into November, resumes in Canada this month, including a Sept. 24 stop at Toronto's St. James Cathedral.</p>
<p>"If I had to go and give hour-long readings in each of these places, I wouldn't make it. My voice would not make it through," says Atwood, who plays the role of the narrator in the performances.</p>
<p>"As it is, we're going to see whether I can get through this or not. It would be an astonishing feat for somebody half my age. The beauty is that a lot of people are helping. It's an unprecedented experience. And not repeatable. Not repeatable by me, at least."</p>
<p>Technically, The Year of the Flood is not a sequel to Oryx and Crake, which told the postapocalyptic story of a world reduced to ruins when a plague is unleashed by out-of-control genetic experimentation. Atwood calls The Year of the Flood a "simultaneal," since the time frame overlaps with Oryx and Crake and some of the characters from that earlier book reappear. Atwood has tentative plans for a third volume, with the stated qualifier that "you can never predict the future" - a strange proviso coming from a writer who seems to make a habit of doing just that.</p>
<p>"I speculate about the future but I can't predict it any more than anybody else can," she corrects. "There are too many variables. You can only say 'maybe.' It's like the weather."</p>
<p>Where Oryx and Crake focused mainly on the corporate industrial complex responsible for the genetically engineered calamity that befalls humanity, The Year of the Flood presents the alternative universe of God's Gardeners, a cult of vegetarian nature lovers whose theology combines elements of Christianity with a worship of latter day eco-saints such as Al Gore, David Suzuki and Euell Gibbons.</p>
<p>"They are at the bottom end of what happens when everything becomes a commodity and when the government and commerce become the same entity," Atwood says. "We've taken a great leap toward that melding with support to the banks, government owning parts of car companies. It makes me shudder.</p>
<p>"Government stepping in is one thing. Government becoming owner of a business is another. Then you're likely to end up with what I call 'the Polish overshoe problem.' Before the wall came down, people in Poland had jobs making overshoes, but nobody needed that many overshoes. So you had an overshoe mountain."</p>
<p>The Year of the Flood is Atwood's 13th novel. The number of short story and poetry collections penned by her since 1961's Double Persephone are also in the double digits, to say nothing of the numerous non-fiction titles, including the influential CanLit critique Survival, and stories for children.</p>
<p>As on previous occasions when Atwood has cast her mind forward - most famously in The Handmaid's Tale - her vision of the future is grounded in a recognizable extension of our present reality. We don't yet have rakunks - the half-raccoon, half-skunk crossbreeds of the author's fictional world - but scientists have bred goats with spider DNA in their genetic makeup.</p>
<p>"It's not voyage to Planet X on a spaceship," says Atwood of her approach to science fiction. "It's not talking lizards. It's not ET.</p>
<p>"It's our planet. Things we have the power to do. Things we've already done that people just didn't know about."</p>
<p>Atwood's frequently cited prescience remains remarkable - even if sometimes abetted by the fickle finger of fate. The Year of the Flood was to come out at this time last year, but circumstance dictated that she publish the non-fiction title Payback instead. And so, with the financial world collapsing around our RRSPs, Atwood was on the bestseller lists with a book about the perils of debt. Now that we're facing a fall flu season complicated by fears of H1N1, she has returned to the subject of plague.</p>
<p>"I may be wrong, but it doesn't sound like the total biggie, unless it mutates," Atwood predicts. "A lot of people are getting a fairly mild form. Some people are saying it's going to be back in the fall and it's going to be worse. We'll see."</p>
<p>Not that she is taking any chances. Atwood is mindful that at a time when others might be choosing to restrict their movements for fear of catching a potentially lethal bug, she will be on the road communing with her readership.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that she is travelling prepared. "I'm packing a lot of hand sanitizer," she says.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu-season fêtes: How to avoid going viral; Whether you're at a film-fest gala or your own party, remember Mom's advice. Wash up before eating. And no double-dipping!</b>

</p>
<p>Not since the famous Seinfeld episode has double-dipping been so ripe for debate.</p>
<p>In a show first aired in 1993, George Costanza gets called out at a party for loading his tortilla chip twice at the dip bowl. “That's like putting your whole mouth right in the dip!” another guest tells him.</p>
<p>“I'll dip the way I want to dip,” George replies unrepentantly – and then dips again.</p>
<p>Ew.</p>
<p>Normally, this behaviour would simply be uncouth. But with cases of H1N1 expected to rise substantially this fall, more people are likely to speak up about double-dipping – or they'll avoid dipping at all. Indeed, for some, “social distancing” may be the new social networking.</p>
<p>This weekend, as Toronto's entertaining season kicks off with a whirl of film-fest parties, swine flu is most definitely taking a back seat to celeb-spotting. But behind the scenes, some caterers are adjusting the way they plate and serve food, while etiquette experts are considering the implications of handshakes and cheek-kissing.</p>
<p>“I don't want to be alarmist, but the plain fact of the matter is it's human nature to double-dip,” says Ted Allen, a New York-based food and lifestyle expert who devoted a segment of his show Food Detectives to snacking faux pas (he can currently be seen on Chopped, a new race-against-the-clock cooking competition on the Food Network).</p>
<p>But if there's anything more unsettling than catching a double dipper in action, it might be a server in a face mask.</p>
<p>“That doesn't exactly say hospitality, does it?” says Allen, who was in Toronto recently.</p>
<p>And therein lies the key challenge of flu-season entertaining: being cautious without spoiling the party.</p>
<p>For Michael Garam, the director of infectious diseases at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, the message is simple: Use common sense. “People should have their parties,” he says. “But if you're home and you're hacking up a lung and you have a fever, don't go.”</p>
<p>Because the virus is respiratory and cannot live in the gastrointestinal tract, Garam is not overly worried about food being a vector. “If someone is serving a soufflé and coughs, the organism will live there, yes,” he says, adding that you're much more likely to be infected by someone coughing on a surface that you touch with a finger that then rubs your eye.</p>
<p>Cindy Post Senning, great-granddaughter of etiquette maven Emily Post and a director of the Emily Post Institute, agrees that the onus is on everyone to be his own first line of defence, from washing hands frequently to doing the sleeve sneeze.</p>
<p>But what happens if a hand that just caught a cough is then extended in greeting? “If a $10-million contract is on the line, I might shake that person's hand,” she says. It goes without saying that you wash your hand at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<p>But don't play favourites, she says by phone from Burlington, Vt. “If you take that tack, take that tack and say, ‘Right now while this epidemic is on, I really would rather not, but I'm so delighted to meet you.' Be honest with everyone in the room. What I wouldn't do is say no to one person and yes to the next.”</p>
<p>And yes, it's okay to discourage double-dipping. “I do think in an atmosphere where we're trying to stop the spread, you can say, ‘We're asking people not to double-dip.' … You don't want to put someone down, but I think you can fall back on it.”</p>
<p>Caterers are also making efforts to educate employees about how the H1N1 virus spreads, which, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's website, is through “inhalation of the virus expelled by infected individuals when coughing or sneezing and by touching any surface that is contaminated with the virus and then touching the mouth, nose or eyes.”</p>
<p>As Jackie Brown, manager of operations for Eatertainment, a special events and restaurant company in Toronto, says, “the main point for us is that it's not caused by the food but by the people handling it.” Last year, all senior managers at the company were recertified in food-handling safety. Hand sanitizers are now a staple in chefs' kits.</p>
<p>While Brown has drafted a memo to staff about knowing H1N1 symptoms and taking precautions, he doesn't want to overplay the risks. “I think the big thing is not to set that level of fear. It's the flu; we deal with the flu every year.”</p>
<p>Dee Gibson of Toronto-based Catering With Style says offering food that is “self-contained” can make the difference between people passing around the hors d'oeuvre and passing on them.</p>
<p>Long before H1N1, she had been spacing canapés at least an inch and a half apart. She uses skewers to minimize finger contact and, in the case of poached shrimp, dollops sauce onto a small individual serving plate with the shrimp placed on top, no dipping required.</p>
<p>Gibson points to the SARS outbreak of 2002-03 as a wakeup call to the Toronto hospitality industry. “People just didn't go out and didn't entertain; they were cancelling and not rebooking until things calmed down,” she says. “There was a six-week period when things went dead for everyone.”</p>
<p>Restaurateurs Guy and Michael Rubino also paid attention to SARS and have tweaked their new Toronto restaurant accordingly. Ame, which opened last month in the location of their previous hot spot, Rain, features wood-beam accents and moody lighting. With the look of an industrial temple, it's set to be a busy film-fest destination (a post-screening party for Demi Moore and David Duchovny's movie The Joneses is set to unfold there tomorrow night).</p>
<p>But the open kitchen is equipped with five more sanitation stations than previously and, when people request chopsticks, they now receive a disposable set. “I think you need to go to places where you're sure standards are being met,” Michael Rubino says.</p>
<p>While a sensible proprietor would never allow a sick person to prepare or serve food, symptoms can start off so mildly that some people may continue to work. Then there are the old chef's habits – dipping a finger into a sauce or reusing a spoon for tasting – that may be too ingrained to shake. After all, “cooking is a soulful act of loving and sharing,” Allen points out.</p>
<p>By the same token, Rubino would be loath to discourage diners from sharing dishes from the Japanese-inflected menu. “As humans, we like to socialize,” he says. “What are we going to do, go hide under a rock?”</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>Expert tips</p>
<p>Single servings</p>
<p>“Instead of having crudités with a bowl of <span class="companylink">Hidden Valley Ranch</span> in the middle,” food-show host Ted Allen says, “I think it's a great idea to make individual canapés. It's a lot more work, but if this is something you're concerned about, it's a smart way to approach it.”</p>
<p>Dee Gibson of Catering with Style in Toronto often uses skewers to reduce finger contact. “Although it becomes a waste issue, you need something like that when you don't want people touching and cross-contaminating the food,” she says.</p>
<p>Asian soup spoons with flat bottoms allow sauce and food to marry in a self-contained space.</p>
<p>Be consistent</p>
<p>If you plan to decline handshaking or cheek-kissing, ensure that you don't make any exceptions, says Cindy Post Senning of the Emily Post Institute. “Never say no to one person and yes to the next. Remember to do what's respectful and honest.”</p>
<p>Space out items</p>
<p>Gibson recommends spacing hors d'oeuvre at least an inch and a half apart.</p>
<p>Discourage double-dipping</p>
<p>Have a server dish it out if there is a single bowl of food at a serving station. If a server sees someone double-dipping, the dip should be replaced. This means having extra.</p>
<p>Cleanliness, cleanliness</p>
<p>Post Senning recommends supplying powder rooms with plenty of soap, hand sanitizer and paper towels. “People will be more conscious that way.” And have plenty of fresh wineglasses; the rule is three per guest.</p>

</p>
<p>The race to become the next premier of Manitoba became more defined Friday as the three NDP leadership hopefuls showcased who's supporting their bids to replace Premier Gary Doer.</p>
<p>Two of the three, Greg Selinger and Steve Ashton, staged public announcements while Andrew Swan sent out a simple bulletin. Ironically, it was Swan who got the biggest boost in support.</p>
<p>Three cabinet ministers climbed aboard Swan's campaign bandwagon: Justice Minister Dave Chomiak, Education Minister Peter Bjornson and Infrastructure and Transportation Minister Ron Lemieux.</p>
<p>Swan said their support is crucial as Bjornson and Lemieux both represent rural ridings and Chomiak has long been a senior minister and government house leader. Six cabinet ministers now endorse Swan.</p>
<p>"This is an indication people see me as someone who can lead," Swan said.</p>
<p>Selinger used the backdrop of a Henderson Highway Salisbury House to announce Elmwood MLA Bill Blaikie has endorsed his leadership bid.</p>
<p>"He and I go back to when we were both community activists in the late '70s in the inner city," Blaikie said. "We worked closely together over the years and I look forward to working with him as the premier of Manitoba.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping that people who have some respect for my judgment in these matters will take this into account."</p>
<p>Selinger said in the coming days more high-profile people will endorse him as the leadership campaign heads toward the Sept. 17 cut-off date for party membership sales.</p>
<p>The voting strength of each of the province's 57 districts will be determined by the number of members it has 30 days before the convention. Organized labour will receive 20 per cent of the eligible delegate spots at the Oct. 16-17 leadership convention in Winnipeg. Voting is to be done by secret ballot.</p>
<p>The only cabinet ministers who have not endorsed a candidate are Family Services and Housing Minister Gord Mackintosh, Water Stewardship Minister Christine Melnick and Science and Technology Minister Jim Rondeau.</p>
<p>"There are several weeks to go and I don't think anybody should take anything for granted no matter what the endorsements are," Selinger said. "Right now it's about reaching out to people in the community and building membership."</p>
<p>Doer, who spent part of the week in Ottawa being briefed for his new job as Canada's ambassador to the United States, has stayed silent on who he'd like to see replace him.</p>
<p>Ashton was at city hall to introduce his new campaign chairman, Transcona city councillor Russ Wyatt, and to say that if he becomes premier, he'll introduce legislation to protect the city's water supply from being privatized.</p>
<p>Ashton said he was unfazed by the cabinet support Swan has gained since being first out of the starting blocks in the leadership race.</p>
<p>"What you see here today is a candidate talking about vision and ideas," Ashton said. "That's the hallmark of our campaign."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tory Leader Hugh McFadyen said the leadership campaign conflicts with the start of the four-week legislative session that begins Monday.</p>
<p>"We've got the three-ring circus of the leadership campaign underway, which has just about everyone in cabinet preoccupied," he said.</p>
<p>He said the province faces tough challenges like the harmonized federal tax proposal, the H1N1 flu outbreak and mounting crime and gang problems.</p>
<p>"It's walking, chewing gum and bouncing a basketball at the same time," McFadyen said. "The people of Manitoba are looking for leadership on a whole bunch of important issues."</p>
<p>However, Deputy Premier Rosann Wowchuk said the work of government continues despite the leadership campaign and without Doer.</p>
<p>"I can bounce a ball, too," she said. "I've multi-tasked many times before."</p>
<p>Wowchuk added the government held its first cabinet meeting this week without Doer and released details on how it will combat the expected H1N1 flu outbreak this fall.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Storms, sickness, and other travel nightmares -</b>
</div><div>By Ron Pradinuk / Ask Journeys   </div>
<div>982 words</div><div>12 September 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>E2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>We really don't like to think of storms, or getting sick, or becoming victims of crime when we travel, but I often get questions relating to these events. Today's column will address some of these concerns.</p>
<p>QUESTION: What happens if you are on a cruise ship and a hurricane starts to form in the pathway of your itinerary?</p>
<p>ANSWER: For most Manitobans, the hurricane season has passed before they walk onto the gangplank of the ship they have chosen for their great escape. By the end of December, when we really start having our presence felt on cruise ships traveling around the south, we usually only have to worry about taking in too much sun and consuming too much food from the midnight buffets.</p>
<p>For those who like to take advantage of the lower prices that are available in the fall, there is always a chance that a major storm or hurricane can arise.</p>
<p>When this happens, cruise ships will most often adjust their itineraries accordingly.</p>
<p>Even though Hurricane Jimena fizzled out before it did any major damage, cruise lines had already taken action to avoid its projected path.</p>
<p>For example, the Carnival Splendor sailed on to Catalina Island rather than its intended stops in Puerto Vallarta and Mazatlan.</p>
<p>Royal Caribbean's Mariner of the Seas reversed the order of its sailing from its original schedule to give time for the storm to pass.</p>
<p>When Hurricane Katrina struck with such devastating force a few years ago, a number of vessels were caught on the edges of those huge waves and winds.</p>
<p>While cruise ships today, with the help of stabilizers that keep the movement onboard steady, sail smoothly in most conditions, there is no technology that can help buffer the forces of a hurricane.</p>
<p>I had a chance to talk with crew members from one of the Holland America ships who were working during those few days. It ended up being a pretty horrible experience for all aboard.</p>
<p>Not only were passengers getting seasick, but crew members were as well.</p>
<p>Those passengers who were well enough to make it to the dining rooms found servers who could not keep meals on their trays because of the violent pitches of the ship. They reported that the dining room looked like it had been through a flying food fight.</p>
<p>Most people, if they did eat, wanted room service. The kitchen and crew could not keep up with the room service requests.</p>
<p>In the end everyone survived, with harrowing stories to tell that had nothing to do with their personal security, but with much to relate about the overall experience.</p>
<p>Luckily, this degree of anxiety is usually prevented by early warnings of impending hurricanes, along with cruise-line experience in recognizing and acting quickly to modify itineraries.</p>
<p>QUESTION: I am determined not to make fears about H1N1 flu stop me from vacationing this winter, but at the same time I don't want to do anything foolish. Do you have any suggestions?</p>
<p>ANSWER: H1N1, as this strain of flu is now named, could arise in Canada as easily as any other country.</p>
<p>There is no question that health organizations around the world will be on the watch for major outbreaks as the normal flu season approaches.</p>
<p>Health experts say concern about this flu is not reason enough to avoid making travel plans, but there are ways to minimize your exposure.</p>
<p>Most importantly, the repeated advice to practice good hand hygiene by washing well and often is paramount.</p>
<p>Carry hand sanitizers with you for times when you cannot easily access a washroom.</p>
<p>Find out what's happening in the countries you hope to visit and learn how they plan to deal with the virus if it does become widespread.</p>
<p>Certain higher-risk groups, which include young children, pregnant women and people with weak immune systems, should consult their physicians before going to areas where there are reports of increased flu activity.</p>
<p>Clearly though, personal cleanliness is the first line of defence for prevention at home or on the road.</p>
<p>QUESTION: What do you suggest is the best way to ensure my money and I are not separated by thieves when I travel abroad?</p>
<p>ANSWER: I get asked this question often and have relayed some advice in past columns. I think the most important thing to recognize is that most of the time tourists are not confronted and robbed. Rather they are victims of professional pickpockets or scam artists.</p>
<p>The most important thing you need to do is separate your money from yourself before thieves get a chance to do so.</p>
<p>If you carry credit cards, keep one or two in your safety-deposit box in your room or at the front desk, and only carry one or two with you. That way, you have a backup should one be stolen.</p>
<p>Secondly, do the same with your cash.</p>
<p>Keep some cash in your pocket or wallet, but make sure you have a good waist wallet or neck safe or any of the other options you can easily find at most travel outlets.</p>
<p>Don't flash cash, as that makes you an automatic target. As obvious as that may seem, we need to recognize that what for us may not be a significant amount of money, in poor countries may be a lot, and well worth the pickpocket's pursuit.</p>
<p>While your questions referenced cash only, remember that your expensive jewelry should be left at home, or worn only in places you know are secure.</p>

<p>H1N1: when it broke back in April, I was in the eye of the storm. The heart of the action. The centre of the burrito.</p>
<p>Mexico.</p>
<p>My group of Canadian travel journalists was calmly taken aside by a Mexican Tourist Board representative and given a debriefing that began with something to the effect of: "Now don't freak out, but ..."</p>
<p>At that point, though, the severity of the virus hadn't hit home. A few days later, we connected through Mexico City's airport and, bam, the panic response kicked in. That's what happens when one in three people are wearing surgical masks and your breathing holes are naked. Canadian customs in Toronto was offered no solace: the masked agents looked equipped to languish in a mustard gas sauna.</p>
<p>Like any normal individual, during the two- to seven-day incubation period that followed, I convinced myself that I had swine flu. Was my, um, particularly aqueous waste more than just an average Mexican souvenir? Was the minor tickle in my throat a sign to go coffin shopping -- or was it just a shard of popcorn I ate at the movie theatre (where I might have spread the pandemic to 50 innocent people who just wanted to see Anvil: The Story of Anvil)?</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had another encounter with H1N1's global impact. I was en route to Macedonia, and of course H1N1 crossed my mind so I washed my hands frequently and resolved not to make out with any strangers on the plane (believe me, it was challenging given the romantic mood set by a choir of screaming babies).</p>
<p>At Skopje's miniscule airport, a crew of doctors in lab coats was hastily tacking up signs that instructed certain citizens -- including Canadians -- to pick up a piece of paper that ordered a checkup at a medical clinic.</p>
<p>Now, as fears mount about a possible second strain of the virus circulating this fall, people ask whether I'm going to curtail my travels. Or, at the very least, order a mask, gloves and coverall suit from www.fluarmour.com[http://www.fluarmour.com]. Maybe some disinfectant spray, too.</p>
<p>The answer to all of the above is: no. As long as we're healthy, there's no reason to stop travelling until the government tells us to.</p>
<p>People already cough up so many excuses for not travelling: money, time, language barriers. Adding negative hype to that list only succeeds in wasting your own opportunities to get out there and live. Just think about everyone who quaked in their slippers and stayed put for years post 9-11.</p>
<p>I hope to meet you on a flight in the near future. But, uh ... keep the handshake to yourself, please.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Jays tired of losing</b>

<p>Toronto Blue Jays manager Cito Gaston strolled through the Comerica Park visitor's dugout sipping a soft drink, when he stopped and coughed.</p>
<p>"Swine flu?" a passer by wondered.</p>
<p>"I hope not," Gaston said.</p>
<p>Considering how Blue Jays have fallen this season, would a bout of illness be all that surprising?</p>
<p>As the Jays began a four-game set with a 6-4 win over the American League Central Division-leading Detroit Tigers Friday, the juxtaposition of the two teams since they last met was stark.</p>
<p>Toronto opened the season taking three of four from Detroit at the Rogers Centre. When the Tigers left town, the Jays stood atop the powerful AL East.</p>
<p>"People were really happy and I think a little bit surprised in the way we played," Gaston recalled.</p>
<p>As late as May 23, the Jays still resided in the penthouse, though by then, it was becoming apparent that they couldn't keep up the rent payments.</p>
<p>In the midst of a nine-game losing skid at the time, a 10-2 drubbing at the hands of the Atlanta Braves May 24 knocked these birds off their perch.</p>
<p>By the end of their slump, the Jays resided in third place in the division, and like the</p>
<p>Titanic, they've continued to sink deeper.</p>
<p>"When you lose nine in a row, then you feel like something's happening," Gaston said. "Something's going on there."</p>
<p>What was going on was that a team that had been playing over its head finally succumbed to reality.</p>
<p>"We had four guys hitting in the .350s, .360s for a while, and you know that's going to come down," Gaston said.</p>
<p>"And the bottom part of the lineup just wasn't producing the way it should.</p>
<p>"That hurt us a lot, too, along with having a bunch of kids pitching. We had a lot of injuries to pitchers. We've had</p>
<p>11 or 12 different starters this year."</p>
<p>In the midst of their slide, there was the circus surrounding the club's attempt to deal ace right-hander Roy Halladay, as the former Cy Young Award winner's life played out like a sports-page soap opera.</p>
<p>There are some bright spots. Left-fielder Adam Lind (97) and second baseman Aaron Hill (94) are on the brink of 100 RBI seasons.</p>
<p>Lind leads the AL with 74 extra-base hits.</p>
<p>At the same time, there is much concern about Toronto's sputtering prospect pipeline, once the envy of baseball.</p>
<p>"We've got to do a better job of developing young hitters," admitted Tony LaCava, Toronto's director of player personnel.</p>
<p>At 64-77, the Jays are cruising toward an end to their 15th successive campaign absent of post-season play.</p>
<p>Among major-league teams, the only ones with longer playoff droughts are the Pittsburgh Pirates (1992), Kansas City Royals (1985) and Washington Nationals, who were still the Montreal Expos the last time they made the playoffs in 1981.</p>
<p>Most teams wear throwback jerseys.</p>
<p>The Jays deploy a throwback manager. Gaston was also in charge when the club won back-to-back World Series in 1992-93.</p>
<p>"People run into me and say, 'Cito, thank you for the memories,'" Gaston said.</p>
<p>Memories that included several Detroit-Toronto showdowns for AL East supremacy, many which ended in Blue Jay heartbreak.</p>
<p>"It is kind of a shame," Gaston said of the two teams now being situated in opposite divisions.</p>
<p>"I remember families used to drive up here.</p>
<p>"There were a lot of people who'd come to see us. And also, there were a lot of people on the other side of that (Ambassador) bridge who were Detroit fans.</p>
<p>"It was great, except for losing all of the time."</p>
<p>Losing all the time has become a Blue Jays trademark.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccinate now to curtail swine flu, study warns; Spread of H1N1 expected to peak by mid-October</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>328 words</div><div>11 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>Human swine flu will begin spreading substantially any day now, peak in mid- to late October and infect 32 per cent of the population, according to a new study on the potential impact of the anticipated fall wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>Reporting in the journal Science, U.S. researchers say schoolchildren need to be immunized as quickly as possible to curb H1N1's spread. They estimate each infected child will infect 2.4 other children in a school outbreak, putting H1N1 in the "higher range of transmissibility" for influenza.</p>
<p>Aggressive vaccination of the population should focus on children ages six months to 18 years as much as possible, the team says, as well as health-care workers, emergency-services workers and those at risk for complications of the flu, in order to reduce attack rates, hospitalizations and deaths from the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century.</p>
<p>The study suggests vaccines may come too late to blunt the fall wave of H1N1 infections. However, starting vaccinations in mid-October would still be effective if swine flu peaks in November or December, as it did during the Hong Kong flu of 1969.</p>
<p>Still, their projections are an ominous warning for Canada.</p>
<p>The current plan calls for vaccinations to start in early November -- one month after the anticipated peak. The researchers say H1N1 will mostly likely follow the pattern of the Asian flu pandemic in 1957-58, rising in September and peaking in October.</p>
<p>"You've got to get [vaccination] started right away in the high-risk population and you have to hope that you're going to get the coverage rate you're desiring," says Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research Chair in public health policy at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. "If these people are right, Canada is not going to look too good in the long run."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How the latest signs point to global recovery taking shape</b>
</div><div>Virginia Galt </div>

</p>
<p>Clear signals of recovery are now visible in most major economies, the Paris-based Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development said Friday in releasing its composite leading indicators for July. China reported stronger-than-expected economic output, Japan reported second-quarter growth, although the economy remains fragile. And Brazil made a stronger-than-expected exit from the recession in the second quarter, government data showed Friday.</p>
<p>A global recovery? Yes, but not a forceful one, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said in a new economic forecast.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the most recent batch of indicators, and what the economists say:</p>
<p>OECD: Recovery gains momentum</p>
<p>The 30-member OECD reported its composite leading indicators for July show stronger signs of recovery.</p>
<p>“Clear signals of recovery are now visible in all major seven economies, in particular in France and Italy, as well as in China, India and Russia. The signs from Brazil, where a trough is emerging, are also more encouraging than in last month's assessment,” the OECD said.</p>
<p>The OECD said its composite leading indicators index tracks components that target the early stages of production, respond rapidly to changes in economic activity and are sensitive to expectations of future activity.</p>
<p>The OECD defines any growth above the 100-mark as expansion. Any growth below the 100-mark is deemed to be a sign of recovery.</p>
<p>The composite leading indicator for the OECD area rose to 97.8 in July from 96.3 in June.</p>
<p>For the major industrialized countries, the 1.4-per-cent gain in July was the largest monthly increase in 34 years, National Bank economist Stéfane Marion said in a research note.</p>
<p>The breakdown by country:</p>
<p>Canada: 97.7 in July, up from 96.4 in June</p>
<p>France: 102.7 in July, up from 101.3 in June</p>
<p>Japan: 94.9 in July, up from 93.5</p>
<p>Germany: 98.5 in July, up from 96.3</p>
<p>Italy: 104.8 in July, up from 102.0</p>
<p>United Kingdom: 100.6 in July, up from 102.0</p>
<p>United States: 96.0 in July, up from 94.4.</p>
<p>Brazil: 97.4 in July, up from 97.2</p>
<p>China: 99.4 in July, up from 98.0</p>
<p>India: 98.6 in July, up from 97.3</p>
<p>Russia: 92.8 in July, up from 91.5</p>
<p>Canadian new home prices: First monthly increase since September, 2008</p>
<p>The prices of new homes in Canada increased by 0.3 per cent in July, following a 0.2 per cent decline in June, Statistics Canada reported Friday. Economists had expected another month-over-month decline.</p>
<p>Between June and July, prices increased the most in Vancouver, up 1.2 per cent, “as consumer interest increased and the new housing market continued to improve,” Statscan said. Prices in Hamilton were up 1.1 per cent and homebuilders in Windsor and Calgary reported price increases of 0.5 per cent.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, prices rose by 0.4 per cent – the first monthly increase since October, 2007. “While some builders recorded lower selling prices in July, many builders returned to regular list prices after having negotiated lower prices in previous months,” Statscan said.</p>
<p>Year-over-year, the new housing price index was down 3.2 per cent.</p>
<p>Still, Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Millan Mulraine found “encouraging signs” in the July report.</p>
<p>“On balance, the message from this report appears to be that the buoyancy that has been seen in the Canadian existing homes market may finally be filtering through to the new homes markets,” Mr. Mulraine said a note to clients.</p>
<p>“In fact, all four Canadian home price measures that we track have now shown monthly gains in prices.”</p>
<p>Global outlook: ‘A recovery, but not a forceful one,' CIBC says</p>
<p>“After sliding into the abyss over the course of 2008 and early 2009, the majority of the world's larger economies are exiting recession or growing again,” Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economists Peter Buchanan and Meny Grauman said in an economic forecast Friday.</p>
<p>“Nine months ago, the U.S. was expected to spearhead the global recovery, as policy makers moved swiftly to counter the worst slump since the 1930s,” they wrote.</p>
<p>“But a jobless and wealth-constrained consumer has dulled recovery prospects there, leaving Asia as the world's principal engine,” the CIBC said in its report.</p>
<p>“Despite better-looking cyclical indicators and an apparent bottoming in global trade, the challenges still facing many developed economies all but ensure that the global economy's momentum over the next two years will fall well short of the pace seen earlier in the decade.”</p>
<p>China: Industrial output at a 12-month high</p>
<p>Industrial output in China grew at a 12-month high of 12.3 per cent in August from a year earlier, outpacing expectations. However, exports fell a steeper-than-expected 23.4 per cent year over year.</p>
<p>“Clearly, it shows that the domestic economy is doing much better because of the [government] stimulus, and external demand is still quite weak,” Tao Wang, an economist with UBS, was quoted as saying in a report by Reuters.</p>
<p>“I don't think weakness in exports is going to derail the face that the general economy will continue to recover,” he said.</p>
<p>The CIBC economists said in their report that the Chinese government implemented the world's biggest stimulus package last fall and, not surprising, China has seen the swiftest turnaround.</p>
<p>The predominantly state-controlled banking system has also shielded the country from the financial turmoil derailing growth elsewhere, the CIBC's Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Grauman wrote.</p>
<p>“That's not to say all is good in the Middle Kingdom. Exports have been pummelled by weakness elsewhere. Investments from non-state companies have trailed explosive growth in infrastructure spending, and confidence also remains fragile,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Japan: Recovery still fragile, swine flu poses a risk, economist says</p>
<p>Japan's cabinet office reported Friday that the country's gross national product grew at an annualized pace of 2.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2009 following a year-long contraction. On a quarterly basis, the gain was 0.6 per cent from the first three months of the year, lower than the 0.9 per cent that economists had predicted.</p>
<p>Economists said the recovery remains fragile and is primarily due to strong exports to China and other emerging countries for products such a video recorders and other electronics. Within Japan, consumer demand remains weak.</p>
<p>“Risk factors remain for the winter months, including the possibility that consumer spending will fall because of the flu,” Tasuo Yamamoto, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute said.</p>
<p>“On the surface, the incoming Democratic Party's pledge to kick-start a still fragile consumer sector sounds encouraging,” the CIBC economists said in their report. “About 60 per cent of Japan's exports go to other parts of Asia and improving trade flows, coupled with a turn in the inventory cycle, should lend support to the economy in the second quarter of the year.”</p>
<p>Brazil: Latin America's largest economy emerges from recession</p>
<p>Strong domestic consumption boosted Brazil's gross domestic product to a 1.9 per cent increase in the second quarter from the previous quarter, government officials said Frisday.</p>
<p>The positive result came after the government lavished tax breaks on individuals and businesses with an economic stimulus package, economists said.</p>
<p>The administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva also poured money into public works projects to counter the global slowdown and slashed taxes on new car purchases, prompting an extended buying spree.</p>
<p>The second-quarter growth figure was at the high end of expectations from analysts surveyed by the private Agencia Estado news agency. Analysts have predicted Brazil will have overall flat or negative growth for all of 2009. The government predicts the economy will expand more than 4 per cent next year.</p>
<p>United States: Consumer confidence edges up, but back-to-school spending down</p>
<p>U.S. consumer sentiment rose in early September to the strongest level since June, according to the Reuters/University of Michigan surveys of consumers. The preliminary index of sentiment for September rose to 70.2, the highest since June, from 65.7 in August, Reuters reported Friday. This was above economists' median expectation of a reading of 67.3, according to a Reuters poll.</p>
<p>“Confidence rebounded in early September as consumers increasingly expected the economy to improve despite their reluctant conclusion that their own financial situation would remain quite problematic for some time,” the Reuters/University of Michigan Surveys of Consumers said in a statement.</p>
<p>Still, North American consumers “are not, at the moment, leading the march to economic recovery,” analysts Keith Howlett and Chase Bethel of Desjardins Securities said in a research note, citing weak back-to-school spending.</p>
<p>“Back to school sales trends are frequently a harbinger of how sales will be for the balance of the year,” the Desjardin analysts wrote. “In that context, consumers appear financially stressed, as reflected in the weak July and August sales results of both U.S. and Canadian retailers.”</p>
<p>In Canada: Bankruptcies down 5.4 per cent month over month</p>
<p>“Insolvency data released this morning by the Office of the Superintendent of Bankruptcy Canada provides further evidence that the worst of the economic downturn may have passed,” retail analyst Keith Howlett of Desjardins Securities said in a research note. “Although consumer bankruptcies filed in July were 38.1 per cent higher than they were in July, 2008, filings were down 4.9 per cent compared with June, 2009,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“This marks the first instance of a sequential improvement in consumer bankruptcy filings since December, 2008,” Mr. Howlett noted.</p>
<p>Business bankruptcies were down 16.1 per cent month over month and 5.3 per cent year over year, the bankruptcy superintendent reported.</p>
<p>Mr. Howlett noted that the Canadian labour market appears to be stabilizing, with the economy adding 27,100 jobs in August.</p>
<p>“If sustained, these trends will translate into improved consumer confidence and higher spending,” Mr. Howlett said.</p>

</div><div>ROD MICKLEBURGH </div>
<div>766 words</div><div>11 September 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>S3</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

 </div>
</p>
<p>rmickleburgh@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Marie (“Let them eat cake”) Antoinette, rest easy. You have company. Step forward, Education Minister Margaret MacDiarmid.</p>
<p>What was Dr. MacDiarmid thinking? Was she thinking at all, when the respected family physician and ex-president of the B.C. Medical Association responded to the growing outcry over cutbacks to school sports programs with a suggestion that students might compensate by “walking or dancing or playing in parks”?</p>
<p>Yes, nothing like a bunch of high-school rugby players keeping fit by dancing around a larch or playing rumple-my-stiltskin in the nearest park.</p>
<p>Among those outraged by the rookie minister's seemingly callous remark was none other than Elaine Tanner. Yes, that Elaine Tanner, the dynamic Mighty Mouse of the pool who won a record three swimming medals for Canada at the 1968 Olympics.</p>
<p>Ms. Tanner e-mailed me out of the blue. “WOW!” she wrote of Dr. MacDiarmid's prancing-in-the-parks idea. “I can't wait to see what type of world-class athletes that will create for Canada.”</p>
<p>The former swim champ, whose gripping personal story is well recounted on her website elainetanner.ca, called it “the most troubling comment I have heard from someone in a position of leadership in this province, when it comes to sport and competition issues.”</p>
<p>She pointed out that spending on sports helps combat youth involvement in crime and drugs, while promoting healthy living. “[These cutbacks] will end up costing us 10 times more in the long run.”</p>
<p>Bruce Allen, rock promoter and CKNW radio ranter, was more blunt. “Is she on acid?” he wondered of Minister MacDiarmid on the wireless yesterday.</p>
<p>Olympic peevishness</p>
<p>Incidentally, it's no wonder that the provincial Liberals and Premier Gordon Campbell, in particular, are plummeting in public opinion. People don't like to be played for suckers, as they feel they were during the spring election campaign, when the Libs said nothing about the province's deteriorating financial situation or about harmonizing the sales tax.</p>
<p>Nor is the public mood improved by all those government cuts to such worthy institutions as the arts, community groups, school sports and even parent advisory councils.</p>
<p>There are signs this souring is spreading to the 2010 Winter Olympics. Over the years, Mr. Campbell has been front and centre at virtually every high-profile 2010 event. But now, the more people see an increasingly unpopular Premier whooping it up over the Olympics at a time of recession and cutbacks, the more they transfer their crankiness to the Games themselves.</p>
<p>Rare is the criticism of slashed government funding that doesn't link it to the oodles of bucks being spent on the Olympics, however tenuous the connection.</p>
<p>A recent Ipsos-Reid poll asked 440 Vancouverites whether they thought the Olympics is a “colossal waste of money that will render Vancouver in debt for years to come.” Sixty-four per cent said yes. Even more (72 per cent) agreed that the Games are “an expensive luxury, given the economic shape the world is in.”</p>
<p>It's true that 64 per cent of the same respondents also said they supported the 2010 Winter Olympics, but hey, that's what polls are for.</p>
<p>Meantime, we have the anti-Olympic peevishness of B.C. Teachers' Federation president Irene Lanzinger, who slammed a harmless Olympic school program by saying kids should be told, too, about drug testing, Olympic corruption and corporate sponsorship of the Games. Wouldn't want to actually inspire any youngsters, would we?</p>
<p>The good old days</p>
<p>The news flash came right out of the twilight zone, or perhaps from a Star Trek time warp that had Capt. Kirk managing the Montreal Expos. Breathlessly billed as “CKNW Breaking News,” it buzzed its way directly into my computer: “Prime Minister Mulroney has appointed B.C. Court of Appeal Justice Robert Bauman as the new Chief Justice of the B.C. Supreme Court.”</p>
<p>Hurray, I thought. The 1980s were back. A simpler, more pleasant time. The Steamer captained the Canucks, young people still read newspapers, vinyl was king, Stephen Harper was just a guy named Steve on the ballot, and I'd never heard of mutual funds.</p>
<p>Alas, the idyll was short-lived. It was soon déjà vu, all over again.</p>
<p>Within a mere six minutes came the inevitable “Breaking News correction”: “Prime Minister Harper has appointed…” Ah well, back to the 21st century, the horrors of swine flu and Twitter.</p>

<p>* President Obama delivered a speech to America's schoolchildren on the first day of school, and he encouraged them to work hard and study hard. Then he said, "if that doesn't work, grab a seat next to the Asian kid."</p>
<p>* Then he told them, "Be careful what you post on Facebook." Obama then told them about bad things that could happen, like the time he accidentally "friended" Joe Biden.</p>
<p>* Obama said if he could have dinner with anyone in history he would pick Gandhi. He says he picked Gandhi so he'd get to eat two entrees.</p>
<p>* Yesterday at a press conference, George Clooney was answering questions when one reporter took off his clothes and professed his love to Clooney. Witnesses say they've never been more embarrassed for Wolf Blitzer.</p>
<p>David Letterman</p>
<p>Top 10 surprises in president Barack Obama's message to students</p>
<p>10. Advised struggling students to, "Give up and play video games all day"</p>
<p>9. Midway through the address he lit up a smoke</p>
<p>8. Spent most of speech yakking about new season of Gossip Girl</p>
<p>7. Urged kids to put their allowance on Packers this weekend</p>
<p>6. Boosted approval rating by promising every kid a kitty</p>
<p>5. Kept shouting, "Swine flu! Run!"</p>
<p>4. Told kids to listen to their parents, "Except for the eight of you stuck with Jon and Kate"</p>
<p>3. Concluded remarks by saying, "Have fun being unemployed when you graduate!"</p>
<p>2. Tip for success? Cheat off Asian kids</p>
<p>1. Told students to "work hard and study, or you'll end up like president Bush"</p>
<p>Craig Ferguson</p>
<p>* When kids went back to school yesterday, they got a surprise: President Obama gave a speech just for them. As predicted, a lot of people are throwing a hissy fit over his speech. One Republican said Obama was using the speech to push his socialist agenda. Yeah . . . and I suppose telling kids not to do drugs is pushing his health-care reform.</p>
<p>Tonight's TV</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospital addition won't add beds; $222M project at Lougheed hit by health budget crunch</b>
</div><div>Michelle Lang   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>841 words</div><div>11 September 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>A major $222-million expansion of Peter Lougheed Hospital will not add any new beds to the Calgary medical system when it opens later this month because of budgetary constraints at Alberta's medical superboard, health officials confirmed this week.</p>
<p>Originally billed as a 140-bed expansion of the northeast hospital, Alberta Health Services now says existing units will be relocated into the new east wing--and the doors to the old wards will be closed.</p>
<p>Medical staff said Thursday they are disappointed the addition won't add any capacity to the medical system, but superboard officials said there is no cash to open more beds as the organization faces a $1.1-billion budget deficit.</p>
<p>"They're moving over and basically providing the same service, so there's no net gain," Sue Gudmundson, vice-president of Peter Lougheed Centre, said in an interview.</p>
<p>"As additional funding and staff become available, we could entertain opening the beds, but that process hasn't happened yet."</p>
<p>United Nurses of Alberta representatives said the new wing was intended to ease the bed crunch when it was announced four years ago.</p>
<p>"Even though we will have all these units with the ability to have people in them, we'll be putting patients in closets again," said Diane Lantz, president of the union's local at Peter Lougheed Centre.</p>
<p>News that the Peter Lougheed project won't add any beds to the facility comes about one year after construction was completed on a 100-bed expansion at Calgary's Rockyview Hospital where health officials also had to close several old units as they opened the project. As a result, no new beds were added during the Rockyview addition.</p>
<p>The Alberta Liberals said the multimillion-dollar construction projects have been a waste of taxpayer's dollars, arguing government and the superboard should have planned to increase the operating budget to take advantage of the new spaces.</p>
<p>"I think many Albertans are just tearing their hair out at the way government spends money without results," said Dr. David Swann, the Alberta Liberal leader.</p>
<p>"This is building a part of a hospital and (having no money) to staff it. It's really disappointing."</p>
<p>Alberta Health officials did not return phone calls late Thursday.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, a leaked Alberta Health Services memo suggested the province would have to significantly boost the superboard's operating funding to open the Peter Lougheed expansion without mothballing old wards.</p>
<p>The memo said the superboard, which is currently looking to trim budgets in the face of a massive deficit, would need an additional $48 million to $50 million to increase capacity by 140 beds, operating both the new wing and existing units.</p>
<p>"The East Wing was built with no commitment for operational funding," said the memo.</p>
<p>The new east wing at Peter Lougheed will open in stages, beginning Sept. 22, with the move wrapping up by late November.</p>
<p>Health officials say three medical units and one surgical ward will relocate to the new wing, as well as the hospital's intensive-care unit.</p>
<p>The hospital's cardiology ward is also set to move into the addition and Alberta Health Services said a separate coronary-care unit--which offers close monitoring for patients with conditions such as heart failure--will open.</p>
<p>Cardiologists applauded the decision to go ahead with a six-bed coronary-care unit, noting the superboard's budget constraints had left the opening of the unit uncertain.</p>
<p>"It's good news," said Dr. Hamid Banijamali, the hospital's site leader for cardiology. "It's what we requested. We can't work with substandard tools."</p>
<p>While the new wing won't add more beds, Alberta Health Services said the new area will be a better environment for patients and staff.</p>
<p>Gudmundson said the addition has better infection control, including single-patient rooms and, in most cases, a private bathroom for patients.</p>
<p>The wing also offers more options for housing patients, she said, noting single rooms can be converted into double rooms. If the H1N1 influenza sickened large numbers of people, for example, this could help take additional patients.</p>
<p>"It gives us a new level of flexibility," said Gudmundson.</p>
<p>She also said the new wing could allow Alberta Health Services to open additional beds in the future.</p>
<p>The Calgary and Area Physicians Association said the new beds are needed now to help address emergency room waits and overcrowding.</p>
<p>"This is really hard on staff morale and it's not good for patient care," said Dr. Linda Slocombe. "We needed the beds."</p>

older wards will close.

<p>Lower jet-fuel prices and tighter operating costs helped Montreal-based vacation travel giant <span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>. post third-quarter earnings of $31 million, or 94 cents a share, a big swing from a net loss of $900,000, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier.</p>
<p>But the latest quarter ended July 31 included a special non-cash gain of $44.4 million on fuel-hedging contracts, compared with a loss of $4.7 million a year earlier. Excluding the special gain, Transat earned 21 cents a share in the latest quarter.</p>
<p>Revenue was $819 million, down 4.7 per cent from $860 million a year earlier. Revenue from the North American units was lower, but the European units improved their performance. Overall margins improved.</p>
<p>CEO Jean-Marc Eustache said the tourism market is proving relatively resilient and the latest quarter's results were satisfactory considering the overhang of supply, the impact of the global recession and the swine flu menace.</p>
<p>Transat raised its provision for its asset-backed commercial paper holdings by $6.9 million to a total of $64.3 million.</p>

</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt from an editorial in the Hamilton Spectator on Sept. 9.</p>
<p>Whether it becomes the worst-case scenario with a pandemic-scope outbreak this fall, or ends up being less severe, H1N1 is proving to be a dramatic test for everyone from Canada's public health regulatory regime to health departments, schools, doctors and the media.</p>
<p>And there is no shortage of experts predicting one extreme outcome or the other. The World Health Organization warns of an explosion in cases that could double every three to four days for several months, causing the death toll to rise much higher than the 72 fatalities recorded so far in this country. But equally credible experts say H1N1 won't be anywhere near that severe, this time at least, and current public health resources and available vaccine should be able to handle it with relative ease. In Australia, flu season is already underway, and authorities report it's not much worse than a typical year.</p>
<p>The reality is no one knows for certain what we're facing, but we'll probably find out soon, since classrooms provide the ideal environment for the virus to spread. . . .</p>
<p>Whether this ends with the worst case, best case or some scenario in between, there will be much to learn from how we react to and deal with the H1N1 threat. It may be the first pandemic of our time, but it won't be the last, so that learning, and how we apply it, is critical.</p>

</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>

</p>
<p>WHERE have all the university students suddenly come from?</p>
<p>Both University of Manitoba and University of Winnipeg have growing enrolments, though both had hoped to have stable enrolments at best and even feared they would lose students.</p>
<p>Preliminary figures at U of M show 4.3 per cent more students than at this time last year, pushing enrolment over the 27,000-mark to 27,262.</p>
<p>New students in University-1 are up by 6.4 per cent, graduate students are up 5.5 per cent, and international students 0.8 per cent. However, they are not all full-time, nor do they all carry a maximum course load: the growth in credit hours -- the number of courses each student actually takes and on which he or she pays fees -- has grown 2.8 per cent. At U of W, deputy provost and associate vice-president international Neil Besner said credit hours are up 0.6 per cent.</p>
<p>"We're up in first-year students, but that is mitigated by a drop in returning students," Besner said. First-year students are up three per cent, but returning students are down: "Our best guess is we're flat" in actual students. "We must focus more on retention this year."</p>
<p>U of M president David Barnard said the university is analyzing where all these students have come from.</p>
<p>"We tried to budget conservatively," he said, but educators know that in tough economic times, young people who'd otherwise join the workforce tend to go back to school.</p>
<p>Other provinces are also seeing increases, Barnard said.</p>
<p>The Brandon Sun has reported BU's enrolment is down five per cent, worse than the school's forecast of a three per cent drop. While student numbers are significant, university budgets are driven by credit hours.</p>
<p>Besner said U of W is particularly happy to be holding its own with international students, despite fears of the H1N1 virus, especially in the Korean media.</p>
<p>There are 30 new students from Germany, he pointed out.</p>
<p>University officials emphasized all their numbers are very preliminary, and it will be several weeks before enrolment numbers are firm.</p>

<p>Jean-Marc Eustache, Transat chief executive, right, also set the lofty goal of returning his company to its highest point of profitability within the next two years.</p>
<p>His comments mark a dramatic shift in strategy for Transat, which has spent the past few years locked in a price war after Sunwing Vacations made an aggressive push into the packaged-tour business. Until now, Transat has leveraged its larger size to match any capacity increases with its own, dragging down prices, profits and some of its competitors -- such as <span class="companylink">Conquest Vacations</span>, which folded last year --along the way.</p>
<p>But Transat's earnings have suffered, and Mr. Eustache said he planned to reverse those fortunes.</p>
<p>"We don't have good profitability, and we're not satisfied with the results of Transat for the past three years," he said on a conference call. "This year we will look at the market and the capacity and if we see that something is slowing, right away we will cut capacity."</p>
<p>While the Street met his promises to cede certain markets with some skepticism, David Newman, National Bank Financial analyst, noted the tour operator is on better footing this year with lower fuel and hotel costs, its new leasing contract with <span class="companylink">CanJet Airlines</span>, and the recent restructuring of its operations.</p>
<p>But he expects the packaged-tour market to remain competitive this year with up to 10% more capacity expected to be added after WestJet Vacations and Air Canada Vacations announced they would be bolstering their networks down south this winter.</p>
<p>Mr. Eustache said he expects the bulk of that added capacity to be directed to such places as Hawaii, Las Vegas and Florida, which are not Transat's primary markets. In places such as Cuba, Mexico and Dominican Republic, where it competes aggressively, capacity is expected to be flat this winter, he said. He did, however, say that prices were down by about 2% and that it is too early to judge the full impact the economy and H1N1 will have this winter.</p>
<p>The news came as Transat reported a better-than-expected third-quarter result with adjusted earnings of $7-million, or 21¢ a share, excluding certain one-time items. That was ahead of the 6¢ a share it earned last year, and the Street's expectations of 14¢ a share, buoyed by its CanJet contract and lower fuel costs.</p>
<p>Investors reacted favour-ably, driving the stock up more than 10% to close at $14.09 a share on the Toronto Stock Exchange yesterday.</p>
<p>Cameron Doerksen, Versant Partners analyst, said he was encouraged by the results, but remains cautious about the competitive landscape this winter. He maintained his "neutral" rating on the stock and his $17 price target, but encouraged investors to buy on any weakness, with $13 a share a good entry point.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Transat announced a share offering yesterday aimed at raising up to $63.5-million to be used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and possible future acquisitions.</p>
<p>The company said it would issue 4,250,000 common and variable voting shares, with an over-allotment option of 637,000 shares, at $13 each in a bought-deal to the syndicate led by <span class="companylink">National Bank Financial Inc</span>. The offer, which is expected to expire on Sept. 30, represents a near 7% premium on where the shares closed yesterday.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Indian control over health care emerging issue</b>

</p>
<p>There is a new movement emerging in Indian Country -- control of medical services. This is the message coming from the medicine chest task force.</p>
<p>"Medicine chest" refers to the clause in the treaties that states: "A chest of medicines will be kept for each reserve." This clause was inserted after our ancestors realized they were vulnerable to the diseases and epidemics that were sweeping the country.</p>
<p>The result has been that today most reserves have medical clinics, and our people have access to uninsured health benefits such as optometric care and dental care that includes extractions and fillings and other specialized services.</p>
<p>With the H1N1 flu bearing down on Indian Country, this policy is making a lot of sense. This fall the buzz is that the H1N1 flu will become highly active and the most vulnerable will be those who live in poverty and cramped conditions. Our people fill this description, and we can expect that H1N1 will have a serious effect on our people.</p>
<p>The 1970s' policy of "Indian control of Indian education" led to the establishment of reserve schools and our educational institutions. The Medicine Chest Task force is headed in the same direction.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Good for Phil Fontaine, for whom there is life after politics. Former national and provincial Indian leaders have faded into obscurity or retired back on the rez. Retirement from Indian politics usually means abject poverty, with few prospects.</p>
<p>But Fontaine has used his experience and good name to launch a career in business. This is a break from tradition and more in keeping with the practice of federal and provincial politicians, who use their name and influence to sit on boards of directors and to get short-term contracts.</p>
<p>So far, Fontaine has become an adviser to the <span class="companylink">Royal Bank of Canada</span> and a member of the board of <span class="companylink">Avalon Rare Metals Inc</span>. His work with the Royal Bank will be on general First Nations issues, and his first assignment centres on the Olympics -- the torch relay in particular.</p>
<p>Avalon is a mineral exploration and development company that specializes in rare earths and has ownership of a large deposit at Thor Lake in the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>Businesses are starting to see the value of having experienced Indian leaders on their boards of directors or as advisers. These leaders bring a wealth of experience to the table and are a definite asset. I'm sure we'll hear more about Fontaine in the future as he continues on a career in business.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Boy, they sure taught him a lesson. I'm sure Colin Thatcher is really broken up because he won't be allowed to collect the royalties on his book.</p>
<p>As someone who has published two books, I know that the profits from book sales are less than spectacular. Even if Thatcher's book proves to be a bestseller, he still will be out only about $10,000 to $15,000, which is chump change in his world.</p>
<p>As far as I'm concerned, Thatcher should have been kept behind bars. He has refused to admit his guilt or to show remorse. Donald Marshall and David Milgaard had to prove their innocence before they were released. They remained in jail as long as they refused to admit they were guilty.</p>
<p>In Thatcher's case, he was found as guilty as Cain in a highly publicized trial. According to him, he was framed by a conspiracy that included the entire Saskatchewan justice system.</p>
<p>Thatcher made a good point though: The justice system is flawed. The fact that he was released on parole proves it.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Now they are doing it Down Under. The Australian government recently acknowledged "the abuse and neglect suffered by many children in institutional or other out-of-home care during the last century was unacceptable."</p>
<p>Does this sound familiar? The government of Canada apologized for the Indian boarding schools, dealing mainly with the physical, mental and cultural abuse. In Australia they have taken it further.</p>
<p>In Canada we suffered from the Big Scoop, where social agencies gathered up children and sent them to foster homes. Today we have people in the United States, Europe and other countries who were scooped up and sent away.</p>
<p>These people need to be repatriated, and an apology is in order. The apology should be addressed to all aboriginal people in Canada because this policy reflects its institutionalized racism.</p>
<p>Canadians like to consider themselves morally superior to most other people on the planet, especially the Americans. In reality, we have institutionalized racism and have done serious damage to our First Nations people.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>One West Nile case reported; Main risk period for contracting virus in Sask. is over</b>
</div><div>Barb Pacholik   </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Regina Leader-Post</div>
<div>407 words</div><div>11 September 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The season for the West Nile virus has come and nearly gone with little impact after Saskatchewan saw its first human case of the mosquito-borne illness in the dwindling days of summer.</p>
<p>"It's certainly good not to have to deal with two major outbreak issues at once," Dr. Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer, told reporters Thursday, referring to the ongoing preparations for a potential H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>A mild case of West Nile virus was recently confirmed in the Sun Country Health Region, located in the province's southeast corner. An adult male is recovering after contracting the virus in early August. He was diagnosed when he sought medical attention.</p>
<p>Mild West Nile symptoms include joint aches and pains, mild fever and headaches.</p>
<p>While the main risk period is past, McKinnon said a few more West Nile cases will likely surface because of a delay between infection and detection.</p>
<p>Entomologist Phil Curry, the province's West Nile co-ordinator, said this year's low numbers are mainly due to cooler temperatures. The highest risk period is typically the last two weeks of July and first two weeks of August.</p>
<p>"Even in a low-activity year, we can still get a few human cases," he added.</p>
<p>Culex tarsalis mosquitoes, which carry the disease, usually peak around mid-August, then go into hibernation. A different variety of mosquitoes is currently out.</p>
<p>"They're annoying. They're a nuisance, but they're not carrying West Nile virus," said Curry.</p>
<p>But he cautioned that while the West Nile risk is declining, it still exists.</p>
<p>"As long as we are continuing to get this warm weather and warm nights, there are lots of mosquitoes out there biting. A few of them could be Culex tarsalis. . . . It will not be totally zero until we get a few hard frosts."</p>
<p>Last year's 17 human West Nile cases -- mostly mild and none fatal -- also meant a low year. The worst outbreaks in Saskatchewan were in 2003, with 947 cases, and 2007 at 1,456.</p>
<p>People are still encouraged to wear insect repellent containing DEET, wear protective clothing, reduce time outdoors at dawn and dusk and reduce mosquito habitat.</p>
<p>In its worst form, the West Nile virus can result in paralysis and death.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Scouts, Guides bouncing back; Clubs reinventing themselves for a new generation of young people</b>
</div><div>Shannon Proudfoot </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>488 words</div><div>10 September 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>C3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>A new season of Scouts and Girl Guides is kicking off, and both century-old organizations are reinventing themselves in an effort to buoy flagging memberships and show they're relevant to a generation more worried about cyberbullying than charred marshmallows.</p>
<p>The Girl Guides of Canada has introduced a body-image badge and launched a new ad campaign, while Scouts Canada is discarding its iconic tan uniforms and teaching disaster preparedness for H1N1.</p>
<p>In the U.S. this week, the Department of Homeland Security launched a program to award the country's 3.4 million Girl Scouts (the equivalent of Girl Guides) with special badges for completing disaster-preparedness training.</p>
<p>"People see us as all about cookies, and we are so much more," says Linda Crawford, director of operations for Girl Guides of Canada. "It provides [girls] with leadership opportunities, and it's in a very safe, non-threatening, all-female environment."</p>
<p>The organization is kicking off its 100th anniversary celebration in January, and has just launched a new advertising campaign that positions guides as the antidote to the hyper-sexed, pressurized landscape in which modern girls live.</p>
<p>The heyday for the Girl Guides of Canada was the 1980s, with a membership of about 200,000. It is now down to about 90,000.</p>
<p>Scouts Canada membership peaked at around 320,000 in Canada in the 1960s, says Steve Kent, chief commissioner, and that has fallen to about 96,000 in recent years. Efforts to reinvent scouting appear to be paying off, however, because membership has floated back up to about 100,000, about 20 per cent of whom are female.</p>
<p>"The Scouts Canada of today is not your father's or your grandfather's Boy Scouts," he says. "I think because of our history, people have an antiquated view of scouting."</p>
<p>For starters, they aren't called the Boy Scouts any longer, having been co-ed for more than a decade, he says, but many people still don't know that.</p>
<p>The "be prepared" motto has morphed into disaster-preparedness training for scouts of all ages, Kent says, which is particularly relevant amid today's pandemic fears and natural disasters.</p>
<p>Scouts Canada and Girl Guides say they now get their young members more involved in shaping their programs and policies, and in both cases this resulted in a loosening of uniform requirements. The Scouts have added a "leisure" outfit of a T-shirt and neckerchief in addition to their traditional tan uniforms, and Girl Guides have modernized their dress code.</p>
<p>"Society has changed and organizations with lengthy histories like ours have been challenged to keep up," Kent says. "We need to really reintroduce ourselves to the Canadian public."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Company confident in H1N1 vaccine</b>
</div><div>Marianne White </div>

</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical company producing the H1N1 pandemic flu vaccine for Canadians is awaiting results of ongoing clinical trials, but <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> said Wednesday it is confident the vaccine will live up to expectations.</p>
<p>"We have pretty good indication as to whether or not the vaccine will work. We've made a related vaccine before for the H5N1 (avian flu) pandemic so we're pretty certain the vaccine will work," said Paul Lucas, president and CEO of <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>.</p>
<p>"Clinical trials are going on right now and the results of those will become available shortly," added Lucas, at the company's flu vaccine plant near Quebec City.</p>
<p>The company has said it will test its vaccine with more than 9,000 people in Canada, the United States and Europe taking part in 16 clinical trials.</p>
<p>The results of these trials will determine how many doses of vaccine are needed and how potent to make them.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50 million doses from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> , with the entire order to be produced at the Quebec factory.</p>
<p>The federal and provincial government announced Wednesday the pharmaceutical company will receive $60 million in public money to increase its capacity to bottle the vaccine at the Quebec plant -- the only flu vaccine production facility in Canada. The company will invest $30 million.</p>
<p>Currently, the facility can produce more vaccine that it can bottle in a timely manner. In order to put the H1N1 vaccine in vials, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> will have to export vaccine in bulk to be filled outside of Canada and then brought back here.</p>
<p>The Canadian government felt this could create security risks and asked the company to upgrade its facility to ensure the full production and filling of pandemic vaccine capacity domestically.</p>

</p>
<p>More cases of the H1N1 flu are expected at schools this fall, says Vancouver Coastal Health's chief medical officer, Dr. Patricia Daly.</p>
<p>That prediction comes after a student at St. George's private school in Vancouver tested positive for the H1N1 flu, forcing boarding students to be sent home.</p>
<p>Daly said with school starting this week they are bracing for more cases to be reported to health authorities.</p>
<p>But she said it should not be alarming for most, unless they have underlying health problems.</p>
<p>"H1N1 is an aggressive strain and it will circulate," she said.</p>
<p>"If students do get the flu symptoms, keep them home."</p>
<p>She advised people to wash their hands often and when they cough do it into a shirt sleeve, not their hands.</p>
<p>H1N1 has been circulating in low volumes throughout B.C. since the spring.</p>
<p>Since spring there have been more than 22 cases of people getting H1N1 and there have been four deaths attributed to the flu.</p>
<p>Daly said they are hoping for a vaccine for H1N1 by mid-November and she recommends everyone get one.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Butterflies to mark 100 years for nurses; Alberta centennial for Victorian Order of Nurses</b>
</div><div>Alex Frazer-Harrison </div>
<div>For Neighbours</div>
<div>1181 words</div><div>10 September 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>N5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald </div>
</p>
<p>The same year Amelia Davidson was born in a sod house in the Alberta town of Torrington, the Victorian Order of Nurses opened its first branch in the province.</p>
<p>Today, the 100-year-old woman stays mobile and healthy partly due to the efforts of one of the order's nurses, who visits her regularly to provide footcare.</p>
<p>To mark the Alberta centennial of the Victorian Order of Nurses (VON), a memorial butterfly release is slated for Saturday, Sept. 12.</p>
<p>For $35, participants can "purchase" or sponsor a butterfly in honour or memory of a loved one.</p>
<p>Direct donations can also be made, with the money helping to support plans to establish a footcare program at the Calgary Drop-In Centre.</p>
<p>When asked her secret for remaining spry, Davidson chuckles.</p>
<p>"I wasn't born that way," she says.</p>
<p>"I was sick a lot. I couldn't even go to school 'til I was almost out of my teens. I had liver problems, so the teacher wouldn't let me come to school as long as my skin was yellow. I studied at home."</p>
<p>Davidson says her family, who moved to the Torrington area, were joined by families who had left Romania.</p>
<p>"About 20 families settled there because war was breaking out" in Romania, she says.</p>
<p>"They had to get out or go to war with the rest. There was nothing here to start with--nothing."</p>
<p>It was in part to address the medical needs of this influx of immigrants to Alberta that Lady Lougheed, grandmother of former premier Peter Lougheed, and several other local women founded the Calgary branch of VON in 1909.</p>
<p>Created to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Victoria's rule of the British Empire, the non-profit charitable organization was founded in Ottawa in 1897, initially due to concern over lack of medical care to Canadian families in remote areas.</p>
<p>The Calgary branch initially provided care to those who couldn't afford to pay for it themselves.</p>
<p>For its first eight years in Calgary, a single nurse served the entire city, getting to her clients by bike and streetcar.</p>
<p>Today, more than 200 nurses and health care workers help deliver the order's Calgary's services, says board chairperson Barb Wilkinson.</p>
<p>"Our service is about community work," she says -- adding it works with clients of all ages, but many seniors benefit from the organization's footcare, travel clinic and immunization programs.</p>
<p>"In our footcare program, our nurses are specially trained and are recognized across Canada," says Wilkinson. "Veterans Affairs Canada recognizes our program, Health Canada does, and we've been involved in aboriginal research studies in footcare and diabetes."</p>
<p>Susanne Thygesen visits Davidson at home every few months to provide footcare.</p>
<p>Originally in general practice, Thygesen joined VON four years ago and says it's been her lifelong dream to work with the order.</p>
<p>"I grew up in this city and I remember seeing VON nurses visiting neighbours, and it's something I always had in the back of my mind that I'd like to work with them," she says.</p>
<p>Thygesen works with a couple of hundred clients, providing footcare services at Bethany Calgary, Bethany Cochrane and the Alex Community Health Centre, as well as doing home visits with people like Davidson.</p>
<p>"I get to meet some of the nicest people you could imagine," she says. "I have my little adventures once in awhile as well."</p>
<p>She has to be flexible, working with everyone from clients who are in good shape to those who have dementia.</p>
<p>Footcare is not about doing pedicures and esthetics, says Thygesen. For older clients, it's often a matter of helping them maintain mobility and independence.</p>
<p>"A lot of them can't bend forward anymore -- or if they did, they'd fall down," she says.</p>
<p>"Or if you have a bit of a tummy, you can't breathe and your vision goes, and there's strength in the hand involved as well. They need a little help and that's where we come in."</p>
<p>One of Davidson's four daughters, Ruby Sykes, says she appreciates the fact VON can do home visits so that her mom doesn't have to travel.</p>
<p>"One of the biggest things is Susanne comes to the house -- that's a big plus -- and caring for (my mother's) feet so she can still walk," says Sykes. "She doesn't have to use a cane or a walker as long as her feet are in good shape and her hips are good."</p>
<p>The visits provide a bit of respite for Sykes and Wilkinson says VON Calgary also provides adult day programs in some centres for this reason.</p>
<p>"The programs give the caregivers a break and the client some socialization and things to do," says Wilkinson.</p>
<p>The organization also provides post-surgery home services.</p>
<p>Another important program offered by the order is flu and travel immunization. Wilkinson predicts nurses will be kept busy working this fall providing the H1N1 flu vaccine.</p>
<p>VON Calgary offers a mix of client-pay and fundraising-supported services. Many programs -- such as footcare services at local women's shelters, such as the YWCA Sheriff King Home and Mary Dover House -- are supported by donations, says Wilkinson.</p>
<p>A memorial release of butterflies was chosen because "the butterflies are a symbol of our past and of moving forward into the next century," she says.</p>
<p>"We hope to sell 500 butterflies. We might do this on an annual basis."</p>
<p>Wilkinson also hopes the event, and the centennial, help raise awareness of the order's services in Calgary, as well as that of the other Alberta branches in Edmonton and Medicine Hat.</p>
<p>VON is also on the lookout for volunteers to help with home visits, and assisting nurses and health care workers -- and if any nurses or health care workers are looking for a new career option, the order would like to hear from you, says Wilkinson.</p>
<p>Davidson says she enjoys her VON nurse's periodic visits: "It's just having fellowship with one another."</p>
<p>The memorial live butterfly release celebration is scheduled from noon to 3 p. m. Saturday -- with the release at 1 p. m. -- at the Dalhousie Community Centre at 5432 Dalhart Rd., N. W.</p>

</p>
<p>Globe and Mail writer Caroline Alphonso hosted a live discussion on Friday, Sept. 11 at 11 a.m. ET with Dr. Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research Chair in Public Health Policy at the University of Ottawa and Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. What follows is a transcript.</p>
<p>10:58 Globe and Mail: Hi everyone -- Dr. Wilson will be here soon to take your questions. Feel free to post them and he will get to them as soon as he can.</p>
<p>11:00 Caroline Alphonso: Good morning everyone. I’m Caroline Alphonso, a reporter with The Globe and Mail, and I'm pleased to have Dr. Kumanan Wilson on-line with us today. Dr. Wilson is the Canada Research Chair in Public Health Policy at the University of Ottawa and the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. Welcome Dr. Wilson.</p>
<p>11:01 Kumanan: Hi and thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>11:01 Caroline Alphonso: To start off with, there’s been some reluctance on the part of Canadians to get vaccinated. Why do you think that is so, and what should public health authorities do?</p>
<p>11:04 Kumanan: I think the publics attitude to getting the flu vaccine is somewhat of a moving target and I suspect will be largely influenced by their perception of how serious the outbreak is going to be. With the standard influenza vaccine one of the challenges in getting young healthy people to get the vaccine is that they don't feel its neccessary. With this virus, though, this population may be at particular risk.</p>
<p>I think public health officials need to communicate the need for the vaccine - bu thtey have to be careful to do so in a way that doesn't look like they are forcing it on people. They also need to communicate all of the mechanisms they are instituting to ensure that the vaccine is both safe and effective.</p>
<p>11:05 Caroline Alphonso: Thanks, Dr. Wilson. We had quite a few reader comments overnight. So why don't we start with a couple of those questions.</p>
<p>Here's one:</p>
<p>Hello, my 17-year-old daughter has a history of asthma and pneumonia. She takes an inhaled steroid daily to control her symptoms. She also has severe egg allergy, so she will be unable to receive any type of flu vaccine available in Canada. I understand from following the media that Novartis, the U.S. supplier, has a limited quantity of vaccine not incubated in eggs. Is any of this vaccine going to be available in Canada to egg-allergic individuals and, if not, what strategy should we follow to deal with the H1N1 virus? I am worried and feeling rather helpless.</p>
<p>11:07 Kumanan: My understanding is that at present all of Canada’s vaccine is to be egg based. Canadian researchers are beginning to look it the question of whether our assumption that people with egg allergies should not receive the flu vaccine is correct. I am not sure whether the results of these studies will be available prior to the vaccine campaign. Unfortunately, there are segments of the population that will either not be able to receive the vaccine or will not develop sufficient immunity to the vaccine. This is why it is particularly important that we have a high rate of vaccine coverage so that these individuals can be protected by herd immunity (when enough of the population is effectively vaccinated, the transmission of the virus from person to person may be stopped).</p>
<p>11:09 Caroline Alphonso: Here's another question from a reader:</p>
<p>Thanks for taking questions. Have there been any clinical trials done on pregnant women? What outcomes, beyond efficacy, were measured? Have any been through a peer-reviewed process to assess their methods? And even if they have, can we possibly have any longterm, reliable data on the effects on a fetus of this vaccine? Given what I perceive as a paucity of testing, I may be more given to take my chance with Tamiflu.</p>
<p>11:09 Kumanan: The first clinical trial of the H1N1 vaccine in pregnant women has just been launched by the US National Institutes of Health. This trial will examine the effect of the vaccine on women in their 2nd and third trimester. It will examine safety data and the response of the women’s immune systems to the vaccine. It will also examine whether the vaccine may provide some protection to the fetus. While this trial will use a different vaccine than Canada’s we should have some results from this study prior to the release of the vaccine here. Canada has recently decided to purchase non-adjuvanted vaccines for pregnant women and the vaccine that is being used in this trial is also does not have an adjuvant. There is good data on the safety of non-adjuvanted standard flu vaccines in pregnant women. We do know that pregnant women are a priority population to receive the vaccine because they appear to be having a higher complication rate from this particular virus.</p>
<p>11:11 [Comment From Guest ] Those that are against the vaccine site overwhelmingly site their fear and anger at the 'Big Pharma'. How can health officials overcome this argument in order to achieve 'herd immunity'?</p>
<p>11:12 Globe and Mail: Just a note for all the participants who have posted questions: Caroline will be feeding them into the discussion from time to time, so don't be concerned if your question hasn't shown up yet</p>
<p>11:15 [Comment From Jean ] When is this vaccine available and how to get it?</p>
<p>11:15 Kumanan: I agree that in some segments of the populations this can be a challenge. I think its important to emphasize that we have excellent public health professionals and vaccinologists in Canada and are fortunate in this respect. These people need to communicate openly and transparently their committment to protecting Canadians from the virus and the how the vaccine program is going to be both adminsitered and monitored. I understand that we will soon be implementing an adverse event monitoring system for the vaccine - this should be communicated to the public. Standardized information on the vaccine needs to be provided and this information should be all on their website. Public health officials should also look at more innovative ways to communicate with the public including using social media sites.</p>
<p>11:16 Caroline Alphonso: Hello Jean. Thanks for your question. Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the vaccine could be ready as early as October if the virus turns more severe. The latest it will be rolled out is mid-November. It's up to provinces to decide how they will deliver the vaccine, and that's being worked out at the moment.</p>
<p>11:17 [Comment From Guest ] Thanks Dr. Wilson,</p>
<p>11:17 Caroline Alphonso: Dr. Wilson, Here's a question posted by a reader:</p>
<p>I applaud the Globe for allowing this discussion. I am very concerned about the calls for mass vacinations of all school age children. Concidering the studies linking vacinations to an increased incidence of autism in children and the hosts of possible side effects linked to the ingrediants of the adjuvants, would not increased use of propholatic measures such as hand sanitizers be safer in reducing the spread of infections?</p>
<p>11:19 Kumanan: There have been numerous studies examining vaccines and autism and an association has not been supported. The US no-fault compensation court, with a low threshold for determining if a link exists also recently stated that no association exists. The US Institutes of Medicine also reviewed all of the evidence and said that there was no association.</p>
<p>School aged children need to be vaccinated for 2 reasons - first to protect themselves. In August the US CDC reported that 42 of the 556 H1N1 deaths were in children under 18. Second to protect others by preventing the ongoing spread of the virus. An interesting study in Japan found that when they immunized school children with the flu vaccine, influenza related death in the eldelry was reduced. When they stopped immunizing these children death increased again.</p>
<p>Prophylactic measures such as good hygiene should always be encouraged.</p>
<p>11:20 [Comment From Jenny ] Is it true that the longer a virus spreads, uncontrolled by vaccine, the more likely it is to mutate and be able to become resistant to vaccine?</p>
<p>11:21 Will you get the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>Yes ( 41% )</p>
<p>No ( 29% )</p>
<p>I'm not sure ( 30% )</p>
<p>11:22 Kumanan: yes, typically a new virus can rapidly mutate. However, preliminary studies have shown that this virus is relatively stable in this respect. This is good news as we develop the vaccine.</p>
<p>11:22 Caroline Alphonso: Another question posted by a reader:</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson, I am impressed that a physician of your high calibre, during such a busy season, is able to make time to help educate the public. Thank you for your contribution.</p>
<p>Reading some of the previous comments it is clear that most people are indeed in need of more information, especially with all the misinformation about the dangers of vaccination being circulated in the media. Next we'll be hearing that SweetTarts cure the flu!</p>
<p>What advice can you give to health care professionals who still have doubts about vaccination, both for H1N1 and the "regular" strains?</p>
<p>11:26 Kumanan: Thank you for the question. Healthcare professionals are a key group to be vaccinated. First they will be in contact with H1N1 patients and are at increased risk of contracting the virus and should be protected as our responsibility to them. Second, studies with the seasonal influenza vaccine suggest that vaccinating healthcare workers can reduce influenza illness and death in their patients. I think we need to adress health care workers fears about any vaccine side effects respectfully. Again, the safety monitoring of the vaccine needs to be conveyed to them. Many are worried about the risk of Guillain-Barre syndrome. This risk with the standard flu vaccine is no more than 1 in a million individuals vaccinated.</p>
<p>11:27 [Comment From Guest RN ] Is the planned vaccine one or two doses? Will high-risk populations receive 2 doses?</p>
<p>11:29 Caroline Alphonso: Thanks for your question, Guest RN. Health officials are planning on two doses, but with an adjuvant being used in Canada's vaccine, one dose could be sufficient. Clincial trials will tell us more over the next few weeks. And there's evidence today, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, that one dose may be enough.</p>
<p>11:29 [Comment From Peter ] Is there truly a need for the adjuvant as some preliminary studies have shown none is needed?</p>
<p>11:32 Kumanan: There are a few reasons why an adjuvant is being considered or viewed as needed. The first is that it allows us to use less of the active part of the vaccine so we can make more vaccines available. This is important in Canada. Its very important if we want to help developing countries by providing them with vaccine. The second reason, is that there is evidence to suggest that the adjuvant can be helpful in maintaining an immune response if the virus were to change.</p>
<p>11:33 Caroline Alphonso: Dr. Wilson, here's another question from a reader. There's been quite a few posted on the fact that front-line workers are reluctant to get the vaccine, so maybe you can address that through this question: As a health professional, I am not taking the vaccine. There was not enough studies. what are the long term effects? Quo bono?</p>
<p>There is too much hyper. Are you getting it yourself and your family and friends. I would like to see it before I consider to get any of it. I asked my doctor if he was going to get it and he was silent. I said: Good answer.</p>
<p>11:39 Kumanan: It is my personal belief that it is the responsibility of health care workers to get immunized to protect their patients so I do get the vaccine. I do realize there is a lot of concern amongst health care workers and getting good immunization rates with the seasonal flu vaccine has been a challenge. I am not sure how much more we can do to encourage vaccination rates because education programs have not had enough of an effect. In addition to monitoring for adverse events, health care workers and all Canadians should be told who to contact if they beleive they have developed an adverse event. I think all Canadians should also be provided with financial compensation if they develop an adverse event. While these last 2 points, in my opinion make for a fair system, I am not sure how much impact they would have on encouraging health care workers to get vaccinated.</p>
<p>11:41 [Comment From worried mom ] the virus is here now with one private school in Vancouver sending boarding students home...once a child has had the virus or been exposed, does it still make sense to be vaccinated?</p>
<p>11:42 Caroline Alphonso: Worried mom: Canada has purchased enough vaccine for all who want and need it, and in my conversations with health authorities, they recommend getting the vaccine even if you have been exposed. You should also consult your doctor.</p>
<p>11:42 Kumanan: If you have definately had the virus and this has been laboratorily confirmed - you likely don't need the vaccine. But I think this would not apply to many cases.</p>
<p>11:43 [Comment From Sandra ] Why do most people have an issue with the flu shot in general. I arrange for flu sho at my place of employment and 60% refuse and thing that the flu shot is a bad thing to do to your body? Is there any reason for the flu shut to have such a reputation?</p>
<p>11:45 [Comment From Michael ] Health authorities recommend getting the vaccine after you have been exposed? I like Kumanan's response better. If that were true, then I would definately question the rationale.</p>
<p>11:46 Kumanan: Again, I think the primary issue is that most people - in particular, young, health people - don't believe the vaccine is neccessary. This creates suspicion as to why they are being told they need to get the vaccine. With this virus, though, young health people may be more effected.</p>
<p>11:48 [Comment From Peter ] Does the addition of an adjuvant present an increased risk of GBS?</p>
<p>11:51 Kumanan: The issue of GBS is an interesting one. The risk of GBS with the 1976 vaccine was about 1 in 120 000 vaccinated. Some studies showed no association with susbequent seasonal vaccines. An Ontario study showed a risk of about 1 in a million individuals vaccinated.</p>
<p>Nobody is quite sure why the risk exists. There is no evidence linking adjuvants to GBS. If GBS is related to the part of the virus included in the vaccine then by reducing this amount through an adjuvant this risk may be reduced even further. However, I am speculating here.</p>
<p>11:52 [Comment From worried mom ] I appreciate the answers regarding vaccination after exposure or having had the flu. As I understand tho', health officials are no longer testing to confirm cases as H1N1...so how exactly is one to know if you have had it or been exposed?</p>
<p>11:53 [Comment From RG ] I may not be in Canada during the flu shot season, but will be in the USA. How different are the 2 flu vaccines (CDN vs USA). Which one is better to receive? If I can't manage to get one in Canada, should I get it while I am in the USA?</p>
<p>11:53 Kumanan: I dont think you can really know for sure. In a Nova Scotia cohort 40% of affected individuals didnt even have a fever. So its therefore safer to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>11:54 Does the use of an adjuvant in the H1N1 vaccine scare you?</p>
<p>Yes ( 77% )</p>
<p>No ( 23% )</p>
<p>11:56 Kumanan: Helllo RG,</p>
<p>The primary difference if that the US vaccine does not have an adjuvant and the Canadian vaccine does. The two studies in the New England Journal of Medicine today seem to suggest both approches can be effective. If you can't get the vaccine in Canada you should consider getting it in the US.</p>
<p>11:58 Caroline Alphonso: Thanks Dr. Wilson for joining us today. We're almost out of time, so do you have any final thoughts on the H1N1 vaccine?</p>
<p>12:02 Kumanan: Yes and thanks everybody for your questions.</p>
<p>First, I would again like to say we are fortunate in this country to have excellent people in our public health system. If their committment to Canadians can be effectively conveyed, I think this would reassure many people.</p>
<p>Second, I think the comments by some who feel they may not be able to get the vaccine and are worried demonstrate how we are all in this together. That by getting vaccinated we are not only providing protection to ourselves but to others.</p>
<p>And finally, I do believe the relationship goes both ways - that if we expect people to get vaccinated we need to reassure them that we are doing everything possible to monitor the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine. I am hoping we here more from our public health officials in this regard as I understand these systems are being developed.</p>
<p>12:03 Caroline Alphonso: Very good points, Dr. Wilson. Thanks again for joining us.</p>
<p>On-line guests, we're sorry we couldn't get to all your questions today. I'm sure we'll be hosting another one of these soon. If you have any other H1N1 questions, we welcome them.

<p>They say children are our greatest resource. They always say that, but especially around election time. Usually they say it even as they are scrapping a universal day-care plan in favour of more tax breaks or R&D money for the energy sector.</p>
<p>We have hypocrisy about children. That's because children and babies, while very cute in the photography of Anne Geddes, stuffed into garden planters and dinosaur costumes, are harder to bring along than oil. Even the oil in the tarsands.</p>
<p>Oil, for starters, doesn't fail math because it's spending too much time on World of Warcraft. And no matter how many children you get to push your car, it won't go as fast as when you bathe its pistons in gallons of exploding petroleum.</p>
<p>If children are indeed a resource, even if not our most efficient one, then I live on a resource-rich street in a resource-rich neighbourhood. Rarely is it more evident than on that special, ceremonial fork in the road of the year -- the first day of school.</p>
<p>Tuesday the sidewalks around our house were teeming. It was like a train station, with the little soldiers going off.</p>
<p>One little boy from up the street walked by and saw Ruby and Lucy on the lawn in their first-day-back clothes, chatting with the neighbour kids as Anne and I stood on the porch passing them stuff. Hair elastics, plastic spoons we'd forgotten to put in their lunch bags, sweaters (in case the weather turned) which the girls refused, rolling their eyes.</p>
<p>The morning was inflated with a sense of occasion, and the boy, grinning with it, school bag on his back, shouted out to us: "Hey, you people whose names I don't know, I'm starting the first grade!"</p>
<p>We all laughed and his mother, beside him, laughed too, blushing a little, in a proud kind of way.</p>
<p>It so happened that, because of the holiday Monday, garbage pickup in our area coincided with first day back. So there was this unusual confluence of little children, big trucks, and the customary strangers on bicycle and foot who swoop down on the neighbourhood every garbage morning to forage through blue boxes for wine bottles and other returnables, later to stand outside The Beer Store with their haul in shopping carts waiting for the doors to open.</p>
<p>Older folk on the block who happened to be out, maybe for a walk or to put in a last bit of forgotten garbage, would stop children they know, children they remember as babies, and say, "Good luck today," or "What grade are you going into now?"</p>
<p>You could hear in their tone, and in the pre-autumnal breeze that even now is beginning to pry the leaves slowly off the trees, the swirling around of all the years as they come and go and mix themselves up in the eddies of our memories.</p>
<p>The kids are pushing out for another campaign. What are they going to learn? What use will they put it to? We send them off with the wind of our hopes in their sails. But we know that much or at least some of what they encounter will seem to them painful and awkward.</p>
<p>Our own school years seem almost like a dream now. I can fix about three things in my head from all my grades of math. Of functions, nothing. Of history, little more. I think Jacques Cartier once said, "Black flies, beeg as sparrows, mon dieu. Ze only thing this country will ever be good for is same-sex marriage."</p>
<p>I told my girls as they left for school Tuesday, "Watch out for the wasps." They didn't know what I meant. There's a plague of them this late summer. Worse than swine flu. They're harrying patrons clear off restaurant patios.</p>
<p>My girls just shook their heads. Crazy dad. I just don't want them to get stung.</p>
<p>One thing I do remember from history is how politicians through the ages have had it backwards, squandering our so-called greatest resource to stoke the engines of wars being fought for lesser resources such as oil, water and land, often disguised as national honour.</p>
<p>Still it happens. Maybe that's why we keep going back to school. We know how much we don't know. We still have a world, and ourselves, to learn. We have the children to teach us.</p>

<p>Information on flu shots coming from province</p>
<p>Ontario is helping to prepare residents for the upcoming flu season when there will be two types of viruses circulating.</p>
<p>Two flu vaccines are being developed and will be made available -- one against the seasonal flu viruses and one against the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Beginning next week, every home in Ontario will be receiving information in the mail regarding vaccination programs, contact information and tips on prevention and how to stay healthy.</p>
<p>"I strongly encourage everyone to take the personal precautions we clearly spell out in this brochure to prevent the spread of flu in Ontario this autumn," said Dr. Arlene King, chief medical officer of health.</p>

<p>Yoga is found to relieve chronic lower back pain</p>
<p>A study shows practising yoga can help ease chronic lower back pain.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers divided 90 adults, who had mild to moderate functional disability as a result of back pain, into two groups.</p>
<p>One group did 90-minute yoga sessions twice a week for six months.</p>
<p>The other group continued whatever medical therapy or treatments they'd been doing.</p>
<p>At three and six months, a greater proportion of those who did yoga reported improvements in their pain and functioning.</p>
<p>Yoga participants also reported fewer depression symptoms.</p>
<p>The study is in the September issue of Spine.</p>
<p>Lead linked to higher risk of heart-disease death</p>
<p>New research shows exposure to lead over a lifetime may increase the risk of dying from heart disease.</p>
<p>Researchers analyzed lead concentrations in the blood and bones of 868 men from the Boston area who participated in a study of aging veterans.</p>
<p>The men, whose average age was 67 at the start of the study, had lead concentrations in their blood, their kneecaps and shin bones measured over a nine-year period. During the course of the study, 241 died.</p>
<p>Researchers found the men who had the highest concentrations of lead in their bones had a six times greater chance of dying from cardiovascular disease than men with the lowest concentrations.</p>
<p>The study appears in the current issue of Circulation.</p>
<p>Infections can aggravate Alzheimer's memory loss</p>
<p>British researchers say even minor infections can double the rate of memory loss in Alzheimer's patients.</p>
<p>Researchers found Alzheimer's patients who had respiratory, gastrointestinal or other infections -- even minor bumps and bruises -- can have high levels of TNFa in their blood.</p>
<p>TNFa is a protein linked to inflammation and has been associated with memory loss or other types of cognitive decline.</p>
<p>The report is published in the current issue of Neurology.</p>
<p>Green tea reduces risk of all-cause mortality</p>
<p>Green tea has been extensively studied for its potential preventive and therapeutic roles, especially for cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer.</p>
<p>To further explore the potential benefits of this healthy potion, Elsevier's Annals of Epidemiology focused specifically on a population of 14,001 elderly residents in Japan during a six-year span from December 1999 to March 2006.</p>
<p>At the end of the trial, 12,251 individuals were analyzed to estimate the hazard ratios for all-cause mortality, cancer and CVD.</p>
<p>For those who consumed seven or more cups of green tea per day compared to those who consumed less than one cup per day, the risk of all-cause and CVD mortality was 55 per cent and 75 per cent lower respectively.</p>
<p>In addition, green tea consumption was associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer mortality.</p>
<p>These findings suggest that encouraging individuals to drink green tea could be an easy, cost-effective lifestyle recommendation to improve health for the young and old.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Guides, Scouts look to new century; Organizations reinvent themselves with updated dress, disaster preparedness training</b>
</div><div>Shannon Proudfoot   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>558 words</div><div>10 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Early</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>A new season of Scouts and Girl Guides is kicking off, and both century-old organizations are reinventing themselves in an effort to buoy flagging memberships and show they're relevant to a generation more worried about cyber-bullying than charred marshmallows.</p>
<p>The Girl Guides of Canada has introduced a body-image badge and launched an online film festival, while Scouts Canada is discarding its iconic tan uniforms and teaching disaster preparedness for H1N1 and hurricane season.</p>
<p>"People see us as all about cookies, and we are so much more than cookies," says Linda Crawford, director of operations for Girl Guides of Canada. "It provides (girls) with leadership opportunities, and it's in a very safe, non-threatening, all-female environment."</p>
<p>The organization is kicking off its 100th anniversary celebration in January, and has just launched a new advertising campaign and online film festival called Perspectives on a Girl, featuring short films by Canadian artists meditating on what it means to be a girl these days. The ad campaign positions Guides as the antidote to the hyper-sexed, pressurized landscape where modern girls live.</p>
<p>Girl Guides has also introduced distinctly 21st-century badges on topics such as AIDS awareness and body-image -- the latter in partnership with the National Eating Disorder Information Centre.</p>
<p>The heyday for the Girl Guides of Canada was the 1980s, with a membership of about 200,000. It is now down to about 90,000.</p>
<p>Scouts Canada membership peaked at around 320,000 in Canada in the 1960s, says Steve Kent, chief commissioner, and fell to about 96,000 in recent years.</p>
<p>Efforts to reinvent scouting appear to be paying off, however, because membership has floated back up to about 100,000, about 20 per cent of whom are female.</p>
<p>"The Scouts Canada of today is not your father's or your grandfather's Boy Scouts," he says. "I think because of our history, people have an antiquated view of scouting."</p>
<p>For starters, they aren't called the Boy Scouts any longer, having been coed for more than a decade, he says, but many people still don't know that.</p>
<p>The "be prepared" motto has morphed into disaster preparedness training for Scouts of all ages, Kent says, which is particularly relevant amid today's pandemic fears and natural disasters.</p>
<p>Scouts Canada and Girl Guides say they now get their young members more involved in shaping their programs and policies, and in both cases this resulted in a loosening of uniform requirements. The Scouts have replaced their traditional uniforms with T-shirts, and Girl Guides have "modernized" their dress code, Crawford says.</p>
<p>"We have steered away from the traditional uniforms, which were skirts and dresses and pinafores," she says. "They're now much more aligned with clothes that girls can wear everyday-- T-shirts, cargo pants, jeans."</p>
<p>Scouts Canada, meanwhile, connects with existing and potential members through leader blogs and its <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, Twitter and <span class="companylink">YouTube</span> accounts, and in large urban centres, it's reaching out to new Canadians with program materials and troops in several languages, Kent says.</p>

<p>Re: Flu fears must be kept in perspective, expert says, by Sharon Kirkey, Sept. 8</p>
<p>In this article, I was struck by expert Steven Crimando's assertion (with regard to the H1N1 virus) that people are often more afraid of what they don't know about than things about which they have some knowledge.</p>
<p>I handled communications for a global airline during the 2003 SARS outbreak and also spent time at a university medical centre trying to defuse other crises. I definitely agree that when people muster the strength to look beyond their fears to learn as much as possible about a medical situation, they often find things aren't quite so scary.</p>
<p>It's up to people to decide whether they will let fear conquer them or whether they will listen to health professionals and wash their hands often, get flu vaccines as appropriate, and stay away from others when they are sick.</p>
<p>Even if they take these measures, there's no guarantee H1N1 infection won't occur.</p>
<p>But if we all do our best to avoid contracting swine flu, far fewer people are likely to get it. That doesn't sound so scary, does it?</p>

<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>974 words</div><div>10 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final C</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The front line in the battle against provincial government cutbacks has formed in Vancouver where centre-left majorities on city council and school board have passed emergency motions calling for more money on everything from leaky condo repairs to arts and culture grants to building upgrades for schools.</p>
<p>"We need to send a strong message to the province that cuts to these various areas are unacceptable," Vision Vancouver Coun. Raymond Louie said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We're trying our best to protect our taxpayers from this downloading from the province," added Louie who introduced the motion to council Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The motion passed by Vancouver city council Tuesday night says the budget update introduced by the provincial government -- and the cuts to grants and other funding it contains -- will "negatively impact many citizens across Vancouver" and will have a "potentially detrimental impact" on the city's current budget preparations.</p>
<p>It states that Mayor Gregor Robertson will now write Premier Gordon Campbell, Finance Minister Colin Hansen and others, urging them to: "Rescind cuts and implement robust and sustainable levels of funding to the areas of concern to Vancouver citizens including arts and culture, public education,transit, leaky condo repairs, public libraries, sport and recreation and childcare."</p>
<p>The motion passed with unanimous support on all but one resolution, which centre-right NPA Coun. Suzanne Anton opposed.</p>
<p>Vancouver school board held an emergency meeting Wednesday where trustees from the centre-left Vision and COPE majority similarly attacked provincial cuts.</p>
<p>The school board urged the B.C. Liberal government at an emergency meeting Wednesday to rescind funding cuts they say could force school closures and layoffs.</p>
<p>The meeting was called in response to Victoria's decision to eliminate $110 million in annual facilities grants, which school boards use to maintain and upgrade property.</p>
<p>The VSB was counting on $10.6 million from these annual grants to maintain and upgrade buildings. VSB chairwoman Patti Bacchus said just before the meeting that the ministry of education will allow the VSB to pull $7.4 million from a reserve fund -- and has suggested that school boards may be allowed to run deficit budgets, which is normally not allowed under provincial legislation.</p>
<p>Despite the eleventh-hour reprieve, the VSB still faces a funding crisis, said Bacchus.</p>
<p>"The sudden and unexpected impact of these funding cuts at the beginning of the school year have really thrown us into disarray at a time when we should be focusing on getting a positive start to the school year," said Bacchus.</p>
<p>The VSB chairwoman said the board conducted an extensive budget process this spring to deal with a $7.2 million shortfall -- "and now we are suddenly getting funding announcements right before the start of the school year."</p>
<p>The VSB unanimously passed resolutions calling on the province to restore funding of the annual facilities grants (AFG) and to urge the B.C. Schools Trustees Association to develop a province-wide advocacy program to oppose education spending cutbacks.</p>
<p>Vision Vancouver trustee Sharon Gregson said that the VSB has to oppose the provincial cutbacks or else it would be "complicit" in the erosion of public education.</p>
<p>"I just want to go on record as saying how disappointing it is that our provincial government obviously does not care about the kids of Vancouver," Gregson said at the meeting.</p>
<p>Vision trustee Mike Lombardi said the provincial cuts mean that needed upgrades in schools will have to be postponed. "I was elected as a trustee to stand up for the kids of Vancouver and I am terribly upset at the decisions of the provincial government to cancel the [AFG] grant. It's an example of irresponsible planning and it puts boards in an untenable position of having to make decisions which are not in the best interests of public education and our kids."</p>
<p>The VSB are voted to request the province to provide enough funds for the school boards to cover costs related to the H1N1 virus and for the cost of increased MSP premiums for employees. The board also voted to give school boards a 75-per-cent HST rebate, that is being provided municipalities.</p>
<p>The move by Vision Vancouver politicians to criticize the B.C. Liberal government is a departure. Mayor Robertson and his council have publicly been offering support in most areas for Campbell and his government.</p>
<p>"Because of how sensitive they've been towards Victoria, it's quite something for them to come out this strongly," said New Democratic Party critic for tourism, culture and the arts, Spencer Herbert.</p>
<p>"To have them come out this way in an emergency motion speaks, I think, to the severity this budget will have on British Columbia."</p>
<p>The Vision motion at city council also calls on the province to restore all direct-access gambling funding.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Louie said city council is simply trying to look out for Vancouver residents.</p>
<p>"We speak out loudly when there are things to reward," he said.</p>
<p>"And I think this council will speak out loudly when we believe our citizens are in jeopardy as a result of decisions made by other levels of government," he added.</p>
<p>"People have to realize Vancouver has already accepted a significant amount of responsibility for our social problems, and is trying to invest in positive initiatives like early childhood learning and we are tapped."</p>
<p>Hansen and Coleman were both unavailable for comment on the matter Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tuesday's urgent motion began with a measure proposed by COPE Coun. Ellen Woodsworth, who introduced a motion meant specifically to target cuts made by the province to arts funding.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Farmers COOL to protectionism</b>
</div><div>Milton Boyd   </div>

</p>
<p>Following is the viewpoint of the writer, an economist at the University of Manitoba and a policy adviser to the Frontier Centre for Public Policy.</p>
<p>Struggling American livestock producers, hit hard by the recent economic downturn and the drop in demand for meat in the United States, have spurred recent trade protectionism measures that include country of origin labelling regulations (COOL).</p>
<p>These essentially require U.S. meat processors to segregate live Canadian cattle and hogs from U.S. animals. Any packages containing Canadian meat must be labelled as such -- a requirement that has been costly for most U.S. processors who have consequently become unwilling to accept Canadian animals at all.</p>
<p>COOL has resulted in a tightened, protectionist border. Canadian hog exports to the U.S. have dropped to 585,000 pigs from January through June. That compares to 1.4 million for the same period a year earlier -- about a 60 per cent drop.</p>
<p>At market value of $100 per hog, this loss is around $81.5 million, or $163 million over a full year (not to mention a 30 per cent drop in feeder pig exports). Also, slaughter cattle exports are down 20 per cent and feeder cattle exports are down by 50 per cent.</p>
<p>In May 2009, Canada requested a WTO consultation to object to the American regulations. While the U.S. administration and Democrats in the House and Senate talk free trade, their actions have been the opposite and have restricted trade.</p>
<p>These restrictions are being championed by a small number of U.S. agricultural producer groups, primarily R-CALF and the National Farmers Union -- U.S. agriculture groups that represent only a minority of farmers but who successfully lobbied Washington to impose the COOL regulations.</p>
<p>Part of the dispute is related to the new U.S. secretary of Agriculture, who has decided to aggressively enforce the country of origin labelling. But this isn't surprising, since President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton both stated in last year's presidential debates they would consider renegotiating NAFTA and were supported by anti-trade groups.</p>
<p>Keeping U.S. and international markets open for Canadian livestock is especially important for the financial survival of Canadian producers. They have been hit hard by high feed grain prices that have been driven up by U.S. ethanol policy, weak livestock prices, a strong loonie, mad-cow disease-related border closures to cattle and H1N1-related border closures for pork to some countries.</p>
<p>Enforcing country-of-origin labelling was a further blow.</p>
<p>In the long term, a U.S. market loss for Canadian live animals would require building more meat processing capacity in Canada. More exports of Canadian processed beef and pork would go to Asia, given the rising Asian income and growing market, since it's too expensive to ship live animals to Asia.</p>
<p>However, Canada's meat processing plant size is smaller and less cost-competitive than the huge U.S. plants, and so Canada still needs to export live animals to the U.S., especially in the short-term.</p>
<p>For now, fighting COOL is the first priority for Canada. With a population a tenth that of the U.S. and 75 per cent of its trade dependent on the U.S., Canada also must band together with other countries to convince the Obama administration to drop its outdated and wrong-headed trade restrictions before they get worse.</p>
<p>For example, the disastrous Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 saw U.S. tariffs increased on 20,000 products as a means to rescue the U.S. from an economic downturn. Trade fell by 65 per cent and unemployment hit 25 per cent. That failure should serve as a reminder of the dangers of protectionism now.</p>
<p>Archaic trade restrictions from the U.S. administration eight decades ago brought the world economy to its knees, and they're still nonsensical today.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Olympic school programs hit</b>
</div><div>Kimberly Shearon </div>

<div>380 words</div><div>9 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province </div>
</p>
<p>The B.C. government rolled out its Olympic education programs yesterday to less than enthusiastic support from teachers and school boards.</p>
<p>The province spent $550,000 during the past three years developing the programs.</p>
<p>"We felt it was a very good investment considering the education opportunities that there are with the Olympics this year," said B.C. Education Minister Margaret MacDiarmid.</p>
<p>But B.C. Teachers Federation president Irene Lanzinger was skeptical.</p>
<p>"The government keeps coming out with these feel-good announcements," she said. "It's all about some kind of spin they're putting on what is really an underfunding of the public system."</p>
<p>The programs, she said, fail to tackle tough Olympic issues, such as drug testing, corruption and whether Vancouver should be hosting the Games.</p>
<p>"This is an advertising campaign for the Olympics. It's not an educational program."</p>
<p>The unveiling at False Creek Elementary School came on the heels of school funding cuts. Last week's provincial budget has school boards scrambling to make up for a $110-million shortfall in facility grants.</p>
<p>The Vancouver School Board had its $10.6-million facility grant yanked "with no warning," said board chairwoman Patti Bacchus.</p>
<p>She said the district will also have to spend "several hundred thousand dollars" to bring schools in line with provincial health regulations related to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The province, MacDiarmid said, has put more dollars than ever into school funding.</p>
<p>Bacchus, however, said that while the dollar figure itself might be the highest ever, the year-over-year increase does not keep pace with fixed costs and negotiated contracts.</p>
<p>The Olympic-themed education initiative also rubbed salt in the wound left by a $130,000 cut to school sport funding.</p>
<p>Last week, MacDiarmid suggested students get exercise by walking, dancing or going to the park if their school sport program gets cut.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bacchus said the district is facing the possibility of "significant layoffs."</p>
<p>"We're suddenly in a position where we're literally spending money today that we don't have."</p>

<p>In what might be the first -- likely not the last -- human rights case to come out of the H1N1 pandemic, a Manitoba man has filed a complaint against a restaurant for allegedly denying him service after his wife was diagnosed with H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"He just wants an apology," Floyd Carlson's wife, Roberta, said Tuesday from their home in Pinawa, about 110 kilometres northeast of Winnipeg. "If they do it to one person, they'll do it to another. They're diagnosing people."</p>
<p>Roberta said she was hit by the flu June 15 and within days found herself at the Health Sciences Centre in Winnipeg hooked up to a ventilator and multiple IV bags.</p>
<p>"I don't remember any of it," she said. "I was in a coma."</p>
<p>She was discharged Aug. 5.</p>
<p>On July 2 her husband, a trucker, stopped in the nearby community of Seven Sisters Falls for a meal, she said.</p>
<p>He had barely stepped through the door when the proprietor stopped him in his tracks.</p>
<p>Roberta, 53, said her husband was told that he couldn't come in because his wife was sick.</p>
<p>She said her husband recently filed a complaint against the restaurant with the Manitoba Human Rights Commission.</p>
<p>Tina Lehman of Seven Sisters Motel and Restaurant said she's already apologized to Carlson, but added she stands by her decision.</p>
<p>"I've got nothing to hide," she said. "I just thought I was making the right decision. There's a lot of people in this town who agree with me.</p>
<p>"I feel bad about the whole situation," Lehman added. "He's a good customer. But I have to look after the welfare of my other customers."</p>
<p>Roberta added she thinks she caught H1N1 days earlier when she was visiting with friends who had just returned from Mexico and were complaining they weren't feeling well. She said the bug hit her especially hard, attacking her lungs, because she has asthma.</p>
<p>It's estimated that about 10 per cent of Manitobans have been infected with H1N1.</p>

<div>FOOD FOR THOUGHT / NUTRITION / THE SICK SEASON</div>

<div id="hd"><b>Boost your immunity with these flu fighters</b>
</div><div>LESLIE BECK </div>
<div>1074 words</div><div>9 September 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>With kids back in school, flu season is top of mind for many parents. Resurgent H1N1 virus, seasonal influenza and the common cold are expected to bring sneezing, coughing, aches and chills.</p>
<p>While you can't prevent these viruses from making their fall appearance, a healthy diet can bolster your immune system making it better prepared to respond. The right nutrients and certain supplements may also help ease cold and flu symptoms. Flu season starts in October and lasts until April and colds typically occur between September and May. It's no coincidence we get sick more often during the fall and winter.</p>
<p>Cooler temperatures keep us indoors where we're more likely to come into prolonged contact with others who are infected.</p>
<p>Vitamin D is thought to play a role in seasonal flu. The nutrient increases the body's production of proteins that destroy viruses, including influenza. Given that vitamin D is synthesized in our skin on exposure to sunlight, low blood levels of the vitamin in the winter months may make us more susceptible to getting the flu. Canadian researchers are currently investigating vitamin D for swine flu protection.</p>
<p>Your first defence against colds and flu is good personal hygiene. Frequent and thorough hand washing, covering your mouth when coughing or sneezing, and cleaning surfaces that you touch with germ-killing disinfectant will help protect you, your family and your co-workers from infection-causing germs.</p>
<p>Adequate sleep also helps guard against infection. Sleep deprivation disrupts immune function and increases levels of proteins in the body associated with inflammation. Aim for seven to eight hours of sleep each night; children and teenagers need nine to 10 hours.</p>
<p>A healthy immune system also needs regular exercise. Studies show that physically active people get fewer colds each year than do their sedentary peers. But don't overdo it. Intense workouts or prolonged endurance exercise steps up the production of stress hormones, which can hinder the body's ability to fight infection. Aim to get 30 to 60 minutes of light to moderate activity most days of the week.</p>
<p>When it comes to nutrition, a healthy diet that includes protein and plenty of fruit and vegetables will help build a strong immune system. While no single food or supplement is guaranteed to keep winter viruses away, studies suggest the following strategies may help.</p>
<p>Vitamin C</p>
<p>Although this nutrient promotes the body's production of immune compounds, there's little evidence that taking vitamin C can prevent colds and flu in average folks. However, in individuals under physical stress (such as marathon runners), supplementing with vitamin C cuts the risk of developing a cold in half.</p>
<p>Vitamin C does seem to lessen cold symptoms in adults and kids. A review of 30 studies involving 11,350 participants concluded that vitamin C reduced the duration of colds.</p>
<p>To reduce cold symptoms, 2,000 milligrams of vitamin C a day, taken in divided doses, appears to be most effective. Children, people under physical stress and those with low dietary intakes of vitamin C tend to respond best to this vitamin.</p>
<p>High doses of vitamin C may increase the risk of oxalate kidney stones. People with a history of kidney stones should restrict their intake to 100 milligrams a day.</p>
<p>Vitamin D The advice for Canadian adults to take a vitamin D supplement in fall and winter to help reduce cancer risk may also protect from the flu by enhancing the body's immune system.</p>
<p>Take 1,000 IU (international units) of vitamin D each day throughout the fall and winter. Older adults, people with dark skin, those who don't go outdoors often and those who wear clothing that covers most of their skin should take the supplement year-round.</p>
<p>Children should supplement with 400 IU a day.</p>
<p>Zinc</p>
<p>This mineral is vital to a healthy immune system. Foods rich in zinc include oysters, seafood, red meat, poultry, yogurt, wheat bran, wheat germ, whole grains and enriched breakfast cereals. Your diet and a multivitamin and mineral supplement will provide all the zinc you need to stay healthy.</p>
<p>Zinc lozenges can reduce the duration of cold symptoms. Compared to cold sufferers taking placebo pills, those taking zinc gluconate or zinc acetate lozenges experienced faster recovery from coughing, sore throat, runny nose and headache.</p>
<p>Echinacea</p>
<p>This herb enhances the body's production of white blood cells that fight infection. The most recent review of 16 randomized trials concluded that the majority of studies report a positive effect, most notably when supplements of Echinacea purpurea (Eastern purple coneflower or Purple coneflower) were used.</p>
<p>Echinacea should be taken until symptoms are relieved and then continued two to three times daily for one week.</p>
<p>Ginseng</p>
<p>A special extract of North American ginseng, sold as COLD-fX (<span class="companylink">Afexa Life Sciences Inc</span>.), can help treat colds and flu. A 2008 study of 323 healthy adults who had suffered at least two colds the previous year, found that compared to those taking a placebo, people who took COLD-fX were 26 per cent less likely to get a cold. Among those who did get colds, half were less likely to catch a second one.</p>
<p>The recommended does is 200 milligrams, twice daily, during cold and flu season. While COLD-fX shows promise for healthy adults, it has not been tested in children or the elderly.</p>
<p>Probiotics</p>
<p>These “friendly” strains of bacteria added to yogurt and sold as supplements are thought to stimulate the immune system. In adults, taking a daily supplement containing lactobacilli and bifidobacteria has been shown to reduce the severity and duration of colds and flu.</p>
<p>Probiotics may also be useful in preventing colds and flu in children. A study published last month in Pediatrics found that healthy children, aged 3 to 5, who took probiotics during the fall and winter suffered significantly less fever, coughs, antibiotic use and missed school days.</p>
<p>To supplement, buy a product that contains 1 billion to 10 billion live cells per dose (capsule). Choose a probiotic supplement that contains both lactobacilli and bifidobacteria strains. Children's products are available on the market; these usually contain one-quarter to one-half of the adult dose.</p>

<p>Fear of H1N1 flu will stop devout Neapolitans from performing the time-honoured ritual of kissing the blood of their patron Saint Gennaro when the city's annual festival begins later this month. The decision to forbid kissing of the glass phial containing the saint's blood was taken reluctantly by ecclesiastical and city authorities on Monday. The phial will be put on display in the city's cathedral for a week from Sept. 19 and the faithful will be allowed to touch it only with their foreheads. In one of Italy's best-known festivals, Saint Gennaro's dried blood is said to liquefy twice a year, 17 centuries after his death. Some Neapolitans fear disaster may strike the city if the "miracle" does not occur.</p>

</p>
<p>A student at St. George's School in Vancouver has contracted the H1N1 virus, a health official said yesterday.</p>
<p>Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer for Vancouver Coastal Health, said she was aware of one confirmed case of H1N1 at the boarding school.</p>
<p>A letter to parents posted on the school's website said most boarding students have gone home and those remaining are under supervision. Day students are continuing to attend classes.</p>
<p>The letter said absenteeism among day students was low and there was no evidence of an outbreak.</p>
<p>But the school said its doctor and health officials recommended that boarders remain home today, when the school would issue another notice indicating if boarders could return.</p>
<p>Daly, however, said only students who feel ill should stay home.</p>
<p>"I think the school did this out of an abundance of caution," she said. "As long as they're not sick, they can go to school."</p>

<p>At-risk folks urged to consider flu drugs</p>
<p>Public health officials are suggesting that pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions who are at higher risk from swine flu should talk with their doctors about rapid access to antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>They suggest doctors could work out some sort of arrangement that would allow these patients to quickly obtain the flu drugs Tamiflu or Relenza if they start coming down with symptoms of the flu.</p>
<p>The drugs, which block virus replication, work best when taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says most people who get swine flu won't need antiviral drugs, but those who do need to start treatment early.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones objects, however, to the idea of people filling a prescription before they get sick and stockpiling the drugs at home.</p>
<p>Severe depression raises risk of death</p>
<p>New York researchers say certain depressed patients who suffer from heart disease have nearly double the risk of dying within a seven-year period compared with other depressed patients.</p>
<p>Researchers say the patients most at risk are those who suffer from the most severe depression within a few weeks of being hospitalized for a cardiac event, such as a heart attack.</p>
<p>Those whose depression doesn't get better within six months are also at the most risk.</p>
<p>The study is published in the September issue of Archives of General Psychiatry.</p>
<p>Lifestyle changes halve cancer risk</p>
<p>Women can cut their risk of breast cancer by almost half if they watch their weight, exercise daily, breast-feed their babies and limit alcoholic beverages, according to a new report by the American Institute for Cancer Research.</p>
<p>The report updates a 2007 review of more than 800 studies, adding information from 81 new studies, said Susan Higginbotham, director of research for the institute.</p>
<p>Preventive steps include maintaining a healthy body weight, engaging in 30 to 60 minutes of physical activity a day, breast-feeding and limiting alcohol to one drink a day.</p>
<p>The role of hormones in breast cancer, including both postmenopausal hormone therapy and oral contraceptives, was not examined.</p>
<p>To reduce the risk of cancer generally, Higginbotham said, diets should be mostly plant-based, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, beans and whole grains and limiting red meat.</p>
<p>The recommendations are based on observational studies that have found associations between the behaviours and a reduced risk of breast cancer, but such studies do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.</p>
<p>Obesity surgery helps mom and child</p>
<p>Children born to women who had bariatric surgery for obesity may face a lower risk of severe obesity themselves, a study suggests.</p>
<p>The study, of 111 children born to 49 mothers who had a type of weight-loss surgery called biliopancreatic diversion, found that babies born after the operation had lower birth weights than those born before, and their risk of becoming severely obese as children was one-third the risk of those born before.</p>
<p>Children born after the operation also had better cholesterol levels and improved insulin sensitivity, indicating they might be less likely to develop heart disease and diabetes later in life, the researchers found.</p>
<p>However, the paper, to be published in The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism, cautions that the findings are based on observation of the children and bariatric surgery can lead to complications such as anemia, malnutrition, loss of bone density and, rarely, death.</p>
<p>Dr. John Kral of SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, said the benefits to the children might be due to metabolic and hormonal changes in the wombs of women who have had the operation.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Government cuts grants for parents' school groups; Councils will receive only half as much from gambling revenue as last year</b>

</p>
<p>Parent advisory councils in B.C. schools will receive only half as much money in gambling grants this year as they did last year, Education Minister Margaret MacDiarmid revealed Tuesday at an event intended to celebrate the start of a new school year.</p>
<p>That news, along with dire warnings from the Vancouver board of education that it's facing a financial crisis this year, took the shine off a gathering at False Creek elementary, organized by the education ministry to promote the use of 2010 Winter Olympics educational materials in the classroom.</p>
<p>Ann Whiteaker, president of the B.C. Confederation of Parent Advisory Councils, was caught off guard when told by The Vancouver Sun of the government's decision. She had just prepared a news release urging parents to lobby government to preserve the grants, which amounted to $20 per student last year.</p>
<p>"I'm very upset," Whiteaker said in an interview. "It's going to have an impact in the classroom."</p>
<p>In the past, the grants have complemented fundraising efforts and allowed parents to purchase playground equipment, pay for field trips, buy computers, software and books and organize cultural and sporting events.</p>
<p>Poor schools will be particularly hard hit by the reduction because their parents struggle to raise money independently, Whiteaker said.</p>
<p>"They are the ones that need more services . . . and they're the ones that are going to be hit even more."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid, who mentioned the grant reduction in a scrum, said she expects most parents will support the decision, given the province's difficult financial situation.</p>
<p>Parents have been waiting for word about parent advisory council (PAC) gambling-revenue grants for weeks, ever since the government announced that all such grants were under review. The minister responsible, Rich Coleman, told some groups about the future of their grants last week, but there was still no word about the PAC money.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Vancouver board of education has called an emergency meeting for tonight to discuss what chairwoman Patti Bacchus has described as a funding crisis arising from a government decision to cancel this year's annual facility grant to school districts. Vancouver's share of the $110 million grant was $10.6 million.</p>
<p>That cut, plus years of operating grants that failed to cover rising costs, have created a situation so dire that trustees will have to consider school closures this year, Bacchus said in an interview. Vancouver has closed only one small annex this decade, despite steadily declining enrollments.</p>
<p>"We're in a funding crisis," she said, listing a number of rising costs such as salaries and benefits, H1N1 flu preventive measures, MSP premiums and the new HST. "It's a difficult time for us."</p>
<p>MacDiarmid agreed times are tough but noted that government has again increased per-pupil funding, to $8,323 this year. The total operating grant to B.C.'s 60 school districts is $4.55 billion, an $84-million hike from last year.</p>
<p>In cancelling this year's facility grant, MacDiarmid said she asked districts to postpone unnecessary projects -- such as painting -- and use the $98.5-million accumulated surplus from last year's grant for repairs and upgrades.</p>
<p>"These are challenging times," she said, noting the government's $2.8-billion deficit.</p>
<p>Funding concerns derailed her good-news announcement about educational resources and programs that teachers can use to help students understand and celebrate the 2010 Winter Olympics. Later, she said those resources cost $500,000, but the expenditure would be shared by several ministries.</p>
<p>In Victoria, New Democratic Party leader Carole James criticized the grant cuts.</p>
<p>"If you don't take care of the ongoing maintenance, it's actually going to cost you more in the end instead of taking care of it as you go along," James said while standing in a boiler room at Victoria high school.</p>
<p>Michael McEvoy, a Victoria trustee and vice-president of the B.C. School Trustees Association, said he thinks the government is wrong to cancel the grants, even given the current economic environment.</p>
<p>"I think it is an unreasonable position for them to take," McEvoy said.</p>
<p>"Anything you hear about surpluses, that is illusory," he said, adding that the alleged surpluses comprise money being saved up for large-scale capital projects, such as boiler replacements and other expensive jobs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>An off-putting air of entitlement</b>

<p>If there is one thing Michael Ignatieff, the much-travelled author, academic and descendant of Russian (not to mention Toronto) nobility, least wants to have trailing behind him, it is any whiff of entitlement. The party he leads, the Liberals, is already notorious for acting as if it had a natural right to govern. Adding his own sense of destiny to the mix can only hurt the Liberals' chances in the fall general election that he has all but made an inevitability.</p>
<p>Thus, it is not the smartest move for the Liberals to feature Mr. Ignatieff in a new English-language television ad that sells his party with the slogan, “We can do better,” and then defines “better” as having a government that “thinks big, has a global perspective.” A Conservative spokesman has already written off this vague bromide as an appeal to “snobs.” In the sense that “snob,” to a Conservative, means a Toronto sophisticate with a well-stamped passport and a sense of superiority, that spokesman may have a point.</p>
<p>There are, indeed, many things Canada can do better, both domestically and in its foreign relations. A quick survey of the issues raised in this space in recent weeks provides some useful examples: managing the economic recovery and the deficit it has spawned; the rights of Canadians held in foreign lands; preparedness for the swine flu; our future role in Afghanistan. There are plenty of specific areas in which the Liberal Leader could clearly differentiate his vision from that of the Harper government.</p>
<p>But that is not what Mr. Ignatieff has done in his first foray into our living rooms since announcing on Sept. 2 that his party will no longer support the Conservative minority government in the House of Commons. Instead, appearing in a sylvan setting that implies some kind of emergence from a political wilderness, the internationalist Mr. Ignatieff has grafted the faintly headmasterish admonishment “We can do better” to the logo of the Liberal Party, and then left it to viewers to imagine what he means by that.</p>
<p>This is not a message that is going to woo away Conservative voters, who are rightly suspicious of anything that implies that global perspectives and thinking big are qualities only a well-travelled Liberal can possess. Nor does it give third-party voters a reason to jump ship. So what is the real purpose of the ad, if not to reinforce Liberal supporters' misguided belief that theirs is the natural governing party of this country?</p>
<p>Michael Ignatieff wants Canadians to vote in their fourth federal election in six years. He is asking them to choose between his party and the alternatives, without presenting any solid reason to make such a choice. He, more than anyone, needs to do better.</p>

</p>
<p>Dr. Brian Postl will resign next summer after 11 years as president and chief executive officer of the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority.</p>
<p>The 57-year-old Postl said Tuesday he wants to work another 10 years, preferably in Winnipeg, and may apply for the job of dean of medicine at the University of Manitoba, which comes open next July 1.</p>
<p>Postl said he's been thinking for several months it was time to move on "to direct myself to something new and different" after a decade in the demanding job.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure there was any one reason," Postl said. "I decided that I would think about it over the summer.</p>
<p>"You didn't want to leave too close to an election," said Postl, pointing both to next month's NDP leadership and to the fixed-date provincial election in October of 2011.</p>
<p>He's giving notice now to allow the WRHA board time to find a successor, Postl said.</p>
<p>"I thought the region was in pretty good management structure," he said. "We've really been able to evolve into a health system instead of a collection of activities that played together from time to time."</p>
<p>Postl said wait times have been reduced and the WRHA has introduced innovative health-care approaches for aboriginal patients.</p>
<p>But, he said, the WRHA needs to become more patient-centred, and there are concerns over how emergency care is delivered, said Postl, citing the upcoming inquest into the death of Brian Sinclair, who died while waiting to be seen in the emergency room at Health Sciences Centre.</p>
<p>Postl said the government has been supportive of the WRHA, and while he did not expect a new NDP premier would change that, "everyone's got a different perspective of priorities."</p>
<p>Tory health critic Myrna Driedger said Postl has been "a human shield" for government mistakes.</p>
<p>"Who's going to take the fall now for (Health Minister) Theresa Oswald's mistakes?" asked Driedger.</p>
<p>"I think he's had a daunting job. I think he deserves a lot of credit," said Driedger. "He had a lot of hurdles to climb, including political interference from the government."</p>
<p>Driedger said ER waiting times are still not acceptable, and said Manitoba lacks enough ICU and ER nurses to handle a flu pandemic this fall.</p>
<p>Postl disagreed.</p>
<p>"We knew H1N1 would be a big activity this fall. This province is better prepared than virtually any other province," Postl said.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the health authority said Postl, who earned $418,200 in 2008, will receive no severance package.</p>
<p>He said he may apply to be the dean of medicine at U of M, though there are also other undisclosed jobs he could consider pursuing.</p>
<p>"I haven't made any decisions -- clearly, that would be an opportunity," he said. "I'd be very surprised if I left Canada, and frankly, I'd be very surprised if I left Winnipeg."</p>
<p>University of Manitoba officials have said a standard search has been launched for a new dean of medicine to succeed Dr. Dean Sandham on July 1, 2010.</p>
<p>Sandham's contract expires next June 30, the same time that Postl will resign from the WRHA.</p>
<p>U of M says that the search will be conducted internationally.</p>
<p>nick.martin@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>In his own words</p>
<p>Dr. Brian Postl announced to staff Tuesday his plans to retire next year as president and CEO of the Winnipeg Region Health Authority:</p>
<p>"After almost 10 years as chief executive officer of the WRHA, I have informed Dr. John Wade, WRHA board chair, of my intention to retire June, 2010. I will continue to serve in this capacity until a successor has been named. A search and transition process will be underway in the near future.</p>
<p>"It has been an honour and privilege to work with such outstanding and committed health professionals throughout the WRHA. We can be proud of the many accomplishments in building a more integrated health system for Manitobans.</p>
<p>"We will continue to stay focused on the challenges we face including H1N1 in the next few months."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1: Saskatchewan is aware, but not scared of 'second wave'</b>
</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>473 words</div><div>9 September 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>It's already been declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), but most Saskatchewan residents are not lying awake at night in a cold sweat worrying about the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>A survey conducted by Sigma Analytics for the Leader-Post found only 24 per cent of respondents were concerned or very concerned about becoming sick with the virus, compared with 46 per cent who are not worried at all -- with the remaining 30 per cent having no strong opinion either way.</p>
<p>The numbers reflect the current scientific wisdom about H1N1 -- while the virus can kill, the vast majority of those who get it suffer only mild symptoms. In short, it can't be compared with previous devastating pandemics like the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed more than 50 million worldwide. Scientists point out that seasonal flu already kills 250,000 to 500,000 people worldwide each year (2,000 to 8,000 in Canada).</p>
<p>Measured against that yardstick, the H1N1 virus has had a very modest impact thus far. Since April, there have been 72 deaths in Canada and only four in Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there's room for complacency.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus could still mutate into something more threatening. And even if it doesn't, the WHO says 15-45 per cent of the population will get the virus when the "second wave" hits the northern hemisphere this fall.</p>
<p>While only a minority of those patients will be very sick, already stretched hospital intensive care units will be challenged to cope with the surge, with some people needing ventilators and extended hospital stays. There's also the issue of doctors, nurses and other health-care providers being unable to work if they, too, become sick, putting more pressure on the health system.</p>
<p>Though the Sigma survey shows that more than 80 per cent of the population is aware of the H1N1 pandemic, just 59 per cent are likely to get vaccinated. That's actually better than a Canadian Press Harris-Decima poll suggesting only 45 per cent of Canadians would get vaccinated. Some health workers are also cool to the idea -- a Nursing Times survey found only 33 per cent of frontline nurses were willing to be vaccinated. A similar number said they wouldn't get vaccinated while the rest were undecided.</p>
<p>Of course, the "undecideds", "not worrieds" and "don't knows" in all polls could soon change their minds about H1N1 if thousands become ill in the next few months.</p>
<p>For now, H1Nl is just like next winter's weather -- hard to predict. There really is no point in worrying about it.</p>

<p>$150K OFFERED TO CATCH ARSONIST</p>
<p>California and Los Angeles County are offering $150,000 for information leading to the arrest and conviction of an arsonist who started the Station fire, which has killed two and burned an area larger than Chicago.</p>
<p>Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger announced the state's $100,000 reward last week, and the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors added their own $50,000 incentive Tuesday.</p>
<p>Materials used to start or accelerate flames were found at the site where firefighters believe the blaze began, the Los Angeles Times reported, citing an unidentified person close to the investigation.</p>
<p>The 160,357-acre Station fire, which began on Aug. 26, has injured eight people and burned more than 140 structures. The U.S. Forest Service expects the fire, which was 56 per cent contained as of 3 p.m. local time today, to be under control by next Tuesday.</p>
<p>Two firefighters died Aug. 30 after their truck fell off a mountain road.</p>
<p>The fire's name comes from its point of origin near a ranger station at the entrance to the Angeles National Forest near the suburb of La Canada Flintridge.</p>
<p>PFIZER WINS SUIT OVER VIAGRA STUNT</p>
<p>NEW YORK - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that drugmaker <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>'s trademark had been infringed when a man towed a decommissioned missile around Manhattan emblazoned with the words "Viva Viagra," the slogan for <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span>'s blockbuster impotence drug.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> sued Arye Sachs after he parked the seven-metre-long decommissioned missile outside its headquarters in September 2008 in a stunt to promote his business selling outdoor advertising spots on retired military equipment.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Pauley ruled in favour of <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> for trademark infringement claims. "If defendants intended this to be funny, <span class="companylink">Pfizer</span> did not get the joke," he said.</p>
<p>MEXICO TO SLASH THREE MINISTRIES</p>
<p>MEXICO CITY 0 Mexican President Felipe Calderon on Tuesday proposed a tough austerity budget for the coming year, slashing spending by US$6 billion by eliminating three government ministries.</p>
<p>The draconian draft budget for 2010 would eliminate the country's tourism, agricultural reform and civil service ministries, Calderon said in a written statement.</p>
<p>"Three ministries ... will be phased out," said Calderon, who said the functions of the tourism ministry would be overtaken by Mexico's ministry for the economy.</p>
<p>The dossier of the agricultural reform ministry now will fall under the aegis of the social development department, while the civil service ministry will come under the president's office, the Mexican leader said.</p>
<p>Calderon also proposed spending cuts at Mexico's embassies overseas.</p>
<p>Hard hit by falling exports and the swine flu outbreak, Mexico's economy had its worst performance on record in the second quarter, according to central bank data released late last month.</p>
<p>SOUTH AMERICA</p>
<p>BRAZIL WEIGHS BATTISTI EXTRADITION</p>
<p>RIO DE JANEIRO - Brazil's Supreme Court will today start weighing an extradition demand for Cesare Battisti, a fugitive Italian ex-militant wanted in his homeland for murders committed more than three decades ago.</p>
<p>The case, which could drag on for days or months, has become a major point of friction between Rome and Brasilia ever since Brazil's justice minister in January granted political asylum to Battisti on grounds he risked persecution at home.</p>
<p>Italy considers Battisti a "terrorist."</p>
<p>It has convicted him in absentia to life imprisonment for the murders of four people in the 1970s carried out by the Armed Proletarians for Communism, a violent Marxist group to which he belonged.</p>
<p>Battisti denies participation in the murders, of a prison guard, a special investigator of terrorist groups, a butcher and a jeweler, attributed to the group.</p>
<p>After fleeing Italy's justice in 1981, he renounced his militant past and remade himself as a successful crime writer in France, where he lived in exile for 14 years.</p>
<p>When French laws protecting him and other repentant former foreign militants were changed, Battisti fled again, arriving in Rio de Janeiro in 2004 with fake identification documents.</p>
<p>He was arrested in Rio three years later at Italy's request and has been in detention since.</p>
<p>Italy has repeatedly sought to have Battisti's political asylum revoked, but was rebuffed by both Brazil's supreme court in February and by Brazil's attorney general in May. Italy's ambassador was briefly recalled from Brazil in a gesture of fury.</p>
<p>FREAK TORNADO KILLS 14</p>
<p>BUENOS AIRES A violent storm described as a freak "tornado" shredded hundreds of houses and killed at least 14 people in the southern part of South America on Tuesday, officials said.</p>
<p>Northern Argentina and southern Brazil, and the small countries of Uruguay and Paraguay wedged between them, were hit by a fierce atmospheric mass packing rain, hail and winds over 120 kilometers per hour.</p>
<p>In northeastern Argentina, 10 people died, including seven children, authorities said.</p>
<p>More than 50 others were injured, and trees and power lines were toppled in the towns of Santa Rosa, Tobuna and Pozo Azul, said Ricardo Veselka Corrales, head of the local civil defense office.</p>
<p>Witnesses and local media described the storm as a tornado.</p>
<p>Meteorologists were wary, although the U.S. National Climatic Data Center said the affected zone is the only place in South America with a likelihood of experiencing the high-speed spinning tubes of destructive wind.</p>
<p>"It could have been a tornado," said Jorge Leguizamon, of Argentina's National Meteorological Service.</p>
<p>"The phenomenon still hasn't been classified. Experts will have to evaluate the damage," he said.</p>
<p>What was clear was that "it's not normal for this area," said the provincial minister, Daniel Franco.</p>
<p>"We've always had very strong winds and torrential rains here. But this was a phenomenon never seen before. Houses were completely destroyed," he said.</p>
<p>EUROPE</p>
<p>NEWBORN BABY FOUND IN BUSHES</p>
<p>LONDON - A baby girl, thought to be just two days old and with the umbilical cord still attached, was found abandoned Tuesday in bushes in Britain, police said.</p>
<p>The newborn was discovered inside a canvas bag and wrapped in a cardigan by a woman walking past the area near a supermarket in High Wycombe in southeast England, police said.</p>
<p>The baby, named Rosie by medical staff, was "safe and well" after being taken to hospital, said police, who issued a plea for her mother to come forward.</p>
<p>"Our primary concern is for the health of Rosie's mother," said Det. Sgt. Robin Hughes.</p>
<p>"The umbilical cord was still attached when the child was found, so this would not have been a medically supervised birth."</p>
<p>TWO GUERRILLAS KILLED IN INGUSHETIA</p>
<p>MOSCOW - Two suspected guerrilla fighters were killed in Russia's increasingly volatile southern Ingushetia region, Russian news agencies reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>"One suspect was killed in the clash, the other tried to get away and seized a minivan with passengers, and opened fire when police moved to intercept him," a local security service official said as quoted by Interfax news agency.</p>
<p>"One bullet hit the grenade the criminal was holding and exploded it, killing him and injuring the van's passengers," whose number was not given, the official added.</p>
<p>Since June alone, at least 264 people have been killed in the regions of Chechnya, Dagestan and Ingushetia, according to an AFP tally based on official reports.</p>

<p>"He has accepted the challenge of our country and of the Liberal Party to become the standard bearer of our party in the 2010 election," chairman Franklin Drilon said on ABS-CBN television.</p>
<p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
<p>FOUR SOLDIERS, SIX COPS KILLED IN IRAQ</p>
<p>BAGHDAD - Four U.S. soldiers were killed in bomb blasts and northern Iraq and Baghdad on Tuesday, and six Iraqi policemen also died in attacks in the country's north.</p>
<p>It was the deadliest day for the Americans since June 29, when four soldiers were killed in Baghdad. The next day most U.S. troops pulled out of Iraq's cities, where their movements since have been restricted, although they have greater latitude in the countryside. Only seven American soldiers died in August.</p>
<p>In Tuesday's attacks, three U.S. soldiers were slain by a roadside bomb while on patrol in Salahuddin province north of the capital, according to the U.S. military. The fourth soldier died when an explosive device targeted his patrol in southern Baghdad.</p>
<p>Before the latest incidents, the U.S. Defense Department put the death toll in Iraq for its civilian employees and the American military at 4,340.</p>
<p>It was also a bloody day for the Iraqi security forces around the oil-rich Kirkuk region of northern Iraq, the territory at the centre of a land dispute among Kurds, Arabs and Turkmen. Two Iraqi policemen were killed and four wounded in a bomb blast on a road less than 20 miles from the city of Kirkuk.</p>
<p>A roadside bomb also claimed the life of Maj. Zaid Hussein, who headed a counter-terrorism police unit, and three of his men in the town of Armili.</p>
<p>YEMEN ARRESTS FOUR NEAR U.S. EMBASSY</p>
<p>SANAA - Four Yemenis carrying hand grenades and guns were arrested near the U.S. embassy in the Yemeni capital Sanaa, the Interior Ministry said on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A Ministry statement said the four, aged between 20 and 33, had hand grenades, automatic weapons and ammunition. It did not say when they were arrested.</p>
<p>The ministry said the four were residents of a town called Damaj in the northern province of Saada, where the government is battling a revolt by Shiite Muslims of the Zaydi sect.</p>
<p>The Arab world's poorest country is also battling a wave of al-Qaida attacks and rising secessionist sentiment in the south.</p>
<p>Twin suicide car bombings outside the U.S. embassy in Sanaa a year ago killed 16 people. Al-Qaida claimed responsibility.</p>
<p>International concern over Yemen has been heightened because instability there could endanger neighbours, including oil-rich Saudi Arabia.</p>

<p>Does better-safe-than-sorry apply more to joining the mass inoculation being planned against the H1N1 virus, or choosing not to because of dangers in doing so?</p>
<p>At latest report, 72 deaths have been attributed to this flu. A small number when compared with the little broadcast fact that influenza results in an average of 20,000 hospitalizations and 4,000 deaths each year, yet magnified each time a death occurs.</p>
<p>The federal government's purchase of $50.4 million doses of vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline Plc</span> is a concern. Glaxo has said its adjuvant has proven safe and effective in clinical trials with 39,000 people, the additive isn't yet approved in the U.S.</p>
<p>The federal government's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said clinical trials for the vaccine are still on track for early this fall. His aim is to ensure safety and effectiveness but these are always value judgments.</p>
<p>Unlike previous destructive experiences with governments‚ pandemic panic reactions, this time all potential dangers must be clearly laid before the public.</p>
<p>Advertising must be of the positive steps that can be taken in everyday living to avoid catching all influenzas and transmitting them to others, rather than scare tactics that have been used in the past.</p>
<p>Positive steps can be taken immediately in hospitals and schools to make alcohol-based sanitizer, gel or wipes, not only available, as has been done in hospitals but obligatory upon entering.</p>
<p>Which risk is the greater, catching this flu declared to be the equivalent of the Spanish flu or suffering debilitating effects from a hurriedly prepared vaccine said to contain dangerous ingredients?</p>
<p>Governments must be pressed to provide all data available so individuals can make informed decisions for themselves and their families.</p>
