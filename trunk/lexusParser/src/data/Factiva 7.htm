</div><div>Tamara Gignac   </div>

<p>T hree H1N1 clinics will remain open in Calgary next week as demand plummets for the flu vaccine.</p>
<p>About 25,000 people a day braved long lineups for the swine flu shot in November, when the province launched its mass immunization campaign.</p>
<p>But fewer Albertans are rolling up their sleeves, even though the H1N1 virus is still circulating and months remain in the winter flu season.</p>
<p>On Thursday, 311 doses of the H1N1 vaccine were given at the Calgary clinics.</p>
<p>"The numbers have dropped off dramatically," said Dr. Gerry Predy, senior medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services. "I think there's far less public concern and fear, in part because we now know a lot more about this virus. It didn't turn out to be as bad a pandemic as it could have."</p>
<p>The province plans to keep the clinics open for at least another week. Influenza is always a threat in the winter and officials say it's possible Albertans could still see another wave of H1N1 or an outbreak of a seasonal flu strain.</p>
<p>Both vaccines will be offereduntil Jan. 30, when health officials will evaluate whether to continue to make the shots available in mass clinics.</p>
<p>With three months of flu season still to go, anything is possible, Predy cautioned. A major event like the Olympics could lead to a spike in the contagious and unpredictable H1N1 virus, for instance.</p>
<p>"We have to remain vigilant from now until the end of April because it could come back any time," he said.</p>
<p>If the number of people who've sought the vaccine is any indication, Albertans are not worried. About 1.2 million people have received the H1N1 vaccine, leaving the province with a surplus of about 700,000 doses.</p>
<p>To date, 71 people in Alberta have died from H1N1 flu and about 1,300 have been hospitalized. Approximately half the Canadian population opted for the shot, which probably helped stem the spread of the illness, health officials say.</p>
<p>Experts are not ruling out the possibility of a third wave of swine flu, even though the threat of H1N1 appears to be on the decline.</p>
<p>"We're certainly going to see some significant influenza during the regular influenza season," said Winnipeg Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensive care specialist at the forefront of H1N1 research.</p>
<p>He said while the incidence of H1N1 flu is relatively low, flu tends to ramp up toward the end of this month and in February. Whether it will be the H1N1 virus that continues to dominate or not is uncertain, Kumar said.</p>
<p>H1N1 is widespread in North Africa, South Asia and areas of eastern Europe, according to a World Health Organization update issued Friday.</p>

<p>In his 2004 techno-thriller, State of Fear, Michael Crichton writes about a fictitious environmental group that hopes to use technology to create natural disasters during a major international eco-conference. Their plan is to increase public concern over global warming and, thus, donations to their organization.</p>
<p>The environmentalists plan to use: explosives to "calf" a giant iceberg in Antarctica; rockets and lightning attractors to generate a huge storm that will flood a desert national park in the U.S. southwest; and a giant seismic machine to set off an earthquake in the South Pacific that will trigger a tsunami that will hit Los Angeles -- site of the conference -- on the gathering's last day.</p>
<p>When I read the novel, I had to shake my head at the proposed plots, especially at the possibility of environmentalists trying to convince the media and the public that somehow a tsunami -- a geological event, not a climatic one -- was the result of global warming. As gullible as many people can be about climate change, I was certain not even the naive would buy the idea that the earthquake that generated Crichton's tidal wave could be blamed on global warming.</p>
<p>I didn't have long to wait to be proved wrong.</p>
<p>Later that year, the Boxing Day tsunamis -- triggered by a 9.0-plus magnitude earthquake off the coast of Indonesia -- killed at least 230,000 people.</p>
<p>In a move that stretched credibility to the breaking point, some environmentalists tried to score points for their climate-disaster theory by blaming the deadly waves on global warming. Most insisted later that they had merely meant that the destruction had</p>
<p>been made worse because global warming had killed off protective forests and marshes along the shorelines of the 14 countries affected. But at least initially, a few got so caught up in their belief that man-made warming was threatening the planet that they claimed the tsunamis were caused by carbon emissions before thinking through whether that was even possible.</p>
<p>Now it has happened again. Last week, actor and environmental activist Danny Glover told GRITtv, an online, satellite and cable show, that global warming caused the Haiti earthquake.</p>
<p>"I hope we seize this particular moment because the threat of what happened to Haiti is the threat that could happen anywhere in the Caribbean to these island nations, you know. They're all in peril because of global warming, they're all in peril because of climate change."</p>
<p>Glover insisted the earthquake was the result of world leaders' failure to develop a new carbon-emissions treaty last month at the UN's Earth summit.</p>
<p>"When we look back at what we did at the climate summit in Copenhagen, this is the response, this is what happens . . . we have to act now."</p>
<p>All last week there was coverage (and rightly so) of absolutely asinine remarks by televangelist Pat Robertson about the unearthly origins of the Haiti disaster.</p>
<p>Two centuries ago, according to Robertson, Haitians wanted to be free of their French colonial masters.</p>
<p>"They were under the heel of the French," Robertson told his 700 Club television audience. "And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said, we will serve you if you'll get us free from the French."</p>
<p>Geez, as bad as the French might have been to live under, I'm pretty sure it would have been obvious, even to a nation of illiterate, 19th-century slaves that life under Satan or Beelzebub or Lucifer would have been worse.</p>
<p>But it's the practicality of Robertson's claim that makes his assertion particularly ludicrous: How would you get a whole people together to swear out the oath without anyone noticing? Even if it were just a gathering of a substantial number of Haiti's rebels who came together to make this satanic pact, someone would have taken notice. There would be more evidence than Pat's say-so alone.</p>
<p>Both Glover and Robertson deserve equal condemnation for making preposterous connections between the devastation in Haiti and their causes and extreme beliefs.</p>
<p>What the horror and tragedy in Haiti should show us all is just how lucky we are -- just how trivial our complaints are at their cores.</p>
<p>How important are carbon footprints compared to perhaps as many as 140,000 dead? Calls for tax cuts and balanced budgets seem trivial next to reports of bodies in the streets being so numerous they cannot be claimed or buried or even carted off, so are burned where they lie to prevent disease. Debates over monies spent on H1N1 vaccines or over prorogation -- as obnoxious a move as it may be -- seem almost silly when there is no water, no power, no sanitation, no doctors or medicines and no food, and the stench of death and decay is so pervasive that some aid workers who have arrived since the quake claim to have wretched upon landing.</p>
<p>Most of our disagreements are petty by comparison. Be generous. Help Haiti.</p>

</p>
<p>Manitoba first nations residents were disproportionately hit with severe H1N1 infection during the first wave of the virus last spring, a team of researchers has found.</p>
<p>University of Manitoba researchers, led by Dr. Ryan Zarychanski, examined 795 cases of H1N1 in the province from the time the outbreak started last April until Sept. 5, 2009.</p>
<p>Sixty per cent of the 45 severe cases -- defined as those requiring admittance to an intensive-care unit -- were from first nations communities.</p>
<p>The study, published this week in the online edition of the Canadian Medical Association Journal, also found the likelihood of severe infection was related to delays in receiving antiviral treatment.</p>
<p>The severity of H1N1 cases grew with the average time between onset of symptoms in confirmed cases and the start of antiviral treatment: two days for cases handled in the community, four days for cases requiring hospitalization, and six days for the most severe cases, those admitted to an intensive-care unit.</p>
<p>First nations people represented 28 per cent of community cases, 54 per cent of hospitalization cases and 60 per cent of ICU cases, suggesting a genetic predisposition.</p>
<p>"This finding is consistent with historical records from the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic, during which mortality in aboriginal communities was far higher than in non-Aboriginal communities," the study notes.</p>
<p>Other factors such as housing, inadequate income, diet, underlying conditions or access to health care resources could play a role in the first nation finding, the study states.</p>
<p>It also drew a parallel between first nations populations and Aboriginals in Australia and New Zealand, who were also both overrepresented by severe H1N1 infections last year and during the Spanish influenza -- a finding attributed to social conditions.</p>
<p>"Intriguing as this hypothesis may be, Canadian Aboriginal people and Australian Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders do not share a common ancestry," the report read.</p>

</p>
<p>Professor of political science at the University of Calgary and a former federal Conservative campaign manager</p>
<p>You get one time around, one roll of the dice, one walk through the garden, one quick look at life.</p>
<p>– Michelle Wright</p>
<p>The words of Michelle Wright's love song apply to the unique pattern of Alberta politics. No political party in the province, once turned out of office, has ever come back for a second time around. The Liberals won the first election in 1905 and governed until defeated by the <span class="companylink">United Farmers of Alberta</span> in 1921. Then Social Credit defeated the United Farmers in 1935. The Progressive Conservatives, who had completely disappeared before being reborn under Peter Lougheed, defeated Social Credit in 1971. And that's all she wrote – at least until recently, when it's started to look as if the Conservatives may be replaced by the upstart Wildrose Alliance Party.</p>
<p>There has never been alternation in office in Alberta, unlike in several other provinces where the Liberals and Conservatives take turns governing. In Alberta, one party governs for a long stretch (36 years for Social Credit, 39 and counting for the Conservatives), then is obliterated by a new party without governing experience.</p>
<p>Explaining this unusual pattern is a cottage industry in Canadian political science. The redoubtable C. B. Macpherson propounded a Marxist theory, but it didn't work because it failed to explain the differences between Alberta and Saskatchewan. My view is that Alberta's singularity is best explained through reference to settlement patterns and political culture, combined with historical accident and path dependency (political science jargon meaning that “one thing leads to another”).</p>
<p>ALBERTA'S AMERICAN INFLUENCE</p>
<p>From the very first settlement, Alberta has been unique in the extent of American influence, especially in the southern part of the province. The early white settlers were ranchers from Montana. Their numbers were later augmented by Mormon farmers and still later by oil-industry workers from across the western states, an influence that continues to this day.</p>
<p>These American immigrants were numerous enough to create a political culture with no particular reverence for the standard Canadian political brands – Liberal and Conservative – inherited from Britain. On the dry and windy plains of southern Alberta, few cared about Gilbert and Sullivan's theory: That every boy and every gal/ That's born into the world alive/ Is either a little Liberal/ Or else a little Conservative!</p>
<p>The strong American influence in southern Alberta furnished ideal soil for the growth of new political options, neither Liberal nor Conservative: Progressivism, whose Alberta provincial wing was the United Farmers; the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, founded in Calgary in 1932 as an outgrowth of Progressivism; Alberta Social Credit, established by the Calgary radio evangelist William Aberhart; the various parties of Alberta separatism; Preston Manning's Reform Party of Canada; Mel Hurtig's National Party; the Wildrose Alliance. And that is by no means a complete list.</p>
<p>There was a moment when Alberta almost broke with its past to adopt the more common Canadian norm of Liberal-Conservative competition. That was in the early 1990s, when Don Getty's Conservatives got into deep trouble over spiralling budget deficits. Liberal leader Laurence Decore, a former mayor of Edmonton, repositioned his party to the right of Mr. Getty's Conservatives, promising brutal budget cuts to banish the deficit.</p>
<p>Mr. Decore and the Liberals would have won the 1993 election, had the Conservatives not dumped Mr. Getty and chosen former Calgary mayor Ralph Klein to lead them. As it was, the election was close, and it seemed that a new era of Conservative-Liberal competition had arrived. But the Liberals, disappointed at not winning, forced out Mr. Decore. He was followed by a series of Liberal leaders with no idea of how to win.</p>
<p>Today, the Liberals are a niche party in Alberta. They can get 20 per cent to 25 per cent of the vote, but they're not seen as an alternative government. The New Democrats also aren't going to win in this politically conservative province. Ergo, when voters are unhappy with the government, they seek a new alternative.</p>
<p>WHY WILDROSE? WHY NOW?</p>
<p>Actually, the Wildrose Alliance is not entirely new; it has existed in one form or another since 2002. Until recently, it was a further-right niche party, afflicted with the factionalism that so often plagues small parties with no chance of winning. But, suddenly, Wildrose is polling at 39 per cent, compared with 25 per cent for the Conservatives and 24 per cent for the Liberals. Only in Alberta could a party climb so quickly to the top of the polls.</p>
<p>Why now? One explanation is that Wildrose Leader Danielle Smith is photogenic and articulate, and has mainstream appeal (full disclosure: she is also my former student, but that's not where she got her good qualities). Even more important is the mess that Premier Ed Stelmach has made.</p>
<p>Mr. Stelmach likes to say, and it's true, that he has never lost a campaign. He shrewdly figured out how to make the complicated rules of the Conservative leadership race work for him, then went on to win a huge victory in the 2008 general election.</p>
<p>But his performance in government has not matched his campaign achievements: appointing a first cabinet that underrepresented the cities, especially Calgary; awarding MLAs and cabinet ministers a huge salary increase in a secret vote the day before the legislature closed; passing a small reduction while putting out a misleading press release to make the cut seem larger (it worked for only a day); destroying the fabled Alberta Advantage by tearing up contracts and raising royalties, thereby driving oil and gas companies to spend their land-acquisition and drilling budgets elsewhere; trying to pick business winners with government investments, thus reversing another of Ralph Klein's wise policies; merging local health districts into one provincial organization, ostensibly to reduce deficits but actually increasing them; rolling out swine-flu vaccinations without setting priorities, thus leading healthy young men to trample women and children on their way to the needle; failing to curb runaway government spending that had begun in Mr. Klein's latter years. The list goes on and on and on …</p>
<p>STELMACH FIGHTS BACK</p>
<p>In a recent national poll, Mr. Stelmach received the lowest ranking of all premiers: Only 14 per cent of Alberta respondents viewed him favourably. The public's assessment of his performance has driven a series of highly visible Tory reverses: losing the previously safe riding of Calgary-Glenmore to Wildrose in a by-election; falling precipitously in the polls; and two caucus members crossing the floor to join Wildrose.</p>
<p>Mr. Stelmach and his advisers have come up with a three-step plan to stanch the bleeding. The first was the cabinet shuffle announced last week. The second is a “competitiveness review” to repair the oil and gas royalty structure, although so many patches have already been applied that the perception of instability has become as big a problem as the original revenue grab. The third is the 2010-11 budget, to be brought down in February and rumoured to contain about $2-billion in expenditure cuts, in the hope of setting the province on the path toward balanced budgets.</p>
<p>It's not a bad plan, due largely to political pressure from Wildrose (the prospect of hanging concentrates the mind). But it's an open question whether it will work. It has to be well executed, and this government has not executed very well since taking office. And Mr. Stelmach may simply have lost too much esteem in public opinion to recover.</p>
<p>If the winter recovery plan doesn't work, look for bloody civil war on the right. Wildrose has a leader who performs well in public. She lacks management experience, but she's acquiring that in building her party. Wildrose can probably raise the money it needs, and is rapidly building an organization to challenge the Tories.</p>
<p>Unlike what happened at the federal level, the “fight on the right” will not allow the Liberals to win; they will probably stay confined to their 20-per-cent to 25-per-cent niche, where they wait patiently for patronage when and if their federal cousins return to power. But it could produce a minority legislature, with all the instability that implies.</p>
<p>In a utopian fantasy world, none of this would have to happen. Almost all Wildrose supporters used to vote Conservative. Most Conservatives have no quarrel with Wildrose principles (New Minister of Finance and Enterprise Ted Morton said recently that he's in 90-per-cent agreement with Wildrose). There is, at least for now, far less philosophical disagreement between Alberta Conservatives and Wildrose than existed between the federal Progressive Conservatives and the Canadian Alliance before those two parties engineered their merger.</p>
<p>Conceivably, the Tories could make peace with Wildrose, merging the organizations and holding a new leadership contest. But the Tories affirmed Mr. Stelmach's leadership at last fall's provincial convention, so now what? In the looming battle, the Conservatives have all the advantages of money, personnel, experience and incumbency. But maybe their time is up. Ask Michelle Wright.</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>LONG LIVE THE KINGS</p>
<p>If the Wildrose Alliance Party were to knock off the Progressive Conservatives and form Alberta's next government, it would join a venerable list of dynasties:</p>
<p>PETER LOUGHEED & THE CONSERVATIVES</p>
<p>A lawyer and former Canadian Football League halfback who turned to politics, he rejuvenated the provincial Conservatives and overturned incumbent Harry Strom in 1971, winning 49 of 75 seats in the legislature and ending Social Credit's 36-year grip on power. Mr. Lougheed's party remains in power today, led by Premier Ed Stelmach.</p>
<p>WILLIAM ABERHART & SOCIAL CREDIT</p>
<p>The world's first Social Credit government was headed by the man nicknamed Bible Bill, a religious teacher and radio evangelist who became interested in the theory that private control of credit would lead to a chronic shortage of mass purchasing power. His movement won a surprise landslide victory in 1935, winning 56 of 63 seats and remaining in power until 1971, winning nine majorities.</p>
<p>HERBERT GREENFIELD & ThE UFA</p>
<p>An immigrant from England who established a homestead north of Edmonton, he became involved in politics but was not a candidate when the <span class="companylink">United Farmers of Alberta</span> unexpectedly beat the governing Liberals, taking 38 of 61 seats in the 1921 election. The party's vice-president was selected as premier and later won a seat in the legislature. The movement, founded as an agricultural lobbying organization, governed until 1935 and now exists as a supply co-operative.</p>
<p>ALEXANDER RUTHERFORD & THE LIBERALS</p>
<p>Alberta's first premier was practising as a lawyer in Edmonton when the province was carved from the Northwest Territories in 1905. His Liberals won 23 of 25 seats in the first legislative election and governed until 1921.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>This little (Creole) piggy once stood for Haitian pride; That fact should be top of mind as leaders gather in Montreal this week to plan country's rebuilding</b>
</div><div>Kenneth Kidd   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1055 words</div><div>23 January 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>IN01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The Creole pig had a few things going for it.</p>
<p>It was geared to Haiti's rugged terrain, for starters, got by on the land's sparse vegetation and didn't especially need clean drinking water. To put an economic gloss on the beast, it could seek out its own inputs.</p>
<p>Just about every rural family in Haiti had one, a four-legged bank that had a natural way of reproducing itself, could be sold off if money was needed for an emergency, and was ultimately edible.</p>
<p>As world leaders gather in Montreal on Monday to start developing reconstruction plans for Haiti, they could do worse than ponder the plight of the Creole pig, a cautionary tale among many to have befallen the now-impoverished and earthquake-shattered nation.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s and early 1980s, amid the swine flu hysteria, the United States pressured Haitian dictator Jean-Claude "Baby Doc" Duvalier into slaughtering virtually all of the Creole pigs, lest they help spark an epidemic of the virus.</p>
<p>The indigenous breed was replaced by imported U.S. pigs, which proved so unsuitable to island life that they more or less promptly expired. Haitians dubbed the newcomers princes on four legs, given their dependence on clean water, regular vaccinations and imported feed.</p>
<p>The whole episode, notes University of Toronto historian Melanie Newton, "proceeded from the assumption that Haitians don't know what they're doing, don't have any understanding of agriculture and their practices are somehow a danger to the west."</p>
<p>Little wonder that Haitians have such enduring suspicion of foreign interventions; the results have nearly always been in everyone's interests save those of Haitians.</p>
<p>Nor is this merely a modern phenomenon, which is why Newton believes reversing that record, and its assumptions, is so key to fashioning reconstruction plans next week.</p>
<p>Haiti may lay claim to the only successful slave rebellion when locals overthrew the French in 1804, but the price was steep. France refused to recognize its former colony and allow it to trade unless Haiti agreed to pay 20 million gold francs.</p>
<p>Including interest, that amount works out to roughly $25 billion (U.S.) in today's currency, a debt it took Haiti until 1922 to pay off.</p>
<p>"Haiti was a pariah," says Newton. "It was like the Cuba of the 19th century, except that Cuba had the Soviet Union. Haiti had no one."</p>
<p>By the time the debt was repaid, Haiti was well into a 19-year occupation by the United States, which had another lasting effect.</p>
<p>In what had been a predominantly agricultural economy, economic and political power became centred in Port-au-Prince, a shift that only accelerated under the ensuing dictatorships of the Duvaliers, pere et fils.</p>
<p>Astonishingly, a country that started as a colony of rural slaves is now a net importer of food, much of it heavily subsidized surplus food from the United States, including rice, against which local farmers can't possibly compete.</p>
<p>"The big thing is to get their agriculture back on track, so that there's a better degree of self-sufficiency," notes Peter Stoett, a professor of political science at Montreal's Concordia University."</p>
<p>"The worst-case scenario is probably business as usual, which is, part of an island which has been subject to serious governance crises, and an island in which social inequality is more or less the defining political culture."</p>
<p>By some estimates, more than half the country's resources are controlled by just 1 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>"There's still this pattern there of protecting this extremely small and exclusive economic elite," says Stoett.</p>
<p>Haiti's political leadership obviously has to shoulder much of the blame for continuing this pattern. But Newton argues that western demands, particularly the sort of structural reforms favoured by the International Monetary Fund, have always made an alternative course problematic.</p>
<p>IMF-style prescriptions, imposed as conditions for financial aid, typically call on developing countries to emphasize exports, often by devaluing the local currency, sell off state enterprises, freeze or reduce the role of government, and impose value-added taxes that are inherently regressive.</p>
<p>You end up with a leader like Jean-Bertrand Aristide, elected in 1990 on a platform that included boosts to health care and education, effectively having to abandon those state-expanding goals in return for Western support.</p>
<p>"If that popular will is never going to be supported by the donor countries that call the shots, then there will never be a government that is willing to respond to its own people," says Newton.</p>
<p>"If you're always beholden to outside sources, what's in it for you to listen to that popular will?"</p>
<p>When reconstruction plans begin in earnest Monday, billons of dollars in potential aid will be on the table.</p>
<p>The danger, says Michele Wucker, executive director of the World Policy Institute in New York, is that talks could get mired in an ideological debate over the role of the private sector and the state in Haiti's future.</p>
<p>"You need both," says Wucker. "You need an engaged private sector, a strong state, and you need accountability for both."</p>
<p>"In the best-case scenario, the rebuilding process is done in such a way that Haitian civil society is engaged, that there's a way for communities to communicate what their priorities are."</p>
<p>And whatever the eventual details of that reconstruction, attaining one legacy may well be crucial.</p>
<p>"The focus (should be) on collaboration and building the capacity of the Haitian government, so that, at the end of the process, we have some institutions that can withstand changes of government at the top."</p>

<p>In recent media reports, Saskatchewan farmers are being targeted for allegedly having mixed genetically modified (GM) flax with other varieties that are being exported to Europe. One term that stands out in the reports is the word "contamination". Why does our society show such little respect for the scientists and biologists who work hard at developing better food and plants for our overcrowded planet? The same people who are instilling fear against genetic engineering have instilled populations with the fear of global warming, nuclear power, the H1N1 immunization serum and a host of other scientific achievements.</p>
<p>These people are quick to discount anything they don't understand. Rather than research the topic and discover how it all works, they condemn the innovation.</p>
<p>Does anyone really believe that Europeans have not, or will not be, engaged in the development of genetically modified crops?</p>
<p>While they publicly condemn North America's GM crops, they are subliminally developing their own varieties that they will hold patents to in the future. And where will that leave western Canadian farmers? Holding an empty sack while Europe's farmers flourish. The more things change, the more they stay the same.</p>

</div><div>Sonja Puzic   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>594 words</div><div>23 January 2010</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The local health unit is worried that timely detection of infectious diseases and outbreaks in the community could be in jeopardy with the closure of Windsor's public health laboratory by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann says he's concerned about the impact the closure will have on the turnover of lab tests for illnesses such as tuberculosis and influenza, as well as bacteria and viruses responsible for other respiratory and gastrointestinal outbreaks. The closest public health lab is in London.</p>
<p>"This, of course, is of great concern to us and the laboratory staff," Heimann said after delivering the bad news to the health unit board Thursday.</p>
<p>The laboratory on Huron Church Road will close sometime by December, when the facility has to be vacated because it stands in the way of construction of the Windsor-Essex Parkway leading to the new border crossing. Heimann said he was surprised to hear that the building won't be simply relocated elsewhere.</p>
<p>The province's 12 public health labs collectively perform about four million tests annually. Tens of thousands of them are done in Windsor.</p>
<p>"The red flags are all over the place here," said board member and city councillor Bill Marra, who said the health unit and the community should fight to keep the lab services here.</p>
<p>But Dr. Vivek Goel, president and CEO of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, which runs the public health labs, said services won't be affected.</p>
<p>"In modern lab medicine, tests move across the country all the time," he said in an interview Friday. Thanks to modern technology, Ontario's labs produce quick results no matter where the specimen came from, Goel said, adding that about a quarter of specimens received by the Windsor lab are sent elsewhere for testing.</p>
<p>"Even though we may add a few hours of transport ... we're actually looking at improving turnaround times," he said. "There are many communities that are further from a lab than Windsor is from London.</p>
<p>"In fact, during H1N1 (outbreak), testing was moved right across the province ... our clients don't actually know if the testing is done down the street or in Thunder Bay."</p>
<p>Goel said the OAHPP is in the process of modernizing the public laboratory system and consolidating services, which may include other lab closures or downsizing.</p>
<p>"Ideally, the Windsor decision would have been made in the context of what's happening across the province, but ... it's been precipitated by the construction of the highway," he said.</p>
<p>Marra thinks city and county councils should offer some possible solutions to keep the provincial lab services in Windsor.</p>
<p>Marra said the planned construction of Windsor's new jail on Concession 8 just north of Highway 401 offers a "great opportunity" to establish a provincial government campus in the area that could house other services, including a public health lab.</p>
<p>Goel said 19 people currently work in the Windsor lab. Some of them may have an opportunity to move to other sites, such as London or Hamilton, but the arrangements have to be worked out through the collective agreement with the union, he said.</p>
<p>Heimann said he'll be meeting with the OAHPP soon to discuss the issue and get more details.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Visually impaired skier from Canada set to make history</b>
</div><div>By Michael Tutton   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>

</p>
<p>A contingent of 15 athletes will be named to Canada's Olympic cross-country ski team today, with visually impaired racer Brian McKeever almost certain to make history and be among them.</p>
<p>Robin McKeever, who has skied with his brother in two previous Paralympic Winter Games as a guide, says it's an accomplishment his sibling began to imagine two years ago.</p>
<p>"It was his main goal," he said in an interview from Canmore, Alta, where the brothers live and often train together. "He tried to not to think of it that way, but he put quite a bit of pressure on himself.</p>
<p>"It's just a relief now."</p>
<p>Brian McKeever wasn't commenting prior to the official event, but a release sent out by Cross Country Canada this week all but confirmed his nomination in saying the team, "will include the world's first winter-sport athlete who will compete in the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games in the same year."</p>
<p>As a Paralympian, the tall, wiry skier is a world leader. At the 2006 Paralympics in Turin, he won one quarter of the medals, including two gold, a silver and a bronze.</p>
<p>McKeever took a key step toward the Vancouver Games in late December, when the 30-year-old won the 50-kilometre race at the Olympic qualifiers.</p>
<p>That sets him up to compete in the mass start 50-kilometre race in the Callaghan Valley at the Winter Games - a race still considered to be a marquee event of the endurance sports in the Games.</p>
<p>When competing as a Paralympian, McKeever uses Robin as a guide. But in able-bodied competitions, he's on his own.</p>
<p>McKeever has Stargardt's disease, an inherited condition of macular degeneration. His vision is less than 10 per cent and all of it is peripheral.</p>
<p>He's described it as "seeing the doughnut, but not the Timbit."</p>
<p>Robin says that his brother's accomplishment is creating a new role model for young athletes with similar conditions.</p>
<p>"It encourages some other athletes with visual impairments to come out and push harder and strive for more," he said. "I already know of . . . one little boy who sees Brian as his hero because he has a sight disability as well."</p>
<p>The skier's potential to make the Olympics started to emerge in 2007, when he competed in the 50-kilometre world championships in Japan, placing 24th - the best Canadian in the race.</p>
<p>Since then, there have been some struggles.</p>
<p>He suffered a broken shoulder and a fractured rib last year. Early this winter his training was delayed by a nasty bout of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Despite the broken bones and congested lungs, McKeever bounced back over the winter, and showed himself to be among the best endurance skiers in the country.</p>
<p>David Wood, the head coach of the Canadian team, says McKeever is simply seen as another member of the team - gunning for good results. "It's nice to see him succeed because it's tougher for him," said Wood. "But he put his nose on the grindstone and he kept it there."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>$500,000 less for Public Health; Expect 3% budget increase -- at most -- to fund mandatory programs in 2010, province tells city</b>
</div><div>Neco Cockburn   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen; With files from Pauline Tam</div>

</p>
<p>Ottawa councillors heading into budget discussions next week are facing another "half-million-dollar pressure" after the Ontario government told city public health officials to cut their funding expectations, according to the chairwoman of the community and protective services committee.</p>
<p>Last year, the province gave Ottawa Public Health a five-per-cent increase to its budget for mandatory programs, but has told the health unit to plan for a maximum increase of three per cent in 2010. That cuts the funding expectation for the programs from about $1.25 million to $750,000, according to city officials, for a $500,000 difference.</p>
<p>Councillor Diane Deans, who chairs the community and protective services committee, said the decreased funding is another pressure for councillors who are already trying to figure out what to do with highly controversial proposals such as cuts to bus service.</p>
<p>Officials projected getting the same funding increase as last year, but in a letter dated Dec. 24, they were told that public health units should plan for "a maximum of up to three-per-cent increase for mandatory programs."</p>
<p>"As you know, the province is continuing to experience tight fiscal constraints with the consequence that the increase that have (sic) been available in recent years are unlikely to continue," states the letter from the Ministry of Health Promotion.</p>
<p>Deans called the cut "an unwelcome piece of news on Christmas Eve." She said, "There is a number of areas in the budget where there is some risk because we make assumptions based on past practice or best guess."</p>
<p>A city spokesman said the health unit "is reviewing this information to determine what it means for the upcoming fiscal year."</p>
<p>The funding shortfall would be more than the $400,000 that would be gained if another controversial proposal -- to slash Crime Prevention Ottawa -- goes through.</p>
<p>Next week, councillors will deal with the 2010 budget, which contains a 3.9-per-cent tax increase. At least two days are set aside for public delegations, with deliberations to follow.</p>
<p>The health unit is not the only institution facing funding shortfalls.</p>
<p>The Citizen has reported that Ottawa-area hospitals are facing at least $51.6 million in cuts to balance their budgets. That, the Citizen learned, has some contemplating closing beds and laying off staff unless the province comes forward with more funding.</p>
<p>The cuts, if they happen, would represent about two per cent on total budgets of $1.8 billion among the city's six hospitals, and the shortfall could grow if the province imposes a funding freeze next year. Some have already warned staff about potential job losses.</p>
<p>Ontario has a $24.7-billion deficit and plunging tax revenues. Under this fiscal situation, the best the hospitals could hope for is a two-per-cent funding increase, which would force less-severe cuts. But some analysts maintain a freeze is inevitable.</p>
<p>"The hospitals that are being prudent and those that are looking at no (funding) increases are being very realistic," University of Ottawa health economist Doug Angus told the Citizen. "I think if they get anything above a zero-per-cent increase, it's just going to be a bonus."</p>
<p>Queen's Park is not expected to tell hospitals exactly how much they will receive until May or June, well into the start of the new fiscal year, which starts April 1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Twit-storm' of rumours hinder Haiti relief efforts; Social networking technology lacks traditional fact-checking</b>
</div><div>Misty Harris   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>633 words</div><div>22 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>In what's being called a "Twit-storm of misinformation," social-media websites have become hotbeds of rumours, hoaxes and half-truths about Haiti over the past week.</p>
<p>Although Twitter, <span class="companylink">Facebook</span>, instant messaging and texting have all played positive roles in the earthquake's aftermath -- enabling everything from rescue efforts to fundraising campaigns -- so, too, have the technologies added noise to a crisis whose din was already overwhelming.</p>
<p>"If information is getting out there very, very quickly, it's not being fact-checked or vetted in the same way it is with traditional media," says David Dunne, a business professor at the University of Toronto. "But there are people out there who want information fast and are prepared to trade off some accuracy for that."</p>
<p>Advertising Age recently described the post-earthquake digital landscape as a "Twit-storm of misinformation," with much of it related to relief efforts.</p>
<p>Shortly after courier UPS announced its donation of $1 million in cash and in-kind donations, for example, the Tweets began to fly that the company was also providing free shipping to Haiti for packages weighing as much as 50 pounds. UPS has spent the better part of the last week trying to set the record straight.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, the question goes from 'What are you doing (to help)?' to 'What aren't you doing?'" says UPS spokeswoman Ronna Branch, who describes the new demands of public relations as "having relationships with reporters but also being able to blog and tweet and be on <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> and listen to the nightly news -- pretty much never sleep."</p>
<p><span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> faced a similar image problem last week when stories began circulating that they were flying doctors and nurses to Haiti for free -- a tall tale that arguably overshadowed the airline's bona-fide relief efforts.</p>
<p>Dunne said that companies can hire all the social media gurus in the world and still be incapable of setting the flight pattern for information.</p>
<p>"It's the world that owns your brand now, and the best you can do is try to influence their dialogue," says Dunne. "The problem is that people aren't as critical as they think they are about information on the Internet."</p>
<p>During last year's protests in Iran, online falsities and half-truths were rampant, and a harbinger of what we would see on social media sites at the height of the H1N1 pandemic: "Don't eat pork from Mexico!" or "This is germ warfare!"</p>
<p>A recent study in the Journal of Communication revealed that although people know they should analyze information critically, they rarely feel they have the time or energy to do so. They instead rely on trusted individuals, websites or brands -- dubbed credibility "shortcuts" -- to filter the news.</p>
<p>The strength of social media, however, is that people are no longer passive recipients of news; they're participants, enthusiasts and even citizen watchdogs sharing in a dynamic conversation open to everyone.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a study funded by the non-partisan Pew Research Center revealed this month that, despite the proliferation of online news-sharing sources, the overwhelming majority of original reporting still comes from traditional media, with social media acting more like "an alert system."</p>
<p>With this in mind, a digital news pioneer based in Vancouver says the future of journalism must be in the leveraging of online conversations, with reporters seeking to "raise the level of discussion."</p>
<p>"The role of the gatekeeper has been eroded by new media," says Alfred Hermida, a professor of journalism at the University of British Columbia. "So the professional journalist becomes an authenticator, a verifier, someone who tries to make sense of events, and someone who adds context and explanation."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Healthy immune system may start with mould-proofing</b>
</div><div>Mag Ruffman  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>555 words</div><div>22 January 2010</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>G05</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Why do some people always seem to get virus-related illnesses like colds and flu, while others sail through winter in perfect health?</p>
<p>According to Dr. Murray Grossan, author of Free Yourself From Sinus And Allergy Problems Permanently, people most at risk for contracting flu are young children and older individuals who are in poor health.</p>
<p>"But people of any age with a compromised immune system can get it ... especially those with respiratory or sinus problems," writes Grossan.</p>
<p>OK, what causes respiratory and sinus problems in "people of any age?"</p>
<p>According to a 1994 Harvard study, 50 per cent of North American households have indoor mould, mildew and moisture problems associated with a 50 per cent to 100 per cent increase in respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>And a 1999 Mayo Clinic study linked nearly all chronic sinus infections to moulds. Recent studies also link moulds to the tripling of the asthma rate in the past 20 years.</p>
<p>Why is mould so unhealthy? Dr. Alex Delgado, member of the American Academy of Environmental Medicine, says, "Mould acts as a penetrating agent to the body system ... thereby allowing opportunistic diseases to flourish."</p>
<p>So what can you do to safeguard your family's health in this flu and cold season?</p>
<p>You want to control any of the following trouble spots first:</p>
<p>1. Plumbing leaks that need repair</p>
<p>2. Visible condensation buildup around windows and walls</p>
<p>3. Visible water seeping into the basement</p>
<p>4. Roof and attic leaks</p>
<p>Here are other tips:</p>
<p>* To control existing mould populations, get a hygrometer (about $20) and maintain indoor relative humidity between 30 and 45 per cent, using dehumidifiers as required.</p>
<p>Because newer houses are airtight and trap moisture, they require constant dehumidification according to the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation.</p>
<p>Viruses are small. For example, the diameter of a human hair is about 100 microns. The H1N1 virus measures one tenth of one micron across.</p>
<p>Fortunately, viruses travel on much larger particles from sneezes or coughs. And these can be strained from your indoor air with a high-quality furnace filter.</p>
<p>* Ventilate, especially in bathrooms, to reduce humidity. Install fans or open the doors and windows whenever possible. Indoor mould spore counts are typically higher than outdoor counts.</p>
<p>Mould and mildew smell badly, so do a nose check in your basement, attic, kitchen and bathrooms, especially under cupboards and around foundation walls.</p>
<p>And if there's a pong the first time you turn on your forced-air furnace each winter, you may have mould and mildew residing in your ducts. We sure did.</p>
<p>* Have your ducts professionally cleaned and treated with anti-mould spray. We had ours cleaned and our home no longer smells foul.</p>
<p>Summer condensation inside the ducts had caused mould growth in the construction debris caught in the ducts. Hence every time we turned the furnace on, we started sneezing and coughing.</p>
<p>* Instead of bleach to treat mould, use a nontoxic earth-friendly spray approved by Health Canada. I use Concrobium Mold Control (about $10 at hardware stores). It kills mould with a fungicidal film that stops regrowth.</p>

<p>Congratulations if you've made it this far: Welcome to 2010. You survived the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, bankbailouts, subprimemisery, credit crunches, Bernie Madoff and swine flu. And bombs-in-briefs. Time to put the worst of the wreckage behind us and begin a new round of retirement planning. Fortunately, investment advice abounds:</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One unfortunate fallout from the economic crisis is that it has tended to obscure the merits of the tax-free savings account (TFSA). The Canadian Investment Guide 2010 quotes an RBC poll from October 2009 that found 71% of Canadian adults were aware of this tax-sheltered savings vehicle, but only 24% had actually opened an account.</p>
<p>Most cited lack of understanding of TFSAs and lack of money for not doing so.</p>
<p>Experts believe this is soon to change, and that TFSAs will become an important complement to RRSPs.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>"Nearly every Canadian should be contributing to a TFSA," tax expert Jamie Golombek tells MoneySense magazine's Rudy Mezzetta.</p>
<p>"While the amounts you can contribute may seem small now, the rare opportunity to earn tax-free income for life makes TFSAs a sure win."</p>
<p>Unlike an RRSP, Mr. Mezzetta writes, money contributed to a TFSA does not result in a tax deduction, and withdrawals do not have to be included in taxable income as they do with RRSPs.</p>
<p>Moreover, TFSAs can be used for any savings purpose -- a holiday, a home or for additional retirement funds.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>One bright spot of the financial crisis, Investment Executive magazine reports, is that Canadians are beginning to get serious about financial planning.</p>
<p>"Last fall was a real wake-up call to make sure they had enough time and money to retire on," Patricia Bowles of the B.C. Securities Commission states.</p>
<p>Boomers are overwhelmed with ever-more complicated investment advice, the magazine notes in a piece entitled "Back to the Classroom", at the same time as financial literacy plumbs new depths of ignorance. Consumers are advised to treat their financial affairs as they do their health, and the publication serves up a range of Investing 101 tips .</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Shake hands with the devil? You can't even tap his gloves</b>
</div><div>Peter Shawn Taylor   </div>
<div>886 words</div><div>21 January 2010</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>A great many illogical things happened during last year's H1N1 flu pandemic pandemonium. Banning pre-game glove taps at the hockey rink was easily the stupidest and most illogical thing to happen in Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>Kids' house league hockey games used to begin with the "Fair Play" greeting. Both teams would line up at centre ice, then the players would skate past each other and tap their gloves together. Following that, the teams peeled off and tapped gloves with the opposing coaches as well. As a coach myself, I always looked forward to this little ceremony as it gave me a chance to say hi to boys I've coached in previous years.</p>
<p>Around this time, the refs would also skate by the benches to pick up the game sheet, grab some pucks and shake hands with the coaches.</p>
<p>All this formality took a minute or two before the game. But it was a pleasant moment when the emphasis was on the community of sport, rather than the conflict of competition.</p>
<p>No longer. In October, Hockey Canada released a series of recommended H1N1 protocols – including the sensible precaution that every player should have his or her own water bottle.</p>
<p>Alliance Hockey, an umbrella group that includes hockey associations from Fort Erie to London and covers Waterloo, Kitchener and Cambridge, decided to go much further than Hockey Canada's recommendations and abolished the pre-game glove tap ceremony. Instead, team captains were told to meet at centre ice and tap gloves on behalf of their entire team. Refs were also forbidden to shake hands with coaches. "These changes are temporary while the crisis exists," read the Alliance orders.</p>
<p>As a coach and parent this policy, temporary or not, presented several mysteries.</p>
<p>First, is there any evidence that glove taps constitute a health risk? Hockey Canada's initial instructions said nothing of handshakes, let alone bumping gloves.</p>
<p>Second, if glove-to-glove contact is a health risk, why are we letting our boys play hockey at all? Even in non-checking house leagues, much more than gloves come in contact with each other. If glove taps are a danger, could anyone possibly survive a goalmouth pileup?</p>
<p>Third, if we are banning glove taps for health reasons, why are we requiring team captains to tap their gloves? Are captains resistant to H1N1? Or are we willing to sacrifice them to maintain some semblance of civility? And if so, who would ever want to be captain?</p>
<p>Of course, trying to answer these questions logically is pointless. The policy makes no sense because there is no danger involved in tapping gloves. Alliance Hockey was unique in its panicked response to H1N1. Just down the road in Guelph, which belongs to a different hockey association, young players are still greeting each another in the traditional way. And the city survives.</p>
<p>If we ascribe the ban on glove taps to a temporary loss of sanity due to a health panic, at the very least we should expect it to be over by now.</p>
<p>Region of Waterloo Public Health held its final H1N1 public vaccination clinic on Monday. Emergency response measures were cancelled back in December. And the Public Health Agency of Canada reported last week that most flu indicators are now below normal levels. The risk has passed.</p>
<p>Despite all this, Tony Martindale, executive director of Alliance Hockey, suggests the ban may be here to stay, whatever the flu situation. "We find it's sped up the game and so I think we're going to stick with it," he said in an interview. To gain a few more minutes on the ice, the association is planning a permanent end to any recognition of sportsmanship or camaraderie before games. It seems a shame.</p>
<p>Everyone, not just hockey players, coaches and parents, should be upset over this policy. Social handshaking of all forms was a major victim of the H1N1 flu scare. Many churches no longer greet visitors with a handshake on Sunday. At its fall convocation, Wilfrid Laurier University replaced hand shakes between graduates and school officials with elbow smashes. When the Dalai Lama visited Memphis recently, the mayor welcomed him with a knuckle bump.</p>
<p>But handshaking is a long-standing North American custom that injects a modicum of physical contact and personal connection into our daily lives. Modern culture seems sufficiently isolated and insular that we ought to resist any further social distancing. The hand shake – and the pre-game glove tap – is worth fighting for.</p>
<p>And it will be up to individuals to demand its return.</p>
<p>If there is a hopeful sign from local hockey, it's that after many awkward fist bumps and head nods, coaches and referees are once again shaking hands before games, regardless of what Alliance Hockey says. It just seems like the most natural way to say hi. Teams have also abandoned the captains' sacrificial glove tap as ludicrous. Either we all tap gloves, or no one does. That's how it works in a community.</p>
<p>According to Martindale, Alliance Hockey will be discussing pre-game greetings at its next meeting on Jan.30. If sportsmanship counts for anything, they'll tap gloves and get on with the game.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Caprica a world 'sliding over the edge'; Futuristic TV drama puts emotions before effects</b>
</div><div>Alex Strachan   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>833 words</div><div>21 January 2010</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>E6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Caprica, a dark, Philip K. Dick-inspired parable about a futuristic society corroding from within, may not touch a popular nerve the way its spiritual ancestor Battlestar Galactica did.</p>
<p>For actors Eric Stoltz, Esai Morales and writer-producers David Eick and Jane Espenson, though, popularity and ratings are less important than ensuring the show is tough, uncompromising, and unafraid to take risks.</p>
<p>Both Caprica and Battlestar Galactica employ "moral complexity," says Espenson, but the similarities end there.</p>
<p>Caprica features a world some residents fear is "sliding over the edge," says Espenson. "A lot of people think they have the answer, but it's not at all clear that they do have the answer. The guy who believes in technology thinks that's the answer. The person who believes in religion thinks that's the answer. If everybody has these moral shadings, we can tell very complex stories as a result."</p>
<p>The show is set 58 years before the events in Battlestar Galactica, and follows two families -- the Graystones and the Adamas -- who are at opposite sides on the decision to creation intelligent robots (Cylons), who will one day turn on humanity and nearly destroy it.</p>
<p>Stoltz plays Daniel Graystone, a brilliant computer engineer consumed by a family tragedy who is driven to push the line between man and machine in his research. Morales plays defence attorney Joseph Adama, whose collaboration with Graystone eventually descends into a heated rivalry.</p>
<p>Stoltz and Morales say it was Caprica's emotional underpinnings that drew them to the project and convinced them to live in Vancouver, where the series is shot, for long stretches at a time.</p>
<p>Stoltz in particular immersed himself in Caprica's world of virtual emotions, and even directed an episode of his own, as well as acting in virtually every second scene in the 10 episodes filmed so far.</p>
<p>"I think, if anything, we go more toward that internal aspect of the story rather than shying away from it as we go forward," Stoltz said. "What interests me as an actor, what interests all the actors I think, is playing these ambiguous, conflicted people who are trying to find their way in life, and in this world."</p>
<p>Morales says the actors immersed themselves in their roles from the start, almost by instinct. It was hard to leave work behind at the end of the work day.</p>
<p>"The naturalism I saw from my fellow actors and their acting was, and is, I think unlike anything I've seen on television," Morales said. "The atmosphere, the setting of the show feels like it has a presence, a consciousness of its own. The show has evolved as it's gone along, but what you see going forward is rooted in those first two hours, I think."</p>
<p>Stoltz says Caprica's real resonance lies in the way it questions blind faith: faith in institutions, faith in power figures, faith in parenting.</p>
<p>"It strikes me that, in this day and age, we would love to think that our leaders, our captains of industry and politicians and scientists, are motivated by pure altruism rather than perhaps greed or personal demons.</p>
<p>"I think what's interesting about this story is that it shows that men and women are not always motivated by the best intentions. Things are happening in our world that are staggering, things like the atom collider in Geneva and even little things like the H1N1 vaccine. No long-term testing. Billions of dollars. We buy it. We hope it's good for us. Who knows what's going to happen in 10 years? We put so much faith in scientists and leaders and politicians that it's reached a ridiculous level. Hopefully, that will be one element of what we're trying to make a challenging and yet fun, entertaining show."</p>
<p>Eick says that while the words were on the page from the beginning, the actors' naturalistic take on the story was evident early on.</p>
<p>Stoltz, Morales and Paula Malcomson are all seasoned performers, Eick said, but in the end the story hinged on the performers playing the teenagers, Alessandra Torresani and Vancouver-native Magda Apanowicz.</p>
<p>Eick was determined that Caprica recall the stark emotional terrain of adult, cerebral HBO dramas more than the space-driven pyrotechnics of most TV science fiction.</p>
<p>"We have this magnificent actress in Alessandra who we knew could deliver all the complexities of this angst-</p>
<p>ridden young woman," Eick said. "It would be cheating her, cheating the audience, cheating the show and cheating our storytelling ability to limit it to just visual effects."</p>

</p>
<p>There's a reason they call it the toughest motor race on the planet: More people reach the summit of Mount Everest each year than finish the annual Dakar rally.</p>
<p>This year, there were 362 entries at the start on New Year's Day, but barely half made it across the finish line on Sunday. There were six Canadian efforts in 2010 – more than anyone can ever recall but only one Canadian would finish the rally. They each faced their own challenges, but agree on one thing. The hardest of the 17 days came on Stage Three.</p>
<p>The day from Hell</p>
<p>It was the toughest day, in the toughest race. After two days of relatively easy dirt tracks, the racers had to confront the desert of Fiambala, Argentina. Seventy-seven would drop out on this day alone. Scorching temperatures, towering dunes, talcum sand and poor quality fuel conspired to destroy their bodies, spirits and machines. “After Hell, there is Fiambala,” one competitor said afterward.</p>
<p>On paper, it was the shortest special stage of the rally at 182 kilometres; on the clock, it was the longest. The pro motorcycle riders did it in about six hours. The last amateur to finish in regulation time spent 16 hours on the bike, and others took even more time, only to be disqualified for taking too long or missing too many checkpoints. Several vehicles had trouble with the fuel from the last service station before the start of the special stage, which boiled away in the tanks due to the altitude and heat, causing engines to sputter and die.</p>
<p>One rider, Christina Meier from Germany, abandoned her stalled bike and borrowed a spectator's horse to reach her mechanic, get some advice, gallop back to the machine and get it going again to finish the day, and eventually the rally.</p>
<p>Despite carrying three or more litres, most had to rely on water from spectators and passing car competitors – and even that wasn't enough to keep several from needing intravenous re-hydration as temperatures were recorded as high at 59C.</p>
<p>What little power the bad fuel provided the engines was zapped by the mountainous dunes of powder fine sand, draining racers' energy to dig out and pick up fallen machines. And with every fall, came the risk of a race-ending injury. So many were stricken on the day, that every available helicopter was commandeered for medical evacuation, and doctors were sent out on to the course to advise the most weakened racers to give up or risk death.</p>
<p>Over before it began</p>
<p>The bolts on the belt-drive system of Lawrence Hacking's custom pickup truck sheared off en route to the first special stage, and he and co-driver Christian Girouard, 38, couldn't get it repaired in time to make the start, forcing their disqualification from the race before it really began.</p>
<p>Hacking, 55 and a long-time enduro motorcycle rider and race organizer from Georgetown Ont., was the first Canadian to finish the Dakar on a bike in 2001, and he still hopes to be the first to finish in a car – but next year. “Sure, it's a disappointment, but this is a long-term plan,” he says. “We'll continue on.”</p>
<p>The unluckiest man</p>
<p>Donald Hatton had recovered from the injuries that nearly killed him in the 2009 Dakar. His hand had mended from the break he'd suffered on his first training ride back on a bike. He'd recuperated from a bout of H1N1 in October, and managed to rescue his bike from the parking compound on the start day this year when the one next to it went up in flames. After forgetting his time card before the start of the first special stage, he rode 180 extra kilometres to retrieve it and convinced race organizers to let him start nonetheless.</p>
<p>He persevered through the second stage with food poisoning that had him vomiting in his helmet and soiling his riding suit. But, in the end, the Duncan, B.C., motorbike shop owner couldn't overcome the poor fuel on Stage 3 that left his KTM 690 Rally with too little power to traverse the deep sand and steep dunes. Severely dehydrated and utterly dejected, the 51-year-old left the race course after just 37 kilometres, made his way to the bivouac, and was disqualified for missing too many checkpoints. “I was really suffering.”</p>
<p>The triathlete</p>
<p>Rick Hatswell knows how to push through to the finish, having completed marathons and Iron Man triathlons, but the sand and heat on Stage 3 had him stymied. “I've never ridden on such soft ground,” said the 34-year-old from Vancouver, who helps run the family's chain of collision-repair centres. “Every time I'd go about 10 feet, it felt, the bike would fall over or I'd get stuck.”</p>
<p>More than six hours in, making little progress in the dunes and still less than halfway to the finish, a highway visible in the distance was just too tempting. He pulled his KTM 525XC-W off the course and onto the road, goggles hiding the tears. “I just thought, I don't want to be coming in at midnight or be that guy stuck out in the desert with no water, and dying out in the desert.”</p>
<p>Pumped to finish</p>
<p>It was too late for Dirk Kessler to avoid the rock as he came around the soft sandy corner in the dry riverbed. It caught the 44-year-old's foot and twisted his leg back violently. He managed to stay on his KTM 690E, but when the adrenalin wore off, the knee gave out and the pain set in. With help from some of the local spectators, he duct-taped his hand pump to his leg as splint and pressed on to the first checkpoint 40 kilometres away.</p>
<p>There, a decision had to be made. With pain killers from the medical staff, he tried a few times to press on, but it hurt too much. “I'm no stranger to pain,” says Kessler, a San Francisco software developer originally from Vancouver, “but there was just no way to do another 80 kilometres.”</p>
<p>The long haul</p>
<p>Andrew Scott, 43, couldn't be reached for this article, but every time another competitor saw him on Stage 3, he seemed on the verge of giving up, they said. “He looked all dazed,” recalled one rider, who met him 74 kilometres and more than six hours after the start. “He said ‘I'm screwed but I'm going to keep going.' ”</p>
<p>Some time around three or four in the morning he pulled into the bivouac, exhausted after more than 20 hours on his Honda CRF450X. But he'd either taken too long, missed too many checkpoints, or become to fatigued to continue, and was out.</p>
<p>Dakar addict</p>
<p>The other Canadians had careers, wives and children to return to whether they finished the Dakar or not. For Montrealer Patrick Trahan, there is only the Dakar. A chance encounter at age 15 with a Dakar competitor had sparked a life-long dream. Twelve years ago, he left a job in IT to pursue it.</p>
<p>He showed up at his first rally in 1998 – a smaller one – with only a few hours of riding experience and a bike better suited to pizza delivery than desert racing, but somehow he finished. In 2000, he entered his first Dakar with scarcely more experience and didn't get far. When he wanted to try again in 2001, his wife gave him an ultimatum. He chose the Dakar, and after another early exit, was divorced and bankrupt. Two more Dakar attempts ended before the start line due to lack of funds. Even this year, he didn't have the last few thousand dollars he needed to get to Argentina until December, when the Honda dealers in Ontario pitched in.</p>
<p>All this was in the back of his mind at the 87th kilometre, less than half-way through the Third Stage, when the 42-year-old was stuck with one leg pinned under his fallen bike in the deep sand of a dry riverbed. He used the last of his energy to dig himself out, but worried his Dakar was over. “I was throwing up, and I couldn't stand I was so dizzy” from dehydration in the extreme heat, he said.</p>
<p>But local spectators revived him with food and cola and water. They brought some gas for his drained bike, and, after a 45-minute rest, he pressed on through the last 95 kilometres of sand, finishing the day in a little over nine hours.</p>
<p>There were other challenges right up to the finish. With a pinched fuel line on the final of the 14 stages, he ran out of gas five times and had to wave down a tanker truck for a final fill-up, but made it to the finish podium in 55th position overall, becoming the sixth Canadian to ever finish the Dakar and completing his 27-year journey.</p>

<p>PASADENA, Calif. -- It looks like Conan O'Brien is leaving The Tonight Show the way he began, with Will Ferrell.</p>
<p>Internet buzz has already pegged this as O'Brien's last week in the job he took over from, and will now give back to, Jay Leno, but Ferrell's name on a list of guests released Tuesday for the Friday show is the strongest indication so far it's coming true.</p>
<p>Ferrell was O'Brien's first Tonight Show guest last June 1. He's to be joined on Friday's show by Tom Hanks.</p>
<p>There was still no official deal late Wednesday to allow Leno to take over from O'Brien.</p>
<p>But David Letterman is continuing to make the most of the mess. On Tuesday night, an increasingly giddy Letterman couldn't resist taking more shots at Leno, especially Leno's comment on Monday that he doesn't blame O'Brien.</p>
<p>"No one is blaming Conan," Letterman said. "In the thousands and thousands of words that have been printed about this mess, who has blamed Conan? No one! No one has blamed Conan!"</p>
<p>Intriguingly, it has been suggested that it is the American taxpayer who will foot the bill for O'Brien's NBC settlement package, given the recent government bailout of its parent company, <span class="companylink">General Electric</span>, which is, with FCC approval, hoping to sell off the ailing network to cable giant <span class="companylink">Comcast</span>.</p>
<p>GLOBAL WARMTH: So you're the gobsmacked young cast of the hit series Glee, basking in the warm glow of Sunday night's Golden Globe win for your very first season on the air. What's the first thing you do?</p>
<p>Apparently, you run out for junk food. "Each one of us went to a different late night fast food joint," revealed Lea Michele, who plays the spotlight-craving Rachel, at a meet-and-greet the following day on the show's high school choir-room set on the Paramount lot.</p>
<p>"There was no food at the Golden Globes dinner," explained Jane Lynch, a.k.a. Sue Sylvester, Glee's incarnation of evil. "They promised us dinner and we got nothing!"</p>
<p>At the awards ceremony, the star-struck Glee-sters found themselves surrounded by famous fans.</p>
<p>"We were jaw-dropped who came over and told us that they loved it or their kids loved it," marvelled creator Ryan Murphy. "I was kind of freaked out that Julianne Moore was a fan."</p>
<p>"She was like, 'I'm so embarrassed, but can I take a picture of you for my kids?'" grinned Kevin (Artie) McHale. "I'm like, 'Can I take a picture with you afterwards?'"</p>
<p>Yet another famous "Gleek," Murphy revealed, is pop diva Jennifer Lopez. In fact, she's been after him to write her a cameo role.</p>
<p>"I'm meeting with Jennifer," Ryan said. "We're going to have dinner and talk about it. I would love for her to play a really great cafeteria lady who Kurt makes over into, like, a Susan Boyle sensation or something."</p>
<p>BATTLE FATIGUE: The Battlestar Galactica prequel Caprica debuts Friday night on Space, and if you've seen the promos you already know that, red-eyed chrome robots notwithstanding, it is a very different show than its predecessor.</p>
<p>That being said, there are certain common themes. "There's something wonderful and amazing about the culture that was set up in Battlestar," explains writer/producer Jane Esperson.</p>
<p>"(There are) interesting things in this culture that have carried over from Battlestar to this world and that we've gotten to explore a lot more because we're dealing with a thriving city in which they're not, you know, running for their lives."</p>
<p>For series star Eric Stoltz, it's all about the similarities to our world and extrapolations thereof.</p>
<p>"There are things happening in our world that are staggering ... the atom collider in Geneva and little things even like the H1N1 vaccine. No long-term testing. Billions of dollars. We buy it. We hope it's good for us," he said.</p>
<p>"We put so much faith in scientists and leaders and politicians that I think it's achieved a ridiculous level.</p>
<p>"And hopefully, that will be an element, you know, one of lots of fun and entertaining ones in our show."</p>

</p>
<p>The Victoria Grizzlies remain undefeated in 2010. Building on a winning streak that began Jan. 2, the Grizzlies extended it to six consecutive games last night at Bear Mountain Arena, with a 2-0 victory over the Nanaimo Clippers.</p>
<p>It was the fourth shutout of the season for Victoria goaltender Ryan Holfeld, the game's first star.</p>
<p>"Our goaltender was outstanding," Grizzlies coach Victor Gervais said. "He brings confidence for all the kids. When there's a goalie back there they know is going to shut [the other team] down, it gives them confidence."</p>
<p>The Clippers are also streaking, but straight down. Still missing key players to injury, Last night's loss was Nanaimo's ninth straight, including one in overtime. The Clips (16-21-1-9) have posted just one win in their last 18 games.</p>
<p>"I give full credit to Nanaimo. They came and played a real hard game," said Gervais, who doesn't expect the downward trend to continue much longer. "They're a team that's going to break out. They can win the next 10 games."</p>
<p>The last time Nanaimo and Victoria met, they took a scoreless game into overtime, where Jordan Heywood fired the 1-0 winner. Wednesday night's battle -- a makeup game for one postponed during the swine flu outbreak -- was more of the same: Plenty of action, but nobody was able to light up the scoreboard behind a couple of tough netminders.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies, now in a tie with Langley for third place in the B.C. Hockey League Coastal Conference, had many of the best chances, especially during more than a minute on a five-one-three power play in the first period. Shots were 15-5 for Victoria at that point, but Nanaimo goaltender Loic Boivin stood up to the attack.</p>
<p>At the other end, former Grizzlie Teal Burns opened the game by crashing</p>
<p>Victoria defenceman Brett Kolins into Holfeld at the Victoria net. Holfeld was slow to get up, but shook off the hit.</p>
<p>The Clippers Kyle Kramer took another shot at Holfeld early in the second period, resulting in the second goaltender interference call of the night on Nanaimo. With the Grizzlies also a man short, Joel Lowry had a clear shot from the point, and gave the home side a 1-0 lead at 4:06 of the second.</p>
<p>Withstanding a flurry of Nanaimo pressure to open the third period, the Grizzlies responded. A power-play goal by Jordan Heywood slid smoothly under Boivin to add the insurance marker at 13:59 of the final frame.</p>
<p>"We've had a lot of improvement in our D-zone and on the power play since Christmas, and I think that has resulted in the wins," said Holfeld.</p>
<p>The Grizzlies (25-14-2-5) are back at the Bear tomorrow, playing host to the Trail Smoke Eaters at 7:15 p.m., and go over the Malahat on Saturday to visit the Cowichan Valley Capitals.</p>

</p>
<p>When I went online to vote for my choice cities as squares on the new Canadian version of Monopoly, both seemed out of contention, Regina mired in 30th place and Moose Jaw merely a write-in candidate. No problem. Deploying the standard Monopoly catch-up strategy from my boyhood, I accidentally overturned my desk with both hands and said oops.</p>
<p>Ah, Monopoly memories. The game used to be the best, didn't it? Patented in 1935, for 60 years the board game in its original form topped all competition, right up until games of the stupid computer eclipsed not only Monopoly's popularity, but also that of childhood and productive office work. To boost sales, <span class="companylink">Hasbro</span> now strikes licensing agreements for theme versions based on every overexposed bit of popular culture, from Harry Potter Monopoly to Family Guy Monopoly to, goodness knows, H1N1/Slap Chop Guy/Jon and Kate Monopoly.</p>
<p>I last played Monopoly only three weeks ago. We were at our tiny lake cabin for New Year's Eve, all seven of us -- mom, dad, the triplets, little brother and the cocker spaniel -- enjoying the sort of family intimacy that can be known only when the windchill outside is minus 41. When my daughter suggested above the din that we play a board game, I whimpered enthusiastically.</p>
<p>The kids' choice was SpongeBob SquarePants Monopoly, the rules of which, the children assured me, were exactly those of old school Monopoly, but with game pieces inspired by the popular animated TV series, the cartoon itself inspired, as far as I can tell, by peyote.</p>
<p>I've always excelled at Monopoly. For whatever reason, I do have a knack for recognizing undervalued real estate and leveraging timely acquisitions to enhance capital return. (I am not bragging. Monopoly is a game, not real life, tragically. I am also a crack table-top hockey player, but that's not me you see on TV Saturday night dishing off the puck cross-ice with a 780-degree body spin for Jarome Iginla to score the game winner.)</p>
<p>In other words, the kids were going down, hard. That's how confident I was, right from the get-go, our choice of Monopoly tokens, when I couldn't find my wheelbarrow and had make to do with a squid (like that's never happened before) (spring break, U of S, 1980 -- but a long story; no need here for details).</p>
<p>For us purists, the upcoming Canadian version of Monopoly is similarly pointless. About a month remains to vote by computer, a la Idol, on 65 suggested cities, but you have to think that with only 22 available title deeds and our relatively small populations, the best that Regina could now do is to squeak into the sad sack purples, the humiliating ghetto, for a basic rent of $4, better than, say, that $2 Baltic Avenue loser outfit, probably Sarnia, but still.</p>
<p>Instead, why not a true Canadian Monopoly game, with a complete metric conversion of the American "rules" into Canadian "regulations"?</p>
<p>For example, the Reading and Short Line railroads on the right side of the board we rename Canadian Pacific and CN, and those lines on the left, the west side, we abandon. At the start of the game, every player gets five "Get Out of Jail Free" cards, courtesy the National Parole Board. Before a player with a complete colour set can declare a monopoly, he first has to seek approval of the federal competition bureau (nudge, wink), and everybody enjoys a good thigh-slapping yuck over that bon mot regulation.</p>
<p>If you pass go, collect $121, proceed immediately to income tax and surrender a further 32 per cent. Community Chest card: "Bank error in your favour. Pay back the $200, plus interest, and a $12 service charge." Chance: "You are assessed for street repairs. Pay $400 into the federal infrastructure stimulus fund to help finance Ottawa's new History of Federal Taxation Museum and watch out for that pothole when you round Free Parking."</p>
<p>Dibs on the wheelbarrow.</p>

<div>PANDEMIC RESPONSE</div>
<div>Comment</div>
<div id="hd"><b>How the WHO overshot on H1N1; There was no conspiracy of fear or effort to inflate pharmaceutical profits, say Richard Schabas and Neil Rau – the real problem was an inability to adapt to changing circumstances</b>
</div><div>RICHARD SCHABAS AND NEIL RAU   </div>

</p>
<p>The dust is now settling on the H1N1 “pandemic.” After all the ballyhoo, the impact of H1N1 was not very different from that of a typical seasonal flu. There were more young people sick but a lot fewer older people sick and no health-care crisis or economic or social collapse.</p>
<p>Some European politicians are alleging that pressure from drug companies led the World Health Organization to overshoot. Indeed, pharmaceutical and medical supply companies heavily profited. But, despite the appeal of a conspiracy theory, we believe the fundamental error was a rigid adherence to pre-existing pandemic plans.</p>
<p>OVERSHOOT #1: DEFINITION OF A PANDEMIC</p>
<p>The power of words is enormous. Much of the worldwide overreaction to H1N1 can be traced to the WHO's zeal to declare a “pandemic.” Just before the new H1N1 was identified, the WHO made a subtle but important change in its own definition of “pandemic.” It dropped the key requirements that a pandemic virus had to be completely novel – an antigenic shift – and cause widespread and severe disease. These were characteristics of previous pandemics.</p>
<p>Almost immediately, as luck had it, a virus appeared that fit the new pandemic definition – but not the old one. The difference turned out to be crucial. Most of the older population had been exposed to a similar virus that circulated for many years before 1957 and were protected from the new H1N1. As a result, the people most vulnerable to severe disease were largely spared.</p>
<p>This pattern was obvious from the start, when the number of deaths in Mexico was far lower than the tens of thousands predicted by pandemic plans. Ignoring the rapidly accumulating contrary evidence, the WHO took the position it had to adhere to its new definition. Once a pandemic was declared, there was no turning back. On WHO instructions, all countries dutifully activated their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>OVERSHOOT #2: EVERYONE ‘NEEDS' VACCINE</p>
<p>World pandemic plans, which are designed to respond to catastrophes, called for mass immunization. These plans were followed religiously, even as H1N1 proved far milder than expected. Moreover, by early October, it was obvious that the vaccine would not arrive until the peak of the outbreak and then, initially, in small amounts. This called for a change in plan. The focus for immunization needed to shift exclusively to those at high risk – specifically, people with serious underlying chronic diseases.</p>
<p>The “worried well” needed to hear the bad news that they would not get the vaccine in time and the good news that they really didn't need it. Instead, our public health leadership wanted to have it both ways. They terrorized the public with exaggerations and misinformation, then tried to limit clinics to a high-risk minority. Chaos ensued.</p>
<p>OVERSHOOT #3: CARRY ON REGARDLESS</p>
<p>The H1N1 outbreak peaked in October, and disease rates dropped off rapidly in North America. Any benefit from immunizing healthy people had virtually vanished by mid-November, the very time when the vaccine became readily available to all. Speculation about a serious “third wave” is fading fast, as high population levels of immunity make it implausible.</p>
<p>Instead of sharing the good news – the danger has come and gone for otherwise healthy people – the current risk is exaggerated to justify ongoing futile vaccination efforts directed at the worried well.</p>
<p>Total deaths worldwide from H1N1 probably will end up lower than from typical seasonal flu. Yet, the WHO still labels this a moderate pandemic and has no plans to downgrade or simply call it off.</p>
<p>To be fair, a modicum of pandemic planning served a good purpose during the WHO's initial response. The WHO quickly moved into Mexico to gather information. International laboratory co-operation led to rapid identification of the H1N1 virus. Surveillance capabilities were enhanced worldwide, and countries quickly detected H1N1 in their midst. The impossibility of containment was quickly acknowledged, and futile travel advisories were discouraged. Vaccine development was started quickly.</p>
<p>It was once said that no plan survives the first five minutes of any battle. What this means, of course, is that any plan can be quickly superseded by events. The good public health leader, like the good general, needs to put more value on utilizing new information and less on simply following orders. This is the real lesson of H1N1.</p>
<p>Richard Schabas was Ontario's chief medical officer of health from 1987 to 1997. Neil Rau is an infectious diseases specialist and medical microbiologist in private practice in Oakville, Ont., and a University of Toronto lecturer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Silence on pedestrians' deaths has been deafening</b>
</div><div>Christopher Hume   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>626 words</div><div>20 January 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>In any other context, the deaths of eight people in seven days would be considered an outrage. Had the cause been gang warfare, H1N1 or car crashes, the news would be on everyone's lips.</p>
<p>But because the dead were simply pedestrians trying to cross the street, their killings become a statistic, cause for little more than the usual nodding of heads and wagging of fingers.</p>
<p>In fact, the deaths are an indictment of a society so cravenly dependent on the automobile that fatalities such as these are tacitly accepted as part of the cost of living here.</p>
<p>Everyone agrees it's an awful thing, but no one has suggested taking steps to deal with the carnage.</p>
<p>That would cause inconvenience and, worse still, slow traffic.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that although the number of road deaths in the city annually has dropped from 59 to 48 over the past five years, the number of pedestrians killed has increased from 29 to 31.</p>
<p>Pedestrians were the victims in 42 per cent of all traffic deaths last year, and that figure has grown during the past five years.</p>
<p>"Our (overall) fatality numbers are good," Toronto police Const. Hugh Smith told the Star this week. "But we are noticing a spike in our pedestrian fatalities."</p>
<p>No kidding.</p>
<p>So why aren't we talking about lowering speed limits, increasing penalties or narrowing city streets? Why aren't we discussing ways to improve crosswalks, intersections and road signage generally? And why aren't we trying to change a culture that quietly condones putting pedestrians' lives at risk?</p>
<p>Interesting, too, that two of the dead pedestrians were killed by bus drivers, who presumably know what they're doing. One was killed by a senior who is said to have run a red light, another by an alleged hit-and-run driver who drove through a stop sign. In one case, police say the driver had the right of way; the 80-year-old victim should have known better.</p>
<p>Various reasons have been proffered: there are more pedestrians now and more of them are wearing earphones and hats. The polite word for that is nonsense.</p>
<p>The truth is that for the past 60 years we have been building cities for cars, not people. The width of streets, speed limits, as well as the size and design of cars themselves are all carefully calibrated to suit drivers. We have so much invested in the vehicle, and it's assumed that traffic flow and congestion are symptomatic of general economic health.</p>
<p>But how healthy is a society willing to risk the lives of its citizens - particularly seniors - so drivers can get to work without being inconvenienced? And we're not talking about pedestrians crossing Highway 401 or the Don Valley Parkway, but Eglinton Ave., Mt. Pleasant Rd. and Roncesvalles Ave.</p>
<p>It's time for a serious reality check, especially in Toronto, a city proud of the Pedestrian Charter it adopted in 2002, a document not worth the paper it is printed on. And as for the "war on the car," that so worries some of our more febrile councillors ... if only.</p>
<p>And where does Mayor David Miller stand? What does police Chief Bill Blair - always so vocal about gangs and guns - have to say about these deaths? So far, the silence has been deafening.</p>
<p>By contrast, other jurisdictions have taken measures to enhance pedestrian safety. The Dutch have woonerfs, roads without signs that are shared by drivers and pedestrians. Though completely counterintuitive, they seem to work.</p>
<p>In the GTA, we love pedestrians, as long as they stay off the streets.</p>

<p>Things will be back to normal at local Catholic churches this weekend as restrictions on some practices in light of the H1N1 flu are being lifted.</p>
<p>A letter was sent this week from Bishop Ronald Fabbro to the priests in more than 120 churches that restrictions on communion from the cup, on the tongue and shaking of hands have been lifted.</p>
<p>"We're just going back to regular practices," said diocese spokesman Mark Adkinson.</p>
<p>The restrictions have been in place since the weekend of Oct. 24 and 25.</p>
<p>The lifting of restrictions for the 622,000 Catholics in Elgin, Essex, Huron, Kent, Lambton, Middlesex, Norfolk, Oxford and Perth counties follows an analysis of available information by parishes, health professionals and health units.</p>

</p>
<p>As the world rallies to help victims of last week's earthquake in Haiti, there's a sense of been there, done that.</p>
<p>This was the first quake in 200 years to hit the West's poorest country, but there have been so many other disasters -such as hurricanes, landslides and floods - that it's hard to keep track of them all. Billions of dollars in aid have poured into Haiti over the years, yet nothing seems to get any better.</p>
<p>Why is Haiti such a basket case while people in the Dominican Republic, which occupies the other half of the island of Hispaniola, live an average of 13 years longer and earn six times more?</p>
<p>The answer lies in the colonial past, Haitian and Dominican policies and, almost as importantly, the policies of the United States.</p>
<p>The Spanish settled Hispaniola in the 16th century, but ceded the western third to France as Spain's attention turned to the gold-and-silver rich Americas. France's new colony, based on forestry and sugar, became one of the richest in the Caribbean but only by importing thousands of slaves from Africa.</p>
<p>In the late 1700s, slaves revolted and established the world's first black republic in 1804. The United States, which refused to recognize the new nation for fear of undermining its own slavery system, led a worldwide boycott against Haiti that lasted until nearly the end of the U.S. Civil War in 1865.</p>
<p>Also isolating Haiti was its own constitution, which sought to block a return to colonialism by barring foreigners from owning land.</p>
<p>"To European eyes, the oversimplified image was of the Dominican Republic as a partly European society receptive to European immigrants and trade, while Haiti was seen as an African society composed of ex-slaves and hostile to foreigners," Jared Diamond writes in Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed.</p>
<p>"With the help of invested capital from the U.S., the Dominican Republic began to develop a market export economy, Haiti far less so."</p>
<p>Concerned about risks to the Panama Canal because of political turmoil in the Caribbean, the United States occupied the entire island of Hispaniola during the First World War. In the Dominican Republic, Americans trained an army headed by Rafael Trujillo, who became president, then dictator when U.S. troops pulled out.</p>
<p>Though ruthless, Trujillo sought to modernize his nation. He developed the infrastructure and economy "mostly running the country as his own private business," Diamond writes and took important steps to protect its forests.</p>
<p>Haiti had its own ruthless dictator, Francois (Papa Doc) Duvalier. But unlike Trujillo, he had no interest in modernization or the environment. One result: massive deforestation that has led to soil erosion, which in turn decreases crop yields and causes deadly landslides.</p>
<p>From the air, the border between the two countries "divides a darker and greener landscape east of the line (the Dominican side) from a paler, brown landscape west of the line (the Haitian side)," Diamond notes. "That contrast exemplifies a difference between the two countries as a whole."</p>
<p>U.S. economic and military aid along with American manufacturers drawn to Haiti by cheap wages helped keep Duvalier and his son, Jean-Claude, in power for nearly three decades.</p>
<p>But the regime's downfall began in the early '80s when the United States insisted that Haiti destroy its entire pig crop after an outbreak of swine flu.</p>
<p>That threw thousands of pig farmers out of work and started an uprising that led to "Baby Doc's" exile to Paris in 1986.</p>
<p>Nor was that the only time U.S. policy undercut gains made by U.S. aid.</p>
<p>Before 1950, Haiti produced most of its own food.</p>
<p>But after the International Monetary Fund persuaded it to reduce import tariffs in the'80s, U.S. rice poured into the country and put many rice farms out of business. Today, three-fourths of Haiti's rice comes from the United States.</p>
<p>American meddling has also contributed to Haiti's long history of political instability. In 2000, for example, exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide returned to office with U.S. support.</p>
<p>Four years later, amid corruption allegations, he alleges he was "kidnapped" by U.S. Marines and forced into exile again.</p>
<p>Haiti's current president is Rene Preval, who heads a country that was languishing far behind the Dominican Republic even before Tuesday's quake.</p>
<p>But $100 million in relief has been pledged by the United States, Haiti's sometimes benefactor, sometimes nemesis.</p>

</p>
<p>Ottawa needs a comprehensive city-wide approach to food security, according to Dr. Isra Levy, the city's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Levy, taking a rare opportunity to speak about something other than H1N1, addressed the annual general meeting of the Ottawa Food Bank Monday night, outlining some of the things Ottawa Public Health is doing to address the issue.</p>
<p>"People who are hungry cannot be healthy," Levy wrote in the prepared text he planned to deliver at the event. The speech talked about the rising cost of food, the impact on the health of Ottawa residents, and the challenges of food security.</p>
<p>"For me, food security exists when all people at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food that meets their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life," the speech said. The average cost of feeding a family of four in Ottawa was $736.00 per month in 2009, a 15- to 20-per-cent increase from 2008, according to Levy.</p>
<p>"There is a strong connection between food security and health. Poor birth outcomes, reduced learning and productivity, higher risks of chronic diseases and lack of nutrients such as folate, iron, zinc and vitamin A are examples of some of the health effects of people not living in food secure situations.</p>
<p>"We recognize that food security is a social determinant of health and is an important public health issue," the speech said. Last year, Ottawa Public Health formed a short-term task group to look at food security, which led to several immediate initiatives.</p>
<p>Following one recommendation, the OPH nutrition team and the Ottawa Food Bank are piloting a project with three food hamper programs and the Community Food Advisor Volunteers. These volunteers shared different ways of using available food to support healthy eating practices. For example, they showed microwave and hotplate cooking, using baked beans creatively and gave ideas for using canned fruit and vegetables.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Theatre groups hit by holiday doldrums; Recession, weather cited in slowdown</b>
</div><div>Bob Clark   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>974 words</div><div>19 January 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>E1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Was it the recession or the weather?</p>
<p>A bit of both, say the administrative heads of four major Calgary performing arts groups, when asked about lower audience numbers for their respective "cash cow" holiday season presentations in December.</p>
<p>In the case of the relatively soft turnout for the Calgary Philharmonic's signature Christmas performances of Handel's Messiah, you can blame the weather, says orchestra president and CEO, Ann Lewis-Luppino.</p>
<p>"Opening night -- and we had a blizzard," Lewis-Luppino recalls, noting that more than 1,000 hardy souls still made it to the concert which is traditionally a big seller for the CPO.</p>
<p>"So we didn't really make our target for that night, but that's really all," she says.</p>
<p>The orchestra responded in almost unprecedented fashion to the sudden downturn in Messiah attendees by offering those who missed out on the concert the chance to apply their tickets to the following night's performance -- or any other concert.</p>
<p>Very few simply turned in their tickets for refunds, Lewis-Luppino points out -- which, given the success of the other main CPO December event, the John Mc-Dermott concert ( "it wasn't a sellout, but it exceeded our target," she says) made for a fairly even month at the CPO box office.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, next door at Alberta Theatre Projects, Toad wasn't exactly pulling in the crowds. The monthlong run of Toad of Toad Hall, a family-oriented show based on The Wind in the Willows, garnered an audience of 14,245 -- about 20 per cent off target, according to ATP interim managing director Patti Pon.</p>
<p>Several factors may have played a role in the lower body count, Pon says -- such as unrealistically high projections in the first place; an opening night that coincided with Grey Cup weekend; audience unfamiliarity with the Toad of Toad Hall backstory; the aforementioned winter storm (and the really cold weather that followed) -- and the recession.</p>
<p>"I think that what many Calgarians saw and heard in the media about people being careful with their holiday dollars was true," says Pon.</p>
<p>"Where once upon a time we may have seen families buy six or eight tickets, this year (2009) they were buying four."</p>
<p>At Theatre Calgary, president Tom McCabe said the company surpassed its $750,000 revenue projection for A Christmas Carol but finished down a relatively modest $10,000, because of the cost of an understudy they hired in case an actor caught the H1N1 flu. Their real challenge for the company was trying to figure out a changing mix of Christmas Carol theatregoers.</p>
<p>"The sales didn't occur at the levels we had anticipated in each category -- there were more adult tickets sold, but fewer subscribers' tickets," McCabe said.</p>
<p>"Now in some respects, because it's not part of the subscribers' season, that's good -- because we give subscribers a half-price ticket and, of course, single ticket buyers pay full price."</p>
<p>A skewed ticket sales distribution of a more recessionary kind was observable in the case of Alberta Ballet, which in December experienced a 15 to 20 per cent drop in revenues in Calgary from its production of The Nutcracker in Calgary -- and a 30 per cent drop in the show's box-office tally in Edmonton.</p>
<p>Alberta Ballet executive director Darryl Lindenbach takes the holiday season shortfalls in stride, pointing out that the Christmas ballet did exceptionally well in the two previous Decembers because those years represented the first presentation of the company's new version of Nutcracker (choreographed by Edmond Stripe in late 2008) and the final presentation of the old Nutcracker in 2007.</p>
<p>"We actually have to go back four years or more (to find a fair comparison)," Lindenbach says. "And when we compare against that, it's astronomically good."</p>
<p>But while the revenue in Calgary was down, the numbers were good, Lindenbach points out.</p>
<p>"We sold about the same number of tickets in Calgary, but people bought cheaper seats," he says. "This year, the house filled totally differently -- so I think we're seeing the (effect of the) economy.</p>
<p>"People are still coming to enjoy the show, but they're just not spending as much money to do so."</p>
<p>Another factor in lower Nutcracker ticket sales was the lack of seasonal weather in much of the ticket-selling period leading up to the performances.</p>
<p>"Having no snow does hurt us, because it doesn't feel like Christmas -- and people aren't there, yet," Lindenbach says.</p>
<p>Still, Lindenbach remains unruffled, even philosophical, about the prospect of fallout from Nutcracker's less-than-spectacular ability to put much-needed bums in the seats in 2009. After all, season ticket sales have been good, Alberta Ballet's re-mount of artistic director Jean Grand-Maitre's Romeo and Juliet exceeded expectations, and says Lindenbach, "we're seeing the rest of our shows track well."</p>
<p>Even when added to the $186,000 hit Alberta Ballet took from the cancellation of the National Ballet production of Sleeping Beauty which was to have opened Alberta Ballet's 2009-2010 season, the Nutcracker shortfall isn't having an impact on planning of future productions.</p>
<p>"We're not going to cannibalize the art because of something that happened now," Lindenbach says. "We've got a great product, and at the end of the day the product will win.</p>
<p>"No, it (Nutcracker) didn't hit budget, but maybe our budgets were a little off.</p>
<p>"And hey, if that's it -- we'll deal with it, and move on."</p>

<p>- - The underwear problem at the remand centre brings the old good news/ bad news joke to life.</p>
<p>- - After all the recent media fearmonger-ing, fed by the overblown news about climate change and H1N1, it now borders on surreal to absorb the all-too-real tragedy in Haiti.</p>
<p>- - If you wish to donate to a charity but don't want them to hound you forever, go to any post office, get a money order payable to cash, and mail it in an envelope with no return address.</p>
<p>- - It will be interesting to see if Ron Liepert is as tough on the oil barons as he was on health care.</p>
<p>- - Jacqueline Greenly's interview with new Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky on Shaw gave me a little more faith in our government. I think he is the right man for the big job ahead of him.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ambulance service dispute not being felt by the public; No pressure on either side to settle, says report on labour relations</b>
</div><div>Vaughn Palmer   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>855 words</div><div>19 January 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>-When the B.C. Liberals tapped retired public servant Chris Trumpy to inquire into the bitter labour relations in the ambulance service, the union representing paramedics refused to take part.</p>
<p>Trumpy was too close to the governing party, claimed the leaders of CUPE Local 873. Thus, the whole process was "a sham."</p>
<p>But Trumpy's 30-year record in the public service provided no basis for the smear. The previous New Democratic Party government held him in such high regard that he was appointed deputy minister of finance, the second most important post in the entire public service.</p>
<p>Indeed, he has the unique distinction of having served as deputy minister of finance under four premiers, three of them New Democrats, only one of them a Liberal.</p>
<p>Happily, his reputation for even-handedness did not go unnoticed in other quarters. Three other unions in the health care sector did talk to him in the course of the inquiry. So did some intrepid members of CUPE Local 873.</p>
<p>"I received insightful comments from a number of individual paramedics," noted Trumpy in his 50-page report, released Monday. "They are committed to providing professional care throughout B.C. and would love to get involved in moving the ambulance service forward."</p>
<p>Thanks to those and other consultations, he was able to get a handle on the record of failed labour relations in ambulance service. Over 25 years, the employer and the union have rarely managed to reach a contract settlement without some sort of third-party intervention.</p>
<p>The main reason, says Trumpy, flows from the fact that virtually all positions in the ambulance service are covered by essential service legislation. "Practically speaking, the right to strike does not exist."</p>
<p>In the dispute that dragged through much of last year, some 95 per cent of the 3,500 unionized positions were designated essential and thus excluded from any withdrawal of services. "Very little service impact was felt by the public, which meant very limited pressure on management to settle."</p>
<p>Neither was there any of the usual pressure that a strike puts on the labour side.</p>
<p>"From the union's perspective, since the vast majority of their members continued to work with no impact on income, there was limited pressure to settle for less than they were demanding."</p>
<p>The government intervened to legislate an end to the dispute, as Trumpy notes, only when it began to worry about the double risk posed to "the H1N1 pandemic and the upcoming Olympic Games."</p>
<p>Options for fixing a broken bargaining system? The report cites several, along with the implications for each.</p>
<p>The paramedics could be incorporated into a broader bargaining unit with other health care unions, which have a better record of reaching settlements without strikes or third-party assistance.</p>
<p>Some paramedical work could be delegated to emergency services in rural and remote areas, where the ambulance service has difficulty recruiting and retaining paramedics in any event.</p>
<p>Privatization? Other provinces contract out some ambulance services to private operators. But Trumpy stopped well short of making a case for doing it here. "Cost implications of transferring service to a private operator are not known and could be higher or lower,"</p>
<p>The union wanted last year's dispute to be submitted to arbitration. Trumpy noted that option as well as government's reason for refusing to go that route: "Evidence seems to suggest that conventional interest arbitration results in higher costs."</p>
<p>His review of ambulance services here and elsewhere found little evidence that B.C. paramedics are a hardship case.</p>
<p>When hired, they tend to stay hired: "Attrition is relatively low, and within the range of other employees in the provincial health care sector." Ranked according to "total compensation"-- wages, plus benefits, plus pension -- "B. C. paramedics are paid slightly less than those in Ontario, but generally more than other provinces."</p>
<p>But for all that, he had to concede that the union stance of non-cooperation had limited his ability to conclude anything definitive on a range of issues. Those included recruitment, retention, training, workload, staff deployment, workplace safety and compensation.</p>
<p>The tight time frame was another constraint. The Liberals wanted the report in hand before the next round of bargaining with paramedics, which (because last year's imposed settlement expires March 31) commences almost immediately.</p>
<p>Trumpy closed his covering letter to the government by urging it "to find a way to engage CUPE 873 and its membership in discussions" on "effective labour relations and the structure of the ambulance service."</p>
<p>A worthy objective. But given the union's reluctance to talk to anyone other than itself, no easy thing to accomplish.</p>

<p>Antoine Wright finished with eight points and four rebounds in 24 minutes of Sunday's Raptors win. But his most important contribution came at the other end of the court. "He had to guard Dirk Nowitzki and he had to guard Jason Terry and chase him around," said coach Jay Triano. "Those are two different assignments and two tough assignments."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quality health care the top priority; Alberta health services</b>
</div><div>Stephen Duckett   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>629 words</div><div>17 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>

<p>Re: " Alberta Health Services going rogue; Growing power a problem for gov't," by Paula Simons, Jan. 12.</p>
<p>Paula Simons' Jan. 12 column continues The Journal's campaign against AHS, and me personally.</p>
<p>Simons argues that AHS has had some problems (and this can't be denied -- in the case of her example of the rollout of the H1N1 vaccine, I'd agree), but goes on to suggest, without evidence, that there has been a litany of events which embarrassed the premier's office and undercut the minister's or premier's authority.</p>
<p>Much of her commentary reflects a lack of understanding of how government ought to work. She refers, for example, to "the extraordinary decision by AHS to borrow $220M from the Royal Bank."</p>
<p>AHS's choice of bank was determined by a tender process, including a competitive analysis of the interest rate at which we could borrow money. The Royal Bank won with the most competitive proposal. It is unclear whether the "extraordinary" aspect of the decision is that we followed good business practices to save the health system money, or that a private bank provided us the best deal.</p>
<p>Implicit in her column is that political consequences should be the principal criterion that AHS uses in decision-making. I can't agree. As Simons points out, AHSA is at arm's length from government. The point of being at arm's length is that the decisions we make ought to be about access, quality and sustainability of the health-care system. It is our job to provide health care and improve the health status of Albertans. Improving access, improving quality and improving sustainability should be the basis for our decision-making and in this respect there is no misalignment whatsoever in our relationship with the government.</p>
<p>In a democracy the government determines the budget. AHS does not determine our funding envelope; that is a government decision. Once the government has made that decision, it is our job to live within the budget and in doing so, meet the policy objectives that have been established for us. And here the government, elected by Albertans, has indicated its clear commitment to promote access and quality as well. So there is in fact no difference between government and AHS in terms of what we are trying to achieve for the health system.</p>
<p>Simons also states "the amalgamation of the health boards (is) shaping up to be a financial debacle." There is no evidence to support this. The merger has saved Alberta taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. Consolidating 12 payroll systems into one, standardizing products and using the buying power of a single large organization, and sharing good ideas across the province to the other, have all led to improvements in care and non-clinical cost savings. Procurement alone is going to save us more than $200 million in 2010-11. How can this be called a debacle?</p>
<p>Simons also suggests that there are "more service cuts looming." Again, she produces no evidence. I am proud of the fact there have been almost no layoffs of clinical staff in AHS and to the extent there have been layoffs, they have been "technical" in the sense that there was no net reduction in employment.</p>
<p>My decision-making, as always, will be based on improving access, improving quality and improving sustainability of the health-care system for Albertans. I will not resile from that. I am sure this is what Albertans want, both as taxpayers and as potential users of the health-care system.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Seize the day to cruise to a lifelong goal; Some 'bucket list' accomplishments don't come cheap, but are worth every penny and some irritations</b>
</div><div>Jim Hume   </div>
<div>Special to Times Colonist</div>
<div>794 words</div><div>17 January 2010</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>D9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>It wasn't the most auspicious start for a 'bucket list" item. Having survived the irritations of airport security checks and the overwhelming confusion of LAX -- the one airport in the world I long ago grew to hate -- I was, after an overnight in the Hilton Airport Hotel, awaiting a shuttle to take me to the pier where Holland America's SS Amsterdam would transport me from Los Angeles to Fort Lauderdale, Fla.</p>
<p>On completion of that 14-day journey, I could cross "luxury ocean cruise" from my "things to do before I die list."</p>
<p>But there were problems. After being informed of the ship's late arrival in L.A., the two or three busloads of passengers waiting in the hotel were asked to complete a brief health questionnaire asking if they suffered from diarrhea in the past 24 hours, vomiting or high temperatures.</p>
<p>Curious, I thought, but in light of swine flu worries, not out of line and quickly forgotten on the short ride to dockside and a cluttered embarkation process during which we are updated verbally and by written communique on the reasons for the minor delays and health quiz.</p>
<p>En route to L.A., the Amsterdam had been fighting an unwelcome virus that had felled both crew and passengers. The information sheet advised us a thorough cleansing of the ship had taken place, but that in such an immense undertaking, there could be no guarantee of complete success.</p>
<p>If we would like to cancel, now was the time to do it with agents on stand-by ready to help re-arrange travel schedules and organize a replacement cruise.</p>
<p>It took 10 seconds for my travel group of two to decide that any company with such an up-front attitude in keeping its customers informed deserved our confidence and support. We boarded and sailed about an hour behind our scheduled departure time.</p>
<p>I recite the nervous start not with an air of gloom but rather one of appreciation.</p>
<p>In the past I, along with thousands and other travellers, have suffered similar delays without a word of explanation. It was a welcome surprise to come across a company that believes its customers need to be informed even if the news isn't the greatest of holiday tonics.</p>
<p>Once on our way, the information flow continued. We were informed when a crew member was evacuated at one port of call; we were provided updates on subsequent care and treatment; hand cleansing dispensers were in every corner of the ship; antiseptic hand-wipes were available to clean computer keyboards. And at least once every day, Captain Olav van der Waard briefed his passengers and crew on health conditions until he was able to announce that once again all was well, "but don't relax the preventive care you have been taking to help us" beat the bug.</p>
<p>Among the pleasanter pieces of information discovered after unpacking was the fact that I could have delivered to my cabin a bottle of scotch at a price several dollars cheaper than I pay at home. Thus equipped to fight any bugs that escaped regular hand cleaning, I could watch sunsets from my cabin balcony and know that all was well with the world.</p>
<p>And thus it was that we sailed leisurely south from L.A., with temperatures rising as we touched in at Puerto Vallarta, Huatulco and Puerto Chiapas in Mexico and Puerto Quetzal, Guatemala, then Fuerte Amador, Panama and through the incredible Panama Canal to Cartagena, Colombia, and eventually our final destination, Fort Lauderdale.</p>
<p>For me, it was a first cruise, although I had crossed the Atlantic three times on Cunard liners. But they were point-to-point journeys and always seemed to be taken in a hurry. With four young children to shepherd on two of those crossings, they were richly marked with touches of frantic exhaustion.</p>
<p>This time with an experienced fellow traveller for company it was -- apart from airport weariness -- relaxation all the way. Early morning coffee delivered to the cabin, leisurely breakfasts, light lunches, early dinners, first-class stage shows in a comfortable theatre, a great library of books to be read in a hundred quiet corners, CDs and DVDs to be listened to or watched in your cabin, a full temptation casino and daily religious services at which prayers of forgiveness for gambling losses could be offered, were all available.</p>
<p>And, yes, it was a little expensive. "Bucket list" items usually are, but with ability-to-travel time running out, carpe diem has never been more important.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No surprise - H1N1 cut into workplace productivity; Highest toll was in November: More than one million Canadians called in sick in one month due to flu</b>
</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK    </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>510 words</div><div>16 January 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Early</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>More than one million Canadians missed work in the month of November alone because of the flu, Statistics Canada reported yesterday.</p>
<p>And the productivity lost in that month alone was comparable to when Ontario and parts of the United States were hit with a massive power outage in the summer of 2003, the agency said.</p>
<p>Throughout the course of the H1N1 pandemic, public health officials have repeatedly asked Canadians to stay home if they are feeling sick, to help prevent the spread of the disease. As the numbers indicate, they appeared to listen.</p>
<p>On average, 1.5 million people lost 19.6 hours of work each because either they were sick or an immediate family member was ill with the H1N1 or the seasonal flu. The total number of hours lost for working Canadians aged 15 to 69 was just under 30 million.</p>
<p>The intensity of the H1N1 pandemic was high during most of the month of November and in fact, since the pandemic began last spring, about half of Canada's death toll to date occurred in that month.</p>
<p>As of Jan. 14, 418 deaths have been linked to the pandemic virus. More than 200 people died in November and hundreds were hospitalized.</p>
<p>Among the provinces, flu-related absenteeism was highest in Newfoundland and Labrador, where 14.2 per cent of workers lost hours and the lowest rate (7.6 per cent) was in Quebec.</p>
<p>Workers aged 30 to 44 had the highest rate of absenteeism of all of the age groups, and women missed work more often than men.</p>
<p>Nearly twice as many employees with children than those without lost work hours in November.</p>
<p>At the same time as people were away from their jobs, thousands of people were putting in overtime because of the flu.</p>
<p>About 600,000 people put in 8.6 million extra hours at work in November, the Statistics Canada report said.</p>
<p>Health-care workers were the most likely to report logging extra hours. They accounted for two million hours of the total.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada asked Statistics Canada to assess the impact of the flu on the labour force over a three-month period and this is its first report.</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus is now circulating at a low level in Canada but people are still being hospitalized and dying from it.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones said in an interview that about 45 to 50 per cent of the population has been immunized against H1N1.</p>
<p>"It looks like we have probably the most successful vaccine campaign in the world right now of any country of any significant size," he said. "That's a testimony to people at all levels including the individuals that have made the choice to protect themselves and others."</p>
<p>He still wants the vaccination rate to go higher, he said.</p>

<p>Fun is not just fun, according to new science. Thought to be pointless, trivial and frequently dangerous, it may be that fun actually makes us smarter, better and holds the key to our survival.</p>
<p>So, just for fun, here is the third instalment of Albert Nerenberg's three-part series: The Science of Fun.</p>

<p>- - -</p>
<p>I'm afraid we're very good at being afraid.</p>
<p>In fact, neuroscience says we're engineered for it. We have an almond-size organ called the amygdala, roughly at the centre of the human head, that assesses threats and manufactures fear. It does a fantastic job.</p>
<p>Science says fear is built right into us, but there's new evidence that the same is true of fun, and our brains seem to use fun to fight fear. And while we do get afraid like most other animals on the planet, we also may be the most fun-oriented species on Earth, although you wouldn't always know it.</p>
<p>Blame the amygdala. The current edition of the Pearson textbook of Abnormal Psychology describes the amygdala as nothing less than a "fear network" inside your head. Network is an entirely appropriate term because it acts like a breaking news channel constantly alerting you to alarming and worrisome stories and stresses. Scientists have noted the amygdala is great at getting your attention, scaring you and overriding other more rational parts of the brain. But this tiny paranoia powerhouse is not just good at making us afraid. It's extremely fast at making us afraid. A recent study on the fear of snakes showed the amygdala can tell us to be afraid of a snake, even before our eyes know they've seen a snake. That's fast. But here's the clincher. Fear as networked by the amygdala, is actually the human brain's default mode. Thanks to our fear architecture, most of us may be living paranoid, worry-filled lives. But according to new theories on fear, it might be time to finally tell the amygdala to relax and chill out.</p>
<p>Dan Gardner, author of The Science of Fear, says the current culture of generalized fear is out of control.</p>
<p>"It's no exaggeration to say that our species owes its very existence to fear. But unreasoning fear is another matter," writes Gardner, also a columnist for the Ottawa Citizen.</p>
<p>At one time, when we lived in the wild, it was essential to have a 24-hour fear network inside your head. The theory goes that evolving on the savannah surrounded by threats from every direction - things to step on, things that stalked us, things in the dark - we survived, by having a rapid-fire, threat-detection system that could produce a near instantaneous response - Run! Fight! Hide! The humans who feared, survived. The guy who happily went for a swim in crocodile creek didn't. We have to assume our ancestors were afraid on a regular basis and that's why we're here. The twist, says Gardner, is we now live in a very different world. Our fear response system is out of date but doesn't know it.</p>
<p>"We are literally the luckiest; we are the healthiest, safest people who've ever lived. We should be profoundly grateful for the safety and health with which we're blessed," Gardner claims. Basically, we should take stock and have a little more fun.</p>
<p>Few of us ever have to face the threats our ancestors did. When was the last time you saw a neighbour being eaten by lion? Gardner claims a fear trinity of media, politicians and "fear marketers" create a continuous carnival of frights that overstimulate the fear networks of the unknowing public.</p>
<p>Behold: Terrorists with bombs in their underwear, Internet stalkers, swine flu, new drugs, religious fundamentalists, genetically modified organisms, street crime, identity theft, rampant pedophiles, rainstorms, snowstorms, carcinogens, bacteria covered doorknobs, the obesity epidemic, pesticides, news diseases, killer fats, killer snacks, killer toys to name a few. Yes, these things are worth being afraid of, but the fear is out of proportion with the risk, says Gardner. If you told people you were afraid to go outside because a meteor might hit you, they would wonder about your sanity. Yet the nightly news often breathlessly recounts shocking scenarios that are almost as unlikely to happen.</p>
<p>Our culture is constantly churning up urgent, ancient blinding fears, says Gardner, that often steal our attention from real broader problems like poverty, sustainability and climate change.</p>
<p>"We live in the information age, but our brains are from the Stone Age," he says</p>
<p>Gardner says the human brain "is one of the wonders of the universe." Our rational mind senses the magic of being alive in this day and age, but our fear network routinely rains on our parade.</p>
<p>So how do you get rid of fear? Well here's one way.</p>
<p>In 1995, a group of researchers at UCLA had opened the skull of a 16-year-old girl, an epileptic. The neurosurgeons were applying current to the left frontal lobe of her brain, to see if they could induce an epileptic seizure for research purposes. Suddenly to their shock the young girl burst out laughing.</p>
<p>The neurosurgeons were stunned. Up to that point, the young girl had been naturally intimidated and fearful of the huge team of grim-looking scientists who had her brain cut open under the glaring lights of an operating theatre.</p>
<p>"The laughter was accompanied by a sense of merriment and mirth," wrote neurosurgeon Itzhak Fried in the Science Journal Nature. Each time current was applied at a particular point, the girl would laugh, sometimes with explosive energy. The bewildered scientists observed that her reactions dissolved her fear and discomfort, and seemed to make everything "funny." It's as if they had discovered the "fun switch" inside her head.</p>
<p>At one point the girl began laughing at the befuddled surgeons themselves. "You guys are just so funny standing around," she said.</p>
<p>While this was seen as kind of bizarre event in neuroscience and filed away, it may point to an amazing new view of the brain. The way our brains react to things colours our world. Even though we live on a relatively docile planet, our culture, especially our news, is often inexplicably violent and depressive. We may not be actually dealing with reality but feeding paranoid brains. And we simply don't yet have the tools for countering the fear wave.</p>
<p>According to Gardner, the traditional antidote to fear is reason, but sadly it's a poor opponent. Reason always takes a beating from fear because according to Gardner, the two parts of our brain work at different speeds. Brain scans can see this process taking place. Our amygdala can make us jump in an instant; reason, meanwhile, is slow and plodding and only catches up when fear is finished freaking out. This seems to be true not only inside the brain but in the public arena as well.</p>
<p>The irony here is while the amygdala is supposed to be protecting us, it may be turning us into the character in the horror movie who runs screaming into the arms of the killer. It amplifies our vulnerabilities and inflates our enemies. Terrorists become shadowy supermen - until they're caught with malfunctioning bombs in their underpants and revealed to be the sexually frustrated losers and nincompoops they are. In fact, thanks to the underwear bomber, it's finally OK to make fun of terrorists, which shows how in thrall we've been - as if saying something bad about a terrorist, might mean you'll be found and killed. In Pakistan, which has a horrific terrorism problem, terrorists are becoming unprecedented comic fodder with a new televised comedy segment, the T (Taliban) Channel, devoted to these infamous, murderous fear merchants.</p>
<p>Back in safer North America, our amygdalas may be slowly killing us, pumping us full of stress hormones like cortisol, hardening our arteries, and aging us prematurely. Since the game is about staying alive, is there another way?</p>
<p>A less considered antidote to fear is fun, of course. Play behaviours themselves change brain chemistry, but they have an unexplained way of trivializing paranoia and fear. While there certainly is a fear network in our brains, there also seems to be a fun network.</p>
<p>New studies of play prove that play isn't just about horsing around, it's about adapting and problem solving. Play and fun drive curiosity, adventure and imagination. Humans rule the Earth because we are likely the planet's greatest adapters and play is about adapting to a changing world. And there is now some evidence that fun may help insure long-term survival in ways ye old amygdala can't.</p>
<p>During the televised auditions for American Idol this week, a character named "General" Larry Pratt put on show-stopping performance. Pratt, at 62, is not allowed to even compete in the show - the cut-off age for Idol is absurdly 28. Pratt sang an original song called Pants on the Ground, telling young urban hipsters to stop acting like fools and "pull up their pants." To the apparent horror of the judges, at one point, the energized Pratt started breakdancing and dropped to the ground into the splits. Despite noted crank Simon Cowell's attempts to halt him, Pratt's enthusiasm and vivacity has struck a chord to say the least. Pratt's song has become a major hit, with Pratt reputedly entertaining record deals while the Internet is already populated with widely popular remixes of his song. Fox News declared "Pants on the Ground Mania."</p>
<p>Pratt is a weird demonstration that youthful play behaviours can be extended indefinitely, something scientists say may be unique to our species and those who live with us, like dogs. Once upon a time, Pratt would have been admonished for not acting his age. Now science suggests by breakdancing at 62, he may be on to something.</p>
<p>Ellen Langer, a Harvard University psychologist, has just released Counterclockwise, a book based on a remarkable anti-aging experiment she conducted back in 1979. Her study is now getting so much interest that a Hollywood movie is being shot of her story, with Jennifer Aniston playing Langer.</p>
<p>The researcher took two groups of men, in their late seventies and eighties, to a monastery in Peterborough, N.H. Langer said she worried the men "would keel over" before her experiment was done. One group of eight men was instructed to live as most of us normally do, worrying about their health and declining years and letting nursing aides take care of them. The other group was enlisted to play a bizarre game: They were told to behave as if it was 20 years ago and they lived in a part of the monastery that had been renovated to look as if it was 1959, with added décor, furniture and era appropriate music. The experiment was setting the clock back. Nat King Cole was piped in on speakers and Ed Sullivan aired on TV in black and white. The men were encouraged to serve meals and help clean up. The men argued about baseball, debated politics and horsed around. They basically failed to "act their age. "</p>
<p>Following the experiment, the men were put through a battery of tests. While both groups seemed to benefit from the experience, the group that went back in time appeared rejuvenated - they put on pounds, their joints became more flexible, and some of their fingers lengthened due to an apparent lessening of arthritis. People who looked at photos of the counter-clockwise men thought they looked younger. Langer said toward the end of the experiment, she found herself playing touch football with some of her subjects.</p>
<p>In an interview Langer explained: "It's play. When you're having fun, you're being in the present and that's the secret," she said. "That's the core of it. Being in the present and mindful of what is happening now."</p>
<p>Langer says her experiment shows how our minds affect our bodies, and is being heralded as a possible anti-aging breakthrough. Langer's theory echoes many new age philosophies although Langer backs up her theories with peer-reviewed neuroscience. Playing in the moment seems to rejuvenate people; while those who act their age, dwell on fear, and worry about things that might never happen, seem to age.</p>
<p>Dr. Stuart Brown, author of the seminal book, Play, points out a little known factor about the importance of play in humans and why it may contribute to our longevity. While many other animals play, few play into adulthood, and virtually none to the extent that we do.</p>
<p>"We are designed by nature and evolution to continue playing throughout life," he writes.</p>
<p>It may be no accident that we benefit from keeping play in our lives. Like fear, play is essential to keeping us alive particularly when it comes to adapting to changing circumstances. While fear may protects us from harm. Fun and play keep us in the game in a rapidly changing world.</p>
<p>It may be that when play is withdrawn, humans start winding down, and generalized fear can be the switch.</p>
<p>"Older persons' irrational fear of crime leads to overreaction in their behaviour," according to Leslie Morgan and Suzanne Kunkel in their book Aging, Society, and the Life Course.</p>
<p>"Fear of crime can be paralyzing to older persons and can have significant negative effects and consequences for quality of life. Fear often leads elderly people to bar their doors and windows, avoid going out after dark and experience high anxiety during forays outside their homes. What is responsible for these high levels of fear?"</p>
<p>While the authors speculate, I have one suggestion - the news.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, a University of Brussels study published in the journal Aging International states that for the elderly: "Watching television correlates to an increased fear of crime while the daily reading of a newspaper decreases fear of it." This may be simply because TV with its direct visual nature goes straight to the fear network, while reading forces you to the reasoning side of the brain.</p>
<p>Fear is competitive business. Studies on monkeys indicate that when you damage their amygdalas, it reduces aggression and the monkeys lose social rank. In the fear game, this might explain why politicians must keep up with the fear mongers or risk losing status. This might have been at play when U.S. politicians announced the imposition of controversial full body scanners at airports. Canadian politicians immediately followed suit for fear of not looking paranoid enough.</p>
<p>So if our amygdalas are holding us back what are the alternatives?</p>
<p>Intriguingly, at the other end of our brain there's something called the ventral medial pre-frontal cortex. This part of the brain is the subject of research at MindSign Neuromarketing a private San Diego-based outfit that specializes in neural research for Hollywood studios. MindSign claims it's one of the few places that really has fun with brain scans because they're the only ones outside a university with their own mammoth fMRI scanner. They say they've localized the "fun centre." It's around the ventral medial pre-frontal cortex, says Philip Carlsen a researcher with MindSign</p>
<p>"There is no one fun area in the brain," says Carlsen. "But we do see a concentration there when people are really enjoying themselves."</p>
<p>MindSign has scanned the brains of people watching the trailer for Avatar, for example. As the camera approaches the unsettling image of a massive sleeping alien, the amygdala fires up, networking fear reactions all over the brain. However, as the trailer continues and we see incredible landscapes, spaceships, exotic creatures and the remarkable adventure unfolds, the "fun centre" comes to life.</p>
<p>Amazingly our fear network, the amygdala is in one of the oldest parts of our brain. One we share with reptiles and fish. The fun centre is almost at the exact other end, in the very newest part.</p>
<p>Fun, it appears, is where we're going. We just have to make sure we get there.</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu forced almost one in 10 Canadians to take time off work in November, Statistics Canada says, possibly putting a modest damper on the country's already weak recovery.</p>
<p>The agency said yesterday that 9 per cent of workers between the ages of 15 and 69 called in sick at some point in November because of the seasonal or H1N1 flu, which caused a frenzy of lineups for vaccinations last fall.</p>
<p>Measured by work hours lost – about 30 million – Statscan said the impact of the flu in November was greater than the blow from the massive blackout that hit Ontario and part of Quebec in the summer of 2003.</p>
<p>The power outage, which left major cities in darkness and stopped Toronto streetcars in their tracks, caused Canada's gross domestic product to shrink by 0.9 per cent in one month.</p>
<p>Phillip Cross, Statscan's chief economic analyst, said the country's flu sick days clearly had an effect on economic growth. But how much is hard to say.</p>
<p>Some economists are now revising their predictions for November's GDP growth based on yesterday's flu numbers. Canadian GDP rose a tepid 0.2 per cent in October, the last month for which statistics are available.</p>
<p>“When you start comparing this to the electrical blackout, that's going to get people's attention,” Mr. Cross said.</p>
<p>He said it was unlikely the economy would suffer as it did in the blackout.</p>
<p>“It's certainly going to have a dampening impact,” Mr. Cross said. “There's no question of that. The question is how much?”</p>
<p>Derek Burleton, an economist with <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> in Toronto, said he didn't believe the flu absenteeism would have a “significant impact.”</p>
<p>He pointed out that Statscan does not have flu numbers from previous Novembers to compare the impact.</p>
<p>Many large employers had prepared themselves for a much more serious flu pandemic, with health agencies predicting that a third or more of their work forces could be absent.</p>
<p>Vancouver-based <span class="companylink">Telus Corp</span>., which started planning for a pandemic in the wake of the 2003 SARS outbreak, says it had no abnormal spike in the usual absenteeism in November.</p>
<p>Spokesman Shawn Hall said the company's moves to provide employees with the latest updates from health authorities on the flu helped. “Constant communication … took out the hysteria and the misinformation that was out there.”</p>
<p>The company did not have to enact plans that would have seen 18,000 of its 35,000 employees work from home to stop the spread of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Statscan's report yesterday also said women and workers with children were more likely to miss work because of the flu. The lost work hours were partly offset by an extra 8.6 million in overtime hours. Health workers, not surprisingly, were the most likely to report working extra time.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Layoffs have not been a part of the budgetary process at Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health for many years. That changed this week.</p>
<p>Dr. Nicola Mercer, the medical officer of health, said funding reductions from the province, as well as increased program, facility and staffing costs, have forced the public health unit to let three nurses go, along with a dietician and eight other staff members across the organization, in an effort to trim about $600,000 from a budget facing severe constraints.</p>
<p>The health unit approved a budget of $16.2 million, representing an increase of 5.2 per cent for 2010. The organization needed a nine per cent increase to provide the same level of services as in 2009.</p>
<p>"The entire agency is grieving the loss of people they have worked with, some for quite a number of years," said Mercer. "Our agency has not laid off anybody for more than 15 years. That is because we would try to accommodate it by not replacing someone who retired or left voluntarily. So this process for us is unusual and not something we're used to."</p>
<p>Mercer said the agency will do all it can to address public health needs that arise, including mobilizing appropriate resources in the event of a health-care emergency, of which there have been several in recent years.</p>
<p>Public money is expected to be tight for a number of years, so transfer payments to public agencies, including public health, will likely be restrained for some time to come, she predicted.</p>
<p>The nurses and dietician worked in the child and family health division, primarily in the popular Healthy Babies Healthy Children program, which offers pre- and post-birth programs for new mothers and their infants.</p>
<p>Mercer said the layoff of three full-time equivalent nurses represented an 11 per cent reduction in nurse staffing hours in the program, while the loss of the dietician is a 25 per cent reduction in dietician hours in the program.</p>
<p>While the Healthy Babies Healthy Children program is 100 per cent funded by the province, its budget has not seen an increase for many years. The program has been supplemented through other public health funding envelopes to maintain service levels. Those envelopes now have no extra money in them due to lower transfer payments from the province or due to a transition to cost-sharing agreements for some programs that were once fully funded by the province.</p>
<p>"The majority of nursing positions that were lost can be directly attributed to this program not being funded over time," Mercer said.</p>
<p>Health-care crises, such as H1N1, SARS and the E. coli water contamination in Walkerton in 2000, necessitate an immediate and costly response on the part of public health. Mercer said the agency is trying to maintain those areas of the organization that deal with human health emergencies.</p>
<p>"I think that we will have to really evaluate our capacity; what things we can't do in the future if we have limited resources." she said. "And we may be required to hire individuals at the time of emergencies that may not be as experienced because they are not working for us all the time. We may have to use more short-term or contract work in the event of a large human health emergency."</p>

<p>Cheap jewelry to be tested for cadmium</p>
<p>Health Canada says it is going to start sampling and testing children's jewelry to see if it contains cadmium. The department says it is concerned cadmium, which is a carcinogen, may be finding its way into cheap jewelry as a substitute for lead, which is also a health hazard. A recent investigation in the United States by the Associated Press news agency found a fair proportion of children's jewelry imported from China contained cadmium.</p>

<p>Appeal to close injection site fails</p>
<p>Canada's attorney general and minister of health have lost their appeal of a court ruling on Vancouver's controversial supervised injection site, raising proponents' hopes that similar facilities will now open in other cities. The B.C. Appeal Court rejected Ottawa's appeal in a two- to one split ruling announced Friday. Montaner said he's had discussions with officials in Montreal, Toronto, Victoria and San Francisco about those cities having their own clinics modelled after Insite.</p>

<p>Critics decry security certificate system</p>
<p>Supporters of Mohamed Harkat are calling for abolition of the security certificate system. The pleas come on the eve of court hearings that will decide whether the Algerian-born man is deported on a certificate due to alleged terrorist ties. Opponents say the certificate process is unfair because detainees are not given full details of the allegations against them. A case involving Montrealer Adil Charkaoui, a native of Morocco, recently fell apart when the government withdrew supporting evidence.</p>

<p>Politician taken to jail in spending scandal</p>
<p>The last former Newfoundland and Labrador politician to be sentenced in the legislature spending scandal was taken to jail in handcuffs Friday, closing a dark chapter in the province's political history. Ex-NDP member Randy Collins, the fourth politician convicted in a scandal that touched all parties, was given a 21-month jail term in a sentence that the Crown said was just. Collins pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling in an affair that overhauled how political expense claims are tracked in the province. According to an agreed statement of facts, Collins was illegally paid almost $140,000 for phoney and duplicate receipts from 1999 to 2006 - nearly his entire political career.</p>

<p>A criminal allegation against Ontario Provincial Police Commissioner Julian Fantino was put over Friday until next month. "It's clear the Crown was going to stay the charge today, there's no other reason to bring (the hearing) forward," activist Gary McHale said after the proceedings. "They knew they wouldn't get away with it so therefore they had to adjourn it for Feb. 3. There's absolutely no doubt in my mind that the Crown has no intention of prosecuting this case." The Crown asked the court Friday for more time to review new evidence relating to the allegations that Fantino influenced or attempted to influence municipal officials. It said the extra time was necessary before it can decide whether to go ahead with the charges on Feb. 3.</p>

<p>StatsCan says flu cost 21 million hours</p>
<p>Statistics Canada estimates that nearly 21 million hours of work were lost in November due to the flu. It says 1.5 million employed people reported they were absent from work that month as a result of the H1N1 flu or seasonal flu. That's roughly nine per cent of all working people between the ages of 15 and 69. In the same month, 600,000 people put in 8.6 million extra hours at work as a result of the flu but the net effect was a loss of 20.9 million hours in November.</p>

<p>Police say it was "by the grace of God" no one was hit when several bullets were fired into a home in east-end Toronto.

A woman was in the living room and her daughter in a bedroom at the time, but neither was hurt.</p>

</p>
<p>New Energy Minister Ron Liepert stepped back from comments made this week about changing the government's "come-one, come-all" attitude toward oilsands development.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, after Premier Ed Stelmach's revamped cabinet was sworn in, Liepert talked about his own comments published Friday in which he mentioned a possible shift from uncontrolled oilpatch growth.</p>
<p>On Friday, he said the business slowdown in the last year has allowed "a hiatus in rapid development in the oilsands," which in turn should prompt discussion of matching community infrastructure to business growth.</p>
<p>"All I'm suggesting is we need to talk about and think about ... two and three years down the road, when development picks up again," Liepert said, adding he is not discussing any government intervention in the industry.</p>
<p>"I don't think we're offside with industry."</p>
<p>Liepert was once a communications director for former Alberta premier Peter Lougheed, who has said oilsands growth should be slowed down.</p>
<p>"There won't be any calls to change," Stelmach said Friday. The goal, he said, is to keep up the pace of infrastructure in the oilpatch to match business development.</p>
<p>Officials in the oil and gas industry have, so far, applauded Liepert's move to the energy portfolio from health. Liepert is a Calgary MLA expected to spend time wooing oil executives in the city's Petroleum and Ranchmen's clubs.</p>
<p>What appeared to be the minister back-tracking also looked like a muddled message on Friday, when Stelmach was touting his new roster of cabinet ministers as great communicators.</p>
<p>New cabinet ministers Thomas Lukaszuk and Jonathan Denis are seen by some as communicators. Denis, an MLA from Calgary, regularly talks to constituents on social media websites such Twitter, while Lukaszuk has often stood as an Edmonton voice in news stories when cabinet ministers were unavailable.</p>
<p>Lukaszuk, the MLA for Edmonton-Castle Downs, is the new minister of employment and immigration; Denis is now minister of housing and urban affairs; and Peace River MLA Frank Oberle is the new solicitor general.</p>
<p>During the ceremony, Minister of Advanced Education Doug Horner took the oath of office as deputy premier.</p>
<p>In a bit of ceremonial levity, new Health Minister Gene Zwozdesky finished his oath with an additional "please" for God.</p>
<p>"There's pressure in any portfolio," he said later, noting he is now responsible for the chunk of government work that accounts for nearly 35 per cent of Alberta's annual provincial budget.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess I would say that any time you've got the opportunity to seek advice from a higher power, then you should take it," Liepert said.</p>
<p>Stelmach's government has taken a great deal of heat in recent months for its health-care policies. Under Liepert's hand, the province folded its 12 regional health boards into a single superboard. Political opponents have also lined up criticism against the province's handling of the H1N1 vaccine rollout and plans to close beds at Alberta Hospital Edmonton.</p>

<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper gave Canada's beleaguered public service a rare pat on the back Friday, praising bureaucrats for a "good year" and for their integrity in rolling out the economic stimulus package, H1N1 vaccination campaign and now disaster relief for Haiti's earthquake victims.</p>
<p>Harper delivered his praise at Rideau Hall Friday while handing out the outstanding achievement award to several senior bureaucrats for their work in security, health and justice -- considered priority issues for the Conservatives .</p>
<p>"I would like to conclude today by thanking all members of the public service for their hard work over the past year," said Harper. "It has been a very good year for the public service, a wide range of departments and agencies co-ordinated and rolled out in record time and with high levels of success unprecedented measures that have served Canada very well during the global economic recession."</p>
<p>The accolades come when the country's public service feels besieged. It was a year that saw political attacks on diplomat Richard Colvin and other heads of agencies that ran afoul of the government.</p>

<div>INTERVIEW / FLORIN DIACU ON MEGADISASTERS</div>
<div>Focus</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Experts say they may never be able to predict earthquakes the way they do hurricanes. But we can be better prepared</b>
</div><div>JEET HEER   </div>
<div>956 words</div><div>16 January 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>F7</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Mathematician Florin Diacu is the author of Megadisasters: The Science of Predicting the Next Catastrophe. Born in Romania, Prof. Diacu “lived through several earthquakes” there, and now teaches at the University of Victoria: “I moved from one earthquake zone to another.”</p>
<p>What are some of the limits of prediction? You suggest that earthquakes are much harder to predict than most other types of disasters.</p>
<p>With hurricanes, we are doing quite well these days. But with earthquakes or tsunami, most of which are generated by earthquakes, we are not doing as well. The main reason for that is that we don't really know the exact position of the tectonic plates. The global positioning system allows us to do better measurements. However, we are still far from understanding how the plates work.</p>
<p>The experts are divided about whether we'll be able to predict earthquakes soon. Some think that we won't ever be able to make precise predictions. Others think that the time may come.</p>
<p>Of course, what people want would be to know very clearly on that day at that time in that region when an earthquake of that magnitude will take place. Well, something like that we obviously cannot do and probably will never be able to do. But we can tell that during certain periods of time earthquakes will be more likely in certain regions.</p>
<p>Discussing the famous tsunami of 2004, you say: “The saddest part of the story is that most of the lives could have been saved.” How could people prepare for something so sudden?</p>
<p>There is story in the book about a 10-year-old English girl who recognized the signs of an incoming tsunami and alerted her parents. The parents talked to a lifeguard, who evacuated the beach. About 100 people were saved just because a little girl recognized the signs and did the right thing. You see, tsunamis don't come all of the sudden. We have some warnings. Sometimes the warning is only a few minutes, sometimes half an hour. For instance, the water recedes or becomes bubbly and frothy, like on top of a beer. There are other signs: if the water stings the skin or the sea smells of rotten eggs or oil, or a boom is followed by a whistle or a jet-plane or helicopter-like noise. Once you have seen a documentary showing these signs, you recognize them.</p>
<p>But society can also prepare. In North America, we have a very well-established warning system. If a big earthquake that can generate a tsunami takes place near Japan, we would know on the West Coast right away. The same should have happened in the Indian Ocean in 2004. An earthquake took place off the coast of Indonesia, and people should have been warned. And that's why I said most of those lives could have been saved.</p>
<p>Do you think the real message of the book is that prevention is the best medicine, not only for health but also for disasters?</p>
<p>Definitely. Earthquakes don't kill people. The houses that collapse on people kill them. The first thing is to impose building codes in areas prone to earthquakes so that the risk is minimal. No place on Earth is safe from earthquakes; still, there are zones where they are more likely.</p>
<p>It's not just about earthquakes. One example I wrote about regards collisions with asteroids or comets. Until now, we could not have defended ourselves from such a cosmic impact. What we can do these days is, when we find out an asteroid is likely to hit us one or two years from now, either destroy it with atomic weapons or use some other method to try to deviate [it]. Because, if you nudge it just a little bit now, a couple of years from now, it will move a lot on a different orbit and away from us.</p>
<p>All I'm saying is that we really need to look around, invest the money in the right science [and] make this a safer world.</p>
<p>Isn't there a tendency in humanity to pooh-pooh danger?</p>
<p>Many more people die in car accidents every year than people die in tsunamis or in earthquakes. However, when such things happen, then you are sorry that you didn't do anything to prevent it. So, of course, we can lie to ourselves and say we shouldn't worry about these things. But I don't think that's the right approach. Even though these events are rare, when they come, they make a lot of damage and suffering. A lot of people die.</p>
<p>Isn't there a danger in raising too much of an alarm too often, as in the boy who cried wolf?</p>
<p>Definitely. This is not a scientific problem. This is a media problem. With H1N1, the coverage of this issue was way out of proportion. But the vaccine had an impact in not allowing the disease to spread. We don't know how things would have been, had we not been vaccinated.</p>
<p>So you're advocating preparation and education.</p>
<p>It's not difficult to get prepared. It's not difficult to be aware. The 10-year-old English girl was a child and she was able to recognize something nobody else recognized. If we just present children with all the possible dangers and what to do about them, it is much better than if you don't know anything about these things. It's not difficult.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hotels in Euro hotspots cool, charming, and cheap; Finding off-season bargains in Venice, Lisbon</b>
</div><div>Tony Wong   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>791 words</div><div>16 January 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>T10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>VENICE -- It's a lot colder, and you're bound to get a few wet days. But Europe in the off-season has a few big things going for it: fewer crowds and much cheaper accommodation.</p>
<p>Venice in the summer can be a grind, especially when navigating cruise line-bound luggage over ancient foot bridges.</p>
<p>In winter, it's much more manageable and so are the hotel prices for one of the most expensive tourist spots in the world. An economic crisis, a lack of American tourists, and H1N1 fears have conspired to keep things affordable.</p>
<p>Some argue the city on the water is even more romantic during the winter months, as a fine mist descends over the canals.</p>
<p>We stayed in a 15th century palazzo for 100 euros per night (about $160 Cdn), all taxes in, a true bargain. Ca Gottardi has style, location and views at an eminently reasonable price when the crowds are gone.</p>
<p>Owned by the family of a former gondolier, the tiny 10-room hotel is sumptuously renovated with exquisite Murano glass, Venetian chandeliers and ornate linens and tapestries in the rooms.</p>
<p>Our room had two windows, revealing bridge and canal views in the main building. There is also a separate building. Try to stay in the main if you can, but both buildings have plenty of charm.</p>
<p>The front door is hidden away on a main street. Outside, the building looks every bit of five centuries old, but inside it's totally renovated, starting with a solid Carrara marble and glass floating staircase that takes you to the lobby. The service is discreet, personal, and kind.</p>
<p>The breakfast, including pretty, divine chocolate croissants, is a true bonus. This is a truly romantic, bite-sized hotel in one of the world's loveliest cities at an incredible price during the winter months.</p>
<p>Outside the hotel is the Strada Nuovo, one of the city's main streets. It's about a 15-minute walk to St. Mark's Square.</p>
<p>In Lisbon, meanwhile, the streets of the legendary Bairro Alto neighbourhood seem deserted at dinner time.</p>
<p>Touts hand out ads for Fado music demonstrations and offers of hash abound.</p>
<p>Nearby in Rossio Square, we stayed at the Internacional Design Hotel for an astounding 80 euros ($128) per night, all taxes in. The newly renovated century-old building is just over a year old and overlooks the busiest square in Portugal's capital city.</p>
<p>Unlike the Ca Gottardi, which is a traditional boutique hotel in the style of Toronto's Windsor Arms, the Internacional Design takes its cues from the father of boutique hotels, Ian Schrager.</p>
<p>His witty collaborations with French designer Phillipe Starck have produced vibrant, colourful interiors with a sense of humour in his New York hotels.</p>
<p>The rather earnestly named Internacional Design hotel tries to do Starck one step further, by having four different floors, each representing a different motif.</p>
<p>Pop rooms are a riff on Andy Warhol, including pink toilet paper.</p>
<p>Tribu rooms are about animal prints, while urban rooms are edgier.</p>
<p>We decided our vacation was chaotic enough, so we settled on a Zen room with soothing beige and white tones and seashells.</p>
<p>Like the Gottardi, the hotel is family-owned, which probably explains the pride of ownership and the friendly service.</p>
<p>Hotel amenities include bathrobes and a very cool, free, espresso machine in the room - more than you could ask for from a modern budget hotel in the middle of the action.</p>
<p>While the hotel has a very upscale vibe, the family which owns it remains true to their roots as hostel owners, making the property accessible to backpackers and business folk.</p>
<p>However, because you are downtown, it's almost impossible to drown out the street noise from trams and people heading to work in the morning, although that's part of the fun of living in downtown Lisbon.</p>
<p>The hotel could also use a few blackout drapes for sleeping - this is not the ideal spot for airline crew on layover.</p>
<p>Summer rates typically start at 250 euros ($400 Cdn) per night.</p>

<p>The Saskatoon Roman Catholic diocese has restored practices it suspended in October to stop the spread of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The diocese established a number of protocols last year: Communion from the common cup was suspended, along with the exchange of the Sign of Peace, baptism by immersion and handshakes.</p>
<p>Reception of communion on the tongue will no longer be discouraged and holy water will again be placed at church entrances.</p>
<p>The diocese urges people attending church to continue practising good hygiene -- including regular hand washing and the use of sanitizer -- to minimize the spread of cold and flu viruses.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon diocese includes 98 parishes in urban and rural communities.</p>

<p>(From the National Post, January 16, 2010) In the Buy & Sell column with Larry Jeddeloh yesterday, the weights and positions were incorrectly identified as being those of the fund. These weights and positions are those of TIS Group's Global research model and may not be those of the Omega Global Opportunities Fund. ***** </p>
<p>Larry Jeddeloh has been bullish on both gold and oil for a long time. In fact, the founder and chief investment officer of Minnesota-based TIS Group, which acts as sub-advisor for the Omega Global Opportunities Fund, says bullion will likely rise to US$3,878 per ounce -- but it might take eight or nine years to get there.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Jeddeloh felt the gold price overshot a bit when it got to US$1,226 recently. He looks for gold exposure primarily through equities and his current global research model targets a tactical weight of more than 10%. Jeddeloh has been looking for gold to come down to about US$1,030 before adding to his position, and the manager is seeing buy signals again.</p>
<p>"It looks to us like the correction is over," he says. "The deterioration in the U.S. dollar that took place last year, we thought we'd get a hiatus and see some dollar strengthening. We're not getting it right now."</p>
<p>Jeddeloh, whose Market Intelligence Report is distributed to advisors and institutions with approximately $360-billion in assets under management, thinks the re-acceleration of the downward dollar trade is beginning.</p>
<p>One reason he cites is the U.S. Treasury's recent decision to lift the US$400-billion cap off losses it would take on Fannie Macand <span class="companylink">Freddie Mac</span>, which was established when they were put into conservatorship last year. The manager feels this opens up the Treasury to almost unlimited losses for several years.</p>
<p>"I don't think they would have done that unless they're anticipating putting a lot more money out to cover those losses," he says.</p>
<p>"We think there is a big money print coming here. This is another example of the fiscal deterioration in the United States."</p>
<p>Either they print the money or raise it in the capital markets. Regardless, it is very bearish for the U.S. dollar, the manager notes. And with U.S. midterm elections coming in November, Jeddeloh expects the government will put more money in the hands of voters. So while the current discussion centres around tightening credit, he wonders if circumstances will force U.S. monetary authorities to go back to quantitative easing.</p>
<p>"They might have to go back and actually start reflating again, well before anybody thought," the manager says. "When the market gets a hold of that, then I think the U.S. dollar starts down again and you get commodity prices across the board, including gold and oil, starting to run."</p>
<p>Jeddeloh expects oil to rise above US$100 per barrel in 2010, partly because of the global economic recovery and also due to geopolitical issues.</p>
<p>"We wouldn't be surprised at all if some of the Western countries were involved, for instance, in trying to destabilize Iran and turn over the regime -- which by the way is not bearish for oil. This is going to be the year when Iran is going to come to a head."</p>
<p>jratner@nationalpost.com---</p>
<p>- The positions discussed above and the weights used for the global research model may not be those of the Omega Global Opportunities Fund.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>BUYS</p>
<p>CHAODA MODERN AGRICULTURE (HOLDINGS) LTD. (0682/HKG)</p>
<p>Jeddeloh recently added this Chinese company to the portfolio, which is growing at 20% with a P/E ratio of just 4x. The Hong Kong-based organic farming company controls the entire process in fruit and vegetable production, from seeds to marketing.</p>
<p>"A lot of Chinese land has been under cultivation for centuries and is tired," he says. "The nutrients aren't there, so in a way, they are trying to replenish the land."</p>
<p>Chaoda is also actively working with the government to introduce vaccines directly into plants. Jeddeloh notes that its effort to do this with the H1N1 vaccine has won the support of authorities, who say it won't be regulated as a drug.</p>
<p>"Although I don't know if they can export that kind of product, they've got a billion potential customers inside China for it."YS</p>
<p>ISHARES FTSE/XINHUA CHINA 25 INDEX ETF (FXI/NYSE)</p>
<p>Asian equities and ETFs represent the largest position in fund.</p>
<p>"If the U.S. economy continues to recover, that helps their export markets dramatically," says Jeddeloh. "So Asia is really a warrant on recovery in the rest of the world in terms of growth."</p>
<p>He notes that the Chinese economy is going to grow at least 10% this year and stocks appear to be reversing upwards again.</p>
<p>"They are going to have probably the best growth rate of all the major developed or developing markets again this year," the manager says.</p>
<p>He also notes that according to the Big Macindex, China's currency is undervalued by 48%. Someday, Jeddeloh is confident that will change.</p>
<p>"Basically, I'm buying very high growth in a currency that appears to be very undervalued."</p>
<p>IPATH MSCI INDIA INDEX ETN (INP/NYSE)</p>
<p>This exchange-traded note represents about 8% of the fund and reflects Jeddeloh's view that India is a better story than China in some respects. He notes that the country uses British law and structures, offers strong accounting systems, and has a very large population that is becoming very well educated.</p>
<p>"I think India is very unique situated in-between the Middle East and the Chinese," the manager says.</p>
<p>He also notes that it should grow well in excess of 5% annually for several years and will likely demonstrate better fiscal discipline than China.</p>
<p>"It is kind of a unique situation in that they are building up internally, but they are also becoming a preferred exporter for 21st century knowledge products."</p>
<p>Jeddeloh also notes that the fastest-growing area on the globe for inter-country trade is the India-China border.</p>
<p>"It is absolutely booming."</p>
<p>SELL</p>
<p>U.S. TREASURIES</p>
<p>Jeddeloh began playing this bearish view on U.S. government bonds through the ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury ETF (TBT/NYSE) about a month ago. The position represents about 10% of the fund.</p>
<p>"The problem comes back to supply," he says.</p>
<p>"Rates will likely start to rise, not just in the United States but just about everywhere else as investors start demanding more for putting their money in the government bond markets.</p>
<p>"The balance sheets of these governments are deteriorating almost across the board."</p>
<p>Jeddeloh also notes that bubbles such as this (involving low interest rates) tend to pop early in zero years such as 2010.</p>
<p>The manager plans to keep buying this ETF until 10-year bonds climb to about 4%, while he expects they will climb to 5% or 5.5% this year.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Chan's fortunes twist and turn as Olympics approach; Illness, injury, coaching change, relocation test Toronto teenager</b>

</p>
<p>Since life is a long program, there is the chance you miss your quad early and the whole thing goes sideways in a disappointing blur of popped Lutzes and loops.</p>
<p>The possibility also exists that you dust off your icy duff, soar through technically and artistically stunning triples, dance between them as if your pants are on fire, and bound to the top of the podium.</p>
<p>In the case of Toronto figure skater Patrick Chan, it's hard to know which way the winds of such constant and seemingly catastrophic change have buffeted him personally and professionally of late. His time-tested character says he'll fight through; the laundry list of distractions plays devil's advocate.</p>
<p>Because, when he mapped out the final stages of his Olympic preparation, it is safe to assume the plan did not include a suspected bout of H1N1, a debilitating calf muscle injury that caused him to miss a Grand Prix event in Russia, the uproar over the controversial doctor who treated him for it, a dismal performance at Skate Canada International and a last-minute coaching switcheroo that has him training in Colorado Springs at altitude with longtime choreographer Lori Nichol and Christy Krall rather than longtime coach Don Laws at sea level in Florida.</p>
<p>But nobody seems the slightest bit worried about the 19-year-old.</p>
<p>"I know he's a strong kid," said five-time Canadian women's champ Joannie Rochette.</p>
<p>"He's got a good team around him. And when you're an elite athlete you don't have to rely on your coach all the time. You have to be able to trust yourself. You're skating by yourself. He has good confidence. He'll be all right."</p>
<p>That Chan has spent the most important four months of his skating career in various states of reeling and recovery -- be it physical, mental or both -- cannot be denied. What he will show here in London at this week's Canadian figure skating championships is whether the rebound is real or only expected -- if, in fact, he is all right.</p>
<p>The first overt signal may well be his mastery, or lack of it, over the dreaded triple Axel. It had been the bane of his existence and was the focus of his work with Krall, who employs the Dartfish video system to analyze a skater's every move on the ice in ultra slow motion.</p>
<p>"Right away we found a lot of my original technique for the triple Axel was not that good," Chan said Thursday. "That was the big key. The consistency has skyrocketed since then. I treat the triple Axel more as another jump now."</p>
<p>He'll do two of them in the long program here Sunday, eschewing a quad toe that is still not good enough for prime time. He won't even commit to using it in Vancouver. His focus is on a long program balanced on a pair of perfect Axels.</p>
<p>"Until I can really do a good long program with two triple Axels consistently clean, then we'll talk about putting (the quad) in. It's a big choice to make."</p>
<p>A popped quad saps confidence, a fall is worse, so he's wary. After a lead-in like he has endured, there is no sense inviting more potential headaches when a sensible alternative awaits. It's a sign he is indeed thinking clearly up in the thin air of the Rockies.</p>
<p>"I think he's in a good place mentally and physically," said Mike Slipchuk, Skate Canada's director of high performance, who visited with Chan in Colorado Springs and saw him land a few quads in practice.</p>
<p>"With him, it's just been a bit of adversity. As long as he keeps it in perspective, he'll be better for it."</p>
<p>We'll see how that plays out. But win or lose in London, Chan is going to Vancouver.</p>
<p>Like Rochette, dancers Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir, and pairs team Jessica Dube and Bryce Davison, Chan's ticket has already been punched.</p>
<p>He and Skate Canada would naturally prefer he go not only as three-time defending Canadian champion, but fresh off a dominating performance which would bode well for his chances against American Evan Lysacek, Russian Evgeni Plushenko and Japan's Daisuke Takahashi.</p>
<p>There is no doubting Chan's willingness to climb this icy mountain of adversity in time to win an Olympic medal. He has long shown that steel isn't restricted to the blades on his skates, and he's putting in the work.</p>
<p>At Skate Canada International, his programs were under-trained because of the injury and he half expected to flop.</p>
<p>After placing sixth in a 12-man field in Kitchener, Skate Canada officials floated the idea of running through his programs in front of a judging panel prior to nationals. Chan said it would be a great idea, since, in his words, he could "catch up" to the six rivals who took their programs to the GP Final in Tokyo: Jeremy Abbott, Takahashi, Nobunari Oda, Johnny Weir, Lysacek and Brian Joubert.</p>
<p>But it never happened.</p>
<p>"We never did a competitive simulation," said Slipchuk.</p>
<p>"What they've been doing for close to a month is changing the pre-competition routine. He would do a warm-up, then wait for a period of time, get off the ice for 15 or 20 minutes as if he was skating third or fourth.</p>
<p>"By doing that, you simulate the competitive environment."</p>
<p>Doing it all in the rarefied air of Colorado Springs has been difficult but necessary, since he needed to work on stamina. He was totally bagged halfway through his long program in Kitchener and fatigue played a role in his undoing. He fell on a triple Axel and again on a triple Salchow in the second half of the skate.</p>
<p>After training so hard for so long to be ready, he said he was disappointed in his body.</p>
<p>He's 19. He'll get used to that. Starting today, he will shut out the distractions, call on his most recent body of training work and his mental toughness. He is happy with his preparation, his confidence level and his new training home and that's important, particularly since he won't compete again until Vancouver.</p>
<p>"If he's comfortable with the situation, he's the one skating," said Slipchuk. "He made the decision on who would be with him at the Olympics. We don't foresee this as a big change. Nobody new has been added to the mix. There were three people, now there are two."</p>
<p>Some observers see that change as its own distraction. Ironically, it is an important part of a coach's job to limit such things, particularly in an Olympic year.</p>
<p>"Oui, but at the same time they are adults," countered Manon Perron, Rochette's coach.</p>
<p>"You can give your opinion, but you can't run their life."</p>
<p>Like a long program, it will run its own course.</p>

<p>VIRTUE, MOIR FOLOW SCRIPT</p>
<p>LONDON, Ont. -Hometown favourites Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir stepped out to an expected lead after the compulsory dance at the Canadian figure skating championships Thursday.</p>
<p>Skating crisply to Tango Romantica, Virtue and Moir rolled up 43.98 points, good enough for a six-point lead on challengers Vanessa Crone and Paul Poirier.</p>
<p>In third spot at the John Labatt Centre are Kaitlyn Weaver and Andrew Poje.</p>
<p>By virtue (no pun intended) of their silver and bronze medals at the world championships in 2008 and 2009 respectively, Virtue and Moir are safely though unofficially through to the Olympics in Vancouver next month. The only real mystery remains who will join them when the team is named, officially, on Sunday night.</p>
<p>They are the two-time defending champs at this event and won both their Grand Prix competitions this season, at Skate Canada International in Kitchener and Trophee <span class="companylink">Eric Bompard</span> in Paris.</p>

<p>Stories Report on Business is following today:</p>
<p>JPMorgan profit surges</p>
<p>JPMorgan Chase & Co. continues what can only be considered a winning streak given the financial crisis. The Wall Street giant, which is stronger than its peers and never slipped into the red during the recession, said this morning its fourth-quarter profit surged to $3.28-billion (U.S.) or 74 cents a share from $702-million or 6 cents a year earlier. JPMorgan's fortunes have been largely pumped by a strong investment banking business, while its consumer business struggles with a tepid economic recovery. "While we are seeing some stability in delinquencies, consumer credit costs remain high, and weak employment and home prices persist," said chief executive officer Jamie Dimon. "Accordingly, we remain cautious." Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/jpmorgan-profit-soars-on-market-rally/article1432002/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/jpmorgan-profit-soars-on-market-rally/article1432002/])</p>
<p>Wall Street didn't get the memo</p>
<p>It would appear Wall Street hasn't got the message. Anger over big bonuses has spread across the globe, climaxing yesterday with President Barack Obama's new bank tax and fierce talk on how bankers can pay the special levy from their "obscene" bonuses if they don't like it. Today, the Wall Street Journal reports that the big U.S. banks and securities firms are poised to pay a record $145-billion (U.S.) in compensation for 2009. Basing its analysis on securities filings for the first nine months of the year and revenue estimates for the year, the newspaper said staff at 38 major financial institutions can expect to pull in almost 18 per cent more than a year earlier, which is also a bit more than 2007's record take.</p>
<p>That's sure to raise some eyebrows, particularly on the heels of bank bonuses taxes in Europe and Mr. Obama's plan to bring in $90-billion over about 10 years with his "financial crisis responsibility fee." As in: You caused it, you pay for it.</p>
<p>Some major players, such as Goldman Sachs Group, have adjusted their compensation schemes as fury, and unemployment, mount. Citigroup Inc., the Financial Times reports today, plans to cap cash bonuses at below $100,000.</p>

<p>London's mayor warns on bonus tax</p>
<p>London is still moaning about the British tax of 50 per cent on bank bonuses over £25,000. The city's mayor, Boris Johnson, sent treasury chief Alistair Darling a letter asking for a meeting amid fears that top talent will leave the country. "You have made unilateral changes to taxation that risk damaging London's competitiveness and its status, alongside New York, as the world's leading financial services center," Mr. Johnson's letter stated. "… The government is doing nothing more than fast-tracking the departure of this talent pool out of Britain and into the welcoming arms of our competitors."</p>
<p>What the flu cost the economy</p>
<p>The flu took a major toll on the economy in November. Statistics Canada said this morning that about 1.5 million workers called in sick in November because of the H1N1 or seasonal flu, roughly 9 per cent of the 15-69 aged work force. They accounted for almost 30 million lost work hours, though 600,000 people picked up 8.6 million extra hours, meaning an overall loss of about 21 million hours in the month. The hit, Statistics Canada said, was equal to that of the massive power outage in August, 2003. Absenteeism was highest in Newfoundland and Labrador, at 14.2 per cent, and lowest in Quebec, at 7.6 per cent. People with children lost far more time than those without.</p>
<p>December strong for home sales</p>
<p>The Canadian Real Estate Association this morning reported another strong month for the housing sector, as sales rose 72 per cent in December, albeit from a depressed state a year earlier. The showing is likely to fuel more talk of a bubble.</p>
<p>"After setting records, Canadian house prices took a hit only temporarily through last winter and spring, and then rebounded very quickly back to records or near-records depending on the measure," Scotia Capital said this morning, before the report was released. "Inflation-adjusted resale prices are at all-time record highs. The Canadian equivalent to the U.S. S&P/Case-Shiller [index] is rising but just shy of its record before the retrenchment and is up over 85 per cent on the past decade compared to the U.S. that climbed 100 per cent from 2000-2006. The fact that Canada took longer to climb by almost as much is hardly evidence that Canada doesn't have a bubble." An 85-per-cent rise in a single decade on a tax-sheltered investment has housing investment blowing most other asset classes totally out of the water."</p>

<p>Euro dips on Greece, Merkel</p>
<p>The euro fell sharply today as concerns over Greece's debt mess continued to ripple through markets and rumours spread that German Chancellor Angela Merkel might quit, which she dismissed as "absurdity." Note that she only recently won re-election. "I hope the right people made money and not the wrong ones," the German leader said in Berlin.</p>
<p>Cognac sales rebounding after the slump</p>
<p>Cole Porter may have been right when he wrote "You're the top! You're Napoleon Brandy." Presumably hit by the recession, global cognac sales fell more than 12 per cent last year, marking the second year in a row for falling sales. Sales fell 118 per cent in Europe, 10 per cent in eastern Asia and 9.2 per cent in North America. But demand is coming back, having jumped sharply in the fourth quarter of 2009.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WHO fights back over criticism that it exaggerated H1N1 threat</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO  </div>
<div>353 words</div><div>15 January 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- The H1N1 pandemic has returned – not necessarily in the number of people infected, but rather in the criticism being levelled at the World Health Organization for ostensibly exaggerating the threat.</p>
<p>The agency, however, is not taking the accusations lightly. Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's special adviser on pandemic influenza, came out swinging yesterday, saying such charges are scientifically inaccurate and reckless.</p>
<p>“The world is going through a real pandemic. The description of it as a fake is both wrong and is irresponsible,” Dr. Fukuda said in a conference call.</p>
<p>In recent days, the WHO has drawn criticism, primarily in Europe, that it allegedly colluded with pharmaceutical companies and overstated the threat of the H1N1 virus. The parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe will hold a debate on this at the end of the month, titled “Faked pandemics: a threat to health.” WHO officials have been asked to testify.</p>
<p>Dr. Fukuda disputed all charges yesterday.</p>
<p>The WHO, he said, has repeatedly stressed that the pandemic could range from mild to severe. Formally declaring H1N1 a pandemic was justified because of its global spread, and it allowed countries to put in place their pandemic preparedness plans to help mitigate H1N1's reach.</p>
<p>“WHO has always been very balanced and sober in providing its assessments. We have worked very hard to neither overplay nor underplay the situation.”</p>
<p>Further, he denied that the WHO was influenced by the pharmaceutical industry in declaring a pandemic.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada declined comment yesterday on Dr. Fukuda's assessment of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Perry Kendall, British Columbia's provincial health officer, said it is easy for people to be critical with the benefit of hindsight. He said the WHO may consider establishing a severity-level criteria alongside the pandemic phases.</p>
<p>“However, it is necessary to plan for worst-case scenarios, and had this been an H5 type virus – which we had been planning for [and dreading] or had H1N1 mutated or acquired virulence genes – we would not be regretting our urgency.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Meet the doc treating the frostbites and strains; From slippery conditions to giddy patriotism, Dr. Jane Moran helps at least one spectator get back on their feet every day</b>

</p>
<p>Carrying the Olympic flame is a relatively safe business thanks to tiny plastic nubs attached to the inside of torchbearer mittens.</p>
<p>This minor alteration to the common red Olympic mitts sold in stores means that Jane Moran, the relay team doctor who is following the flame on its route through Canada, hasn't had to treat anyone for torch burns.</p>
<p>Dr. Moran, the Olympic flame, and the 250-member crew she is charged with caring, rested yesterday in Edmonton as the relay took a day off. From her hotel room, the 57-year-old emergency physician recalled how her journey along the relay route has been dotted with everything from lacerations, muscle strains, colds and flu, frostbite and windburn.</p>
<p>But there's been nary a singed eyebrow.</p>
<p>“The torchbearer mittens are special mittens so they don't drop the torch,” she said.</p>
<p>Torch spotting is a far more hazardous sport.</p>
<p>A confluence of slippery conditions, snow banks, giddy patriotism and eyes cast toward the flame mean that Dr. Moran helps at least one spectator back to their feet every day.</p>
<p>“As we come along, some people are running to keep up to the torch and they fall and stumble or they get short of breath,” she said. “Some elderly people trying to keep up to their grandchildren and things like that, so I stop and assist them.”</p>
<p>Her work began even before the relay team left Victoria. In late October, as the flame made its way from Greece to Canada, the H1N1 pandemic had hit British Columbia hard and the vaccine wasn't due to be available until mid-November.</p>
<p>Dr. Moran, who is known to team members as “Dr. Jane,” contacted the province's health officials and outlined for them all the remote communities that the team would visit over the 106-day course of the relay. A crew of 12 nurses was assembled to help her inoculate the relay team.</p>
<p>“We did it not for the health of the team, but for the social responsibility of not taking H1N1, if any of us had it, into those rural communities,” she said.</p>
<p>Jeff Simpkins, an ultra-marathoner and sergeant with the Ontario Provincial Police, is part of the security detail that runs as many as 50 kilometres alongside the torch each day.</p>
<p>He has visited Dr. Moran's hotel room clinic three times along the route. His worst injury was the result of an ankle-twisting encounter with a pothole in the Niagara Region. In Toronto, Dr. Moran stitched up Sgt. Simpkins's right eyebrow after he bumped his head in his hotel room. And last week, when he collided with a car in Yorkton, Sask., she treated him for another head bump and a stiff neck.</p>
<p>“It's like being rich enough to have your own personal medical doctor,” he said. “… She's always with us and she's always smiling.”</p>
<p>When she's not touring the country, Dr. Moran is an emergency physician and a sports medicine consultant based in Victoria. She was raised in Walkerton, Ont., in a house across the street from a skating rink where she and her sister and six brothers used to spend their spare time.</p>
<p>“Sport's been a big part of my life,” she said.</p>
<p>Her Olympic experience began with Canada's first turn as a host country, at the 1976 summer Olympics in Montreal where she worked as a physiotherapist for the Canadian team. After medical school she served on the Canadian Olympic medical team in Albertville, France, in 1992, and in Lillehammer, Norway in 1994.</p>
<p>Dr. Moran was appointed to the International Skating Union. She has served the organization as a medical adviser in the last three Winter Olympics, and will do so again next month in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Touring the country with the torch has shown her that the softer, more couch-prone portion of Canada's population can be as passionate as its athletes.</p>
<p>“The interesting part of this job has been the people and the passion and the pride,” she said. “I've looked at the people of Canada when we go to the hamlets and to the cities, the passion and the pride that they have for this country is amazing.”</p>

<div>HAITI EARTHQUAKE / THE FALLOUT AT HOME</div>
<div>Globe Life</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Talking to your kids about disaster</b>
</div><div>SARAH BOESVELD AND DAVE MCGINN   </div>
<div>912 words</div><div>15 January 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L1</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>On Wednesday, disaster and wreckage dominated the front page of the newspaper that 12-year-old Jori usually glances at in the morning.</p>
<p>Her mom, Lesli Christianson-Kellow, knew the story of Haiti's devastating earthquake was one she'd have to explain to her daughter before she headed to school.</p>
<p>So the Calgary mom pointed out the map in the paper and explained the extent of the devastation and the fact that the country would be needing help in the coming days, weeks, months and onward.</p>
<p>“I wanted to give her some context because the kids will talk about it,” she says. “And if you don't give your kids some background, they'll get some weird stories.”</p>
<p>She remembers her daughter coming to her in peak of the H1N1 flu fury, concerned by rumours that many kids her age were dying from the virus.</p>
<p>Depending on the child and their age, talking to your kids about major world disasters in the news can help them understand what's going on, feel safe and arm them with the tools to help if they want to, experts say. But there's a fine line between freaking them out and making them feel confident.</p>
<p>“The first thing you have to do is acknowledge that it is awful,” says Kathy Lynn, a parenting speaker and author in Vancouver. “Don't try to sugarcoat it. They're seeing the pictures and they know it's not lovely. However, in any disaster, particularly under the age of 10, don't keep the TV on all day. We tend to get kind of mesmerized when there's something like that.”</p>
<p>Ms. Christian-Kellow is trying not to turn on the news, to protect her daughters Jori and Casey, 9, from the graphic images, ones even she would find difficult to take in.</p>
<p>“The news is just unpredictable on TV, you don't really know what they're going to show,” she says. “They need to know, but they're still kids.”</p>
<p>Still, parents shouldn't ignore the disaster in an effort to protect their kids since the story is discussed almost everywhere, says Kelly Moroz, a child psychologist and director of the Moroz Child Psychology Group in Calgary.</p>
<p>“We firmly believe that parents should be instigating conversation just to be checking the waters,” he says. “The last thing anyone should be doing is avoiding, especially when someone has seen pictures or heard about [an event], the worst thing possible is to put the fear up on a pedestal by avoiding it.”</p>
<p>To put a child's potentially racing imagination in check, parents can explain and illustrate the low likelihood of such a disaster happening here, Ms. Lynn says. “The reality is, in our cities, across Canada, our buildings are much more earthquake-proof, we're better ready to handle such a thing,” she says. “For the kids that truly need to know, show them things like if anything ever happened here, we have a water heater here completely full of fresh water, so we would have water for a long time.”</p>
<p>Parents can clearly explain the basics of the earthquake and the relief efforts, but may want to wait for follow-up questions from kids before divulging too much information that could only frighten or perplex them, she adds.</p>
<p>Some parents are talking with their very young children about the crisis by putting it in terms they can understand and avoiding the unnecessary gory details.</p>
<p>Molly Finlay, director of public relations at World Vision Canada, told her three-and-a-half-year-old daughter Georgia she had to go to work early on Wednesday morning because many people in a far away country were in trouble and others needed to hear about it.</p>
<p>The preschooler loves to help, so explaining the ways to do it was a good way to communicate the disaster, she says.</p>
<p>“I said ‘the ground shook in a town that's very far away and some of those houses fell down and in those houses there were families just like us,' ” she says. “I tried to get her to relate to them.”</p>
<p>In response, the toddler offered to donate her jacket. She peppered her mom with queries about how the houses would be rebuilt and if there were enough people to offer help.</p>
<p>Leslie Garrett and her family heard about the disaster while celebrating her son Spencer's ninth birthday Tuesday evening in London, Ont. She calmly discussed it with him and her other children Charlotte, 6 and Sophie, 11. Ms. Garrett, who writes on environmental issues, took the same approach she takes when talking with her kids about climate change.</p>
<p>“We just talked about Haiti, what a poor country it is. I explained that the building construction is very different from construction here and that it's very unlikely we'd have an earthquake,” the 45-year-old mom says. “Then I try to turn it into a ‘how do we feel empowered when faced with this' and it becomes ‘what action can I take to help mitigate damage?' ”</p>
<p>Their kids are taxed on their allowances – 25 per cent goes to a charity of their choice – so she expects the $30 leftover from their donation to an animal charity over the Christmas holidays will go toward a donation toward relief efforts in Haiti.</p>

</p>
<p>There's little flu to be found in Saskatchewan right now, but residents without an H1H1 shot should still get immunized, the province's chief medical health officer said Thursday.</p>
<p>"Pandemics in the past have always had a sting in the tail -- a third wave," Dr. Moira McKinnon told reporters.</p>
<p>"We think that we might not get the third wave if we have enough people immunized."</p>
<p>Nearly 50 per cent of the general population in Saskatchewan has received the H1N1 shot -- the highest rate in the prairies and among the best in the country, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>But a vaccination rate of 65 to 70 per cent would ideally be achieved, she said, noting shots are still available through the health regions by appointment.</p>
<p>British Columbia's vaccination is about 35 per cent, while some Atlantic provinces are between 60 and 70 per cent, McKinnon said.</p>
<p>In Saskatchewan, seven out of 10 primary school children are vaccinated but young men are the laggards.</p>
<p>Just 22 per cent of males between the ages of 18 and 34 have been vaccinated, compared to 39 per cent of females in that age range.</p>
<p>McKinnon was joined at the press conference by three members of the Regina Pats -- Garrett Mitchell, Matt Strueby and Colten Teubert -- who urged other young men to follow their lead and get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"We did it as a team ... it's not very painful," Teubert said.</p>
<p>He speculated that other young people may not have bothered to get the shot because of a "too cool factor," or because they just had other things on their mind.</p>
<p>"But I mean this is the real deal and I think we need to fight it. Go get your shot. Get off the couch, quit playing your video game and go get your shot," Teubert said.</p>
<p>Pregnant women and people with chronic health conditions should also make sure they get immunized, McKinnon added.</p>
<p>Vaccinations conducted on Saskatchewan First Nations were not included in the province's publicly released statistics, but McKinnon said the response on reserves has been "well above 60 per cent."</p>
<p>McKinnon said the H1N1 response has rung up a price tag of about $30 million, which is line with the provincial government's earlier projections.</p>

</p>
<p>Wanted: young men to ante up their arms for H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday, almost 46 per cent or 111,300 residents in the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region received H1N1 vaccinations over the past nine weeks. About the same number of males and females were vaccinated in age groups under 20.</p>
<p>But it's a different story in the 20 to 34-year-old category.</p>
<p>In that age group, 9,485 women were immunized compared to 5,512 men. In the 35 to 64-year-old category, 23,292 women received the H1N1 shot compared to 17,697 men. In the 65-plus category, 10,610 women were vaccinated compared to 8,159 men.</p>
<p>"We encourage anyone who has not yet been vaccinated to make an appointment as vaccinations will still be available through the end of March," said Dr. Maurice Hennink, deputy medical health officer with the RQHR.</p>
<p>In particular, he urged young men to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"The younger folks are the ones who have been more affected by the H1N1 disease," Hennink said. "It's a good idea to protect yourself by getting immunized and, in doing so, you're protecting the health of your family, friends and co-workers."</p>
<p>He said health officials are keeping a close eye out for signs of a third wave of illness.</p>
<p>"The third wave of illness that we could potentially be seeing in the winter months would probably be a mixture of the H1N1 virus and the common winter viruses that we typically see at this time of year," Hennink said. "We ask that the general public to continue to be watchful, wash their hands on a regular basis and stay home if you're ill."</p>
<p>The region continues to calculate the cost of the H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>"I don't have that figure at this time," Hennink said.</p>
<p>He expressed his gratitude to the staff and volunteers who participated in the largest vaccination effort the region has ever undertaken.</p>
<p>The region's immunization campaign involved:</p>
<p>- More than a dozen Regina sites including schools, post-secondary institutions, physician offices, long-term care facilities, personal care homes, community centres, clinics and agencies such as Carmichael Outreach;</p>
<p>- Clinics were held in 16 rural communities;</p>
<p>- 175 nurses vaccinated residents;</p>
<p>- 23 RQHR security officers were at the former Robert Usher Collegiate site providing 1,117 hours of time including assisting the public at the mass immunization clinic;</p>
<p>- 34 RQHR clerical staff registered people at the clinics while another 11 inputted all of the immunization information into computer databases;</p>
<p>- In Regina, 212 volunteers contributed 2,395 hours of time in assisting people at the immunization clinics;</p>
<p>- In the western part of the region, which includes Fort Qu'Appelle, Balcarres and Lestock, 28 volunteers assisted at community vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>The region's mass immunization campaign is over, but appointments are available at the public health offices in north and east Regina.</p>
<p>Vaccinations will be offered at the north office, 204 Wascana St., on Tuesdays only. Those wishing to get the H1N1 shot in east Regina can do so at 1911 Park St. on Wednesdays only. To make an appointment, call 766-7700.</p>
<p>Residents in other areas of Saskatchewan can check their health region's website for immunization information, phone their public health office or call HealthLine at 1-877-800-0002.</p>

</p>
<p>ELMIRA</p>
<p>The first text message came from Haiti at about 4:30 p.m.</p>
<p>"We have arrived. It's hot. Love You,' read the dispatch Tuesday afternoon from Marilyn Raymer to her husband, Bob, back home in Elmira.</p>
<p>The next, at 5:06 p.m. "Earthquake. OK." Then "Guest house gone," about 15 minutes later. And a final one at 7:17 p.m.</p>
<p>"It said ‘Yvonne is buried under the rubble along with two other people,' " Bob Raymer recounted Wednesday night before a group of reporters at the Waterloo Mennonite Brethren Church.</p>
<p>Yvonne Martin, an Elmira-area nurse on her fourth medical mission to the impoverished country, was trapped. On Wednesday morning, Marilyn Raymer relayed the devastating news to her husband by phone. Yvonne's body had been recovered.</p>
<p>Martin, 67, was the first confirmed Canadian casualty in what's been described as the largest earthquake to strike Haiti, one of hundreds of thousands feared dead.</p>
<p>The group, a seven-member team co-ordinated by the Evangelical Church of Canada, had barely gotten off the plane when the disaster struck the capital of Port-au-Prince.</p>
<p>Raymer believes the group may have experienced the initial quake as they travelled to the two-storey guest house.</p>
<p>Martin was the only member inside the guest house when it collapsed, in what Raymer believes was one of dozens of aftershocks. Most of the group members are from the Elmira area, with one from Barrie.</p>
<p>Raymer had been in constant communication with Martin's husband, Ron, and her family as he received updates. Wednesday's phone call was a very difficult one to make, Raymer said.</p>
<p>"They appreciated knowing, because the only thing worse than knowing is not knowing - not knowing if she was suffering, if she was trapped in the rubble," said Raymer, whom the family has designated as a spokesperson.</p>
<p>He was told Martin apparently died instantly.</p>
<p>"The family was able to take comfort in that, that now they knew where she was," Raymer said. "We believe to be absent from the body is to be present with the Lord."</p>
<p>Martin had three sons and 10 grandchildren. Raymer said plans to bring her home haven't been finalized.</p>
<p>He's also not sure when the rest of the team, including his wife, will return.</p>
<p>"My hope is that they will come home and attend funeral services and say good bye to their loved one, and then look forward to going back and continuing the work that Yvonne loved to do," Raymer said.</p>
<p>The group was planning to provide medical care and support in several of the island nation's northern communities.</p>
<p>Colleagues and friends of Martin remembered her as a dedicated professional who knew and cared for the people in her small community.</p>
<p>"She was very well integrated into the community and certainly in the office here, so the mood is just very sad and upsetting today," said Dr. Michael Norris at the Elmira Medical Clinic.</p>
<p>Martin retired a couple of years ago after 36 years at the Elmira clinic and started her humanitarian aid work, but was quick to help with the centre's H1N1 clinics last fall.</p>
<p>"We needed some extra hands because our nurses were busy with the clinic, and Yvonne was more than willing to come out of retirement and help us manage our H1N1 flu clinics," Norris said.</p>
<p>"The need was high, the demand was there and she was there. She still had a personal commitment to people's health."</p>
<p>Norris said the people at the clinic will miss Martin.</p>
<p>"She was a very professional nurse and wouldn't say ‘no' if we asked her for help or to stay later, and really gave of herself," he said. "She was outwardly caring, interested, a real classic old-time nurse."</p>
<p>Martin turned to missionary work after formally retiring from the medical clinic and was on her fourth medical mission to Haiti, her church said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It is with a heavy heart that I share with you the death of our dear sister, Yvonne Martin," read a statement posted by the Waterloo Mennonite Brethren Church.</p>
<p>"Yvonne passed away as a result of the earthquake in Haiti, where she had just arrived to do medical mission work for the fourth time."</p>
<p>The president of the Evangelical Church of Canada, Phil Delsaut, said in a statement the group was "deeply saddened by this loss, and wish to express our sincere sympathy to her family.</p>
<p>"We also extend our sympathy to the families of other foreign relief workers injured or missing and to the people of Haiti affected by this disaster."</p>
<p>Martin's church also posted a statement on its website, and invited parishioners to gather for prayer.</p>
<p>"Please continue to pray for her family, especially her husband Ron," the posting read. "In unity with them we are consoled to know that she died doing exactly what she loved to do."</p>
<p>Harold Albrecht, the Conservative MP for Kitchener-Conestoga, posted a notice on his website saying his thoughts and prayers are with the Martin family.</p>
<p>"Although I did not know Yvonne personally, there are ties between our extended families that go back many years," wrote Albrecht.</p>
<p>"Yvonne was in Haiti to help set up mobile clinics. This need still exists."</p>
<p>"She really looked forward to her missions," said Kathy Howald, a friend and former classmate of Martin's from John Mahood Public School and Elmira District Secondary School.</p>
<p>"You could tell by the way she talked about it that it meant a lot to her … They felt they really made a difference."</p>

<p>Colleagues and friends of an Ontario nurse who died in the earthquake in Haiti are remembering her as a dedicated professional who knew and cared for the people in her small community.</p>
<p>Yvonne Martin of Elmira was one of seven people who had arrived in Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince on Tuesday afternoon, about 90 minutes before the earthquake hit. The group was planning to provide medical care and support in several of the island nation's northern communities.</p>

</p>
<p>CALGARY -- Ted Morton, who has complained for years that Alberta coughs up too much cash through Canada's equalization formula to prop up poorer regions, is the province's new Finance Minister assigned with re-examining the scheme.</p>
<p>Alberta Premier Ed Stelmach, who shuffled his cabinet yesterday in a bid to stem rising public displeasure and a growing political threat, complained to reporters that, even as the province suffers from the economic downturn, it still sent $21.1-billion to Ottawa.</p>
<p>“I don't think that's fair and that's one of the areas we're going to be looking at,” he said.</p>
<p>Alberta faces a projected $4.3-billion deficit and the budget will be delivered Feb. 9. Mr. Stelmach, who has pledged to be back in the black in three years, said his new cabinet is “better prepared to communicate the policies and objectives” of the Progressive Conservative government.</p>
<p>Mr. Morton, who, in 2001, was co-author, along with Stephen Harper, of the controversial “firewall letter” designed to protect Alberta's interests, inherits the key money job from Iris Evans, who becomes Minister of International and Intergovernmental Relations. He hands over his Sustainable Resource portfolio to Mel Knight, who has been tossed as energy minister after a stormy relationship with industry.</p>
<p>Ron Liepert takes over the Energy portfolio, leaving behind Health, where he became a controversial figure and was widely faulted for mishandling the H1N1 flu vaccination rollout as opposition parties repeatedly called for his resignation.</p>
<p>Gene Zwozdesky takes over in Health.</p>
<p>But the biggest promotion went to Mr. Morton, who ran against Mr. Stelmach for the leadership of the party, and is considered as cut from the same philosophical cloth as the upstart, right-wing Wildrose Alliance Party, which grabbed two disenfranchised Tory MLAs last week.</p>
<p>“Obviously the elevation of Ted Morton is to placate the right wing – the far, far right – and perhaps try to outflank the Wildrose Alliance,” said Keith Brownsey, a political scientist at Mount Royal University in Calgary.</p>
<p>Rumours of a cabinet shuffle have been in the air since Mr. Stelmach received a 77-per-cent approval rating from party faithful last fall. They picked up steam as polls showed the flagging popularity of the Premier and the party and Wildrose surging into the lead, and then again with the defections of the two MLAs.</p>
<p>“There isn't exactly a new face on this government,” Prof. Brownsey said. “It's a shuffling of chairs. Steady as she goes – that's the message I would take away from this lack of change.”</p>
<p>Opposition parties echoed those sentiments.</p>
<p>NDP Leader Brian Mason described the shuffle as akin to “changing the lounge chairs on the Hindenburg.” Liberal Leader David Swann complained that the “same bums” are in the seats around the cabinet table. And Wildrose Leader Danielle Smith said the only real change will come when the government is replaced with her party.</p>
<p>For the energy industry, the appointment of Mr. Liepert, who hails from Calgary, brings hope of better government relations.</p>
<p>“We're very pleased to have a seasoned cabinet veteran and a leader in this critical and complex portfolio,” said Travis Davies, spokesman for the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers.</p>
<p>Mr. Knight spent much of his tenure in a brawl with the energy industry over royalties as the province hiked its take when the oil patch was awash with profits. Industry complained the changes made Alberta uncompetitive. When commodity prices crashed, the province backtracked, adjusting the scheme four times, with more changes likely to come.</p>
<p>The legislature will be back in session Feb. 4.</p>

<p>To a generation or two of patients from her rural community in Central Ontario, Yvonne Martin was the senior nurse at the local clinic who gave them their vaccinations, weighed their babies and took their blood pressure.</p>
<p>Then, retired and a grandmother, Ms. Martin assumed a new role as an aid worker who went to Haiti and fell in love with the long-suffering nation and its people.</p>
<p>Her mission came to an end on Tuesday afternoon amid the rubble of a collapsed Port-au-Prince guesthouse, the first confirmed death of a Canadian in the earthquake that devastated large swaths of the city and countryside beyond.</p>
<p>A member of a team of seven Canadian nurses who were going to set up mobile clinics in Haiti's northern provinces, Ms. Martin had arrived only an hour and a half before the earthquake struck and was just settling into her hotel.</p>
<p>The other six nurses, all from Ontario, were reported to be safe.</p>
<p>It was the fourth time Ms. Martin had been to Haiti. Prior to her first visit, she had only ever travelled in Canada and the United States, said Michael Norris, a physician at the clinic where Ms. Martin worked.</p>
<p>But with her first mission to Haiti, she found a new calling.</p>
<p>“She knew she would come back,” recalled fellow nurse Yvonne Gingerich.</p>
<p>“She had a passion for Haiti. They were so poor and needed so much.”</p>
<p>Ms. Martin grew up in Elmira, a small town north of Kitchener. She worked for 36 years at the Elmira Medical Centre until she retired two years ago. Her husband, Ron, who runs an agricultural business, is also close to retirement.</p>
<p>In her 60s, Ms. Martin was the mother of three grown sons and a grandmother several times over. But she wasn't ready to settle down just yet, Dr. Norris said.</p>
<p>Last fall, she returned to the clinic in Elmira to help with H1N1 flu vaccinations. But it was Haiti that stirred her heart.</p>
<p>Though a Mennonite, Ms. Martin offered her services to the Evangelical Missionary Church of Canada, which has an office in Kitchener and operates training centres, medical clinics and sanitation projects in Haiti.</p>
<p>Back home, she told friends of her growing admiration for the resilience of the people she encountered in the Caribbean nation.</p>
<p>“She was amazed how people in some fashion can still survive, have a community exist with the minimal help they had. That was one of the first things she said when she came back,” Dr. Norris said.</p>
<p>And so last night, while hundreds of Canadians with ties to Haiti – members of the Haitian diaspora, relatives of aid workers and missionaries – awaited news of their loved ones, a corner of the Ontario heartland mourned a woman who had tried to help the people of an impoverished country.</p>
<p>“Please continue to pray for her family, especially her husband, Ron. In unity with them, we are consoled to know that she died doing exactly what she loved to do,” said a statement posted on the website of Ms. Martin's home congregation, the Waterloo Mennonite Brethren Church.</p>
<p>“She was a very nice woman. She loved to help the less fortunate,” said 15-year-old Tyler Martin, the son of an acquaintance.</p>

<p>Tickets: $10, $8 for seniors and students, children under 12 free.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Victoria nutrition consultant Sam Graci and local eating disorder expert Michelle Morand are two of the experts who will speak at this weekend's Total Health Show in Victoria Conference Centre.</p>
<p>Morand, author of Food Is Not the Problem, Deal With What Is and founder and director of the Cedric Centre -- cedriccentre.com -- will discuss practical and effective tools for overcoming emotional, psychological and physical barriers to optimum health at 1:15 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>"My talk pretty much pertains to everyone -- whether you use food to cope or not," she said.</p>
<p>"It's for people who want to make changes to their health. Perhaps they are borderline diabetic, or have cholesterol issues, or want to follow through on commitments to themselves regarding an exercise regime."</p>
<p>Graci will explain how to lose weight, gain energy, have better skin, lower cholesterol and slow signs of aging, by eating a diet low in acid production.</p>
<p>The bestselling author and developer of Greens+ supplements has long stressed the connection between a body's pH and health.</p>
<p>"Studies have shown a direct link between an acidic pH and a variety of health issues," he said, adding this shows up as low energy and poor digestion. "It can also lead to low bone density, poor skin and hair, weight gain, premature aging, inadequate absorption of essential vitamins and minerals, frequent colds, flu and headaches."</p>
<p>Graci said most people tend to be more acidic than alkaline because they eat too many foods such as poultry, eggs, meat, grains, legumes, nuts and seeds, which trigger acid production in the body. "Cola beverages, alcohol and coffee are also acid-forming, and should be avoided when possible."</p>
<p>Stress and extreme exercise can also contribute to acidity, whereas vegetables like broccoli and kale, herbs, spices and root vegetables help raise alkaline levels. You might think that acidic citrus fruits would have an acidifying effect, but they are alkalizing and very good for the body, he says.</p>
<p>Graci will speak at 11 a.m. Saturday in the main theatre.</p>
<p>Keynote speakers include Lorna Vanderhaeghe on healthy hearts, Dr. Michael Murray on "what the drug companies won't tell you and your doctor doesn't know," Brad King on stress, "the silent saboteur," and Dr. Gerry Bohemier on a natural way to prevent swine flu. Other presenters discuss everything from chronic pain and medicinal mushrooms to fitness for seniors and the power of positive thought.</p>

<p>The breast health centre at Saskatoon City Hospital is closer to being the one-stop shop it was intended to be.</p>
<p>The StarPhoenix reported in October that women who required wire localization prior to surgery -- having a wire inserted to indicate where a biopsy will be performed -- would have the wire inserted at City Hospital and then travel to St. Paul's Hospital for the actual surgery.</p>
<p>In December, access to those surgeries began to be offered at City Hospital and now the majority of women undergoing the procedure are able to have both the wire insertion and the surgery performed at City Hospital, Saskatoon Health Region (SHR) CEO Maura Davies said Wednesday in her report to the health region board.</p>
<p>"(It) saves them the pain and discomfort and inconvenience of having to go across the city," she said.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>The cost of responding to the H1N1 pandemic in the SHR is expected to come in slightly above the $2 million initially estimated.</p>
<p>As of the end of November, the pandemic response has cost the health region $1.75 million, said Deborah Rhodes, SHR's vice-president of finance and administration, during her report Wednesday to the health region board.</p>
<p>Full numbers are expected once December's financial statements are finalized. The H1N1 clinic at Prairieland Park, for example, stayed open until Dec. 19 so there will be costs from that included in the final tally.</p>
<p>The costs of dealing with the pandemic won't affect the health region's budget, however, as the province has committed to cover those expenses, Rhodes said.</p>

<p>Wadena has gained a new physician with the addition of Dr. Mosenza Kiapway to the community.</p>
<p>Kiapway began seeing patients in the Wadena Medical Clinic on Dec. 28 and is currently accepting new patients.</p>
<p>In addition to Kiapway, Dr. Ismat Ullah has also been recruited to work in Wadena. Ullah is completing the evaluation and training process and will be working in Wadena during the next few months.</p>
<p>"It is our ultimate goal to have three physicians, along with the nurse practitioner, working together as a primary health team in Wadena," said Kelvin Fisher, SHR's director of rural health and planning, in a news release.</p>
<p>The SHR and the Wadena and Area Health Foundation worked together to co-ordinate the recruitment.</p>

<p>A new physician is practising in Strasbourg. Dr. Abdulkarim Dirie began working there on Dec. 7.</p>
<p>Dirie replaces Dr. David Archer, who left Strasbourg in August 2009. Dirie is a graduate of the Medical College of Somalia and the international medical graduate program in Winnipeg. He was most recently working in Regina and previously worked in Manitoba in Winnipeg, Crystal City and The Pas.</p>
<p>The SHR and the Strasbourg and District Health Centre worked together during the recruitment process.</p>
<p>"We have devoted a great deal of time and energy to our recruitment efforts and it is gratifying to witness this positive outcome," Strasbourg and District Health Centre chair Scott Hegglin said in a news release.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>SHR absolutely not overstocked with managers</b>
</div><div>Maura Davies   </div>
<div>Special to The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>781 words</div><div>14 January 2010</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>Following is the viewpoint of the writer, president and CEO of the Saskatoon Health Region.</p>
<p>It is disappointing and frustrating to read the column by Mark Lemstra entitled, SHR overstocked with managers, advisers (SP, Jan. 7). It is difficult to understand why, as a former out-of-scope employee of the Saskatoon Health Region and researcher, Lemstra presented information which is so blatantly inaccurate or misleading.</p>
<p>Out of respect for the 437 dedicated staff (serving both the region and our affiliate agencies) who manage and lead our workforce of 12,440 employees and work with our 850 physicians, it is important to provide some facts.</p>
<p>Lemstra would have been better informed by examining the evidence provided through the 2009 Patient First Administrative Review, which concluded that the Saskatchewan health system spends less than other Canadian jurisdictions on administration as a percentage of operating spending.</p>
<p>He referred to all non-unionized staff as being either managers or "advisers." We assume the group to which he refers so dismissively as "advisers" includes staff in areas such as human resources, finance and information technology, who play vital roles in any large organization.</p>
<p>As of March 31, 2009, we have 3,019 registered nurses and registered psychiatric nurses working in our Region. This is 33 per cent more than identified in Lemstra's column.</p>
<p>Our clinical managers often manage large numbers of nurses and other professionals who work in interdisciplinary teams. Many managers oversee 24-hour, seven-days-a-week operations with more than 100 employees, sometimes at multiple sites.</p>
<p>Extensive research confirms that the higher the number of people reporting to a manager, the lower the staff job satisfaction and patient satisfaction. Recent studies in Saskatchewan, too, have reflected the challenges associated with managers having large numbers of employees reporting to them.</p>
<p>In a 2009 report, "Commitment to Care: Nursing Recruitment and Retention in Saskatchewan," MLA Laura Ross identified the large number of frontline employees reporting to nurse managers as a major challenge that needs to be addressed to ensure recruitment and retention of nursing staff. The Patient First Review also recommended that nurse managers have more targeted time for employees, and called for a review of the workload resulting from the number of employees reporting to one manager.</p>
<p>Having a large number of employees reporting to one manager is not limited to our nursing managers.</p>
<p>As a researcher, Lemstra should also realize that comparison of the region's Public Health Service department with the Community Clinic is seriously flawed. Both Public Health and the Community Clinic provide important services. However, they have different roles and programs, and serve different clients.</p>
<p>Public Health is responsible for providing services such as child health programs, immunization, restaurant inspections and public health surveillance to all of the communities within our region, with a population of 300,000. Public Health staff are also involved in teaching and research and the control of disease outbreaks, including the recent mass immunization clinics for H1N1. The three medical health officers provide clinical oversight for these services and are not administrative physicians.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Community Clinic is an excellent community partner that provides primary health-care services to a much smaller population.</p>
<p>The comparison of benefits for SHR's out-of-scope (non-unionized) and unionized employees is misleading. For example, although out-of-scope employees have access to 85 paid sick days per year, these days are not cumulative and exist in the absence of short-term disability coverage. SEIU members have access to short-term disability benefits and receive 15 paid sick days annually, which can be accumulated up to a maximum of 160 days.</p>
<p>Non-unionized staff receive 12 earned days off, which is similar to those received by unionized staff. Out-of-scope staff do not receive overtime pay except under exceptional circumstances, and this benefit is provided at straight time.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in-scope employees receive overtime for all additional hours worked, at rates ranging from 1.5 times to 2.5 times their hourly pay. Unlike unionized staff, out-of-scope managers do not receive extra compensation for being on call or on standby.</p>
<p>Our region is fortunate to have competent, compassionate and committed managers and supervisors, who go above and beyond the call of duty to ensure the delivery of exceptional service. We thank them for being part of our team, for their leadership and for serving our communities.</p>
<p>Do we have room for improvement? Could we be more efficient? Absolutely. We continuously strive to provide value for every dollar invested in health care.</p>
<p>Are we overstocked with managers and supervisors? Absolutely not.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doctor claims she beat swine flu with vitamin D, elderberry; 'Sunshine vitamin' cited as potential cure for respiratory ailments, but officials warn about overdose risk, interaction with other treatments</b>
</div><div>Pamela Fayerman   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>764 words</div><div>13 January 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Dr. Gillian Arsenault admits she's probably raised more than a few eyebrows with her belief that she "beat" swine flu with large doses of vitamin D, along with elderberry syrup.</p>
<p>Arsenault is a former family doctor now working in public health as a medical health officer in the Fraser Health region, the area of the province that has been hardest hit by H1N1(360 hospitalizations and 17 deaths as of Tuesday).</p>
<p>Arsenault got H1N1 before she could get vaccinated against it. Though she had a prescription for an antiviral medication on standby, she never had to resort to it because although the flu hit her "like a truck," she was all but better by the fourth day, except for a lingering cough.</p>
<p>Now she's sharing what she believes may have done the trick: a combination of vitamin D and elderberry.</p>
<p>"Medicine is my job and my hobby. I spend a lot of time after work looking things up," she said in an interview, referring to her research on complementary health care for prevention of illness and treatment.</p>
<p>But she says she's not using her position in public health to advocate for complementary therapies.</p>
<p>"This is not part of my role in public health," she said. Asked how other doctors react to her interest in complementary therapies, she said: "I do talk to other doctors about these things and lots roll their eyes, yes, while telling me to send them the studies and references. A few actually get excited."</p>
<p>In a current column about her H1N1 experience in the Medical Post, Arsenault notes that she was aware of research showing that vitamin D supplementation may prevent respiratory tract infections. So theoretically, it might also be useful in treating flu.</p>
<p>The so-called sunshine vitamin has been promoted for everything from reducing the risk of cancer to immune system boosting. In 2007, Arsenault was taking 1,000 IU (the dose recommended by the Canadian Cancer Society) but over the past year, she has taken daily doses ranging from 3,000 IU to 5,000 IU. When she got the pandemic flu, she adjusted her daily dose because she was interested in combining the vitamin supplementation with elderberry extract, which has been shown to reduce the duration and severity of flu. Arsenault paid to have her vitamin D levels tested at a lab to ensure she was within a recommended range.</p>
<p>Arsenault concedes she can't know for sure if the vitamin supplement, the elderberry, or both, helped in her recovery. But it makes her wonder if loading up on vitamin D might "abort the development of severe illness or enhance the benefit of antiviral treatment for those already seriously ill."</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, B.C.'s chief provincial health official, said he's aware of some of the research on vitamin D, but he doesn't believe the products are ready for prime time as "population-based interventions."</p>
<p>"I think it is generally accepted that vitamin D levels in Canadian populations are suboptimal given our long and cloudy winters, however even with that, the experience of H1N1 influenza for most individuals was considered to be mild to moderate," he said, referring to the fact that it doesn't seem like low vitamin D levels are a factor in flu activity.</p>
<p>Kendall added that he knows "next to nothing about elderberry syrup."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in a new paper published in the Annals of Pharmacotherapy, B.C. Dr. Ran Goldman and co-authors draw attention to the potential risks of vitamin supplementation.</p>
<p>Goldman, who works at B.C. Children's Hospital, concludes that certain vitamins--A, E, D, folic acid and niacin -- should be classified as over-the-counter medications which would result in better labelling about dosing and potential dangers, among other things.</p>
<p>With respect to vitamin D, a tolerable upper limit is 2,000 IU daily, the study states. Symptoms of toxicity when the upper limit has been exceeded may include weakness, fatigue, headache, nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle or bone pain, kidney stones and kidney impairment and anemia.</p>
<p>Serious symptoms of toxicity may also include, bone loss, pancreatitis, seizures and psychosis, according to the article titled, "Safety Considerations and Potential Interactions of Vitamins: Should Vitamins be Considered Drugs?" It says vitamin D may also interact poorly with medications containing aluminum, digoxin, magnesium and thiazides (diuretics).</p>

</div><div>Damien Cox   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>The scenario unfolded perfectly.</p>
<p>The young prospect finally getting his chance in the big leagues. A late-bloomer who took the long, hard road through the NCAA, eventually signing with an NHL club as a free agent and then working his way through the minors to get a shot in the shiny rinks with all the luxury suites and fancy lighting.</p>
<p>Then, with his parents in the stands, scoring the winning goal.</p>
<p>It all happened Tuesday night at the ACC. Just to a different player, a different team, than most of the fans in attendance would have hoped for.</p>
<p>The dream scenario for Maple Leaf fans, naturally, was that 23-year-old Tyler Bozak would be the hero by the end of Tuesday night's game against the Carolina Hurricanes, the only team that sits below the Leafs in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>To the Leafs from Regina by way of Denver University as a highly touted collegiate free agent last spring, Bozak was called up for his second NHL game last night, principally to try to jump-start slumping Leaf sniper Phil Kessel.</p>
<p>To some degree he did.</p>
<p>But instead of Bozak, it was an even older former NCAA player on the Carolina bench, Patrick Dwyer, who had the perfect ending.</p>
<p>In only his 21st game this season, the 26-year-old centre cruised past a daydreaming, flat-footed Luke Schenn in front of the Leaf net and calmly tipped his fourth NHL goal past Jonas Gustavsson for what proved to be the winner in a 4-2 Hurricanes triumph.</p>
<p>Dwyer, to Carolina from Spokane by way of Western Michigan University as a little-noticed free agent in '06, even had his parents in from Wisconsin to watch.</p>
<p>"It took me a while to get here to the NHL," he said afterwards. "But looking back, it's even more exciting to have made it against the odds."</p>
<p>It was one of those classic hockey moments where the hard-working kid who was never supposed to make it at all outfoxes the heralded first-round pick (Schenn) and the acclaimed European free agent (Gustavsson) to win the game.</p>
<p>It's the great thing about the sport. Once you're on the ice, nobody asks where you were drafted or how large your signing bonus was. It's about producing and making plays.</p>
<p>Bozak made some plays Tuesday night, but as nice as a couple were they weren't enough to get Kessel to light the lamp. Kessel had some glorious chances, but either Cam Ward was good in the Carolina net or Kessel just isn't finding the holes.</p>
<p>To be sure, it was a sign of desperation that the Leafs decided to call up Bozak and stick him on a line with Kessel and Nikolai Kulemin. Usually, four goals, 16 assists and a minus-8 rating in the AHL doesn't result in that kind of marquee promotion, but the Leafs are in a bad, bad way right now.</p>
<p>Bozak's first year of getting paid to play was ruined to some degree partway through when he contracted the H1N1 virus, costing him the 15 pounds of extra muscle he'd laboured to add last summer.</p>
<p>"It's definitely been a big transition," he said after picking up an assist on Kulemin's goal. "I was used to playing two games, then having Sunday to Thursday off to rest my body. This is so different."</p>
<p>It could end up that, like Dwyer, Bozak will be 25 or 26 years old before it all starts coming together for him as an NHL player.</p>
<p>"Hey, two years ago I was sitting at school with my buddies having a fantasy NHL draft," he smiled. "This is a privilege."</p>
<p>Bozak is going to get another shot Thursday against Philly. And probably many more shots after that.</p>
<p>Perhaps the dream scenario owned last night by an opponent will one day be his.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>We dance to Stephen Harper's tunes</b>
</div><div>Carol Goar   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>661 words</div><div>13 January 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Our Prime Minister has a rather unflattering view of us.</p>
<p>According to Stephen Harper, we are untroubled by allegations that his government ignored repeated warnings that Canadian troops, unlike any of their NATO counterparts, were handing over Afghan prisoners of war to local authorities who subjected them to torture.</p>
<p>If these claims are true, Canada knowingly violated the 61-year-old Geneva Convention, which prohibits signatories from torturing enemy combatants or turning them over to regimes that use torture. Our country's long-standing reputation for upholding international law and defending human rights would be badly blemished.</p>
<p>"That's not on the top of the radar for most Canadians," the Prime Minister told CBC anchor Peter Mansbridge in his first televised interview of the new year.</p>
<p>Harper considers us too complacent to oppose his decision to shut down Parliament until early March, making it impossible for MPs to ascertain what actually happened in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>If his reading is correct, we will soon get over our media-induced tantrum, turn our attention to the Winter Olympics and accept his self-granted right to cut off national debate whenever it serves his interests.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister is confident we will buy his government's claim that it handled the H1N1 pandemic properly.</p>
<p>He sees no need to explain - or apologize for - Ottawa's failure to provide H1N1 vaccine to most of the population until the flu had passed its peak. He is letting provincial and municipal authorities take the heat for rationing the serum when demand was high, shutting down their clinics when Ottawa didn't deliver the vaccine they'd been promised, and inoculating fewer than half of Canadians. He is counting on taxpayers to cheerfully write off this $400-million learning exercise.</p>
<p>And Harper assumes he can casually tell Canadians: "I am a lot more concerned by God's verdict on my life than the one of historians."</p>
<p>If we let this go unchallenged, as he anticipates, he will be free to set a new standard of accountability in Canadian politics: elected leaders can substitute their religious precepts for the will of the people. They can justify their actions to God, not us.</p>
<p>It adds up to a discomfiting national portrait: we don't care whether our country flouts international law, we won't bestir ourselves to defend our democratic rights, we can be induced to shrug off the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars on an overhyped, poorly executed pandemic management program, and we'll settle for a head of government who answers to God, not us.</p>
<p>What is most troubling is that Harper may have pegged us accurately:</p>
<p>He gambled in 2008 that we would re-elect him if he promised there would be no recession and no deficit on his watch. That worked.</p>
<p>He gambled 13 months ago that he could shut down Parliament to avoid a vote of confidence that would have toppled his government. That worked.</p>
<p>He gambled he could convince us that his government's stimulus plan - which consisted primarily of small grants to municipalities for already slated construction projects - sparked Canada's economic recovery. That seems to have worked.</p>
<p>And he gambled he could promise a "new era of accountability," then systematically silence voices that contradicted his own: those of parliamentarians, public servants and members of independent federal agencies. So far, that has worked.</p>

<p>A brief display of indignation won't do it. Harper has waited out several of those.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Public health reaches out to transients</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>
<div>Mercury Staff</div>
<div>634 words</div><div>12 January 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health is extending a pilot program reaching out to transient people who may suffer from tuberculosis or another respiratory ailment called IPD, invasive pneumococcal disease.</p>
<p>It recently received endorsement from public health's board of directors to continue work with at-risk populations, a pilot that began last fall at Sister Christine Leyser's Drop-In Centre downtown.</p>
<p>Initial results were encouraging, with drop-in-centre clients receptive to testing and inoculation.</p>
<p>"We were really pleased by the success of it," health board communicable diseases manager Janice Walters said Monday.</p>
<p>So is Leyser.</p>
<p>"A lot of people responded," she said, pleased her drop-in centre's clients welcomed the public health board.</p>
<p>"I'm happy," Leyser said. "It's wonderful for the people.</p>
<p>"We are blessed."</p>
<p>Walters said while there is no vaccine for TB, it is treatable. There is inoculation, however, against IPD, hence the focus on prevention with a vaccine protecting against 23 strains.</p>
<p>The board is now considering how best to boost service, perhaps with twice-yearly clinics at the drop-in centre.</p>
<p>It'll consider its options during discussions with the drop-in facility and other community-focused organizations, such as the Guelph Community Health Centre, Walters said.</p>
<p>Infectious tuberculosis, caused by airborne bacteria, primarily attacks the lungs, but may also strike other parts of the body.</p>
<p>Infectious streptococcus pneumonia bacteria can lead to invasive pneumococcal disease, simply called IPD, a respiratory ailment.</p>
<p>Medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer told the health board's directors at a meeting Jan. 6 early detection of TB can reduce its spread.</p>
<p>The threat of IPD can be countered through immunization. But homeless and transient populations are "hard to reach" and "more susceptible" than the population as a whole, she continued.</p>
<p>Hence the infectious disease prevention pilot program initiated last October with input from the Guelph Community Health Centre, in which health board staff offered TB testing and IPD vaccine inoculations at the drop-in centre on Gordon Street.</p>
<p>The centre, guided by Sister Christine Leyser, is a refuge for the homeless, offering meals, friendship, guidance and support in a non-intimidating store-front-style setting. It's long been a fixture in Guelph.</p>
<p>"This is the first time we've ever offered this kind of pilot project," Mercer said.</p>
<p>In two one-hour clinics, public health carried out 19 TB skin tests and gave 30 inoculations. Staff returned two days after each clinic to provide results of the skin tests to those tested, though five clients did not return for their test results, Mercer noted.</p>
<p>Health unit director Maggie Laidlaw wanted to know what happened to those five. Mercer said her staff left calling cards, but there was no response.</p>
<p>But Mercer was encouraged enough by the initial overall results to want to continue with this outreach effort.</p>
<p>The response rate amounted to roughly 50 per cent of clients at the drop-in centre at the time of the clinics.</p>
<p>A report to directors noted another benefit: drop-in centre clients sought information on two other topical health risks in the community last fall: pandemic H1N1 flu and the seasonal variety.</p>
<p>TB and streptococcus pneumonia infections are not unknown in the region covered by the public health board.</p>
<p>It reported seven cases of the former and 19 of the latter in the year just past.</p>
<p>That's five more cases of TB than in 2007, but the same number of IPD-related cases.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis is related to an estimated 1.6 million deaths annually across the globe, according to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>An awareness program, World Tuberculosis Day, falls on March 24, an event organized by a network of organizations called the Stop TB Partnership.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Alberta Health Services going rogue; Growing power a problem for gov't</b>
</div><div>Paula Simons   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>851 words</div><div>12 January 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>On Dec. 14th, 2009, an extraordinary letter arrived at the office of Alberta's public guardian.</p>
<p>The office protects the interests of dependent adults, those not competent to handle their own affairs and who don't have a family member to act for them. A number of long-term residents at Alberta Hospital are in the care of the public guardian, including some who've been institutionalized most of their lives.</p>
<p>The guardian's office was informed Alberta Hospital would no longer be providing snacks, soap, tampons, toothbrushes, laundry detergent, fabric softener and condiments like salsa for residents. The office was advised that it would either have to provide these things for patients or pay the hospital $20 a month, per patient, to cover the cost of food and sanitary supplies.</p>
<p>Now, you could make an argument that it's not the job of Alberta Health Services to pay for food and soap and maxi-pads, that non-health-related items should be paid for by family members or by some other provincial department. But given how poor and vulnerable the patient population is, and given this new policy was going to save Alberta Health Services just $70,000 a year, the new directive seemed both petty and punitive.</p>
<p>Considering how upset many of the staff at Alberta Hospital are with plans to close 246 beds and reduce services at their facility, you might have thought the letter was a bit of a guerrilla publicity stunt, an attempt by front-line staff to embarrass their bosses with an outrageous program cut just before Christmas.</p>
<p>Except that when The Journal called Alberta Health Services about the cut, the AHS confirmed and defended the policy. The move, said AHS, was part of a plan to align and standardize supplies across the province, suggesting it was unfair for mental patients committed to a residential hospital to get free soap and toothpaste when the rest of us bring our own toiletries to hospital.</p>
<p>When the news broke on The Journal's front page, six days before Christmas, there was a blizzard of outrage.</p>
<p>The premier's office was apparently completely blindsided. It seems no one had informed Health Minister Ron Liepert or Premier Ed Stelmach of the potentially explosive policy change -- nor of the fact that The Journal was about to publish a story about it.</p>
<p>Within hours of the story's publication, Edmonton MLA Fred Horne, the premier's point-man on the contentious Alberta Hospital file, had called the paper to announce that the Stelmach government had ordered Alberta Health Services to rescind the policy. But the political damage had been done.</p>
<p>Last week, floor-crossing MLA Heather Forsyth even dredged the whole matter up again, when she cited the original policy as one of her reasons for leaving the Progressive Conservatives in favour of the Wildrose Alliance.</p>
<p>For months, though, there have been growing tensions between the Alberta government and Alberta Health Services, between the obstreperous health minister and Stephen Duckett, the pugnacious head of AHS.</p>
<p>There have been other sore points -- including the trouble-plagued rollout of the H1N1 flu vaccine, the jokey and vulgar presentation by the AHS senior staffers at B.C. medical conference, in which the AHS revealed it would be out of cash by this February, and the extraordinary decision by AHS to borrow $220 million from the Royal Bank.</p>
<p>But the strangest battle has been the tug of war over Alberta Hospital, a decision on which the premier's office and Alberta Health Services have several times appeared to be at cross-purposes: AHS keen to fast-track bed closures with Stelmach seemingly trying to slow the process down. Again and again, Duckett and AHS have embarrassed the premier's office, and undercut both Liepert's authority and Stelmach's, while they, in turn, have attacked his autonomy.</p>
<p>For Stelmach, centralizing so much power in the hands of one unelected bureaucrat heading an an arm's-length agency has proved a strategic miscalculation. Far from being the Tory's pliant creature, Duckett established himself as a fiercely independent operative, who has made some tough, even radical, decisions with little regard for their political consequences. Liepert and Stelmach may have hired Duckett as their hatchet man, with the power to cut as he saw fit. But instead of providing his elected masters with a layer of political insulation, Duckett has become the Aussie Frankenstein they can't control.</p>
<p>With a major cabinet shuffle imminent, and all the smart money on Liepert's ejection from the health portfolio, Stelmach may solve one part of his PR problem. But with the amalgamation of the health boards shaping up to be a financial debacle, with more service cuts looming, a ministerial face change alone won't cure the premier's health care woes -- not so long as the real power to control health policy rests, not with the legislature, but with Alberta Health Services.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Staycation' traffic keeps tourism rolling in hard times; 'Modest growth' seen for 2010</b>
</div><div>Tamara Gignac   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>727 words</div><div>12 January 2010</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>B3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>C anada's troubled tourism industry is showing signs of life after weathering the longest downturn in almost two decades,</p>
<p>New figures from Statistics Canada show that domestic tourism spending increased 0.3 per cent in the third quarter, fuelled by recession-weary Canadians who opted for a holiday close to home rather than a foreign vacation.</p>
<p>In Alberta, that's translated into brisk business for campgrounds, museums and amusement parks, many of which attribute most of last year's business to "staycation" traffic from locals and tourists from neighbouring provinces.</p>
<p>It continues to make up for the province's sharp decline in U.S. and international tourism that has yet to fully recover. Air travel from the U.S. fell almost five per cent for the first 10 months of 2009, although traffic into Alberta fared better than the national average.</p>
<p>Provincial tourism officials expect only "modest growth" in the industry for 2010 -- and much of that could come from Albertans themselves. Regional travellers already fork out more than half of the $5.7 billion in annual tourism dollars spent here each year.</p>
<p>There are too many uncertainties to predict when U.S. travel into Alberta will rebound, said Travel Alberta spokesman Don Boynton.</p>
<p>The rising Canadian dollar is a wild card, as are passport, security and border issues, as well as lingering recessionary worries south of the border.</p>
<p>The agency is planning to unveil a new marketing strategy next month designed to target Americans and international visitors as well as mainstay regional markets.</p>
<p>"A lot is dependent on the world economy, which seems to have bottomed out, from all indicators. There's also starting to be a rebound in air travel, which is very important," said Boynton.</p>
<p>"Tourism is, of course, a discretionary expenditure. If people feel they have extra money in their jeans, they will travel to destinations like ours."</p>
<p>In 2009, Heritage Park saw a decline in international and U.S. visitors. But no one is complaining at the popular attraction: gate traffic was up by about 14 per cent.</p>
<p>"The majority of our visitors were Calgarians," said park spokeswoman Barb Munro, "but I think there's optimism that with the recession ending, we will see more international visitors."</p>
<p>Some tour operators -- especially those around Banff and Canmore -- are hoping the 2010 Vancouver Winter Games will bring dollars east of the Rockies. In a post-summer tourism survey prepared for Alberta Tourism, Parks and Recreation, businesses in the area suggested the Games would not only have a spillover affect, but provide an alternate destination to Whistler for sports enthusiasts interested in avoiding the Olympic events entirely.</p>
<p>In a year that saw a significant decline in international guests, Calgary hotels are grateful that business travel remained somewhat strong.</p>
<p>"The U.S. leisure traveller has not returned with any sort of force and a higher Canadian dollar certainly hurts," said Joe Clohessy, president of the Calgary Hotel Association.</p>
<p>"Things seem to be much more stable on the Canadian side of the things, whereas the U.S. economy seems to be struggling."</p>
<p>Hotel occupancy rates in Calgary dropped 8.2 per cent year over year between January and November of 2009.</p>
<p>But there is much to be positive about in 2010, Clohessy points out. Among the biggest is Air Canada's plan to launch a direct flight between Calgary and Tokyo in March.</p>
<p>"It bodes well for our city and we're looking forward to building on that," he said.</p>
<p>If a global recession and H1N1 fears made 2009 a difficult year for Alberta's tourism industry, it is not expected to be the worst of the decade.</p>
<p>In 2003, factors such as SARS, forest fires, mad cow disease and Air Canada's restructuring saw tourism spending drop 20 per cent, or about $1 billion.</p>

<p>Canada's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health has come up with an innovative and simple way to encourage problem drinkers to reduce their alcohol consumption.</p>
<p>The online screening questionnaire www.CheckYourDrinking.nethas[http://www.CheckYourDrinking.nethas] helped some problem drinkers reduce their alcohol consumption by a significant 30 per cent, a recent evaluation showed. More promising is that those drinkers maintained the reduction in three-month and six-month followups.</p>
<p>The early success of this program says several things: that a little intervention goes a long way; that awareness can be powerful medicine; and that, while it can't replace face-to-face medicine, information technology can play an important role in health-care.</p>
<p>This alcohol screening program, for example, can reach people who might never see a doctor to talk about their alcohol consumption, owing to embarrassment, denial or inconvenience. Apparently, drinkers who won't admit publicly they have a problem will still answer some questions in the privacy of their homes. The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health has recognized this gap and addressed it.</p>
<p>There are countless other ways in which the digital age complements health care. When physicians are able to track the spread of the flu through <span class="companylink">Google</span> searches, as they have with the recent H1N1 outbreak, you know the Internet is quickly becoming the 21st-century version of the house call.</p>
<p>The Internet is by far a positive health care tool. A computer suddenly becomes the equivalent of a research library. Good doctors, rather than being defensive about the democratization of medical information, should encourage patients to become informed.</p>
<p>Of course not everything on the Internet is credible or accurate, and doctors are right to point that out--and to direct patients to the most useful sources. Learning to read and navigate the Internet responsibly is an important way for people to take charge of their own health.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Kessel gets a new set-up man; Leafs recall Bozak from Marlies to centre top line, try to help sniper snap his scoring slump</b>
</div><div>Paul Hunter   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>684 words</div><div>12 January 2010</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>S03</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The auditions continue in the talent search for a set-up man for Phil Kessel, the Maple Leafs sniper who has suddenly become American Idle.</p>
<p>With Kessel 12 games into a curious slump in which he has produced one goal and one assist, the Leafs dipped into the minors for a potential fix. Tyler Bozak was recalled from the Marlies on Monday and is expected to step in as the centre on the top line between Kessel and Nikolai Kulemin when the Leafs play host to Carolina on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Rickard Wallin skated on that line during Monday's practice but, with zero goals in 34 games, the veteran Swede was little more than a space holder. Instead, said Wilson, that spot might be for someone who wasn't at practice.</p>
<p>Enter Bozak, who had been with the Marlies on the road. He will join the Leafs on Tuesday for their game-day skate.</p>
<p>"He's not a fourth-line guy ... we'll give him quality ice time and play with good players, that's what he has to do," said Wilson, hinting that Bozak would play with Kessel.</p>
<p>Bozak has had a tough season with the Marlies, battling through injuries and a bout with swine flu. Still, he managed 20 points, including four goals, in his 32 games with the AHL team and has turned it up since returning to the lineup Dec. 12. In 15 games since then, he has 12 points, including two goals, and has shown himself to be a deft playmaker.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old University of Denver product looked very good at training camp and made one brief cameo with the Leafs. In a 4-1 loss to Colorado on Oct. 13, he skated between Lee Stempniak and Viktor Stalberg and picked up an assist. That was the night both Matt Stajan and Niklas Hagman sat as healthy scratches and Bozak, though he played well, was only there because of those unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>Kessel, called out in the media by Wilson last week, continues to take the approach that pucks will "eventually" start going in the net. He's had 60 shots during the last 12 games, including 15 in the last two.</p>
<p>Kessel said he has no issue with Wilson changing his centres. Stajan had been with him for most of his 34 games, and the two had some early success, but Wilson has been playing musical pivots as he tries to snap Kessel out of his funk.</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter. When you're not going right, you've got to change things up, right?" said Kessel. "To build chemistry, it takes a little bit, but you go out there and make the best of it and things will work out."</p>
<p>Kessel scored 36 goals last season with Boston, mostly skating alongside super setup man Marc Savard. The Leafs don't have a centre with Savard's touch, but the right winger said he is fine with that.</p>
<p>"It took me and (Savard) a while to find chemistry in Boston. You'll eventually find that guy that you click with," he said. "I think me and (Stajan) played pretty well together. We seemed to get a lot of chances and a lot of opportunities.</p>
<p>"Just, for some reason right now, it's not finding the back of the net. At the start of the season, it was finding the back of the net, so they come in little streaks. One of these days, they'll start going back in I guess."</p>
<p>Bozak isn't the only training camp standout who might get a shot at the Hurricanes. Defenceman Carl Gunnarsson, out for the last six weeks with a hyperextended elbow, was allowed full contact at practice for the first time on Monday.</p>

</p>
<p>With his team mired in a 3-8-2 skid and falling further behind the pack, Toronto Maple Leafs coach Ron Wilson strongly hinted at Monday's practice that the team would recall rookie Tyler Bozak from the minors in time for Tuesday's game against the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
<p>Wilson also suggested Bozak, a 23-year-old centre in his first pro season after two years with the University of Denver, would play on the Leafs' top line alongside struggling sniper Phil Kessel.</p>
<p>“Maybe we're bringing a guy in who's not here today,” Wilson said, declining to name the mystery skater. “I'm not saying that [it's Bozak], until it's announced.”</p>
<p>The team made it official in the afternoon.</p>
<p>After a difficult start with the Toronto Marlies – including a bout of suspected swine flu that led to him losing roughly 12 pounds earlier in the season – Bozak has earned compliments from his coaches in the AHL of late.</p>
<p>Since returning to the lineup on Dec. 12, he has two goals and 10 points in 15 games for the Marlies, who sit in last place in the Western Conference. On the season, he has four goals and 20 points in 32 games in the minors and one assist in one game with the Leafs.</p>
<p>Bozak is one of three undrafted players Leafs GM Brian Burke signed in the off-season – the others being netminder Jonas Gustavsson and minor-leaguer Christian Hanson.</p>
<p>To make room for Bozak, Wilson said some of the Leafs' injured players (i.e. Mikhail Grabovski, Mike Komisarek and Wayne Primeau) will be placed on injured reserve.</p>
<p>“It hasn't been an ideal year for him but hopefully he can take advantage whenever we call him up,” Wilson said of Bozak. “We'll give him an opportunity to show us what he can do. He's not a fourth-line guy so if or when we do bring him up, we'll give him quality ice time and play him with good players. That's what he has to do.”</p>
<p>Rookie defenceman Carl Gunnarsson, meanwhile, will likely rejoin the Leafs this week after missing 21 games with an elbow injury, an addition that will mean either Jeff Finger or Garnet Exelby sits as a healthy scratch.</p>
<p>“Maybe [Gunnarsson] will play tomorrow night, but I don't think so,” Wilson said. “I'm expecting him to be ready by Thursday [against the Philadelphia Flyers].</p>
<p>“He's very mobile, he really impresses – he was getting the pucks first. He's a good penalty killer. There's a lot of little things in his game. He's not a sensational player in the sense that he's going to go end-to-end but he makes good first passes and defends very well. Once he's ready, we'll get him in there.”</p>

<p>This recent rush to put full-body scanners in all airports without knowing how people's health will be affected by the radiation reminds me of the hysteria over H1N1, when everyone was urged to be inoculated with a vaccine that was produced in a rush.</p>
<p>The fact that one of the scanners was installed in Kelowna before the recent incident on the airplane makes me think that maybe the failed attack -- a suspiciously amateurish one -- was only a pretext for installing scanners in all airports.</p>
<p>It was as if the scanners had been sitting at airports, ready to be put into action right after Christmas.</p>

</div><div>1073 words</div><div>11 January 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>With Canada on the brink of a federal election in 2010, political leaders should pause to examine the composition of the people who administer our most important democratic institutions. And if they do so critically, party leaders will have to conclude that, for a country that prides itself on its inclusiveness and diversity, Canadians are doing a poor job of reflecting their society in their political ranks.</p>
<p>Consider the representation of women in political office. In the House of Commons, women comprise 22 per cent of elected representatives. Among the provincial and territorial legislatures, women represent 23 per cent of members. And they account for 23 per cent of people on municipal councils in Canada. While these numbers are the best they have ever been, especially in the federal realm, they have barely budged in decades and are entirely inadequate for a country where 52 per cent of the population is female.</p>
<p>Putting the statistics in a global context offers no consolation. Canada ranks 47th in the world for the proportion of women in its national parliament, according to the Inter-Parliamentary Union, behind many poor or troubled countries that could make better excuses for a lack of diversity than Canadians can. Among those ahead of Canada are countries such as Rwanda, South Africa, Angola and Iraq. Canada also ranks far behind countries in Scandinavia, as well as other developed nations like Spain, Germany and Australia.</p>
<p>Some argue that part of the problem lies in getting high-quality women to join the game. The hours are notoriously long, the travel can be daunting, and some women are concerned it will take them away from young families. Politics is also inherently confrontational, requiring a thick skin and an ability to keep your elbows up. And it is high-profile. It attracts far more media criticism than praise, not to mention blistering public denunciations by opponents. Many women – and many men – would rather work in roles that are lower-profile or simply more effective than the frustrating realm of politics.</p>
<p>But that reality is made far worse in the current political climate. Rude, frat-boy antics have become the norm in politics, particularly at the federal level. Certainly anyone contemplating a career in politics would think twice after seeing the hazing that the Liberal MP Carolyn Bennett got in October while trying to ask questions about H1N1 in the House of Commons. As a medical doctor, Ms. Bennett deserved to be allowed to ask questions about vaccination programs for pregnant women without being mocked, jeered and laughed at as she struggled to speak. At one point, Ms. Bennett replied in frustration, “This isn't funny!”</p>
<p>Imagine going to work anywhere else and facing such shamefully disrespectful treatment. It is almost unthinkable.</p>
<p>Even with the difficulties of the job, many women are still ready and willing to tackle the task – if they have the opportunity. Indeed, the political scientist Sylvia Bashevkin dismisses the idea that the uncivil atmosphere in Parliament presents the main barrier to women getting involved in politics. In her new book Women, Power, Politics: The Hidden Story of Canada's Unfinished Democracy, she argues the far bigger problem is the private “discomfort” too many men (and women) feel about putting women in positions of power. Many Canadians may not admit it or even realize it, but they still won't embrace the idea of women as leaders, she argues.</p>
<p>Among her many recommendations, Ms. Bashevkin calls for the return of public funding for women's political organizations such as the National Action Committee on the Status of Women. She also proposes a new requirement for political parties to have a defined quota of women as candidates, as well as the adoption of proportional representation as a way to bolster the number of women elected.</p>
<p>The Ottawa lobby group Equal Voice is pursuing the election of more women on another front, urging political party leaders to adopt voluntary internal quotas for candidate nominations in the next election. Equal Voice has concluded that more profound structural solutions – like proportional representation – are unlikely to be embraced in Canada, given the lack of political support for substantial reforms to the political system.</p>
<p>So the group has decided to tackle a simpler and more realistic reform that recognizes where power lies in the political system – with the all-male party leaders, who have access to funding and political machinery that can provide a huge boost to a favoured candidate. The success of this strategy lies in the fact that promises by party leaders have made a measurable difference. In the most recent federal election, in 2008, for example, Liberal Leader Stéphane Dion pledged to run at least one-third female candidates, and exceeded the target at 37 per cent. The result? Twenty-four per cent of Liberals elected in 2008 were women.</p>
<p>But such voluntary efforts have limits. Notably, the ruling Conservatives nominated just 20 per cent women candidates in 2008. And of those elected, just 16 per cent were women – the worst track record among the major parties. In a press release in late September, Equal Voice complained that with 186 candidates nominated so far for the next federal election (out of 308 in total), the Conservatives had named just 21 per cent women.</p>
<p>To add impetus to bring about change, there are other reforms worth considering. The federal New Democrats, for example, have adopted a nomination process that requires riding associations to actively search for minorities when putting forward candidates – an idea that has been tested in other political realms but deserves wider adoption.</p>
<p>Sheila Gervais, the former national director of the Liberal Party of Canada, has written persuasively that money is the best incentive for compelling change. She has proposed new public financing rules requiring parties to dedicate a portion of the taxpayer-supported financing to improving equitable participation in the system, and has recommended parties receive a special subsidy based on the number of women they get elected. Both ideas would give extra momentum to reform.</p>
<p>Canada elected a record 21 per cent women MPs in 1993, a number that has climbed just one percentage point in the 16 years since. A federal election campaign in 2010 would be the ideal time to move women past that sticky barrier. Canada's party leaders and Canadian voters must make it happen.</p>

<p>Winter cycling dangerous</p>
<p>As a driver of a motor vehicle, I make decisions on when it is safe to drive during the winter months. If conditions are dangerous I change my driving habits, or maybe decide to stay home until conditions improve. But we do not see this happening with cyclists. They still drive on the snowy streets. I have even seen them driving through snow ruts and in snowy conditions. Drivers of motor vehicles must now take care to avoid these cyclists as they take over our streets throughout the entire year.</p>
<p>We must take care not to become victim of these cyclists if they happen to fall in front of us in these icy and snowy conditions. And if this were to happen we would be considered at fault. Not only would we be at fault, but if tragedy occurred we would have to bear the mental anguish associated with it. These cyclists are being allowed to remain on our streets and in our driving lanes while feeling superior by making claims of environmental and fitness benefits.</p>
<p>And as far as Stuart Williams' letter, Winter riding is fun (Jan. 7), where he states cross-country skiing is similar to cycling in the winter, I have yet to see a cross-country skier sharing a designated lane with a bus during rush hour, or thinking they should be on our streets among motor vehicles. Maybe he should stick to the bicycle paths, or take his bicycle down a cross-country ski trail for his daily exercise during the winter months.</p>

<p>Stop blaming the NDP</p>
<p>It would be humorous if it was not so sad to see how the Manitoba Tories blame every problem that occurs in this province on the NDP government. Car theft is a serious problem. The Criminal Code, which sets penalties for car theft, is under federal jurisdiction. The police are city employees, the judges and prosecutors are independent of direct government control. Poverty is a major factor in crime and yet every time car thefts occur, the Manitoba Tory justice critic blames the NDP minister of justice. A child was tragically killed in a house fire on an aboriginal reserve and not immediately reported as missing. The RCMP, the local fire department, local social services and the federal government all have responsibilities in this matter and yet the Tories blame the Manitoba government.</p>
<p>The Tories are now blaming the NDP because not enough Manitobans chose to get the H1N1 vaccine despite its wide availability. The Tories forget to mention that their federal cousins prorogued Parliament for three months, which killed all Criminal Code changes they claimed were so urgent.</p>

<p>Every drop counts</p>
<p>Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen said Premier Greg Selinger's proposal to freeze the pay of MLAs is a drop in the bucket compared with the budget deficit this year. In a deficit position, I think every drop is worth counting. It appears McFadyen has never had to live in a condition where every penny counts and, if he has, he has forgotten what it is like.</p>
<p>He goes on further to say that rather than freezing MLAs' salaries, Selinger should scale down three big-ticket items to control government spending. When he says "rather than," it is obvious that he has tunnel vision and is only thinking of his salary.</p>

<p>Party needs banking lesson</p>
<p>Re: You can count on our banks (Dec. 4).</p>
<p>I found this article a very interesting explanation of why our banks are in such good shape versus banks around the world. It explains why we have been able to withstand the economic downturn as well as we have and apparently recovering relatively quickly. Obviously the supervisor of financial institutions ensures banks do not invest in risky ventures or spend recklessly. They exercise sound fiscal management.</p>
<p>Now if we could just convince the current Manitoba NDP government that we as a province could also be in much better shape with more frugal commitments to financial management, we, too could be in better shape in our future. I refer specifically to commitment to build Hydro lines that will in the future cost us $1 billion more than necessary, spending thousands of dollars to appoint two aboriginal consultants to advise on road construction on the east side of Lake Winnipeg and a list of other spendthrift decisions (not the least being suspending debt-reduction payments).</p>
<p>If families disregarded their finances in a similar fashion, they would all be in bankruptcy court. It is time for someone to realize we are leaving a legacy for our children and grandchildren that will be a millstone around their necks.</p>

<p>What decade is it?</p>
<p>Is it just me or are there others who wonder why 2010 is considered to be the first year of the second decade instead of the last year of the first decade of the 21st century?</p>
<p>I assume the first century AD was year 1-100; second century, 101-200, and so on. If my assumption is correct, then the year 2000 was actually the end of the 20th century and not the beginning of the 21st century or the beginning of the new millennium.</p>
<p>If there is a valid explanation and I am wrong, I will quietly and humbly retire to my corner as a minority of one, or, perhaps I can join the ranks of the unenlightened individuals who are as tired of the phrases 'climate change' and 'global warming' as I am.</p>

<p>All war immoral</p>
<p>Re: When war was war (Jan. 6). I am not surprised that Omar Bradley, a U.S. five-star general known as the "GI's general" and field commander of 1.3 million men during the Second World War, once said: "As far as I am concerned, war itself is immoral."</p>

<p>Canadian pride deflated</p>
<p>There was a time when Canadians felt proud to be citizens of a country that led the world at peacekeeping, promoting human rights and other good works. Canadians were regarded as all-around good guys. Do you remember when we displayed the Maple Leaf on our luggage, smugly proclaiming our citizenship? Almost overnight this precious reputation has been squandered. I believe it all began with the Harper government.</p>
<p>Whenever our prime minister goes abroad we have come to expect that he will embarrass us with his pious hectoring and abusing the world stage to further his cheap partisan politics. Even our once-coveted Canadian passport doesn't seem to count for much anymore.</p>
<p>After weeks of denial and coverup it is obvious this government is implicated in overlooking torture of enemy combatants, an act considered a war crime by many. At Copenhagen, Canada was accused of being the world's worst polluter and the least willing to adopt policies required to combat climate change. I have removed the Maple Leafs from my luggage, but I shall keep them in storage and pray for the day when once again we can hold our heads high and quietly declare: Yes! I am Canadian.</p>

<p>In defence of oilsands</p>
<p>Get your head out of the sand regarding the impact of the Canadian oilsands on the environment. Allow me to do the math for you: Canadian oilsands' CO2 emissions are 0.17 per cent of the U.S. coal industry and 0.08 per cent of China's total CO2 emissions. Canada's supposed "dirty oil" is an insignificant drop in the bucket compared to the Americans' very dirty coal and to China's very dirty air.</p>
<p>Oil and gas made up 21 per cent of Canada's exports in 2006 and is at the top of the list of all Canadian exports. Think of it this way: Every Canadian across the country (from St. John's to Victoria) must recognize that 21 per cent of each dollar you have in your account or wallet has gotten there because of oil and gas exports from B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Nova Scotia and Newfoundland.</p>

<p>Tiger treated differently</p>
<p>John Daly spent most of 2009 watching the PGA, as he had been suspended for "conduct unbecoming a PGA player." What did he do? It seems he spent his time during a rain delay drinking beer in the Hooter's tent. Surely that is not against the law, and he was probably not the only player in there. Then after the rain delay, he took a friend as his caddy for the rest of the round. Big deal!</p>
<p>Now why isn't Tiger Woods suspended for "conduct unbecoming a PGA player?" Maybe because he brings in millions of fans and dollars for the PGA every year. His conduct is at least as bad as anything John Daly did.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Apathetic Leaf fans are a silent majority; 'I'm as frustrated as they are,' says GM Burke of supporters as team continues to slide</b>

<p>Internet petitions get things done. One forced U.S. President Barack Obama to change his schedule so that the State of the Union address did not delay the season premiere of Lost. Another by fans of the TV show Chuck saved it from cancellation.</p>
<p>Now the collective voice of fans venting their frustrations electronically through blogs, twitter, fan-posts and the like is up against a seemingly immovable force: the Toronto Maple Leafs.</p>
<p>"Our fans have to understand I'm as frustrated as they are," said GM Brian Burke. "Way more so."</p>
<p>If there's change to come, it won't be the coach. Ron Wilson's job is "100 per cent safe," said Burke.</p>
<p>Change is more likely to come in the form of call-ups - Tyler Bozak and Jay Rosehill at the top of the list - followed by trades.</p>
<p>"I've been moving heaven and earth on the trade front for some time, I would be more concerned if there were deals going down all around me. There aren't," said Burke. "We've looked at call-ups. No one at this point has kicked down the door to the point where we have to give them a recall. Bozak and Rosehill have been strong the last couple of games, so we'll think about giving them a look."</p>
<p>Fans of a team on a 2-6-2 slide are understandably frustrated, but have yet to entirely throw in the towel. One site, boycotttheleafs at ipetition.com, is urging fans to stay away from the Air Canada Centre, to send a message that fans are sick and tired of losing. As of Sunday, there were only 18 signatures.</p>
<p>Another that launched last week, befairtothefans.com, boasts 1,840 members. It's calling for a reduction in the price of tickets.</p>
<p>Even on the official Leaf website, under the fan forum section, there was talk of a boycott. But only when Vesa Toskala starts.</p>
<p>At tmlboycott.com, fans are being asked to target team sponsors. But on Sunday at midday there was only one person - this reporter - scanning the site. If the blogosphere is not exactly organized, it doesn't mean fans are happy. The comments section of news sites are filled with frustrations:</p>
<p>"Boring, depressing and demoralizing," said one fan on thestar.com.</p>
<p>"My doc can't figure out if I have H1N1 or not - I seem to get really sick Saturday nights while watching the Leafs," another posted on TSN.ca</p>
<p>On a <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> site devoted to the Maple Leafs, one fan had this to say after the loss to the Penguins: "The bottom line is money. That's why they will never win, because they are making money."</p>
<p>The danger for the Leafs may not be boycotts - it may be fan apathy. The last playoff game at the Air Canada Centre was in 2004, and it doesn't look like there will be one this year. That's six seasons and a generation of kids - age 8 to 13 - have little or no memory of what it's like to cheer for the home team in the playoffs.</p>
<p>"Burke and (assistant Dave) Nonis have not even had truly a full year to get the team turned around," said MLSE president Richard Peddie. "The fans we talk to don't like the losing but want us to steady the course and be patient. We understand the fan unrest. It also says they really care."</p>

<p>What animals can help spread flu viruses? Two wildlife disease experts examined which species might act as reservoirs for influenza viruses and be "mixing vessels" in which new strains are generated. They analyzed complex carbohydrates found on the surface membranes of cells, which can act as "receptors" for influenza viruses.</p>
<p>Mark Schrenzel and Bruce Rideout already knew H5N1, the avian strain of influenza, makes use of receptors containing an alpha 2,3 sialic-acid linkage, whereas H1N1 strains employ the alpha 2,6 sialic-acid bond. They also knew any species (domesticated swine being one) that carries receptors of both types could act as a mixing vessel. They set out to find which animals have what, focusing on species likely to meet waterfowl like geese and ducks, known to be vulnerable to H5N1. The researchers analyzed the receptors of 60 species. - The Economist</p>

<p>What's ahead for 2010?</p>
<p>From up-and-coming hot spots to a virtual explosion of travel-related technology innovations, here's a look at what experts are predicting to be the most popular travel trends next year.</p>
<p>1. Iceland</p>
<p>Iceland is more accessible than ever, says Anna Banas, executive editor of Smarter-Travel.com--it's a six-hour flight from New York.</p>
<p>Reykjavik, the capital, is "very hip," with a surprisingly robust nightlife scene. Natural wonders abound outside the city.</p>
<p>And now is the time to plan a trip--a massive economic crisis there has sent traditionally expensive hotel rates and other travel costs plummeting. Come June, a new low-cost carrier, Iceland Express, will begin daily nonstop service between Newark International and Reykjavik.</p>
<p>2. Thailand</p>
<p>Long considered an attractive destination for first-time travellers to Southeast Asia, experts say Thailand is becoming even more mainstream.</p>
<p>"It's exotic and it's unknown," says Debra Kalsmith-Sternberg, a senior agent at Liberty Travel in Bay Shore, N.Y. She's seen a recent spike of interest from her clients, who are taking trips -- all at a very favourable exchange rate.</p>
<p>3. Germany</p>
<p>Named one of three "European Cultural Capitals" for 2010, the city of Essen and the surrounding Ruhr region are awash in celebrations, festivals and new attractions that are expected to draw lots of tourists to Germany. What's more, <span class="companylink">Continental Airlines</span> begins new daily nonstop service from Newark, N.J., to Munich in March.</p>
<p>4. Las Vegas</p>
<p>Super-low hotel rates should continue into 2010, says Orbitz.comspokeswoman Jeanenne Tornatore. Sweetening the pot is the opening of CityCenter, a large complex on the Strip with several hotels, high-end shopping and entertainment.</p>
<p>5. Mexico</p>
<p>Swine flu fears may have wreaked havoc on the country's image this year, but Cancun still topped Orbitz.com'smost popular international destinations for 2009 (the Riviera Maya region and Los Cabos also ranked in the top eight). And, cities visited most frequently by tourists actually had fewer reported cases of the H1N1 virus than many U.S. locations.</p>

</p>
<p>With H1N1 in its pocket and the cold and flu season still to come, the Jean Coutu Group expects a much-improved 2010 as it continues to revamp and expand its pharmacies.</p>
<p>The Longueuil-based company yesterday reported a net income of $44.6 million in the third quarter, a far cry from the $399.2 million loss it saw during the same period a year ago, when it was still feeling the pain of its ill-fated venture into owning and operating a large chain of U.S. drug stores.</p>
<p>Revenue for the 13 weeks ended Nov. 28, rose to $678.1 million from $620.3 million, spurred by a number of factors, said company president François Coutu. There's no doubt concern over the H1N1 flu virus helped, spurring sales of different over-the-counter products such as hand sanitizers, he said, and cold and flu season will prompt sales in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Revenues were also helped by the company's 40th birthday sales which brought in a lot of shoppers, expansion of its private label line and improved sales of its two-year-old generic drug manufacturing division.</p>
<p>But a key factor was the addition of new stores - about a dozen so far this year - and the renovation and relocation of existing stores. The expanded stores - including 14 in the last quarter - usually have larger, spiffier beauty sections with their lucrative product lines.</p>
<p>"We're on a roll," Coutu said in an interview. The company has a good concept "that goes well with the up and downs of the economy" and good capitalization and is hoping to grow by about 100 stores in five years. "We're working hard at this," he said.</p>
<p>At the end of the quarter the company had 366 stores in Quebec, New Brunswick and Ontario.</p>
<p>Its generic drug division stands to benefit from a number of key drugs - such as Lipitor, the widely-used cholesterol treatment - losing their patent protection in the next few years, leaving them open to generic competition.</p>
<p>And the aging population is expected to spur an increase in the consumption of prescription medications.</p>
<p>The company has also finished writing down all the losses associated with its investment in the <span class="companylink">Rite Aid</span> chain of drug stores in the U.S. It still holds about 250 million shares in the company, "so everything now should be hopefully a plus," he said. "We still believe there are better times to come, especially with health care reform in the U.S. that should be good for the drug store business."</p>
<p>The company's A shares were trading up 32 cents, or about three per cent, at $10.05 yesterday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange.</p>

<p>The H1N1 flu outbreak gave pharmacy chain Jean Coutu a boost as the Montreal-area company said its revenue for the three months ended Nov. 28 improved to $678.1 million from $620.3 million a year earlier. The pharmacy chain earned $44.6 million in the quarter, or 19 cents per share. It lost $399.2 million, or $1.66 per share, a year earlier.</p>

</p>
<p>Runner-up. Silver medallist. Second-place finisher.</p>
<p>Ever since the controversial <span class="companylink">Nike</span> commercial at the 1996 Atlanta Olympics -- you don't win silver, you lose gold -- coming second has sometimes been derided as a loser's position.</p>
<p>For a group of Canadian figure skaters, however, a silver medal at next week's senior nationals and Olympic trials in London, Ont., will shine almost as brightly as gold.</p>
<p>Canada has two Olympic berths in each of the four figure skating disciplines. There's an overwhelming favourite in three of the four competitions, with Patrick Chan, Joannie Rochette and the dance team of Tessa Virtue and Scott Moir. But the scramble for those runner-up spots -and with it those coveted Olympic berths -promises to be an all-out war.</p>
<p>Although they no longer compete for B.C. due to moves east for training purposes, there's a good chance that at least one of Kelowna's Craig Buntin and Dawson Creek's Cody Hay will earn an Olympic qualifier in pairs.</p>
<p>The other hot spot for B.C. skaters is men's singles where two of Canada's up-and-comers -Kevin Reynolds and Jeremy Ten -figure to be squarely in the mix for the No. 2 berth behind Chan.</p>
<p>"Of course, the Olympics has always been my dream," says Ten, a 20-year-old from Vancouver. "But I realize if I don't make it this year I've still got a long run still ahead of me."</p>
<p>"The No. 2 spot seems wide open," adds Reynolds, 19, from Coquitlam. "To me, in men's there doesn't seem to be much of a difference between the No. 2 and No. 5 [ranked skaters]."</p>
<p>Based purely on the results from this season's senior Grand Prix circuit, national team veteran Shawn Sawyer of Edmundston, N.B., appears to have the inside track for the second men's Olympic berth. He's produced the best result -a second at Skate America -of all the Canadian men's skaters this year, including Chan. But his 203.9 point total in winning that silver is still less than the 204.89 points Reynolds put up in finishing fourth at the same event the previous year.</p>
<p>Neither Ten nor Reynolds have enjoyed the Grand Prix seasons they were hoping for, with extenuating circumstances in the case of Reynolds due to illness. Both, however, have been training hard at the 8-Rinks Centre of Excellence, hoping to lay down their best performances of the season.</p>
<p>"My Grand Prixs were a disappointment," admits Ten, who scored a 10th at the NHK event in Japan and a 12th at Skate Canada. "But the training has been going well and I'm feeling good. This year has been a learning experience."</p>
<p>"The Grand Prixs are kind of a warm-up to the season," adds Reynolds, who came down with the flu en route to the Cup of China in Beijing. He finished eighth there and was quarantined for day by Chinese officials as an H1N1 suspect. "The nationals are the big one."</p>
<p>They are big, too, for Mira Leung, who's waiting in the wings for the favourites to falter in the senior women's competition. The 20-year-old Vancouver competitor slipped to sixth in Canada last year and had a disappointing ninth-place finish at the recent East-West Challenge in Toronto. She is, however, a three-time Canadian silver medallist.</p>
<p>ICE CHIPS: The junior nationals are also being held in London just before the senior competition and Burnaby's 11-year-old Nam Nguyen is out to make more history. Canada's youngest ever champion when he won the national juvenile title at age 8, Nguyen will be going for his fourth Canadian title in as many years when he competes in junior men's. If he wins, Nguyen won't be eligible for junior worlds, where the minimum age is 13. B.C. senior women's champion Kathryn Kang of North Vancouver is an alternate in the senior women's event. She'll make the trip east with Team B.C. if there's a late withdrawal.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Developing nations' pandemic: The car; A person living in a poor country is twice as likely to die on the roads as one in a rich country</b>
</div><div>Peter Dauvergne, Laura Lee and Miro Cernetig   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>890 words</div><div>9 January 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>C4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Millions of Canadians spent 2009 lining up for a shot of the H1N1 vaccine, hoping for protection from a flu pandemic. What few realize is another pandemic is now raging across the world, one that if left unchecked will kill more young adults than H1N1, malaria, tuberculosis or AIDS. It's the automobile.</p>
<p>It started on an August afternoon in 1896. Bridget Driscoll became the first person to be killed by an automobile, run over by a demonstration "motorcar" in the United Kingdom, travelling at the speed of 4 m.p.h. The coroner, reflecting on the jury's verdict of "accidental death," said he hoped "such a thing would never happen again."</p>
<p>But such a thing has happened, again and again, killing at least 30 million people and perhaps as many as 60 million to 90 million people. On an average day, automobiles now kill more than 800 people and injure as many as 34,000 every six hours -- the time it took the Driscoll jury to return its verdict.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization now ranks traffic accidents as the leading cause of death for young people between the ages of 15 and 29. By 2020, automobiles will kill 1.9 million people each year. Within five years of today, the automobile will be the No. 1 killer of children aged five to 14. In short, the automobile has become the 21st century's technological pandemic.</p>
<p>Where the car is most deadly, however, is in the world's poorest countries, now embracing the car culture at a rapid pace. In Canada, from 2,800 to 2,900 people die in car accidents every year, a rate of a little under 10 per 100,000 people. In contrast, Africa, now a rising market for car manufacturers, has a death rate of more than 28 per 100,000 people-and it's climbing.</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization: "Over 90 per cent of the world's fatalities on the roads now occur in low-income and middle-income countries, which have only 48 per cent of the world's registered vehicles."</p>
<p>Dr. Kevin Watkins, at Oxford's Global Economic Governance Program, calls it nothing short of an international emergency: "We are confronted by an epidemic that kills and maims on the scale of major infectious diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and HIV-AIDS. If civilians were killed in a conflict on the scale that they are killed on the world's roads, international condemnation and calls for action would be guaranteed."</p>
<p>We've seen this deadly cycle before.</p>
<p>In fact, Canadians have already lived through the height of this technological pandemic. In the 1970s, Canada's death rate from the auto peaked--as it did in Europe and the United States -- at more than 30 fatalities per 100,000, the death rate many African countries are now approaching.</p>
<p>Today, a person living in a poor country is twice as likely to die on the road as one in a rich country. Why are we letting this happen?</p>
<p>From their own histories, leaders of the world's developed economies know supplying automobiles to an expanding middle class without careful controls will cause a dramatic rise in death rates.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, laws and regulations have been introduced to reduce the death rate. Among the most effective: better roads, speed limits, mandatory seatbelt laws, education programs and stiff penalties to prevent driving under the influence of alcohol.</p>
<p>Identifying the car as a pandemic for emerging economies is the right thing to do on humanitarian grounds and the sensible thing to do on economic ones.</p>
<p>For developing countries, the growing carnage from the automobile is causing terrible hardship, with the economic costs alone countering much of the efforts of the world's foreign aid. The facts are irrefutable, concludes the Commission for Global Road Safety: road crashes cost developing countries up to $100 billion a year, equal to all overseas aid from OECD countries. Road deaths and injuries typically cut emerging economies' GDP from 1 to 3 per cent a year, pushing them deeper into poverty.</p>
<p>The Commission for Global Road Safety, backed by such luminaries as Nobel Peace Prize laureate Desmond Tutu, wants action on our century's technological pandemic. They are urging the United Nations and world leaders to make the next 10 years "a decade of action for road safety." The goal is to reduce automobile deaths by 50 per cent.</p>
<p>Canada and other developed economies should embrace this initiative as a foreign-policy resolution for 2010. Giving other nations the tools to counter this technological pandemic will save at least five million lives by the end of the decade.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The Middle Ages are upon us again; Various eras catch on at particular times in history and a new period has caught our fancy</b>
</div><div>Philip Hensher   </div>
<div>Daily Telegraph</div>
<div>1522 words</div><div>9 January 2010</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>B5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>-Why, at different times, do readers start showing an interest in one period of history rather than another?</p>
<p>Ten years ago, the fashion in fiction, history, film and television dramatizations seemed to lie between the late Georgian period and the late Victorian -from Amanda Foreman's The Duchess and Alan Bennett's The Madness of King George to Sarah Waters's Victorian romps. A couple of years ago, everything was Austerity Chic, and you could hardly move in a bookshop for some tale of rationing, fish curry and hard winters.</p>
<p>It's never easy to account for fashion, but perhaps some real factors have contributed to the reading matter of 2010. This last year has seen a worldwide fear of a destructive plague, in the shape of swine flu.</p>
<p>In Britain, the court of our leader has grown increasingly suspicious, withdrawn and riddled with the sort of plots usually termed "Byzantine." The coffers are empty, and an expensive foreign war against parts of the Muslim world has to be paid for somehow.</p>
<p>It all sounds a little bit medieval, and that is what we've been reading about. The recession has made us regress, or at least seek answers in the past.</p>
<p>Other disasters have been weighing heavily on our minds, and refer back directly to the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>In the climate-change debate, both skeptics and proponents have spent a lot of time debating the significance for our own times of two parts of the period.</p>
<p>The first is what has been termed the Medieval Warm Period, from 800 to 1300; the second, the Little Ice Age that followed it.</p>
<p>Those in the George Monbiot camp, which blames humans for climate change, have spent a lot of heated discussion dwelling on these facts, and the debate has found its way into creative works in surprising ways. We think about future catastrophe as a consequence of our past sins in very medieval ways.</p>
<p>Publishing success</p>
<p>Two remarkable publishing successes of the past year have pointed toward a growing taste for a period often thought of as difficult, remote and unattractive.</p>
<p>The historian Maureen Waller says that she was once told that the public wanted "nothing early, nothing medieval..." That has certainly changed in the past year or two.</p>
<p>Almost from the moment it was published, Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall gained huge public enthusiasm. It treated the early Tudor period very much as a seamless continuation of the Middle Ages, and has been one of the most popular winners of the Booker Prize for years, currently enjoying top place on the hardback bestseller list.</p>
<p>Some cognoscenti complained that all the books on the shortlist were historical works; the panel went for the one set in the remotest period, and crowned a popular winner. In some ways, it seems surprising.</p>
<p>Skeptics may point out that a novel set so far in the past could never have historically accurate dialogue, for a start, because readers would be unlikely to be able to understand authentic 15th-or 16th-century speech. That concern seems to have Karen Maitland whose Black-Death themed novel, Company of Liars, came out in February, and the well-regarded Philippa Gregory. Her new novel, The White Queen, takes on Edward IV's Queen, Elizabeth Woodville, who is, incidentally, one of the subjects of that lovely classic, Josephine Tey's The Daughter of Time.</p>
<p>There have always been novelists who take on these subjects for a popular audience. One thinks of the prolific Jean Plaidy or Nigel Tranter or, on a higher level, Sylvia Townsend Warner's wonderful The Corner That Held Them from 1947, about life in a medieval convent. These new, popular, historical novelists are not necessarily much more sophisticated, but they have a definite air of fashion about them.</p>
<p>Novelists and filmmakers, too, who do not explicitly use medieval settings are clearly drawn to the sometimes horrifying medieval imagery. publishing success is not fiction, but a work of history that draws on fictional techniques.</p>
<p>David Miller, the London agent, who next year publishes his own historical novel, Today, told me that he is seeing a good deal of crossover, in the form of historians writing novels set in their period of expertise. And historians are showing some interest in fictional techniques.</p>
<p>Ian Mortimer, the largely unknown historian and author of the slow-burning, unlikely word-of-mouth success The Time Traveller's Guide To Mediaeval Britain, published in 2008 and now at the top of the paperback bestseller list, says that he is interested in "new literary models, such as writing about the past in the present tense"--just like Hilary Mantel.</p>
<p>Publishers have noticed an increase in readers' interest in the medieval period.</p>
<p>Stuart Proffitt of Penguin singles out two books of theirs that considerably exceeded expectations --Chris Wickham's The Inheritance of Rome about Europe from 400 to 1000, and Judith Herrin's Byzantium. A successful exhibition can feed a reader's interest, even in an abstruse topic, and Herrin, whose book has sold more than 25,000 to date, may have benefited from a very popular Byzantine exhibition at the Royal Academy.</p>
<p>The considerable popular and</p>
<p>Movie images</p>
<p>stopped bothering serious novelists.</p>
<p>Novels set in the medieval or early Tudor period have never stopped being published, or being read.</p>
<p>The Pillars of the Earth, Ken Follett's popular epic about the 11th-century building of a cathedral, was published as long ago as 1989; last year, he published World Without End, an enormous sequel set in the 14th century, which had considerable sales.</p>
<p>Other popular writers include</p>
<p>Cormac McCarthy's The Road and its new film, set after a global holocaust, suggest Brueghellike brutality, desperate cannibalism and filth, as the survivors enact lawless brutality and descend to hideous depravity more characteristic of the 14th century than, so far, the 21st.</p>
<p>The second surprisingly substantial critical success of the Victoria and Albert Museum's new Medieval and Renaissance galleries, opened late last year, clearly reflected a current enthusiasm. It is fair to say that Proffitt is skeptical about medieval works forming an especial trend, pointing to works on ancient history by Robin Lane Fox or Mary Beard which "have done as well or better." Perhaps, as Proffitt says, it all comes down to a brilliant writer as well as a fascinating period.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, studies which, a couple of years ago, would have been regarded as material for specialists are today finding a general readership. Jonathan Sumption's multi-volume history of the Hundred Years War is by any standards austere, unforgiving and, one imagines, probably the cause of commercial despair in a publisher (two volumes, by repute, contracted for; three volumes published; four more, as rumour has it, to come). His third volume made a surprising number of appearances in Books of the Year supplements at the end of last year. John Hatcher and Benedict Gummer have both written studies of the Black Death in the past two years, one from the point of view of a single village, the other a more general account, like Philip Ziegler's classic 1971 study. Eamon Duffy's much-acclaimed history of a single medieval village, The Voices of Morebath0, was perhaps a little bit ahead of its time in 2002.</p>
<p>What seems absolutely clear is that readers are seeking vivid, accurate accounts of the individual experience. What was it like to live in fear of damnation, plague and the king? And audiences are happy to find out from Hilary Mantel, from the Victoria and Albert's new display or from Ian Mortimer's inventive history. Maureen Waller told me, very truly, that, "the great knack is to make readers feel that they were there." L.P. Hartley said that "the past is a foreign country"; and, like most foreign countries, it gets easier and easier to travel there, to compare our daily experience with theirs.</p>

<p>Suddenly, Nancy Kosik's etiquette classes have become more complicated.</p>
<p>The consultant offers workshops in etiquette and protocol for students, business executives and politicians, in Montreal and Ottawa. Among the basics to be mastered is the handshake, the age-old ritual for meeting, greeting, parting, thanking and congratulating.</p>
<p>These days, fears of contracting the H1N1 influenza virus have many people squirming, recoiling, nodding and waving -- anything to avoid shaking hands.</p>
<p>Kosik said she understands their concerns. She makes hand-sanitizing dispensers available at all her classes. She keeps miniature bottles in her coat, her purse, in the car and at home.</p>
<p>Kosik said she lauds all the new-found attention being paid to hygiene. But it's bad manners to refuse an extended hand without offering an adequate excuse. And in most situations, a wave, a nod or a fist-bump is not an adequate equivalent.</p>
<p>"In so many social and business situations, handshaking is extremely important. It's a way of showing respect, of saying it's a pleasure or an honour to meet you."</p>
<p>Refusing to shake hands, she said, might be construed as a sign of disinterest, insensitivity or discomfort. Indeed, the handshake is such a powerful symbol that the first to proffer his or her hand subconsciously assumes the leadership role in even the briefest interaction, Kosik said.</p>
<p>But what to do if you've been coughing and hacking, or if the other person shows signs of sniffling and snorting, or if you know someone's hygiene is subpar?</p>
<p>Kosik's advice is to acknowledge the non-handshaking right off the bat. Say something like: "I'd love to shake hands, but I think I'm coming down with something. I don't want to put you at risk."</p>
<p>Or try this: "I see you're a little stuffed up and my immune system is a little weak. Sorry if I don't shake hands."</p>
<p>Say it even if it's a little white lie, she counselled. "In proper etiquette, you never make others feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p>But what if it's the boss or an important client and the handshake is unavoidable? Shake hands, then get out the hand sanitizer as soon as you're out of sight.</p>

<p>Dundas, Ont. -- I took comfort from reading Judith Timson's column It's Time To Break Our Fear Addiction (Life, Jan. 8). She admitted that the media are, in part, to blame for their constant sky-is-falling refrain. Nevertheless, she advised us to say things such as “but, of course,” as the French do in the face of disaster, and to be aware that, no matter how often we fly, statistics show we are likely to survive. I actually began to feel better.</p>
<p>Then I turned a page and found this blaring headline: Passengers In Economy Class Have Higher Risk Of Catching H1N1. Good grief, I was back where I started. But nice try, Ms. Timson.</p>

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- Fame seems to be just the ticket for beating the interminable new lineups at Canadian airports.</p>
<p>Hollywood actress Halle Berry sailed past hundreds of passengers waiting to clear U.S. customs at Montreal's Trudeau Airport on Monday, thanks to a personal escort from a uniformed Montreal police officer.</p>
<p>Police say the officer acted improperly and the department's no-favouritism policy will be rigorously enforced. But the actress's fast-track treatment has struck a nerve about privilege at a time of wearying air travel for the ordinary masses.</p>
<p>Only two months ago, some Canadian hockey players came under criticism when they jumped the queue to get speedy H1N1 vaccinations. Now the latest status symbol may be the ability to skip the queues at airports, which have grown since the attempted Christmas Day bombing on a <span class="companylink">Northwest Airlines</span> flight to Detroit.</p>
<p>Ms. Berry's VIP treatment was spotted by a freelance journalist who had been in line for an hour, waiting to clear U.S. customs to catch her Air Canada flight to Los Angeles. Mariève Paradis says she spotted Ms. Berry go by, accompanied by her 22-month-old daughter and her Quebec-born partner, model Gabriel Aubry.</p>
<p>When Ms. Paradis finally passed through customs and reached the gate with minutes to go, an Air Canada employee “not very politely” reprimanded her for being late, she says. Ms. Paradis arrived at the airport almost three hours before her flight, only to face numerous security hurdles.</p>
<p>“I wouldn't have been late if I was Halle Berry,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Paradis says she is not out to sully Ms. Berry's reputation, but is irked by the police escort she received.</p>
<p>“In the wake of a near-terrorist attack and with all the increased security measures, don't the police have something better to do than escort celebrities?” she said from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Inspector Jimmy Cacchione, head of the 36-member Montreal police unit at Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport, said Mr. Aubry approached the officer. He explained he was with Halle Berry, the couple were late for their flight and they had a child. The officer acted on his own and accompanied them to the front of the line.</p>
<p>The couple had about 45 minutes to go before their 8:10 a.m. flight, Insp. Cacchione said. The couple were flying business class.</p>
<p>There are legitimate reasons sometimes for whisking air travellers to the front of the line – those with crying babies, for example, or celebrities causing a disruption because they're being besieged for autographs, Insp. Cacchione said. That wasn't the case for Ms. Berry, however. Nor did the Oscar-winning actress have a Nexus pass to speed her through.</p>
<p>“If she had a Nexus pass, I would have had a very different day today,” he said.</p>
<p>Some VIPs do have access to specialized service at Canadian airports. Trudeau airport mandates a Montreal service, Services d'accueil aux visiteurs de marque (Reception services for VIPs), to offer “personalized reception service” for visitors right after they de-plane. Company official Martin Lalumière said he sometimes get requests from celebrities seeking to avoid Canadian customs lines. They're told to forget about it.</p>
<p>“We can't offer any privileges when they arrive in the country,” Mr. Lalumière said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Religion stories in '09 that made waves -</b>
</div><div>John Longhurst   </div>
<div>963 words</div><div>9 January 2010</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>H13</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>What were the top religion stories in 2009? Here are a few that made the news last year, along with one that didn't -- but should have.</p>
<p>1. Roman Catholics invite Anglicans to come on over. In October the Vatican issued an unprecedented invitation to disaffected Anglicans, including married priests, to join the Roman Catholic Church and to keep their own liturgy. Members of both churches are trying to understand the implications: What would it mean for Catholics if married Anglican priests are allowed to serve, but Catholic priests must be celibate? And will the offer undo decades of Catholic-Anglican relations by encouraging schism in the Anglican Church? The years ahead will be interesting for Catholics and Anglicans alike.</p>
<p>2. Homosexuality and religion. Homosexuality was in the news in summer when the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America voted to permit non-celibate gays and lesbians to become clergy. In November, Episcopalians in California elected their first openly lesbian bishop. This is an issue we can expect to hear more about in 2010 and beyond; more liberal attitudes towards homosexuality on the part of many younger people, including many churchgoers, means that all churches will wrestle with it sooner or later. As veteran Dallas Morning News religion reporter Rod Dreher wrote last August: "The demographic wave on homosexuality is real, and it's going to impact conservative churches in a big way over the coming decades."</p>
<p>3. Decline in denominational loyalty. A Pew Forum study released last April showed that 44 per cent of American adults have changed churches at least once. Another study, by Ellison Research, found that seven out of 10 U.S. churchgoers were open to switching denominations. Similar studies have not been conducted in Canada, but I suspect the results would not be very different.</p>
<p>For faith groups, this means coming to terms with the fact that their members have many options when it comes to religion. This is especially true for youth, who are more fluid about doctrine and other issues than previous generations. Over the next few years faith groups -- and schools and ministries built on the notion of denominational loyalty -- will face growing challenges to define themselves, and to find new ways to get additional members and dollars in the larger religious marketplace.</p>
<p>4. The recession. The economic crisis hit many denominations and church-related ministries hard. Giving to most groups was down, even as the numbers of people needing assistance rose. Will giving return to pre-crisis levels when the recession ends, or will groups will have to rethink their mission and goals in the future?</p>
<p>5. H1N1. Fortunately, the pandemic was not as bad as feared. But worries about the illness prompted some faith groups to create pandemic preparation plans, while many changed practices such as passing of the peace and communion. Meanwhile, hand sanitizers are now as common in many churches as offering baskets.</p>
<p>6. Funding cutbacks to Kairos. Last month Immigration Minister Jason Kenney told a conference in Jerusalem that the federal government would cut back funding to Kairos, a social justice group supported by 11 Canadian denominations, as part of a government plan to curb anti-Semitism. The decision raises a troubling question: Do aid organizations have the freedom to criticize Canadian policy if they want government funding? It's causing particular anxiety for groups working in the Middle East, who wonder if the government is expanding the definition of anti-Semitism to include any criticism of Israel.</p>
<p>And will it stop there? What about groups that are critical of the Alberta oilsands or Canada's position on climate change? For religious organizations, which often feel called to stand in solidarity with oppressed people, the government's action is worrisome.</p>
<p>Other stories that received attention in 2009 included U.S. President Barack Obama's declaration in Cairo that the U.S. is not at war with Islam; the release of Caritas in Veritate by Pope Benedict XVI, an encyclical that applies Catholic social-justice teaching to economics; the vote in Switzerland to ban the building of minarets; and the terrible clergy sex abuse scandal in Ireland.</p>
<p>One major story that didn't receive much mainstream coverage involved changes in leadership for American evangelicalism. The stepping down of James Dobson as chair of Focus on the Family in the U.S. in February, together with his leaving his radio show in October, signalled what some consider to be the waning days of America's religious right.</p>
<p>Together with Jerry Falwell, James Kennedy and Pat Robertson, Dobson helped lead conservative American Christians into American political and cultural life. Falwell and Kennedy both died in 2007, and Pat Robertson retired as head of the <span class="companylink">Christian Broadcasting</span> Network that same year. Dobson and the others are being replaced by a new generation of American evangelical leaders who are deeply committed to their faith, but who seem much less strident and doctrinaire.</p>
<p>One of the most prominent of the new evangelical leaders is Rick Warren, pastor of the Saddleback mega-church in California. Warren could not be further from the us-against-them mentality promoted by some of the previous generation of American evangelical leaders. In 2008, he said the following at the annual conference of the Muslim Public Affairs Council: "I love Muslims. I also happen to love Hindus and Jews and Buddhists. Now this one will shock, I happen to love Democrats and Republicans. And for the media's purpose, I happen to love gays and straights ... we don't have to see eye to eye to walk hand in hand."</p>
<p>What will 2010 bring? I hope there are more stories of how people of faith walk hand in hand.</p>

</p>
<p>Shocked neighbours who watched an ambulance leave an Oshawa bungalow in silence Tuesday knew it was bad news. But they had no idea the vehicle carried a slain toddler.</p>
<p>"When the ambulance left, you knew that somebody had died because they didn't put the siren on," said Ashley Black, 21, who lives nearby on Southgate Dr., in the city's south end.</p>
<p>A false alarm followed a couple of days later, suggesting the tragedy might be related to H1N1.</p>
<p>But residents learned the horrible truth Friday, when a 26-year-old man was charged with second-degree murder in the death of a 21/2-year-old boy who lived in the basement apartment.</p>
<p>Black said they barely knew that the young woman who moved in last summer had a little child.</p>
<p>"The kid was never outside. We never saw a child playing," said Ashley's mother, Brenda, adding that residents on the quiet, friendly street knew little about the woman who lived there, apparently with her boyfriend.</p>
<p>News of the arrest Friday afternoon marked an abrupt turn of events. Media reports on Thursday about the toddler's death and that of a 9-year-old Oshawa girl who had died the same day led to "misinformation and speculation," Dr. William Lucas, regional supervising coroner for Durham Region, told the Star.</p>
<p>Lucas called both deaths "sudden and unexpected," but said the two cases are not related.</p>
<p>Autopsies completed Thursday confirmed flu was not a factor in the boy's death and unlikely to be related to the 9-year-old's case either, he said.</p>
<p>The cause of the girl's death has not been determined pending further test results.</p>
<p>Emergency personnel found the boy dead in the house after responding to a 911 call just before noon Tuesday. A 26-year-old man "associated with the deceased" was also there, Durham Region police said.</p>
<p>Following the man's appearance in court on Friday, a publication ban was issued on the identities of both the accused and victim.</p>
<p>Residents on Southgate Dr. said police have been on the scene around the clock since Tuesday.</p>
<p>Ashley Black watched from her driveway as the ambulance arrived that day, followed by police, then fire trucks.</p>
<p>"At first they couldn't get inside the house. They were all just standing around until the firefighters went in."</p>
<p>After the ambulance left about two hours later, police brought out a young man and woman, she said.</p>
<p>"They didn't seem upset and they weren't handcuffed."</p>
<p>Other neighbours said they believed the couple, who had kept a low profile, had only been together a short time.</p>
<p>"I felt sick," Grant Mabee said of his reaction when he learned a child had been killed.</p>
<p>"When the ambulance left with its lights on but no sirens we were all thinking the worst, and, of course, it was."</p>
<p>Brenda Black said she felt bad for the owners of the house, who have rented out their basement apartment for years.</p>
<p>"They're nice, nice people," she said.</p>
<p>"When (the man) came home, police couldn't tell him what was going on. They've gone away now."</p>
<p>A police officer at the house late Friday called it a "sad, tragic case."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quebec ducks third wave; H1N1 campaign; Mass vaccinations quell infections</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>475 words</div><div>8 January 2010</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>A dreaded third wave of H1N1 infections has probably been averted in Quebec because of the high rate of vaccinations that took place before Christmas, the province's top public health official said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We will have some sporadic cases, but not a third wave," Alain Poirier told reporters.</p>
<p>Before the mass vaccination campaign, each person who got infected with H1N1 would pass on the virus to two or three people, thus fuelling outbreaks. But Poirier explained since more than 57 per cent of the population has been immunized, the virus's "reproduction rate" has dropped to less than one, making a third wave theoretically impossible.</p>
<p>Quebec's vaccination rate compares favourably with that of such other large provinces as Ontario, where about 45 per cent of the population was vaccinated.</p>
<p>Health Minister Yves Bolduc called the vaccination campaign a success and said it made sense to try to vaccinate all Quebecers, even though authorities knew the virus was less virulent than initially foreseen.</p>
<p>"If we had many deaths today, people would have told us that we should have done more," Bolduc said. "The most important thing is that we saved lives and prevented a third wave."</p>
<p>The Health Department yesterday released on its website a breakdown of H1N1 vaccination rates by region. The government initially refused to disclose the information, arguing it didn't want to create the wrong impression of "competition" between the regions, but yielded after The Gazette insisted the information be made public.</p>
<p>Vaccination rates in northern Quebec were the highest, ranging from 78.9 per cent to 83.7 per cent. This probably reflects the fact the government considered aboriginal groups to be a priority for vaccination.</p>
<p>The rate in Montreal was 50.2 per cent, 56.3 per cent in Laval and 58.1 per cent in the Montérégie.</p>
<p>Public health officials have already suggested Montreal's relatively low vaccination rate stems from the fact the city has many people from cultural communities who don't speak either English or French, and might not have been aware of the vaccination campaign.</p>
<p>The government is now turning its attention to providing the seasonal flu vaccine. Among those eligible for the free shots are Quebecers who are at least 60 years old, people with chronic illnesses like diabetes, the immuno-compromised and infants age 6 months to 23 months.</p>

</p>
<p>Stories Report on Business is following today :</p>
<p>Labour markets suffer setbacks</p>
<p>The world's major economies are still struggling to get people back to work.</p>
<p>The recession has now killed more than eight million U.S. jobs. American employers slashed 85,000 positions in December, a setback much worse than markets expected, as the unemployment rate held steady at 10 per cent. Still, there was one optimistic sign: Revisions to earlier readings showed that 4,000 jobs were created in November, the first growth in almost two years. "The fact that positive job creation occurred in November 2009 is a very important fact, one that should not be ignored despite the disappointing headline print in December," said TD Securities economics strategist Ian Pollick, though he noted that the stubborn duration of unemployment is a concern. Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-sheds-85000-jobs/article1423604/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/us-sheds-85000-jobs/article1423604/])</p>
<p>Canada's jobs market flat</p>
<p>Canada's labour market stalled in December, but this morning's Statistics Canada report still points to continued stability and, more importantly, possibly better times going forward. Over all, the economy shed 2,600 jobs last month, disappointing given that economists had expected an increase of up to 20,000, but this followed a gain of 79,100 jobs in November and does little to change the general picture of stabilization over the past nine months. The unemployment rate remained at 8.5 per cent, and some economists believe it will fall going forward. "While a tad disappointing, today's jobs report hardly represents a serious challenge to the recovery picture," said BMO Nesbitt Burns economist Douglas Porter. "After all, it only offsets a tiny fraction of November's hefty gain. Still, it reinforces the view that the recovery will be uneven and sluggish."</p>
<p>It's important to note, however, that while the public sector lost jobs, employment in the private sector remained unchanged. Private employers resumed hiring in November, which was key to the recovery, and there was little in today's reading to change that. Also notable is that the number of hours worked rose 1.5 per cent in December from November. That, said Scotia Capital economists Karen Cordes and Derek Holt, was the biggest in two months "as firms started to reboot, signalling that we could see a gain in employment in January. Employers are working their existing work forces more aggressively and that's a classic sign of adding bodies in future." Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadas-jobs-market-stalls/article1423514/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/canadas-jobs-market-stalls/article1423514/])</p>
<p>Unemployment rises in Europe</p>
<p>Unemployment is also on the rise in the euro zone, but the divergence among the 16 countries that use the common currency is spectacular. The overall jobless rate hit 10 per cent in November the highest since the currency union was formed in 1999, the EU's statistics agency said today. But given there are 16 nations involved, the rates range from 3.9 per cent in the Netherlands to more than 19 per cent in Spain. This puts the European Central Bank in a spot, given that it is adopting monetary policy that must cover both the haves and the have-nots, worrying about inflation in the strong economies and growth in the weaker areas. Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/euro-zone-jobless-rate-hits-10/article1423501/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/euro-zone-jobless-rate-hits-10/article1423501/])</p>
<p>German exports rise again</p>
<p>Europe's biggest economy continues to recover. Germany reported today that exports in November rose for the third month in a row while industrial production rebounded, though not in a big way. Germany's exports are key to the global recovery given that the country, until recently, was the world's top exporter, an honour now held by China. "The economic revival in emerging countries is being reflected in German foreign trade," an export official told The Associated Press. "However, the strong decline in imports shows that large parts of the economy are still running in neutral."</p>
<p>EU pushes Greece for tougher measures</p>
<p>The EU wants Greece to cut deeper. An inspection team that spent three days going over the books in Athens is pushing the country to take even stronger measures than it has proposed to fix its fiscal mess. "EU officials are asking for spending cuts as much as possible," Greece's finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, told Greek TV. "We are in the eye of the storm. A country that borrows €50- to 60-billion a year has to think of the markets." Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/greece-says-its-in-the-eye-of-the-storm/article1423584/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/greece-says-its-in-the-eye-of-the-storm/article1423584/])</p>
<p>Argentina fight heats up</p>
<p>Argentina's central bank chief is fighting to keep his job, and keep the government's hands off the bank's foreign exchange reserves. Martin Redrado, who was fired yesterday by President Cristina Fernandez, told a local television station today that he won't quit, but will instead seek court nullification of Ms. Fernandez's move. The president wants to use more than $6-billion (U.S.) to help pay rising debt costs, and ordered the central bank to turn over the funds. Mr. Redrado refused, leading to his firing.</p>
<p>India a ‘slow-moving elephant'</p>
<p>India's prime minister is promising to fix the problems facing businesses in the emerging powerhouse, from infrastructure troubles to red tape. Yesterday, Lakshmi Mittal, who heads Arcelor Mittal, the world's largest steel maker, slammed the government for its bottlenecks. Today, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh vowed to make things better. "I recognize the frustration well-wishers feel when they lament why things don't work faster or why well-formulated plans and policies don't get implemented as well as they should be," he told a conference in New Delhi. "It is probably true that we are a slow-moving elephant but it is equally true that with each step forward we leave behind a deep imprint."</p>
<p>H1N1 fears boost Jean Coutu</p>
<p>Fears over the H1N1 flu bug helped boost the fortunes of Jean Coutu Group Inc. in the latest quarter. Quebec's biggest drugstore chain this morning reported a profit of $44.6-million or 19 cents a share, a turnaround from a loss of $399.2-million or $1.66 a share a year earlier, when the company took a heft writedown related to Rite-Aid in the United States. Revenue jumped in the latest quarter to $678.1-million from $620.3-million. Jean Coutu cited market growth and a bigger network of franchised stores but also noted that "the consumers' cautiousness in view of the N1N1 flu contributed to the increase of the over-the-counter drug sales."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Guelph area health board faces deficit and job cuts</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health - made up of people who protected the public against the recent threat of a flu pandemic - faces a minimum $600,000 budget deficit and significant layoffs this year.</p>
<p>"To have to let people go after they stepped up to the plate and worked so very hard is very distressing," medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer said Thursday, fighting to maintain her composure.</p>
<p>Mercer said the health unit is struggling to do more with less. "That's the bottom line."</p>
<p>She added this comes at a time of unparalleled challenges such as the pandemic H1N1 flu threat, to which staff responded by distributing and administering almost 100,000 vaccine doses. It also comes at a time when the province is making increased demands.</p>
<p>To carry out its varied work in public health protection and promotion with fewer than 240 employees, the board of directors several weeks ago approved a 2010 budget of $16.213 million.</p>
<p>That represents an increase of 4.5 per cent over the year that ended Dec. 31, even though Queen's Park, the primary funder, isn't expected to announce funding levels until September.</p>
<p>Mercer said early indications are the provincial government will provide up to three per cent more at best.</p>
<p>Mercer said she still faces a $600,000 shortfall. She wouldn't speculate on how many jobs may have to be cut some time this year. Employees comprise 82 per cent of the operating budget and "will unfortunately need to be reduced."</p>
<p>At the board's meeting on Wednesday, director John Green said he feared considerable job losses in a worst-case scenario of only a three per cent budget increase. "They're going to be massive if we cut back to three per cent," he predicted.</p>
<p>In an interview Thursday, Mercer said "public health will continue to work hard to deliver services . . . as best we can."</p>
<p>But she said government funding for some programs hasn't kept pace with rising costs, money for other programs is being reduced and the funding level for still others has been stagnant for years.</p>
<p>"It's a fairly complex number of events that have occurred," said Mercer, the health board's chief executive.</p>
<p>Demand for its services is up. For example, public health is expected this year to inspect and regulate small-scale drinking water systems, like those in restaurants, community halls, churches, motels, sports complexes and trailer parks, even though the funding doesn't cover the cost of staff, Mercer said.</p>
<p>Public health augments government funding with some money from municipalities for services rendered. But, in a further complication, Mercer recently heard from one community, Dufferin County, which asked that her board reduce its projected budget increase to three per cent.</p>
<p>A funding shortfall would come at a particularly bad time for the health board, which still needs to find a permanent home. It's temporarily housed in available space at a trucking warehouse complex on Southgate Drive, after asbestos contamination was found in its former headquarters near Guelph's downtown.</p>
<p>"We are in desperate need of a facility," Mercer said.</p>
<p>Guelph MPP Liz Sandals was unavailable for comment Wednesday. Wellington-Halton Hills MPP Ted Arnott could not be reached on short notice. But Premier Dalton McGuinty is struggling with a large provincial deficit at the tail end of a recession.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Health unit did job well</b>
</div><div>359 words</div><div>8 January 2010</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2010 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>The Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health unit was a capable, nimble and responsive steward during the H1N1 vaccination blitz last fall.</p>
<p>The organization received criticism – including some directed by this newspaper – during the early days of its response. And, its lead officials are open to acknowledging they learned some lessons during that period. These were quickly incorporated into improved practices such that the middle and closing phases of the community clinic efforts were seemingly models of efficiency, care and effectiveness.</p>
<p>All stakeholders are grateful the flu strain seems to have proven less lethal than was initially anticipated and that community outbreaks were less intense and frequent than was forecast. But the overall successful emergence of this health-region through the arrival of H1N1 is also strongly linked to the efforts and advocacy of public health officials – local ones very definitely included.</p>
<p>Several individuals aired complaints about long waits for vaccines, queue-jumping at clinics and inconsistent messages about managing this illness. But co-ordinating a public response to an evolving disease, with new research facts and hypotheses emerging unstintingly and publicly is no simple task. Add in the period of near public hysteria surrounding obtaining vaccinations in the wake of the death of a Toronto youth to the virus, a brief national vaccine supply shortage, and the wide politicization of the flu's management and it all became more complicated to oversee.</p>
<p>Locally, the health unit amended hours of operation at flu clinics to better meet forecasted need. It engaged in vigorous communication to the public to share broad messages and narrow ones – such as wait times at clinics. Those came to be provided variously, including through social networking tools. It also partnered variously to expand its vaccination capacity.</p>
<p>In the end, it hit the marks it undertook publicly to achieve. It provided ample early access to so-called high risk group clients and enough overall vaccination access to allow for all parties interested to receive an H1N1 shot to obtain one before Christmas – as promised. In short, it offered effective public health service even under ample duress.</p>
<p>Thank you. Job well done.</p>

<p>You have to be willing to have only a few friends, Lorrie Moore said.</p>
<p>Writers, if they are honest with themselves, cannot worry about offending or how many allies they have acquired in this world. It's an obnoxious position, hard to defend. But they do not work for the Chamber of Commerce; they are not examples to the community. They are there for their story, and if it sounds harsh ...</p>
<p>Well, maybe.</p>
<p>She said this nicely.</p>
<p>We got on the subject because I mentioned she is one of those writers from whom readers take cues on how to live, and how not to.</p>
<p>"I hope not," she said.</p>
<p>Then she considered the point a moment -- a point that John Cheever and Raymond Carver and Alice Munro and the other short-story masters she is routinely lumped in with have all heard -- and she said, somewhat coyly, "I always thought people read for company."</p>
<p>Perhaps, but for 25 years, Moore has been the kind of writer who "brings that eerie quality to a story that suggests someone has eavesdropped on your thoughts," New Yorker fiction editor Deborah Treisman told me. "And that's because Lorrie gets to the heart of how people talk right now, how they fumble words, and blame, and miscommunicate. She captures the social tics that spill across speech. No one has captured that -- or how we live now -- as well. I can't see Lorrie writing historical novels."</p>
<p>That said, hers is not a brand of incisiveness without hurt or disgust, and Moore, who emerged with a new bestseller, a novel ( A Gate at the Stairs), a few months ago after a 10-year absence, and who started last year by eulogizing John Updike (who, conversely, included Moore's You're Ugly, Too in the Best American Short Stories of the Century), and who ended the year on scores of best-of-2009 lists (see story below), still comes off as funny as she is abrasive.</p>
<p>Her subjects remain everyday -- relationships, family. But her talent for showcasing everyday absurdities and pangs of regret, and the way people habitually joke instead of discuss, is less common. The Illinois history professor in You're Ugly, Too, for instance, visiting friends in New York, becomes so bored with a guy who corners her on the balcony at a Halloween party that, for a moment, she begins to push him over the balcony -- only to apologize.</p>
<p>Indeed, near the end of A Gate at the Stairs, Moore's 20-year-old protagonist, who becomes nanny to a semi-precious bohemian Wisconsin couple, decides that when talking with people about impossible subjects, "to ease the suffering of the listener, things had better be funny."</p>
<p>"I always took her to be an incredibly compassionate writer," said former Chicago theatre director Abigail Deser, who staged a series of readings based on Moore's stories at the Museum of Contemporary Art in 2004.</p>
<p>"But if her work gets under your skin, I suppose it's because people think saying good things about others is the same as compassion, and she knows the difference."</p>
<p>Moore and I sat in an upscale neighbourhood bistro -- "great moules frites," she says. It's the kind of restaurant that didn't exist in Madison when she moved here, about the time Self-Help (1985), her first collection, was published. The titles of her stories then, many written while she was in graduate school at Cornell University -- How To Be an Other Woman, How to Talk to Your Mother, How to Become a Writer ( "First, try to do something, anything, else") -- were often deeply ironic parodies of the notion that good fiction should be cathartic and instructive.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I raised, for a second time, the idea that her work was perversely instructive. She said she didn't really believe in "work that gives instruction, which would be silly. If a work is complex, there should be 10 contradictory morals, and any lessons won't be recognizable. Neither will the pieces pulled from life. You tell people they are not in a work because they aren't, if you're doing your job."</p>
<p>She teaches creative writing at the University of Wisconsin -- she's been in the English department since she was 27, when she was the youngest member of the department in its history.</p>
<p>That was 25 years ago, when she moved to Madison from upstate New York. Anyway, her students, she says, "don't feel the transgressive nature of literature yet. Especially under-grads. They worry about offending people, and that's fine. They don't want to upset people. They show their writing to their parents. To their parents! I say, 'OK, Becky, now write something you wouldn't show your parents.' Becky says, 'I couldn't!' But, see -- they're nice kids."</p>
<p>Moore slaps the bistro table lightly and takes a sip from her Belgian wheat ale.</p>
<p>Moore is 52 now.</p>
<p>She decided this would be the last stop on her book tour, meaning the last stop would take place in private, a block or so from her home, which was built 100 years ago and is tall and yellow and, on the day I arrive, bordered with a brown moat of thick dead leaves. She didn't want anyone in her home, she said apologetically. She just doesn't like journalists to see the flotsam of her life. Besides, her son had the swine flu. But also, I suspect, it's convenient for Moore, who's never been much on soliciting attention. She is not unfriendly, and, yes, she still has friends, despite three decades of short stories and novels that keenly see through the pretensions of high-minded college-town types and discombobulated urban dwellers. (The title of one of her best stories, People Like That Are the Only People Here, could be the title of half of her stories.) During a long conversation, she is not at all guarded about her personal life in Madison -- nuggets of information slip out, a divorce years ago, her teenage son's health issues.</p>
<p>But for someone who knows a certain tasteful, upper middle-class, vaguely trendy, socially conscious, politically lazy category of American intimately -- speaking to one of her editors, I kept referring to Madison as Evanston, until we decided the distinction was minor -- Moore herself has retained a modest profile.</p>
<p>"I'm not deliberately hiding up here," she replied.</p>
<p>"But I am a single mom, and my kid has swine flu, and I just came back from Denver, and I don't have the strength to write all the time, and I want that person to be separate from the work. I'm not a confessional person.</p>
<p>"My life is not very interesting anyway. I don't do anything."</p>
<p>She says this, partly, to explain why it took a decade to turn in the followup to Birds of America, her acclaimed 1998 collection.</p>
<p>"The feeling that the world is getting away from you is not a good feeling for a writer," she said.</p>
<p>She hears this from writer friends. She also said another reason it takes her longer now perhaps is that her writing is changing, partly because her relationship with Madison changed.</p>
<p>"Lorrie was complete when we first published her, the total package," said Victoria Wilson, who has edited each of Moore's books at Knopf. "But she is growing less minimalist, more heartfelt and sophisticated, than she was in the 1980s. Her voice is still there, but there's less stylishness now."</p>
<p>Recently, a collection of her complete stories was published in England.</p>
<p>Which meant Moore had to read everything she's ever written.</p>
<p>"It was a nightmare. As you read, you think it's pretty good, then you hit something so awful, you wonder if you knew the difference between good and bad writing. I guess I didn't. All I could think was how I would never write those stories now. Not at all.</p>
<p>"I don't feel like a stranger in a strange land, like I did when I first moved to the Midwest. Madison was cheap then. You couldn't find Thai food, or even a good bagel. Those were things I resented. But there's a sameness that's sweeping the country. The Midwest is losing whatever made it so foreign. The South -- same thing. I wrote a lot from that dislocation. Someone's visiting, and there's disruption. It's a classic story construction, and maybe there's just less of a reason for it now."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>D is the new C: Sunshine vitamin is suddenly hot</b>

<p>Vitamin D used to be the Rodney Dangerfield of vitamins – often overlooked and certainly neglected by consumers.</p>
<p>But these days, with the sunshine vitamin hyped for everything from reducing the risk of cancer to boosting the immune system against the flu, Canadians are becoming a nation of vitamin D-poppers. The nutrient is flying off pharmacy shelves in amounts that are astonishing players in the nutritional supplement business.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Jamieson Laboratories</span>, Canada's largest supplement maker, says its vitamin D sales eclipsed those of vitamin C for the first time ever last month, capping a year of huge growth for the product.</p>
<p>The company said its vitamin D shipments rose steadily month by month throughout last year to experience an eye-popping 300-per-cent increase in December over the same month in 2008. For the year as a whole, sales were up 24 per cent.</p>
<p>“It's just been unbelievable,” said Vic Neufeld, the company's president. He said Jamieson has never experienced a sales increase of this magnitude for a supplement that has been on the market for decades.</p>
<p>Shoppers Drug Mart spokeswoman Tammy Smitham said the store's sales of private-label vitamin D also experienced “substantial growth” last year, although she declined to reveal the percentage increase.</p>
<p>It was much the same story at Rexall. The Edmonton-based drugstore giant has seen an unprecedented spike in demand for the sunshine vitamin: It was the company's fastest growing vitamin category last year, jumping 34 per cent. Sales outpaced those of vitamin C by 28 per cent. Vitamin C, the erstwhile go-to vitamin supplement, is still seeing double-digit year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>Not only are Canadians purchasing more vitamin D pills, but increasingly they're popping the strongest doses they can get. Rexall spokeswoman Donna Araujo said sales for the company's strongest vitamin D pill, which contains a 1,000 international unit dose, grew 56 per cent in the last year.</p>
<p>Ms. Smitham of Shoppers attributed some of the rise to consumers taking vitamin D as a step to help fight the H1N1 flu, because sales of other natural products linked to influenza worries, such as echinacea, also rose.</p>
<p>But the rise in demand also comes as a flurry of research reports link low levels of vitamin D to a variety of ailments, including cancer, multiple sclerosis and diabetes.</p>
<p>Surveys of Canadians have found that at least a quarter of the population has insufficient levels of the nutrient, with 5 per cent of Canadians so deficient they risk developing bone disease. It doesn't help that residents of the Great White North have trouble getting enough of the vitamin naturally – exposing naked skin to powerful ultraviolet light – during dark fall and winter months.</p>
<p>Ms. Smitham said Shoppers has seen a seasonal spike in demand for vitamin D that reflects worries among some consumers that they're not getting enough of the sunshine vitamin in winter.</p>
<p>This coincides with research indicating people need much more daily vitamin D than Health Canada has been recommending: A study from the University of California, San Diego recommended doses as high as 2,000 international units a day – far more than the 200 to 600 governments recommend.</p>
<p>Canadians have been so eager to find out their blood levels of vitamin D that provinces are struggling to pay for a surge in demand for vitamin D tests. Last year, Ontario alone conducted more than 732,000 of the tests, which cost the province as much as $52 each when performed in private labs. Ontario's Health Ministry is reconsidering whether it's worth covering the cost of vitamin D tests for otherwise healthy individuals.</p>
<p>At the same time, harried but health-conscious Canadians are popping more vitamin supplements overall than ever before. Jamieson's Mr. Neufeld said 45 per cent of adult Canadians are taking some kind of vitamin supplement, compared with about 40 per cent a few years ago.</p>

<div>AIR TRAVEL / FLU TRANSMISSION</div>
<div>Globe Life</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Passengers in economy class have higher risk of catching H1N1</b>
</div><div>DAVE McGINN </div>

</p>
<p>There's one more reason to hate flying economy class.</p>
<p>In a new study of how the H1N1 flu virus spreads through commercial air travel, researchers have found that not only can the number of in-flight infections be predicted based on just one passenger carrying the virus, but also that people travelling in economy class are much more likely to become infected than people flying first class.</p>
<p>The study, published in the current online edition of the journal BMC Medicine, was conducted by Sally Blower, director of the Center for Biomedical Modeling at the University of California in Los Angeles, along with Bradley Wagner and Brian Coburn, postdoctoral fellows in Dr. Blower's research group.</p>
<p>“Importantly, we found that the number of infections that would occur on a flight was very dependant on which cabin the infected individual was sitting in,” Dr. Blower said in a release. “We found that many infections could occur if the infected individual was travelling in economy class, but relatively few if the individual was travelling in first class.”</p>
<p>Two things explain the greater likelihood of catching the virus in economy class, the researchers said.</p>
<p>“Primarily, it's the more crowded conditions in economy,” Dr. Coburn said. “And unfortunately, there is a very high probability – 75 per cent – that if an infected person is on board, they will be in the economy cabin.”</p>
<p>Mathematical modelling techniques enabled the researchers to predict in-flight transmission rates. A five-hour flight would likely result in two to five infections, according to the study. Five to 10 people would be infected during an 11-hour flight, while seven to 17 infections would occur during a 17-hour flight.</p>
<p>To make these predictions, researchers used the Wells-Riley equation, which is designed to predict the size of outbreaks within buildings and other enclosed environments. The equation is based on the number of individuals exposed to an infectious pathogen, the respiratory rate of the infected person, the length of exposure to the infectious droplets and the concentration of infectious viral particles over time.</p>
<p>While previous research has shown that smallpox, measles, tuberculosis, seasonal influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome can be transmitted during commercial flights, this is the first study to predict the number of H1N1 flu infections, the researchers said.</p>
<p>“Clearly it was air travel, by transporting infectious individuals from the epicentre in Mexico to other geographical locations, that significantly affected the spread of H1N1 during the outbreak last spring,” Dr. Coburn said. “However, until our study, it hadn't been determined how important in-flight transmission could be.”</p>
<p>Given the results of the study, researchers said that air-travel restrictions could be one means of controlling influenza pandemics.</p>
<p>“Our results imply that one individual travelling by plane, by infecting other travellers on the same flight, could cause multiple simultaneous outbreaks in different geographical locations rather than causing only one outbreak,” Dr. Wagner said. “For that reason, quarantining passengers who travel in economy class on long-haul flights could potentially be an important control strategy this winter.”</p>
<p>But for those people with extra money to spend, fear not.</p>
<p>“There is no point in quarantining passengers in first class,” Dr. Wagner said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu shots set for schools, work sites - Vaccination rate low in province</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>

</p>
<p>Manitoba Health will set up H1N1 vaccination clinics in core-area schools and large workplaces -- and may target the needle-shy university crowd -- as it seeks to boost the province's flu immunization rate.</p>
<p>According to a survey this week by The Canadian Press, Manitoba had one of the lowest H1N1 vaccination rates in the country, along with Ontario (38 per cent) and Alberta (35-40 per cent). The Manitoba government issued a press release Thursday saying 37 per cent of the province's residents -- 442,000 people -- had been vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Opposition Conservatives jumped on the CP report, which quoted figures supplied by the Canadian Public Health Agency, and demanded answers for Manitoba's poor performance.</p>
<p>"Obviously other provinces did a better job of getting their people vaccinated than what we saw here in Manitoba. That's troubling," said Conservative health critic Myrna Driedger.</p>
<p>She pointed out that Saskatchewan and New Brunswick, with vaccination rates of 48 per cent and 67 per cent respectively, were much quicker to launch school-based programs -- something the Manitoba Tories had advocated.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald is skeptical about the fairness of the provincial comparisons, saying some jurisdictions were reporting the amount of vaccine they had distributed, while Manitoba was counting "needles in arms."</p>
<p>She said Manitoba was also quite strict in targeting the most vulnerable groups early on in the immunization campaign. The percentage of people vaccinated in those groups is significantly higher than for the population as a whole, she said, with some northern aboriginal communities more than 90 per cent immunized.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the seemingly poor showing may have been timing, the minister said. Manitoba had its worst bout of H1N1 illness in the first wave of the disease last spring, well before a vaccine was available. By fall, when provinces like British Columbia (40 per cent vaccinated) were getting hammered, far fewer people here were getting sick. Human nature being what it is, there was less of a sense of urgency to roll up our sleeves in Manitoba.</p>
<p>"Should a vaccine have been available with what we were going through in the spring, it would have likely been a different story," Oswald said.</p>
<p>She said school vaccination clinics will be available in the Brandon Regional Health Authority and in core areas of Winnipeg where kids are less likely to be immunized by a family doctor than in suburban areas.</p>
<p>Oswald said big employers, such as the Canadian taxation centre, are signing up to host immunization clinics.</p>
<p>Manitoba is also eyeing a "social marketing campaign" aimed at university students and the 17-30 age group, which hasn't been well represented at flu-shot clinics so far. "We've had clinics at the University of Manitoba in the past, but we think that this is a group that we really need to revisit as well," the minister said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the province issued a bulletin Thursday announcing that a fourth Manitoban has died of H1N1 since the second wave of the illness began last fall. The individual was only described as an adult between ages 18 and 65 who had underlying health conditions. Seven Manitobans died in the first wave of the illness.</p>
<p>The province said 7,300 Manitobans have been immunized for H1N1 in doctors' offices since the mass flu-vaccination clinics closed in early December. So far, 160 Manitoba doctors' offices have ordered 30,000 doses of vaccine.</p>

<div>NEW DECADE / SAME OLD ANXIETY</div>
<div>Globe Life Column</div>
<div id="hd"><b>It's time to break our fear addiction</b>
</div><div>JUDITH TIMSON   </div>
<div>884 words</div><div>8 January 2010</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L1</div><div>English</div><div>2010 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>jtimson@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>It's barely the beginning of 2010 and already there are horrible new things to be afraid of. An approaching dementia epidemic! Skyrocketing interest rates! Exploding underwear! Airport screeners seeing you naked!</p>
<p>I had hoped we would make this decade at least slightly different from the last. As CBC Radio's Michael Enright recently pointed out on his show The Sunday Edition, the previous decade began with one “spasm of groundless fear and baseless hysteria” – Y2K – and ended with another – swine flu. In between, of course, there were some very real terrors: Sept. 11 and the economic meltdown.</p>
<p>But unless we take immediate action, this decade will be swamped by the Fear Factor as well.</p>
<p>Many of us contribute to it. Politicians strive to make you afraid so you'll vote for them. (While crime prevention legislation, for example, may be of value, insinuating that the crime rate is uniformly rising is often a lie.)</p>
<p>And the media – we are the ultimate sky-is-falling brigade. It's our job to connect the dots and highlight the dangers, but the ubiquitous “breaking news” from airplanes around the world if one non-terrorist passenger gets slightly unruly is designed to do nothing but get our pulses racing and keep us hooked.</p>
<p>Clearly, fear can be a drug. It's addictive to be on terror alert or economic lockdown. It sharpens the senses, and our resulting hyper-vigilance gives us a sense of busyness and purpose, which is rather pathetic.</p>
<p>The world's genuine dangers are not going to disappear so easily. So we are going to have to find better ways to handle our fear – globally and personally.</p>
<p>Personally, it could be taking a mindfulness approach: focusing on the present and not the terrifying what ifs of the future.</p>
<p>Or we could try adopting a European-style shrug of the shoulders when faced with bad news. The French, for example, seem to greet every fresh désastre with a mordant “but, of course” – as if to say, what else did you expect?</p>
<p>I've been impressed by beleaguered travellers being interviewed in airports about the often absurd new preflight security measures in the wake of the attempted Christmas Day airplane bombing.</p>
<p>From an older woman laughing and saying, “Who cares if those scanners see me naked?” to a man philosophically weighing the benefits of increased safety over longer wait times and choosing safety, most people seem both sanguine and balanced in their reaction.</p>
<p>What they are really saying is they'd rather have the inconvenience than the fear, let alone the actual danger. (Of course, there are now two fresh fears: the shocking incompetence of intelligence experts and the possibility of missing one's plane altogether. It's a never-ending loop.)</p>
<p>You may ask friends and family about what truly scares them and discover few of your fears are unique. One of my friends, who is challenged daily by an unpredictable illness, took the time to list not only what she was currently afraid of but what no longer roused her fear-o-meter. Out: nuclear holocaust. In: running out of time, being trapped by a debilitating disease, “an endless end.” And she added that classic fear of most parents: that our children won't have happy, healthy lives and enjoy the same benefits we have.</p>
<p>Another fear fighter: laughter. Comedian Jon Stewart started his first Daily Show of the new year with a segment called Terror 2.0, complete with “doomsday underpants.” I felt much better after watching it, as I did reading Andy Borowitz's blog posting suggesting that the new full body scans would also double as medical checkups.</p>
<p>To quell fear globally, we have to elect good leaders who know what to say about a crisis as well as what to do. Say what you will about U.S. President Barack Obama's mixed results in his first year in office, there is still something to admire in his calm approach to dangerous situations and his refusal to employ semantics to up the ante. He fully acknowledged both the unacceptable failures of the system in the airline incident and the frustration of travellers in the wake of more stringent security, but somehow the axis of evil has been downgraded to an axis of upheaval, which seems a more manageable threat. Though it drives his fear-addicted opponents – pining for that old shock-and-awe lingo – crazy.</p>
<p>I'm not going to insult you by exhorting you, as so many self-help books about fear do, to “live boldly” or “take a risk,” if what you're feeling is genuine fear. But it's good to remember that unless you're holed up in your house, wrapped in an angora blanket and watching Friends reruns, just being in the outside world is taking a risk.</p>
<p>Instead, I'll leave you with this: Breathe deeply, weigh what all doomsdayers are selling before you buy and consider that even if you're a frequent flier, every statistic shows you are likely to survive.</p>
<p>In which case, you better figure out what to do about those skyrocketing interest rates. Not to mention dementia.</p>
