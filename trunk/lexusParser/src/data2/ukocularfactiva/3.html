<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A breakthrough in gene therapy could improve the eyesight of hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from inherited blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A medical trial, which began last February, involved inserting genes into patient's eyes to correct a genetic fault that stops their retinas detecting light properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After treatment, the three patients involved experienced vision at least equivalent to before the operation, but one patient benefited significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Howarth, aged 18, said: "At first I could not see anything really in the eye that was operated on, but it got much better after a week, then gradually even better until it was back to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now, my sight when it's getting dark or it's badly lit is definitely better. It's a small change but it makes a big difference to me.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before the operation, I used to rush home from college when it started to get dark because I was worried about getting around.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now I can take my time and stay later at college if I need to, for band rehearsals and things like that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Known as Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), the inherited disorder causes progressive deterioration in vision and can lead to blindness in teenagers.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It occurs when faulty genes, called RPE65, stop the layer of cells at the back of the eye working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research was carried out by the University College London (UCL) Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital, who received £1 million from the Department of Health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team conducting the trial was led by Professor Robin Ali and includes eye surgeon James Bainbridge and retinal specialist Professor Tony Moore.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof Ali said: "Showing for the first time that gene therapy can work in patients with eye disease is a very significant milestone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This trial establishes proof of principle of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease and paves the way for the development of gene therapy approaches for a broad range of eye disorders."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof Moore said: "It is very encouraging to see that this treatment can work, even in young adults who have severely advanced disease."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pioneering gene therapy trial has helped a blind man to see in a breakthrough that brings hope to millions affected by eye diseases. British scientists have claimed a world first for the revolutionary treatment, which involved a single injection into the retina at the back of the eye. Steven Howarth, 18, from Bolton, who has a rare inherited eye disorder which has left him with extremely poor vision and completely unable to see in the dark, improved sufficiently after the treatment to be able to navigate a "maze" in conditions similar to street lighting at night. Experts hailed the research, supported by #1 M from the Department of Health, as a major advance in the treatment of blindness and predicted it would lead to new developments in gene therapy for other conditions. Mr Howarth is one of the first three patients to be treated with the experimental therapy by specialists at University College London (UCL) and Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"> The other two patients, aged 17 and 23, suffered no ill effects but did not report any improvement. The results are published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THIS is the London surgeon who has given a blind teenager his sight back and he has hailed the pioneering treatment as opening the way for a range of new cures.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bainbridge, consultant surgeon at Moorfields Eye Hospital, spoke after musician Stephen Howarth, from Bolton, regained his vision following ground-breaking gene therapy. The 17-year-old, who suffers from a rare form of childhood blindness, is now able to walk unaided.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers from UCL Institute of Ophthalmology worked with a surgical team at the specialist eye hospital in east London to use gene therapy to regenerate dying cells in Stephens right eye. Mr Bainbridge, who carried out the operation, said: This is only the beginning. What weve demonstrated so far is proof of principle that gene therapy can be used to treat a particular gene disorder.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Robin Ali, from the Institute of Ophthalmology, led the trial. He added: I find it difficult to remember being as excited as I am about our science and what it might achieve.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although Stephens genetic condition is rare, researchers believe their technique could treat a variety of sight disorders, possibly even age-related sight loss.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An 18-year-old man with a rare form of blindness has amazed doctors by navigating a maze after receiving gene therapy to improve his eyesight. Steven Howarth, from Bolton, was among three volunteers with childhood blindness to take part in the world's first clinical trial of the treatment, led by doctors in London.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Each of the patients inherited a condition called Leber's congenital amaurosis, which affects one in 80,000 people in Britain. The condition is caused by a faulty gene which gradually destroys the retina, leaving most patients completely blind by their late 20s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors said the technique represented a "huge advance" and gave hope to thousands of people with so far incurable forms of blindness. If the therapy is effective in other patients, it could revolutionise treatment for more than 100 inherited forms of blindness, affecting 30,000 people in Britain alone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During a two-hour operation, surgeons from University College London and Moorfields eye hospital injected a harmless virus containing a healthy copy of the RPE65 gene under each patient's retina. The virus ferries the healthy gene into nearby cells, which then begin working normally. While Howarth's vision got better after the operation, the other two patients, whose disease was more advanced, have yet to show any significant improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday, coincide with a similar trial led by Jean Bennett at the University of Pennsylvania. All three patients in her trial showed modest improvements in eyesight after receiving the gene injections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This really paves the way for developing a treatment for people who have so far had no prospect of a cure," said Robin Ali, an ophthalmologist at UCL, who is lead ing the British team. "If everything goes well, it's possible that within two to three years it might be approved for use in the clinic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patients' condition particularly affects their peripheral and night-time vision. In a test before and after treatment, Howarth was asked to walk through a "maze" which recreated a dimly lit street.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The first time he tried, he was constantly bumping into things and was disoriented but eventually managed to go through the maze. But six months after treatment, he walked straight through as fast as a normal person," said Ali.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tests showed Howarth was now able to see in lighting conditions 100 times dimmer than before.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BREAKTHROUGH gene therapy could improve the eyesight of hundreds of thousands of people who suffer from inherited blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A medical trial which began last February involved inserting genes into patient's eyes to correct a genetic fault that stops their retinas detecting light properly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After treatment, the three patients involved experienced vision at least equivalent to before the operation, but one patient benefited significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Howarth, 18, said: "Before the operation I was nervous and excited at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Afterwards, my eyes felt uncomfortable, like sandpaper, but this stopped in a day or so.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News | COMMENT</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The compelling simplicity of gene therapy attracts great attention, with interest swinging between enthusiastic optimism when there is dramatic progress and scathing criticism when things go badly. Calling it "gene therapy" does imply the approach will work (it's written on the tin), but it has been a long and difficult road towards success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University College London/Moorfields study is a welcome step forward. It highlights the principle that gene therapy can be used to improve vision in some patients with Leber's congenital amaurosis, giving hope where there was none before. Hope is contagious and many people with incurable genetic diseases will be interested in these findings, hoping that gene therapy treatments may soon be found for them. Gene therapy can work, but only when the healthy "transgenes" can be introduced efficiently into diseased cells. The biggest step in turning principle into practice occurred when scientists appreciated the need to prioritise efficient "transgene delivery". In the case of the Moorfields study, the transgenes are delivered using a vector - a harmless virus that "infects" the diseased cells - injected directly under the retina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar effects have been seen once before, at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in the treatment of children with severe combined immune deficiency (SCID); the "bubble boys". There, vectors were administered to bone marrow stem cells isolated from patients, and then reintroduced so that they can repopulate the patients' immune systems with healthy cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In all cases, it's about efficient transgene delivery, and we anticipate continued success in other areas where diseased target cells can be accessed directly - for example by injection in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, or by treatment of stem cells in other immune disorders.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although animal research is essential for most forms of medicine, clinical trials are particularly important to assess strengths and weaknesses of complex approaches like gene therapy. For example, the toxicities seen in four patients with SCID (where the transgene became inserted into the patients' chromosomal DNA and caused leukaemia) were not anticipated from preclinical studies. Only because some patients were enrolled in experimental trials have we now learnt the importance of making safer vectors for SCID, and future trials will be conducted using these new vectors. SCID is a life-threatening disease, and for patients without bone marrow donors, gene therapy now provides a remarkable, potentially curative, way forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Applying gene therapy to diseases where target cells are spread around the body, for example in cancer, requires development of more sophisticated vectors that can be injected into the patients' bloodstreams and can seek out and deliver therapeutic transgenes selectively to the target diseased cells. That is the area where much of gene therapy research is now focused, and progress in delivery will undoubtedly lead to even more exciting breakthroughs, including in the treatment of some of the major killers of our time - cancer and heart disease.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeremy Laurance Health Editor   </div><div>946 words</div><div>28 April 2008</div><div>The Independent</div><div>IND</div><div>1ST</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2008 Independent & Media PLC   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">News</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A pioneering gene therapy trial has helped a blind man to see in a breakthrough that brings hope to millions affected by eye diseases. British scientists have claimed a world first for the revolutionary treatment, which involved a single injection into the retina at the back of the eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steven Howarth, 18, from Bolton, who has a rare inherited eye disorder which has left him with extremely poor vision and completely unable to see in the dark, improved sufficiently after the treatment to be able to navigate a "maze" in conditions similar to street lighting at night.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts hailed the research, supported by £1m from the Department of Health, as a major advance in the treatment of blindness and predicted it would lead to new developments in gene therapy for other conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dawn Primarolo, the Public Health minister, said: "This is a major achievement for British science and the NHS and shows we truly are at the forefront of innovation."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The injection was given into the back of Mr Howarth's worse- affected eye, which had almost no vision, especially in low light. A video of him with his "good" eye covered, taken before the treatment was carried out, shows him trying to find his way through a maze of three doorways and repeatedly bumping into walls and losing his sense of direction. Six months after receiving the injection, a repeat video shows an astonishing improvement. He can be seen negotiating a similar maze in low light in seconds, without mishap.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Howarth is one of the first three patients to be treated with the experimental therapy by specialists at University College London (UCL) and Moorfields Eye Hospital. The other two patients, aged 17 and 23, suffered no ill effects but did not report any improvement. The results are published today in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Results of a similar trial by a rival US group at the University of Pennsylvania, which began eight months after the British trial, are also reported in the journal today. Three patients, one aged 19 and two aged 26, were injected and are reported to have improved vision as measured by standard eye tests. One showed an improved ability to navigate an obstacle course. However, one of the American patients developed a hole in the retina, thought to be due to the surgery, though this did not affect their sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin Ali, professor of human molecular genetics at UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, who led the British study, said: "We are thrilled. We started with the most difficult cases - with late-stage disease, using a low dose and in the worst affected eye - because we were being cautious. As we move to younger patients with an increased dose we expect better results."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique has already been shown to work in animals where results were better in those with less-advanced disease, he said. It is now being tried in nine younger patients, aged eight to 16, and the researchers hope for improved results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is too early to say anything but we anticipate further success," Professor Ali said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Howarth, a student and a guitarist, said he had been nervous and excited before the treatment. He said his eye "felt like sandpaper" after, and took over a week to return to normal.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now, when it's getting dark or it's badly lit, my sight is definitely better. It's a small change - but it makes a big difference to me. Before the operation, I used to rush home from college when it started to get dark because I was worried about getting around. Now I can take my time and stay later if I need to, for band rehearsals and things like that."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Howarth and the two other patients were born with Leber's congenital amaurosis, an inherited degenerative disorder which leads to progressive loss of sight caused by a fault in a single gene, RPE65. The operation, carried out by James Bainbridge, a consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields Eye Hospital, involved injecting normal versions of the defective gene into the back of the eye, beneath the retina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Extreme surgical precision was required to inject the solution containing the normal genes, gently lifting the retina and causing a temporary detachment. One slip could have torn the retina and destroyed the patient's remaining sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ali said the treatment had not merely halted the degeneration but had improved vision. "This is a very significant milestone. This trial establishes proof of principle of gene therapy for inherited retinal disease and paves the way for development of gene therapy approaches in a broad range of eye disorders," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is only the second time gene therapy has been proved successful in humans, after trials showed it was effective in the rare inherited disorder called SCID (severe combined immune deficiency) which leaves babies without a functioning immune system so they have to live in a bubble to protect them from infection. This advance could open the way to treatment in other conditions, including blood and immune disorders, Professor Ali said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Len Seymour, professor of gene therapies at Oxford University and president of the British Society for Gene Therapy, said: "Carefully designed studies such as this demonstrate the remarkable power of gene therapy to correct the basis of many diseases. The encouragement this study will bring to patients and scientists alike should give increased confidence in applying similar approaches for treatment of a host of debilitating disorders, unleashing the prospect of major advances through genetic medicine."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Comment | LEADING ARTICLE ++ GENE THERAPY</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialists at Moorfields Eye Hospital might not have staged a repeat of the biblical miracle of giving sight to the blind, but in medical terms what they have accomplished is almost as exciting.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leber's congenital amaurosis leads to progressive loss of sight. It is caused by a single fault in a single gene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, by injecting a solution containing the normal gene into the retina at the back of a sufferer's eye, researchers from Moorfields have managed to improve the patient's sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successful result, the details of which are published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, will give hope to millions affected by eye diseases around the world. Inherited retinal degeneration affects one in 3,000 of the world's population.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the scientists were being cautious, this experiment deliberately used a low dose and was tested on a patient suffering from a late stage of Leber's disease. Robin Ali, professor of human molecular genetics at the University College London's Institute of Ophthalmology, argues that "as we move to younger patients with an increased dose, we expect better results".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this research has wider implications. It establishes more "proof of principle" for gene therapy. It suggests that inserting functioning genes into a patient's body can work in alleviating suffering.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This could open the door to treatment in several other conditions, including blood and immune disorders. Medical science does not work miracles, but who would deny that it can create hope where there was none before?</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A BLIND teenager has started to regain his vision after ground-breaking surgery by doctors at Moorfields Eye Hospital.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Budding musician Stephen Howarth, who suffers from a rare form of childhood blindness, is now able to walk alone at home and outside. Researchers from UCL Institute of Ophthalmology worked with a surgical team at the specialist eye hospital in east London to use gene therapy to regenerate dying cells in the 17-year-old's right eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the pioneering technique, healthy copies of a faulty gene were injected into the student's eye to enable him to detect light and to prevent the cells degenerating further and leading to complete sight loss.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the procedure, he was barely able to see at night but is now able to move around without bumping into objects and frequently walks home late at night from his local railway station in Bolton. He is the third person to have undergone the operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Evening Standard reported last May on the first patient, Robert Johnson, 23, to receive the treatment. Although the gene therapy did not improve Mr Johnson or the second patient's vision, it may well have stopped their eyesight from declining.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STEVEN HOWARTH used to dread the onset of nightfall when he would have to sprint home from college because he feared his eyesight would let him down.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With no night vision or peripheral vision, the 18-year-old aspiring guitarist would forgo playing in his band and staying out with friends.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But his life has been transformed after pioneering gene treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Before the operation I used to rush home from college when it started to get dark because I was worried about getting around,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now I can take my time and stay later at college if I need to, for band rehearsals and things like that.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His father, Tommy, said the change was "incredible''.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's doing things now that he just couldn't do before,'' he said. "It's completely transformed the life he leads.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The teenager, of Westhoughton, near Bolton, said his eyes felt like sandpaper after the operation and he could not see anything.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But it got much better after a week,'' he said. "Now my sight is definitely better when it's getting dark. It's a small change, but it makes a big difference to me.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Howarth suffers from a genetic disease called Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), which can lead to complete blindness in a patient in their 20s or 30s and affects one in 100,000 babies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is caused by abnormalities in a gene (RPE65) which prevents the normal function of the retina, the layer of cells at the back of the eyes that detect light.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A virus carrying healthy copies of the gene was injected into the cells of the retina to help it function properly. Surgeons detached Mr Howarth's retina and injected the virus, which is manufactured by the American company <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics</span>, Seattle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Side effects include retinal tears, retinal detachment and inflammation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of the three adults who have taken part in the British trial, which began in February last year, all made a full recovery after surgery with no serious side effects emerging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, Mr Howarth's treatment appears to be the most successful so far.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British researchers believe that the operation has been so helpful to the young student because his disease had not progressed to the same extent as the others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Animal studies suggest that the younger the patient and less degenerated the retina, the better the outcome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other two patients may also still benefit from the new treatment in the future, but it will be some time before this becomes apparent. One patient for whom the treatment did not work is Robert Johnson, a civil servant. Despite this, the 23-year-old is enthusiastic about the treatment's potential for others.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"For the team, I am thrilled that their hard work and dedication has paid off, with promising results in one patient allowing them to continue with this important trial,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To think that this first step could lead to treatments for other eye conditions, with the potential to help many thousands of people, is quite humbling.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Aside from any effect on me personally, I am pleased that my operation proved the safety of this technique and has enabled the team to move forward to give others that priceless chance of stabilised, or even improved, sight.''</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HUNDREDS of thousands of people with failing eyesight have been given fresh hope of a cure after gene therapy techniques were used to treat a teenager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment transformed the life of a severely visually impaired 18-year-old man. Healthy genes were injected into one eye, leading to a significant improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique could be ready for use within two years to treat people suffering from some inherited diseases of the retina, which affect 20,000 people in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within five years it could be ready for testing on people who suffer age related macular degeneration, a condition that affects 500,000 Britons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the trial carried out by a team at the University College of London Institute of Ophthalmology and Moorfields Eye Hospital, the world's first gene transplant for blindness produced an unprecedented improvement in Steven Howarth's sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The student suffered from a genetic mutation, called Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), which usually begins affecting the sight of sufferers in early childhood and eventually causes total blindness during a patient's twenties or thirties.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, there is no treatment for the condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born with no peripheral or night vision, he noticed a marked improvement after the two-hour operation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Now, my sight when it's getting dark or it's badly lit is definitely better,'' he says. "It's a small change - but it makes a big difference.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof Robin Ali, the head of the team, said the evidence of his improvement was "compelling''.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctors injected genes only into Mr Howarth's worst affected eye and used the lowest dose in what was strictly a safety trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is more than we could have expected at this stage,'' said Prof Ali, who has been racing to perform the transplants against a rival team at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, where three young adults have also been successfully treated.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment, described in the New England Journal of Medicine, should be available for other patients with this rare condition in two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Prof Ali believes that this is a proof of principle for treating a vast range of blinding conditions, from 100 other inherited kinds to the most common of all, age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a major boost for the whole field,'' he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first trials to use gene therapy to treat macular degeneration could start in three to five years, said Prof Ali.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blindness trial was partly funded by pounds 1 million from the Department of Health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The public health minister, Dawn Primarolo, said: "This is a major achievement for British science and the</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NHS.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, a leading British gene therapist said the level of Government support was inadequate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is good stuff and we have the potential to broaden these technologies to many other areas,'' he told The Daily Telegraph.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But this needs major investment from the Department of Health.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Success with three more patients was reported in the same journal by a second team - The University of Pennsylvania, The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the Second University of Naples and the Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, both in Italy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Albert Maguire led the study with his wife, Prof Jean Bennett, and the gene therapist Prof Katherine High.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Speaking to The Daily Telegraph, Profs High and Bennett conceded that Prof Ali was the first to perform the treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our own study was facilitated by the safety data that he generated when his first subject was injected.''</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than a third of a million people in the UK are registered blind or partially sighted and, overall, the RNIB estimates two million people have significant sight loss.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British doctors pioneer bionic eye that will restore sight for millions</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRITISH doctors have carried out pioneering surgery to restore the eyesight of two blind patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the revolutionary procedure, they have given the men - both Britons - a "bionic eye" which enables them to see their families for the first time in years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are now real hopes that the breakthrough will pave the way for the treatment to become available for millions around the world within a few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The "bionic eye" works by relaying images from a tiny camera mounted on a pair of sunglasses to a receiver implanted in the back of the patient's own eye.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patient is then able to see shapes of light and dark in front of them and also spots of light. It may sound basic, but to someone who has been blind for years it is nothing less than life-changing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operations were carried out at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London as part of the first clinical trial of the device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is one of only three centres in Europe involved in developing the technology. Lyndon da Cruz, the consultant retinal surgeon who performed the operations, said: "It is very special to be part of a programme developing a totally new type of treatment for patients who would otherwise have no chance of visual improvement."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two patients, believed to be in their 50s, have a rare condition known as retinitis pigmentosa.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is inherited and leads to impairment of the rods and cones in the eye which are needed to see.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although patients lose the ability to detect light, the nerves which carry this signal to the brain remain intact.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therefore, using a camera image to transmit the image to these nerves can help.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial is only testing the device on a small number of patients with the condition.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it is hoped that one day it may also be useful for patients with more common conditions such as agerelated macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If trials continue to be successful, then Second Sight, the US company which makes the device, could put it on the market in the next few years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually, the firm hopes to be able to make the camera so small it can be implanted into the eyeball.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients wear a pair of normal sunglasses with a miniature camera mounted on the centre of the righthand lens. This films the image ahead of the patient and beams it to a video processor on the patient's belt. After unscrambling the information, the video processor sends it back to the sunglasses where a tiny transmitter is also situated.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The information then passes from this device through electrodes wired into nerves in the patient's eye. From here, the message passes along the patient's optic nerve to the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Head, chief executive of the British Retinitis Pigmentosa Society, said: "These are significant advances.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In conjunction with the advances being made in stem cell therapy and gene therapy, these make for really exciting times as we work to translate science into treatment.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor John Marshall, of St Thomas' Hospital, London, and chairman of the BRPS medical advisory board, also welcomed the breakthrough but warned that it was still "very early days".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: "It is very, very good news that devices have been developed. It is very good news that in experimental trials some individuals have had these inserted.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By Jenny Hope</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TWO blind men who thought they would never see their families again have had vision restored by Britain's first 'bionic' eye operations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Electronic receivers were implanted which take signals from a camera mounted in a pair of glasses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technology allows enough vision to find doorways, follow individuals, locate objects across the room and help with eating. It gives new hope to sufferers of diseases affecting the retina for which there is no cure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surgeons at Moorfields Eye Hospital in central London implanted the artificial retinal devices as part of a Europeanwide clinical trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The identity of the two patients, thought to be in their 50s, is being kept secret.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial aims to assist those with retinitis pigmentosa, a group of genetic eye diseases affecting the retina which cause progressive loss of vision over decades.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The camera and transmitter in the glasses send a wireless signal to the ultra-thin electronic receiver and electrode panel which are attached to the retina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The electrodes stimulate the remaining retinal nerves, allowing a signal to be passed along the optic nerve to the brain. In the brain, patterns of light and dark spots are perceived which give a basic level of vision to the patient, who is able to be more mobile and independent as a result.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A wireless microprocessor and battery pack worn on the belt powers the entire device.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">American Linda Moorfoot was totally blind for more than a decade before becoming one of the first patients to test the new technology. She told Sky News: 'When I go to the grandkids' hockey game or soccer game I can see which direction the game is moving in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'I can shoot baskets with my grandson and I can watch my granddaughter dancing across the stage. I can see Ö things! It's wonderful.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The British operations were carried out last week by consultant retinal surgeon Lyndon da Cruz and his team at Moorfields, under the supervision of American colleagues who developed the device with the company Second Sight in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr da Cruz said: 'Moorfields is proud to have been one of only three sites in Europe chosen to be part of evolving this exciting new technology. The devices were implanted successfully in both patients and they are recovering well from the operations.'</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The U.S. developers are now trying to shrink the camera so it will be small enough to be implanted into an eyeball. They predict these pea-sized video cameras could be ready to be used in surgery in three to five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">David Head, chief executive of the British Retinitis Pigmentosa Society, said: 'These are significant advances and in conjunction with the advances being made in stem- cell therapy and gene therapy, make for really exciting times as we work to translate science into treatment.'</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A blind man is to steer a hovercraft across the Solent in a bid to prevent others from losing their sight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Charity worker Colin McArthur will be at the helm of Hovertravel's 130-seater Solent Express as it heads from Southsea to Ryde.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be an experience of a lifetime for the 56-year-old as he looks to raise awareness and funds for further research into the condition retinitis pigmentosa.   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RESEARCHERS in Yorkshire have taken an "important step" forward in the hunt for a cure for blindness by discovering a gene which is linked to the condition.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When mutated the gene, essential to the eye cells that "see" light, causes Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), one of the most common forms of inherited blindness in babies.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was found by scientists at the Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and Leeds University, working with experts from across the world.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Discovery of LCA5 - the 13th gene linked to LCA - comes at a time of hope for people born with the disorder.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists recently announced the start of clinical trials of a gene therapy aimed at restoring the sight of patients with LCA. The therapy involves injecting genes into the patient's eye.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Chris Inglehearn, of Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine at St James's Hospital, said: "We already know of a dozen genes which, when mutated, cause LCA. This new gene is the 13th... We can consider this a 'lucky 13th'."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research project was funded by Yorkshire Eye Research (YER) and the Wellcome Trust.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bruce Noble, of YER, said: "This new result is another important step in the right direction."   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RESEARCHERS in Leeds have found a gene which can cause childhood blindness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists from Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust and the University of Leeds, with experts worldwide, identified the gene.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the thirteenth linked to Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), a genetic disorder and one of the most common forms of inherited blindness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It occurs when a baby is carrying two copies of the mutated gene LCA5 - one from each parent - which causes defects in the retina. The gene is essential for eye cells that detect light and is involved in producing Lebercilin, which is found in cilia - finger-like projections from the surface of cells capable of moving molecules around.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now experts are hoping its discovery can in future help identify and advise families at risk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Chris Inglehearn from Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine at St James's Hospital, said: "We already know of a dozen genes which, when mutated, cause LCA. This new gene is the thirteenth and adds a substantial new piece to a growing body of evidence that defects of the cilia are a major cause of inherited blindness. We can consider this a 'lucky thirteenth' as we are building a much clearer picture of what causes the disorder."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery comes as clinical trials of gene therapy, where patients with LCA will have genes injected into their eyes to restore their sight, are to start.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Inglehearn, who has been working closely with Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust consultant ophthalmologist Martin McKibbin, added that these findings along with the clinical trials, "hold great promise".   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRITISH scientists will be able to cure all major causes of blindness within 20 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The startling prediction comes from Professor Peter Coffey, a world-renowned eye specialist.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: "In the 20th century most medicines were developed to try to stabilise eye problems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now we have reached a new era where we can cure and regenerate. I believe we will be able to reverse most causes of blindness within the next 20 years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof Coffey and his team from the Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London - which recently launched a joint project to cure one leading cause of sight loss with London's Moorfields Eye Hospital - are testing a cure for age-related macular degeneration which occurs in one in four people over 65 and leads to blindness in 10 per cent of cases.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although there are two forms of the disease - wet and dry - drugs have only been developed to treat the wet form, which accounts for around 10 per cent of cases.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof Coffey and Moorfields researchers are pioneering trials using stem cells which would cure both forms.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Lyndon Da Cruz, consultant ophthalmic surgeon at Moorfields, is carrying out the work using cells from the patients' own eyes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the help of a £4million donation, the team is planning to perform the same operation using retinal cells grown from stem cells in the lab.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hoped the first patients would be treated with this technique within five years. "This is a major breakthrough for a large unmet clinical need for which there is often no alternative therapy, " said Prof Coffey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He believes there also will be a cure for another major cause of vision loss, diabetic retinopathy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This has been linked with high blood pressure and obesity and is the largest cause of blindness in the working population - caused by changes in the blood vessels of the retina.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New treatments using a combination of stem cells, gene therapy - in which "normal" genes are injected into the eye to "switch off" faulty genes, and drugs will be able to halt and even reverse this process, said Professor Coffey.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cure for a third leading cause of blindness, glaucoma, is also likely to be available in the next two decades. Currently, there is no cure for this disease which is caused by damage to the optic nerve.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts still do not fully understand the cause of glaucoma that can strike at any age and affects more than half a million people in the UK.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Coffey said: "All the treatments and new technologies are being pioneered at Moorfields for clinical use."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Royal National Institute for the Blind welcomed the developments but said cash restrictions meant there are tens of thousands of people being denied sight-saving treatments that are available now.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even those doctors who can get drugs, such as Lucentis and Macugen, are only able to obtain them in certain circumstances.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only around one in five of the 19,000 patients who may benefit are getting the treatment - leaving around 15,000 unable to get them because of where they live.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Steve Winyard, of the RNIB said: "With the NHS now half a billion pounds in surplus it is vital some of this money is diverted to saving people's sight. It is unacceptable that on a daily basis people are forced to find the money themselves for treatment or go blind because the NHS refuses to pay."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cure for blindness is the breakthrough every scientist working in the field of opthalmology dreams about. Now, a team of gene therapy researchers at Moorfields Hospital may be on the brink. By Jeremy Laurance   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialists at University College London and Moorfields Eye Hospital are   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">testing the revolutionary treatment on 12 patients, who are aged between   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">eight and their mid-20s, and have an inherited eye disorder.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique has already been shown to work in animals affected by the same   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">disorder, called inherited retinal degeneration, and their sight was   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">restored after treatment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If proved successful in humans, the scientists hope the technique can be   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">extended to other forms of eye disease that affect hundreds of thousands of   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">people in Britain and millions around the world. Professor Robin Ali, who is   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">leading the research, said it was very exciting and represented a huge   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">step towards establishing gene therapy for the treatment of many different   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">eye conditions.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the professor warned that the work was at an early stage aimed at   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">establishing the safety and efficacy of gene transfer to the eye, and that   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">gene therapy for many common conditions including macular degeneration,   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">which affects about 500,000 mainly elderly people in Britain, was many years   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">away.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ali, the head of the division of molecular therapy at UCL's   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Institute of Ophthalmology said: If we can establish the technique of   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">delivering genes to the retina, it paves the way for applying it to other   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">inherited disorders for which there is currently no treatment. Then in the   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">longer term that could open the way to the treatment of common conditions   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">such as macular degeneration, for which there are treatments but which   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">aren't particularly good.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The advantage of using gene therapy over drugs is that you can give it as a   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">single treatment to the back of the eye, avoiding the need for repeated use   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">of drugs. We anticipate the gene transfer is life long.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Johnson, 23, one of the 12 patients in the trial, was born with an   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">inherited disorder called Leber's congenital amaurosis, which has caused his   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">sight to deteriorate progressively.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Johsnon is able to see outlines of objects in daylight but very little   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">after dark and he has been told that his sight will worsen as he ages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of his operation a few weeks ago, he told the BBC his mood was   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">swinging from extreme nervousness to a bit of excitement. It will be   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">months before he experiences any benefits from the treatment and only then   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">will the researchers be able to declare it a success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Johnson's disorder is caused by a fault in a single gene called RPE65.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation involved injecting normal versions of the defective gene into   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the pigment cells at the back of the eye. The gene is carried by a virus -   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">modified to render it harmless - which inserts it into the cells' DNA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The procedure had never been attempted before and was the riskiest part of   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the treatment, requiring extreme surgical precision. In order to deliver the   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">gene to as many cells as possible, a large volume of solution was injected   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">sufficient to lift the retina causing a temporary detachment. The retina is   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">delicate and one slip could have torn it, destroying Mr Johnson's remaining   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">sight. Mr Johnson was monitored to ensure his retina reattached within 24   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">hours.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bainbridge, a consultant ophthalmologist at Moorfields who carried out   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">the operation on Mr Johnson, said he was pleased with the outcome of the   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">surgery but there was no guarantee it would be a success. It is very   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">encouraging that we can deliver genes to an extremely fragile site in the   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">eye without complications. But we don't know for sure how someone like   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert's retina will behave in this situation, said Dr Bainbridge. The   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">research team has been experimenting with gene therapy for 15 years but this   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">is the first trial in humans. Dogs affected by the disorder who were treated   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">with the technique had their vision improved to the point where they could   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">walk through a maze without difficulty, which they had previously been   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">unable to do.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As inherited retinal degeneration is a progressive disorder, the best   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">results are likely to be seen in the youngest patients, whose sight has   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">deteriorated least. Professor Tony Moore, a retinal specialist at UCL and   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">part of the research team, said: Some indications of the results of the   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">trial may be available within several months. It will be many months before   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">we have the full picture.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the trial was welcomed by specialists in genetics.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Leonard Seymour, the president of the British Society for Gene   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therapy, said: The retina is a really good place for gene therapy because   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">it can be accessed by direct injection - overcoming the problem of gene   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">delivery. When gene delivery is efficient, the whole power of gene therapy   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">is unleashed. The diseased cells in the retina are well documented - there   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">is a good chance of success here.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research is supported with 1m from the Department of Health. Lord Hunt,   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's first clinical trial of gene therapy to treat incipient blindness has started at Moorfields Hospital in London. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Johnson, 23, is the first of 12 young adults who will have retinal genes injected into their eyes in an attempt to reverse the progressive loss of sight associated with a condition known as "inherited childhood blindness". </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial, funded by a Pounds 1m grant from the Department of Health, follows 15 years of preparatory research at Moorfields and University College London. It targets a defect in the RPE65 gene, which prevents light-detecting cells in the retina from working properly. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Moorfields team uses a "vector" - a harmless virus called AAV - to carry normal RPE65 genes into the patient's retinal cells. The AAV vector technology comes from Targeted Genetics, a US biotechnology company based in Seattle. The genetically modified virus is injected into the back of the eye. Robin Ali, the project leader, said it "represents a huge step towards establishing gene therapy for the treatment of many different eye conditions". </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bainbridge, who leads the surgical team, added: "It is very encouraging that we can deliver genes to an extremely fragile site in the eye without complications. It will be many months before we know the outcome of the procedure but we expect the best outcome in younger patients." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altogether there have been 112 gene therapy trials in the UK since 1993, involving 1,260 patients. More than 70 per cent of them have been to treat cancer. But no gene therapy products have yet moved beyond clinical trials on to the market. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Independent experts welcomed the Moorfields trial. "The retina is a really good place for gene therapy because it can be accessed by direct injection," said Leonard Seymour, professor of genetic therapies at Ox-ford University. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The retina is also good because it is relatively immune-privileged .  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breakthrough to repair damaged cells could help millions of sufferers worldwide.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surgeons injected genetic material into an eye of patient Robert Johnson - going blind through an inherited sight disorder.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert, who had a general anaesthetic, was recovering last night.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His eye has not rejected the gene therapy, but he must wait at least six months before discovering if the op was a success.   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British scientists are to launch the world's first clinical trials of a controversial gene therapy to cure childhood blindness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers will test the treatment on volunteers with a rare inherited form of blindness, in which a single defective gene causes the retina to degenerate and eventually stop working as the child grows up.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condition, called Leber's congenital amaurosis, affects one in 80,000 in Britain. Children born with the defective gene are often completely blind by their 20s. If the trials are a success, it could revolutionise the treatment of more than 100 inherited forms of blindness that affect up to 30,000 people in Britain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients taking part in the trial will be injected with a virus modified to carry a correct version of the faulty gene.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once inside the eye, the virus ferries the healthy gene into the cells that make up the retina, halting and even reversing the damage caused.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The phase 1 trials are designed to assess the safety and efficacy of the treatment in 12 patients and will be carried out by the Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London and nearby Moorfields Eye Hospital. The safety of the treatment will be under particular scrutiny, following a gene therapy trial four years ago in which two children being treated for a rare immune disorder called Scid (severe combined immunodeficiency) developed leukaemia. Their cancers arose when a virus used to deliver healthy genes accidentally led to tumour-promoting genes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trials of the latest gene therapy in dogs have proved the treatment can improve and preserve vision enough for nearly blind animals to negotiate mazes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If this trial is successful it paves the way for the application of this technology in the treatment of many forms of inherited retinal degeneration and perhaps some of the more common disorders of the eye too," said Robin Ali, an ophthalmologist at UCL, who is leading the team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers will know whether the treatment has worked in a few months.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will be many months before we have the full picture. We anticipate the best outcome in younger patients, as we will be treating the disease in the early stages of its development," said Tony Moore, a leading retinal specialist on the team.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alastair Kent, director of the Genetic Interest Group, a national alliance of more than 120 charities that support children, families and individuals affected by genetic disorders, said: "To hear of such quick progress in a gene therapy treatment is fantastic. We hope this success will lead to more funding of gene therapy research into rare conditions that currently have no cure or treatment."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew George, an immunologist at Imperial College London, said: "There is hope that once gene therapy is developed in the eye, scientists could move on to more complex organs."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Twelve people take part in trial   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* New technique has worked on dogs   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A British hospital has made the world's first attempt to treat blindness with a revolutionary gene therapy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surgeons at the Moorfields Eye Hospital in London operated on Robert Johnson, who was born with a rare sight disorder known as Leber's congenital amaurosis (LCA), which deteriorates with age.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Johnson, 23, who had genes inserted into one eye, could see only outlines during the day and very little at night before having the procedure yesterday. He is one of a dozen young patients selected for the first clinical trial to test the new therapy, which has already proved successful at restoring the sight of dogs in tests.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It will be months before the researchers know whether their work has been a success, but it is thought that the therapy could be used to treat a wide range of inherited sight disorders in adults and children.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LCA disorder is caused by a defect in a gene called RPE65, which prevents the light-sensitive layer of cells in the retina at the back of the eye from working properly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Usually these are cells that detect light, but in Mr Johnson's case they are damaged and prevent him from seeing properly.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation, conceived by researchers from University College London, involved injecting working copies of the defective gene into the back of the eye. Surgeons used a harmless virus or "vector" to carry the gene into the cells.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is hoped that the replacement genes will enable the retina to detect light - and eventually restore Mr Johnson's sight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial, funded by the Department of Health, involves 12 adults and children with LCA, for which there are currently no effective treatments.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During preliminary studies, the vision of dogs with the defect was restored to the extent that they were able to walk through a maze without difficulty; something they could not do before the treatment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The purpose of the Moorfields trial is to find out how safe and effective the intervention is for humans.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers hope that their work could lead to ways to treat more common sight problems, such as age-related macular degeneration, which affects about 250,000 Britons.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most previous gene therapies have been developed in an attempt to treat different types of cancer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before surgery, Mr Johnson told the BBC that he had mixed feelings.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: "It's very difficult to say how I'm feeling. I keep ranging from extreme nervousness to a bit of excitement."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Robin Ali, the lead researcher, based at the Institute of Ophthalmology, has spent 15 years working with colleagues developing the technique. He said yesterday: "I can't help feeling somewhat apprehensive. There is so much riding on it and we have all been waiting for a very long time."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His colleague, James Bainbridge, who carried out the surgery, said that there was no guarantee that it would be a success. However, he added: "It is very encouraging that we can deliver genes to an extremely fragile site in the eye without complications."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surgery required incredible precision. Robert Maclaren, the assistant surgeon, said yesterday that he was pleased with how things went. "We couldn't have asked for a better result," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ali added: "There are many forms of retinal degeneration, meaning the use of gene therapy treatments must be individually developed, then tested in a separate clinical trial specifically for that disease.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, the results from this first human trial are likely to provide an important basis for many more gene therapy protocols in the future."   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE WORLD'S first attempt to treat blindness by transplanting genes into the eye has started in London.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team at Moorfields Eye Hospital has begun the pioneering attempt to treat a sight disorder using gene therapy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yesterday they disclosed they had carried out genetic surgery a few weeks ago on Robert Johnson, a civil servant based in London who was born with a sight disorder which deteriorates with age.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Johnson, who had genes inserted into just one eye, can see outlines during the day, but little at night.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, it will be months before the researchers know whether the cutting-edge technique has worked.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this gene therapy is successful scientists believe that the technology could be adapted to treat a range of sight disorders, such as age-related macular degeneration, one of the most common causes of blindness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial, which has received funding from the Department of Health, involves a dozen adults and children who have a condition called Leber's congenital amaurosis which affects one in 100,000 babies. Sight deteriorates to such a degree that many sufferers go blind as adults. The culprit is a gene called RPE65, which stops the retina, the layer of cells at the back of the eye that detect light, from working.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The operation, which took three hours, required great precision as Mr Johnson's retina was detached to allow the virus to infect the cells.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Maclaren, the assistant surgeon, said he was pleased with how the procedure went.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique has been successful in the lab and on animals. Dogs that had the defect had their sight improved so much that they could walk through a maze alone.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof Leonard Seymour, president of the British Society for Gene Therapy, said: "These early trials are really aiming to slow down deterioration of vision.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "It is only by performing clinical studies such as these that we can identify what we need to do to correct the problem altogether.''   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof Martin Gore, chairman of the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, which approved the procedure, said: "Gene therapy was conceived for the treatment of single-gene disorders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In practice, more than 70 per cent of gene therapy trials have been for cancer. This trial demonstrates that the original ideas behind gene therapy are still very much alive.''   </p>

</div><div class="author">By Jeremy Laurance   </div><div>913 words</div><div>2 May 2007</div><div>The Independent</div><div>IND</div><div>1ST</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2007 Independent & Media PLC   </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HOME | A cure for blindness is the breakthrough every scientist working in the field of opthalmology dreams about . Now, a team of gene therapy researchers at Moor fields Hospital may be on the brink . By Jeremy Laurance ++ Science in the 21st century   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">British scientists have claimed a world first for a new form of gene therapy that could help the blind to see.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Specialists at University College London and Moorfields Eye Hospital are testing the revolutionary treatment on 12 patients, who are aged between eight and their mid-20s, and have an inherited eye disorder.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique has already been shown to work in animals affected by the same disorder, called inherited retinal degeneration, and their sight was restored after treatment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If proved successful in humans, the scientists hope the technique can be extended to other forms of eye disease that affect hundreds of thousands of people in Britain and millions around the world. Professor Robin Ali, who is leading the research, said it was “very exciting” and represented “a huge step towards establishing gene therapy for the treatment of many different eye conditions”.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the professor warned that the work was at an early stage aimed at establishing the safety and efficacy of gene transfer to the eye, and that gene therapy for many common conditions including macular degeneration, which affects about 500,000 mainly elderly people in Britain, was many years away.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Ali, the head of the division of molecular therapy at UCL’s Institute of Ophthalmology said: “If we can establish the technique of delivering genes to the retina, it paves the way for applying it to other inherited disorders for which there is currently no treatment. Then in the longer term that could open the way to the treatment of common conditions such as macular degeneration, for which there are treatments but which aren’t particularly good.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The advantage of using gene therapy over drugs is that you can give it as a single treatment to the back of the eye, avoiding the need for repeated use of drugs. We anticipate the gene transfer is life long.”   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Johnson, 23, one of the 12 patients in the trial, was born with an inherited disorder called Leber’s congenital amaurosis, which has caused his sight to deteriorate progressively.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Johsnon is able to see outlines of objects in daylight but very little after dark and he has been told that his sight will worsen as he ages.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the day of his operation a few weeks ago, he told the BBC his mood was swinging from “extreme nervousness” to “a bit of excitement”. It will be months before he experiences any benefits from the treatment and only then will the researchers be able to declare it a success.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Johnson’s disorder is caused by a fault in a single gene called RPE65. The operation involved injecting normal versions of the defective gene into the pigment cells at the back of the eye. The gene is carried by a virus – modified to render it harmless – which inserts it into the cells’ DNA.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The procedure had never been attempted before and was the riskiest part of the treatment, requiring extreme surgical precision. In order to deliver the gene to as many cells as possible, a large volume of solution was injected sufficient to lift the retina causing a temporary detachment. The retina is delicate and one slip could have torn it, destroying Mr Johnson’s remaining sight. Mr Johnson was monitored to ensure his retina reattached within 24 hours.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bainbridge, a consultant ophthalmologist at Moor-fields who carried out the operation on Mr Johnson, said he was pleased with the outcome of the surgery but there was no guarantee it would be a success. “It is very encouraging that we can deliver genes to an extremely fragile site in the eye without complications. But we don’t know for sure how someone like Robert’s retina will behave in this situation,” said Dr Bainbridge. The research team has been experimenting with gene therapy for 15 years but this is the first trial in humans. Dogs affected by the disorder who were treated with the technique had their vision improved to the point where they could walk through a maze without difficulty, which they had previously been unable to do.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As inherited retinal degeneration is a progressive disorder, the best results are likely to be seen in the youngest patients, whose sight has deteriorated least. Professor Tony Moore, a retinal specialist at UCL and part of the research team, said: “Some indications of the results of the trial may be available within several months. It will be many months before we have the full picture.”   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement of the trial was welcomed by specialists in genetics. Professor Leonard Seymour, the president of the British Society for Gene Therapy, said: “The retina is a really good place for gene therapy because it can be accessed by direct injection – overcoming the problem of gene delivery. When gene delivery is efficient, the whole power of gene therapy is unleashed. The diseased cells in the retina are well documented – there is a good chance of success here.”   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research is supported with £1m from the Department of Health. Lord Hunt, the Health minister, said yesterday: “The UK leads Europe in gene therapy with over 40 per cent of clinical trials, second only to the US.”   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">BRITISH scientists have used gene therapy to restore a patient's sight in a pioneering operation that will bring hope to tens of thousands of partially blind people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robert Johnson, 23, hopes to see fully again following the surgery at Moorfields Eye Hospital in London.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr Johnson, who was born with a degenerative disorder that means he can only see outlines during the day and nothing at night, had copies of genes inserted into one of his eyes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is this will correct a genetic fault that stops his retina detecting light properly. It will be several months before it is known if the operation was a success. If it is, it offers hope to tens of thousands of people with genetic eye problems.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists warn it is more likely the procedure will only work on children and young adults because older people's eyesight may have deteriorated too much.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But they say it could lead on to advances in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration,   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">which affects 400,000 people in the UK. Lead researcher Professor Robin Ali, of University College London's institute of ophthalmology, said the clinical trial was 'exciting'.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: 'We have been developing gene therapy for eye disease for almost 15 years but until now we have been evaluating the technology only in the laboratory.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Testing it for the first time in patients is very important and exciting, and represents a huge step towards establishing gene therapy for the treatment of many different eye conditions.'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: 'There are many forms of retinal degeneration, meaning the use of gene therapy treatments must be individually developed and then tested in a separate clinical trial specifically for that disease.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'However, the results from this first human trial are likely to provide an important basis for many more gene therapy protocols in the future, as well as potentially leading to an effective treatment for a rare but debilitating disease.' Mr Johnson's disorder is caused by a faulty gene called RPE65, which stops the layer of cells at the back of the eyes, behind the retina, from working.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It results in severely impaired vision from a very young age and there are currently no effective treatments available.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the operation, Mr Johnson could see outlines during the day, but very little at night. He said: 'It's very difficult to say how I'm feeling. I keep ranging from extreme nervousness to a bit of excitement.'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trials with dogs had already shown that when the defect was restored, that they were able to walk through a maze without difficulty - indicating their vision had much improved.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During Mr Johnson's operation, donated healthy copies of the gene are loaded into the shells of viruses and injected into the cells at the back of the retina. The harmless virus shells invade the cells, spreading copies of the healthy gene.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bainbridge, who led the surgical team, said: 'It is very encouraging that we can deliver genes to an extremely fragile site in the eye without complications.'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Assisting surgeon Robert Maclaren said Mr Johnson's operation - the first of 11 planned trials - had gone 'extremely well'.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: 'We couldn't have asked for a better result. In fact, if I sat and drew what the perfect result would have been on a piece of paper, the retina would have looked pretty much as it would look now.'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although the technique is still experimental, it could eventually be used to treat a wide range of disorders.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Leonard Seymour, president of the British Society for Gene Therapy, said: 'The retina is a really good place for gene therapy because it can be accessed by direct injection - overcoming the problem of gene delivery. When gene delivery is efficient, the whole power of gene therapy is unleashed.'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andrew George, professor of molecular immunology at Imperial College, London, said: 'There is hope that once gene therapy is developed in the eye, scientists could move on to more complex organs.'   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara McLaughlin, campaigns manager at the Royal National Institute for the Blind said: 'We welcome this first clinical trial and research which may result in treatment for this currently untreatable cause of blindness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'We would be interested to learn more about developments and how the research might provide ways to combat other diseases that cause degeneration to the retina.'   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My world begins to grow dim Three years ago, Amanda Read, 27, began to lose her sight to an incurable eye disease...  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When you start losing your vision at my age it's the little things that are most irritating, like not being able to jump into my old Triumph Spitfire and go for a burn, or not being able to flirt.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year I went out to dinner with a man I knew before I began to go blind and it was a disaster. He didn't know how to handle the situation. So he was trying to read the menu to me, while I was knocking over the candle and trying not to spill anything. I certainly couldn't gaze into his eyes in a meaningful way.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My central vision began to disappear when I was 24. One morning I noticed a slight fuzzy patch in front of my left eye; I couldn't see things as clearly as I wanted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I tested myself on my computer screen at work -I worked as an administrator and realised there was a blind spot right in the middle of my vision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The local optician thought I had a swelling behind my eye, which threw me into a panic; I thought I had a brain tumour. It wasn't exactly a relief when a specialist at my local hospital in Swindon told me that I had Stargardt's macular dystrophy, but at least I knew I wasn't going to die. Stargardt's is when the cells of the macula, the centre of the eye that is responsible for fine vision, break down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It took three months of tests at hospitals in Oxford, Bristol and Swindon to confirm the diagnosis and, by this time, I had done a bit of internet research.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The websites told it to me straight: "You'll go blind." Naturally, I was pretty upset.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first there was denial and then I began relentlessly researching my family history to see where it had come from. Stargardt's is an inherited condition and for a child to get it both parents need to be carriers of a recessive gene.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, I could find no evidence of any of my relatives having the disease, but they must have been carriers. I know that my parents feel guilty and find the whole subject very painful at times. Of course, I have never blamed them. How could they have known? Scientists can't test for carriers yet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then came anger and depression. I cried a lot and began suffering panic attacks. I remember going out sailing -and going below, which was like stepping into the dark. I couldn't see anything and became very frightened. The panic attacks have stopped now, but there is still the odd day when I feel quite down.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eventually I had to quit my job and I moved in with my parents in Retford, Nottinghamshire, where I now live.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most difficult moment for me was a year after diagnosis, when my doctors told me that I had to stop driving. It may not sound important, but I know a lot of people find this very hard because it means that you are giving up your independence. The one saving grace was that I had been warned in advance of this, so a few months before I had bought an old Triumph Spitfire and really made the most of that time bombing around. It helped me to accept that I was hanging up the car keys for good.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Funnily enough, the decision to stop driving helped me to come to terms with my diminishing vision as it made me deal with the situation before I became partially sighted.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few months later, in November 2005, my sight was tested by a hospital consultant, who registered me as partially sighted. Then there was really no going back. The hospital consultant asked how many fingers I could see. I had to admit I couldn't even see her hand. By now the vision in my right eye was also affected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, my sight has deteriorated further. There is no real prognosis; it will just steadily deteriorate, but I will probably retain some vision around the edges. However, I'm a firm believer that science will find a cure in my lifetime, using stem cells or gene therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What really helped was talking to another sufferer. Not long after I received a diagnosis, I contacted the Macular Disease Society, who put me in touch with a woman who, despite the condition, was leading a pretty normal life, with a job, marriage and children. "This won't hurt you," she said. "You will have a normal life. You've just got to adjust."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now I am halfway through a part-time degree in humanities, taking clarinet lessons and I've started a group for young sufferers of visual impairment so that we can chat about how we feel and the challenges we face.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My biggest challenge seems to be when I go to the pub. My peripheral vision is still good but, in a crowded noisy pub I need the help of my friends waving their arms or shouting my name before I can find them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At home, I have to be careful preparing food or pouring boiling water into mugs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But I don't like being mollycoddled so I prefer not to ask my parents for help unless I absolutely have to. I usually take a friend shopping with me as my colour vision is poor, and I tend to buy a lot of red and black clothes as I can distinguish those colours most easily.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This year I am hoping to do a wing walk on a plane for charity, and I'll be the lucky one, because looking down won't frighten me. But then, I have to say, not much does these days.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Macular degeneration is the most common form of visual impairment in the UK.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The macula is the centre of the retina (see diagram), which is the part of the eye containing light-sensitive cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* When the cells in the macula break down, sight is lost in the central field of vision. Peripheral vision is unaffected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* The condition begins with small distortions in vision in one or both eyes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* There are more than 1,500 conditions under the term macular degeneration. They all affect central vision.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 500,000 people in the UK suffer from macular eye conditions  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* 50 per cent of people with the disease inherit it; and the other 50 per cent get the disease as a result of age, smoking and other factors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* Men and woman are affected equally.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* There is no cure for the condition, but binocular lenses and magnifying screens can help.  </p>

</div><div class="author">David Bradford   </div><div>1801 words</div><div>20 February 2007</div><div>The Independent</div><div>IND</div><div>1ST</div><div>12,13</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2007 Independent & Media PLC   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">EXTRA | Motorcycling was his passion in life. But a routine eye test showed that David Bradford would never be able to ride again – and worse was to come   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nothing in life prepares you for finding out that you are going blind. I had no idea there was any problem with my eyesight until I casually mentioned to my optician, at a routine sight test, that I struggle to see in the dark. She made a detailed examination of my eyes and said nothing, but I knew from the look on her face that she had seen something ominous. I was told to go back the following day for a visual fields test. This assesses peripheral vision, and involves staring at a central dot of light inside a darkened box and pressing a button each time you catch a glimpse of another dot of light, away from the centre point. I waited and waited, staring into blackness, detecting no flashes until the final stages of the test. My heart sank; I knew something was seriously wrong. The optician’s verdict began with those fateful words that only ever preface truly awful news: “I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but…”   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sorry to tell me that my peripheral vision does not meet the standard required for driving. How did this happen? One minute, I’m happily reading the optician’s test chart to confirm, as usual, that my mild short-sightedness hasn’t got any worse, the next I’m losing my driving licence and my life is in disarray. It doesn’t get a lot worse than this, I thought. I was wrong.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The optician refused to be drawn on why my peripheral vision was subnormal, but it took no more than a couple of minutes of Googling to discover the most likely diagnosis – retinitis pigmentosa (RP). I discovered, with increasing dread, that RP is the name given to a group of genetic conditions that affect the light-receptive cells in the retina at the back of the eyes. Self-diagnosis using the internet is a dangerous game that often leads to unfounded fear, but the descriptions of RP matched perfectly my own circumstances. I discovered that RP manifests itself first as night-blindness and causes the loss of peripheral sight, leading to tunnel vision. Then the hammer blow that left me sick with despair: RP is progressive and ultimately leads to blindness, and there is no treatment or cure.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My life was taking a turn over which neither I nor the medical profession had any control. This just wasn’t in the script. How can I be going blind? Where were the warning signs? Sure, I struggle getting around at night, but that’s been the case for as long as I can remember. I can recall night-fishing trips as a teenager when I’d stumble chaotically over bags and equipment. If by luck a fish was hooked, I’d rely on friends to help get it netted and guide me back to the tent. It was obvious that my pals could distinguish basic shapes and contrasts after dark, whereas all I could see was opaque blackness. In daylight, my vision was apparently as good as theirs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Poor night vision had never held me back. My family lived deep in the Sussex countryside, miles from anywhere, so I was keen to get my own wheels as soon as possible. At 16, I bought a moped and, at 17, took my motorcycle test and got my first “proper bike”. Motorcycling became an all-consuming passion. Despite riding almost every day, in darkness as well as daylight, my vision never caused a mishap on the road. Just as I’d adapted to poor night vision in other aspects of life, I rode accordingly after dark.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After university, I pursued my love for bikes by taking a job on a motorcycle trade magazine. Writing about my hobby seemed a great way to earn a living. Two years later, I landed my dream job and became a staff writer at SuperBike Magazine, Britain’s top-selling sports-bike magazine. I am 24 now and still writing for SuperBike, but I will never again ride a motorcycle on the public highway. The DVLA revoked my driving licence shortly before Christmas because my peripheral vision falls short of their rigid requirements. The impact has been twofold. Firstly, there’s the personal desolation at losing what is not only a treasured pastime but also a means to independence and freedom. Secondly, there’s the professional diminution at having lost the ability to perform a key part of my job, which is also the part with all the perks and fun – road-testing the latest machines.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In RP sufferers, peripheral vision is lost gradually, usually ebbing away from the edges and spreading inward toward the centre, causing so-called tunnel vision. My case is atypical in that my mid-peripheral vision has been affected first. I still have a wide visual field but there are missing spots of vision between the centre and the periphery. In practice, this means I can see whatever I’m directly looking at and whatever is directly to the sides, above or below, but the immediate foreground is disrupted. I’m told these blind spots will get larger and spread outward, leaving just a central area of useful sight.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Approximately one in 3,500 people in the UK are affected by RP and it is the most common cause of blindness among young people. Even so, I had never heard of it, nor had any of my colleagues, friends or family. Most cases of RP are diagnosed between the ages of 10 and 30, and many sufferers are legally blind by the age of 40, but there are many different forms of the disorder. In fact, the singular name retinitis pigmentosa, coined by Dr Franciscus Donders in 1857, is considered inappropriate by modern ophthalmology, which prefers the collective label “retinal dystrophies”.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Naturally, my first question to the consultant was, how quickly will my sight deteriorate? The answer was maddeningly indefinite; the symptoms of RP generally worsen slowly, and many sufferers retain some useful vision well into old age. But the rate of loss is not always constant and periods of rapid loss may occur. It is impossible to give an accurate prognosis in cases such as mine, in which there is no family history. There is no family history because I have, in effect, inherited the condition in two halves from my parents – one faulty gene from each.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is currently no treatment or cure for any type of RP, but exciting progress is being made in several key areas of investigation. Gene therapy and stem-cell research, in particular, are showing great promise – and creating big news splashes. The three-tiered mission for researchers is to discover which genes cause RP (“gene mapping”), identify the exact nature of these genes (“gene cloning”), and find out exactly how and why they damage the retina. This is a long, painstaking process and so far only a small proportion of the genes and genetic mutations responsible for RP have been mapped and cloned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the eye is particularly suited to gene therapy, and trials have already achieved encouraging results. In one trial, corrective genes inserted into the eyes of mice were shown to halt retinal degeneration, while another trial using dogs actually restored sight in seven of the eight animals treated. A bold new trial, focusing on the same gene but involving human patients, will begin at Moorfields Eye Hospital, in London, later this year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">“The RPE65 [name of the gene] trial is the first of its kind and it’s great that Britain is leading the way. Its effects should be seen quite quickly, within some months, and, if successful, will represent a crucial step forward,” says Professor John Marshall, Frost Professor of Ophthalmology at St Thomas’ Hospital, London.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite the potential of this trial, each type of RP is different and requires a different treatment; one success opens the door for another rather than provides a universal solution. When I ask Professor Marshall whether it is realistic to hope for a treatment or cure within my lifetime, he advises cautious optimism, “Although there is still a mountain to climb in terms of understanding RP, research is slowly but surely filling in the gaps and providing the full picture that will be needed in order to defeat all retinal dystrophies.”   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Apart from being prohibited from driving, my life is not yet affected, and I’m doing my best to stay positive. My predicament is difficult for other people to comprehend; I have been stripped of my licence and told I’m losing my sight, yet, to all intents and purposes, I can see perfectly well. I am aware that this will become a greater problem as my sight deteriorates, and testing challenges lie ahead. My priority, however, is to make the most of my sight while it is still serviceable, without becoming angry about the fate I’ve been dealt. Incredibly, I feel stronger and more resolute since being diagnosed, which is a reaction I would never have anticipated. Whether I’m trying to run faster, write better, or just win an argument, I feel propelled forward by a new impetus. My motorcycling days may be over but I’m determined to invest that passion elsewhere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A common condition with no cure   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RP is the most common cause of blindness among young people in the developed world, affecting one in 3,500 people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is the name given to a group of inherited disorders that harm the function of the retina, the portion of the eye responsible for transmitting light messages to the brain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retina has two main layers, the pigment epithelium, which provides the retina’s nourishment, and a thicker layer, the neural retina, which is made up of layers of photoreceptor (light-sensitive) cells. RP affects both layers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are two types of photoreceptor cells – rods, used for peripheral vision and in poor light, and cones, responsible for seeing colour and detail. RP affects both cells.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RP is usually diagnosed between the ages of 10 and 30. The first symptom is night-blindness but it leads to the loss of peripheral sight (tunnel vision) and ultimately blindness.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There is currently no treatment or cure for RP.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are five key methods of potential treatment under investigation: transplanting healthy cells into the retina; implanting microchips that mimic the action of photoreceptor cells; inserting healthy DNA using gene therapy; generating new retinal cells from stem cells; and protecting retinal cells using neuro-protection agents.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A Faulty gene that causes blindness in chickens could help scientists prevent not only blindness in humans, but also heart disease, diabetes and perhaps even infant mortality.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery has been made by researchers at Abertay University, in Dundee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biotechnologist Dr Doug Lester and PhD student Hemanth Tummala were searching for the genetic mutation behind a condition known as retinopathy globe enlarged (RGE) which causes affected chickens to go blind within six to eight weeks of hatching.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Working with colleagues at Leeds University and the Roslin Institute, Edinburgh, they traced the reason to a mutation in the GNB3 gene, which eliminates an essential amino acid, hampering normal eye development.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the GNB3 gene is also vital for the function of other important body organs, Dr Lester believes the mutation could be a key factor in a wide range of human disorders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It happens to be the same gene that predisposes humans to low birth weight, obesity, heart disease, hypertension and a whole range of other conditions," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Further studies are now being carried out to see if the chickens also suffer from high blood pressure, and if humans with inherited retinal degeneration also have mutations in this gene.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Lester said a similar mutation was probably responsible for the inherited eye disorder known as cone-rod dystrophy, which robs patients of their central colour vision in early adulthood, followed by their peripheral black and white vision. Until now the GNB3 gene has not been considered a factor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the long term, it is hoped scientists might develop gene therapy to prevent this deterioration, or perhaps even restore sight to patients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the Dundee scientists are able to prove a link between the faulty GNB3 gene and other health disorders, it could hold out hope of treatment for millions of people with potentially deadly conditions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breakthrough for human health is a side-effect of Dr Lester's research programme, which was launched purely to look into blindness in chickens. He said recent development in genetic research had dramatically speeded up the pace of his work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He added: "When I started out on this project seven years ago, it was purely to look into the reasons for blindness in chickens. We had no idea that it was going to go in this direction, so we're really very excited about where we are today."  </p>
