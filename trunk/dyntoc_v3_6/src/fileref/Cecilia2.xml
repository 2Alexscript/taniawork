<lb />respected be their remains, and immortalized their
<lb />virtues! may time, while it moulders their frail relics
<lb />to dust, commit to tradition the record of their good&shy;
<lb />ness! and oh may their orphan-descendant be influ&shy;
<lb />enced through life by the remembrance of their purity,
<lb />and in death be solaced, that by her it was unsullied!</q></p>
<p><lb />Such was the secret prayer with which the only sur&shy;
<lb ></lb>vivor of the Beverley family quitted the abode of her
<lb />youth, and residence of her fore-fathers; while tears of
<lb />recollecting sorrow filled her eyes, and obstructed the
<lb />last view of her native town which had excited them.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, this fair traveller, had lately entered into
<lb />the one-and-twentieth year of her age.  Her ances&shy;
	  <lb />tors had been rich farmers in the county of <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>,
<lb />though her father, in whom a spirit of elegance had
<lb />supplanted the rapacity of wealth, had spent his time
<lb />as a private country gentleman, satisfied, without in&shy;
<lb />creasing his store, to live upon what he inherited from
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">A</mw>
<pb n="002" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">6</mw>
<lb />the labours of his predecessors.  She had lost him in
<lb />her early youth, and her mother had not long sur&shy;
<lb />vived him.  They had bequeathed to her 10,000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. and
<lb />consigned her to the care of the Dean of &mdash;&mdash;, her
<lb />uncle.  With this gentleman, in whom, by various
<lb />contingencies, the accumulated possessions of a rising
<lb />and prosperous family were centred, she had passed
<lb />the last four years of her life; and a few weeks only
<lb />had yet elapsed since his death, which, by depriving
<lb />her of her last relation, made her heiress to an estate
<lb />of 3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. per annum; with no other restriction than
<lb />that of annexing her name, if she married, to the dis&shy;
<lb />posal of her hand and riches.</p>
<p><lb />But though thus largely indebted to fortune, to
<lb />nature she had yet greater obligations:  her form was
<lb />elegant, her heart was liberal; her countenance an&shy;
<lb />nounced the intelligence of her mind, her complexion
<lb />varied with every emotion of her soul, and her eyes,
<lb />the heralds of her speech, now beamed with under&shy;
<lb />standing, and now glistened with sensibility.</p>
<p><lb />For the short period of her minority, the manage&shy;
<lb />ment of her fortune, and the care of her person, had
<lb />been entrusted by the Dean to three guardians, among
<lb />whom her own choice was to settle her residence:
<lb />but her mind, saddened by the loss of all her natural
<lb />friends, coveted to regain its serenity in the quietness
<lb />of the country, and in the bosom of an aged and ma&shy;
<lb />ternal counsellor, whom she loved as her mother, and
<lb />to whom she had been known from her childhood.</p>
<p><lb />The Deanery, indeed, she was obliged to relin&shy;
<lb />quish, a long repining expectant being eager by en&shy;
<lb />tering it, to bequeath to another the anxiety and
<lb />suspense he had suffered himself, though probably
<pb n="003" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="A2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">7</mw>
<lb />without much impatience to shorten their duration in
	  <lb />favour of the next successor; but the house of <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Charlton</persName>, her benevolent friend, was open for her re&shy;
<lb />ception, and the alleviating tenderness of her conver&shy;
<lb />sation took from her all wish of changing it.</p>
<p><lb />Here she had dwelt since the interment of her
<lb />uncle; and here, from the affectionate gratitude of
<lb />her disposition, she had perhaps been content to dwell
<lb />till her own, had not her guardians interfered to re&shy;
<lb />move her.</p>
<p><lb />Reluctantly she complied; she quitted her early
<lb />companions, the friend she most revered, and the spot
<lb />which contained the relicks of all she had yet lived to
<lb />lament; and, accompanied by one of her guardians,
<lb />and attended by two servants, she began her journey
	  <lb />from <placeName>Bury</placeName> to <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, this gentleman, though in the prime of
<lb />his life, though gay, fashionable and splendid, had been
<lb />appointed by her uncle to be one of her trustees; a
<lb />choice which had for object the peculiar gratification
	  <lb />of his niece, whose most favourite young friend <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> had married, and in whose house he therefore
<lb />knew she would most wish to live.</p>
<p><lb />Whatever good-nature could dictate or politeness
	  <lb />suggest to dispel her melancholy, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> failed
	  <lb />not to urge; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in whose disposition sweet&shy;
<lb />ness was tempered with dignity, and gentleness with
<lb />fortitude, suffered not his kind offices to seem ineffec&shy;
<lb />tual; she kissed her hand at the last glimpse a friendly
<lb />hill afforded of her native town, and made an effort to
<lb />forget the regret with which she lost sight of it.  She
<lb />revived her spirits by plans of future happiness, dwelt
<lb />upon the delight with which she should meet her
<pb n="004" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="A2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">8</mw>
<lb />young friend, and, by accepting his consolation, amply
<lb />rewarded his trouble.</p>
<p><lb />Her serenity, however, had yet another, though
<lb />milder trial to undergo, since another friend was yet
<lb />to be met, and another farewel was yet to be taken.</p>
<p>	  <lb />At the distance of seven miles from <placeName>Bury</placeName> resided
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, the richest and most powerful man in
	  <lb />that neighbourhood, at whose house <persName>Cecilia</persName> and her
<lb />guardian were invited to breakfast in their journey.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who was the younger son of a
<lb />noble family, was a man of parts, information and sa&shy;
<lb />gacity; to great native strength of mind he added a
<lb />penetrating knowledge of the world, and to faculties
<lb />the most skilful of investigating the character of
<lb />every other, a dissimulation the most profound in
<lb />concealing his own.  In the bloom of his youth, im&shy;
<lb />patient for wealth and ambitious of power, he had
<lb />tied himself to a rich dowager of quality, whose age,
<lb />though sixty-seven, was but among the smaller spe&shy;
<lb />cies of her evil properties, her disposition being far
<lb />more repulsive than her wrinkles.  An inequality of
<lb />years so considerable, had led him to expect that the
<lb />fortune he thus acquired, would speedily be re&shy;
<lb />leased from the burthen with which it was at present
<lb />incumbered; but his expectations proved as vain as
<lb />they were mercenary, and his lady was not more the
<lb />dupe of his protestations, than he was himself of his
<lb />own purposes.  Ten years he had been married to
<lb />her, yet her health was good, and her faculties were
<lb />unimpaired; eagerly he had watched for her dissolu&shy;
<lb />tion, yet his eagerness had injured no health but his
<lb />own!  So short-sighted is selfish cunning, that in
<lb />aiming no further than at the gratification of the

<lb />present moment, it obscures the evils of the future,
<lb />while it impedes the perception of integrity and
<lb />honour.</p>
<p>His ardour, however, to attain the blest period of
<lb />returning liberty, deprived him neither of spirit nor
<lb />inclination for intermediate enjoyment; he knew the
<lb />world too well to incur its censure by ill-treating the
<lb />woman to whom he was indebted for the rank he held
<lb />in it; he saw her, indeed, but seldom, yet he had the
<lb />decency, alike in avoiding as in meeting her, to show
<lb />no abatement of civility and good-breeding:  but,
<lb />having thus sacrificed to ambition all possibility of
<lb />happiness in domestic life, he turned his thoughts to
<lb />those other methods of procuring it, which he had so
<lb />dearly purchased the power of essaying.</p>
<p>The resources of pleasure to the possessors of
<lb />wealth are only to be cut off by the satiety of which
<lb />they are productive:  a satiety which the vigorous
	  <lb />mind of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had not yet suffered him to
<lb />experience; his time, therefore, was either devoted
<lb />to the expensive amusements of the metropolis, or
<lb />spent in the country among the gayest of its diver&shy;
<lb />sions.</p>
<p><lb />The little knowledge of fashionable manners and
	  <lb />of the characters of the times of which <persName>Cecilia</persName> was yet
<lb />mistress, she had gathered at the house of this gen&shy;
<lb />tleman, with whom the Dean her Uncle had been inti&shy;
<lb />mately connected:  for as he preserved to the world
<lb />the same appearance of decency he supported to his
<lb />wife, he was every where well received, and being but
<lb />partially known, was extremely respected:  the world,
<lb />with its wonted facility, repaying his circumspect at&shy;
<lb />tention to its laws, by silencing the voice of censure,

<milestone unit="sig" n="B1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">10</mw>
<lb />guarding his character from impeachment, and his
<lb />name from reproach.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> had been known to him half her life; she
<lb />had been caressed in his house as a beautiful child,
<lb />and her presence was now solicited there as an amia&shy;
<lb />ble aquaintance.  Her visits, indeed, had by no
	  <lb />means been frequent, as the ill-humour of <persName>Lady Mar&shy;
<lb />garet Monckton</persName> had rendered them painful to her:
<lb />yet the opportunities they had afforded her of mixing
<lb />with people of fashion, had served to prepare her for
<lb />the new scenes in which she was soon to be a per&shy;
<lb />former.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, in return, had always been a wel&shy;
<lb />come guest at the Deanery; his conversation was to
<lb />Cecilia a never-failing source of information, as his
<lb />knowledge of life and manners enabled him to start
<lb />those subjects of which she was most ignorant; and
<lb />her mind, copius for the admission, and intelligent
<lb />for the arrangement of knowledge, received all new
<lb />ideas with avidity.</p>
<p><lb />Pleasure given in Society, like money lent in usury,
<lb />returns with interest to those who dispense it:  and
	  <lb />the discourse of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> conferred not a greater
	  <lb />favour upon <persName>Cecilia</persName> than her attention to it repaid.
<lb />And thus, the speaker and the hearer being mutually
<lb />gratified, they had always met with complacency, and
<lb />commonly parted with regret.</p>
<p><lb />This reciprocation of pleasure had, however, pro&shy;
<lb />duced different effects upon their minds; the ideas of
	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> were enlarged, while the reflections of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> were embittered.  He here saw an object,
<lb />who to all the advantages of that wealth he had so
<lb />highly prized, added youth, beauty, and intelligence;
<pb n="009" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">11</mw>
<lb />though much her senior, he was by no means of an
<lb />age to render his addressing her an impropriety,
<lb />and the entertainment she received from his conver
<lb />sation, persuaded him that her good opinion might
<lb />with ease be improved into a regard the most partial.
<lb />He regretted the venal rapacity with which he had sa&shy;
<lb />crificed himself to a woman he abhorred, and his
<lb />wishes for her final decay became daily more fervent.
	  <lb />He knew that the acquaintance of <persName>Cecilia</persName> was con&shy;
<lb />fined to a circle of which he was himself the principal
<lb />ornament, that she had rejected all the proposals of
<lb />marriage which had hitherto been made to her, and,
<lb />as he had sedulously watched her from her earliest
<lb />years, he had reason to believe that her heart had
<lb />escaped any dangerous impression.  This being her
<lb />situation, he had long looked upon her as his future
<lb />property; as such he had indulged his admira&shy;
<lb />tion, and as such he had already appropriated her
<lb />estate, though he had not more vigilantly inspected
<lb />into her sentiments, than he had guarded his own
<lb />from a similar scrutiny.</p>
<p><lb />The death of the Dean had, indeed, much alarmed
	  <lb />him; he grieved at her leaving <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, where he
<lb />considered himself the first man, alike in parts and in
	  <lb />consequence, and he dreaded her residing in <placeName>London</placeName>,
<lb />where he foresaw that numerous rivals, equal to him&shy;
<lb />self in talents and riches, would speedily surround
<lb />her; rivals, too, youthful and sanguine, not shackled
<lb />by present ties, but at liberty to solicit her immediate
<lb />acceptance.  Beauty and independence, rarely found
<lb />together, would attract a crowd of suitors at once
	  <lb />brilliant and assiduous; and the house of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />was eminent for its elegance and gaiety; but yet,
<pb n="010" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">12</mw>
<lb />undaunted by danger, and confiding in his own
<lb />powers, he determined to pursue the project he had
<lb />formed, not fearing by address and perseverance to
<lb />ensure its success.</p></div>

	<p><persName><hi rend="case(allcaps)">Mr.</hi> Monckton</persName> had, at this time, a party of com&shy;
<lb />pany assembled at his house for the purpose of spend
<lb />ing the Christmas holidays.  He waited with anxiety
	  <lb />the arrival of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and flew to hand her from th<sic corr="e">&invertede;</sic>
	  <lb />chaise before <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> could alight.  He observed

	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, perceiving her aversion, though ignorant of
<lb />its cause, took care to avoid all intercourse with her
<lb />but what ceremony exacted, and pitied in secret the
<lb />unfortunate lot of her friend.</p>
<p><lb />The company now present consisted of one lady
<lb />and several gentlemen.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Miss Bennet</persName>, the Lady, was in every sense of the
	  <lb />phrase, the humble companion of <persName>Lady Margaret</persName>;
<lb />she was low-born, meanly educated, and narrow&shy;
<lb />minded; a stranger alike to innate merit or acquired
<lb />accomplishments, yet skilful in the art of flattery,
<lb />and an adept in every species of low cunning.  With
<lb />no other view in life than the attainment of affluence
<lb />without labour, she was not more the slave of the mis&shy;
<lb />tress of the house, than the tool of its master; re&shy;
<lb />ceiving indignity without murmur, and submitting to
<lb />contempt as a thing of course.</p>
<p><lb />Among the gentlemen, the most conspicious, by
	  <lb />means of his dress, was <persName>Mr. Aresby</persName>, a captain in the
<lb />militia; a young man who, having frequently heard
<lb />the words red-coat and gallantry put together, ima&shy;
<lb />gined the conjunction not merely customary, but ho&shy;
<lb />nourable, and therefore, without even pretending to
<lb />think of the service of his country, he considered a
<lb />cockade as a badge of politeness, and wore it but to
<lb />mark his devotion to the ladies, whom he held him&shy;
<lb />self equipped to conquer, and bound to adore.</p>
<p><lb />The next, who by forwardness the most officious,
	  <lb />took care to be noticed, was <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, a young
<lb />lawyer, who, though rising in his profession, owed
<lb />his success neither to distinguished abilities, nor to
<lb />skill-supplying industry, but to the art of uniting
<lb />suppleness to others with confidence in himself.  To
<pb n="014" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">14</mw>
<lb />a reverence of rank, talents, and fortune the most
<lb />profound, he joined an assurance in his own merit,
<lb />which no superiority could depress; and with a pre&shy;
<lb />sumption which encouraged him to aim at all things,
<lb />he blended a good-humour that no mortification
<lb />could lessen.  And while by the pliability of his
<lb />disposition he avoided making enemies, by his readi&shy;
<lb />ness to oblige, he learned the surest way of making
<lb />friends, by becoming useful to them.</p>
<p><lb />There were also some neighbouring squires; and
<lb />there was one old gentleman, who, without seeming
<lb />to notice any of the company, sat frowning in a
<lb />corner.</p>
<p>	  <lb />But the principal figure in the circle was <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName>, a tall, thin young man, whose face was all ani&shy;
<lb />mation, and whose eyes sparkled with intelligence.
<lb />He had been intended by his father for trade, but his
<lb />spirit, soaring above the occupation for which he was
<lb />designed, from repining led him to resist, and from
<lb />resisting, to rebel.  He eloped from his friends, and
<lb />contrived to enter the army.  But, fond of the polite
<lb />arts, and eager for the acquirement of knowledge, he
<lb />found not this way of life much better adapted to
<lb />his inclination than that from which he had escaped;
<lb />he soon grew weary of it, was reconciled to his fa&shy;
<lb />ther, and entered at the Temple.  But here, too vo&shy;
<lb />latile for serious study, and too gay for laborious ap&shy;
<lb />plication, he made little progress:  and the same
<lb />quickness of parts and vigour of imagination which,
<lb />united with prudence or accompanied by judgment,
<lb />might have raised him to the head of his profession,
<lb />being unhappily associated with fickleness and caprice,
<lb />served only to impede his improvement, and obstruct
<pb n="015" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B5r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">15</mw>
<lb />his preferment.  And now, with little business, and
<lb />that little neglected, a small fortune, and that fortune
<lb />daily becoming less, the admiration of the world, but
<lb />that admiration ending simply in civility, he lived an
<lb />unsettled and unprofitable life, generally caressed,
<lb />and universally sought, yet careless of his interest,
<lb />and thoughtless of the future; devoting his time to
<lb />company, his income to dissipation, and his heart to
<lb />the Muses.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q001" next="q002">I bring you,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, as he attend&shy;
	  <lb />ed <persName>Cecilia</persName> into the room, <q id="q002" prev="q001">a subject of sorrow in a
<lb />young lady who never gave disturbance to her
<lb />friends but in quitting them.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q003" next="q004">If sorrow,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, darting upon
<lb />her his piercing eyes, <q id="q004" prev="q003">wears in your part of the
<lb />world a form such as this, who would wish to change
<lb />it for a view of joy?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>She's divinely handsome, indeed!</q> cried the
<lb />captain, affecting an involuntary exclamation.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Mean time, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was placed next to the
	  <lb />lady of the house, quietly began her breakfast; <persName>Mr.
<lb />Morrice</persName>, the young lawyer, with the most easy free&shy;
	  <lb />dom, seating himself at her side, while <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>
<lb />was elsewhere arranging the rest of his guests, in
<lb />order to secure that place for himself.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, without ceremony, attacked his fair
<lb />neighbour; he talked of her journey, and the pros&shy;
<lb />pects of gaiety which it opened to her view; but by
<lb />these finding her unmoved, he changed his theme,
<lb />and expatiated upon the delights of the spot she was
<lb />quitting.  Studious to recommend himself to her
<lb />notice, and indifferent by what means, one moment he
<lb />flippantly extolled the entertainments of the town,
<pb n="016" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B5v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">16</mw>
<lb />and the next, rapturously described the charms of
<lb />the country.  A word, a look, sufficed to mark her
<lb />approbation or dissent, which he no sooner discovered,
<lb />that he slided into her opinion, with as much faci&shy;
<lb />lity and satisfaction as if it had originally been his
<lb />own.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, suppressing his chagrin, waited
<lb />some time in expectation that when this young man
<lb />saw he was standing, he would yield to him his chair:
<lb />but the remark was not made, and the resignation
<lb />was not thought of.  The captain, too, regarding
<lb />the lady as his natural property for the morning,
<lb />perceived with indignation by whom he was sup&shy;
<lb />planted; while the company in general saw, with
<lb />much surprize, the place they had severally forborne
<lb />to occupy from respect to their host, thus familiarly
<lb />seized upon by the man who, in the whole room,
<lb />had the least claim, either from age or rank, to con&shy;
<lb />sult nothing but his own inclination.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, however, when he found that deli&shy;
<lb />cacy and good-manners had no weight with his
<lb />guest, thought it most expedient to allow them none
<lb />with himself; and therefore, dis&shy;
<lb />guising his displeasure under a guise of facetiousness, he
	  <lb />called out, <q>Come, <persName>Morrice</persName>, you that love Christ&shy;
<lb />mas sports, what say you to the game of move&shy;
<lb />all?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>I like it of all things!</q> answered <persName>Morrice</persName>, and

<lb />court new acquaintance, though perhaps not yet
<lb />avowedly delivered as a precept from parents to chil&shy;

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q019" next="q020">But not,</q> exclaimed <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<q id="q020" prev="q019" next="q021">if he has

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q022" next="q023">Deviations from common rules,</q> said <persName>Mr.

<lb />ruption, <q id="q023" prev="q022">when they proceed from genius, are not
	    <lb />merely pardonable, but admirable; and you, <persName>Belfield</persName>,
<lb />have a peculiar right to plead their merits; but so

<lb />better reason and impelled his conduct, how noble

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q026" next="q027">All this,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, <q id="q027" prev="q026">is but the
<lb />doctrine of a lively imagination, that looks upon im&shy;
<lb />possibilities simply as difficulties, and upon difficulties
<lb />as mere invitations to victory.  But experience
<lb />teaches another lesson; experience shews that the op&shy;
<lb />position of an individual to a community is always
<lb />dangerous in the operation, and seldom successful in
<lb />the event;&mdash;never, indeed, without a concurrence,
<lb />strange as desirable, of fortunate circumstances with

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q028" next="q029">And why is this,</q> returned <persName>Belfield</persName>, <q id="q029" prev="q028">but be&shy;
<lb />cause the attempt is so seldom made?  The pitiful
<lb />prevalence of general conformity extirpates genius,
<lb />and murders originality; man is brought up, not as
<lb />if he were <q>the noblest work of God,</q> but as a
<lb />mere ductile machine of human formation:  he is
<lb />early taught that he must neither consult his under&shy;
<lb />standing, nor pursue his inclinations, lest, unhappily
<lb />for his commerce with the world, his understanding
<lb />should be averse to fools, and provoke him to despise
<lb />them; and his inclinations to the tyranny of perpe&shy;
<lb />tual restraint, and give him the courage to abjure it.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q030" next="q031">I am ready enough to allow,</q> answered <persName>Mr.

<lb />out any settled plan or prudential restriction; but
<lb />would you, therefore, grant the same license to every

	  <lb />And now not without some difficulty could <persName>Mr.

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q041" next="q042">Temptation,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, <q id="q042" prev="q041">is very easy

<p><lb />The usual ceremonies of leave-taking now fol&shy;
<lb />lowed, and the captain with most obsequious reve&shy;

<lb />but in the midst of the dumb eloquence of his vows and

<p>	  <lb />The Captain shrugged and retired.  But <persName>Mr.

<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, in leading her to the chaise, again

	<p>As soon as they lost sight of the house, <persName>Cecilia</persName> ex&shy;
<lb />pressed her surprise at the behaviour of the old gen&shy;

<lb />seclusion from the company, and absence of mind,
<lb />had strongly excited her curiosity.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> could give her very little satisfaction:
<lb />he told her that he had twice or thrice met him in
<lb />public places, where every body remarked the singu&shy;
<lb />larity of his manners and appearance, but that he

<p><lb />The conversation then turned upon the family they

<lb />friendship of a man who had so extensive a know&shy;
<lb />ledge of the world.</p>
	<p><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> professed himself well satisfied that she
<lb />should have such a counsellor; for though but little
<lb />acquainted with him, he knew he was a man of for&shy;
<lb />tune and fashion, and well esteemed in the world.
<lb />They mutually compassionated his unhappy situation
	  <lb />in domestic life, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> inoccently expressed her
	  <lb />concern at the dislike <persName>Lady Margaret</persName> seemed to have
	  <lb />taken to her; a dislike which <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> naturally
<lb />imputed to her youth and beauty, yet without sus&shy;
<lb />pecting any cause more cogent than a general jea&shy;
<lb />lousy of attractions of which she had herself so long
<lb />outlived the possession.</p>
<p><lb />As their journey drew near to its conclusion, all
<lb />the uneasy and disagreeable sensations which in the
	  <lb />bosom of <persName>Cecilia</persName> had accompanied its commencement,
<lb />gave way to the expectation of quick approaching
<lb />happiness in again meeting her favourite young friend.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> had in childhood been her playmate,
<lb />and in youth her school-fellow; a similarity of dispo&shy;
<lb />sition with respect to sweetness of temper, had early
<lb />rendered them dear to each other, though the resem&shy;
	  <lb />blance extended no further, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> having no
<lb />pretensions to the wit or understanding of her friend;
<lb />but she was amiable and obliging, and therefore suffi&shy;
<lb />ciently deserving affection, though neither blazing
<lb />with attractions which laid claim to admiration, nor
<lb />endowed with those superior qualities which mingle
<lb />respect in the love they inspire.</p>
<p><lb />From the time of her marriage, which was near
	  <lb />three years, she had entirely quitted <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, and had

<p><lb />As soon as their mutual salutations, expressions of

<p><lb /><q id="q076" next="q077">They are all people who particularly desired
<lb />to see you,</q> she answered, <q id="q077" prev="q076">and I had them by way
<lb />of entertaining you, as I was afraid you would be out
	    <lb />of spirits at leaving <placeName>Bury</placeName>.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, finding the kindness of her intentions for&shy;
<lb />bore any further expostulation, and quietly followed
<lb />her to the drawing-room.  But as the door was
<lb />opened, she was struck with amazement upon finding
<lb />that the apartment, which was spacious, lighted with
<lb />brilliancy, and decorated with magnificence, was more
<lb />than half filled with company, every one of which
<lb />was dressed with gaiety and profusion.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who from the word friends, expected to
<lb />have seen a small and private party, selected for the
<lb />purpose of social converse, started involuntarily at
<lb />the sight before her, and had hardly courage to
<lb />proceed.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, however, took her hand, and intro&shy;
<pb n="030" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">28</mw>
<lb />duced her to the whole company, who were all se&shy;
<lb />verally named to her; a ceremonial which, though
<lb />not merely agreeable but even necessary to those who
<lb />live in the gay world, in order to obviate distressing
<lb />mistakes, or unfortunate implications in discourse,
	  <lb />would by <persName>Cecilia</persName> have been willingly dispensed with,
<lb />since to her their names were as new as their per&shy;
<lb />sons, and since knowing nothing of their histories,
<lb />parties or connections, she could to nothing allude;
<lb />it therefore served but to heighten her colour and in&shy;
<lb />crease her embarrassment.</p>
<p><lb />A native dignity of mind, however, which had early
<lb />taught her to distinguish modesty from bashfulness,
<lb />enabled her in a short time to conquer her surprise,
	  <lb />and recover her composure.  She entreated <persName>Mrs. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName> to apologise for her appearance, and being seated
<lb />between two young ladies, endeavoured to seem re&shy;
<lb />conciled to it herself.</p>
<p><lb />Nor was this very difficult; for while her dress,
<lb />which she had not changed since her journey, joined to
<lb />the novelty of her face, attracted general observation,
<lb />the report of her fortune, which had preceded her en&shy;
<lb />trance, secured to her general respect.  She soon
<lb />found, too, that a company was not necessarily formid&shy;
<lb />able because full dressed, that familiarity could be
<lb />united with magnificence, and that though, to her,
<lb />every one seemed attired to walk in a procession, or
<lb />to grace a drawing-room, no formality was assumed,
<lb />and no solemnity was affected:  every one was with&shy;
<lb />out restraint, even rank obtained but little distinc&shy;
<lb />tion; ease was the general plan, and entertainment
<lb />the general pursuit.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though new to <placeName>London</placeName>, which city the ill

<lb />health of her uncle had hitherto prevented her seeing,
<lb />was yet no stranger to company; she had passed her
<lb />time in retirement, but not in obscurity, since for some
<lb />years past she had presided at the table of the Dean,
<lb />who was visited by the first people of the county in
<lb />which he lived:  and notwithstanding his parties,
<lb />which were frequent, though small, and elegant,
<lb />though private, had not prepared her for the splen&shy;
<lb />dour or the diversity of a London assembly, they yet,
<lb />by initiating her in the practical rules of good-breed&shy;
<lb />ing, had taught her to subdue the timid fears of total
<lb />inexperience, and to repress the bashful feelings of
<lb />shame-faced awkwardness; fears and feelings which
<lb />rather call for compassion than admiration, and
<lb />which, except in extreme youth, serve but to degrade
<lb />the modesty they indicate.</p>
<p><lb />She regarded, therefore, the two young ladies be&shy;
<lb />tween whom she was seated, rather with a wish of
<lb />addressing, than a shyness of being attacked by them;
	  <lb />but the elder, <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, was earnestly engaged
<lb />in a discourse with a gentleman, and the younger,
	  <lb /><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, totally discouraged her, by the invaria&shy;
<lb />ble silence and gravity with which from time to time
<lb />she met her eyes.</p>
<p><lb />Uninterrupted, therefore, except by occasional
	  <lb />speeches from <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, she spent the
<lb />first part of the evening merely in surveying the
<lb />company.</p>
<p><lb />Nor was the company dilatory in returning her no&shy;
<lb />tice, since from the time of her entrance into the
<lb />room, she had been the object of general regard.</p>
<p><lb />The ladies took an exact inventory of her dress,
<lb />and internally settled how differently they would have
<lb />been attired if blest with equal affluence.</p>

<lb />The men disputed amongst themselves whether or
<lb />not she was painted; and one of them asserting
<lb />boldly that she <emph>rouged well</emph>, a debate ensued, which
<lb />ended in a bet, and the decision was mutually agreed
<lb />to depend upon the colour of her cheeks by the begin&shy;
	  <lb />ning of <name>April</name>, when, if unfaded by bad hours and
<lb />continual dissipation, they wore the same bright
<lb />bloom with which they were now glowing, her cham&shy;
<lb />pion acknowledged that his wager would be lost.</p>
<p><lb />In about half an hour the gentleman with whom
	  <lb /><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> had been talking, left the room, and
	  <lb />then that young lady, turning suddenly to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, ex&shy;
	  <lb />claimed, <q>How odd <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> is!  Do you know
	    <lb />he says he shan't be well enough to go to <persName>Lady Ny&shy;

<lb />hurt him.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, surprised at an attack so little ceremonious,
<lb />lent her civil, but silent attention.</p>
<p><lb /><q>You shall be there, shan't you?</q> she added.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No, ma'am, I have not the honour of being at all
<lb />known to her ladyship.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q078" next="q079">O there's nothing in that,</q> returned she,  <q id="q079" prev="q078">for

<lb />rately, <q id="q083" prev="q082">don't you know what I mean?  Why a ticket
<lb />is only a visiting card, with a name upon it; but we
<lb />all call them tickets now.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked her for the information, and then
	  <lb /><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> enquired how many miles she had tra&shy;
<lb />velled since morning?</p>

<p><lb /><q id="q086" next="q087">O, you're vastly well,</q> returned the other, <q id="q087" prev="q086">and
<lb />for my part, I never think about dress.  But only con&shy;
<lb />ceive what happened to me last year!  Do you know
	    <lb />I came to town the <date value="--03-20">twentieth of <name>March</name></date>!  Was not

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q088" next="q089">Perhaps so,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q090" next="q091">Not tell why?</q> repeated <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q id="q091" prev="q090">why
<lb />don't you know it was the very night of the grand
	    <lb />masquerade at <persName>Lord Darien's</persName>?  I would not have
<lb />missed it for the whole universe.  I never travelled
<lb />in such an agony in my life:  we did not get to town
<lb />till monstrous late, and then do you know I had nei&shy;
<lb />ther a ticket nor a habit!  Only conceive what a
<lb />distress!  Well, I sent to every creature I knew for
<lb />a ticket, but they all said there was not one to be
<lb />had; so I was just like a mad creature&mdash;but about
<lb />ten or eleven o'clock, a young lady of my particular
<lb />acquaintance, by the greatest good luck in the world
<lb />happened to be taken suddenly ill; so she sent me
<lb />her ticket&mdash;was not that delightful?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>For <emph>her</emph>, extremely!</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, laughing.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q092" next="q093">Well,</q> she continued, <q id="q093" prev="q092">then I was almost out of
<lb />my wits with joy; and I went about and got one of the
<lb />sweetest dresses you ever saw.  If you'll call upon
<lb />me some morning, I'll shew it you.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, not prepared for an invitation so abrupt,
	  <lb />bowed without speaking, and <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, too
<lb />happy in talking herself to be offended at the silence
<lb />of another, continued her narration.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, but now comes the vilest part of the busi&shy;

<lb />ness; do you know when every thing else was ready,
<lb />I could not get my hair-dresser!  I sent all over the
<lb />town&mdash;he was no where to be found; I thought I
<lb />should have died with vexation; I assure you I cried
<lb />so, that if I had not gone in a mask, I should have
<lb />been ashamed to be seen.  And so, after all this mon&shy;
<lb />strous fatigue, I was forced to have my hair dressed
<lb />by my own maid, quite in a common way; was it not
<lb />cruelly mortifying?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q094" next="q095">Why yes,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q095" prev="q094">I should think it
<lb />was almost sufficient to make you regret the illness of
<lb />the young lady who sent you her ticket.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />They were now interrupted by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who
<lb />advanced to them, followed by a young man of a se&shy;
<lb />rious aspect and modest demeanour, and said, <q>I am
<lb />happy to see you both so well engaged; but my bro&shy;
<lb />ther has been reproaching me with presenting every
	    <lb />body to <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> but himself.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q096" next="q097">I cannot hope,</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, <q id="q097" prev="q096">that I have
	    <lb />any place in the recollection of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>; but
	    <lb />long as I have been absent from <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, and unfortu&shy;
<lb />nate as I was in not seeing her during my last visit
<lb />there, I am yet sure, even at this distance of time,
<lb />grown and formed as she is, I should instantly have
<lb />known her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q098" next="q099">Amazing!</q> cried an elderly gentleman, in a tone

<p>	  <lb /><q>Is that possible?</q> cried <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, with a look

<lb />disputes you were my advocate, in all plays, my com&shy;

<p><lb /><q id="q102" next="q103">Madam,</q> cried the same gentleman, <q id="q103" prev="q102">if you

<lb />come all three at once.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q104" next="q105">You are very good,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, laughing,

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q106" next="q107">That's pity,</q> he returned, <q id="q107" prev="q106">for <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> seems

<lb />with you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But for that purpose he must return to the days

<p><lb /><q id="q108" next="q109">Ah, would to Heaven it were possible!</q> cried
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, <q id="q109" prev="q108">for they were the happiest of my

<p><lb /><q id="q110" next="q111">After such a confession,</q> said his companion,
<lb /><q id="q111" prev="q110">surely you will let him attempt to renew them? 'tis
<lb />but taking a walk backwards; and though it is very
	    <lb />early in life for <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> to covet that retrograde
<lb />motion, which, in the regular course of things, we
<lb />shall all in our turns sigh for, yet with such a motive
	    <lb />as recovering <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> for a playfellow, who
<lb />can wonder that he anticipates in youth the hopeless
<lb />wishes of age?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />Here <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, who was one of that numerous
<lb />tribe of young ladies to whom all conversation is irk&shy;
<lb />some in which they are not themselves engaged,
	  <lb />quitted her place, of which <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, <persName>Cecilia's</persName>
<lb />new acquaintance, immediately took possession.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q112" next="q113">Is it utterly impossible,</q> continued this gentle&shy;

<lb />such a renovation?  Is there no subaltern part I

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q114" next="q115">I have no doubt, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q115" prev="q114">of
<lb />your accomplishments; and I should be not a little
<lb />entertained with the surprise of the company, if you
<lb />could persuade yourself to display them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q116" next="q117">And what,</q> cried he, <q id="q117" prev="q116" next="q118">could the company do half
<lb />so well as to arise also, and join in the sport? it
<lb />would but interrupt some tale of scandal, or some
<lb />description of a <foreign lang="fre">toupee.</foreign>  Active wit, however des&shy;
<lb />picable when compared with intellectual, is yet
<lb />surely better than the insignificant click-clack of
	    <lb />modish conversation,</q> casting his eyes towards <persName>Miss
<lb />Larolles</persName>, <q id="q118" prev="q117">or even the pensive dullness of affected
	    <lb />silence,</q> changing their direction towards <persName>Miss
<lb />Leeson</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though surprised at an attack upon the
<lb />society her friend had selected, by one who was ad&shy;
<lb />mitted to make a part of it, felt its justice too strongly
<lb />to be offended at its severity.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q119" next="q120">I have often wished,</q> he continued, <q id="q120" prev="q119">that when
<lb />large parties are collected, as here, without any pos&shy;
<lb />sible reason why they might not as well be separated,
<lb />something could be proposed in which each person
<lb />might innocently take a share:  for surely, after the
<lb />first half hour, they can find little new to observe in
<lb />the dress of their neighbours, or to display in their
<lb />own; and with whatever seeming gaiety they may
<lb />contrive to fill up the middle and end of the evening,
<lb />by wire-drawing the comments afforded by the begin&shy;
<lb />ning, they are yet so miserably fatigued, that if they
<pb n="037" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">35</mw>
<lb />have not four or five places to run every night,
<lb />they suffer nearly as much from weariness of their

<lb />of themselves in solitude.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here by the general breaking up of the party, the
	  <lb />conversation was interrupted, and <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> was
<lb />obliged to make his exit; not much to the regret of
	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was impatient to be alone with <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />The rest of the evening, therefore, was spent
<lb />much more to her satisfaction; it was devoted to
<lb />friendship, to mutual enquiries, to kind congratula&shy;
<lb />tions, and endearing recollections; and though it

<lb />hastened to the breakfast apartment.</p>
<p><lb />She had not, however, been more impatient to

<lb />in putting it in order.</p>
<p><lb />At ten o'clock she made another attempt:  the

<lb />still it was empty.  Again she was retiring, when

<p rend="indent(0)">
<lb />He expressed his surprise at her early rising, in a
<lb />manner that marked the pleasure it gave to him;
<lb />and then, returning to the conversation of the pre&shy;
<lb />ceding evening, he expatiated with warmth and feel&shy;
<lb />ing upon the happiness of his boyish days, remem&shy;
<lb />bered every circumstance belonging to the plays
<lb />in which they had formerly been companions, and
<lb />dwelt upon every incident with a minuteness of
<lb />delight that shewed his unwillingness ever to have
<lb />done with the subject.</p>
<p><lb />This discourse detained her till they were joined
	  <lb />by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and then another more gay and more
<lb />general succeeded to it.</p>
<p>	  <lb />During their breakfast, <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> was an&shy;
	  <lb />nounced as a visiter to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whom she imme&shy;

<lb />could no longer defer the honour of waiting upon
<lb />her.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, much amazed at this warmth of civility
<lb />from one whom she was almost a stranger, re&shy;
	  <lb />ceived her compliment rather coldly; but <persName>Miss La&shy;
<lb />rolles</persName>, without consulting her looks, or attending to
<lb />her manner, proceeded to express the earnest desire she
<lb />had long had to be known to her; to hope they should
<lb />meet very often; to declare nothing could make her

	    <lb /><placeName>Paris</placeName> in her disposal; the sweetest caps! the most

<lb />It is the most dangerous thing you can conceive to
<lb />gonear her; I never trust myself in her room but I
<lb />am sure to be ruined.  If you please, I will take
<lb />you to her this morning.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q123" next="q124">If her acqaintance is so ruinous,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q id="q124" prev="q123">I think I had better avoid it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O impossible! there's no such thing as living
<lb />without her.  To be sure she's shockingly dear, that
<lb />I must own; but then who can wonder?  She makes
<lb />such sweet things, 'tis impossible to pay her too
<lb />much for them.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> now joining in the recommendation,
	  <lb />the party was agreed upon, and accompanied by <persName>Mr.

<p>	  <lb />Here the raptures of <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> were again ex&shy;

<lb />sessors, heard their names with envy, and sighed
<lb />with all the bitterness of mortification that she was
<lb />unable to order home almost every thing she looked
<lb />at.</p>
<p><lb />Having finished their business here, they proceed&shy;
<lb />ed to various other dress manufacturers, in whose

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q127" next="q128">Is that so small a party?</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, smiling;
<lb /><q id="q128" prev="q127">and how short a time since would you, as well as I,
<lb />have reckoned it a large one!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q129" next="q130">O, you mean when I lived in the country,</q> re&shy;
	  <lb />turned <persName>Mrs. Harrell</persName>; <q id="q130" prev="q129">but what in the world could I
<lb />know of parties or company then?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q131" next="q132">Not much, indeed,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q132" prev="q131">as my pre&shy;
<lb />sent ignorance shews.</q></p>
<p><lb />They then parted to dress for dinner.</p>
<p><lb />The company of this evening were again all
	  <lb />strangers to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, except <persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, who was
<lb />seated next to her, and whose frigid looks again com&shy;
<lb />pelled her to observe the same silence she so reso&shy;
<lb />lutely practised herself.  Yet not the less was her
<lb />internal surprise, that a lady who seemed determined
<lb />neither to give nor receive any entertainment, should
<lb />repeatedly chuse to shew herself in a company, with
<lb />no part of which she associated.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who contrived to occupy the seat on her
<lb />other side, suffered not the silence with which her
<lb />fair neighbour had infected to spread any further:
<lb />he talked, indeed, upon no new subject; and upon
<lb />the old one, of their former sports and amusements,
<lb />he had already exhausted all that was worth being
<lb />mentioned; but not yet had he exhausted the plea&shy;
<lb />sure he received from the theme; it seemed always
<pb n="041" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">39</mw>
<lb />fresh, and always enchanting to him; it employed
<lb />his thoughts, regaled his imagination, and enlivened
	  <lb />his discourse.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> in vain tried to change it for
<lb />another; he quitted only by compulsion, and re&shy;
<lb />turned to it with redoubled eagerness.</p>
<p>	  <lb />When the company was retired, and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
	  <lb />only remained with the ladies, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with no little
	  <lb />surprise, enquired for <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, observing that she
<lb />had not seen him the whole day.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q133" next="q134">O,</q> cried his lady, <q id="q134" prev="q133">don't think of wondering at
<lb />that, for it happens continually.  He dines at home,
<lb />indeed, in general, but otherwise I should see no&shy;
<lb />thing of him at all.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed! why how does he fill up his time?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That I'm sure I cannot tell, for he never con&shy;
<lb />sults me about it; but I suppose much in the same
<lb />way that other people do.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q135" next="q136">Ah <persName>Priscilla</persName>!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with some earnest&shy;
<lb />ness, <q id="q136" prev="q135">how little did I ever expect to see you so
<lb />much a fine lady!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q137" next="q138">A fine lady!</q> repeated <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q138" prev="q137">why what
<lb />is it I do? don't I live exactly like every body else
<lb />that mixes at all with the world?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q139" next="q140">You, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> in a low
<lb />voice, <q id="q140" prev="q139">will I hope give to the world an example, not
<lb />take one from it.</q></p>
<p><lb />Soon after, they separated for the night.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The next morning, <persName>Cecilia</persName> took care to fill up her
<lb />time more advantageously than in wandering about the
<lb />house in search if a companion she now expected not
<lb />to find:  she got together her books, arranged them to
<lb />her fancy, and secured to herself, for the future occu&shy;
<lb />pation of her leisure hours, the exhaustless fund of
<pb n="042" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">40</mw>
<lb />entertainment which reading, that richest, highest,
<lb />and noblest source of intellectual enjoyment, perpe&shy;
<lb />tually affords.</p>
<p><lb />While they were yet at breakfast, they were again
	  <lb />visited by <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>.  <q id="q141" next="q142">I am come,</q> cried she
	  <lb />eagerly, <q id="q142" prev="q141">to run away with you both to my <persName>Lord
<lb />Belgrade's</persName> sale.  All the world will be there; and
<lb />we shall go in with tickets, and you have no notion
<lb />how it will be crowded.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>What is to be sold there?</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>O every thing you can conceive; house, stables,
<lb />china, laces, horses, caps, every thing in the world.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And do you intend to buy any thing?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord, no; but one likes to see the people's things.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then begged they would excuse her attend&shy;
<lb />ance.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q143" next="q144">O by no means,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q id="q144" prev="q143">you must
<lb />go, I assure you; there'll be such a monstrous crowd
<lb />as you never saw in your life.  I dare say we shall be
<lb />half squeezed to death.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q145" next="q146">That,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q146" prev="q145">is an inducement which
<lb />you must not expect will have much weight with a
<lb />poor rustic just out of the country:  it must require all
<lb />the polish of a long residence in the metropolis to
<lb />make it attractive.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O but do go, for I assure you it will be the best sale
	    <lb />we shall have this season.  I can't imagine, <persName>Mrs. Har&shy;
	      <lb />rel</persName>, what poor <persName>Lady Belgrade</persName> will do with herself; I
<lb />hear the creditors have seized every thing; I really
<lb />believe the creditors are the cruellest set of people in the
<lb />world!  They have taken those beautiful buckles out
<lb />of her shoes!  Poor soul!  I declare it will make my
<lb />heart ache to see them put up.  It's quite shocking,
<pb n="043" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">41</mw>
<lb />upon my word.  I wonder who'll buy them.  I assure
<lb />you they were the prettiest fancied I ever saw.  But
<lb />come, if you don't go directly, there will be no get&shy;
<lb />ting in.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> again desired to be excused accompanying
<lb />them, adding, that she wished to spend the day at
<lb />home.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q147" next="q148">At home, my dear?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q148" prev="q147">why
	    <lb />we have been engaged to <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> this month,
<lb />and she begged me to prevail with you to be of the
<lb />party.  I expect she'll call, or send you a ticket, every
<lb />moment.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q149" next="q150">How unlucky for me,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q150" prev="q149">that you
<lb />should happen to have so many engagements just at
<lb />this time!  I hope, at least, there will not be any for
<lb />to-morrow.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>O yes; to-morrow we go to <persName>Mrs. Elton's</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Again to-morrow? and how long is this to last?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O heavens knows; I'll shew you my catalogue.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then produced a book which contained a list of
<lb />engagements for more than three weeks.  <q id="q150a" next="q151">And as
<lb />these,</q> she said, <q id="q151" prev="q150a">are struck off, new ones are made;
<lb />and so it is we go on till after the birth-day.</q></p>
<p><lb />When this list had been examined and commented
	  <lb />upon by <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, and viewed and wondered at
	  <lb />by <persName>Cecilia</persName>, it was restored to its place, and the two
	  <lb />ladies went together to the auction, permitting <persName>Ceci&shy;
<lb />lia</persName>, at her repeated request, to return to her own
<lb />apartment.</p>
<p><lb />She returned, however, neither satisfied with the
<lb />behaviour of her friend, nor pleased with her own
<lb />situation:  the sobriety of her education, as it had
<lb />early instilled into her mind the pure dictates of
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">2.</mw>
<pb n="044" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">42</mw>
<lb />religion, and strict principles of honour, had also
<lb />taught her to regard continual dissipation as an intro&shy;
<lb />duction to vice, and unbounded extravagance as the
<lb />harbinger of injustice.  Long accustomed to see
	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> in the same retirement in which she had
<lb />hitherto lived herself, when books were their first
<lb />amusement, and the society of each other was their
<lb />chief happiness, the change she now perceived in
<lb />her mind and manners equally concerned and sur&shy;
<lb />prised her.  She found her insensible to friendship,
<lb />indifferent to her husband, and negligent of all social
<lb />felicity.  Dress, company, parties of pleasure, and
<lb />public places, seemed not merely to occupy all her
	  <lb />time, but to gratify all her wishes.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in whose
<lb />heart glowed the warmest affections and most gene&shy;
<lb />rous virtue, was cruelly depressed and mortified by
<lb />this disappointment; yet she had the good sense to
<lb />determine against upbraiding her, well aware that if
<lb />reproach has any power over indifference, it is only
<lb />that of changing it to aversion.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, in truth, was innocent of heart, though
<lb />dissipated in life; married very young, she had
<lb />made an immediate transition from living in a private
<lb />family and a country town, to becoming mistress of
	  <lb />one of the most elegant houses in <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>,
<lb />being at the head of a splendid fortune, and wife to a
<lb />man whose own pursuits soon shewed her the little
<lb />value he himself set upon domestic happiness.  Im&shy;
<lb />mersed in the fashionable round of company and di&shy;
<lb />versions, her understanding, naturally weak, was
<lb />easily dazzled by the brilliancy of her situation;
<lb />greedily, therefore, sucking in air impregnated with
<lb />luxury and extravagance, she had soon no plea&shy;
<pb n="045" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">43</mw>
<lb />sure but to vie with some rival in elegance, and no
<lb />ambition but to exceed some superior in expence.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The Dean of &mdash;&mdash;&mdash; in naming <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> for
<lb />one of the guardians of his niece, had no other
<lb />view than that of indulging her wishes by allowing
<lb />her to reside in the house of her friend:  he had little
<lb />personal knowledge of him, but was satisfied with
<lb />the nomination, because acquainted with his family,
<lb />fortune, and connections, all which persuaded him
<lb />to believe, without further enquiry, that it was more
<lb />peculiarly proper for his niece than any other he
<lb />could make.</p>
<p><lb />In his choice of the other two trustees he had
<lb />been more prudent; the first of these, the honour&shy;
	  <lb />able <persName>Mr. Delville</persName>, was a man of high birth and
	  <lb />character; the second, <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, had spent his
<lb />whole life in business, in which he had already
<lb />amassed an immense fortune, and had still no greater
<lb />pleasure than that of increasing it.  From the ho&shy;
	  <lb />nour, therefore, of <persName>Mr. Delville</persName>, he expected the
<lb />most scrupulous watchfulness that his niece should
<lb />in nothing be injured, and from the experience of
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> in money matters, and his diligence in
<lb />transacting business, he hoped for the most vigilant
<lb />observance that her fortune, while under his care,
<lb />should be turned to the best account.  And thus, as
<lb />far as he was able, he had equally consulted her plea&shy;
<lb />sure, her security, and her pecuniary advantage.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> returned home only in time to dress
<lb />for the rest of the day.</p>
<p>	  <lb />When <persName>Cecilia</persName> was summoned to dinner, she found,
<lb />besides her host and hostess, and Mr. Arnott, a gen&shy;
<lb />tleman she had not before seen, but who, as soon as
<pb n="046" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">44</mw>
	  <lb />she entered the parlour, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> presented to
<lb />her, saying at the same time he was one of the most
<lb />intimate of his friends.</p>
<p>	  <lb />This gentleman, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, was about
<lb />thirty years of age; his face was neither remarkable
<lb />for its beauty nor its ugliness, but sufficiently dis&shy;
<lb />tinguished by its expression of invincible assurance;
<lb />his person, too, though neither striking for its grace
<lb />nor its deformity, attracted notice from the insolence
<lb />of his deportment.  His manners, haughty and super&shy;
<lb />cilious, marked the high opinion he cherished of his
<lb />own importance; and his air and address, at once
<lb />bold and negligent, announced his happy perfection
<lb />in the character at which he aimed, that of an ac&shy;
<lb />complished man of the town.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The moment <persName>Cecilia</persName> appeared, she bacame the ob&shy;
<lb />ject of his attention, though neither with the look of
<lb />admiration due her beauty, nor yet with that of
<lb />curiosity excited by her novelty, but with the scruti&shy;
<lb />nizing observation of a man on the point of making
<lb />a bargain, who views with fault-seeking eyes the
<lb />property he means to cheapen.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, wholly unused to an examination so little
<lb />ceremonious, shrunk abashed from his regards:  but
<lb />his conversation was not less displeasing to her
<lb />than his looks; his principal subjects, which were
<lb />horse-racing, losses at play, and disputes at gaming
<lb />tables, could afford her but little amusement, because
<lb />she could not understand them; and the episodes
<lb />with which they were occasionally interspersed, con&shy;
<lb />sisting chiefly of comparitive strictures upon cele&shy;
<lb />brated beauties, hints of impending bankruptcies,
<lb />and witticisms upon recent divorces, were yet more

<lb />disagreeable to her, because more intelligible.
<lb />Wearied, therefore, with uninteresting anecdotes,
<lb />and offended with injudicious subjects of pleasantry,
<lb />she waited with impatience for the moment of retir&shy;
	  <lb />ing; but <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, less eager, because better en&shy;
<lb />tertained, was in no haste to remove, and therefore
<lb />she was compelled to remain quiet, till they were
<lb />both obliged to arise, in order to fulfill their engage&shy;
	  <lb />ment with <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />As they went together to the house of that lady,
	  <lb />in <persName>Mrs. Harrel's</persName> vis-a-vis, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, not doubting but
<lb />their opinions of the Baronet would accord,
<lb />instantly and openly declared her disapprobation of
	  <lb />every thing he had uttered; but <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, far
<lb />from confirming her expectations, only said, <q>I am
<lb />sorry you don't like him, for he is almost always with
<lb />us.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Do you like him, then, yourself?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Extremely; he is very entertaining and clever,
<lb />and knows the world.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q152" next="q153">How judiciously do you praise him!</q> cried

<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, satisfied to commend, without even
<lb />attempting to vindicate him, was soon content to
	  <lb />change the subject; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, though much con&shy;
<lb />cerned that the husband of her friend had made so
<lb />disgraceful an election of a favourite, yet hoped that
	  <lb />the lenity of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> resulted from her desire to
<lb />excuse his choice, not from her own approbation.</p></div>

<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> soon engaged herself at a card-table:
	  <lb />and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who declined playing, was seated next to
	  <lb /><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, who arose to return the curtsey she
<lb />made in advancing to her, but that past, did not even
<lb />look at her.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though fond of conversation and formed
<lb />for society, was too diffident to attempt speaking
<lb />where so little encouraged; they both, therefore,
	  <lb />continued silent, till <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,

<p>	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who had placed himself opposite to

<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> now joined another party; and <persName>Mr.

<lb />moved round to the back of her chair, where he pa&shy;
	  <lb />tiently stood for the rest of the evening.  But <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName> still kept his post, and still, without troubling
<lb />himself to speak, kept his eyes fixed upon the same
<lb />object.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, offended by his boldness, looked a thou&shy;
<lb />sand ways to avoid him; but her embarrassment, by
<lb />giving greater play to her features, served only to
<lb />keep awake an attention which might otherwise have
<lb />wearied.  She was almost tempted to move her chair
	  <lb />round and face <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, but though she wished to
<lb />shew her disapprobation of the Baronet, she had not
<lb />yet been reconciled by fashion to turning her back
<lb />upon the company at large, for the indulgence of con&shy;
<lb />versing with some particular person:  a fashion
<lb />which to unaccustomed observers seems rude and re&shy;
<lb />pulsive, but which, when once adopted, carries with
<lb />it imperceptibly its own recommendation, in the ease,
<lb />convenience, and freedom which it promotes.</p>
<pb n="052" />

<p>
<lb />Thus disagreeably stationed, she found but little
	  <lb />assistance from the neighbourhood of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb />since even his own desire of conversing with her, was
<lb />swallowed up by an anxious and involuntary impulse
	  <lb />to watch the looks and motions of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />At length, quite tired of sitting as if merely an ob&shy;
<lb />ject to be gazed at, she determined to attempt enter&shy;
	  <lb />ing into a conversation with <persName>Miss Leeson</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />The difficulty, however, was not inconsiderable
<lb />how to make the attack, she was unacquainted with
<lb />her friends and connections, uninformed of her way of
<lb />thinking, or her way of life, ignorant even of the
<lb />sound of her voice, and chilled by the coldness of her
<lb />aspect:  yet, having no other alternative, she was
<lb />more willing to encounter the forbidding looks of this
<lb />lady, than to continue silently abashed under the scru&shy;
	  <lb />tinizing eyes of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />After much deliberation with what subject to begin,
	  <lb />she remembered that <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> had been present
<lb />the first time they had met, and thought it probable
<lb />they might be acquainted with each other; and there&shy;
<lb />fore, bending forward, she ventured to enquire if she
<lb />had lately seen that young lady?</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, in a voice alike inexpressive of satis&shy;
<lb />faction or displeasure, quietly answered, <q>No,
<lb />ma'am.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, discouraged by this conciseness, was a
	  <lb />few minutes silent; but the perseverance of <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName> in staring at her, exciting her own in trying to
<lb />avoid his eyes, she exerted herself so far as to add,
	  <lb /><q>Does <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> expect <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> here this
<lb />evening?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, without raising her head, gravely re&shy;

<lb />All was now to be done over again, and a new sub&shy;
<lb />ject to be started, for she could suggest nothing
	  <lb />further to ask concerning <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> had seen little of life, but that little she had
<lb />well marked, and her observation had taught her,
<lb />that among fashionable people, public places seemed
<lb />a never-failing source of conversation and entertain&shy;
<lb />ment:  upon this topic, therefore, she hoped for
<lb />better success; and as to those who have spent more
	  <lb />time in the country than in <placeName>London</placeName>, no place of
<lb />amusement is so interesting as a theatre.  She opened
<lb />the subject she had so happily suggested, by an en&shy;
<lb />quiry whether any new play had lately come out?</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, with the same dryness, only answered,
<lb /><q>Indeed I can't tell.</q></p>
<p><lb />Another pause now followed, and the spirits of
	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> were considerable dampt; but happening ac&shy;
	  <lb />cidentaly to recollect the name of <persName>Almack</persName>, she
<lb />presently revived, and congratulating herself that
<lb />she should now be able to speak of a place too
<lb />fashionable for disdain, she asked her, in a manner
<lb />somewhat more assured, if she was a subscriber to
<lb />his assemblies?</p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, ma'am.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Do you go to them constantly?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, ma'am.</q></p>
<p><lb />Again they were both silent.  And now, tired of
<lb />finding the ill success of each particular enquiry,
<lb />she thought a more general one might obtain an an&shy;
<lb />swer less laconic, and therefore she begged she would
<lb />inform her <q>what was the most fashionable place of
<lb />diversion for the present season?</q></p>

<p>
	  <lb />This question, however, cost <persName>Miss Leeson</persName> no more
<lb />trouble than any which had preceded it, for she only
<lb />replied <q>Indeed I don't know.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now began to sicken of her attempt, and for
<lb />some minutes to give it up as hopeless; but after&shy;
<lb />wards, when she reflected how frivolous were the
<lb />questions she had asked, she felt more inclined to
<lb />pardon the answers she had received, and in a short
<lb />time to fancy she had mistaken contempt for stupidity,
	  <lb />and to grow less angry with <persName>Miss Leeson</persName> than
<lb />ashamed of herself.</p>
<p><lb />This supposition excited her to make yet another
<lb />trial of her talents for conversation; and there&shy;
<lb />fore, summoning up all the courage in her power, she
<lb />modestly apologized for the liberty she was taking,
<lb />and then begged her permission to enquire <q>whether
<lb />there was any thing new in the literary way that she
<lb />thought was worth recommending?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Miss Leeson</persName> now turned her eyes towards her, with
<lb />a look that implied a doubt whether she had heard
	  <lb />aright; and when the attentive attitude of <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />confirmed her question, surprise for a few instants
<lb />took place of insensibility, and with rather more
<lb />spirit than she had yet shown, she answered, <q>In&shy;
<lb />deed I know nothing of the matter.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was now utterly disconcerted; and half
<lb />angry with herself, and wholly provoked with her
<lb />sullen neighbour, she resolved to let nothing in fu&shy;
<lb />ture provoke her to a similar trial with so unpromis&shy;
<lb />ing a subject.</p>
<p><lb />She had not, however, much longer to endure the
	  <lb />examination of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who being pretty well
<lb />satisfied with staring, turned upon his heel, and was
<pb n="055" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">51</mw>
	  <lb />striding out of the room, when he was stopt by <persName>Mr.
<lb />Gosport</persName>, who for some time had been watching him.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> was a man of good parts, and keen
<lb />satire; minute in his observations, and ironical in his
<lb />expressions.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>So you don't play, <persName>Sir Robert</persName>?</q> he cried.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>What here?  No, I am going to <persName>Brooks's</persName>.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>But how do you like <persName>Harrel's</persName> Ward?  You have
<lb />taken a pretty good survey of her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why faith I don't know; but not much, I think;
<lb />she's a devilish fine woman too; but she has no spirit,
<lb />no life.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Did you try her?  Have you talked to her?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not I, truly!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nay, then, how do you mean to judge her?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, faith, that's all over now; one never thinks of
<lb />talking to the women by way of trying them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What other method, then, have you adopted?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post(&amp;rsquo;)">None.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>None?  Why then how do you go on?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why they talk to us.  The women take all that
<lb />trouble upon themselves now.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And pray how long may you have commenced <mcr>fade
<lb />macaroni?</mcr> for this is a part of your character with
<lb />which I was not acquainted.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, hang it, 'tis not from <mcr>ton</mcr>; no, it's merely from
<lb />laziness.  Who the d&mdash;&mdash;l will fatigue himslf with
<lb />dancing attendance upon the women, when keeping
<lb />them at a distance makes them dance attendance upon
<lb />us?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />Then, stalking from him to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, he took
<lb />him by the arm, and they left the room together.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> now advanced to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and ad&shy;

<lb />said, <q>I have been wishing to approach you for some
<lb />time, but the fear that you are already overpowered
<lb />by the loquacity of your fair neighbour, makes me
<lb />cautious of attempting to engage you.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q168" next="q169">You mean,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q169" prev="q168">to laugh at
<emph>my</emph> loqua&shy;
<lb />city, and indeed its ill success has rendered it suffi&shy;
<lb />ciently ridiculous.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q170" next="q171">Are you, then, yet to learn,</q> cried he, <q id="q171" prev="q170">that
<lb />there are certain young ladies who make it a rule
<lb />never to speak but to their own cronies?  Of this class
	    <lb />is <persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, and till you get into her particular
<lb />coterie, you must never expect to hear from her a word
<lb />of two syllables.  The <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">ton</emph> misses, as they are called,
<lb />who now infest the town, are in two divisions, the
<lb /><emph rend="case(smallcaps)">supercilious</emph>, and the <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">voluble</emph>.  The
<emph rend="case(smallcaps)">supercili&shy;
	      <lb />ous</emph> like <persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, are silent, scornful, languid, and
<lb />affected, and disdain all converse but with those of
	    <lb />their own set:  the <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">voluble</emph>, like <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, are
<lb />flirting, communicative, restless, and familiar, and
<lb />attack, without the smallest ceremony, every one they
<lb />think worthy their notice.  But this they have in
<lb />common, that at home they think of nothing but dress,
<lb />abroad, of nothing but admiration, and that every
<lb />where they hold in supreme contempt all but them&shy;
<lb />selves.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q172" next="q173">Probably, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q173" prev="q172">I have passed,
<lb />to-night, for one of the <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">volubles</emph>; however, all the
<lb />advantage has been with the <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">supercilious</emph>, for I have
<lb />suffered a total repulse.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Are you sure, however, you have not talked too
<lb />well for her?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, a child of five years' old ought to have been

<pb n="057" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">53</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>But it is not capacity alone you are to consult
<lb />when you talk with misses of the <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">ton</emph>; were their
<lb />understandings only to be considered, they would in&shy;
<lb />deed be wonderfully easy of access! in order, there&shy;
<lb />fore, to render their commerce somewhat difficult,
<lb />they will only be pleased by an observance of their
<lb />humours; which are ever most various and most exu&shy;
<lb />berant where the intellects are weakest and least
<lb />cultivated.  I have, however, a receipt which I have
<lb />found infallible for engaging the attention of young
<lb />ladies, of whatsoever character or denomination.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q174" next="q175">O, then,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q175" prev="q174">pray favour me with it,
<lb />for I have here an admirable opportunity to try its
<lb />efficacy.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q176" next="q177">I will give it you,</q> he answered, <q id="q177" prev="q176">with full di&shy;
<lb />rections.  When you meet with a young lady who
<lb />seems resolutely determined not to speak, or who, if
<lb />compelled by a direct question to make some answer,
<lb />drily gives a brief affirmative, or coldly a laconic
<lb />negative&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>A case in point!</q> interrupted <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q178" next="q179">Well, thus circumstanced,</q> he continued, <q id="q179" prev="q178">the
<lb />remedy I have to propose consists of three topics of
<lb />discourse.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pray what are they?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Dress, public places, and love.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, half surprised and half diverted, waited a
<lb />fuller explanation without giving any interruption.</p>
<p><lb /><q>These three topics,</q> he continued, <q>are to answer
<lb />three purposes, since there are no less than three
<lb />causes from which the silence of young ladies may
<lb />proceed:  sorrow, affectation, and stupidity.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Do you then,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>give nothing at
<lb />all to modesty?</q></p>
<pb n="058" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">54</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q id="q180" next="q181">I give much to it,</q> he answered, <q id="q181" prev="q180">as an excuse,
<lb />nay almost as an equivalent for wit; but for that sullen
<lb />silence which resists all encouragement, modesty is a
<lb />mere pretence, not a cause.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You must, however, be somewhat more explicit,
<lb />if you mean that I should benefit from your instruc&shy;
<lb />tions.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q182" next="q183">Well then,</q> he answered, <q id="q183" prev="q182">I will briefly enume&shy;
<lb />rate the three causes, with directions for the three me&shy;
<lb />thods of cure.  To begin with sorrow.  The tacitur&shy;
<lb />nity which really results from that is attended with
<lb />an incurable absence of mind, and a total unconsciousness
<lb />of the observation which it excites; upon this occasion,
<lb />public places may sometimes be tried in vain, and
<lb />even dress may fail; but love&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q184" next="q185">Are you sure, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with a laugh,
<lb /><q id="q185" prev="q184">that sorrow has but that one source?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q186" next="q187">By no means,</q> answered he, <q id="q187" prev="q186">for perhaps papa
<lb />may have been angry, or mamma may have been cross;
<lb />a milliner may have sent the wrong pompoon, or a <foreign lang="fre">cha&shy;
<lb />peron</foreign> to an assembly may have been taken ill &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Bitter subjects of affliction, indeed!  And are these
<lb />all you allow us?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nay, I speak but of young ladies of fashion, and
<lb />what of greater importance can befal them?  If there&shy;
<lb />fore, the grief of the fair patient proceeds from papa,
<lb />mamma, or the <foreign lang="fre">chaperon,</foreign> then the mention of public
<lb />places, those endless incentives of displeasure between
<lb />the old and the young, will draw forth her complaints,
<lb />and her complaints will bring their own cure, for those
<lb />who lament find speedy consolation:  if the milliner
<lb />has occasioned the calamity, the discussion of the dress
<lb />will have the same effect; should both these medicines
<pb n="059" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">55</mw>
<lb />fail, love, as I said before, will be found infallible,
<lb />for you will then have investigated every subject of
<lb />uneasiness which a youthful female in high life can
<lb />experience.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q188" next="q189">They are greatly obliged to you,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />bowing, <q id="q189" prev="q188">for granting them motives of sorrow so
<lb />honourable, and I thank you in the name of the whole
<lb />sex.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q190" next="q191">You, madam,</q> said he, returning her bow, <q id="q191" prev="q190">are
<lb />I hope an exception in the happiest way, that of
<lb />having no sorrow at all.  I come, now, to the silence
<lb />of affectation, which is presently discernable by the
<lb />roving of the eye round the room to see if it is heeded,
<lb />by the sedulous care to avoid an accidental smile, and
<lb />by the variety of disconsolate attitudes exhibited to the
<lb />beholders.  This species of silence has almost without
<lb />exception its origin in that babyish vanity which is
<lb />always gratified by exciting attention, without ever
<lb />perceiving that it provokes contempt.  In these cases,
<lb />as nature, is wholly out of the question, and the mind
<lb />is guarded against its own feelings, dress and public
<lb />places are almost certain of failing, but here again
<lb />love is sure to vanquish; as soon as it is named, at&shy;
<lb />tention becomes involuntary, and in a short time a
<lb />struggling simper discomposes the arrangement of the
<lb />features, and then the business is presently over, for
<lb />the young lady is either supporting some system, or
<lb />opposing some proposition, before she is well aware
<lb />that she has been cheated out of her sad silence at
<lb />all.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q192" next="q193">So much,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<q id="q193" prev="q192">for sorrow and for af&shy;
<lb />fectation.  Proceed next to stupidity; for that, in all
<lb />probability, I shall most frequently encounter.</q></p>

<p>
<lb /><q id="q194" next="q195">That must always be heavy work,</q> returned he,
<lb /><q id="q195" prev="q194">yet the road is plain, though it is all up-hill.  Love,
<lb />here, may be talked of without exciting any emotion,
<lb />or provoking any reply, and dress may be dilated upon
<lb />without producing any other effect than that of at&shy;
<lb />tracting a vacant stare; but public places are indubi&shy;
<lb />tably certain of success.  Dull and heavy characters,
<lb />incapable of animating from wit or from reason, be&shy;
<lb />cause unable to keep pace with them, and void of all
<lb />internal sources of entertainment, require the stimu&shy;
<lb />lation of show, glare, noise, and bustle, to interest or
<lb />awaken them.  Talk to them of such subjects, and
<lb />they adore you; no matter whether you paint to them
<lb />joy or horror, let there be but action, and they are
<lb />content; a battle has charms for them equal to a coro&shy;
<lb />nation, and a funeral amuses them as much as a
<lb />wedding.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q196" next="q197">I am much obliged to you,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, smiling,
<lb /><q id="q197" prev="q196">for these instructions; yet I must confess I know
<lb />not how upon the present occasion to make use of
<lb />them; public places I have already tried, but tried in
<lb />vain; dress I dare not mention, as I have not yet
<lb />learned its technical terms &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q198" next="q199">Well but,</q> interrupted he, <q id="q199" prev="q198">be not desperate:
<lb />you have yet the third topic unessayed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q200" next="q201">O that,</q> returned she, laughing, <q id="q201" prev="q200">I leave to
<lb />you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q202" next="q203">Pardon me,</q> cried he, <q id="q203" prev="q202">love is a source of loqua&shy;
<lb />city only with yourselves:  when it is started by men,
<lb />young ladies dwindle into mere listeners.  <emph>Simpering</emph>

	  <lb />of Miss Larolles, who tripping towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>, ex&shy;
<lb />claimed, <q>Lord, how glad I am to see you!  So you

<lb />digious loss, I assure you.  All the wardrobe was sold,
	    <lb />and all <persName>Lady Belgrade's</persName> trinkets.  I never saw such
<lb />a collection of sweet things in my life.  I was ready
<lb />to cry that I could not bid for half a hundred of them.
<lb />I declare I was kept in an agony the whole morning.
<lb />I would not but have been there for the world.
<lb />Poor Lady Belgrade! you really can't conceive
<lb />how I was shocked for her.  All her beautiful
<lb />things sold for almost nothing.  I assure you if you

<lb />But do you know, I have met with the most pro&shy;

<p><lb /><q>Why I'll tell you what it was, and then you shall
<lb />judge if it was not quite past endurance.  You must
<lb />know, I commisioned a particular friend of mine,
	    <lb /><persName>Miss Moffat</persName>, to buy me a trimming when she went
	    <lb />to <placeName>Paris;</placeName> well, she sent it me over about a month
	    <lb />ago by <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, and it's the sweetest thing
<lb />you ever saw in your life; but I would not make it
<lb />up, because there was not a creature in town, so
<lb />I thought to bring it out quite new in about a

	    <lb />Christmas.  Well, to-night at <persName>Lady Jane Dranet's</persName>
	    <lb />who should I meet but <persName>Miss Moffat</persName>!  She had
<lb />been in town some days, but so monstrously engaged,
<lb />I could never find her at home.  Well, I was quite
<lb />delighted to see her, for you must know she's a pro&shy;
<lb />digious favourite with me; so I ran up to her in a
<lb />great hurry to shake hands, and what do you think
<lb />was the first thing that struck my eyes?  Why just
<lb />such a trimming as my own, upon a nasty odious
<lb />gown, and half dirty!  Can you conceive any thing so

<p><lb /><q>O lord, but it's making it seem quite an old

<lb />think any thing was ever half so mortifying.  It dis&shy;

<lb />had stayed a month or two longer I should not have
<lb />minded it, but it was the cruellest thing in the world
<lb />to come over just now.  I wish the Custom-house

<p><lb /><q id="q216" next="q217">The composition would still be a sorry one,</q> an&shy;

<lb />heaviness which leaves to others the whole weight of
<lb />discourse, and whole search of entertainment, is the
<lb />most fatiguing, but, upon longer intimacy, even that
<lb />is less irksome and offensive, than the flippancy
<lb />which hears nothing but itself.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> arose now to depart, and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, not

 <head rend="slant(italic)">A Breakfast.</head>
<p>
	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> next morning, during breakfast, a servant ac&shy;
	  <lb />quainted <persName>Cecilia</persName> that a young gentleman was in the
<lb />hall, who begged to speak to her.  She desired he
	  <lb />might be admitted; and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, laughing, asked
	  <lb />if she ought not to quit the room; while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb />with even more than his usual gravity, directed his
<lb />eye towards the door to watch who should enter.</p>
<p><lb />Neither of them, however, received any satisfaction
<lb />when it was opened, for the gentleman who made his
<lb />appearance was unknown to both:  but great was the
	  <lb />amazement of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, though little her emotion,
	  <lb />when she saw <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>!</p>
<p><lb />He came forward with an air of the most pro&shy;
<lb />found respect for the company in general, and ob&shy;
	  <lb />sequiously advancing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, made an earnest
<lb />enquiry into her health after her journey, and hoped
<lb />she had heard good news from her friends in the
<lb />country.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, naturally concluding both from his
<lb />visit and behaviour, that he was an acquaintance of
<lb />some intimacy, very civilly offered him a seat and
<lb />some breakfast, which, very frankly, he accepted.
	  <lb />But <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who already felt the anxiety of a
<pb n="065" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="H3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">61</mw>
<lb />rising passion which was too full of veneration to be
<lb />sanguine, looked at him with uneasiness, and waited
<lb />his departure with impatience.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> began to imagine he had been commis&shy;
	  <lb />sioned to call upon her with some message from <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>:  for she knew not how to suppose that
<lb />merely and accidentally having spent an hour or two
<lb />in the same room with her, would authorize a visiting
	  <lb />acquaintance.  <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, however, had a facility
<lb />the most happy of reconciling his pretensions to his
<lb />inclination; and therefore she soon found that the
<lb />apology she had suggested appeared to him unneces&shy;
<lb />sary.  To lead, however, to the subject from which
<lb />she expected his excuse, she enquired how long he
	  <lb />had left <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>?</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q218" next="q219">But yesterday noon ma'am,</q> he answered, <q id="q219" prev="q218">or
<lb />I should certainly have taken the liberty to wait upon
<lb />you before.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had only been perplexing herself to
<lb />devise some reason why he came at all, now looked
<lb />at him with a grave surprise, which would totally
<lb />have abashed a man whose courage had been less, or
	  <lb />whose expectations had been greater; but <persName>Mr. Mor&shy;
<lb />rice</persName>, though he hazarded every danger upon the
<lb />slightest chance of hope, knew too well the weakness
<lb />of his claims to be confident of success, and had been
<lb />too familiar with rebuffs to be much hurt by receiv&shy;
<lb />ing them.  He might possibly have something to
<lb />gain, but he knew he had nothing to lose.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q220" next="q221">I had the pleasure,</q> he continued, <q id="q221" prev="q220">to leave
	    <lb />all our friends well, except poor <persName>Lady Margaret</persName>, and
<lb />she has had an attack of the asthma; yet she would

<lb />fain have persuaded her:  however, I believe the old
<lb />lady knows better things.</q>  And he looked archly at
	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>:  but perceiving that the insinuation gave her
<lb />nothing but disgust, he changed his tone, and added,
<lb /><q>It is amazing how well they live together; nobody
<lb />would imagine the disparity in their years.  Poor old
	    <lb />lady!  <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> will really have a great loss of
<lb />her when she dies.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q222" next="q223">A loss of her!</q> repeated <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q223" prev="q222">I am
<lb />sure she is an exceeding ill-natured old woman.
<lb />When I lived at Bury, I was always frightened out

<p><lb /><q id="q228" next="q229">Why indeed, ma'am, as you say,</q> answered

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q230" next="q231"><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely pro&shy;

<lb />wit, so much politeness!  I don't know a more charm&shy;
	    <lb />ing man any where than my friend <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now perceiving that her opinions of her
<lb />new acquaintance were as pliant as his bows, deter&shy;
<lb />mined to pay him no further attention, and hope by
<lb />sitting silent to force from him the business of his
<lb />visit, if any he had, or if, as she now suspected he
<lb />had none, to weary him into a retreat.</p>
<p><lb />But this plan, though it would have succeeded with
	  <lb />herself, failed with <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, who to a stock of
<lb />good-humour that made him always ready to oblige
<lb />others, added an equal portion of insensibility that
<lb />hardened him against all indignity.  Finding, there&shy;
	  <lb />fore, that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, to to whom his visit was intended,
<lb />seemed already satisfied with its length, he prudently
<lb />forbore to torment her; but perceiving that the
<lb />lady of the house was more accessible, he quickly
<lb />made a transfer of his attention, and addressed his
<lb />discourse to her with as much pleasure as if his only
<lb />view had been to see her, and as much ease as if he
<lb />had known her all his life.</p>
<p>	  <lb />With <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> this conduct was not injudicious;
<lb />she was pleased with his assiduity, amused with his
<lb />vivacity, and sufficiently satisfied with his understand&shy;
<lb />ing.  They conversed, therefore, upon pretty equal
<lb />terms, and neither of them were yet tired, when they
	  <lb />were interrupted by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who came into the

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q234" next="q235">No,</q> answered <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q id="q235" prev="q234">nothing at all.</q></p>

	  <lb /><q>Why, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>; I observed he never

<p><lb /><q id="q252" next="q253">His stay, however, was too short,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,

<p><lb /><q id="q254" next="q255">But perhaps,</q> cried <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q id="q255" prev="q254">it was long

<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> could not forbear laughing to hear the

<p><lb /><q id="q256" next="q257">My finding fault with him, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,

<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, animating at this speech, glided behind

<p><lb /><q>Then I'll tell you what's the matter with him in

<p>	  <lb /><q>What time did you get off last night, <persName>Harrel</persName>?</q>
	  <lb />said <persName>Sir Robert</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q260" next="q261">Not very early; but you were too much engaged

<p><lb /><q>I can't tell, indeed, but I know what I gained:  I
<lb />have not had such a run of luck this winter.</q></p>
<p><lb />They then went up to a window to carry on their

<p><lb />At the words <emph rend="slant(italic)">what do you think I lost</emph>, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, half

<lb />but perceived not the east change in her counte&shy;

<p><lb /><persName>Morrice</persName> now returning, called out, <q>He's had a

<p><lb />The matter, was now settled in a few minutes, and
<lb />having received his directions, and an invitation to
<lb />dinner, <persName>Morrice</persName> danced off, with a heart yet lighter
<lb />than his heels.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q266" next="q267">Why, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<q id="q267" prev="q266">this

<lb />dinner.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q268" next="q269">Remember, however,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was in&shy;
<lb />voluntarily diverted at the successful officiousness of
<lb />her new acquaintance, <q id="q269" prev="q268">that if you receive him
<lb />henceforth as your guest, he obtains admission through
<lb />his own merits, and not through my interest.</q></p>
<p><lb />At dinner, <persName>Morrice</persName>, who failed not to accept the
<lb />invitation of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, was the gayest, and indeed
<lb />the happiest man in the company:  the effort he had
<lb />made to fasten himself upon <persName>Cecilia</persName> as an acqaint&shy;
<lb />ance, had not, it is true, from herself met with much
<lb />encouragement; but he knew the chances were
<lb />against him when he made the trial, and therefore
<lb />the prospect of gaining admission into such a house
<lb />as <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s was not only sufficient to make
<lb />amends for what scarcely amounted to a disappoint&shy;
<lb />ment, but a subject of serious comfort from the credit
<lb />of the connection, and of internal exultation at his
<lb />own management and address.</p>
<p><lb />In the evening, the ladies, as usual, went to a
<lb />private assembly, and, as usual, were attended to it

<p>
	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Several</hi> days passed on nearly in the same manner;
<lb />the mornings were all spent in gossipping, shopping,
<lb />and dressing, and the evenings were regularly appro&shy;
<lb />priated to public places, or large parties of company.</p>
<p><lb />Meanwhile <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> lived almost entirely in
	  <lb /><placeName>Portman-square;</placeName> he slept, indeed, at his own lodg&shy;
<lb />ings, but he boarded wholly with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, whose
<lb />house he never for a moment quitted till night, except
<lb />to attend <persName>Cecilia</persName> and his sister in their visitings and
<lb />rambles.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was a young man of unexceptionable
<lb />character, and of a disposition mild, serious, and be&shy;
<lb />nignant:  his principles and blameless conduct ob&shy;
<lb />tained the universal esteem of the world, but his
<lb />manners, which were rather too precise, joined to an
<lb />uncommon gravity of countenance and demeanor,
<lb />made his society rather permitted as a duty,
<lb />than sought as a pleasure.</p>
<p><lb />The charms of <persName>Cecilia</persName> had forcibly, suddenly, and
<lb />deeply penetrated his heart; he only lived in her
<lb />presence, away from her he hardly existed:  the
<lb />emotions she excited were rather those of adoration
<pb n="073" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">69</mw>
<lb />than of love, for he gazed upon her beauty till he
<lb />thought her more than human, and hung upon her
<lb />accents till all speech seemed impertinent to him but
<lb />her own.  Yet so small were his expectations of suc&shy;
<lb />cess, that not even to his sister did he hint at the
<lb />situation of his heart:  happy in an easy access to
<lb />her, he contented himself with seeing, hearing,
<lb />and watching her, beyond which bounds he formed
<lb />not any plan, and scarce indulged any hope.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, too, was a frequent visiter in
	  <lb /><placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, where he dined almost daily.
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was chagrined at seeing so much of him, and
<lb />provoked to find herself almost constantly the object
<lb />of his unrestrained examination; she was, however,
<lb />far more seriously concerned for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, when
<lb />she discovered that this favourite friend of her hus&shy;
<lb />band was an unprincipled spendthrift, and an extra&shy;
<lb />vagant gamester:  for as he was the inseparable com&shy;
<lb />panion of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, she dreaded the consequence
<lb />both of his influence and his example.</p>
<p><lb />She saw, too, with an amazement that daily in&shy;
<lb />creased, the fatigue, yet fascination of a life of plea&shy;
<lb />sure:  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seemed to consider his own house
<lb />merely as an Hotel, where at any hour of the night he
<lb />might disturb the family to claim admittance, where
<lb />letters and messages might be left for him, where he
<lb />dined when no other dinner was offered him, and
<lb />where, when he made an appointment, he was to be
<lb />met with.  His lady, too, though more at home,
<lb />was not therefore more solitary; her acquaintance
<lb />were numerous, expensive and idle, and every mo&shy;

<p><lb />In a short time <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who every day had hoped
<lb />that the next would afford her greater satisfaction,
<lb />but who every day found the present no better than
<lb />the former, began to grow weary of eternally run&shy;
<lb />ning the same round, and to sicken at the irksome
<lb />repetition of unremitting yet uninteresting dissi&shy;
<lb />pation.  She saw nobody she wished to see, as she
<lb />had met with nobody for whom she could care; for
<lb />though sometimes those with whom she mixed ap&shy;
<lb />peared to be amiable, she knew that their manners,
<lb />like their persons, were in their best array, and
<lb />therefore she had too much understanding to judge
<lb />decisively of their characters.  But what chiefly
<lb />damped her hopes of forming a friendship with any
<lb />of the new acquaintance to whom she was introduced,
<lb />was the observation she herself made, how ill the
<lb />coldness of their hearts accorded with the warmth of
<lb />their professions:  upon every first meeting, the civi&shy;
<lb />lities which were shown her, flattered her into be&shy;
<lb />lieving she had excited a partiality that a very
<lb />little time would ripen into affection; the next meet&shy;
<lb />ing commonly confirmed the expectation; but the
<lb />third, and every future one, regularly destroyed it.
<lb />She found that time added nothing to their fondness,
<lb />nor intimacy to their sincerity; that the interest in
<lb />her welfare which appeared to be taken at first sight,
<lb />seldom, with whatever reason, increased, and often
<lb />without any, abated; that the distinction she at first
<lb />met with, was no effusion of kindness, but of cu&shy;
<lb />riosity, which is scarcely sooner gratified than sati
<lb />ated; and that those who lived always the life into
<lb />which she had only lately been initiated, were as
<lb />much harassed with it as herself, though less
<pb n="075" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">71</mw>
<lb />spirited to relenquish, and more helpless to better it;
<lb />and that they coveted nothing but what was new,
<lb />because they had experienced the insufficiency of
<lb />whatever was familiar.</p>
<p><lb />She began now to regret the loss she sustained in
<lb />quitting the neighbourhood, and being deprived of the
<lb />conversation of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, and yet more
<lb />earnestly to miss the affection and sigh for the so&shy;
	  <lb />ciety of <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, the lady with whom she had
<lb />long and happily resided at Bury; for she was very
<lb />soon compelled to give up all expectation of renew&shy;
<lb />ing the felicity of her earlier years, by being restored
<lb />to the friendship of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, in whom she had
<lb />mistaken the kindness of childish intimacy for the
<lb />sincerity of chosen affection; and though she saw her
<lb />credulous error with mortificaiton and displeasure,
<lb />she regretted it with tenderness and sorrow.  <q id="q270" next="q271">What,
<lb />at last,</q> cried she, <q id="q271" prev="q270">is human felicity, who has
<lb />tasted, and where is it to be found?  If I, who, to
<lb />others, seem marked out for even a partial possession
<lb />of it,--distinguished by fortune, caressed by the
<lb />world, brought into the circle of high life, and sur&shy;
<lb />rounded with splendour, seek without finding, yet
<lb />losing, scarce know how I miss it!</q></p>
<p><lb />Ashamed upon reflection to believe she was con&shy;
<lb />sidered as an object of envy by others, while repin&shy;
<lb />ing and discontented herself, she determined no
<lb />longer to be the only one insensible to the blessings
<lb />within her reach, but by projecting and adopting
<lb />some plan of conduct, better suited to her taste and
<lb />feelings than the frivolous insipidity of her present
<lb />life, to make at once a more spirited and more worthy
<lb />use of the affluence, freedom and power which she
<lb />possessed.</p>
<pb n="076" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">72</mw>
<p>
<lb />A scheme of happiness at once rational and refined
<lb />soon presented itself to her imagination.  She pur&shy;
<lb />posed, for the basis of her plan, to become mistress
<lb />of her own time, and with this view, to drop all idle
<lb />and uninteresting acquaintance, who while they con&shy;
<lb />tribute neither to use nor pleasure, make so large a
<lb />part of the community, that they may properly be cal&shy;
<lb />led the underminers of existence:  she could then
<lb />show some taste and discernment in her choice of
<lb />friends, and she resolved to select such only as by
<lb />their piety could elevate her mind, by their know&shy;
<lb />ledge improve her understanding, or by their accom&shy;
<lb />plishments and manners delight her affections.  This
<lb />regulation, if strictly adhered to, would soon relieve
<lb />her from the fatigue of receiving many visiters,
<lb />and therefore she might have all the leisure she could
<lb />desire for the pursuit of her favouite studies, music
<lb />and reading.</p>
<p><lb />Having thus, from her own estimation of human
<lb />perfection, culled whatever was noblest for her so&shy;
<lb />ciety, and from her own ideas of sedentary enjoy&shy;
<lb />ments, arranged the occupations of her hours of soli&shy;
<lb />tude, she felt fully satisfied with the portion of hap&shy;
<lb />piness which her scheme promised to herself, and
<lb />began next to consider what was due from her to the
<lb />world.</p>
<p><lb />And not without trembling did she then look for&shy;
<lb />ward to the claims which the splendid income she was
<lb />soon to possess would call upon her to discharge.  A
<lb />strong sense of <mcr rend="slant(smallcaps)">duty</mcr>, a fervent desire to <mcr rend="case(smallcaps)">act right</mcr>,
<lb />were the ruling characteristics of her mind:  her af&shy;
<lb />fluence she therefore considered as a debt contracted
<lb />with the poor; and her independence, as a tie upon
<lb />her liberality to pay it with interest.</p>
<pb n="077" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">73</mw>
<p>
<lb />Many and various, then, soothing to her spirit and
<lb />grateful to her sensibility, were the scenes which her
<lb />fancy delineated; now she supported an orphan, now
<lb />softened the sorrows of a widow, now snatched from
<lb />iniquity the feeble trembler at poverty, and now res&shy;
<lb />cued from shame the proud struggler with disgrace.
<lb />The prospect at once exalted her hopes, and enrap&shy;
<lb />tured her imagination; she regarded herself as an
<lb />agent of Charity, and already in idea anticipated the
<lb />rewards of a good and faithful delegate:  so animat&shy;
<lb />ing are the designs of disinterested benovolence! so
<lb />pure is the bliss of intellectual philanthropy!</p>
<p><lb />Not immediately, however, could this plan be put
<lb />in execution; the society she meant to form could not
<lb />be selected in the house of another, where, though to
<lb />some she might show a preference, there were none
<lb />she could reject:  nor had she yet the power to in&shy;
<lb />dulge, according to the munificence of her wishes, the
<lb />extensive generosity she projected:  these purposes
<lb />demanded a house of her own, and the unlimited
<lb />disposal of her fortune, neither of which she could
<lb />claim till she became of age.  That period, however,
<lb />was only eight months distant, and she pleased
<lb />herself with the intention of meliorating her
<lb />plan in the mean time, and preparing to put it in
<lb />practice.</p>
<p><lb />But though, in common with all the race of still&shy;
<lb />expecting man, she looked for that happiness in the
<lb />time to come which the present failed to afford, she
<lb />had yet the spirit and good sense to determine upon
<lb />making every effort in her power, to render her im&shy;
<lb />mediate way of life more useful and contented.</p>
<p><lb />Her first wish therefore, now, was to quit the house

<lb />of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, where she neither met with entertain&shy;
<lb />ment nor instruction, but was perpetually mortified
<lb />by seeing the total indifference of the friend in whose
<lb />society she had hoped for nothing but affection.</p>
<p><lb />The will of her uncle, though it obliged her while
<lb />under-age to live with one of her guardians, left her
<lb />at liberty to chuse and to change amongst them ac&shy;
<lb />cording to her wishes or convenience:  she deter&shy;
<lb />mined, therefore, to make a visit herself to each of
<lb />them, to observe their manners and way of life, and
<lb />then, to the best of her judgement, decide with which
<lb />she could be most contented:  resolving, however, not
<lb />to hint at her intention till it was ripe for execution,
<lb />and then honestly to confess the reasons of her re&shy;
<lb />treat.</p>
<p><lb />She had acquainted them both of her journey to
<lb />town the morning of her arrival.  She was almost
<lb />an entire stranger to each of them, as she had not
	  <lb />seen <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> since she was nine years old, nor
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Delville</persName> within the time she could remember.</p>
<p><lb />The very morning that she had settled her pro&shy;
<lb />ceedings for the arrangement of this new plan, she
<lb />intended to request the use of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s carriage,
<lb />and to make, without delay, the visits preparatory to
<lb />her removal:  but when she entered the parlour upon
<lb />a summons to breakfast, her eagerness to quit the
<lb />house gave way, for present, to the pleasure she
<lb />felt at the sight of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who was just ar&shy;
	  <lb />rived from <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />She expressed her satisfaction in the most lively
<lb />terms, and scrupled not to tell him she had not once
<lb />been so pleased since her journey to town, ex&shy;
<lb />cept at her first meeting with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.</p>
<pb n="079" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">75</mw>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, whose delight was infinitely su&shy;
<lb />perior to her own, and whose joy in seeing her was
<lb />redoubled by the affectionate frankness of her recep&shy;
<lb />tion, stifled the emotions to which her sight gave rise,
<lb />and denying himself the solace of expressing his
<lb />feelings, seemed much less charmed than herself at
<lb />the meeting, and suffered no word nor look to escape
<lb />him, beyond what could be authorized by friendly
<lb />civility.</p>
<p><lb />He then renewed with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> an acquaint&shy;
<lb />ance which had been formed before her marriage, but
<lb />which he had dropt when her distance from <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />upon whose account alone he had thought it worth
<lb />cultivation, made it no longer of use to him.  She
<lb />afterwards introduced her brother to him; and a con&shy;
<lb />versation very interesting to both the ladies took
<lb />place, concerning several families with which they
<lb />had been formerly connected, as well as the neigh&shy;
<lb />bourhood at large in which they had lately dwelt.</p>
<p><lb />Very little was the share taken by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> in
<lb />these accounts and enquiries; the unaffected joy with
<lb />which <persName>Cecilia</persName> had received <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, had struck
<lb />him with a sensation of envy as involuntary as it was
<lb />painful:  he did not, indeed, suspect that gentleman's
<lb />secret views; no reason for suspicion was obvious,
<lb />and his penetration sunk not deeper than appear&shy;
<lb />ances; he knew, too, that he was married, and there&shy;
<lb />fore no jealousy occurred to him; but still she had
<lb />smiled upon him!&mdash;&mdash;and he felt that to purchase
<lb />for himself a smile of so much sweetness, he would
<lb />have sacrificed almost all else that was valuable to
<lb />him upon earth.</p>
<p>	  <lb />With an attention infinitely more accurate, <persName>Mr.
<pb n="080" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">76</mw>
<lb />Monckton</persName> had returned his observations.  The un&shy;
<lb />easiness of his mind was apparent, and the anxious
<lb />watchfulness of his eye plainly manifested whence it
<lb />arose.  From a situation, indeed, which permitted an
<lb />intercourse the most constant and unrestrained with
<lb />such an object as <persName>Cecilia</persName>, nothing less could be ex&shy;
<lb />pected, and therefore he considered his admiration as
<lb />inevitable; all that remained to be discovered, was
<lb />the reception it had met from his fair enslaver.  Nor
<lb />was he here long in doubt; he soon saw that she was
<lb />not merely free from all passion herself, but had so
<lb />little watched <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> as to be unconscious she
<lb />had inspired any.</p>
<p><lb />Yet was his own serenity, though apparently un&shy;
<lb />moved, little less disturbed in secret than that of his
<lb />rival; he did not think him a formidable candidate,
<lb />but he dreaded the effect of intimacy, fearing she
<lb />might first grow accustomed to his attentions, and
<lb />then become pleased with them:  he apprehended,
<lb />also, the influence of his sister, and of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> in
<lb />his favour; and though he had no difficulty to per&shy;
<lb />suade himself that any offer he might now make
<lb />would be rejected without hesitation, he knew too
<lb />well the insidious properties of perseverance, to see
<lb />him, without inquietude, situated so advantageously.</p>
<p><lb />The morning was far advanced before he took leave,
<lb />yet he found no opportunity of discoursing with
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though he impatiently desired to examine
<lb />into the state of her mind, and to discover whether
<lb />her London journey had added any fresh difficulties
<lb />to the success of his long-concerted scheme.  But as
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> invited him to dinner, he hoped the after&shy;
<lb />noon would be more propitious to his wishes.</p>
<pb n="081" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">77</mw>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, too, was eager to communicate to him
<lb />her favourite project, and to receive his advice with
<lb />respect to its execution.  She had long been used to
<lb />his counsel, and she was now more than ever solicit&shy;
<lb />ous to obtain it, because she considered him as the
<lb />only person in London who was interested in her
<lb />welfare.</p>
<p><lb />He saw, however, no promise of better success
<lb />when he made his appearance at dinner time, for not
	  <lb />only <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was already arrived, but <persName>Sir Robert
<lb />Floyer</persName>; and he found <persName>Cecilia</persName> so much the object of
<lb />their mutual attention, that he had still less chance
<lb />than in the morning of speaking to her unheard.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Yet he was not idle; the sight of <persName>Sir Robert</persName> gave
<lb />abundant employment to his penetration, which was
<lb />immediately at work, to discover the motive of his
<lb />visit:  but this, with all his sagacity, was not easily
<lb />decided; for though the constant direction of his
<lb />eyes towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>, proved, at least, that he was
<lb />not insensible of her beauty, his carelessness whether
<lb />or not she was hurt by his examination, the little
<lb />pains he took to converse with her, and the invariable
<lb />assurance and negligence of his manners, seemed
<lb />strongly to demonstrate an indifference to the sen&shy;
<lb />timents he inspired, totally incompatible with the so&shy;
<lb />licitude of affection.</p>
<p><lb />In <persName>Cecilia</persName> he had nothing to observe but what his
<lb />knowledge of her character prepared him to expect, a
<lb />shame no less indignant than modest at the freedom
<lb />with which she saw herself surveyed.</p>
<p><lb />Very little, therefore, was the satisfaction which
<lb />this visit procured him, for soon after dinner the
<lb />ladies retired; and as they had an early engagement
<pb n="082" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">78</mw>
<lb />for the evening, the gentlemen received no summons
<lb />to their tea-table.  But he contrived, before they
<lb />quitted the room, to make an appointment for attend&shy;
<lb />ing them the next morning to a rehearsal of a new
<lb />serious Opera.</p>
<p><lb />He stayed not after their departure longer than de&shy;
<lb />cency required; for too much in earnest was his pre&shy;
<lb />sent pursuit, to fit him for such conversation as the
<lb />house in <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s abscence could afford him.</p></div>

<lb />this intrusion, before he was disturbed by another;

	  <lb />panying them to the <placeName>Haymarket</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, to disguise his chagrin, pretended

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">79</mw>
<lb />quitting the breakfast room, when they were stopt
<lb />by the appearance of <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The surprise which the sight of him gave to <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> was extreme:  he knew that he was un&shy;
<lb />acquainted with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, for he remembered they
<lb />were strangers to each other when they lately met at
<lb />his house; he concluded, therefore, that <persName>Cecilia</persName> was
<lb />the object of his visit, but he could frame no con&shy;
<lb />jecture under what pretence.</p>
<p><lb />The easy terms upon which he seemed with all the
<lb />family, by no means diminished his amazement; for
<lb />when <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> expressed some concern that she
<lb />was obliged to go out, he gaily begged her not to
<lb />mind him, assuring her he could not have stayed two
<lb />minutes, and promising, unasked, to call again the
<lb />next day:  and when she added, <q id="q272" next="q273">We would not
<lb />hurry away so, only we are going to a rehearsal
<lb />of the Opera,</q> he exclaimed with quickness, <q id="q273" prev="q272">A
<lb />rehearsal!&mdash;are you really?  I have a great mind to
<lb />go too!</q></p>
<p><lb />Then, perceiving <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, he bowed to
<lb />him with great respect, and enquired, with no little
<lb />solemnity, how he had left Lady Margaret, hoped
<lb />she was perfectly recovered from her late indisposi&shy;
<lb />tion, and asked sundry questions with regard to her
<lb />plan for the winter.</p>
<p><lb />This discourse was ill constructed for rendering his
<lb />presence desirable to <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>; he answered
<lb />him very drily, and again pressed their departure.</p>

<lb />forgot the dances, and I suppose they are to be re&shy;

<lb />any dances rehearsed?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You'll be excessively entertained, then, I assure
<lb />you.  It's the most comical thing in the world to see

<lb />measure; you never saw such a shabby set in your

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q280" next="q281">Not a word against dancing!</q> cried <persName>Sir Robert</persName>,

<p><lb />The rehearsal was not begun, and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> secured

<lb />from which the gentlemen of their party took care

<p>	  <lb />They were soon perceived by <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, who

<p><lb />Just then <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, tapping at the door, came

	  <lb />She thanked him, and he followed <persName>Miss Larol&shy;

	  <lb />earnestness to <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, the gentleman with
<lb />whom she was conversing when <persName>Cecilia</persName> first saw her
	  <lb />in <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>.  He stopt a moment to let her
<lb />finish her speech, which, with no little spirit, she did
<lb />in these words, <q>I never knew any thing like it in
<lb />my life; but I shan't put up with such airs, I assure
<lb />her!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> made not any other return to her
<lb />harangue, but stretching himself with a languid smile
<lb />and yawning:  <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, therefore, seizing the
<lb />moment of cessation, said, <q><persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, I hear a
<lb />strange report about you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q294" next="q295">Do you?</q> returned she, with quickness; <q id="q295" prev="q294">pray
<lb />what is it? something monstrous impertinent, I dare
<lb />say;&mdash;however, I assure you it i'n't true.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q296" next="q297">Your assurance,</q> cried he, <q id="q297" prev="q296">carries conviction
<lb />indisputable, for the report was that you had left off
<lb />talking.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q298" next="q299">O, was that all,</q> cried she, disappointed; <q id="q299" prev="q298">I
	    <lb />thought it had been something about <persName>Mr. Sawyer</persName>, for
<lb />I declare I have been plagued so about him, I am
<lb />quite sick of his name.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And for my part, I never heard it!  so fear no&shy;
<lb />thing from me upon his account.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord, <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, how can you say so!  I am
<lb />sure you must know about the festino that night, for
<lb />it was all over the town in a moment.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What festino?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, only conceive how provoking!&mdash;Why, I
<lb />know nothing else was talked of for a month!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are most formidably stout this morning!  It
<pb n="087" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">83</mw>
<lb />is not two minutes since I saw you fling the gauntlet
<lb />at <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, and yet you are already prepared
<lb />for another antagonist.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O as to <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I must really beg you not
<lb />to mention her; she has behaved so impertinently,
<lb />that I don't ever intend to speak to her again.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, what has she done?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O she's been so rude you've no notion.  I'll tell
	    <lb />you how it was.  You must know I met her at <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel's</persName> the day she came to town, and the very next
<lb />morning I waited on her myself, for I would not send
<lb />a ticket, because I really wished to be civil to her;
<lb />well, the day after, she never came near me, though
<lb />I called upon her again; however, I did not take any
<lb />notice of that; but when the third day came, and I
<lb />found she had not even sent me a ticket, I thought
<lb />it monstrous ill bred indeed; and now there has past
<lb />more than a week, and yet she has never called:  so I
<lb />suppose she don't like me; so I shall drop her ac&shy;
<lb />quaintance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, satisfied now with the subject of her
<lb />complaint, returned to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and informed her of
<lb />the heavy charge which was brought against her.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q300" next="q301">I am glad, at least, to know my crime,</q> said
<lb />she; <q id="q301" prev="q300">for otherwise I should certainly have sinned
<lb />on in ignorance, as I must confess I never thought of
<lb />returning her visits:  but even if I had, I should not
<lb />have supposed I had yet lost much time.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q302" next="q303">I beg your pardon there,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q303" prev="q302">a

<lb />day.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q304" next="q305">Then have I an unanswerable excuse,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q305" prev="q304">for I remember that on the third day I
<lb />saw her at your house.</q></p>
<pb n="088" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">84</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>O that's nothing at all to the purpose; you
<lb />should have waited upon her, or sent her a ticket,
<lb />just the same as if you had not seen her.</q></p>
<p><lb />The overture was now begun, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> declined
<lb />any further conversation.  This was the first Opera
<lb />she had ever heard, yet she was not wholly a stranger
<lb />to Italian compositions, having assiduously studied
<lb />music from a natural love of the art, attended all the
<lb />best concerts her neighbourhood afforded, and re&shy;
	  <lb />gularly received from <placeName>London</placeName> the works of the best
<lb />masters.  But the little skill she had thus gained,
<lb />served rather to increase than to lessen the surprise
<lb />with which she heard the present performance&mdash;a sur&shy;
<lb />prise of which the discovery of her own ignorance
<lb />made not the least part.  Unconscious from the little
<lb />she had acquired, how much was to be learnt, she was
<lb />astonished to find the inadequate power of written
<lb />music to convey any idea of vocal abilities:  with
<lb />just knowledge enough, therefore, to understand
<lb />something of the difficulties, and feel much of the
<lb />merit, she gave to the whole Opera an avidity of at&shy;
<lb />tention almost painful from its own eagerness.</p>
<p><lb />But both the surprise and pleasure which she
<lb />received from the performance in general, were faint,
<lb />cold, and languid, compared to the strength of those
	  <lb />emotions when excited by <persName>Signore Pacchierotti</persName> in
<lb />particular; and though not half the excellencies of
<lb />that superior singer were necessary either to amaze
<lb />or charm her unaccustomed ears, though the refine&shy;
<lb />ment of his taste and masterly originality of his
<lb />genius, to be praised as they deserved, called for the
<lb />judgement and knowledge of professors, yet a natural
<lb />love of music in some measure supplied the place of
<pb n="089" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">85</mw>
<lb />cultivation, and what she could neither explain nor
<lb />understand, she could feel and enjoy.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The opera was <title>Artaserse</title>; and the pleasure she
<lb />received from the music was much augmented by her
<lb />previous acquaintance with that interesting drama;
<lb />yet, as to all noviciates in science, whatever is least
<lb />complicated is most pleasing, she found herself by
<lb />nothing so deeply impressed, as by the plaintive and
	  <lb />beautiful simplicity with which <persName>Pacchierotti</persName> uttered
<lb />the affecting repetition of <foreign lang="ita">sono innocente!</foreign>  his voice,
<lb />always wither sweet or impassioned, delivered those
<lb />words in a tone of softness, pathos, and sensibility,
<lb />that struck her with a sensation not more new than
<lb />delightful.</p>
<p><lb />But though she was, perhaps, the only person
<lb />thus astonished, she was by no means the only one en&shy;
<lb />raptured; for notwithstanding she was too earnestly
<lb />engaged to remark the company in general, she could
<lb />not avoid taking notice of an old gentleman who
<lb />stood by one of the side scenes, against which he
<lb />leant his head in a manner that concealed his face,
<lb />with an evident design to be wholly absorbed in
	  <lb />listening:  and during the songs of <persName>Pacchierotti</persName> he
<lb />sighed so deeply, that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, struck by his uncom&shy;
<lb />mon sensibility to the power of music, involuntarily
<lb />watched him, whenever her mind was sufficiently at
<lb />liberty to attend to any emotions but its own.</p>
<p><lb />As soon as the rehearsal was over, the gentlemen
<lb />of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s party crowded before her box; and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then perceived that the person whose musical
<lb />enthusiasm had excited her curiosity, was the same
<lb />old gentleman whose extraordinary behaviour had so
<lb />much surprised her at the house of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.

<lb />Her desire to obtain some information concerning
<lb />him again reviving, she was beginning to make
<lb />fresh enquiries, when she was interrupted by the
	  <lb />approach of <persName>Captain Aresby</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />That gentleman, advancing to her with a smile of
<lb />the extremest self-complacency, after hoping, in a
<lb />low voice, he had the honour of seeing her well, ex&shy;
<lb />claimed, <q>How wretchedly empty is the town!  pe&shy;

<p><lb /><q id="q306" next="q307">Really!</q> said the captain, unsuspicious of his

<p><lb /><q>No, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nor I; I don't know whether people go there

<p><lb /><q id="q310" next="q311">The man-hater?</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who found

<p><lb />The captain, who had not heard this speech, which

<lb />whose friends had done me the honour to fix upon
<lb />me the principle of first bringing her out:
<lb />and while I was doing <foreign lang="fre">mon possible</foreign> for killing the

<lb />told her I had no meaning in any thing I said!  I
<lb />must own I never felt more tempted to be <foreign lang="fre">enrage</foreign>
<lb />with a person in years, in my life.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> now brought the ladies word that their

<lb />as <persName>Cecilia</persName> had never before seen the interior parts of

<lb />to have an opportunity of talking with her, asked
<lb /><persName>Morrice</persName> why he did not <emph>shew the lyons?</emph>  <persName>Morrice</persName>,
<lb />always happy in being employed, declared it was

<lb />the search of amusement, willingly accepted his offer.</p>
<p><lb />They, all, therefore, marched upon the stage, their

<p><lb /><q>No, Sir, but I take you to be past childhood, and

<p><lb />At this moment the incognito, quitting the corner

<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely struck by this extraordinary ad&shy;

<lb />Having uttered these words with vehemence and

<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, too much astonished for speech, stood for
<lb />some time immoveable, revolving in her mind various
<lb />conjectures upon the meaning of an exhortation so

<p><lb />Nor was the rest of the company much less dis&shy;

<lb />were each apprehensive that the warning pointed at

<lb />rel</persName> was provoked at being interrupted in her ramble;

	  <lb />strances of <persName>Mrs Harrel</persName>, consented to call upon <persName>Miss
<lb />Larolles</persName>.  She felt the impracticality of beginning

<milestone unit="sig" n="M3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">93</mw>
<lb />at present the alteration in her way of life she had
<lb />projected, and therefore thought it most expedient to
<lb />assume no singularity, till her independency should
<lb />enable her to support it with consistency; yet greater
<lb />than ever was her internal eagerness to better satisfy
<lb />her inclination and her conscience in the disposition
<lb />of her time, and the distribution of her wealth,
<lb />since she had heard the emphatic charge of her un&shy;
<lb />known Mentor.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> declined accompanying her in this visit,
<lb />because she had appointed a surveyor to bring a
<lb />plan for the inspection of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and herself, of
	  <lb />a small temporary building, to be erected at <placeName>Violet-
<lb />Bank</placeName>, for the purpose of performing plays in private
<lb />the ensuing Easter.</p>
<p><lb />When the street door was opened for her to get
<lb />into the carriage, she was struck with the appearance
<lb />of an elderly woman who was standing at some dis&shy;
<lb />tance, and seemed shivering with cold, and who, as
<lb />she descended the steps, joined her hands in an act of
<lb />supplication, and advanced nearer to the carriage.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> stopt to look at her:  her dress, though par&shy;
<lb />simonious, was too neat for a beggar; and she con&shy;
<lb />sidered a moment what she could offer her.  The
<lb />poor woman continued to move forward, but with a
<lb />slowness of pace that indicated extreme weakness;
<lb />and, as she approached and raised her head, she ex&shy;
<lb />hibited a countenance so wretched, and a complexion
<lb />so sickly, that <persName>Cecilia</persName> was impressed with horror at
<lb />the sight.</p>
<p><lb />With her hands still joined, and a voice that
<lb />seemed fearful of its own sound, <q id="q346" next="q347">Oh, madam,</q>
<lb />she cried, <q id="q347" prev="q346">that you would but hear me!</q></p>
<pb n="098" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">94</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q id="q348" next="q349">Hear you!</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>, hastily feeling for
<lb />her purse, <q id="q349" prev="q348">most certainly; and tell me how I shall
<lb />assist you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q350" next="q351">Heaven bless you for speaking so kindly, ma&shy;
<lb />dam!</q> cried the woman with a voice more assured;
<lb /><q id="q351" prev="q350">I was sadly afraid you would be angry, but I saw
<lb />the carriage at the door, and I thought I would try;
<lb />for I could be no worse; and distress, madam, makes
<lb />very bold.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q352" next="q353">Angry!</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, taking a crown from her
<lb />purse; <q id="q353" prev="q352">no, indeed!&mdash;who could see such wretched&shy;
<lb />ness, and feel any thing but pity!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q354" next="q355">Oh, madam,</q> returned the poor woman, <q id="q355" prev="q354">I
<lb />could almost cry to hear you talk so, though I never
<lb />thought to cry again, since I left it off for my poor
	    <lb /><persName>Billy</persName>!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Have you, then, lost a son?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, madam; but he was a great deal too good
<lb />to live, so I have quite left off grieving for him now.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q356" next="q357">Come in, good woman,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q357" prev="q356">it is too
<lb />cold to stand here, and you seem half starved already:
<lb />come in, and let me have some talk with you.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then gave orders that the carriage should be
<lb />driven round the square till she was ready, and
<lb />making the woman follow her into a parlour, desired
<lb />to know what she should do for her:  changing, while
<lb />she spoke, from a movement of increasing compassion,
<lb />the crown which she held in her hand for double that
<lb />sum.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q358" next="q359">You can do every thing, madam,</q> she answered,
<lb /><q id="q359" prev="q358">if you will but plead for us to his honour:  he little
<lb />thinks of our distress, because he has been afflicted
<lb />with none himself; and I would not be so trouble&shy;
<pb n="099" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">95</mw>
<lb />some to him, but indeed, indeed, madam, we are
<lb />quite pinched for want!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, struck with the words <emph>he little thinks of
<lb />our distress, because he has been afflicted with none
<lb />himself</emph> felt again ashamed of the smallness of her
<lb />intended donation, and taking from her purse another
<lb />half guinea, said, <q>Will this assist you?  Will a
<lb />guinea be sufficient for the present?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q360" next="q361">I humbly thank you, madam,</q> said the woman,
<lb />curtsying low; <q id="q361" prev="q360">shall I give you a receipt?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q362" next="q363">A receipt!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with emotion, <q id="q363" prev="q362">for
<lb />what?</q>  <q>Alas, our accounts are by no means balanced!
<lb />but I shall do more for you, if I find you as deserving
<lb />an object as you seem to be.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are very good, madam; but I only meant a
<lb />receipt in part of payment.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Payment for what?  I don't understand you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Did his honour never tell you, madam, of our
<lb />account?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What account?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Our bill, madam, for work done to the new
	    <lb />Temple at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName>:  it was the last great work
<lb />my poor husband was able to do, for it was there he
<lb />met with his misfortune.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q364" next="q365">What bill?  What misfortune?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
	  <lb /><q id="q365" prev="q364">What had your husband to do at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>He was the carpenter, madam.  I thought you
	    <lb />might have seen poor <persName>Hill</persName> the carpenter there.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, I never was there myself.  Perhaps you
<lb />mistake me for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why sure, Madam, a'n't you his honour's
<lb />lady?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No.  But tell me, what is this bill?</q></p>
<pb n="100" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">96</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>'Tis a bill, madam, for very hard work, for work,
<lb />madam, which I am sure will cost my husband his
<lb />life; and though I have been after his honour night
<lb />and day to get it, and sent him letters and petitions
<lb />with an account of our misfortunes, I have never
<lb />received so much as a shilling! and now the servants
<lb />won't even let me wait in the hall to speak to him.
<lb />Oh madam! you who seem so good, plead to his ho&shy;
<lb />nour in our behalf! tell him my poor husband cannot
<lb />live! tell him my children are starving!  and tell him
	    <lb />my poor <persName>Billy</persName>, that used to help to keep us, is dead,
<lb />and that all the work I can do by myself is not enough
<lb />to maintain us!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q367" next="q368">Good heaven!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely moved, <q id="q368" prev="q367">is
<lb />it then your own money for which you sue thus humbly?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, madam, for my own just and honest money,
<lb />as his honour knows, and will tell you himself.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q369" next="q370">Impossible!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q370" prev="q369">he cannot know it;
<lb />but I will take care he shall soon be informed of it.
<lb />How much is the bill?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Two-and-twenty pounds, madam.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What, no more?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah madam, you gentlefolks little think how much
<lb />that is to poor people!  A hard-working family, like
<lb />mine, madam, with the help of 20 <term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. will go on for a
<lb />long while quite in paradise.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q371" next="q372">Poor worthy woman!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose eyes
<lb />were filled with tears of compassion, <q id="q372" prev="q371">if 20 <term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. will
<lb />place you in paradise, and that 20 <term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. only your just
<lb />right, it is hard, indeed, that you should be kept
<lb />without it; especially when your debtors are too
<lb />affluent to miss it.  Stay here a few moments, and I
<lb />will bring you the money immediately.</q></p>
<pb n="101" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">97</mw>
<p>
<lb />Away she flew, and returned to the breakfast room,
<lb />but found there only <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who told her that
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was in the library, with his sister and
<lb />some gentlemen.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> briefly related her business,
<lb />and begged he would inform <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> she wished
<lb />to speak to him directly.  <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> shook his head,
<lb />but obeyed.</p>
<p>	  <lb />They returned together, and immediately, <q><persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, gaily, <q>I am glad you
<lb />are not gone, for we want much to consult with you.
<lb />Will you come upstairs?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q373" next="q374">Presently,</q> answered she; <q id="q374" prev="q373">but first I must
<lb />speak to you about a poor woman with whom I have
<lb />accidentally been talking, who has begged me to inter&shy;
<lb />cede with you to pay a little debt she thinks you
<lb />have forgotten, but that probably you have never
<lb />heard mentioned.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q375" next="q376">A debt,</q> cried he, with an immediate change of
<lb />countenance, <q id="q376" prev="q375">to whom?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Her name, I think, is <persName>Hill</persName>; she is wife to the
	    <lb />carpenter you employed about a new temple at <placeName>Vio&shy;
<lb />let-Bank</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O what&mdash;what that woman?&mdash;Well, well, I'll
<lb />see she shall be paid.  Come, let us go to the li&shy;
<lb />brary.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What, with my commision so ill executed?  I
<lb />promised to petition for her to have the money
<lb />directly.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pho, pho, there's no such hurry; I don't know
<lb />what I have done with her bill.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I'll run and get another.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O upon no account!  She may send another in
<lb />two or three days.  She deserves to wait a twelve&shy;

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">98</mw>
<lb />month for her impertinence in troubling you at all
<lb />about it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That was entirely accidental:  but indeed you
<lb />must give me leave to perform my promise and plead
<lb />for her.  It must be almost the same to you whether
<lb />you pay such a trifle as twenty pounds now, or a
<lb />month hence; and to this poor woman, the difference
<lb />seems little short of life or death; for she tells me
<lb />her husband is dying, and her children half famished,
<lb />and though she looks an object of the cruellest want
<lb />and distress herself, she appears to be their only
<lb />support.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q377" next="q378">O,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, laughing, <q id="q378" prev="q377">what a dismal
<lb />tale she has been telling you! no doubt she saw you
<lb />were fresh from the country!  But if you give credit
<lb />to all the farragos of these trumpery impostors, you
<lb />will never have a moment to yourself, nor a guinea in
<lb />your purse.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q379" next="q380">This woman,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q380" prev="q379">cannot be an
<lb />impostor, she carries marks but too evident and too
<lb />dreadful in her countenance of the sufferings which
<lb />she relates.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q381" next="q382">O,</q> returned he, <q id="q382" prev="q381">when you know the town
<lb />better, you will soon see through tricks of this
<lb />sort; a sick husband and five small children are com&shy;
<lb />plaints so stale now, that they serve no other purpose
<lb />in the world but to make a joke.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Those, however, who can laugh at them, must
<lb />have notions of merriment very different to mine.
<lb />And this poor woman, whose cause I have ventured
<lb />to undertake, had she no family at all, must still and
<lb />indisputably be an object of pity herself, for she is so
<pb n="103" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="N2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">99</mw>
<lb />weak she can hardly crawl, and so palid, that she
<lb />seems already half dead.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>All imposition, depend upon it!  The moment
<lb />she is out of your sight, her complaints will vanish.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q383" next="q384">Nay, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, a little impatiently,
<lb /><q id="q384" prev="q383">there is no reason to suspect such deceit, since she
<lb />does not come hither as a beggar, however well the
<lb />state of beggary may accord with her poverty:  she
<lb />only solicits the payment of a bill; and if in that there
<lb />is any fraud, nothing can be so easy as detection.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> bit his lips at this speech, and for some
<lb />instants looked much disturbed; but soon recovering
<lb />himself, he negligently said, <q>Pray how did she get
<lb />at you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I met her at the street-door.  But tell me, is not
<lb />her bill a just one?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I cannot say; I have never had time to look
<lb />at it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But you know who the woman is, and that her
<lb />husband worked for you, and therefore that in all pro&shy;
<lb />bability it is right&mdash;do you not?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, yes, I know who the woman is well enough;
<lb />she has taken care of that, for she has pestered me
<lb />every day these nine months.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was struck dumb by this speech:  hitherto
<lb />she had supposed that the dissipation of his life kept
<lb />him ignorant of his own injustice; but when she found
<lb />he was so well informed of it, yet, with such total in&shy;
<lb />difference, could suffer a poor woman to claim a just
<lb />debt every day for nine months together, she was
<lb />shocked and astonished beyond measure.  They were
<lb />both some time silent, and then <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, yawning
<pb n="104" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="N2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">100</mw>
<lb />and
<lb />stretching out his arms, indolently asked, <q>Pray
<lb />why does not the man come himself?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q385" next="q386">Did I not tell you,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, staring at
<lb />so absent a question, <q id="q386" prev="q385">that he was very ill, and un&shy;
<lb />able even to work?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q387" next="q388">Well, when he is better,</q> added he, moving to&shy;
<lb />wards the door, <q id="q388" prev="q387">he may call, and I will talk to
<lb />him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, all amazement at this unfeeling behaviour,
<lb />turned involuntarily to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, with a counte&shy;
	  <lb />nance that appealed for his assistance; but <persName>Mr. Ar&shy;
<lb />nott</persName> hung his head, ashamed to meet her eyes, and
<lb />abruptly left the room.</p>
<p><lb />Mean time <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, half turning back, though
<lb />without looking <persName>Cecilia</persName> in the face, carelessly said,
<lb /><q>Well, won't you come?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir,</q> answered she, coldly.</p>
<p><lb />He then returned to the library, leaving her equal&shy;
<lb />ly displeased, surprised, and disconcerted at the con&shy;
<lb />versation which had just past between them.  <q id="q389" next="q390">Good
<lb />heaven,</q> cried she to herself, <q id="q390" prev="q389">what strange, what
<lb />cruel insensibility! to suffer a wretched family to
<lb />starve, from an obstinate determination to assert that
<lb />they can live! to distress the poor by retaining the
<lb />recompense for which alone they labor, and which
<lb />at last they must have, merely from indolence, forget&shy;
<lb />fullness, or insolence!  O how little did my uncle
<lb />know, how little did I imagine to what a guardian I
<lb />was entrusted!</q>  She now felt ashamed even to re&shy;
<lb />turn to the poor woman, though she resolved to do all
<lb />in her power to soften her disappointment, and re&shy;
<lb />lieve her distress.</p>
<pb n="105" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="N3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">101</mw>
<p>
<lb />But before she had quitted the room, one of the
<lb />servants came to tell her that his master begged the
<lb />honour of her company up stairs.  <q>Perhaps he re&shy;
<lb />lents!</q> thought she; and pleased with the hope,
<lb />readily obeyed the summons.</p>
<p><lb />She found him, his lady, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, and
<lb />two other gentlemen, all earnestly engaged in an ar&shy;
<lb />gument over a large table, which was covered with
<lb />plans and elevations of small buildings.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> immediately addressed her with an air
<lb />of vivacity, and said, <q>You are very good for coming;
<lb />we can settle nothing without your advice; pray look
<lb />at these different plans for our theatre, and tell us
<lb />which is the best.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> advanced not a step:  the sight of plans for
<lb />new edifices when the workmen were yet unpaid for
<lb />old ones, the cruel wantonness of raising fresh fabrics
<lb />of expensive luxury, while those so lately built had
<lb />brought their neglected labourers to ruin, excited an
<lb />indignation she scarce thought right to repress:  while
<lb />the easy sprightliness of the director of these revels,
<lb />to whom but the moment before she had represented
<lb />the oppression of which they made him guilty, filled
<lb />her with aversion and disgust:  and recollecting the
<lb />charge given her by the stranger at the Opera rehear&shy;
<lb />sal, she resolved to speed her departure to another
<lb />house, internally repeating, <q>Yes, I <emph>will</emph> save myself
<lb />from <emph>the impending destruction of unfeeling pros&shy;
<lb />perity!</emph></q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, surprised at her silence and extreme
<lb />gravity, enquired if she was not well, and why she
	  <lb />had put off her visit to <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>?  And <persName>Sir Ro&shy;
<pb n="106" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="N3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">102</mw>
<lb />bert Floyer</persName>, turning suddenly to look at her, said,
<lb /><q>Do you begin to feel the London air already?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> endeavoured to recover her serenity, and
<lb />answer these questions in her usual manner; but she
<lb />persisted in declining to give any opinion at all about
<lb />the plans, and, after slightly looking at them, left the
<lb />room.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who knew better how to account for
<lb />her behaviour than he thought proper to declare, saw
<lb />with concern that she was more seriously displeased,
<lb />than he had believed an occurrence which he had re&shy;
<lb />garded as wholly unimportant, could have made her:
<lb />and therefore desirous that she should be appeased,
	  <lb />he followed her out of the library, and said, <q><persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>, will to-morrow be soon enough for your
<lb /><foreign lang="fre">Protegee?</foreign></q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O yes, no doubt!</q> answered she, most agreeably
<lb />surprised by the question.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, then, will you take the trouble to bid her
<lb />come to me in the morning?</q></p>
<p><lb />Delighted at this unexpected commission, she
<lb />thanked him with smiles for the office; and as she
<lb />hastened down stairs to cheer the poor expectant with
<lb />the welcome intelligence, she framed a thousand ex&shy;
<lb />cuses for the part he had hitherto acted, and without
<lb />any difficulty, persuaded herself he began to see the
<lb />faults of his conduct, and to mediate a reformation.</p>
<p><lb />She was received by the poor creature she so warm&shy;
<lb />ly wished to serve with a countenance already so much
<lb />enlivened, that she fancied <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had himself
<lb />anticipated her intended information:  this, however,
<lb />she found was not the case, for as soon as she heard
<pb n="107" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="N4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">103</mw>
<lb />his message, she shook her head and said, <q>Ah, ma&shy;
<lb />dam, his honour always says to-morrow! but I can
<lb />better bear to be disappointed now, so I'll grumble no
<lb />more; for, indeed, madam, I have been blest enough
<lb />to-day to comfort me for every thing in the world, if
<lb />I could but keep from thinking of poor Billy!  I could
<lb />bear all the rest, madam, but whenever my other
<lb />troubles go off, that comes back to me so much the
<lb />harder!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q391" next="q392">There, indeed, I can afford you no relief,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q392" prev="q391">but you must try to think less of him, and
<lb />more of your husband and children who are now
<lb />alive.  To-morrow you will receive your money, and
<lb />that, I hope will raise your spirits.  And pray let
<lb />your husband have a physician, to tell you how to
<lb />nurse and manage him; I will give you one fee for
<lb />him now, and if he should want further advice, don't
<lb />fear to let me know.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> had again taken out her purse, but <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Hill</persName>, clasping her hands, called out, <q>Oh madam,
<lb />no!  I don't come here to fleece such goodness! but
<lb />blessed be the hour that brought me here to day, and
	    <lb />if my poor <persName>Billy</persName> was alive, he should help me to thank
<lb />you!</q></p>
<p><lb />She then told her that she was now quite rich, for
<lb />while she was gone, a gentleman had come into the
<lb />room who had given her five guineas.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, by her description, soon found this gentle&shy;
<lb />man was <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and a charity so sympathetic
<lb />with her own, failed not to raise him greatly in her

<lb />enquire for her the next morning when she came to
<lb />be paid, bid her hasten back to her sick husband.</p>
<p><lb />And then, again ordering the carriage to the door,
<lb />she set off upon her visit to <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, with a
<lb />heart happy in the good already done, and happier
<lb />still in the hope of doing more.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> was out, and she returned home;
<lb />for she was too sanguine in her expectations from
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, to have any desire of seeking her other
<lb />guardians.  The rest of the day she was more than
<lb />usually civil to him, with a view to mark her approba&shy;
<lb />tion of his good intentions; while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, grati&shy;
<lb />fied by meeting the smiles he so much valued, thought
<lb />his five guineas amply repaid, independently of the
<lb />real pleasure which he took in doing good.</p></div>

<lb />therefore went into the hall herself, to enquire among

<p><lb />Yes, they answered, and had seen their master, and
<lb />was gone.</p>
<p><lb />She then returned to the breakfast room, where
<lb />her eagerness to procure some information detained
<lb />her, though the entrance of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> made
<lb />her wish to retire.  But she was wholly at a loss
<lb />whether to impute to general forgetfulness, or to
<lb />the failure of performing his promise, the silence of
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> upon the subject of her petition.</p>
<p><lb />In a few minutes they were visited by <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>,
<lb />who said he called to acquiant the ladies that the
<lb />next morning there was to be a rehearsal of a very
<lb />grand new dance at the Opera-house, where, though
<lb />admission was difficult, if it was agreeable to them to
<lb />go, he would undertake to introduce them.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> happened to be engaged, and there&shy;
<lb />fore declined the offer.  He then turned to <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />and said, <q>Well ma'am, when did you see our friend
	    <lb /><persName>Monckton</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not since the rehearsal, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q393" next="q394">He is a mighty agreeable fellow,</q> he continued,
<lb /><q id="q394" prev="q393">and his house in the country is charming.  One is

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q395" next="q396">Not I, truly,</q> replied <persName>Sir Robert</persName>; <q id="q396" prev="q395">what should
<lb />I go for?&mdash;-to see an old woman with never a tooth in

<p><lb /><q id="q397" next="q398">O but you don't know how well she does the ho&shy;

<p><lb /><q id="q401" next="q402">I am sure I wish he had,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q403" next="q404">But an old woman,</q> answered <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <q id="q404" prev="q403">is
<lb />a person who has no sense of decency; if once she
<lb />takes to living, the devil himself can't get rid of
<lb />her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q405" next="q406">I dare say,</q> cried <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q id="q406" prev="q405">she'll pop off

<lb />she'd give up the ghost, he told me she might live

<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was by no means sorry to have this brutal
<lb />conversation interrupted by the entrance of a

<lb />The vexation with which <persName>Cecilia</persName> read this letter
	  <lb />was visible to the whole company; and while <persName>Mr.

<lb />not dare express, and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, under an ap&shy;

<lb />curiosity, <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName> alone had courage to inter&shy;
<lb />rogate her, and, pertly advancing, said, <q>He is a

<p><lb /><q id="q418" next="q419">I could propose a much better scheme than

<lb />I am about there? what say you, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, I shall like it vastly.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q420" next="q421">Done,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q421" prev="q420">'tis an excellent

<p>	  <lb /><q id="q422" next="q423">Come then,</q> said <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <q id="q423" prev="q422">let's be off.
<lb /><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I hope you have a good warm cloak?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I must beg you to excuse my attending you,
<lb />Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who had heard this proposal with
<lb />the utmost dread of its success, revived at the calm
	  <lb />steadiness with which it was declined.  <persName>Mr</persName>. and <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName> both teized <persName>Cecilia</persName> to consent; but the
<lb />haughty Baronet, evidently more offended than hurt
<lb />by her refusal, pressed the matter no further, either
<lb />with her or the rest of the party, and the scheme was
<lb />dropt entirely.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> failed not to remark this circum&shy;
<lb />stance, which confirmed his suspicions, that though
<lb />the propsal seemed made by chance, his design was
<lb />nothing else than to obtain <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s opinion concern&shy;
<pb n="113" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="O3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">109</mw>
<lb />ing his house.  But while this somewhat alarmed him,
<lb />the unabated insolence of his carriage, and the con&shy;
<lb />fident defiance of his pride, still more surprised him;
<lb />and notwithstanding all he observed of <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />seemed to promise nothing but dislike, he could draw
<lb />no other inference from his behaviour, than that if he
<lb />admired, he also concluded himself sure of her.</p>
<p><lb />This was not a pleasant conjecture, however little
<lb />weight he allowed to it; and he resolved, by out&shy;
<lb />staying all the company, to have a few minutes
<lb />private discourse with her upon the subject.</p>
<p>	  <lb />In about half an hour, <persName>Sir Robert</persName> and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />went out together:  <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> still persevered
<lb />in keeping his ground, and tried, though already
<lb />weary, to keep up a general conversation; but what
<lb />moved at once his wonder and his indignation was
<lb />the assurance of <persName>Morrice</persName>, who seemed not only bent
<lb />upon staying as long as himself, but determined, by
<lb />rattling away, to make his own entertainment.</p>
<p><lb />At length a servant came in to tell <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>
<lb />that a stranger, who was waiting in the house&shy;
<lb />keeper's room, begged to speak with her upon
<lb />very particular business.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q424" next="q425">O I know,</q> cried she, <q id="q425" prev="q424">'tis that odious <persName>John
<lb />Groot</persName>:  do pray, brother, try to get rid of him for me,
<lb />for he comes to teize me about his bill, and I never
<lb />know what to say to him.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> went immediately, and <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<lb />ton</persName> could scarce refrain from going too, that he might
	  <lb />entreat <persName>John Groot</persName> by no means to be satisfied
<lb />without seeing <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> herself:  John Groot,
<lb />however, wanted not his entreaties, as the servant
<lb />soon returned to summon his lady to the conference.</p>
<pb n="114" />

<p>
<lb />But though <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> now seemed near the
<lb />completion of his purpose, <persName>Morrice</persName> still remained;
<lb />his vexation at this curcumstance soon grew intole&shy;
<lb />rable; to see himself upon the point of receiving the
<lb />recompense of his perseverance, by the fortunate
<lb />removal of all the obstacles in its way, and then to
<lb />have it held from him by a young fellow he so much
<lb />despised, and who had no entrance into the house
<lb />but through his own boldness, and no inducement
<lb />to stay in it but from his own impertinence, mortified
<lb />him so insufferably, that it was with difficulty he even
<lb />forbore affronting him.  Nor would he have scrupled
<lb />a moment desiring him to leave the room, had he not
<lb />prudently determined to guard with the utmost
<lb />sedulity against raising any suspicions of his passion
<lb />for <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />He arose, however, and was moving towards her,
<lb />with the intention to occupy a part of a sofa on which
<lb />she was seated, when <persName>Morrice</persName>, who was standing at the
<lb />back of it, with a sudden spring which made the
<lb />whole room shake, jumpt over, and sunk plump into
<lb />the vacant place himself, calling out at the same
<lb />time.  <q>Come, come, what have you married men to
<lb />do with young ladies?  I shall seize this post for
<lb />myself.</q></p>
<p><lb />The rage of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> at this feat, and still
<lb />more at the words <emph>married men,</emph> almost exceeded
<lb />endurance; he stopt short, and looking at him with a
<lb />fierceness that overpowered his discretion, was burst&shy;
<lb />ing out with, <q id="q426" next="q427">Sir you are an&mdash;&mdash;<emph>impudent fellow;</emph></q>
<lb />but checking himself when he got half way, con&shy;
<lb />cluded with, <q id="q427" prev="q426">a very facetious gentleman!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Morrice</persName>, who wished nothing so little as disobliging
<pb n="115" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="O4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">111</mw>
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, and whose behaviour was merely the
<lb />result of levity, and a want of early education, no
<lb />sooner perceived his displeasure, than rising with
<lb />yet more agility than he had seated himself, he re&shy;
<lb />sumed the obsequiousness of which an uncommon
<lb />flow of spirits had robbed him, and guessing no other
<lb />subject for his anger than the disturbance he had
<lb />made, he bowed almost to the ground, first to him, and
<lb />afterwards to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, most respectfully begging
<lb />pardon of them both for his frolic, and protesting he
<lb />had no notion he should have made such a noise!</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> now hastening back,
<lb />enquired what had been the matter?  <persName>Morrice</persName>,
<lb />ashamed of his exploit, and frigtened by the looks
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, made an apology with the utmost
<lb />humility, and hurried away:  and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
<lb />hopeless of any better fortune, soon did the same,
<lb />gnawn with a cruel discontent which he did not dare
<lb />avow, and longing to revenge himself upon <persName>Morrice</persName>,
<lb />even by personal chastisement.</p></div>

<lb />call upon her as soon as she was at leisure.  The ac&shy;
<lb />count which he brought back increased her concern
<lb />for the injuries of these poor people, and determined
<lb />her not to rest till she saw them redressed.  He
<lb />informed her that they lived in a small lodging up
<lb />two pair of stairs; that there were five children, all
<lb />girls, the three eldest of whom were hard at work
<lb />with their mother in matting chair-bottoms, and the
<lb />fourth, though a mere child, was nursing the youngest;
<lb />while the poor carpenter himself was confined to his
<lb />bed, in consequence of a fall from a ladder while
<lb />working at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName>, by which he was covered
<lb />with wounds and contusions, and an object of misery

<p>	  <lb />As soon as <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> came, <persName>Cecilia</persName> sent for her into

<p><lb /><q id="q428" next="q429">To-morrow, madam,</q> she answered, shaking her

<p><lb /><q>Do you mean, then, to apply to the law?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I must not tell you, madam; but to be sure we
<lb />have thought of it many a sad time and often; but

<lb />make enemies; but indeed, madam, his honour was
<lb />so hardhearted this morning, that if I was not afraid
<lb />you would be angry, I could not tell how to bear it;
<lb />for when I told him I had no help now, for I had lost

<lb /><q id="q430" next="q431">But what,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely shocked by
<lb />this unfeeling speech, <q id="q431" prev="q430">is the reason he gives for
<lb />disappointing you so often?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>He says, madam, that none of the other work&shy;
<lb />men are paid yet; and that, to be sure, is very true;
<lb />but then they can all better afford to wait than we can,
<lb />for we were the poorest of all, madam, and have
<lb />been misfortunate from the beginning; and his ho&shy;
<lb />nour would never have employed us, only he had run
	    <lb />up such a bill with <persName>Mr. Wright</persName>, that he would not
<lb />undertake any thing more till he was paid.  We were
<lb />told from the first we should not get our money; but
<lb />we were willing to hope for the best, for we had no&shy;
<lb />thing to do, and were hard run, and had never had
<lb />the offer of so good a job before; and we had a
<lb />great family to keep, and many losses, and so much
<lb />illness!&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Oh madam! if you did but know
<lb />what the poor go through!</q></p>
<p><lb />This speech opened to <persName>Cecilia</persName> a new view of life;
<lb />that a young man could appear so gay and happy, yet
<lb />be guilty of such injustice and inhumanity; that he
<lb />could take pride in works which not even money had
<lb />made his own, and live with undiminished splendor,
<lb />when his credit itself began to fail, seemed to her in&shy;
<lb />congruities so irrational, that hitherto she had sup&shy;
<lb />posed them impossible.</p>
<p><lb />She then enquired if her husband had yet had any

<p><lb /><q id="q432" next="q433">Yes, madam, I humbly thank your goodness,</q>

<lb />and as pretty a lad! and so good, that he never cost
<lb />me a wet eye till I lost him.  He worked with his fa&shy;
<lb />ther, and all the folks used to say he was the better
<lb />workman of the two.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And what was the occasion of his death?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A consumption, madam, that wasted him quite to
<lb />nothing; and he was ill a long time, and cost us a
<lb />deal of money, for we spared neither for wine nor any
<lb />thing, that we thought would but comfort him; and
<lb />we loved him so we never grudged it.  But he died,

<lb />ever; for a widow, madam, is always hard to be
<lb />righted; and I don't expect to hold out long myself,
<lb />for sickness and sorrow wear fast: and then, when
<lb />we are both gone, who is to help our poor children?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q436" next="q437"><emph>I</emph> will!</q> cried the generous <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<q id="q437" prev="q436">I am able,
<lb />and I am willing; you shall not find all the rich hard&shy;
<lb />hearted, and I will try to make you some amends for
<lb />the unkindness you have suffered.</q></p>
<p><lb />The poor woman, overcome by a promise so unex&shy;
<lb />pected, burst into a passionate fit of tears, and sobbed
<lb />out her thanks with a violence of emotion that fright&shy;
<lb />ened <persName>Cecilia</persName> almost as much as it melted her.  She
<lb />endeavoured, by reiterated assurances of assistance,
<lb />to appease her, and solemnly pledged her own honour
<lb />that she should certainly be paid the following Satur&shy;
<lb />day, which was only three days distant.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> when a little calmer, dried her eyes, and
<lb />humbly begging her to forgive a transport which she
<lb />could not restrain, most gratefully thanked her for
<lb />the engagement into which she had entered, protesting
<lb />that she would not be <emph>troublesome to her goodness</emph> as
<lb />long as she could help it: <q id="q438" next="q439">And I believe,</q> she con&shy;
<lb />tinued, <q id="q439" prev="q438">that if his honour will but pay me time
<lb />enough for the burial, I can make shift with what I
	    <lb />have till then.  But when my poor <persName>Billy</persName> died, we
<lb />were sadly off indeed, for we could not bear but bury
<lb />him prettily, because it was the last we could do for
<lb />him: but we could hardly scrape up enough for it,
<lb />and yet we all went without our dinners to help for&shy;
<lb />ward, except the little one of all.  But that did not
<lb />much matter, for we had no great heart for eating.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q440" next="q441">I cannot bear this!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>: <q id="q441" prev="q440">you must tell
<pb n="120" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">116</mw>
	    <lb />me no more of your <persName>Billy</persName>; but go home and cheer
<lb />your spirits, and do every thing in your power to save
<lb />your husband.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q442" next="q443">I will, madam,</q> answered the woman, <q id="q443" prev="q442">and his
<lb />dying prayers shall bless you, and all my children
<lb />shall bless you, and every night they shall pray for
	    <lb />you.  And oh that <persName>Billy</persName> was but alive to pray for you
<lb />too!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> kindly endeavoured to soothe her, but the
<lb />poor creature, no longer able to suppress the violence
<lb />of her awakened sorrows, cried out, <q>I must go,
<lb />madam, and pray for you at home, for now I have
<lb />once begun crying again, I don't know how to have
<lb />done!</q> and hurried away.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> determined to make once more an effort with
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> for the payment of the bill, and if that, in
<lb />two days, did not succeed, to take up money for the
<lb />discharge of it herself, and rest all her security for re&shy;
<lb />imbursement upon the shame with which such a pro&shy;
<lb />ceeding must overwhelm him.  Offended, however,
<lb />by the repulse she had already received from him,
<lb />and disgusted by all that she had heard of his un&shy;
<lb />feeling negligence, she knew not how to address him,
<lb />and resolved upon applying again to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who
<lb />was already acquianted with the affair, for advice and
<lb />assistance.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, though extremely gratified that she
<lb />consulted him, betrayed by his looks an hopelessness
<lb />of success that damped all her expectations.  He pro&shy;
<lb />mised, however, to speak to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> upon the sub&shy;
<lb />ject, but the promise was evidently given to oblige
<lb />the fair mediatrix, without any hope of advantage to
<lb />the cause.</p>
<pb n="121" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">117</mw>
<p>
	  <lb />The next morning <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> again came, and again
<lb />without payment was dismissed.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> then, at the request of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, followed
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> into his room, to enquire into the reason
<lb />of this breach of promise; they continued some time
<lb />together, and when he returned to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he told
<lb />her, that his brother had assured him he would give
	  <lb />orders to <persName>Davison</persName>, his gentleman, to let her have the
<lb />money the next day.</p>
<p><lb />The pleasure with which she would have heard this
<lb />intelligence was much checked by the grave and cold
<lb />manner in which it was communicated: she waited,
<lb />therefore, with more impatience than confidence for
<lb />the result of this fresh assurance.</p>
<p><lb />The next morning, however, was the same as the
	  <lb />last; <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> came, saw <persName>Davison</persName>, and was sent
<lb />away.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whom she related her grievances, then
<lb />flew to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and entreated him to enquire at
<lb />least of Davison why the woman had again been dis&shy;
<lb />appointed.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> obeyed her, and brought for answer,
	  <lb />that <persName>Davison</persName> had received no orders from his master.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q444" next="q445">I entreat you then,</q> cried she, with mingled ea&shy;
	  <lb />gerness and vexation, <q id="q445" prev="q444">to go, for the last time, to <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>.  I am sorry to impose upon you an office so
<lb />disagreeable, but I am sure you compassionate these
<lb />poor people, and will serve them now with your in&shy;
<lb />terest, as you have already done with your purse.  I
<lb />only wish to know if there has been any mistake, or if
<lb />these delays are merely to sicken me of petitioning.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, with a repugnance to the request
<lb />which he could as ill conceal as his admiration of the
<pb n="122" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">118</mw>
	  <lb />zealous requester, again forced him to follow <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>.  His stay was not long, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> at his re&shy;
<lb />turn perceived that he was hurt and disconcerted.  As
<lb />soon as they were alone together, she begged to know
<lb />what had passed?  <q id="q446" next="q447">Nothing,</q> answered he, <q id="q447" prev="q446">that
<lb />will give you any pleasure.  When I entreated my
<lb />brother to come to the point, he said it was his inten&shy;
<lb />tion to pay all his workmen together, for that if he paid
<lb />any one singly, all the rest would be dissatisfied.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q448" next="q449">And why,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q449" prev="q448">should he not pay them
<lb />at once?  There can be no more comparison in the
<lb />value of the money to him and to them, than, to speak
<lb />with truth, there is in his and in their right to it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But, madam, the bills for the new house itself are
<lb />none of them settled, and he says that the moment he
<lb />is known to discharge an account for the Temple, he
<lb />shall not have any rest for the clamours it will raise
<lb />among the workmen who were employed about the
<lb />house.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q450" next="q451">How infinitely strange!</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q451" prev="q450">will
<lb />he not, then, pay any body?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Next quarter, he says, he shall pay them all, but,
<lb />at present, he has a particular call for his money.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> would not trust herself to make any com&shy;
<lb />ments upon such an avowal, but, thanking <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb />for the trouble which he had taken, she determined,
<lb />without any further application, to desire <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />to advance her 20<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. the next morning, and satisfy the
<lb />carpenter herself, be the risk what it might.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The following day, therefore, which was the <name>Satur&shy;
<lb />day</name> when payment was promised, she begged an au&shy;
<lb />dience of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, which he immediately granted;
<lb />but before she could make her demand, he said to her,
<pb n="123" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">119</mw>
<lb />with an air of the utmost gaiety and good-humour,
<lb /><q>Well, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, how fares it with your <foreign lang="fre">prote&shy;
<lb />gee?</foreign></q>  I hope, at length, she is contented.  But I
<lb />must beg you would charge her to keep her own coun&shy;
<lb />sel, as otherwise she will draw me into a scrape I shall
<lb />not thank her for.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Have you then paid her?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName> with
<lb />much amazement.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes; I promised you I would, you know.</q></p>
<p><lb />This intelligence equally delighted and astonished
<lb />her; she repeatedly thanked him for his attention to
<lb />her petition, and, eager to communicate her success to
<lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, she hastened to find him.  <q id="q452" next="q453">Now,</q> cried
<lb />she, <q id="q453" prev="q452">I shall torment you no more with painful com&shy;
	    <lb />missions; the <name>Hills</name>, at last, are paid!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q454" next="q455">From you, madam,</q> answered he gravely,
<q id="q455" prev="q454" rend="pre()"><sic corr="&amp;ldquo;"></sic>no
<lb />commissions could be painful.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q456" next="q457">Well but,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, somewhat disappointed,
<lb /><q id="q457" prev="q456">you don't seem to be glad of this!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q458" next="q459">Yes,</q> answered he, with a forced smile, <q id="q459" prev="q458">I am
<lb />very glad to see you so.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But how was it brought about? did <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />relent? or did you attack him again?</q></p>
<p><lb />The hesitation of his answer convinced her there
<lb />was some mystery in the transaction; she began to
<lb />apprehend she had been deceived, and hastily quit&shy;
	  <lb />ting the room, sent for <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>; but the moment
<lb />the poor woman appeared, she was satisfied of the
<lb />contrary, for, almost frantic with joy and gratitude,
<lb />she immediately flung herself upon her knees, to
<lb />thank her benefactress for having <emph>seen her
<lb />righted</emph>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then gave her some general advice, pro&shy;

<milestone unit="sig" n="P4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">120</mw>
<lb />mised to continue her friend, and offered her assistance
<lb />in getting her husband into an hospital: but she told
<lb />her he had already been in one many months, where
<lb />he was pronounced incurable, and was therefore de&shy;
<lb />sirous to spend his last days in his own lodgings.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q460" next="q461">Well,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q461" prev="q460">make them as easy to him
<lb />as you can, and come to me next week, and I will try
<lb />to put you in a better way of living.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then, still greatly perplexed about <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb />sought him again, and, after various questions and
<lb />conjectures, at length brought him to confess he had
	  <lb />himself lent his brother the sum with which the <name>Hills</name>
<lb />had been paid.</p>
<p><lb />Struck with his generosity, she poured forth thanks
<lb />and praises so grateful to his ears, that she soon gave
<lb />him a recompense which he would have thought
<lb />cheaply purchased by half his fortune.</p>

<p>

	  <lb />the credit, as well as accepted the assistance of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName>, encreased the disgust he had already excited
<lb />in <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and hastened her resolution of quitting
<lb />his house: and therefore, without waiting any longer
<lb />for the advice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, she resolved to go
<pb n="125" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">121</mw>
<lb />instantly to her other guardians, and see what better
<lb />prospects their habitations might offer.</p>
<p><lb />For this purpose, she borrowed one of the car&shy;
<lb />riages, and gave orders to be driven into the city, to
	  <lb />the house of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />She told her name, and was shewn, by a little
<lb />shabby foot-boy, into a parlour.</p>
<p><lb />Here she waited, with tolerable patience, for half
<lb />an hour, but then, imagining the boy had forgotten
<lb />to tell his master she was in the house, she thought it
<lb />expedient to make some enquiry.</p>
<p><lb />No bell, however, could she find, and therefore she
<lb />went into the passage in search of the foot-boy; but
<lb />as she was proceeding to the head of the kitchen
<lb />stairs, she was startled by hearing a man's voice from
<lb />the upper part of the house, exclaiming, in a furious
<lb />passion, <q>Dare say you have filched it for a dish&shy;
<lb />clout!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />She called out, however, <q>Are any of <persName>Mr. Brigg's</persName>
<lb />servant's below?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q><persName>Anan</persName>!</q> answered the boy, who came to the foot
<lb />of the stairs with a knife in one hand, and an old
<lb />shoe, upon the sole of which he was sharpening it, in
<lb />the other, <q>Does any one call?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q462" next="q463">Yes,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q463" prev="q462">I do; for I could not find
<lb />the bell.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q464" next="q465">O, we have no bell in the parlour,</q> returned the
<lb />boy, <q id="q465" prev="q464">master always knocks with his stick.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>I am afraid <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> is too busy to see me, and
<lb />if so, I will come another time.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q467" next="q468">No, ma'am,</q> said the boy, <q id="q468" prev="q467">master's only look&shy;

<p><lb /><q>Will you tell him, then, that I am waiting?</q></p>

<p>
<lb /><q>I has, ma'am; but master misses his shaving rag,
<lb />and he says he won't come to the Mogul till he's
<lb />found it.</q>  And then he went on with sharpening his
<lb />knife.</p>
<p><lb />This little circumstance was at least sufficient to
	  <lb />satisfy <persName>Cecilia</persName> that if she fixed her abode with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName>, she should not have much uneasiness to fear
<lb />from the sight of extravagance and profusion.</p>
<p><lb />She returned to the parlour, and after waiting
	  <lb />another half hour, <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> made his appearance.
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> was a short, thick, sturdy man, with very
<lb />small keen black eyes, a square face, a dark com&shy;
<lb />plexion, and a snub nose.  His constant dress, both
<lb />in winter and summer, was a snuff-colour suit of
<lb />cloaths, blue and white speckled worsted stockings, a
<lb />plain shirt, and a bob wig.  He was seldom without
<lb />a stick in his hand, which he usually held to his fore&shy;
<lb />head when not speaking.</p>
<p><lb />This bob wig, however, to the no small amaze&shy;
<lb />ment of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he now brought into the room upon
<lb />the forefinger of his left-hand, while, with his right,
<lb />he was smoothing the curls; and his head, in defiance
<lb />of the coldness of the weather, was bald and un&shy;
<lb />covered.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q469" next="q470">Well,</q> cried he, as he entered, <q id="q470" prev="q469">did you think
<lb />should not come?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I was very willing, Sir, to wait your leisure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ay, ay, knew you had not much to do.  Been
<lb />looking for my shaving-rag.  Going out of town;
<lb />never use such a thing at home, paper does as well.
	    <lb />Warrant master <persName>Harrel</persName> never heard of such a thing;
<lb />ever see him comb his own wig?  Warrant he don't
<lb />know how! never trust mine out of my hands, the

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">123</mw>
<lb />boy would tear off half the hair; all one to master
	    <lb /><persName>Harrel</persName>, I suppose.  Well, which is the warmer man,
<lb />that's all?  Will he cast an account with me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, at a loss what to say to this singular exor&shy;
<lb />dium, began an apology for not waiting upon him
<lb />sooner.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q471" next="q472">Ay, ay,</q> cried he, <q id="q472" prev="q471">always gadding, no getting
<lb />sight of you.  Live a fine life!  A pretty guardian
	    <lb />master <persName>Harrel</persName>! and where's t'other? where's old

<p>	  <lb /><q>If you mean <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, Sir, I have not yet seen
<lb />him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Thought so.  No matter:  as well not.  Only tell
	    <lb />you he's a German Duke, or a Spanish <name>Don Fer&shy;
<lb />dinand</name>.  Well you've me! poorly off else.  A couple
<lb />of ignoramussus! don't know when to buy nor when
<lb />to sell.  No doing business with either of them.  We
<lb />met once or twice; all to no purpose; only heard
	    <lb /><name>Don Vampus</name> count his old Grandees; how will that
	    <lb />get interest for money?  Then comes master <persName>Harrel</persName>,
<lb />&mdash;&mdash;twenty bows to a word,&mdash;looks at a watch,&sdash;
<lb />about as big as a sixpence,&mdash;poor raw ninny!&mdash;a
<lb />couple of rare guardians!  Well you've me, I say;
<lb />mind that!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was wholly unable to devise any answer to
<lb />these effusions of contempt and anger; and therefore
<lb />his harangue lasted without interruption, till he had
<lb />exhausted all his subjects of complaint, and emptied
<lb />his mind of ill-will; and then, settling his wig, he
<lb />drew a chair near her, and twinkling his little black
<lb />eyes in her face, his rage subsided into the most per&shy;
<lb />fect good-humour; and, after peeping at her some
<lb />time with a look of much approbation, he said, with
<pb n="128" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">124</mw>
<lb />an arch nod, <q>Well, my duck, got ever a sweet&shy;

<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> laughed, and said <q>No.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah, little rogue, don't believe you! all a fib!
<lb />better speak out:  come, fit I should know; a'n't you
<lb />my own ward? to be sure almost of age, but not quite,
<lb />so what's that to me?</q></p>
<p><lb />She then, more seriously, assured him she had no
<lb />intelligence of that sort to communicate.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, when you have, tell, that's all.  Warrant
<lb />sparks enough hankering.  I'll give you some advice.
<lb />Take care of sharpers; don't trust shoe-buckles, no&shy;
<lb />thing but Bristol stones! tricks in all things.  A fine
<lb />gentleman sharp as another man.  Never give your
<lb />heart to a gold-topped cane, nothing but brass gilt
<lb />over.  Cheats every where:  fleece you in a year;
<lb />won't leave you a groat.  But one way to be safe,&mdash;&mdash;
<lb />bring e'em all to me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for his caution, and promised
<lb />not to forget his advice.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q473" next="q474">That's the way,</q> he continued, <q id="q474" prev="q473">bring 'em to me.
<lb />Won't be bamboozled.  Know their tricks.  Shew
<lb />'em the odds on't.  Ask for the rent-roll,&mdash;see how
<lb />they'll look! stare like stuck pigs! got no such thing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Certainly, sir, that will be an excellent method of
<lb />trial.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ay, ay, know the way! soon find if they are above
<lb />par.  Be sure don't mind gold waistcoats:  nothing
<lb />but tinsel, all shew and no substance; better leave the
<lb />matter to me; take care of yourself; know where to
<lb />find one will do.</q></p>
<p><lb />She again thanked him; and, being fully satisfied
<lb />with this specimen of his conversation, and unambi&shy;
<pb n="129" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">125</mw>
<lb />tious of any further counsel from him, she arose to
<lb />depart.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q475" next="q476">Well,</q> repeated he, nodding at her with a look
<lb />of much kindness, <q id="q476" prev="q475">leave it to me, I say; I'll get you
<lb />a careful husband, so take no thought about the mat&shy;
<lb />ter.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, half laughing, begged he would not give
<lb />himself much trouble, and assured him she was not in
<lb />any haste.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q477" next="q478">All the better,</q> said he, <q id="q478" prev="q477">good girl; no fear for

<lb />very easy, neither; hard times! men scarce! wars
<lb />and tumults! stocks low! women chargeable!&mdash;&mdash;but
<lb />don't fear; do our best; get you off soon.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then returned to her carriage; full of reflection
<lb />upon the scene in which she had just been engaged,
<lb />and upon the strangeness of hastening from one house
<lb />to avoid a vice the very want of which seemed to ren&shy;
<lb />der another insupportable! but she now found that
<lb />though luxury was more baneful in its consequences,
<lb />it was less disgustful in its progress than avarice; yet,
<lb />insuperably averse to both, and almost equally desir&shy;
<lb />ous to fly from the unjust extravagance of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />as from the comfortless and unnecessary parsimony of
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, she proceeded instantly to <placeName>St. James's-
<lb />Square</placeName>, convinced that her third guardian, unless
<lb />exactly resembling one of the others, must inevitably
<lb />be preferable to both.</p>

<p>
	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> house of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> was grand and spacious,
<lb />fitted up not with modern taste, but with the magni&shy;
<lb />ficence of former times; the servants were all vete&shy;
<lb />rans, gorgeous in their liveries, and profoundly res&shy;
<lb />pectful in their manners; every thing had an air of
<lb />state, but of a state so gloomy, that while it inspired
<lb />awe, it repressed pleasure.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> sent in her name, and was admitted without
<lb />difficulty, and was then ushed with great pomp through
<lb />sundry apartments, and rows of servants, before she
	  <lb />came into the presence of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />He received her with an air of haughty affability,
<lb />which, to a spirit open and liberal as that of <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />could not fail being extremely offensive; but too much
<lb />occupied with the care of his own importance to pene&shy;
<lb />trate into the feelings of another, he attributed the
<lb />uneasiness which his reception occasioned, to the over&shy;
<lb />awing predominance of superior rank and conse&shy;
<lb />quence.</p>
<p><lb />He ordered a servant to bring her a chair, while
<lb />he only half rose from his own upon her entering into
<lb />the room; then, waving his hand and bowing, with a
<lb />motion that desired her to be seated, he said, <q>I am
<lb />very happy, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, that you have found me
<lb />alone; you would rarely have had the same good
<lb />fortune.  At this time of day I am generally in a
<pb n="131" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">127</mw>
<lb />crowd. People of large connections have not much
<lb />leisure in London, especially if they see a little after
<lb />their own affairs, and if their estates, like mine, are
<lb />dispersed in various parts of the kingdom.  However,
<lb />I am glad it happened so.  And I am glad, too, that
<lb />you have done me the favour of calling without wait&shy;
<lb />ing till I sent, which I really would have done as soon
<lb />as I heard of your arrival, but that the multiplicity of
<lb />my engagements allowed me no respite.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />A display of importance so ostentatious made <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName> already half repent her visit, satisfied that the
<lb />hope in which she had planned it would be fruitless.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, still imputing to embarrassment, an
<lb />inquietude of countenance that proceeded merely
<lb />from disappointment, imagined her veneration was
<lb />every moment encreasing; and therefore, pitying a
<lb />timidity which both gratified and softened him, and
<lb />equally pleased with himself for inspiring, and with
<lb />her for feeling it, he abated more and more of his
<lb />greatness, till he became, at length, so infinitely con&shy;
<lb />descending, with intention to give her courage, that
<lb />he totally depressed her with mortification and cha&shy;
<lb />grin.</p>
<p><lb />After some general enquiries concerning her way
<lb />of life, he told her that he hoped she was contented
	  <lb />with her situation at the <name>Harrels</name>, adding, <q>If you
<lb />have any thing to complain of, remember to whom you
	    <lb />may appeal.</q>  He then asked if she had seen <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName>?</p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, Sir, I am this moment come from his house.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am sorry for it; his house cannot be a proper
<lb />one for the reception of a young lady.  When the
<lb />Dean made application that I would be one of your
<pb n="132" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">128</mw>
<lb />guardians, I instantly sent him a refusal, as is my cus&shy;
<lb />tom upon all such occasions, which indeed occur to
<lb />me with a frequency extremely importunate; but the
<lb />Dean was a man for whom I had really a regard, and
<lb />therefore, when I found my refusal had affected him,
<lb />I suffered myself to be prevailed upon to indulge him,
<lb />contrary not only to my general rule, but to my incli&shy;
<lb />nation.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here he stopt, as if to receive some compliment;
<lb />but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, very little disposed to pay him any, went
<lb />no farther than an inclination of
<lb />the head.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q479" next="q480">I knew not, however,</q> he continued, <q id="q480" prev="q479">at the
<lb />time I was induced to give my consent, with whom I
<lb />was to be associated; nor could I have imagined the
<lb />Dean so little conversant with the distinctions of the
<lb />world, as to disgrace me with inferior coadjutors; but
<lb />the moment I learnt the state of the affair, I insisted
<lb />upon withdrawing both my name and countenance.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here again he paused; not in expectation of an an&shy;
<lb />swer from <persName>Cecilia</persName>, but merely to give her time to
<lb />marvel in what manner he had at last been melted.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q481" next="q482">The Dean,</q> he resumed, <q id="q482" prev="q481">was then very ill; my
<lb />displeasure, I believe, hurt him.  I was sorry for it;
<lb />he was a worthy man, and had not meant to offend
<lb />me; in the end I accepted his apology, and was even
<lb />persuaded to accept the office.  You have a right,
<lb />therefore, to consider yourself as <emph>personally</emph> my ward:
<lb />and though I do not think proper to mix much with
<lb />your other guardians, I shall always be ready to serve
<lb />and advise you, and much pleased to see you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You do me honour, sir;</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely
<lb />wearied of such graciousness, and rising to be gone.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q483" next="q484">Pray sit still,</q> said he, with a smile; <q id="q484" prev="q483">I have

<lb />not many engagements for this morning.  You must
<lb />give me some account how you pass your time.  Are
<lb />you much out?  The Harrels, I am told, live at a
<lb />great expence.  What is their establishment?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I don't exactly know, sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>They are decent sort of people, I believe; are
<lb />they not?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope so, sir!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And they have a tolerable acquaintance, I believe:
<lb />I am told so; for I know nothing of them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>They have, at least, a very numerous one, sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q485" next="q486">Well, my dear,</q> said he, taking her hand, <q id="q486" prev="q485">now
<lb />you have once ventured to come, don't be appre&shy;
<lb />hensive of repeating your visits; I must introduce
	    <lb />you to <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>; I am sure she will be happy to
<lb />shew you any kindness.  Come, therefore, when you
<lb />please, and without scruple.  I would call upon you
<lb />myself, but am fearful of being embarrassed by the
<lb />people with whom you live.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then rang his bell, and with the same ceremonies
<lb />which had attended her admittance, she was conducted
<lb />back to her carriage.</p>
<p><lb />And here died away all hope of putting into exe&shy;
<lb />cution, during her minority, the plan of which the
<lb />formation had given her so much pleasure.  She
<lb />found that her present situation, however wide of her
<lb />wishes, was by no means the most disagreeable in
<lb />which she could be placed; she was tired, indeed, of
<lb />dissipation, and shocked at the sight of unfeeling ex&shy;
<lb />travagance; but notwithstanding the houses of each
<lb />of her other guardians were exempt from these parti&shy;
<lb />cular vices, she saw not any prospect of happiness with
<lb />either of them; vulgarity seemed leagued with a&shy;

	  <lb />varice to drive her from the mansion of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>,
<lb />and haughtiness with ostentation to exclude her from
	  <lb />that of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb />She came back, therefore, to <placeName>Portman-Square</placeName>, dis&shy;
<lb />appointed in her hopes, and sick both of those whom
<lb />she quitted, and of those to whom she was returning;
<lb />but in going to her own apartment, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />eagerly stopping her, begged she would come into the
<lb />drawing-room, where she promised her a most agree&shy;
<lb />able surprise.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, for an instant, imagined that some old ac&shy;
<lb />quaintance was just arrived out of the country; but,
<lb />upon her entrance, she saw only <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and some
<lb />workmen, and found that the agreeable surprise was
<lb />to proceed from the sight of an elegant Awning, pre&shy;
<lb />pared for one of the inner apartments, to be fixed
<lb />over a long desert-table, which was to be ornamented
<lb />with various devices of cut glass.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q487" next="q488">Did you ever see any thing so beautiful in your
<lb />life?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q id="q488" prev="q487">and when the table is
<lb />covered with the coloured ices, and those sort of
<lb />things, it will be as beautiful again.  We shall have
	    <lb />it ready for <name>Tuesday</name> se'nnight.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I understood you were engaged to go to the Mas&shy;
<lb />querade?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>So we shall; only we intend to see masks at home
<lb />first.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q489" next="q490">I have some thoughts,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, leading
<lb />the way to another small room, <q id="q490" prev="q489">of running up a
<lb />flight of steps, and a little light gallery here, and so
<lb />making a little Orchestra.  What would such a thing
	    <lb />come to, <persName>Mr. Tomkins</persName>?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q491" next="q492">O, a trifle, sir,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Tomkins</persName>, <q id="q492" prev="q491">a mere
<lb />nothing.</q></p>
<pb n="135" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">131</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>Well, then, give orders for it, and let it be done
<lb />directly.  I don't care how slight it is, but pray let it
	    <lb />be very elegant.  Won't it be a great addition, <persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed, sir, I don't think it seems to be very ne&shy;
<lb />cessary,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; who wished much to take that
<lb />moment for reminding him of the debt he had con&shy;
<lb />tracted with <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q493" next="q494">Lord, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> is so grave!</q> cried <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, <q id="q494" prev="q493">nothing of this sort gives her any pleasure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q495" next="q496">She has, indeed,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, trying to
<lb />smile, <q id="q496" prev="q495">not much taste for the pleasure of being al&shy;
<lb />ways surrounded by workmen.</q></p>
<p><lb />And, as soon as she was able, she retired to her
<lb />room, feeling, both on the part of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> and the
	  <lb /><name>Hills</name>, a resentment at the injustice of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />which fixed her in the resolution of breaking through
<lb />that facility of compliance, which had hitherto con&shy;
<lb />fined her disapprobation to her own breast, and ven&shy;
<lb />turing, henceforward, to mark the opinion she enter&shy;
<lb />tained of his conduct, by consulting nothing but reason
<lb />and principle in her own.</p>
<p><lb />Her first effort towards this change was made im&shy;
<lb />mediately, in begging to be excused from accompa&shy;
<lb />nying <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to a large card assembly that
<lb />evening.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, extremely surprised, asked a thousand
<lb />times the reason of her refusal, imagining it to proceed
<lb />from some very extraordinary cause; nor was she,
<lb />without the utmost difficulty, persuaded at last that
<lb />she merely meant to pass one evening by herself.</p>
<p><lb />But the next day, when the refusal was repeated,
<lb />she was still more incredulous; it seemed to her im&shy;
<pb n="136" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">132</mw>
<lb />possible that any one who had the power to be in&shy;
<lb />circled with company, could by choice spend a second
<lb />afternoon alone; and she was so urgent in her re&shy;
<lb />quest to be entrusted with the secret, that <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />found no way left to appease her, but by frankly con&shy;
<lb />fessing she was weary of eternal visiting, and sick of
<lb />living always in a crowd.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q497" next="q498">Suppose, then,</q> cried she, <q id="q498" prev="q497">I send for <persName>Miss La&shy;
<lb />rolles</persName> to come and sit with you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, not without laughing, declined this proposal,
<lb />assuring her that no such assistant was necessary for
<lb />her entertainment: yet it was not till after a long
<lb />contention that she was able to convince her there
<lb />would be no cruelty in leaving her by herself.</p>
<p><lb />The following day, however, her trouble dimi&shy;
<lb />nished; for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, ceasing to be suprised,
<lb />thought little more of the matter, and forbore any
<lb />earnestness of solicitation; and from that time, she
<lb />suffered her to follow her own humour with very little
<lb />opposition.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> was much concerned to find her
<lb />so unmoved; and not less disappointed at the indif&shy;
<lb />ference of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who, being seldom of the same
<lb />parties with his lady, and seeing her too rarely either
<lb />to communicate or hear any domestic occurences, far
<lb />from being struck, as she had hoped, with the new
<lb />way in which she passed her time, was scarce sen&shy;
<lb />sible of the change, and interfered not upon the sub&shy;
<lb />jeet.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, who continued to see her when
	  <lb />he dined in <placeName>Portman-Square</placeName>, often enquired what she
<lb />did with herself in an evening; but never obtaining
<lb />any satisfactory answer, he concluded her engage&shy;
<lb />ments were with people to whom he was a stranger.</p>
<pb n="137" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">133</mw>
<p>
<lb />Poor <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> felt the cruellest disappointment
<lb />in being deprived of the happiness of attending her in
<lb />her evening's expeditions, when, whether he con&shy;
<lb />versed with her or not, he was sure of the indulgence
<lb />of seeing and hearing her.</p>
<p><lb />But the greatest sufferer from this new regulation
<lb />was <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who, unable any longer to endure
<lb />the mortifications of which his morning visits to
	  <lb /><placeName>Portman-Square</placeName> had been productive, determined not
<lb />to trust his temper with such provocations in future,
<lb />but rather to take his chance of meeting with her
<lb />elsewhere: for which purpose, he assiduously fre&shy;
<lb />quented all public places, and sought acquaintance
<lb />with every family and every person he believed to be
	  <lb />known to the <name>Harrels</name>: but his patience was unre&shy;
<lb />warded, and his diligence unsuccessful; he met with
<lb />her no where, and, while he continued his search, fan&shy;
<lb />cied every evil power was at work to lead him whi&shy;
<lb />ther he was sure never to find her.</p>
<p><lb />Meanwhile <persName>Cecilia</persName> passed her time greatly to her
<lb />own satisfaction.  Her first care was to assist and
	  <lb />comfort the <name>Hills</name>.  She went herself to their lodgings,
<lb />ordered and paid for whatever the physician prescribed
<lb />to the sick man, gave clothes to the children, and
<lb />money and various necessaries to the wife.  She found
<lb />that the poor carpenter was not likely to languish
<lb />much longer, and therefore, for the present, only
<lb />thought of alleviating his sufferings, by procuring him
<lb />such indulgences as were authorised by his physician,
<lb />and enabling his family to abate so much of their la&shy;
<lb />bour as was requisite for obtaining time to nurse and
<lb />attend him: but she meant, as soon as the last duties
<lb />should be paid him, to assist his survivors in at&shy;
<pb n="138" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">134</mw>
<lb />tempting to follow some better and more profitable
<lb />business.</p>
<p><lb />Her next solicitude was to furnish herself with a
<lb />well-chosen collection of books; and this employment,
<lb />which to a lover of literature, young and ardent in its
<lb />pursuit, is perhaps the mind's first luxury, proved a
<lb />source of entertainment so fertile and delightful that
<lb />it left her nothing to wish.</p>
<p><lb />She confined not her acquisitions to the limits of
<lb />her present power, but, as she was laying in a stock
<lb />for future as well as immediate advantage, she was
<lb />restrained by no expence from gratifying her taste and
<lb />her inclination.  She had now entered the last year
<lb />of her minority, and therefore had not any doubt that
<lb />her guardians would permit her to take up whatever
<lb />sum she should require for such a purpose.</p>
<p><lb />And thus, in the exercise of charity, the search of
<lb />knowledge, and the enjoyment of quiet, serenely in
<lb />innocent philosophy passed the hours of <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>

	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> first check this tranquillity received was upon
<lb />the day of the masquerade, the preparations for which
<lb />have been already mentioned.  The whole house was
<lb />then in commotion, from various arrangements and

<milestone unit="sig" n="R4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">135</mw>
<lb />improvements which were planned for almost every
<lb />apartment that was to be opened for the reception of
<lb />masks.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> herself, however little pleased with
<lb />the attendant circumstance of wantonly accumulating
<lb />unnecessary debts, was not the least animated of the
<lb />party; she was a stranger to every diversion of this
<lb />sort, and from the novelty of the scene, hoped for un&shy;
<lb />common satisfaction.</p>
<p><lb />At noon <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> sent for her to consult upon a
<lb />new scheme which occurred to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, of fixing in
<lb />fantastic forms some coloured lamps in the drawing&shy;
<lb />room.</p>
<p><lb />While they were all discoursing this matter over,
<lb />one of the servants, who had two or three times whis&shy;
<lb />pered some message to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and then retired,
<lb />said, in a voice not too low to be heard by <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>Indeed, Sir, I can't get him away.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q499" next="q500">He's an insolent scoundrel,</q> answered Mr. Har&shy;
<lb />rel; <q id="q500" prev="q499">however, if I must speak to him, I must;</q> and
<lb />went out of the room.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> still continued to exercise her fancy
<lb />upon this new project, calling upon both <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb />and <persName>Cecilia</persName> to admire her taste and contrivance; till
<lb />they were all interrupted by the loudness of a voice
<lb />from below stairs, which frequently repeated, <q>Sir, I
<lb />can wait no longer!  I have been put off till I can be
<lb />put off no more!</q></p>
<p><lb />Startled by this, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> ceased her employ&shy;
<lb />ment, and they all stood still and silent.  They then
<lb />heard <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> with much softness answer, <q>Good
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Rawlins</persName> have a little patience; I shall receive a
<lb />large sum of money to-morrow, or next day, and you
<lb />may then depend upon being paid.</q></p>

<lb /><q id="q501" next="q502">Sir,</q> cried the man, <q id="q502" prev="q501">you have so often told me
<lb />the same, that it goes just for nothing; I have had a

<lb />that can't be waited for any longer.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q503" next="q504">Certainly, <persName>Mr. Rawlins</persName>,</q> replied <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />with still increasing gentleness, <q id="q504" prev="q503">and certainly you

<lb />employ any body else, and I shall have occasion for
<lb />you very soon, as I intend to make some alterations
<lb />at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName> that will be very considerable.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q505" next="q506">Sir,</q> said the man, still louder, <q id="q506" prev="q505">it is of no use
<lb />your employing me, if I can never get my money: All
<lb />my workmen must be paid whether I am or no; and
<lb />so, if I must needs speak to a lawyer, why there's no
<lb />help for it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q507" next="q508">Did you ever hear any thing so impertinent?</q> ex&shy;

<lb />very much to blame, if ever he lets that man do any
<lb />thing more for him.</q></p>
<p><lb />Just then <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> appeared, and, with an air of
<lb />affected unconcern, said, <q>Here's the most insolent
<lb />rascal of a mason below stairs I ever met with in my
<lb />life; he has come upon me, quite unexpectedly, with
<lb />a bill of 400<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. and won't leave the house without the

<lb />favour to speak to the fellow, for I could not bear to
<lb />stay with him any longer.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Do you wish me to give him a draught for the
<lb />money upon my own banker?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q509" next="q510">That would be vastly obliging,</q> answered <persName>Mr.

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">137</mw>
<lb />Harrel</persName>, <q id="q510" prev="q509">and I will give you my note for it directly.
<lb />And so we shall get rid of this fellow at once: and he
<lb />shall do nothing more for me as long as he lives.  I
<lb />will run up a new building at <placeName>Violet-Bank</placeName> next
<lb />summer, if only to shew him what a job he has lost.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q511" next="q512">Pay the man at once, there's a good brother,</q>
<lb />cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q id="q512" prev="q511">and let's hear no more of him.</q></p>
<p><lb />The two gentlemen then retired to another room,
<lb />and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, after praising the extreme good-na&shy;
<lb />ture of her brother, of whom she was very fond, and
<lb />declaring that the mason's impertinence had quite
<lb />frightened her, again returned to her plan of new de&shy;
<lb />corations.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, amazed at this indifference to the state of
<lb />her husband's affairs, began to think it was her own
<lb />duty to talk with her upon the subject: and therefore,
<lb />after a silence so marked that <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> enquired
<lb />into its reason, she said, <q>Will you pardon me, my
<lb />dear friend, if I own I am rather surprised to see you
<lb />continue these preparations?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord, why?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Because any fresh unnecessary expences just now,
<lb />till <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> actually receives the money he talks
<lb />of&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, my dear, the expence of such a thing as this
<lb />is nothing; in <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s affairs I assure you it
<lb />will not be at all felt.  Besides, he expects money so
<lb />soon, that it is just the same as if he had it already.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, unwilling to be too officious, began then to
<lb />express her admiration of the goodness and generosity
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, taking frequent occasion, in the course
<lb />of her praise, to insinuate that those only can be pro&shy;
<lb />perly liberal, who are just and &oelig;conomical.</p>

<p>
<lb />She had prepared no masquerade habit for this
<lb />evening, as <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, by whose direction she was
<lb />guided, informed her it was not necessary for ladies
<lb />to be masked at home, and said she should receive her
<lb />company herself in a dress which she might wear upon
	  <lb />any other occasion.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, also, and <persName>Mr. Ar&shy;
<lb />nott</persName>, made not any alteration in their appearance.</p>
<p><lb />At about eight o'clock the business of the evening
<lb />began; and before nine, there were so many masks
<lb />that <persName>Cecilia</persName> wished she had herself made one of the
<lb />number, as she was far more conspicuous in being al&shy;
<lb />most the only female in a common dress, than any
<lb />masquerade habit could have made her.  The novelty
<lb />of the scene, however, joined to the general air of
<lb />gaiety diffused throughout the company, shortly les&shy;
<lb />sened her embarrassment; and after being somewhat
<lb />familiarized to the abruptness with which the masks
<lb />approached her, and the freedom with which they
<lb />looked at or addressed her, the first confusion of her
<lb />situation subsided, and in her curiosity to watch
<lb />others, she ceased to observe how much she was
<lb />watched herself.</p>
<p><lb />Her expectations of entertainment were not only
<lb />fulfilled but surpassed; the variety of dresses, the
<lb />medley of characters, the quick succession of figures,
<lb />and the ludicrous mixture of groupes, kept her atten&shy;
<lb />tion unwearied; while the conceited efforts at wit, the
<lb />total thoughtlessness of consistency, and the ridiculous
<lb />incongruity of the language with the appearance, were
<lb />incitements to surprise and diversion without end.
<lb />Even the local cant of, <emph>Do you know me?  Who are
<lb />you?</emph> and <emph>I know you;</emph> with the sly pointing of the
<lb />finger, the arch nod of the head, and the pert squeak
<pb n="143" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">139</mw>
<lb />of the voice, though wearisome to those who frequent
<lb />such assemblies, were, to her unhackneyed observa&shy;
<lb />tion, additional subjects of amusement.</p>
<p><lb />Soon after nine o'clock, every room was occupied,
<lb />and the common crowd of regular masqueraders were
<lb />dispersed through the various apartments.  Dominos
<lb />of no character, and fancy-dresses of no meaning,
<lb />made, as is usual at such meetings, the general herd
	  <lb />of the company; for the rest, the men were <name>Spaniards</name>,
	  <lb />chimney-sweepers, <name>Turks</name>, watchmen, conjurers, and
<lb />old women; and the ladies, shepherdesses, orange
	  <lb />girls, <name>Circassians</name>, gipseys, haymakers, and sultanas.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> had, as yet, escaped any address beyond the
<lb />customary enquiry of <emph>Do you know me?</emph> and a few
<lb />passing compliments; but when the rooms filled, and
<lb />the general crowd gave general courage, she was at&shy;
<lb />tacked in a manner more pointed and singular.</p>
<p><lb />The very first mask who approached her, seemed
<lb />to have nothing less in view than preventing the ap&shy;
<lb />proach of every other: yet had he little reason to hope
<lb />favour for himself, as the person he represented, of
<lb />all others least alluring to the view, was the devil!
<lb />He was black from head to foot, save that two red
<lb />horns seemed to issue from his forehead; his face was
<lb />so completely covered, that the sight only of his eyes
<lb />was visible, his feet were cloven, and in his right hand
<lb />he held a wand the colour of fire.</p>
<p><lb />Waving this wand as he advanced towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />he cleared a semi-circular space before her chair,
<lb />thrice with the most profound reverence bowed to
<lb />her, thrice turned himself around with sundry gri&shy;
<lb />maces, and then fiercely planted himself at her side.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was amused by his mummery, but felt no
<pb n="144" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">140</mw>
<lb />great delight in his guardianship, and, after a short
<lb />time, arose, with intention to walk to another place;
<lb />but the black gentleman, adroitly moving round her,
<lb />held out his hand to obstruct her passage, and there&shy;
<lb />fore, preferring captivity to resistance, she was
<lb />again obliged to seat herself.</p>
<p>	  <lb />An <name>Hotspur</name>, who just then made his appearance,
<lb />was now strutting boldly towards her; but the devil,
<lb />rushing furiously forwards, placed himself immediately
	  <lb />between them.  <persName>Hotspur</persName>, putting his arms a-kembo
<lb />with an air of defiance, give a loud stamp with his
<lb />right foot, and then&mdash;&mdash;marched into another room.</p>
<p><lb />The victorious devil ostentatiously waved his wand,
<lb />and returned to his station.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who had never moved two yards from
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, knowing her too well to suppose she received
<lb />any pleasure from being thus distinguished, modestly
<lb />advanced to offer his assistance in releasing her from
<lb />confinement; but the devil, again describing a circle
<lb />with his wand, gave him three such smart raps on
<lb />the head, that his hair was disordered, and his face
<lb />covered with powder.  A general laugh succeeded;
<lb />and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, too diffident to brave railery, or
<lb />withstand shame, retired in confusion.</p>
<p><lb />The black gentleman seemed now to have all au&shy;
<lb />thority in his own hands, and his wand was brandished
<lb />with more ferocity than ever, no one again venturing
<lb />to invade the domain he thought fit to appropriate for
<lb />his own.</p>
<p>	  <lb />At length, however, a <persName>Don Quixote</persName> appeared, and
<lb />every mask in the room was eager to point out to him
<lb />the imprisonment of <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb />This <persName>Don Quixote</persName> was accoutred with tolerable
<pb n="145" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">141</mw>
<lb />exactness, according to the description of the admi&shy;
	  <lb />rable <persName>Cervantes;</persName> his armour was rusty, his helmet
<lb />was a barber's bason, his shield a pewter dish, and
<lb />his lance an old sword fastened to a slim cane.  His
<lb />figure, tall and thin, was well adapted to the character
<lb />he represented; and his mask, which depictured a
<lb />lean and haggard face, worn with care, yet fiery with
<lb />crazy passions, exhibited, with propriety the most
<lb />striking, the knight of the doleful countenance.</p>
<p><lb />The complaints against the devil, with which imme&shy;
<lb />diately and from all quarters he was assailed, he heard
<lb />with the most solemn taciturnity: after which, making
<lb />a motion for general silence, he stalked majestically
<lb />towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>, but stopping short of the limits pre&shy;
<lb />scribed by her guard, he kissed his spear in token of
<lb />allegiance, and then, slowly dropping upon one knee,
<lb />began the following address;
<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()" id="q513" next="q514">Most incomparable Princess!</q></p>

<lb />your high and tender grace, to salute the fair boards,
<lb />which sustain your corporeal machine.</q></p>
<p><lb />Then, bending down his head, he kissed the floor;
<lb />after which, raising himself upon his feet, he proceeded
<lb />in his speech.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Report, O most fair and unmatchable virgin!
<lb />daringly affirmeth, that a certain discourteous person,
<lb />who calleth himself the devil, even now, and in thwart
<lb />of your fair inclinations, keepeth and detaineth your
<lb />irradiant frame in hostile thraldom.  Suffer then,
<lb />magnanimous and undescribable lady! that I, the

<lb />which haply supports your terrestrial perfections, con&shy;
<lb />taineth the inimitable burthen with the free and legal
<lb />consent of your celestial spirit?</q></p>
<p><lb />Here he ceased; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who laughed at this
<lb />characteristic address, though she had not courage to
<lb />answer it, again made an effort to quit her place, but
<lb />again by the wand of her black persecutor was pre&shy;
<lb />vented.</p>
<p><lb />This little incident was answer sufficient for the
<lb />valorous knight, who indignantly exclaimed,
<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()" id="q515" next="q516">Sublime Lady!</q></p>

<p><lb />Then, bowing low, he turned from her, and thus
<lb />addressed his intended antagonist;
<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()" id="q517" next="q518">Uncourtly Miscreant,</q></p>

<lb />honour of knighthood, dubbing thee, by my own
<lb />sword, Don Devil, knight of the horrible physiog&shy;
<lb />nomy.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then attempted to strike his shoulder with his
<lb />spear, but the black gentleman, adroitly eluding the
<lb />blow, defended himself with his wand; a mock fight
<lb />ensued, conducted on both sides with admirable dex&shy;
<lb />terity; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, less eager to view it than to be&shy;
<lb />come again a free agent, made her escape into another
<lb />apartment; while the rest of the ladies, though they
<lb />almost all screamed, jumped upon chairs and sofas to
<lb />peep at the combat.</p>
<p><lb />In conclusion, the wand of the knight of the hor&shy;
<lb />rible physiognomy, was broken against the shield of
<lb />the knight of the doleful countenance; upon which
	  <lb /><persName>Don Quixote</persName> called out <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()" lang="spa">victoria!</q>  The whole room
<lb />echoed the sound; the unfortunate new knight retired
<lb />abruptly into another apartment; and the conquering
<lb />Don, seizing the fragments of the weapon of his van&shy;
<lb />quished enemy, went out in search of the lady for
<lb />whose releasement he had fought: and the moment
<lb />he found her, prostrating both himself and the tro&shy;
<lb />phies at her feet, he again pressed the floor with his
<lb />lips; and then, slowly arising, repeated his reverences
<lb />with added formality, and, without waiting her ac&shy;
<lb />knowledgements, gravely retired.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The moment he departed, a <name>Minerva</name>, not stately
<lb />nor austere, not marching in warlike majesty, but gay
<lb />and airy,</p>

<pb n="148" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">144</mw>
<lb />ran up to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and squeaked out, <q>Do you know
<lb />me?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q519" next="q520">Not,</q> answered she, instantly recollecting <persName>Miss
<lb />Larolles</persName>, <q id="q520" prev="q519">by your <emph>appearance</emph>, I own; but by your
<lb /><emph>voice</emph>, I think I can guess you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q521" next="q522">I was monstrous sorry,</q> returned the goddess,
<lb />without understanding this distinction, <q id="q522" prev="q521">that I was
<lb />not at home wh<sic corr="e">o</sic>n you called upon me.  Pray how do
<lb />you like my dress?  I assure you I think it's the pret&shy;
<lb />tiest here.  But do you know there's the most shock&shy;
<lb />ing thing in the world happened in the next room?
<lb />I really believe there's a common chimney-sweeper got
<lb />in!  I assure you it's enough to frighten one to death,
<lb />for every time he moves, the soot smells so you can't
<lb />think; quite real soot, I assure you! only conceive
<lb />how nasty!  I declare I wish with all my heart it would
<lb />suffocate him!</q></p>
<p><lb />Here she was interrupted by the re-appearance of
<lb /><mcr>Don Devil;</mcr>  who, looking around him, and perceiv&shy;
<lb />ing that his antagonist was gone, again advanced to
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>; not, however, with the authority of his first
<lb />approach, for with his wand he had lost much of his
<lb />power; but to recompence himself for this disgrace, he
<lb />had recourse to another method equally effectual for
<lb />keeping his prey to himself, for he began a growling,
<lb />so dismal and disagreeable, that while many of the
<lb />ladies, and, among the first, the <mcr>Goddess of Wisdom
<lb />and Courage,</mcr> ran away to avoid him, the men all stood
<lb />aloof, to watch what next was to follow.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now became seriously uneasy; for she was
<lb />made an object of general attention, yet could neither
<lb />speak nor be spoken to.  She could suggest no motive
<lb />for behaviour so whimsical, though she imagined the
<pb n="149" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">145</mw>
<lb />only person who could have the assurance to practise
<lb />it was <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />After some time spent thus disagreeably, a white
<lb />domino, who for a few minutes had been a very at&shy;
<lb />tentive spectator, suddenly came forward, and ex&shy;
<lb />claiming, <q id="q523" next="q524" rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post(&amp;rdquo;)slant(italic)">I'll cross him though he blast me!</q>
<lb />rushed upon the fiend, and grasping one of his horns,
<lb />called out to a Harlequin who stood near him, <q id="q524" prev="q523">Har&shy;
<lb />lequin! do you fear to fight the devil?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Not I, truly,</q> answered <name>Harlequin</name>, whose voice
<lb />immediately betrayed young <persName>Morrice</persName>, and who, is&shy;
<lb />suing from the crowd, whirled himself round before
<lb />the black gentleman with yet more agility than he
<lb />had himself done before <persName>Cecilia</persName>, giving him, from
<lb />time to time, many smart blows on his shoulders,
<lb />head and back, with his wooden sword.</p>
<p><lb />The rage of <mcr>Don Devil</mcr> at this attack seemed some&shy;
<lb />what beyond what a masquerade character rendered
<lb />necessary; he foamed at the mouth with resentment,
<lb />and defended himself with so much vehemence, that
	  <lb />he soon drove poor <name>Harlequin</name> into another room;
<lb />but, when he would have returned to his prey, the
<lb />genius of pantomime, curbed, but not subdued, at the
<lb />instigation of the white domino, returned to the
<lb />charge, and by a perpetual rotation of attack and re&shy;
<lb />treat, kept him in constant employment, pursuing
<lb />him from room to room, and teazing him without ces&shy;
<lb />sation or mercy.</p>
<p><lb />Mean time <persName>Cecilia</persName>, delighted at being released, hur&shy;
<lb />ried into a corner, where she hoped to breathe and
<lb />look on in quiet; and the white domino, having ex&shy;
<lb />horted Harlequin to torment the tormentor, and keep

<lb />him at bay, followed her with congratulations upon
<lb />her recovered freedom.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q525" next="q526">It is you,</q> answered she, <q id="q526" prev="q525">I ought to thank for
<lb />it, which indeed I do most heartily.  I was so tired
<lb />of confinement, that my mind seemed almost as little
<lb />at liberty as my person.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q527" next="q528">Your persecutor, I presume,</q> said the domino,
<lb /><q id="q528" prev="q527">is known to you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q529" next="q530">I hope so,</q> answered she, <q id="q530" prev="q529">because there is one
<lb />man I suspect, and I should be sorry to find there was
<lb />another equally disagreeable.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q531" next="q532">O, depend upon it,</q> cried he, <q id="q532" prev="q531">there are many
<lb />who would be happy to confine you in the same man&shy;
<lb />ner; neither have you much cause for complaint;
<lb />you have, doubtless, been the aggressor, and played
<lb />this game yourself without mercy, for I read in your
<lb />face the captivity of thousands; have you, then, any
<lb />right to be offended at the spirit of retaliation which
<lb />one, out of such numbers, has courage to exert in
<lb />return?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q533" next="q534">I protest,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q534" prev="q533">I took you for my
<lb />defender! whence is it you are become my accuser?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>From seeing the danger to which my incautious
<lb />knight errantry has exposed me; I begin, indeed, to
<lb />take you for a very mischievious sort of person; and
<lb />I fear the poor devil from whom I rescued you, will
<lb />be amply revenged for his disgrace, by finding that
<lb />the first use you make of your freedom, is to doom
<lb />your deliverer to bondage.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here they were disturbed by the extreme loquacity
<lb />of two opposite parties; and listening attentively,
<lb />they heard from one side, <q>My angel! fairest of
<pb n="151" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">147</mw>
<lb />creatures! goddess of my heart!</q> uttered in accents
<lb />of rapture; while from the other, the vociferation
<lb />was so violent, they could distinctly hear nothing.</p>
<p><lb />The white domino satisfied his curiosity by going to
<lb />both parties; and then, returning to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, said,
<lb /><q>Can you conjecture who was making those soft
	    <lb />speeches? a <name>Shylock</name>! his knife all the time in his
<lb />hand, and his design, doubtless, to <emph>cut as near the
<lb />heart as possible!</emph> while the loud cackling from the
<lb />other side, is owing to the riotous merriment of a
<lb />noisy Mentor!  When next I hear a disturbance, I
	    <lb />shall expect to see some simpering <persName>Pythagoras</persName> stunned
<lb />by his talkative disciples.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q535" next="q536">To own the truth,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q536" prev="q535">the almost
<lb />universal neglect of the characters assumed by these
<lb />masquers, has been the chief source of my entertain&shy;
<lb />ment this evening; for at a place of this sort, the
<lb />next best thing to a character well supported, is a
<lb />character ridiculously burlesqued.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q537" next="q538">You cannot, then, have wanted amusement,</q>
<lb />returned the domino; <q id="q538" prev="q537">for among all the persons
<lb />assembled in these apartments, I have seen only three
<lb />who have seemed conscious that any change but that
<lb />of dress was necessary to disguise them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And pray who are those?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>A <persName>Don Quixote</persName>, a school-master, and your friend
<lb />the devil.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q539" next="q540">O call him not my friend!</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb /><q id="q540" prev="q539">for indeed in or out of that garb he is particularly
<lb />my aversion.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q541" next="q542"><mcr>My</mcr> friend, then, I will call him,</q> said the
<lb />domino; <q id="q542" prev="q541">for so, were he ten devils, I must think
<lb />him, since I owe him the honour of conversing with
<pb n="152" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">148</mw>
<lb />you.  And, after all, to give him his due, to which,
<lb />you know, he is even proverbially entitled, he has
<lb />shewn such abilities in the performance of his part, so
<lb />much skill in the display of malice, and so much per&shy;
<lb />severance in the art of tormenting, that I cannot but
<lb />respect his ingenuity and capacity.  And, indeed, if
<lb />instead of an evil genius, he had represented a guar&shy;
<lb />dian angel, he could not have shewn a more refined
<lb />taste in his choice of an object to hover about.</q></p>
<p><lb />Just then they were approached by a young hay&shy;
<lb />maker, to whom the white domino called out, <q>You
<lb />look as gay and as brisk as if fresh from the hay-field,
<lb />after only half a day's work.  Pray how is it you
<lb />pretty lasses find employment for the winter?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q543" next="q544">How?</q> cried she, pertly; <q id="q544" prev="q543">why the same as for
<lb />the summer!</q>  And pleased with her own readiness
<lb />at repartee, without feeling the ignorance it betrayed,
<lb />she tript lightly on.</p>
<p><lb />Immediately after, the school-master, mentioned
<lb />by the white domino, advanced to <persName>Cecilia</persName>.  His dress
<lb />was merely a long wrapping gown of green stuff, a
<lb /><sic corr="">a </sic>pair of red slippers, and a woolen night cap of the
<lb />same colour; while, as the symbol of his profession,
<lb />he held a rod in his hand.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q545" next="q546">Ah, fair lady,</q> he cried, <q id="q546" prev="q545">how soothing were it

<lb />for such corruption of taste!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q549" next="q550">This repulse,</q> answered he, <q id="q550" prev="q549">is just what I
<lb />feared; for alas! under what pretence could a poor
<lb />miserable pedagogue presume to approach you?
<lb />Should I examine you in the dead languages, would
<lb />not your living accents charm from me all power of
<lb />reproof?  Could I look at you, and hear a false con&shy;
<lb />cord?  Should I doom you to water-gruel as a dunce,
<lb />would not my subsequent remorse make me want it
<lb />myself as a madman? Were your fair hand spread
<lb />out to me for correction, should I help applying my
<lb />lips to it, instead of my rat-tan?  If I ordered you to
<lb />be <emph>called up</emph>, should I ever remember to have you
<lb />sent back?  And if I commanded you to stand in a
<lb />corner, how should I forbear following you thither
<lb />myself?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had no difficulty in knowing this pre&shy;
<lb />tended school-master for <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, was readily
<lb />beginning to propose conditions, for according him
<lb />her favour, when their ears were assailed by a forced
<lb />phthisical cough, which they found proceeded from
<lb />an apparent old woman, who was a young man in
<lb />disguise, and whose hobbling gait, grunting voice,
<lb />and most greivous asthmatic complaints, seemed
<lb />greatly enjoyed and applauded by the company.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q551" next="q552">How true is it, yet how inconsistent,</q> cried the
<lb />white domino, <q id="q552" prev="q551">that while we all desire to live long,
<lb />we have all a horror of being old!  The figure now
<lb />passing is not meant to ridicule any particular person,

<lb />view is to expose to contempt and derision the

<lb />sign is not more disgusting, than impolitic; for why,
<lb />while so carefully we guard from all approaches of
<lb />death, should we close the only avenues to happiness
<lb />in long life, respect and
<lb />tenderness.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, delighted both by the understanding and
<lb />humanity of her new acquaintance, and pleased at
<lb />being joined by <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, was beginning to be
<lb />perfectly satisfied with her situation, when, creeping
<lb />softly towards her, she again perceived the black
<lb />gentleman.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q553" next="q554">Ah!</q> cried she, with some vexation, <q id="q554" prev="q553">here
<lb />comes my old tormentor?  Screen me from him if pos&shy;
<lb />sible, or he will again make me his prisoner.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q555" next="q556">Fear not,</q> cried the white domino; <q id="q556" prev="q555">he is an
<lb />evil spirit, and we will surely lay him.  If one spell
<lb />fails, we must try another.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then perceiving <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, begged he
<lb />would also assist in barricading her from the fiend
<lb />who so obstinately pursued her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> most gratefully acceeded to the pro&shy;
<lb />posal; and the white domino, who acted as command&shy;
<lb />ing officer, assigned to each his station; he desired
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> would keep quietly to her seat, appointed the
<lb />school-master to be on her guard on the left, took pos&shy;
	  <lb />session himself of the opposite posts, and ordered <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName> to stand centinel in front.</p>
<p><lb />This arrangement being settled, the guards of the
<lb />right and left wings instantly secured their places;
<lb />but while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was considering whether it were
<lb />better to face the beseiged, or the enemy, the arch&shy;
<lb />foe rushed suddenly before him, and laid himself
<lb />down at the feet of <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, extremely disconcerted, began a se&shy;
<pb n="155" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">151</mw>
<lb />rious expostulation upon the ill-breeding of this be&shy;
<lb />haviour; but the devil, resting all excuse upon sup&shy;
<lb />porting his character, only answered by growling.</p>
<p><lb />The white domino seemed to hesitate for a moment
<lb />in what manner to conduct himself, and with a quick&shy;
<lb />ness that marked his chagrin, said to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>You
<lb />told me you knew him&mdash;has he any right to follow
<lb />you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q557" next="q558">If he thinks he has,</q> answered she, a little
<lb />alarmed by his question, <q id="q558" prev="q557">this is no time to dispute
<lb />it.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, to avoid any hazard of altercation, she
<lb />discreetly forbore making further complaints, prefer&shy;
<lb />ring any persecution to seriously remonstrating with
<lb />a man of so much insolence as the Baronet.</p>
<p><lb />The school-master, laughing at the whole transac&shy;
<lb />tion, only said, <q>And pray, madam, after playing
<lb />the devil with all mankind, what right have you to
<lb />complain that one man plays the devil with you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q559" next="q560">We shall, at least, fortify you,</q> said the white
<lb />domino, <q id="q560" prev="q559">from any other assailant; no three-headed
	    <lb /><name>Cerberus</name> could protect you more effectually; but you
<lb />will not, therefore, fancy yourself in the lower re&shy;
<lb />gions; for, if I mistake not, the torment of <emph>three
<lb />guardians</emph> is nothing new to you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q561" next="q562">And how,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, surprised, <q id="q562" prev="q561">should you
<lb />know of my three guardians?  I hope I am not quite
<lb />encompassed with evil spirits!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q563" next="q564">No,</q> answered he; <q id="q564" prev="q563">you will find me as inof&shy;
<lb />fensive as the hue of the domino I wear;&mdash;&mdash;and
<lb />would I could add as insensible!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q565" next="q566">This black gentleman,</q> said the school-master

<lb /><emph>black guard</emph>, has as noble and fiend-like a disposition
<lb />as I remember to have seen; for without even at&shy;
<lb />tempting to take any diversion himself, he seems
<lb />gratified to his heart's content, in excluding from it
<lb />the lady he serves.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q565a" next="q566a">He does me an honour I could well dispense
<lb />with,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q566a" prev="q565a">but I hope he has some secret
<lb />satisfaction in his situation, which pays him for its
<lb />apparent inconvenience.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here the black gentleman half raised himself, and
<lb />attempted to take her hand; she started, and with
<lb />much displeasure drew it back; he then growled, and
<lb />again sunk prostrate.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q567" next="q568">This is a fiend,</q> said the school-master, <q id="q568" prev="q567">who

<lb />never so often say <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">Budge!</q>  Well, fair lady, your for&shy;
<lb />tifications, however, may now be deemed impregnable,
<lb />since I, with a flourish of my rod, can keep off the
<lb />young by recollection of the past, and since the fiend,
<lb />with a jut of his foot, may keep off the old from
<lb />dread of the future!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />Here a <name>Turk</name>, richly habited and resplendent with
<lb />jewels, stalked towards <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and, having regarded
<lb />her some time, called out, <q>I have been looking hard
<lb />about me the whole evening, and, faith, I have seen

<p><lb />The moment he opened his mouth, his voice, to

<lb /><q id="q569" next="q570">Mercy on me,</q> cried she aloud, and pointing to the

<p><lb /><q>Do you not know?</q> cried the white domino.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q571" next="q572">I thought I had known with certainty,</q> answer&shy;

<lb /><q id="q573" next="q574">He is a happy man,</q> said the school-master,

<lb /><q id="q576" prev="q575">have you taken that black dog there for <emph>me?</emph></q></p>
<p><lb />Before this question could be answered, an offen&shy;
<lb />sive smell of soot making every body look around
<lb />the room, the chimney-sweeper already mentioned by
<lb /><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> was perceived to enter it.  Every way
<lb />he moved, a passage was cleared for him, as the
<lb />company, with general disgust, retreated wherever he
<lb />advanced.  He was short, and seemed somewhat in&shy;
<lb />commoded by his dress; he held his soot-bag over
<lb />one arm, and his shovel under the other.  As soon as
<lb />he espied <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose situation was such as to
<lb />prevent her eluding him, he hooted aloud, and
<lb />came stumping up to her.  <q id="q577" next="q578">Ah, ha,</q> he cried, <q id="q578" prev="q577">found
<lb />at last;</q> then, throwing down his shovel, he opened
<lb />the mouth of his bag, and pointing waggishly to her
<lb />head, said, <q>Come, shall I pop you?&mdash;A good place
<lb />for naughty girls; in, I say, poke in!&mdash;&mdash;cram you
<lb />up the chimney.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then he put forth his sooty hands to reach her
<lb />cap.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though she instantly knew the dialect of
	  <lb />her guardian <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, was not therefore the more
<lb />willing to be so handled, and started back to save
<lb />herself from his touch; the white domino also came
<lb />forward, and spread out his arms as a defence to her,
<lb />while the devil, who was still before her, again began
<lb />to growl.</p>

<p><lb /><q>Why then how the devil do you live?  Do you

<p><lb /><q id="q593" next="q594">Shall, shall!  I say!</q> answered the chimney&shy;

<lb />For <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> had saved himself any actual mask, by merely

<p><lb /><q id="q598" next="q599">Beastly snub nose!</q> sputtered out the chimney&shy;

<p><lb /><q id="q600" next="q601">How could this black-guard get in?</q> cried the

<p><lb /><q id="q602" next="q603">All the better</q>, returned the other; <q id="q603" prev="q602">would not

<p>	  <lb /><q>A crown?  Ha! ha!&mdash;a pot o'beer!  Little <persName>Tom</persName>

<p><lb /><q id="q610" next="q611">You would have owed no loss of happiness to an

<lb /><q id="q611" prev="q610">for he was one who dispensed to his friends nothing

<p><lb /><q id="q612" next="q613">Perhaps so,</q> said the domino; <q id="q613" prev="q612">but I fear I

<p><lb /><q id="q614" next="q615">What's here?</q> cried the chimney-sweeper,
<lb />stumbling over the fiend; <q id="q615" prev="q614">what's this black thing?
<lb />Don't like it; looks like the devil.  You shan't stay
<lb />with it; carry you away; take care of you myself.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then offered <persName>Cecilia</persName> his hand; but the black
<lb />gentleman, raising himself upon his knees before her,
<lb />paid her in dumb shew, the humblest devoirs,
<lb />yet prevented her from removing.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q616" next="q617">Ah! ha!</q> cried the chimney-sweeper, signifi&shy;

<lb />warm?</q></p>
<p><lb />The fiend, without returning any answer, con&shy;
<lb />tinued his homage to <persName>Cecilia</persName>; at which the enraged

<lb />chimney-sweeper exclaimed, <q>Come, come with

<p><lb />He then again held out his hand, but <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />pointing to the fiend, answered, <q>How can I come,
<lb />Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q618" next="q619">Shew you the way,</q> cried he; <q id="q619" prev="q618">shovel him off.</q>
<lb />And taking his shovel, he very roughly set about re&shy;
<lb />moving him.</p>
<p><lb />The fiend then began a yell so horrible, that it
<lb />disturbed the whole company; but the chimney&shy;
<lb />sweeper, only saying <q>Aye, aye, blacky, growl away,
<lb />blacky&mdash;makes no odds,&mdash;</q> sturdily continued his
<lb />work; and, as the fiend had no chance of resisting so
<lb />coarse an antagonist without a serious struggle, he
<lb />was presently compelled to change his ground.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q620" next="q621">Warm work!</q> cried the victorious chimney&shy;
<lb />sweeper, taking off his wig, and wiping his head with
<lb />the sleeves of his dress; <q id="q621" prev="q620">pure warm work this!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, once again freed from her persecutor, in&shy;
<lb />stantly quitted her place, almost equally desirous to
<lb />escape the haughty Turk, who was peculiarly her
<lb />aversion, and the facetious chimney-sweeper, whose
<lb />vicinity, either on account of his dress or his conver&shy;
<lb />sation, was by no means desirable.  She was not,
<lb />however, displeased that the white domino and the
<lb />school-master still continued to attend her.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q622" next="q623">Pray look,</q> said the white domino, a they en&shy;
<lb />tered another apartment, <q id="q623" prev="q622">at that figure of Hope;
<lb />is there any in the room half so expressive of
<lb />despondency?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>The reason, however,</q> answered the school&shy;
<lb />master, <q>is obvious; that light and beautiful silver
<pb n="162" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">158</mw>
<lb />anchor upon which she reclines, presents an occa&shy;
<lb />sion irresistible for an attitude of elegant dejection;
<lb />and the assumed character is always given up, where
<lb />an opportunity offers to display any beauty, or
<lb />manifest any perfection in the dear proper person!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q624" next="q625">But why,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="q625" prev="q624">should she assume the
<lb />character of <mcr>Hope?</mcr> Could she not have been
<lb />equally dejected, and equally elegant as Niobe, or
<lb />some tragedy queen?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q626" next="q627">But she does not assume that character,</q> an&shy;
<lb />swered the school-master; <q id="q627" prev="q626">she does not even think
<lb />of it; the dress is her object, and that alone fills up
<lb />all her ideas.  Enquire of almost any body in the room
<lb />concerning the persons they seem to represent,
<lb />and you will find their ignorance more gross than you
<lb />can imagine; they have not once thought upon the
<lb />subject; accident, or convenience, or caprice has
<lb />alone directed their choice.</q></p>
<p><lb />A tall and elegant youth now approached them,
	  <lb />whose laurels and harp announces <persName>Apollo</persName>.  The
<lb />white domino immediately enquired of him if the
<lb />noise and turbulence of the company had any chance
<lb />of being stilled into silence and rapture, by the divine
<lb />music of the inspired god?</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q628" next="q629">No,</q> answered he, pointing to the room in which
<lb />was erected the new gallery, and whence, as he spoke,
<lb />issued the sound of an <foreign lang="fre">hautboy;</foreign>  <q id="q629" prev="q628">there is a flute
<lb />playing there already.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q630" next="q631">O for a <name>Midas</name>,</q> cried the white domino, <q id="q631" prev="q630">to

<lb />ceived from him!</q></p>
<p><lb />They now proceeded to the apartment which had

<lb />so full of company, that they entered it with difficulty.
	  <lb />And here they were again joined by <persName>Minerva</persName>, who,
<lb />taking <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s hand, said, <q>Lord, how glad I am
<lb />you've got away from that frightful black mask!  I
<lb />can't conceive who he is; nobody can find out; it's
<lb />monstrous odd, but he has not spoke a word all night,
<lb />and he makes such a shocking noise when people
<lb />touch him, that I assure you it's enough to put one
<lb />in a fright.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q632" next="q633">And pray,</q> cried the school-master, disguising
<lb />his voice, <q id="q633" prev="q632">how camest thou to take the helmet of
	    <lb /><persName>Minerva</persName> for a fool's cap?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q635" next="q636">Lord, I have not,</q> cried she innocently; <q id="q636" prev="q635">why
	    <lb />the whole dress is <persName>Minerva's</persName>; don't you see?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q638" next="q639">My dear child,</q> answered he, <q id="q639" prev="q638">thou couldest
	    <lb />as well with that little figure pass for a <name>Goliah</name>, as
	    <lb />with that little wit for a <name>Pallas</name>.</q></p>
<p><lb />Their attention was now drawn fron the goddess
	  <lb />of wisdom to a mad <name>Edgar</name>, who so vehemently ran
	  <lb />about the room calling out <q>Poor <persName>Tom's</persName> a cold!</q>
<lb />that, in a short time, he was obliged to take off his
<lb />mask, from an effect, not very delicate, of the heat!</p>
<p><lb />Soon after, a gentleman desiring some lemonade,
<lb />whose toga spoke the consular dignity, though his
	  <lb />broken English betrayed a native of <placeName>France</placeName>, the
<lb />school-master followed him, and, with reverence the
	  <lb />most profound, began to address him in <name>Latin</name>; but,
<lb />turning quick toward him, he gaily said, <q><foreign lang="fre">Mon&shy;
	      <lb />sieur, j'ai l'honneur de representer <persName>Ciceron</persName>, le grand
	      <lb /><persName>Ciceron</persName>, pere de sa patrie! mais quoique j'ai cet
<lb />honneur la, je ne suis pas pedant!&mdash;&mdash;mon dieu,
<lb />Monsieur, je ne parle que le Francois dans la bonne

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">160</mw></p>
<p><lb />Just then <persName>Cecilia</persName>, while looking about the room
<lb />for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, felt herself suddenly pinched by
<lb />the cheek, and hastily turning round, perceived again
<lb />her friend the chimney-sweeper, who, laughing, cried
<lb /><q>Only me! don't be frightened.  Have something to
<lb />tell you;&mdash;had no luck!&mdash;got never a husband yet!
<lb />can't find one! looked all over, too; sharp as a needle,
<lb />Not one to be had! all catched up!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q640" next="q641">I am glad to hear it, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, some&shy;
<lb />what vexed by observing the white domino atten&shy;
<lb />tively listening; <q id="q641" prev="q640">and I hope, therefore, you will
<lb />give yourself no further trouble.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q642" next="q643">Pretty duck!</q> cried he, chiuking her under the
<lb />chin; <q id="q643" prev="q642">never mind, don't be cast down; get one at
<lb />last.  Leave it to me.  Nothing under a plum; won't
<lb />take up with less.  Good by, ducky, good by! must
<lb />go home now--begin to be nodding.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, repeating his kind caresses, he walked
<lb />away.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="q644" next="q645">Do you think, then,</q> said the white domino,
<lb /><q id="q645" prev="q644">more highly of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> for discernment and
<lb />taste then of any body?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q646" next="q647">I hope not!</q> answered she, <q id="q647" prev="q646">for low indeed
<lb />should I then think of the rest of the world!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q648" next="q649">The commision with which he is charged,</q> re&shy;
<lb />turned the domino, <q id="q649" prev="q648">has then misled me; I imagined
<lb />discernment and taste might be necessary ingredients
<lb />for making such a choice as your approbation would
<lb />sanctify; but perhaps his skill in guarding against
<lb />any fraud or deduction in the stipulation he men&shy;
<lb />tioned, may be all that is requisite for the execution
<lb />of his trust.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q650" next="q651">I understand very well,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, a little

	  <lb />hurt, <q id="q651" prev="q650">the severity of your meaning; and if <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName> had any commision but of his own suggestion,
<lb />it would fill me with shame and confusion; but as
<lb />that is not the case, those, at least, are sensations
<lb />which it cannot give me<sic corr=".">,</sic></q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q652" next="q653">My meaning,</q> cried the domino, with some
<lb />earnestness, <q id="q653" prev="q652">should I express it seriously, would
<lb />but prove to you the respect and admiration with
	    <lb />which you have inspired me; and if indeed, as <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName> hinted, such a prize is to be purchased by
<lb />riches, I know not, from what I have seen of its merit,
<lb />any sum I should think adequate to its value.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q654" next="q655">You are determined, I see,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, smiling,
<lb /><q id="q655" prev="q654">to make most liberal amends for your asperity.</q></p>
<p><lb />A loud clack of tongues now interrupted their dis&shy;
<lb />course; and the domino, at the desire of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, for
<lb />whom he had procured a seat, went forward to en&shy;
<lb />quire what was the matter.  But scarce had he given
<lb />up his place a moment, before, to her great mortifi&shy;
<lb />cation, it was occupied by the fiend.</p>
<p><lb />Again but with the same determined silence he
<lb />had hitherto preserved, he made signs of obedience
<lb />and homage, and her perplexity to conjecture who he
<lb />could be, or what were his motives for this persecu&shy;
<lb />tion, became the more urgent as they seemed the less
<lb />likely to be satisfied.  But the fiend, who was no
<lb />other than <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, had every instant less en&shy;
<lb />couragement to make himself known; his plan had
<lb />in nothing succeeded, and his provocation at its
<lb />failure had caused him the bitterest disappointment;
<lb />he had intended, in the character of a tormentor, not
<lb />only to pursue and hover around her himself, but he
<lb />had also hoped, in the same character, to have kept

<lb />at a distance all other admirers; but the violence
<lb />with which he had over-acted his part, by raising her
<lb />disgust and the indignation of the company, rendered
<lb />his views wholly abortive; while the consciousness
<lb />of an extravagance for which, if discovered, he could
<lb />assign no reason not liable to excite suspicions of his
<lb />secret motives, reduced him to guarding a painful
<lb />and most irksome silence the whole evening.  And
	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whose unsuspicious mind the idea of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> had never occurred, added continually to
<lb />the cruelty of his situation, by an undisguised aver&shy;
<lb />sion to his assiduity, as well as by a manifest pre&shy;
<lb />ference to the attendance of the white domino.  All,
<lb />therefore, that his disappointed scheme now left in
<lb />his power, was to watch her motions, listen to her
<lb />discourse, and inflict occasionally upon others some
<lb />part of the chagrin with which he was tormented
<lb />himself.</p>
<p>	  <lb />While they were in this situation, <persName>Harlequin</persName>, in
	  <lb />consequence of being ridiculed by the <name>Turk</name> for want
<lb />of agility, offered to jump over the new desert table,
<lb />and desired to have a little space cleared to give room
<lb />for his motions.  It was in vain the people who dis&shy;
<lb />tributed the refreshments, and who were placed at the
<lb />other side of the table, expostulated upon the danger
<lb />of the experiment; <persName>Morrice</persName> had a rage of enterprize
<lb />untameable, and therefore, first taking a run, he at&shy;
<lb />tempted the leap.</p>
<p><lb />The consequence was such as might naturally be
<lb />expected; he could not accomplish his purpose, but,
<lb />finding himself falling imprudently caught hold of
<lb />the lately erected Awning, and pulled it entirely
<lb />upon his own head, and with it the new contrived
<pb n="167" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">163</mw>
<lb />lights, which in various forms were fixed to it, and
<lb />which all came down together.</p>
<p><lb />The mischief and confusion occasioned by this ex&shy;
<lb />ploit were very alarming, and almost dangerous; those
<lb />who were near the table suffered most by the crush,
<lb />but splinters of the glass flew yet further; and as the
<lb />room, which was small, had been only lighted up by
<lb />lamps hanging from the Awning, it was now in total
<lb />darkness, except close to the door, which was still
<lb />illuminated from the adjoining apartments.</p>
<p><lb />The clamour of Harlequin, who was covered with
<lb />glass, paper machee, lamps, and oil, the screams of
<lb />the ladies, the universal buz of tongues, and the
<lb />struggle between the frighted crowd which was en&shy;
<lb />closed to get out, and the curious crowd from the other
<lb />apartments to get in, occasioned a disturbance and
<lb />tumult equally noisy and confused.  But the most
<lb />serious sufferer was the unfortunate fiend, who
<lb />being nearer the table than <persName>Cecilia</persName>, was so pressed
<lb />upon by the numbers which poured from it, that he
<lb />found a separation unavoidable, and was unable, from
<lb />the darkness and the throng, to discover whether she
<lb />was still in the same place, or had made her escape
<lb />into another.</p>
<p><lb />She had, however, encountered the white domino,
<lb />and, under his protection, was safely conveyed to a
<lb />further part of the room.  Her intention and desire
<lb />were to quit it immediately, but at the remonstrance
<lb />of her conductor, she consented to remain some time
<lb />longer.  <q id="q656" next="q657">The conflict at the door,</q> said he, <q id="q657" prev="q565">will
<lb />quite overpower you.  Stay here but a few minutes,

<lb />time, can you not, by this faint light, suppose me one
<lb />of your guardians, <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, for example, or, if he
<lb />is too old for me, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and entrust yourself to
<lb />my care?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q658" next="q659">You seem wonderfully well acquainted with my
<lb />guardians,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="q659" prev="q658">I cannot imagine how you
<lb />have had your intelligence.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q660" next="q661">Nor can I,</q> answered the domino, <q id="q661" prev="q660">imagine how
<lb /><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> became so particularly your favorite as to
<lb />be entrusted with powers to dispose of you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are mistaken indeed; he is entrusted with
<lb />no powers but such as his own fancy has suggested.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>But how has <persName>Mr. Delville</persName> offended you, that with
<lb />him only you seem to have no commerce or commu&shy;
<lb />nication?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="q662" next="q663"><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>!</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>, still more sur&shy;
	  <lb />prised, <q id="q663" prev="q662">are you also acquainted with <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="q664" next="q665">He is certainly a man of fashion,</q> continued the
<lb />domino, <q id="q665" prev="q664">and he is also a man of honour; surely,
<lb />then, he would be more pleasant for confidence and
<lb />consultation, than one whose only notion of happiness
<lb />is money, whose only idea of excellence is avarice,
<lb />and whose only conception of sense is distrust!</q></p>
<p><lb />Here a violent outcry again interrupted their con&shy;
<lb />versation; but not till <persName>Cecilia</persName> had satisfied her doubts
<lb />concerning the white domino, by conjecturing he was
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, who might easily at the house of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> have gathered the little circumstances of
<lb />her situation to which he alluded, and whose size and
<lb />figure exactly resembled those of her new acquain&shy;
<lb />tance.</p>
<p><lb />The author of the former disturbance was now the
<lb />occasion of the present; the fiend, having vainly
<pb n="169" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">165</mw>
<lb />traversed the room in search of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, stumbled ac&shy;
	  <lb />cidentally upon <persName>Harlequin</persName>, before he was freed from
<lb />the relicks of his own mischief; and unable to resist
<lb />the temptation of opportunity, and the impulse of re&shy;
<lb />venge, he gave vent to the wrath so often excited by
<lb />the blunders, forwardness, and tricks of <persName>Morrice</persName>, and
<lb />inflicted upon him, with his own wooden sword, which
<lb />he seized for that purpose, a chastisement the most
<lb />serious and severe.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Poor <persName>Harlequin</persName>, unable to imagine any reason for
<lb />this violent attack, and already cut with the glass,
<lb />and bruised with the fall, spared not his lungs in
<lb />making known his disapprobation of such treatment:
<lb />but the fiend, regardless either of his complaints or
<lb />his resistance, forbore not to belabour him till com&shy;
<lb />pelled by the entrance of people with lights.  And
<lb />then, after artfully playing sundry anticks under pre&shy;
<lb />tence of still supporting this character, with a motion
<lb />too sudden for prevention, and too rapid for pursuit,
<lb />he escaped out of the room, and hurrying down stairs,
<lb />threw himself into an hackney chair, which conveyed
<lb />him to a place where he privately changed his dress
<lb />before he returned home; bitterly repenting the ex&shy;
<lb />periment he had made, and conscious too late that
<lb />had he appared in a character he might have avowed,
<lb />he could, without impropriety, have attended <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />the whole evening.  But such is deservedly the fre&shy;
<lb />quent fate of cunning, which, while it plots surprise
<lb />and detection of others, commonly overshoots its
<lb />its mark, and ends in its own disgrace.</p>
<p><lb />The introduction of the lights now making manifest
<lb />the confusion which
<lb />the frolic of Harlequin had occa&shy;
<lb />sioned, he was seized with such a dread
<lb />of the resent&shy;
<pb n="170" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">166</mw>
<lb />ment of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, that, forgetting blows, bruises
<lb />and wounds, not one of which were so frightful to
<lb />him as reproof, he made the last exhibition of his
<lb />agility by an abrupt and hasty retreat.</p>
<p><lb />He had, however, no reason for apprehension, since
<lb />in everything that regarded expence, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had
<lb />no feeling, and his lady had no thought.</p>
<p><lb />The rooms now began to empty very fast, but
<lb />among the few masks yet remaining, <persName>Cecilia</persName> again
	  <lb />perceived <persName>Don Quixote</persName>; and while in conjunction
<lb />with the white domino, she was allowing him the
<lb />praise of having supported his character with more
<lb />uniform propriety than any other person in the as&shy;
<lb />sembly, she observed him taking off his mask for the
<lb />convenience of drinking some lemonade, and, look&shy;
	  <lb />ing in his face, found he was no other than <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName>!  Much astonished, and more than ever perplex&shy;
<lb />ed, she again turned to the white domino, who seeing
<lb />in her countenance a surprise of which he knew not
<lb />the reason, said, half laughing, <q>You think, perhaps,
<lb />I shall never be gone?</q>  <q>And indeed I am almost of
<lb />the same opinion; but what can I do?  Instead of
<lb />growing weary but he length of my stay, my reluc&shy;
<lb />tance to shorten it encreases with its duration; and
<lb />all the methods I take, whether by speaking to you
<lb />or looking at you, with a view to be satiated, only
<lb />double my eagerness for looking and listening again!
<lb />I must go, however; and if I am happy, I may per&shy;
<lb />haps meet with you again,&mdash;&mdash;though, if I am wise, I
<lb />shall never seek you more!</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, with the last stragglers that reluc&shy;
<lb />tantly disappeared, he made his exit; leaving <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />greatly pleased with his conversation and his manners,
<pb n="171" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">167</mw>
<lb />but extremely perplexed to account for his know&shy;
<lb />ledge of her affairs and situation.</p>
<p><lb />The school-master had already been gone some
<lb />time.</p>
<p>	  <lb />She was not earnestly pressed by the <name>Harrels</name> and
	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who still remained, to send to a ware&shy;
<lb />house for a dress, and accompany them to the
<lb />Pantheon; but though she was not without some in&shy;
<lb />clination to comply, in the hope of further prolong&shy;
<lb />ing the entertainment of an evening from which she
<lb />had received much pleasure, she disliked the atten&shy;
<lb />dance of the Baronet, and felt averse to grant any
<lb />request that he could make, and therefore she beg&shy;
<lb />ged that they would excuse her; and having waited to
<lb />see their dresses, which were very superb, she retired
<lb />to her own apartment.</p>
<p><lb />A great variety of conjecture upon all that had
<lb />passed, now, and till the moment that she sunk to
<lb />rest, occupied her mind; the extraordinary perse&shy;
<lb />cution of the fiend excited at once her curiosity and
<lb />amazement; while the knowledge of her affairs shewn
<lb />by the white domino, surprised her not less, and in&shy;
<lb />terested her more.</p>

<pb n="172" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">168</mw>
<lb />She begged permission of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to have him
<lb />asked up stairs, and was not a little surprized when
<lb />he proved to be the same old gentleman whose
	  <lb />singular exclamations had so much struck her at <persName>Mr.
	    <lb />Monckton's</persName> and at the rehearsal of <title>Artaserse</title>.</p>
<p><lb />Abruptly and with a stern aspect advancing to her,
<lb /><q>You are rich,</q> he cried; <q>are you therefore
<lb />worthless?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope not!</q> answered she, in some conster&shy;
<lb />nation; while <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, believing his intention
<lb />was to rob them, ran precipitately to the bell, which
<lb />she rang without ceasing till two or three servants
<lb />hastened into the room:  by which time, being less
<lb />alarmed, she only made signs to them to stay, and
<lb />stood quietly herself to wait what would follow.</p>
<p><lb />The old man, without attending to her, continued
<lb />his dialogue with <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Know you then,</q> he said <q>a blameless use of
<lb />riches? such a use as not only in the braod glare of
<lb />day shall shine resplendent, but in the darkness of
<lb />midnight, and stillness of repose, shall give you re&shy;
<lb />flections unimbittered, and slumbers unbroken?  tell
<lb />me, know you this use?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not so well, perhaps,</q> answered she, <q>as I
<lb />ought; but I am very willing to learn better.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Begin, then, while yet youth and inexperience,
<lb />new to the callousness of power and affluence, leave
<lb />something good to work upon; yesterday you saw the
<lb />extravagance of luxury and folly; to-day look
<lb />deeper, and see, and learn to pity, the misery of dis&shy;
<lb />ease and penury.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then put into her hand a paper, which con&shy;
<lb />tained a most affecting account of the misery to
<pb n="173" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">169</mw>
<lb />which a poor and wretched family had been reduced,
<lb />by sickness, and various other misfortunes.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>open as day to melting charity,</q> having
<lb />hastily perused it, took out her purse, and offering to
<lb />him three guineas, said, <q>You must direct me, Sir,
<lb />what to give, if this is insufficient.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Hast thou so much heart?</q> cried he, with emo&shy;
<lb />tion, <q>and has fortune, though it has cursed thee with
<lb />the temptation of prosperity, not yet rooted from thy
<lb />mind its native benevolence?  I return in part thy li&shy;
<lb />beral contribution; this,</q> taking one guinea, <q>dou&shy;
<lb />bles my expectations; I will not, by making thy cha&shy;
<lb />rity distress thee, accelerate the fatal hour of hardness
<lb />and degeneracy.</q></p>
<p><lb />He was then going; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, following him,
<lb />said, <q>No, take it all!  Who should assist the poor
<lb />if I will not?  Rich, without connections; powerful
<lb />without wants; upon whom have they any claim if
<lb />not upon me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>True,</q> cried he, receiving the rest, <q>and wise as
<lb />true.  Give, therefore, whilst yet thou hast the heart
<lb />to give, and make, in thy days of innocence and kind&shy;
<lb />ness, some interest with Heaven and the poor!</q></p>
<p><lb />And then he disappeared.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, my dear,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>what could
<lb />induce you give the man so much money?  Don't
<lb />you see he is crazy?  I dare say he would have been
<lb />just as well contented with sixpence.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I know not what he is,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>but his
<lb />manners are not more singular than his sentiments are
<lb />affecting; and if is actuated by charity to raise
<lb />subscriptions for the indigent, he can surely apply to
<lb />no one who ought so readily to contribute as myself.</q></p>

<p>
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> then came in, and his lady most ea&shy;
<lb />gerly told him the transactions.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Scandalous!</q> he exclaimed; <q>why this is no
<lb />better than being a house-breaker!  Pray give orders
<lb />never to admit him again.  Three guineas!  I never
	    <lb />heard so impudent a thing in my life!  Indeed, <persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>, you must be more discreet in future, you
<lb />will else be ruined before you know where you are.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Thus it is,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, half smiling, <q>that we
<lb />can all ecture one another! to-day you recommend
<lb />&oelig;conomy to me:  yesterday I with difficulty forbore
<lb />recommending it to you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nay,</q> answered he, <q>that was quite another mat&shy;
<lb />ter; expence incurred in the common way of a man's
<lb />living is quite another thing to an extortion of this
<lb />sort.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It is another thing indeed,</q> said she, <q>but I know
<lb />not that it is therefore a better.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> made no answer:  and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, privately
<lb />moralizing upon the different estimates of expence
<lb />and &oelig;conomy made by the dissipated and the chari&shy;
<lb />table, soon retired to her own apartment, determined
<lb />firmly to adhere to her lately adopted plan, and ho&shy;
<lb />ping, by the assistance of her new and very singular
<lb />monitor, to extend her practice of doing good, by en&shy;
<lb />larging her knowledge of distress.</p>
<p><lb />Objects are, however, never wanting for the exer&shy;
<lb />cise of benevolence; report soon published her libe&shy;
<lb />rality, and those who wished to believe it, failed not
<lb />to enquire into its truth.  She was soon at the head
<lb />of a little band of pensioners, and, never satisfied
<lb />with the generosity of her donations, found in a very
<lb />short time, that the common allownace of her guar&shy;
<pb n="175" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">171</mw>
<lb />dians were scarce adequate to the calls of her munifi&shy;
<lb />cence.</p>
<p><lb />And thus, in acts of goodness and charity, passed
<lb />undisturbed another week of the life of <persName>Cecilia</persName>; but
<lb />when the fervour of self-approbation lost its novelty,
<lb />the pleasure with which her new plan was begun first
<lb />subsided into tranquility, and then sank into languor.
<lb />To a heart formed for friendship and affection the
<lb />charms of solitude are very short-lived; and though
<lb />she had sickened of the turbulence of perpetual com&shy;
<lb />pany, she now wearied of passing all her time by her&shy;
<lb />self, and sighed for the comfort of society, and the re&shy;
<lb />lief of communication.  But she saw with astonish&shy;
<lb />ment the difficulty with which this was to be obtained:
<lb />the endless succession of diversions, the continual ro&shy;
<lb />tation of assemblies, the numerousness of splendid en&shy;
<lb />gagements, of which while every one complained,
<lb />every one was proud to boast, so effectually impeded
<lb />private meetings and friendly intercourse, that, which
<lb />ever way she turned herself, all commerce seemed im&shy;
<lb />practicable, but such as either led to dissipation, or
<lb />accidentally flowed from it.</p>
<p><lb />Yet finding the error into which her ardour of re&shy;
<lb />formation had hurried her, and that a rigid seclusion
<lb />from company was productive of a lassitude as little
<lb />favourable to active virtue as dissipation itself, she re&shy;
<lb />solved to soften her plan, and by mingling amusement
<lb />with benevolence, to try, at least, to approach that
<lb />golden mean, which, like the philosopher's stone, al&shy;
<lb />ways eludes our grasp, yet always invites our wishes.</p>
<p><lb />For this purpose she desired to attend <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>
<lb />to the next Opera that should be represented.</p>
<p><lb />The following Saturday, therefore, she accompanied
<pb n="176" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">172</mw>
	  <lb />that lady and <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> to the <placeName>Haymarket</placeName>, escorted
<lb />by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />They were very late; the Opera was begun, and
<lb />even in the lobby the crowd was so great that their
<lb />passage was obstructed.  Here they were presently
<lb />accosted by <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, who, running up to <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />and taking her hand, said, <q>Lord, you can't conceive
<lb />how glad I am to see you! why, my dear creature,
<lb />where have you hid yourself these twenty ages?  You
<lb />are quite in luck in coming to-night, I assure you;
<lb />it's the best Opera we have had this season:  there's
<lb />such a monstrous crowd there's no stirring.  We
<lb />sha'n't get in this half hour.  The coffee-room is quite
<lb />full:  only come and see; is it not delightful?</q></p>
<p><lb />This intimation was sufficient for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />whose love of the Opera was merely a love of com&shy;
<lb />pany, fashion, and shew; and therefore to the coffee&shy;
<lb />house she readily led the way.</p>
<p><lb />And here <persName>Cecilia</persName> found rather the appearance of a
<lb />brilliant assembly of ladies and gentlemen, collected
<lb />merely to see and to entertain one another, than of
<lb />distinct and casual parties, mixing solely from neces&shy;
<lb />sity and waiting only for room to enter a theatre.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The first person that addressed them was <persName>Captain
<lb />Aresby</persName>, who, with his usual delicate languishment,
<lb />smiled upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and softly whispering, <q>How
<lb />divinely you look to-night!</q> proceeded to pay his
<lb />compliments to some other ladies.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Do pray now,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q>observe
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>! only just see where he has fixed him&shy;
<lb />self! in the very best place in the room, and keeping
<lb />the fire from every body!  I do assure you that's al&shy;
<lb />ways his way, and it's monstrous provoking, for if
<pb n="177" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">173</mw>
<lb />one's ever so cold, he lollops so, that one's quite
<lb />starved.  But you must know there's another thing
<lb />he does that is quite as bad, for if he gets a seat, he
<lb />never offers to move, if he sees one sinking with fa&shy;
<lb />tigue.  And besides, if one is waiting for one's car&shy;
<lb />riage two hours together, he makes it a rule never to
<lb />stir a step to see for it.  Only think how monstrous!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>These are heavy complaints, indeed,</q> said Ceci&shy;
<lb />lia, looking at him attentively; <q>I should have ex&shy;
<lb />pected from his appearance a very different account of
<lb />his gallantry, for he seems dressed with more studied
<lb />elegance than anybody here.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O yes,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q>he is the sweetest
<lb />dresser in the world:  he has the most delightful taste
<lb />you can conceive, nobody has half so good a fancy.
<lb />I assure yo it's a great thing to be spoke to by him:
<lb />we are all of us quite angry when he won't take any
<lb />notice of us.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is your anger,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, laughing, <q>in ho&shy;
<lb />nour of himself or of his coat?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, Lord, don't you know all this time that he
<lb />is an <foreign lang="fre">ennuye?</foreign></q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I know, at least,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that he
<lb />would soon make one of me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O but one is never affronted with an <foreign lang="fre">ennuye</foreign>, if he
<lb />is ever so provoking, becuse one always knows what
<lb />it means.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is he agreeable?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, to tell you the truth,&mdash;but pray now don't
<lb />mention it,&mdash;I think
<lb />him most excessive disagreeable!
<lb />He yawns in one's face every time one
<lb />looks at him.  I
<lb />assure you sometimes I expect to see him fall fast
<lb />asleep while I am talking to him, for he is so im&shy;
<pb n="178" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">174</mw>
<lb />mensely absent he don't hear one half that one says;
<lb />only conceive how horrid!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But why, then, do you encourage him? why do
<lb />you take any notice of him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, every body does, I assure you, else I would
<lb />not for the world; but he is so courted you have no
<lb />idea.  However, of all things let me advise you never
<lb />to dance with him; I did once myself, and I declare
<lb />I was quite distressed to death the whole time, for he
<lb />was taken with such a fit of absence he knew nothing
<lb />he was about, sometimes skipping and jumping with
<lb />all the violence in the world, just as if he only danced
<lb />for exercise, and sometimes standing quite still, or
<lb />lolling against the wainscoat and gaping, and taking
<lb />no more notice of me than if he had never seen me in
<lb />his life!</q></p>
<p><lb />The captain now, again advancing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, said,
<lb /><q>So you would not do us the honour to try the mas&shy;
<lb />querade at the Pantheon? however, I hear you had a
<lb />very brilliant spectacle at <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s.  I was quite
<lb /><foreign lang="fre">au desespoir</foreign> that I could not have the honour of
<lb />sliding in; I did <foreign lang="fre">mon possible</foreign>, but it was quite be&shy;
<lb />yond me.</q></p>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now, growing very impatient to hear the
<lb />Opera, begged to know if they might not make a trial
<lb />to get into the pit!</p>
<p><lb /><q>I fear,</q> said the captain, smiling as they passed
<lb />him, without offering any assistance, <q>you will find it
<lb />extreme petrifying; for my part, I confess I am not
<lb />upon the principle of crowding.</q></p>
<p>The ladies, however, accompanied by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb />made the attempt, and soon found, according to the
<lb />custom of report, that the difficulty, for the pleasure
<pb n="179" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">175</mw>
<lb />of talking of it, had been considerably exaggerated.
<lb />They were separated indeed, but their accomodation
<lb />was tolerably good.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was much vexed to find the first act of the
<lb />Opera almost over; but she was soon still more dissa&shy;
<lb />tisfied when she discovered that she had no chance of
<lb />hearing the little which remained:  the place she had
<lb />happened to find vacant was next to a party of young
<lb />ladies, who were so earnestly engaged in their own
<lb />discourse, that they listened not to a note of the Opera,
<lb />and so infinitely diverted with their own witticisms,
<lb />that their tittering and loquacity allowed no one in
<lb />their vicinity to hear better than themselves.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />tried in vain to confine her attention to the singers,
<lb />she was distant from the stage, and to them she was
<lb />near, and her fruitless attempts all ended in chagrin
<lb />and impatience.</p>
<p><lb />At length she resolved to make an effort for enter&shy;
<lb />tainment in another way, and since the expectations
<lb />which brought her to the Opera were destroyed, to
<lb />try, by listening to her fair neighbours, whether those
<lb />who occasioned her disappointment, could make her any amends.</p>
<p><lb />For this purpose she turned to them wholly; yet
<lb />was at first in no little perplexity to understand what
<lb />was going forward, since so universal was the eager&shy;
<lb />ness for talking, and so unsurmountable the antipathy
<lb />to listening, that every one seemed to have her wishes
<lb />bounded by a continual utterance of words, without
<lb />waiting for any answer, or scarce even desiring to be
<lb />heard.</p>
<p><lb />But when, somewhat more used to their dialect and
<lb />manner, she began better to comprehend their dis&shy;
<pb n="180" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">176</mw>
<lb />course, wretchedly indeed did it supply to her the loss
<lb />of the Opera.  She heard nothing but descriptions of
<lb />trimmings, and complaints of hair-dressers, hints of
<lb />conquest that teemed with vanity, and histories of
<lb />engagements which were inflated with exultation.</p>
<p><lb />At the end of the act, by the crowding forward of
<lb />the gentlemen to see the dance, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> had an
<lb />opportunity of making room for her by herself, and
<lb />she had then some reason to expect hearing the rest of
<lb />the Opera in peace, for the company before her, con&shy;
<lb />sisting entirely of young men, seemed, even during
<lb />the dance, fearful of speaking, lest their attention
<lb />should be drawn for a moment from the stage.</p>
<p><lb />But to her infinite surprize, no sooner was the
<lb />second act begun, than their attention ended! they
<lb />turned from the performers to each other, and entered
<lb />into a whispering, but gay conversation, which though
<lb />not loud enough to disturb the audience in general,
<lb />kept in the ears of their neighbours, a buzzing which
<lb />interrupted all pleasure from the representation.  Of
<lb />this effect of their gaiety it seemed uncertain whether
<lb />they were conscious, but very evident that they were careless.</p>
<p><lb />The desperate resource which she had tried during
<lb />the first act, of seeking entertainment from the very
<lb />conversation which prevented her enjoying it, was not
<lb />now even in her power: for these gentlemen, though
<lb />as negligent as the young ladies had been whom they
<lb />disturbed, were much more cautious whom they in&shy;
<lb />structed: their language was ambiguous, and their
<lb />terms, to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, were unintelligible: their subjects,
<lb />indeed, required, some discretion, being nothing less
<lb />than a ludicrous calculation of the age and duration
<pb n="181" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">177</mw>
<lb />of jointured widows, and of the chances and expec&shy;
<lb />tations of unmarried young ladies.</p>
<p><lb />But what more even than their talking provoked
<lb />her, was finding that the moment the act was over,
<lb />when she cared not if their vociferation had been in&shy;
<lb />cessant, one of them called out, <q>Come, be quiet, the
<lb />dance is begun;</q> and then they were again all silent
<lb />attention!</p>
<p>In the third act, however, she was mroe fortunate;
<lb />the gentlemen again changed their places, and they
<lb />were succeeded by others who came to the Opera not
<lb />to hear themselves but the performers:  and as soon
<lb />as she was permitted to listen, the voice of Pacchie&shy;
<lb />rotti took from her all desire to hear any thing but
<lb />itself.</p>
<p>	  <lb />During the last dance she was discovered by <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert Floyer</persName>, who sauntering down fop's alley,
<lb />stationed himself by her side, and whenever the <foreign lang="fre">figu&shy;
<lb />rante</foreign> relieved the principal dancers, turned his eyes
<lb />from the stage to her face, as better worth his notice,
<lb />and equally destined for his amusement.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> too, who for some time had seen and
<lb />watched her, now approached; he had observed with
<lb />much satisfaction that her whole mind had been intent
	  <lb />upon the performance, yet still the familiarity of <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert Floyer's</persName> admiration disturbed and perplexed
<lb />him; he determined, therefore, to make an effort to
<lb />satisfy his doubts by examining into his intentions:
<lb />and, taking him apart, before the dance was quite
<lb />over, <q>Well,</q> he said, <q>who is so handsome here as
<lb />Harrel's ward?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes,</q> answered he, calmly, <q>she is handsome,
<lb />but I don't like her expression.</q></p>

<p>
<lb /><q>No! why what is the fault of it?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Proud, cursed proud.  It is not the sort of
<lb />woman I like.  If one says a civil thing to her, she
<lb />only wishes one at the devil for one's pains.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, you have tried her, then, have you!  why you
<lb />are not, in general, much given to say civil things.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, you know I said something of that sort to
	    <lb />her once about <persName>Juliet</persName>, at the rehearsal.  Were not
<lb />you by?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What, then, was that all?  and did you imagine
<lb />one compliment would do your business with her?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, hang it, who ever dreams of complimenting
<lb />the women now?  that's all at an end.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You won't find she thinks so, though; for, as
<lb />you well say, her pride is unsufferable; and I, who
<lb />have long known her, can assure you it does not di&shy;
<lb />minish upon intimacy.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Perhaps not,&mdash;but there's very pretty picking in
<lb />3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. per annum! one would not think much of a
<lb />little incumbrance upon such an estate.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Are you quite sure the estate is so considerable?
<lb />Report is mightily given to magnify.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, I have pretty good intelligence:  though, after
<lb />all, I don't know but I may be off; she'll take a con&shy;
<lb />founded deal of time and trouble.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Monckton</persName>, too much of a man of interest and of the
<lb />world to cherish that delicacy which covets universal
<lb />admiration for the object of its fondness, then artfully
<lb />enlarged upon the obstacles he already apprehended,
<lb />and insinuated such others as he believed would be
<lb />most likely to intimidate him.  But his subtilty was
<lb />lost upon the impenetrable Baronet, who possessed
<lb />that hard insensibility which obstinately pursues its
<pb n="183" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">179</mw>
<lb />own course, deaf to what is said, and indifferent to
<lb />what is thought.</p>
<p><lb />Meanwhile the ladies were now making way to the
<lb />coffee-room, though very slowly, on account of the
<lb />crowd; and just as they got near the lobby, <persName>Cecilia</persName>
	  <lb />perceived <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, who, immediately making him&shy;
<lb />self, known to her, was offering his service to hand her
<lb />out of the pit, when <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, not seeing or
<lb />not heeding him, pressed forward, and said, <q>Will
<lb />you let me have the honour, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, of taking
<lb />care of you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whom he grew daily more disagreeable,
<lb />coldly declined his assistance, while she readily ac&shy;
	  <lb />cepted that which had first been offered her by <persName>Mr.
<lb />Belfield</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />The haughty Baronet, extremely nettled, forced his
<lb />way on, and rudely stalking up to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, mo&shy;
<lb />tioned his hand for room to pass him, and said, <q>Make
<lb />way, Sir!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Make way for <emph>me</emph>, Sir!</q> cried <persName>Belfield</persName>, opposing
<lb />him with one hand, while with the other he held Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia.</p>
<p><lb /><q>You, Sir? and who are you, Sir?</q> demanded the Baronet,
<lb />disdainfully.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Of that, Sir, I shall give you an account whenever
<lb />you please,</q> answered Belfield, with equal scorn.</p>
<p><lb /><q>What the devil do you mean, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nothing very difficult to be understood,</q> replied
	  <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, and attempted to draw on <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who,
<lb />much alarmed, was shrinking back.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName> then, swelling with rage, reproachfully
<lb />turned to her, and said, <q>Will you suffer such an
<pb n="184" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">180</mw>
<lb />impertinent fellow as that, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, to have
<lb />the honour of taking your hand?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, with great indignation, demanded what
	  <lb />he meant by the term impertinent fellow; and <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName>, yet more insolently repeated it:  <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />extremely shocked, earnestly besought them both to
	  <lb />be quiet; but <persName>Belfield</persName>, at the repetition of this insult,
<lb />hastily let go her hand and put his own upon his sword,
	  <lb />while <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, taking advantage of his situation in
<lb />being a step higher than his antagonist, fiercely pushed
<lb />him back, and descended into the lobby.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, enraged beyond endurance, instantly drew
	  <lb />his sword, and <persName>Sir Robert</persName> was preparing to follow his
<lb />example, when <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in an agony of fright, called
<lb />out, <q>Good Heaven! will nobody interfere?</q>  And
<lb />then a young man, forcing his way through the crowd,
<lb />exclaimed, <q>For shame, for shame, gentlemen! is
<lb />this a place for such violence!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, endeavouring to recover himself, put up
<lb />his sword, and though in a voice half choaked with
<lb />passion, said, <q>I thank you, Sir! I was off my guard.
<lb />I beg pardon of the whole company.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />Then, walking up to <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, he put into his
<lb />hand a card with his name and direction, saying,
<lb /><q>With you, Sir, I shall be happy to settle what apo&shy;
<lb />logies are necessary at your first leisure;</q> and hurried
<lb />away.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, exclaiming aloud that he should soon
<lb />teach him to whom he had been so impertinent, was
<lb />immediately going to follow him, when the affrighted
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> again called out aloud, <q>Oh stop him!&mdash;good
<lb />God!  will nobody stop him!</q></p>
<pb n="185" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">181</mw>
<p>
<lb />The rapidity with which this angry scene had passed
<lb />had filled her with amazement, and the evident re&shy;
<lb />sentment of the Baronet upon her refusing his assis&shy;
<lb />tance, gave her an immediate consciousness that she
<lb />was herself the real cause of the quarrel;  while the
	  <lb />manner in which he was preparing to follow <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName>, convinced her of the desperate scene which was
<lb />likely to succeed; fear, therefore, overcoming every
<lb />other feeling, forced from her this exclamation before
<lb />she knew what she said.</p>
<p><lb />The moment she had spoken, the young man who
<lb />had already interposed again rushed forward, and
	  <lb />seizing <persName>Sir Robert</persName> by the arm, warmly remonstrated
<lb />against the violence of his proceedings, and being pre&shy;
<lb />sently seconded by other gentlemen, almost com&shy;
<lb />pelled him to give up his design.</p>
<p><lb />Then, hastening to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>Be not alarmed, ma&shy;
<lb />dam,</q> he cried, <q>all is over, and every body is safe.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, finding herself thus addressed by a gentle&shy;
<lb />man she had never before seen, felt extremely ashamed
<lb />of having rendered her interest in the debate so appa&shy;
<lb />rent; she courtsied to him in some confusion, and
<lb />taking hold of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s arm, hurried her back
<lb />into the pit, in order to quit a crowd, of which she
<lb />now found herself the principal object.  Curiosity,
<lb />however, was universally excited, and her retreat
<lb />served but to inflame it: some of the ladies, and most
<lb />of the gentlemen, upon various pretences, returned
<lb />into the pit merely to look at her, and in a few mi&shy;
<lb />nutes the report was current that the young lady who
<lb />had been the occasion of the quarrel, was dying with
<lb />love for <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who had kept by her side during
<pb n="186" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">182</mw>
<lb /><sic corr="">the during </sic>the whole affair, felt thunder struck by the
<lb />emotion she had shewn; <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> too, who had
<lb />never quitted her, wished himself exposed to the same
	  <lb />danger as <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, so that he might be honoured
<lb />with the same concern: but they were both too much
<lb />the dupes of their own apprehensions and jealousy,
<lb />to perceive that what they instantly imputed to fond&shy;
<lb />ness, proceeded simply from general humanity, acci&shy;
<lb />dently united with the consciousness of being acces&shy;
<lb />sary to the quarrel.</p>
<p><lb />The young stranger who had officiated as mediator
<lb />between the disputants, in a few moments followed
<lb />her with a glass of water, which he had brought from
<lb />the coffee-room, begging her to drink it and compose
<lb />herself.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though she declined his civility with more
<lb />vexation than gratitude, perceived, as she raised her
<lb />eyes to thank him, that her new friend was a young man
<lb />very strikingly elegant in his appearance.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> next, who, with her party, came back
<lb />into the pit, ran up to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, crying, <q>O my dear
<lb />creature, what a monstrous shocking thing!  You've
<lb />no idea how I am frightened, do you know I hap&shy;
<lb />pened to be quite at the further end of the coffee&shy;
<lb />room when it began, and I could not get out to see
<lb />what was the matter for ten ages; only conceive what
<lb />a situation!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Would your fright, then, have been less,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>had you been nearer the danger?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O Lord no, for when I came within sight I was
<lb />fifty times worse!  I gave such a monstrous scream,
	    <lb />that it quite made <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> start.  I dare say
<lb />he'll tell me of it these hundred years: but really

<lb />when I saw them draw their swords I thought I should
<lb />have died; I was so amazingly surprized you've no
<lb />notion.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here she was interrupted by the re-appearance of
<lb />the active stranger, who again advancing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />said, <q>I am in doubt whether the efforts I make to
<lb />revive will please or irritate you; but though you re&shy;
<lb />jected the last cordial I ventured to present you, per&shy;
<lb />haps you will look with a more favourable eye towards
<lb />that of which I am now the herald.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then, casting her eyes around, saw that he
<lb />was followed by <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.  Full of dis&shy;
<lb />pleasure both at this introduction and at his presence,
<lb />she turned hastily to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and entreated him
<lb />to enquire if the carriage was not ready.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, looking at her with all the exultaiton
<lb />of new-raised vanity, said, with more softness than he
<lb />had ever before addressed her, <q>Have you been
<lb />frightened?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Every body, I believe, was frightened,</q> answered
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, with an air of dignity intended to check his
<lb />rising expectations.</p>
<p><lb /><q>There was no sort of cause,</q> answered he: <q>the
<lb />fellow did not know whom he spoke to, that was all.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Lord, <persName>Sir Robert</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q>how
<lb />could you be so shocking as to draw your sword? you
<lb />can't conceive how horrid it looked.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why I did not draw my sword,</q> cried he, <q>I
<lb />only had my hand on the hilt.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord, did not you, indeed! well, every body said
<lb />you did, and I'm sure I thought I saw five-and-twenty
<lb />swords all at once.  I thought one of you would be
<lb />killed every moment.  It was horrid disagreeable, I
<lb />assure you.</q></p>

	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName> was now called away by some gentle&shy;
<lb />men; and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, earnest to be better in&shy;
<lb />formed of <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s real sentiments, said, with affected
<lb />concern, <q>At present this matter is merely ridicu&shy;
<lb />lous; I am sorry to think in how short a time it may
<lb />become more important<sic corr="."></sic></q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Surely,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName> with quickness, <q>some of
<lb />their friends will interfere! surely upon so trifling a
<lb />subject they will not be so mad, so inexcusable, as to
<lb />proceed to more serious resentment!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Which ever of them,</q> said the stranger, <q>is
<lb />most honoured by this anxiety, will be mad indeed to
<lb />risk a life so valued!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Cannot you, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,</q> continued <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />too much alarmed to regard this insinuation, <q>speak
<lb />with <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?  You are acquainted with him, I
<lb />know: is it impossible you can follow him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I will with pleasure do whatever you wish; but
	    <lb />still if <persName>Sir Robert</persName>&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>O, as to <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, I am very sure,
<lb />will undertake him; I will try to see him to night my&shy;
<lb />self, and entreat him to exert all his influence.</q>
<lb /><q>Ah, madam,</q> cried the stranger archly, and low&shy;
<lb />ering his voice, <q>those <emph>French beads</emph> and <emph>Bristol
<lb />stones</emph> have not, I find, shone in vain!</q></p>
<p><lb />At these words <persName>Cecilia</persName> recognized her white do&shy;
<lb />mino acquaintance at the masquerade: she had before
<lb />recollected his voice, but was too much perturbed to
<lb />consider where or when she had heard it.</p>
<p><lb /><q>If <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>,</q> continued he, <q>does not speedily
<lb />come forth with his plum friend, before the glittering
<lb />of swords and spears is joined to that of jewels, the

<lb />acquaint <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> with the state of the affair.  But
<lb />that lady was too helpless to know in what manner to
<lb />set about it; she could not tell where he was, she
<lb />could not conjecture where he might be.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then rang for his own man, and upon en&shy;
<lb />quiry, heard that he was, in all probability, at
	  <lb /><persName>Brookes's</persName> in <placeName>St. James's-Street</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />She then begged <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> would write to him.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> knew not what to say.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, therefore, equally quick in forming and
<lb />executing her designs, wrote to him herself, and en&shy;
<lb />treated that without losing an instant he would find
<lb />out his friend <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, and endeavour to
	  <lb />effect an accommodation between him and <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName>, with whom he had had a dispute at the Opera
<lb />House.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The man soon returned with an answer that <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> would not fail to obey her commands.</p>
<p><lb />She determined to sit up till he came home, in order
<lb />to learn the event of the negociation.  She considered
<lb />herself as the efficient cause of the quarrel, yet scarce
<lb />knew how or in what to blame herself; the behaviours
	  <lb />of <persName>Sir Robert</persName> had always been offensive to her; she
<lb />disliked his manners, and detested his boldness; and
<lb />she had already shewn her intention to accept the as&shy;
<lb />sistance of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> before he had followed her
<lb />with an offer of his own.  She was uncertain, indeed,
<lb />whether he had remarked what had passed; but she
<lb />had reason to think that, so circumstanced, to have
<lb />changed her purpose, would have been construed into
<lb />an encouragement that might have authorised his
<lb />future presumption of her favour.  All she could find
<lb />to regret, with regard to herself, was wanting the
<lb />presence of mind to have refused the civilities of both.</p>
<pb n="191" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">187</mw>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, though really sorry at the state of hte
<lb />affair, regarded herself as so entirely unconcerned
<lb />in it, that, easily wearied when out of company, she
<lb />soon grew sleepy, and retired to her own room.</p>
<p><lb />the anxious <persName>Cecilia</persName>, hoping every instant the re&shy;
<lb />turn of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, sat up by herself: but it was
<lb />not till near four o'clock in the morning that he made
<lb />his appearance.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, Sir,</q>said she, the moment she saw him,
<lb /><q>I fear by your coming home so late you have had
<lb />much trouble, but I hope it has been successful?</q></p>
<p><lb />Great, however, was her mortification when he an&shy;
<lb />swered that he had not even seen the Baronet, hav&shy;
<lb />ing been engaged himself in so particular a manner,
<lb />that he could not possibly break from his party till
<lb />past three o'clock, at which time he drove to the
	  <lb />house of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, but heard that he was not yet
<lb />come home.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though much disgustd by such a specimen
<lb />of insensibility towards a man whom he pretended to
<lb />call his friend, would not leave him till he had pro&shy;
<lb />mised to arise as soon as it was light, and make an
<lb />effort to recover the time lost.</p>
<p><lb />She was now no longer surprised either at the
<lb />debts of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, or at his <emph>particular occasions</emph>
<lb />for money.  She was convinced he spent half the
<lb />night in gaming, and the consequences, however
<lb />dreadful, were but natural.  That <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>
<lb />also did the same was a matter of much less impor&shy;
<lb />tance to her, but that the life of any man should
<lb />through her means be endangered, disturbed her in&shy;
<lb />expressibly.</p>
<p><lb />She went, however to bed, but arose again at six
<pb n="192" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">188</mw>
<lb />o'clock, and dressed herself by candle light.  In an
<lb />hour's time she sent to enquire if <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was
<lb />stirring, and hearing he was asleep, gave orders to
<lb />have him called.  Yet he did not rise till eight o'clock,
<lb />nor could all her messages or expostulations drive
<lb />him out of the house till nine.</p>
<p><lb />He was scarcely gone before <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> ar&shy;
<lb />rived, who now for the first time had the satisfaction
<lb />of finding her alone.</p>
<p><lb /><q>You are very good for coming so early,</q> cried
<lb />she; <q>have you seen <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?  Have you had
<lb />any conversation with him?</q></p>
<p><lb />Alarmed at her eagerness, and still more at seeing
<lb />by her looks the sleepless night she had passed, he
<lb />made at first no reply; and when, with increasing
<lb />impatience, she repeated her question, he only said,
	  <lb /><q>Has <persName>Belfield</persName> ever visited you since he had the ho&shy;
<lb />nour of meeting you at my house?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, never.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Have you seen him often in public?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, I have never seen him at all but the evening
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> received masks, and last night at the
<lb />Opera.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is it then for the safety of both; the cause of their
<lb />quarrel was so trifling, that I cannot bear to thinks its
<lb />consequence should be serious.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But do you not wish better to one of them than
<lb />to the other?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>As a matter of justice I do, but not from any
<lb />partiality: Sir Robert was undoubtedly the aggressor,
<lb />and <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, though at first too fiery, was cer&shy;
<lb />tainly ill used.</q></p>
<pb n="193" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">189</mw>
<p>
	  <lb />The candour of this speech recovered <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<lb />ton</persName> from his apprehensions; and carefully observing
<lb />her looks while he spoke, he gave her the following
<lb />account.</p>
<p>	  <lb />That he had hastened to <persName>Belfield's</persName> lodgings the
<lb />moment he had left the Opera-house, and, after re&shy;
<lb />peated denials, absolutely forced himself into his
<lb />room, where he was quite alone, and in much agita&shy;
<lb />tion: he conversed with him for more than an hour
<lb />upon the subject of the quarrel, but found he so
	  <lb />warmly resented the personal insult given him by <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName>, that no remonstrance had any effect in mak&shy;
<lb />ing him alter his resolution of demanding satis&shy;
<lb />faction.</p>
<p><lb /><q>And could you bring him to consent to no com&shy;
<lb />promise before you left him?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>.<sic corr="">&rdquo;</sic></p>
<p><lb /><q>No; for before I got to him&mdash;the challenge had
<lb />been sent.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>The challenge! good heaven!&mdash;and do you know
<lb />the event?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I called again this morning at his lodgings, but he
<lb />was not returned home.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And was it impossible to follow him? Were there
<lb />no means to discover whither he was gone?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>None; to elude all pursuit, he went out before
<lb />any body in the house was stirring, and took his ser&shy;
<lb />vant with him.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Have you then been to <persName>Sir Robert</persName>?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>I have been to <placeName>Cavendish-Square</placeName>, but there, it
<lb />seems, he had not appeared all night; I traced him,
<lb />through his servants, from the Opera to a gaming&shy;
<lb />house, where I found he had amused himself till this
<lb />morning.</q></p>
<p><lb />The uneasiness of <persName>Cecilia</persName> now encreased every
<pb n="194" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">190</mw>
<lb />moment; and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, seeing he had no other
<lb />chance of satisfying her, offered his service to go
<lb />again in search of both the gentlemen, and endeavour
<lb />to bring her better information.  She accepted the
<lb />proposal with gratitude, and he departed.</p>
<p><lb />Soon after, she was joined by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who,
<lb />though seized with all the horrors of jealousy at
<lb />sight of her apprehensions, was so desirous to relieve
<lb />them, that without even making any merit of oblig&shy;
<lb />ing her, he almost instantly set out upon the same er&shy;
<lb />rand that employed <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, and determined
<lb />not to mention his design till he found whether it
<lb />would enable him to bring her good tidings.</p>
<p>	  <lb />He was scarce gone when she was told that <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName> begged to have the honour of speaking to
<lb />her.  Surprised at this condescension, she desired he
<lb />might immediately be admitted; but much was her
<lb />surprise augmented, when, instead of seeing her os&shy;
<lb />tentatious guardian, she again beheld her masquerade
<lb />friend, the white domino.</p>
<p><lb />He intreated her pardon for an intrusion neither
<lb />authorized by acquaintance nor by business, though
<lb />somewhat, he hoped, palliated, by his near connec&shy;
<lb />tion with one who was privileged to take an interest
<lb />in her affairs: and then, hastening to the motives
<lb />which had occasioned his visit, <q>when I had the ho&shy;
<lb />nour,</q> he said, <q>of seeing you last night at the
<lb />Opera-house, the dispute which had just happened
<lb />between two gentlemen, seemed to give you an un&shy;
<lb />easiness which could not but be painful to all who ob&shy;
<lb />served it, and as among that number I was not the
<lb />least moved, you will forgive, I hope, my eagerness
<lb />to be the first to bring you intelligence that nothing
<lb />fatal has happened, or is likely to happen.</q></p>

<lb /><q id="CE5">You do me, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE6">much honour;
<lb />and indeed you relieve me from a suspense extremely
<lb />disagreeable.  The accommodation, I suppose, was
<lb />brought about this morning?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="AR3">I find,</q> answered he, smiling <q id="AR4">you now expect
<lb />too much; but hope is never so elastic as when it
<lb />springs from the ruins of terror.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What then is the matter?  Are they, at last, not
<lb />safe?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, perfectly safe; but I cannot tell you they
<lb />have never been in danger.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, if it is now over I am contented: but you
<lb />will very much oblige me, Sir, if you will inform me
<lb />what has passed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You oblige me, madam, by the honour of your
<lb />commands.  I saw but too much reason to apprehend
<lb />that measures the most violent would follow the
<lb />affray of last night; yet as I found that the quarrel
<lb />had been accidental, and the offence unpremeditated,
<lb />I thought it not absolutely impossible that an expe&shy;
<lb />ditious mediation might effect a compromise:  at
<lb />least it was worth trying: for though wrath slowly
<lb />kindled or long nourished is sullen and untractable,
<lb />the sudden anger that has not had time to impress the
<lb />mind with a deep sense of injury, will, when gently
<lb />mangaged, be sometimes appeased with the same
<lb />quickness it is excited: I hoped, therefore, that some
	    <lb />trifling concession from <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, as the aggres&shy;
<lb />sor,&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah Sir!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that, I fear, was not to
<lb />be obtained!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not by me, I must own,</q>he answered; <q>but I
<lb />was not willing to think of the difficulty, and there&shy;
<lb />fore ventured to make the proposal; nor did I leave
<pb n="196" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">192</mw>
<lb />the Opera-house till I had used every possible ar&shy;
	    <lb />gument to persuade <persName>Sir Robert</persName> an apology would
<lb />neither stain his courage nor his reputation.  But his
<lb />spirit brooked not the humiliation.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE9">Spirit!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE10">how mild a word!
<lb />What, then, could poor <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> resolve
<lb />upon?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That, I believe, took him very little time to de&shy;
<lb />cide.  I discovered by means of a gentleman at the
<lb />Opera, who was acquainted with him, where he
<lb />lived, and I waited upon him with an intention to
<lb />offer my services towards settling the affair by arbi&shy;
<lb />tration: for since you call him <emph>poor</emph> <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, I
<lb />think you will permit me, without offence to his an&shy;
<lb />tagonist, to own that his gallantry, though too im&shy;
<lb />petuous for commendation, engaged me in his in&shy;
<lb />terest.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope you don't think,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that an
<lb />offence to his antagonist must necessarily be an of&shy;
<lb />fence to me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Whatever I may have thought,</q> answered he,
<lb />looking at her with evident surprise, <q>I certainly did
<lb />not wish that a sympathy offensive and defensive had
<lb />been concluded between you.  I could not, however,
<lb />gain access to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> last night, but the affair
<lb />dwelt upon my mind, and this morning I called at his
<lb />lodgings as soon as it was light.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>How good you have been!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>your
<lb />kind offices have not, I hope, all proved ineffectual!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>So valourous a <name>Don Quixote</name>,</q> returned he,
<lb />laughing, <q>certainly merited a faithful Esquire! he
<lb />was, however, gone out, and nobody knew whither.
<lb />About half an hour ago I called upon him again; he
<lb />was then just returned home.</q></p>
<pb n="197" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">193</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>Well, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I saw him; the affair was over; and in a short
<lb />time he will be able, if you will allow him so much
<lb />hono<sic corr="">&blank;</sic>ur, to thank you for these enquiries.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>He is then wounded?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>He is a little hurt, but <persName>Sir Robert</persName> is perfectly
	    <lb />safe.  <persName>Belfield</persName> fired first, and missed; the Baronet
<lb />was not successless.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am grieved to hear it, indeed! and where is the
<lb />wound?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>The ball entered his right side, and the moment
<lb />he felt it, he fired his second pistol in the air.  This
<lb />I heard from his servant.  He was brought home
<lb />carefully and slowly; no surgeon had been up on the
<lb />spot, but one was called to him immediately.  I
<lb />stayed to enquire his opinion after the wound had been
<lb />dressed: he told me he had extracted the ball, and
<lb />assured me <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> was not in any danger.  Your
<lb />alarm, madam, last night, which had always been pre&shy;
<lb />sent to me, then encouraged me to take the liberty of
<lb />waiting upon you; for I concluded you could yet
<lb />have had no certain intelligence, and thought it best
<lb />to let the plain and simple fact outrun the probable
<lb />exaggeration of rumour.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for his attention; and Mrs.
<lb />Harrel then making her appearance, he arose and
<lb />said, <q>Had my father known the honour I have had
<lb />this morning of waiting upon <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I am sure
<lb />I should have been charged with his compliments, and
<lb />such a commission would somewhat have lessened the
<lb />presumption of this visit; but I feared lest while I
<lb />should be making interest for my credentials, the pre&shy;
<lb />tence of my embassy might be lost, and other couriers,

<lb />less scrupulous, might obtain previous audiences, and
<lb />anticipate my dispatches.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then took his leave.</p>
<p><lb /><q>This white domino, at last, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
	  <lb /><q>is the son of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>! and thence the know&shy;
<lb />ledge of my situation which gave me so much surprise:
<lb />a son how infinitely unlike his father?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>and as unlike his mother
<lb />too, for I assure you she is more proud and haughty
<lb />even than the old gentleman.  I hate the very sight
<lb />of her, for she keeps every body in such awe that
<lb />there's nothing but restraint in her presence.  But the
<lb />son is a very pretty young man, and much admired
<lb />though I have only seen him in public, for none of the
<lb />family visit here.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who now soon returned, was not a
<lb />little surprised to find that all the intelligence he
<lb />meant to communicate was already known: and not
<lb />the more pleased to hear that the white domino, to
<lb />whom before he owed no goodwill, had thus officially
<lb />preceded him.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who also came just after him, had been
<lb />so little satisfied with the result of his enquiries, that
<lb />from the fear of encreasing the uneasiness of <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />he determined not to make known whither he had
<lb />been; but he soon found his forbearance was of no
<lb />avail, as she was already acquainted with the duel
<lb />and its consequences.  Yet his unremitting desire to
<lb />oblige her urged him twice in the course of the same
<lb />day to again call at <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>'s lodgings, in order
<lb />to bring her thence fresh and unsolicited intelligence.</p>
<p><lb />Before breakfast was quite over, <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, out
<lb />of breath with eagerness, came to tell the news of the
<pb n="199" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">195</mw>
	  <lb />duel, in her way to <emph>church</emph>, as it was now <name>Sunday</name>
	  <lb />morning; and soon after <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName>, who also was
<lb />followed by other ladies, brought the same account,
<lb />which by all was addressed to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with expres&shy;
<lb />sions of concern that convinced her, to her infinite
<lb />vexation, she was generally regarded as the person
<lb />chiefly interested in the accident.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> did not return till late, but then seemed
<lb />in very high spirits: <q> <persName>Miss Beverly</persName>,</q> he cried, <q>I
<lb />bring you news that will repay all your fright; Sir
<lb />Robert is not only safe, but is come off conqueror.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am very sorry, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely
<lb />provoked to be thus congratulated, <q>that any body
<lb />conquered, or any body was vanquished.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>There is no need for sorrow,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb /><q>or for any thing but joy, for he has not killed his
<lb />man; the victory, therefore will neither cost him a
<lb />flight nor a trial.  To-day he means to wait upon you,
<lb />and lay his laurels at your feet.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>He means, then, to take very fruitless trouble,</q>
<lb />said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>for I have not any ambition to be so
<lb />honoured.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> returned he, laughing, <q>this
<lb />won't do now! it might have passed a little while
<lb />ago, but it won't do now, I promise you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though much displeased by this accusation,
<lb />found that disclaiming it only excited further raillery,
<lb />and therefore prevailed upon herself to give him a
<lb />quiet hearing, and scarce any reply.</p>
<p>	  <lb />At dinner, when <persName>Sir Robert</persName> arrived, the dislike she
<lb />had originally taken to him, encreased already into
<lb />disgust by his behaviour the preceding evening, was
<lb />now fixed into the strongest aversion by the horror
<pb n="200" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">196</mw>
<lb />she conceived of his fierceness, and the indignation
<lb />she felt excited by his arrogance.  He seemed, from
<lb />the success of this duel, to think himself raised to the
<lb />highest pinnacle of human glory; triumph sat exult&shy;
<lb />ing on his brow; he looked down on whoever he
<lb />deigned to look at all, and shewed that he thought
<lb />his notice an honour, however imperious the manner
<lb />in which it was accorded.</p>
<p><lb />Upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, he cast, an eye of more
<lb />complacency; he now believed her subdued, and his
<lb />vanity revelled in the belief: her anxiety had so
<lb />thoroughly satisfied him of her love, that she had
<lb />hardly the power left to undeceive him; her silence
<lb />he only attributed to admiration, her coldness to fear,
<lb />and her reserve to shame.</p>
<p><lb />Sickened by insolence so undisguised and unautho&shy;
<lb />rised, and incensed at the triumph of his successful
<lb />brutality, <persName>Cecilia</persName> with pain kept her seat, and with
<lb />vexation reflected upon the necessity she was under of
<lb />passing so large a portion of her time in company to
<lb />which she was so extremely averse.</p>
<p><lb />After dinner, when <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was talking of her
<lb />party for the evening, of which <persName>Cecilia</persName> declined
	  <lb />making one, <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, with a sort of proud humi&shy;
<lb />lity, that half feared rejection, and half proclaimed an
<lb />indifference to meeting it, said, <q>I don't much care
<lb />for going further myself, if <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> will give
<lb />me the honour of taking my tea with her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, regarding him with much surprise, an&shy;
<lb />swered that she had letters to write into the country
<lb />which would confine her to her own room for the rest
<lb />of the evening.  The Baronet, looking at his watch,
<lb />instantly cried, <q>Faith, that is very fortunate, for I
<pb n="201" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">197</mw>
<lb />have just recollected an engagement at the other end
<lb />of the town which had slipped my memory.</q></p>
<p><lb />Soon after they were all gone, <persName>Cecilia</persName> received a
	  <lb />note from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, begging the favour of her
<lb />company the next morning to breakfast.  She readily
<lb />accepted the invitaiton, though she was by no means
<lb />prepared, by the character she had heard of her, to
<lb />expect much pleasure from an acquaintance with that
<lb />lady.</p></div>

	<p><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Cecilia</persName> the next morning, between nine and ten
	  <lb />o'clock, went to <placeName>St. James's square</placeName>; she found nobody
<lb />immediately ready to receive her, but in a short time
	  <lb />was waited upon by <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />After the usual salutations, <q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> he
<lb />said, <q>I have given express orders to my people, that
<lb />I may not be interruped while I have the pleasure
<lb />of passing some minutes in conversation with you,
	    <lb />before you are presented to <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, with an air of solemnity, he led her to a
<lb />seat; and having himself taken possession of another,
<lb />continued his speech.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I have received information, from authority
<lb />which I cannot doubt, that the indiscretion of certain
	    <lb />of your admirers last <name>Saturday</name> at the Opera-house,
<lb />occasioned a disturbance which to a young woman of
<lb />delicacy I should imagine must be very alarming: now
<pb n="202" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">198</mw>
<lb />as I consider myself concerned in your fame and wel&shy;
<lb />fare, from regarding you as my ward, I think it is in&shy;
<lb />cumbent upon me to make enquires into such of your
<lb />affairs as become public; for I should feel in some
<lb />measure disgraced myself, should it appear to the
<lb />world, while you are under my guardianship, that there
<lb />was any want of propriety in the direction of your
<lb />conduct.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, not much flattered by this address, gravely
<lb />answered, that she fancied the affair had been mis&shy;
<lb />represented to him.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I am not much addicted,</q> he replied, <q>to give
<lb />ear to any thing lightly; you must therefore permit
<lb />me to enquire into the merits of the cause, and then
<lb />to draw my own inferences.  And let me, at the same
<lb />time, assure you, there is no other young lady who
<lb />has any right to expect such an attention from me.  I
<lb />must begin by begging you to inform me, upon what
<lb />grounds the two gentlemen in question, for such, by
<lb />courtesy, I presume they are called, thought them&shy;
<lb />selves entitled publicly to dispute your favour?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>My favour, Sir!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much amazed.</p>
<p><lb /><q>My dear,</q> said he, with a complacency meant to
<lb />give her courage, <q>I know the question is difficult
<lb />for a young lady to answer; but be not abashed, I
<lb />should be sorry to distress you, and mean to the
<lb />utmost of my power to save your blushes.  Do not,
<lb />therefore, fear me; consider me as your guardian,
<lb />and assure yourself I am perfectly well disposed to
<lb />consider you as my ward.  Acquaint me, then, freely,
<lb />what are the pretensions of these gentlemen?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To me, Sir, they have, I believe, no pretensions
<lb />at all.</q></p>
<pb n="203" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">199</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>I see you are shy,</q> returned he, with encreasing
<lb />gentleness; <q>I see you cannot be easy with me; and
<lb />when I consider how little you are accustomed to me,
<lb />I do not wonder.  But pray take courage; I think it
<lb />necessary to inform myself of your affairs, and there&shy;
<lb />fore I beg you will speak to me with freedom.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, more and more mortified by this humiliating
<lb />condescension, again assured him he had been misin&shy;
<lb />formed; and was again, though discredited, praised
<lb />for her modesty; when, to her great relief, they were
<lb />interrupted by the entrance of her friend the <emph>white
<lb />domino</emph>.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q><persName>Mortimer</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>I understand you
<lb />have already had the pleasure of seeing this young
<lb />lady?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, Sir,</q> he answered; <q>I have more than once
<lb />had that happiness, but I have never had the honour
<lb />of being introduced to her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, then,</q> said the father, <q>I must
	    <lb />present to you <persName>Mr. Mortimer Delvile</persName>, my son; and
	    <lb /><persName>Mortimer</persName>, in <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> I desire you will remem&shy;
<lb />ber that you respect a ward of your father's.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I will not, Sir,</q> answered he, <q>forget an in&shy;
<lb />junction my own inclinations had already out-run.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mortimer Delvile</persName> was tall and finely formed; his
<lb />features, though not handsome, were full of expres&shy;
<lb />sion; and a noble openness of manners and address
<lb />spoke the elegance of his education, and the liberality
<lb />of his mind.</p>
<p><lb />When this introduction was over, a more general
	  <lb />conversation took place, till <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, suddenly
	  <lb />rising, said to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>You will pardon me, <persName>Miss
<pb n="204" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">200</mw>
<lb />Beverley</persName>, if I leave you for a few minutes; one of my
<lb />tenants sets out to-morrow morning for my estate in
<lb />the North, and he has been two hours waiting to speak
<lb />with me.  But if my son is not particularly engaed,
<lb />I am sure he will be so good as to do the honours of
<lb />the house till his mother is ready to receive you.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, graciously waving his hand, he quitted
<lb />the room.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>My father,</q> cried young <persName>Delvile</persName>, <q>has left me an
<lb />office, which, could I execute it as perfectly as I shall
<lb />willingly, would be performed without a fault.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am very sorry,</q>said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that I have so
<lb />much mistaken your hour of breakfast; but let me not
<lb />be any restraint upon you; I shall find a book, or a
	    <lb />newspaper, or something to fill up the time till <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName> honours me with a summons.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You can only be a restraint upon me,</q>answered
<lb />he, <q>commanding me from your presence.  I
<lb />breakfasted long ago, and am now just come from
<lb /><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>.  I had the pleasure, this morning, of
<lb />being admitted into his room.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And how, Sir, did you find him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not so well, I fear, as he thinks himself; but he
<lb />was in high spirits, and surrounded by his friends,
<lb />whom he was entertaining with all the gaiety of a
<lb />man in full health, and entirely at his ease; though
<lb />I perceived, by the frequent changes of his counte&shy;
<lb />nance, signs of pain and indisposition, that made me,
<lb />however pleased with his conversation, think it neces&shy;
<lb />sary to shorten my own visit, and to hint to those who
<lb />were near me the propriety of leaving him quiet.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Did you see his surgeon, Sir?</q></p>
<pb n="205" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">201</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>No; but he told me he should only have one
<lb />dressing more of his wound, and then get rid of the
<lb />whole business by running into the country.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Were you acquainted with him, Sir, before this
<lb />accident?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, not at all; but the little I have seen of him
	    <lb />has strangely interested me in his favour.  At <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel's</persName> masquerade, where I first met with him, I
<lb />was extremely entertained by his humour&mdash;though
<lb />there, perhaps, as I had also the honour of first seeing
<lb /><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I might be too happy to feel much
<lb />difficulty in being pleased.  And even at the opera he
<lb />had the advantage of finding me in the same favour&shy;
<lb />able disposition, as I had long distinguished you be&shy;
<lb />fore I had taken any notice of him.  I must, however,
<lb />confess I did not think his anger that evening quite
<lb />without provocation&mdash;but I beg your pardon, I may
<lb />perhaps be mistaken, and you, who know the whole
<lb />affair, must undoubtedly be better able to account for
<lb />what happened.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here he fixed his eyes upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with a look of
<lb />curiosity that seemed eager to penetrate into her sen&shy;
<lb />timents of the two antagonists.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No, certainly,</q> she answered; <q>he had all the
<lb />provocation that ill-breeding could give him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And do you, madam,</q> cried he, with much sur&shy;
<lb />prise, <q>judge of this matter with such severity?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, not with severity, simply with can&shy;
<lb />dour.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>With candour?  Alas, then, poor <persName>Sir Robert</persName>!
<lb />Severity were not half so bad a sign for him!</q></p>
<p><lb />A servant now came in, to acquaint <persName>Cecilia</persName> that
	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> waited breakfast for her.</p>
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">9.</mw>

<pb n="206" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">202</mw>
<p>
<lb />This summons was immediately followed by the re&shy;
	  <lb />entrance of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, who, taking her hand, said
<lb />he would himself present her to his lady, and with
<lb />much graciousness assured her of a kind reception.</p>
<p><lb />The ceremonies preceding this interview, added to
<lb />the character she had already heard of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />made <persName>Cecilia</persName> heartily wish it over; but, assuming all
<lb />the courage in her power, she determined to support
<lb />herself with a spirit that should struggle against
<lb />the ostentatious superiority she was prepared to
<lb />expect.</p>
<p><lb />She found her seated upon a sofa, from which, how&shy;
<lb />ever, she arose at her approach; but the moment Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia beheld her, all the unfavourable impressions with
<lb />which she came into her presence immediately vanish&shy;
<lb />ed, and that respect which the formalities of her intro&shy;
<lb />duction had failed to inspire, her air, figure, and
<lb />countenance instantaneously excited.</p>
<p><lb />She was not more than fifty years of age; her
<lb />complexion, though faded, kept the traces of her for&shy;
<lb />mer loveliness; her eyes, though they had lost their
<lb />youthful fire, retained a lustre that evinced their pri&shy;
<lb />meval brilliancy; and the fine symmetry of her fea&shy;
<lb />tures, still uninjured by the siege of time, not only in&shy;
<lb />dicated the perfection of her juvenile beauty, but still
<lb />laid claim to admiration in every beholder.</p>
<p><lb />Her carriage was lofty and commanding; but the
<lb />dignity to which high birth and conscious superiority
<lb />gave rise, was so judiciously regulated by good sense,
<lb />and so happily blended with politeness, that though
<lb />the world at large envied or hated her, the few for
<lb />whom she had herself any regard, she was infallibly
<lb />certain to captivate.</p>
<pb n="207" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">203</mw>
<p>
<lb />The surprise and admiration with which <persName>Cecilia</persName> at
	  <lb />the first glance was struck, proved reciprocal: <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, though prepared for youth and beauty, ex&shy;
<lb />pected not to see a countenance so intelligent, nor
<lb />manners so well formed as those of <persName>Cecilia</persName>: thus mu&shy;
<lb />tually astonished and mutually pleased, their first sa&shy;
<lb />lutations were accompanied by looks so flattering to
<lb />both, that each saw in the other, an immediate pre&shy;
<lb />possession in her favour; and from the moment that
<lb />they met, they seemed instinctively impelled to
<lb />admire.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I have promised <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, madam,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> to his lady, <q>that you would give her a
<lb />kind reception; and I need not remind you that my
<lb />promises are always held sacred.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But I hope you have not also promised,</q> cried
<lb />she, with quickness, <q>that I should give <emph>you</emph> a kind re&shy;
<lb />ception, for I feel at this very moment extremely in&shy;
<lb />clined to quarrel with you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why so, madam?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>For not bringing us together sooner; for now I
<lb />have seen her, I already look back with regret to the
<lb />time I have lost without the pleasure of knowing her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What a claim is this,</q> cried young Delville, <q>upon
<lb />the benevolence of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>! for if she had not
<lb />now the indulgence by frequent and diligent visits to
<lb />make some reparation, she must consider herself as
<lb />responsible for the dissension she will occasion.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>If peace depends upon my visits,</q> answered Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, <q>it may immediately be proclaimed; were it to
<lb />be procured only by my absence, I know not if I should
<lb />so readily agree to the conditions.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I must request of you, madam,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
<pb n="208" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">204</mw>
<lb /><q>that when my son and I retire, you will bestow
<lb />half an hour upon this young lady, in making enqui&shy;
<lb />ries concerning the disturbance last night at the Opera
<lb />House.  I have not, myself, so much time to spare,
<lb />as I have several appointments for this morning; but
<lb />I am sure you will not object to the office, as I know
<lb />you to be equally anxious with myself, that the mino&shy;
<lb />rity of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> should pass without reproach.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not only her minority, but her maturity,</q> cried
	  <lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName>, warmly; <q>and not only her maturity,
<lb />but her decline of life will pass, I hope, not merely
<lb />without reporach, but with fame and applause!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope so too,</q> replied <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>; <q>I wish
<lb />her well through every stage of her life; but for her
<lb />minority alone it is my business to do more than wish.
<lb />For that, I feel my own honour and my own credit
<lb />concerned; my honour, as I gave it to the Dean that
<lb />I would superintend her conduct; and my credit, as
<lb />the world is acquainted with the claim she has to my
<lb />protection.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I will not make any enquiries,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />turning to <persName>Cecilia</persName> with a sweetness that recompensed
<lb />her for the haughtiness of her guardian, <q>till I have
<lb />had some opportunity of convincing <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,
<lb />that my regard for her merits they should be an&shy;
<lb />swered.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You see, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
	  <lb /><q>how little reason you had to be afraid of us; <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName> is as much disposed in your favour as myself,
<lb />and as desirous to be of service to you.  Endeavour,
<lb />therefore, to cast off this timidity, and to make your&shy;
<lb />self easy.  You must come to us often; use will do
<pb n="209" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">205</mw>
<lb />more towards removing your fears, than all the encou&shy;
<lb />ragement we can give you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But what are the fears,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb /><q>that <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> can have to remove? unless, in&shy;
<lb />deed, she apprehends her visits will make us encroach&shy;
<lb />ers, and that the more we are favoured with her pre&shy;
<lb />sence, the less we shall bear her absence.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pray, son,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>what was the
<lb />name of the person who was <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>'s op&shy;
<lb />ponent?  I have forgotten it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Belfield, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>True; it is a name I am perfectly unacquainted
<lb />with:  however, he may possibly be a very good sort
	    <lb />of man; but certainly his opposing himself to <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert Floyer</persName>, a man of some family, a gentleman,
<lb />rich, and allied to some people of distinction, was
<lb />a rather strange circumstance.  I mean not, however,
<lb />to prejudge the case; I will hear it fairly stated; and
<lb />I am the more disposed to be cautious in what I pro&shy;
<lb />nounce, because I am persuaded <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> has
<lb />too much sense to let my advice be thrown away upon
<lb />her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope so, Sir; but with respect to the disturbance
<lb />at the opera, I know not that I have the least occa&shy;
<lb />sion to trouble you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>If your measures,</q> said he, very gravely, <q>are
<lb />already taken, the dean your uncle prevailed upon me
<lb />accept a very useless office; but if any thing is yet un&shy;
<lb />decided, it will not, perhaps, be amiss that I should be
<lb />consulted.  Mean time, I will only recommend to you
<lb />to consider, that <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> is a person whose name
	    <lb />nobody has heard, and that a connection with <persName>Sir Ro&shy;
<pb n="210" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">206</mw>
<lb />bert Floyer</persName> would certainly be very honourable for
<lb />you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed, Sir,</q> said, <persName>Cecilia</persName>,<q>here is some great
<lb />mistake; neither of these gentlemen, I believe, think
<lb />of me at all.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>They have taken, then,</q> cried young <persName>Delvile</persName>
<lb />with a laugh, <q>a very extraordinary method to prove
<lb />their indifference!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>The affairs of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>,</q> continued
<lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>are indeed, I am informed, in some
<lb />disorder; but he has a noble estate, and your fortune
<lb />would soon clear all its incumbrances.  Such an al&shy;
<lb />liance, therefore, would be mutually advantageous:
<lb />but what would result from a union with such a per&shy;
<lb />son as <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?  He is of no family, though in
<lb />that perhaps, you would not be very scrupulous; but
<lb />neither has he any money; what, then, recommends
<lb />him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To me, Sir, nothing!</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>And to me,</q> cried young <persName>Delvile</persName>, <q>almost every
<lb />thing!  He has wit, spirit, and understanding; ta&shy;
<lb />lents to create admiration; and qualities, I believe,
<lb />to engage esteem!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You speak warmly,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>; <q>but if
<lb />such is his character, he merits your earnestness.
<lb />What is it you know of him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not enough, perhaps,</q> answered he, <q>to coolly
<lb />justify my praise; but he is one of those whose first
<lb />appearance takes the mind by surprise, and leaves the
<lb />judgment to make afterwards such terms as it can.
<lb />Will you, madam, when he is recovered, permit me
<lb />to introduce him to you?</q></p>
<pb n="211" />

<p>
<lb /><q>Certainly,</q> said she, smiling; <q>but have a care
<lb />your recommendation does not disgrace your discern&shy;
<lb />ment.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Ths warmth of disposition, <persName>Mortimer</persName>,</q> cried
<lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>produces nothing but difficulties and
<lb />trouble: you neglect the connections I point out, and
<lb />which a little attention might render serviceable as
<lb />well as honourable, and run precipitately into form&shy;
<lb />ing such as can do you no good among people of rank,
<lb />and are not only profitless in themselves, but gene&shy;
<lb />rally lead you into expence and inconvenience.  You
<lb />are now of an age to correct this rashness:  think,
<lb />therefore, better of your own consequence, than thus
<lb />idly to degrade yourself, by forming friendships with
<lb />every shewy adventurer that comes in your way.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>I know not, Sir,</q> answered he, <q>how <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName> deserves to be called an adventurer:  he is not,
<lb />indeed, rich; but he is in a profession where parts
<lb />such as his seldom fail to acquire riches; however, as
<lb />to me his wealth can be of no consequence, why should
<lb />my regard to him wait for it? if he is a young man of
<lb />worth and honour&mdash; &mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Mortimer,</q> interrupted <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, <q>whatever
<lb />he is, we know he is not a man of rank; and whatever
<lb />he may be, we know he cannot become a man of fa&shy;
	    <lb />mily, and consequently for <persName>Mortimer Delvile</persName> he is no
<lb />companion.  If you can render him any service, I
<lb />shall commend your so doing; it becomes your birth,
<lb />it becomes your station in life to assist individuals,
<lb />and promote the general good:  but never in your zeal
<lb />for others forget what is due to yourself, and to the
<lb />ancient and honourable house from which you are
<lb />sprung.</q></p>

<lb /><q>But can we entertain <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> with nothing
<lb />better than family lectures?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>It is for me,</q> said young <persName>Delvile</persName>, rising, <q>to beg
<lb />pardon of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> for having occasioned them:
<lb />but when she is so good as to honour us with her com&shy;
<lb />pany again, I hope I shall have more discretion.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then left the room; and <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> also rising
<lb />to go, said, <q>My dear, I commit you to very kind
<lb />hands:  <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, I am sure, will be happy to hear
<lb />your story; speak to her, therefore, without reserve.
<lb />And pray don't imagine that I make you over to her
<lb />from any slight; on the contrary, I admire and com&shy;
<lb />mend your modesty very much; but my time is ex&shy;
<lb />tremely precious, and I cannot devote so much of it to
<lb />an explanation as your diffidence requires.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, to the great joy of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he retired:
<lb />leaving her much in doubt whether his haughtiness or
<lb />his condescension humbled her most.</p>
<p><lb /><q>These men,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, <q>can never com&shy;
<lb />prehend the pain of a delicate female mind, upon en&shy;
<lb />tering into explanations of this sort:  I understand it,
<lb />however, too well to inflict it.  We will, therefore,
<lb />have no explanations at all till we are better ac&shy;
<lb />quainted; and then, if you will venture to favour me
<lb />with any confidence, my best advice, and, should any
<lb />be in my power, my best services shall be at your
<lb />command.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>You do me, madam, much honour,</q> answered <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>; <q>but I assure you, I have no explanation to
<lb />give.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, well, at present,</q> returned <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb /><q>I am content to hear that answer, as I have acquired
<lb />no right to any other:  but hereafter I shall hope for
<pb n="213" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">209</mw>
<lb />more openness:  it is promised me by your countenance,
<lb />and I mean to claim the promise by my friendship.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Your friendship will both honour and delight me,
<lb />and whatever are your enquiries, I shall always be
<lb />proud to answer them; but, indeed, with regard to this
<lb />affair&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>My dear <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> interrupted <persName>Mrs. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>, with a look of arch incredulity, <q>men seldom
<lb />risk their lives where an escape is without hope of
<lb />recompense.  But we will not now say a word more
<lb />upon the subject.  I hope you will often favour me
<lb />with your company, and by the frequency of your vi&shy;
<lb />sits, make us both forget the shortness of our acquain&shy;
<lb />tance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> finding her resistance only gave birth to
<lb />fresh suspicion, now yielded, satisfied that a very little
<lb />time must unavoidably clear up the truth.  But her
<lb />visit was not therefore shortened, the sudden par&shy;
	  <lb />tiality with which the figure and countenance of <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName> had impressed her, was quickly ripened into
<lb />esteem by the charms of her conversation:  she found
<lb />her sensible, well bred, and high spirited, gifted by
<lb />nature with superior talents, and polished by educa&shy;
<lb />tion and study with all the elegant embellishments of
<lb />cultivation.  She saw in her, indeed, some portion of
<lb />the pride she had been taught to expect; but it was
<lb />so much softened by elegance, and so well tempered
<lb />with kindness, that it elevated her character, without
<lb />rendering her manners offensive.</p>
<p><lb />With such a woman, subjects of discourse could
<lb />never be wanting, nor fertility of powers to make them
<lb />entertaining:  and so much was <persName>Cecilia</persName> delighted with
<lb />her visit, that though her carriage was announced at

<lb />twelve o'clock, she reluctantly concluded it at two;
<lb />and in taking her leave, gladly accepted an invitation
<lb />to dine with her new friend three days after; who,
<lb />equally pleased with her young guest, promised before
<lb />that time to return her visit.</p></div>

<p>
	  <lb /><persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Cecilia</persName> found <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> eagerly waiting to hear
<lb />some account how she had passed the morning, and
	  <lb />fully persuaded that she would leave the <name>Delviles</name>
<lb />with a determination never more, but by necessity, to
<lb />see them:  she was, therefore, not only surprised, but
<lb />disappointed, when instead of fulfilling her expecta&shy;
<lb />tions, she assured her that she had been delighted
<lb />with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, whose engaging qualities amply
<lb />recompensed her for the arrogance of her husband;
<lb />that her visit had no fault but that of being too short;
<lb />and that she had already appointed an early day for
<lb />repeating it.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was evidently hurt by this praise; and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who perceived among all her guardians a
<lb />powerful disposition to hatred and jealousy, soon
<lb />dropt the subject:  though so much had she been
<lb />charmed with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, that a scheme of removal
<pb n="215" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">211</mw>
<lb />once more occured to her, notwithstanding her dislike
<lb />of her stately guardian.</p>
<p>	  <lb />At dinner, as usual, they were joined by <persName>Sir Ro&shy;
<lb />bert Floyer</persName>, who grew more and more assiduous in
<lb />his attendance, but, this day, contrary to his general
<lb />custom of remaining with the gentlemen, made his
<lb />exit before the ladies left the table; and as soon as he
<lb />was gone, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> desired a private conference
<lb />with <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />They went together to the drawing-room, where,
	  <lb />after a flourishing preface upon the merits of <persName>Sir Ro&shy;
<lb />bert Floyer</persName>, he formerly acquainted her that he was
<lb />commissioned by that gentleman, to make her a ten&shy;
<lb />der of his hand and fortune.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had not much reason to be surprised at
<lb />this overture, desired him to tell the baronet, she was
<lb />obliged to him for the honour he intended her, at the
<lb />same time she absolutely declined receiving it.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, laughing, told her this answer was very
<lb />well for a beginning, though it would by no means
<lb />serve beyond the first day of the declaration; but
<lb />when <persName>Cecilia</persName> assured him she should firmly adhere to
<lb />it, he remonstrated with equal surprise and discon&shy;
<lb />tent upon the reasons of her refusal.  She thought it
	  <lb />sufficient to tell him that <persName>Sir Robert</persName> did not please
<lb />her; but, with much raillery, he denied the assertion
<lb />credit, assuring her that he was universally admired
<lb />by the ladies, that she could not possibly receive a
<lb />more honourable offer, and that he was reckoned
<lb />by every body the finest gentleman about the
<lb />town.  His fortune, he added, was equally unexcep&shy;
<lb />tionable with his figure and his rank in life; all the
<pb n="216" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">212</mw>
<lb />world, he was certain, would approve the connection,
<lb />and the settlement made upon her should be dictated
<lb />by herself.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> begged him to be satisfied with an answer
<lb />which she never could change, and to spare her the
<lb />enumeration of particular objections, since Sir Ro&shy;
<lb />bert was wholly and in every respect disagreeable
<lb />to her.</p>
<p><lb /><q>What then,</q> cried he, <q>could make you so
<lb />frightened for him at the opera-house?  There has
<lb />been but one opinion about town ever since of your
<lb />prepossession in his favour.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am extremely concerned to hear it; my fright
<lb />was but the effect of surprise, and belonged not more
	    <lb />to <persName>Sir Robert</persName> than to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb />He told her that nobody else thought the same;
<lb />that her marriage with the baronet was universally re&shy;
<lb />spected; and, in conclusion, notwithstnading her ear&shy;
<lb />nest desire that he would instantly and explicitly in&shy;
	  <lb />form <persName>Sir Robert</persName> of her determination, he repeatedly
<lb />refused to give him any final answer, till she had
<lb />taken more time for consideration.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was extremely displeased at this irksome
<lb />importunity, and still mroe chagrined to find her in&shy;
<lb />cautious emotion at the opera-house, had given rise to
<lb />suspicions of her harbouring a partiality for a man
<lb />whom every day she more heartily disliked.</p>
<p><lb />While she was deliberating in what manner she
<lb />could clear up this mistake, which after she was left
<lb />alone occupied all her thoughts, she was interrupted
<lb />by the entrance of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, whose joy in meet&shy;
<lb />ing her at length by herself exceeded not her own;
<pb n="217" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">213</mw>
<lb />for charmed as he was that he could now examine into
<lb />the state of her affairs, she was not less delighted that
<lb />she could make them known to him.</p>
<p><lb />After mutual expressions, guarded, however, on the
<lb />part of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, though unreserved on that of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, of their satisfaction in being again able to
<lb />converse as in former times, he asked if she would
<lb />permit him, as the privilege of their long acquaintance,
<lb />to speak to her with sincerity.</p>
<p><lb />She assured him he could not more oblige her.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Let me, then,</q> said he, <q>enquire if yet that ar&shy;
<lb />dent confidence in your own steadiness, which so
<lb />much disdained my fears that the change of your resi&shy;
<lb />dence might produce a change in your sentiments, is
	    <lb />still as unshaken as when we parted in <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>?  or
<lb />whether experience, that foe to unpractised refinement,
<lb />has already taught you the fallibility of theory?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>When I assure you,</q> replied <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>
<lb />enquiry gives me no pain, I think I have sufficiently
<lb />answered it; for were I conscious of any alteration,
<lb />it could not but embarrass and distress me.  Very
<lb />far, however, from finding myself in the danger with
<lb />which you threatened me, of <emph>forgetting Bury, its in&shy;
<lb />habitants, and its environs</emph>, I think with pleasure of
	    <lb />little else, since <placeName>London</placeName>, instead of bewitching, has
<lb />greatly disappointed me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>How so?</q> cried <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, much de&shy;
<lb />lighted.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Not,</q> answered she, <q>in itself, not in its magni&shy;
<lb />ficence, nor in its diversions, which seem to be inex&shy;
<lb />haustible; but these, though copious as instruments
<lb />of pleasure, are very shallow as sources of happiness:
<lb />the disappointment, therefore, comes nearer home,
<pb n="218" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">214</mw>
	    <lb />and springs not from <placeName>London</placeName>, but from my own situa&shy;
<lb />tion.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is that then disagreeable to you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You shall yourself judge, when I have told you
<lb />that from the time of my quitting your house till this
<lb />very moment, when I have again the happiness of
<lb />talking with you, I have never once had any conver&shy;
<lb />sation, society, or intercourse, in which friendship or
<lb />affection have had any share, or my mind has had the
<lb />least interest.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then entered into a detail of her way of life,
<lb />told him how little suited to her taste was the un&shy;
	  <lb />bounded dissipation of the <name>Harrels</name>, and feelingly ex&shy;
<lb />patiated upon the disappointment she had received
<lb />from the alteration in the manners and conduct of her
<lb />young friend.  <q>In her,</q> she continued, <q>had I
<lb />found the companion I came prepared to meet, the
<lb />companion from whom I had so lately parted, and in
<lb />whose society I expected to find consolation for the
	    <lb />loss of yours and of <persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>, I should have
<lb />complained of nothing; the very places that now tire,
<lb />might then have entertained me; and all that passes
<lb />for unmeaning dissipation, might have worn the ap&shy;
<lb />pearance of variety and pleasure.  But where the
<lb />mind is wholly without interest, every thing is languid
<lb />and insipid; and accustomed as I have long been to
<lb />think friendship the first of human blessings, and social
<lb />converse the greatest of human enjoyments, however
<lb />can I reconcile myself to a state of careless indiffer&shy;
<lb />ence, to making acquaintance without any concern
<lb />either for preserving or esteeming them, and to going
<lb />on from day to day in an eager search of amusement,
	    <lb />with no companion for the hours of retirement, a<sic corr=""></sic> nd<sic corr="&amp;blank;"></sic>no

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">215</mw>
<lb />view beyond that of passing the present moment in ap&shy;
<lb />parent gaiety and thoughtlessness!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who heard these complaints with
<lb />secret rapture, far from seeking to soften or remove,
<lb />used his utmost endeavours to strengthen and en&shy;
<lb />crease them, by artfully retracting her former way of
<lb />life, and pointing out with added censures the change
<lb />in it she had been lately compelled to make:  <q>a
<lb />change,</q> he continued, <q>which, though ruinous of your
<lb />time, and detrimental to your happiness, use will, I
<lb />fear, familiarize, and familiarity render pleasant.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>These suspicions, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>mortify
<lb />me greatly; and why, when far from finding me
<lb />pleased, you hear nothing but repining, should you
<lb />still continue to harbour them?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Because your trial has yet been too short to
<lb />prove your firmness, and because there is nothing to
<lb />which time cannot contentedly accustom us.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I feel not much fear,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>of stand&shy;
<lb />ing such a test as might fully satisfy you; but never&shy;
<lb />theless, not to be too presumptuous, I have by no
<lb />means exposed myself to all the dangers which you
<lb />think surround me, for of late I have spent almost
<lb />every evening at home and by myself.</q></p>
<p><lb />This intelligence was to <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> a surprise
<lb />the most agreeable he could receive.  Her distaste
<lb />for the amusements which were offered her, greatly
<lb />relieved his fears of her forming any alarming connec&shy;
<lb />tion; and the discovery that while so anxiously he
<lb />had sought her every where in public, she had quietly
<lb />passed her time by her own fire-side, not only re-as&shy;
<lb />sured him for the present, but gave him information
<lb />where he might meet with her in future.</p>

<p>
<lb />He then talked of the duel, and solicitously led her
<lb />to speak openly of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>:  and here, too,
<lb />his satisfaction was entire; he found her dislike of
<lb />him such as his knowledge of her disposition made
<lb />him expect; and she wholly removed his suspicions
<lb />concerning her anxiety about the quarrel, by explain&shy;
<lb />ing to him her apprehensions of having occasioned it
<lb />herself.</p>
<p><lb />Neither did her confidence rest here; she acquainted
	  <lb />him with the conversation she had just had with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, and begged his advice in what manner, she
<lb />might secure herself from further importunity.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had now a new subject for his dis&shy;
<lb />cernment.  Every thing had confirmed to him the pas&shy;
<lb />sion which <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> had conceived for <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and
<lb />he had therefore concluded the interest of the Harrels
<lb />would be all in his favour:  other ideas now struck
	  <lb />him; he found that <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was given up for <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName>; and he determined carefully to watch the
<lb />motions both of the Baronet and her young guardian,
<lb />in order to discover the nature of their plans and con&shy;
<lb />nection.  Mean time, convinced by her unaffected
<lb />aversion to the proposals she had received, that she
<lb />was at present in no danger from the league he sus&shy;
<lb />pected, he merely advised her to persevere in mani&shy;
<lb />festing a calm repugnance to their solicitations, which
<lb />could not fail, before long, to dishearten them both.</p>
<p><lb /><q>But, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I now fear this man as
<lb />much as I dislike him, for his late fierceness and bru&shy;
<lb />tality, though they have encreased my disgust, make
<lb /><sic corr="">make</sic> me dread to shew it.  I am impatient, therefore,
<pb n="221" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">217</mw>
<lb />to have done with him, and to see him no more.  And
	    <lb />for this purpose, I wish to quit the house of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, where he has access at his pleasure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You can wish nothing more judiciously,</q> cried
<lb />he; <q>would you, then, return into the country?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That is not yet in my power; I am obliged to re&shy;
<lb />side with one of my guardians.  To-day I have seen
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, and &mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>?</q> interrupted <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, in a
<lb />voice of astonishment, <q>surely you do not think of
<lb />removing into that family?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What can I do so well?  <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> is a charm&shy;
<lb />ing woman, and her conversation would afford me
<lb />more entertainment and instruction in a single day,
<lb />than under this roof I should obtain in a twelve&shy;
<lb />month.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Are you serious?  Do you really think of making
<lb />such a change?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I really wish it, but I know not yet if it is practi&shy;
	    <lb />cable:  on <name>Thursday</name>, however, I am to dine with her,
<lb />and then, if it is in my power, I will hint to her my
<lb />desire.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>And can <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> possibly wish,</q> cried <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>, with earnestness, <q>to reside in such a
<lb />house?  Is not <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> the most ostentatious,
<lb />haughty, and self-sufficient of men?  Is not his wife
<lb />the proudest of women?  And is not the whole family
<lb />odious to all the world?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You amaze me!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>surely that can&shy;
<lb />not be their general character?  <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, indeed,
<lb />deserves all the censure he can meet for his wearisome
<lb />parade of superiority; but his lady by no means me&shy;
<lb />rits to be included in the same reproach.  I have

<lb />spent this whole morning with her, and though I
<lb />waited upon her with a strong prejudice in her disfa&shy;
<lb />vour, I observed in her no pride that exceeded the
<lb />bounds of propriety and native dignity.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Have you often been at the house?  Do you
<lb />know the son too?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I have seen him three or four times.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And what do you think of him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hardly know enough of him to judge fairly.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But what does he seem to you?  Do you not per&shy;
<lb />ceive in him already all the arrogance, all the con&shy;
<lb />temptuous insolence of his father?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no! far from it indeed; his mind seems to be
<lb />liberal and noble, open to impressions of merit, and
<lb />eager to honour and promote it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are much deceived:  you have been reading
<lb />your own mind, and thought you had read his; I
<lb />would advise you sedulously to avoid the whole fa&shy;
<lb />mily; you will find all intercourse with them irksome
<lb />and comfortless:  such as the father appears at once,
<lb />the wife and the son will, in a few more meetings, ap&shy;
<lb />pear also.  They are descended from the same flock,
<lb />and inherit the same self-complacency.  <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>
<lb />married his cousin, and each of them instigates the
<lb />other to believe that all birth and rank would be at
<lb />an end in the world, if their own superb family had
	    <lb />not a promise of support from their hopeful <persName>Morti&shy;
<lb />mer</persName>.  Should you precipately settle yourself in their
<lb />house, you would very soon be totally weighed down
<lb />by their united insolence.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> again and warmly attempted to defend
<lb />them; but <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> was so positive in his asser&shy;
<lb />tions, and so significant in his insinuations to their

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">219</mw>
<lb />discredit, that she was at length persuaded she had
<lb />judged too hastily, and, after thanking him for his
<lb />counsel, promised not to take any measures towards a
<lb />removal without his advice.</p>
<p><lb />This was all he desired; and now, enlivened by
<lb />finding that his influence with her was unimpaired,
<lb />and that her heart was yet her own, he ceased his ex&shy;
<lb />hortations, and turned the discourse to subjects more
<lb />gay and general, judiciously cautious neither by te&shy;
<lb />dious admonitions to disgust, nor by fretful solicitude
<lb />to alarm her.  He did not quit her till the evening
<lb />was far advanced, and then, in returning to his own
<lb />house, felt all his anxieties and disappointments re&shy;
<lb />compensed by the comfort this long and satisfactory
<lb />conversation had afforded him.  While <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />charmed with having spent the morning with her
<lb />new acquaintance, and the evening with her old
<lb />friend, retired to rest better pleased with the disposal
<lb />of her time than she had yet been since her journey

	  <lb />only attribute to the officious encouragement of <persName>Mr.

<lb />than to avoid an explanation with him.  But she had,
	  <lb />in the mean time, the satisfaction of hearing from <persName>Mr.

<lb />in his enquiries, that <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> was almost entirely

<p><lb />After some general conversation, he asked her how
<lb />lately she had had any news of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?</p>
<p><lb /><q>This morning,</q> she answered, <q>when I had the

<lb />you seen him again, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, madam, twice.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And did you think him almost well?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I thought,</q> answered he, with some hesitation,
<lb /><q>and I think still, that your enquiries ought to be his
<lb />cure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I hope he has far better me&shy;
<lb />dicines:  but I am afraid I have been misinformed,
<lb />for I see you do not think him better.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You must not, however,</q> replied he, <q>blame
<lb />those messengers whose artifice has only had your
<lb />satisfaction in view; nor should I be so malignant as
	    <lb />to blast their designs, if I did not fear that <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;

<lb />tinued deception.</q></p>
<pb n="225" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">221</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>What deception, Sir?  I don't at all understand
<lb />you.  How is his safety endangered?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah, madam!</q> said he smiling, <q>what danger
<lb />indeed is there that any man would not risk to give
<lb />birth to such solicitude!  <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, however, I
<lb />believe, is in none from which a command of yours
<lb />cannot rescue him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Then were I an hard-hearted damsel indeed not
<lb />to issue it! but if my commands are so medicinal,
<lb />pray instruct me how to administer them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You must order him to give up, for the present,
<lb />his plan of going into the country, where he can have
<lb />no assistance, and where his wound must be dressed
<lb />only by a common servant, and to remain quietly in
<lb />town, till his surgeon pronounces that he may travel
<lb />without any hazard.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But is he, seriously, so mad as to intend leaving
<lb />town without the consent of his surgeon?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nothing less than such an intention could have
<lb />induced me to undeceive you with respect to his reco&shy;
<lb />very.  But indeed I am no friend to those artifices
<lb />which purchase present relief by future misery:  I
<lb />venture, therefore, to speak to you the simple truth,
<lb />that by a timely exertion of your influence you may
<lb />prevent further evil.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I know not, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName> with the utmost
<lb />surprise, <q>why you should suppose I have any such
<lb />influence:  nor can I imagine that any deception has
<lb />been practised.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It is possible,</q> answered he, <q>I may have been too
<lb />much alarmed; but in such a case as this, no informa&shy;
<lb />tion ought to be depended upon but that of his surgeon.
<lb />You, ma'am, may probably know his opinion?</q></p>
<pb n="226" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">222</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>Me?&mdash;No, indeed!  I never saw his surgeon:  I
<lb />know not even who he is.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I purpose calling upon him to-morrow morning;
<lb />will <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> permit me afterwards the honour
<lb />of communicating to her what may pass?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I thank you, Sir,</q> said she, colouring very high,
<lb /><q>but my impatience is by no means so great as to oc&shy;
<lb />casion my giving you that trouble.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, perceiving her change of countenance, in&shy;
<lb />stantly, and with much respect, entreated her pardon
<lb />for the proposal; which, however, she had no sooner
<lb />granted, than he said very archly, <q> Why indeed you
<lb />have not much right to be angry, since it was your
<lb />own frankness that excited mine.  And thus, you find,
<lb />like most other culprits, I am ready to cast the blame
<lb />of the offence upon the offended.  I feel, however, an
<lb />irresistible propensity to do service to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>;
<lb />&mdash;shall I sin quite beyond forgiveness if I venture to
<lb />tell you how I found him situated this morning?</q>
<lb /><q>No certainly,&mdash;if you wish it, I can have no ob&shy;
<lb />jection.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I found him, then, surrounded by a set of gay
<lb />young men, who, by way of keeping up his spirits,
<lb />made him laugh and talk without ceasing:  he assured
<lb />me himself that he was perfectly well, and intended
<lb />to gallop out of town to morrow morning; though,
<lb />when I shook hands with him at parting, I was both
<lb />shocked and alarmed to feel, by the burning heat of
<lb />his skin, that, far from discarding his surgeon, he
<lb />ought rather to call in a physician.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am very much concerned to hear this account,</q>
<lb />said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>but I do not well understand what
<lb />you mean should on my part follow it?</q></p>
<pb n="227" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">223</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>That,</q> answered he, bowing, with a look of
<lb />mock gravity, <q>I pretend not to settle!  In stating
<lb />the case I have satisfied my conscience, and if in hear&shy;
<lb />ing it you can pardon the liberty I have taken, I shall
<lb />as much honour the openness of your character, as I
<lb />admire that of your countenance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now, to her no little astonishment, found
<lb />she had the same mistake to clear up at present con&shy;
<lb />cerning <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, that only three days before she
<lb />had explained with respect to the Baronet.  But she
<lb />had no time to speak further upon the subject, as the
<lb />entrance of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> put an end to their discourse.</p>
<p><lb />That lady received her with the most distinguishing
<lb />kindness; apologised for not sooner waiting upon her,
<lb />and repeatedly declared that nothing but indisposi&shy;
<lb />tion should have prevented her returning the favour
<lb />of her first visit.</p>
<p>	  <lb />They were soon after summoned to dinner.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, to the infinite joy of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, was out.</p>
<p><lb />The day was spent greatly to her satisfaction.
<lb />There was no interruption from visitors, she was tor&shy;
<lb />mented by the discussion of no disagreeable subjects,
<lb />the duel was not mentioned, the antagonists were not
<lb />hinted at, she was teazed with no self-sufficient encou&shy;
<lb />ragement and wearied with no mortifying affability;
<lb />the conversation at once was lively and rational, and
<lb />though general, was rendered interesting, by a reci&shy;
<lb />procation of good-will and pleasure in the conversers.</p>
<p><lb />The favourable opinion she had conceived both of
<lb />the mother and the son this long visit served to con&shy;
<lb />firm:  in <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> she found strong sense, quick
	  <lb />parts, and high breeding; in <persName>Mortimer</persName>, sincerity and
<lb />vivacity joined with softness and elegance:  and in
<pb n="228" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">224</mw>
<lb />both there seemed the most liberal admiration of ta&shy;
<lb />lents, with an openness of heart that disdained all
<lb />disguise.  Greatly pleased with their manners, and
<lb />struck with all that was apparent in their characters,
<lb />she much regretted the prejudice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
<lb />which now, with the promise she had given him, was
<lb />all that opposed her making an immediate effort to&shy;
<lb />wards a change in her abode.</p>
<p><lb />She did not take her leave till eleven o'clock, when
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, after repeatedly thanking her for her
<lb />visit, said she would not so much encroach upon her
<lb />good-nature as to request another till she had waited
<lb />upon her in return; but added, that she meant very
<lb />speedily to pay that debt, in order to enable herself,
<lb />by friendly and frequent meetings, to enter upon the
<lb />confidential commission with which her guardian had
<lb />entrusted her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was pleased with the delicacy which gave
<lb />rise to this forbearance, yet having in fact nothing
<lb />either to relate or conceal, she was rather sorry than
<lb />glad at the delay of an explanation, since she found
<lb />the whole family was in an error with respect to the
<lb />situation of her affairs.</p></div>

<lb />in the drawing room:  and, while she was upon the

<lb />my brother?</q></p>
<p><lb />Before she could make an answer, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, in
	  <lb />the same impatient tone, exclaimed, <q>Is it <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q> No it is not,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>did you expect him so
<lb />late?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Expect him?  Yes,</q>
answered <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q> I
<lb />have expected him the whole evening, and cannot
<lb />conceive what he has done with himself.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>'Tis abominably provoking,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb /><q>that he should be out of the way just now when he
<lb />is wanted.  However, I dare say to-morrow will do
<lb />as well.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I don't know that,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>; <q>Reeves
<lb />is such a wretch that I am sure he will give me all the
<lb />trouble in his power.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> entered; and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> called
<lb />out, <q>O brother we have been distressed for you
<lb />cruelly; we have had a man here who has plagued
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> to death, and he wanted you sadly to
<lb />speak to him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I should have been very glad,</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb /><q>to have been of any use, and perhaps it is not yet
<lb />too late; who is the man?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, carelessly, <q>only a fellow
<lb />from that rascally taylor who has been so troublesome
<lb />to me lately.  He has had the impudence, because I
<lb />did not pay him the moment he was pleased to want
<lb />his money, to put the bill into the hands of one Reeves,
<lb />a griping attorney, who has been here this evening,
<lb />and thought proper to talk to me pretty freely.  I can

<lb />tell the gentleman I shall not easily forget his imper&shy;
<lb />tinence! however I really wish mean time I could
<lb />get rid of him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>How much is the bill, Sir?</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Why it's rather a round sum; but I don't know
<lb />how it is, one's bills mount up before one is aware:
<lb />those fellows charge such confounded sums for tape
<lb />and buckram; I hardly know what I have had of him,
<lb />and yet he has run me up a bill of between three and
<lb />four hundred pounds.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />Here there was a general silence; till <persName>Mrs. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName> said, <q>Brother, can't you be so good as to lend
<lb />us the money?  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> says he can pay it again
<lb />very soon.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O yes, very soon,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>for I shall
<lb />receive a great deal of money in a little time; I only
<lb />want to stop this fellow's mouth for the present.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Suppose I go and talk with him?</q> said <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName><sic corr="."></sic></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, he's a brute, a stock!</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>;
<lb /><q>nothing but the money will satisfy him:  he will hear
<lb />no reason; one might as well talk to a stone.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> now looked extremely distressed; but
<lb />upon his sister's warmly pressing him not to lose any
<lb />time, he gently said, <q>If this person will but wait a
<lb />week or two, I should be extremely glad, for really
<lb />just now I cannot take up so much money without
<lb />such particular loss and inconvenience, that I hardly
<lb />know how to do it:&mdash;but yet, if he will not be ap&shy;
<lb />peased, he must certainly have it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Appease?</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>you might as
<lb />well appease the sea in a storm! he is as hard as
<lb />iron.</q></p>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">227</mw>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, then forcing a smile, though evidently
<lb />in much uneasiness, said he would not fail to raise the
<lb />money the next morning, and was taking his leave,
<lb />when <persName>Cecilia</persName>, shocked that such tenderness and good&shy;
<lb />nature should be thus grossly imposed upon, hastily
<lb />begged to speak with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and taking her into
<lb />another room, said, <q>I beseech you, my dear friend,
<lb />let not your worthy brother suffer by his generosity;
	    <lb />permit me in the present exigence to assist <persName>Mr. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName>:  my having such a sum advanced can be of no
<lb />consequence; but I should grieve indeed that your
<lb />brother, who so nobly understands the use of money,
<lb />should take it up at any particular disadvantage.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are vastly kind,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>and I
<lb />will run and speak to them about it:  but which ever
<lb />of you lends the money, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> has assured me
<lb />he shall pay it very soon.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />She then returned with the proposition.  <persName>Mr. Ar&shy;
<lb />nott</persName> strongly opposed it, but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seemed ra&shy;
<lb />ther to prefer it, yet spoke so confidently of his spee&shy;
<lb />dy payment, that he appeared to think it a matter of
<lb />little importance from which he accepted it.  A gene&shy;
<lb />rous contest ensued between <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> and <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />but as she was very earnest, she at length prevailed,
<lb />and settled to go herself the next morning into the
	  <lb />city, in order to have the money advanced by <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName>, who had the management of her fortune en&shy;
<lb />tirely to himself, her other guardians never interfer&shy;
<lb />ing in the executive part of her affairs.</p>
<p><lb />This arranged, they all retired.</p>
<p><lb />And then, with encreasing astonishment, <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />reflected upon the ruinous levity of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and
<lb />the blind security of his wife; she saw in their situa&shy;
<pb n="232" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">228</mw>
<lb />tion danger the most alarming, and in the behaviour
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> selfishness the most inexcusable; such
<lb />glaring injustice to his creditors, such utter insensi&shy;
<lb />bility to his friends, took from her all wish of assisting
<lb />him, though the indignant compassion with which
<lb />she saw the easy generosity of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> so fre&shy;
<lb />quently abused, had now, for his sake merely, induced
<lb />her to relieve him.</p>
<p><lb />She resolved, however, as soon as the present dif&shy;
<lb />ficulty was surmounted, to make another attempt to
<lb />open the eyes of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to the evils which so
<lb />apparently threatened her, and press her to exert all
<lb />her influence with her husband, by means both of ex&shy;
<lb />ample and advice, to retrench his expences, before it
<lb />hsould be absolutely too late to save him from
<lb />ruin.</p>
<p><lb />She determined also, at the same time that she ap&shy;
<lb />plied for the money requisite for this debt, to take up
<lb />enough for discharging her own bill at the booksellers,
	  <lb />and putting in execution her plan of assisting the <name>Hills</name>.</p>
<p><lb />The next morning she arose early, and attended by
<lb />her servant, set out for the house of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, pur&shy;
<lb />posing, as the weather was clear and frosty, to walk
	  <lb />through <placeName>Oxford Road</placeName>, and then put herself into a
<lb />chair; and hoping to return to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s by the
<lb />ususal hour of breakfast.</p>
<p><lb />She had not proceeded far, before she saw a mob
<lb />gathering, and the windows of almost all the houses
<lb />filling with spectators.  She desired her servant to
<lb />enquire what this meant, and was informed that the
<lb />people were assembling to see some malefactors pass
	  <lb />by in their way to <placeName>Tyburn</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />Alarmed at this intelligence from the fear of meet&shy;
<pb n="233" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">229</mw>
<lb />ing the unhappy criminals, she hastily turned down
<lb />the next street, but found that also filling with people,
<lb />who were running to the scene she was trying to
<lb />avoid; encircled thus every way, she applied to a
<lb />maid-servant who was standing at the door of a large
<lb />house, and begged leave to step in till the mob was
<lb />gone by.  The maid immediately consented, and she
<lb />waited here while she sent her man for a chair.</p>
<p><lb />He soon arrived with one; but just as she returned
<lb />to the street-door, a gentleman, who was hastily en&shy;
<lb />tering the house, standing back to let her pass, sud&shy;
<lb />denly exclaimed, <q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>!</q> and looking at
<lb />him, she perceived young <persName>Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I cannot stop an instant,</q> cried she, running
<lb />down the steps, <q>lest the crowd should prevent the
<lb />chair from going on.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Will you not first,</q> said he, handing her in, <q>tell
<lb />me what news you have heard?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>News?</q> repeated she, <q>No, I have heard
<lb />none!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You will only, then, laugh at me for those offi&shy;
<lb />cious offers you did so well to reject?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I know not what offers you mean!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>They were indeed superfluous, and therefore I
<lb />wonder not you have forgotten them.  Shall I tell the
<lb />chairman whither to go?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>.  But I cannot imagine what
<lb />you mean.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>!</q> repeated he, <q>O live for ever

<lb />perhaps be made there, impertinent, officious, and
<lb />useless as mine!</q></p>
<p><lb />He then told her servant the direction, and, mak&shy;

<lb />ing his bow, went into the house she had just
<lb />quitted.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely amazed by this short, but unin&shy;
<lb />telligible conversation, would again have called upon
<lb />him to explain his meaning, but found the crowd en&shy;
<lb />creasing so fast, that she could not venture to detain
<lb />the chair, which with difficulty made its way to the
<lb />adjoining streets:  but her surprise at what had passed
<lb />so entirely occupied her, that when she stopt at the
<lb />house of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, she had almost forgotten what
<lb />had brought her thither.</p>
<p><lb />The foot-boy, who came to the door, told her that
<lb />his master was at home, but not well.</p>
<p><lb />She desired he might be acquainted that she wish&shy;
<lb />ed to speak to him upon business, and would wait
<lb />upon him again at any hour when he thought he

<p><lb />The boy returned with an answer that she might
<lb />call again the next week.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, knowing that so long a delay would destroy
<lb />all the kindness of her intention, determined to write
<lb />to him for the money, and therefore went into the
<lb />parlour, and desired to have pen and ink.</p>
<p><lb />The boy, after making her wait some time in a
<lb />room without any fire, brought her a pen and a little
<lb />ink in a broken tea-cup, saying, <q>Master begs you
<lb />won't spirt it about, for he's got no more; and all
<lb />our blacking's as good as gone.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Blacking!</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, Miss, when master's shoes are blacked, we
<lb />commonly gets a little drap of fresh ink.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> promised to be careful, but desired him to
<lb />fetch her a sheet of paper.</p>
<pb n="235" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">231</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>Law, Miss,</q> cried the boy, with a grin, <q>I dare
<lb />say master'd as soon give you a bit of his nose! hows&shy;
<lb />ever I'll go ax.</q></p>
<p><lb />In a few minutes he returned again, and brought
<lb />in his hand a slate and a pencil; <q>Miss,</q> cried he,
<lb /><q>Master says how you may write upon this, for he
<lb />supposes you have no great matters to say.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, much astonished at this extreme parsimony,
<lb />was obliged to consent but as the point of the pencil
<lb />was very blunt, desired the boy to get a knife, that
<lb />she might cut it.  He obeyed, but said, <q>Pray, Miss,
<lb />take care it ben't known, for master don't do such a
<lb />thing once in a year, and if he know'd I'd got you the
<lb />knife, he'd go nigh to give me a good polt of the head.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then wrote upon the slate her desire to be
<lb />informed in what manner she should send him her re&shy;
<lb />ceipt for six hundred pounds, which she begged to have
<lb />instantly advanced.</p>
<p><lb />The boy came back grinning, and holding up his
<lb />hands, and said, <q>Miss, there's a fine piece of work
<lb />up stairs!  Master's in a peck of troubles; but he
<lb />says how he'll come down, if you'll stay till he's got
<lb />his things on.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Does he keep his bed, then?  I hope I have not
<lb />made him rise?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Miss, he don't keep his bed, only he must get
<lb />ready, for he wears no great matters of clothes when
<lb />he is alone.  You are to know, Miss,</q> lowering his
<lb />voice, <q>that that day as he went abroad with our
<lb />sweep's cloaths on, he comed home in such a pickle
<lb />you never see!  I believe somebody'd knock'd him in
	    <lb />the kennel; so does <persName>Moll</persName>; but don't you say as I teld

	    <lb />you!  He's been special bad ever since.  <persName>Moll</persName> and I
<lb />was as glad as could be, because he's so plaguy sharp;
<lb />for, to let you know, Miss, he's so near, its partly a
<lb />wonder how he lives at all:  and yet he's worth a
<lb />power of money too.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, well,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, not very desirous to
<lb /><sic corr="">to</sic> encourage his forwardness, <q>if I want any thing
<lb />I'll call for you.</q></p>
<p><lb />The boy, however, glad to tell his tale, went on.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Our <persName>Moll</persName> won't stay with him above a week
<lb />longer, Miss, because she says how she can't get no&shy;
<lb />thing to eat, but just some old stinking salt meat,
<lb />that's stayed in the butcher's shop so long, it would
	    <lb />make a horse sick to look at it.  But <persName>Moll's</persName> pretty
<lb />nice; hoswever, Miss, to let you know, we don't get
<lb />a good meal so often as once a quarter! why this last
<lb />week we han't had nothing at all but some dry musty
<lb />red herrings; so you may think, Miss, we're kept
<lb />pretty sharp!</q></p>
<p><lb />He was now interrupted by hearing <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>
<lb />coming down the stairs, upon which, abruptly break&shy;
<lb />ing off his complaints, he held up his finger to his
<lb />nose in token of secrecy, and ran hastily into the
<lb />kitchen.</p>
<p><lb />The appearance of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> was by no means
<lb />rendered more attractive by illness and negligence of
<lb />dress.  He had on a flannel gown and night-cap; his
<lb />black beard, of many days growth, was long and grim,
<lb />and upon his nose and one of his cheeks was a large
<lb />patch of brown paper, which, as he entered the room,
<lb />he held on with both his hands.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> made many apologies for having disturbed
<lb />him, and some civil enquiries concerning his health.</p>

<lb /><q>Ay, ay,</q> cried he pettishly, <q>bad enough; all
<lb />along of that trumpery masquerade; wish I had not
<lb />gone!  Fool for my pains.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>When were you taken ill, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Met with an accident; got a fall, broke my head,
<lb />like to have lost my wig.  Wish the masquerade at
	    <lb />old <persName>Nick</persName>! thought it would have cost nothing, or
<lb />would not have gone.  Warrant shan't get me so
<lb />soon to another!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Did you fall in going home, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ay, ay, plump in the kennel; could hardly get
<lb />out of it; felt myself a going, was afraid to tear my
<lb />clothes, knew the rascal would make me pay for
<lb />them, so by holding up the old sack, came bolt on my
<lb />face! off pops my wig; could not tell what to do; all
<lb />as dark as pitch!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Did not you call for help?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nobody by but scrubs, knew they would not help
<lb />for nothing.  Scrawled out as I could, groped about
<lb />for my wig, found it at last, all soused in the mud;
	    <lb />stuck to my head like <persName>Turner's</persName> cerate.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope, then, you got into an hackney coach?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What for? to make things worse? was not bad

<p><lb /><q>But how did you find yourself when you got home
<lb />Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>How? why wet as muck; my head all bumps,

<lb />a plaister; half ruined in vinegar.  Got a great cold:
<lb />put me in a fever; never been well since.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But have you had no advice, Sir? should not you

<lb />myself, can't I?  Had one once; was taken very bad,
<lb />thought should have popt off; began to flinch, sent
<lb />for the doctor, proved nothing but a cheat! cost me
<lb />a guinea, gave it at fourth visit, and he never came
<lb />agian!&mdash;&mdash;warrant wont have no more?</q></p>
<p><lb />Then perceiving upon the table some dust from the
<lb />pencil, <q>What's here?</q> cried he, angrily, <q>who's
<lb />been cutting the pencil? wish they were hanged;
<lb />suppose its the boy; deserves to be horse-whipped:
<lb />give him a good banging.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> immediately cleared him, by acknowledging
<lb />she had herself been the culprit.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Ay, ay,</q> cried he, <q>thought as much all the
<lb />time! guessed how it was; nothing but ruin and
<lb />waste; sending for money, nobody knows why;
<lb />wanting six hundred pounds&mdash;what to do? throw it
<lb />in the dirt?  Never heard the like!  Shan't have it,
<lb />promise you that,</q> nodding his head, <q>shan't have
<lb />no such thing!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Shan't have it?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much surprised,
<lb /><q>why not, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Keep it for your husband; get you one soon:
<lb />won't have no juggling.  Don't be in a hurry; one in
<lb />my eye.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then began a very earnest expostulation,
<lb />assuring him she really wanted the money, for an oc&shy;
<lb />casion which would not admit of delay.</p>
<p><lb />Her remonstrances, however, he wholly disregard&shy;
<lb />ed, telling her that girls knew nothing of the value of
<lb />money, and ought not to be trusted with it; that he
<lb />would not hear of such extravagance, and was resolv&shy;
<lb />ed not to advance her a penny.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was both provoked and confounded by a re&shy;
<pb n="239" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">235</mw>
<lb />fusal so unexpected; and as she thought herself
<lb />bound in honour to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> not to make known
<lb />the motive of her urgency, she was for some time to&shy;
<lb />tally silenced:  till recollecting her account with the
<lb />bookseller, she determined to rest her plea upon that,
<lb />persuaded that he could not, at least, deny her money
<lb />to pay her own bills.</p>
<p><lb />He heard her, however, with the utmost contempt;
<lb /><q>Books?</q> he cried, <q>what do you want with books?
<lb />do no good; all lost time; words get no cash.</q></p>
<p><lb />She informed him his admonitions were now too
<lb />late, as she had already received them, and must
<lb />therefore necessarily pay for them.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no, cried he, </q>send <lb /><q>'take them back, that's best;
<lb />keep no such rubbish, won't turn to account; do bet&shy;
<lb />ter without 'em.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That, Sir, will be impossible, for I have had them
<lb />some time, and cannot expect the bookseller to take
<lb />them again.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Must, must,</q> cried he, <q>can't help himself; glad
<lb />to have 'em too.  Are but a minor, can't be made pay
<lb />a farthing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> with much indignation heard such fraud re&shy;
<lb />commended, and told him she could by no means con&shy;
<lb />sent to follow his advice.  But she soon found, to her
<lb />utter amazement, that he steadily refused to give her
<lb />any other, or to bestow the slightest attention upon her
<lb />expostulations, sturdily saying that her uncle had left
<lb />her a noble estate, and he would take care to see it
<lb />put in proper hands, by getting her a good and care&shy;
<lb />ful husband.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I have no intention, no wish, Sir,</q> cried she, <q>to
<lb />break into the income or estate left me by my uncle;
<pb n="240" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">236</mw>
<lb />on the contrary, I hold them sacred, and think myself
<lb />bound in conscience never to live beyond them:  but
<lb />the ten thousand poounds bequeathed me by my father,
<lb />I regard as more peculiarly my own property, and
<lb />therefore I think myself at liberty to dispose of it as I
<lb />please.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What,</q> cried he in a rage, <q>make it over to a
<lb />scrubby bookseller! give it up for an old pot-hook? no,
<lb />no, won't suffer it; shan't be, shan't be, I say!  If
	    <lb />you want some books, go to <placeName>Moorfields</placeName>, pick up
<lb />enough at an old stall; get 'em at two-pence a-piece;
<lb />dear enough too<sic corr="."></sic></q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> for some time hoped he was merely indulg&shy;
<lb />ing his strange and sordid humour, by an opposition
<lb />that was only intended to teaze her; but she soon
<lb />found herself extremely mistaken; he was immove&shy;
<lb />able in obstinacy, as he was incorrigible in avarice;
<lb />he neither troubled him self with enquiries nor reason&shy;
<lb />ing, but was contented with refusing her as a child
<lb />might be refused, by peremptorily telling her she did
<lb />not know what she wanted, and therefore should not
<lb />have what she asked.</p>
<p><lb />And with this answer, after all that she could urge,
<lb />she was compelled to leave the house, as he com&shy;
<lb />plained that his brown paper plaister wanted fresh
<lb />dipping in vinegar, and he could stay talking no
<lb />longer.</p>
<p><lb />The disgust with which this behaviour filled her,
<lb />was doubled by the shame and concern of returning to
	  <lb />the <name>Harrels</name> with her promise unperformed; she deli&shy;
<lb />berated upon every method that occurred to her of still
<lb />endeavouring to serve them, but could suggest nothing,
<lb />except trying to prevail upon <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> to interfere

<lb />in her favour.  She liked not, indeed, the office of so&shy;

<p><lb /><q>Again!</q> cried he, handing her out of the chair,
<lb /><q>surely some good genius is at work for me this
<lb />morning.</q></p>
<p><lb />She told him she should not have called so early,
	  <lb />now she was acquainted with the late hours of <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, but that she merely meant to speak with his

<lb />and soon returned with an answer that he would wait

<p><lb />The strange speeches he had made to her when they

<lb />able situation in which he had found her, while she
<lb />was standing up to avoid the sight of the condemned
<lb />malefactors.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed!</q> cried he, in a tone of voice somewhat
<lb />incredulous, <q>and was that the purpose for which you
<lb />stood up?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Certainly, Sir;&mdash;what other could I have?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>None, surely!</q> said he, smiling, <q>but the acci&shy;
<lb />dent was singularly opportune.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Opportune?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, staring, <q>how op&shy;
<lb />portune? this is the second time in the same morn&shy;
<lb />ing that I am not able to understand you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>How <emph>should</emph> you understand what is so little in&shy;
<lb />telligible?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I see you have some meaning which I cannot
<lb />fathom, why, else, should it be so extraordinary that I
<lb />should endeavour to avoid a mob? or how could it be
<lb /><sic corr="">be</sic> opportune that I should happen to meet with
<lb />one?</q></p>
<p><lb />He laughed at first without making any answer;
<lb />but perceiving she looked at him with impatience,
<lb />he, half gaily, half reproachfully, said, <q>Whence is
<lb />it that young ladies, even such whose principles are
<lb />most strict, seem universally, in those affairs where
<lb />their affections are concerned, to think hypocrisy ne&shy;
<lb />cessary, and deceit amiable? and hold it graceful to
<lb />disavow to-day, what they may perhaps mean publicly
<lb />to acknowledge to-morrow?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who heard these questions with unfeigned
<lb />astonishment, looked at him with the utmost eagerness
<lb />for an explanation.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Do you so much wonder,</q> he continued, <q>that I

<pb n="243" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">239</mw>
<lb />some deviation from such rules? and have expected
<lb />more openness and candour in a young lady who has
<lb />given so noble a proof of the liberality of her mind
<lb />and understanding?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You amaze me beyond measure!</q> cried she,
<lb /><q>what rules, what candour, what liberality do you
<lb />mean?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Must I speak yet more plainly? and if I do, will
<lb />you bear to hear me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed I should be extremely glad if you would
<lb />give me leave to understand you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And may I tell you what has charmed me, as well
<lb />as what I have presumed to wonder at?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You may tell me any thing if you will but be less
<lb />mysterious.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Forgive then the frankness you invite, and let me
<lb />acknowledge to you how greatly I honour the noble&shy;
<lb />ness of your conduct.  Surrounded as you are by the
<lb />opulent and the splendid, unshackled by dependence,
<lb />unrestrained by authority, blest by nature with all
<lb />that is attractive, by situation with all that is desira&shy;
<lb />ble,&mdash;to slight the rich, and disregard the powerful,
<lb />for the purer pleasure of raising oppressed merit, and
<lb />giving to desert that wealth in which alone it seemed
<lb />deficient&mdash;how can a spirit so liberal be sufficiently
<lb />admired, or a choice of so much dignity be too highly
<lb />extolled?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I find,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I must forbear any fur&shy;
<lb />ther enquiry, for the more I hear, the less I under&shy;
<lb />stand.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pardon me, then,</q> cried he, <q>if here, I return to
<lb />my first question; whence is it that a young lady,
<lb />who can think so nobly, and act so disinterestedly,
<pb n="244" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">240</mw>
<lb />should not be uniformly great, simple in truth, and
<lb />unaffected in sincerity?  Why should she be thus
<lb />guarded, where frankness would do her so much ho&shy;
<lb />nour?  Why blush in owning what all others may
<lb />blush in envying?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed you perplex me intolerably;</q> cried Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, with some vexation.  <q>Why, Sir, will you not
<lb />be more explicit?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And why, madam,</q> returned he, with a laugh,
<lb /><q>would you tempt me to be more impertinent?
<lb />have I not said strange things already?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Strange indeed,</q> cried she,<q>for not one of them
<lb />can I comprehend!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pardon, then,</q> cried he, <q>and forget them all!
<lb />I scarce know myself what urged me to say them, but
<lb />I began inadvertently, without intending to go on,
<lb />and I have proceeded involuntarily, without knowing
<lb />how to stop.  The fault, however, is ultimately your
<lb />own, for the sight of you creates an insurmountable
<lb />desire to converse with you, and your conversation a
<lb />propensity equally incorrigible to take some interest
<lb />in your welfare.</q></p>
<p><lb />He would then have changed the discourse, and Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, ashamed of pressing him further, was for some
<lb />time silent; but when one of the servants came to in&shy;
<lb />form her that his master meant to wait upon her di&shy;
<lb />rectly, her unwillingness to leave the matter in sus&shy;
<lb />pense, induced her, somewhat abruptly, to say, <q>Per&shy;
<lb />haps, Sir, you are thinking of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="post()">A happy conjecture!</q> cried he, <q>but so wild a
<lb />one, I cannot but marvel how it should occur to
<lb />you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, Sir,</q> said she, <q>I must acknowledge I
<pb n="245" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2H1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">241</mw>
<lb />now understand your meaning; but with respect to
<lb />what has given rise to it, I am as much a stranger as
<lb />ever.</q></p>
<p><lb />The entrance of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> here closed the con&shy;
<lb />versation.</p>
<p><lb />He began with his usual ostentatious apologies, de&shy;
<lb />claring he had so many people to attend, so many
<lb />complaints to hear, and so many grievances to redress,
<lb />that it was impossible for him to wait upon her sooner,
<lb />and not without difficulty that he waited upon her now.</p>
<p><lb />Mean time his son almost immediately retired:  and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, instead of listening to this harangue, was
<lb />only disturbing herself with conjectures upon what
<lb />had just passed.  She saw that young <persName>Delvile</persName> con&shy;
<lb />cluded she was absolutely engaged to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<lb />and though she was better pleased that any suspicion
<lb />should fall there than upon <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, she
<lb />was yet both provoked and concerned to be suspected
<lb />at all.  An attack so earnest from almost any other
<lb />person could hardly have failed being very offensive
<lb />to her, but in the manners of young <persName>Delvile</persName> good
<lb />breeding was so happily blended with frankness, that
<lb />his freedom seemed merely to result from the open&shy;
<lb />ness of his disposition, and even in its very act pleaded
<lb />its own excuse.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Her reverie was at length interrupted by <persName>Mr. Del&shy;
<lb />vile's</persName> desiring to know in what he could serve her.</p>
<p><lb />She told him she had present occasion for 600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. and
<lb />hoped he would not object to her taking up that sum.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Six hundred pounds,</q> said he, after some deli&shy;
<lb />beration, <q>is rather an extraordinary demand for a
<lb />young lady in your situation; your allowance is con&shy;
<lb />siderable, you have yet no house, no equipage, no es&shy;

<lb />tablishment; your expences, I should imagine, can&shy;
<lb />not be very great&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb />He stopt, and seemed weighing her request.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, shocked at appearing extravagant, yet too
<lb />generous to mention <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, had again recourse
<lb />to her bookseller's bill, which she told him she was
<lb />anxious to discharge.</p>
<p><lb /><q>A bookseller's bill?</q> cried he:  <q>and do you want
<lb />600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. for a bookseller's bill?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir,</q> said she, stammering, <q>no&mdash;not all for
<lb />that,&mdash;I have some other&mdash;I have a particular occa&shy;
<lb />sion&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But what bill at all,</q> cried he, with much sur&shy;
<lb />prise, <q>can a young lady have with a bookseller?
	    <lb /><title>The Spectator</title>, <title>Tatler</title>, and <title>Guardian</title>, would make
<lb />library sufficient for any female in the kingdom, nor
<lb />do I think it like a gentlewoman to have more.  Be&shy;
<lb />sides, if you ally yourself in such a manner as I shall
<lb />approve and recommend, you will, in all probability,
<lb />find already collected more books than there can
<lb />ever be any possible occasion for you to look into.  And
<lb />let me counsel you to remember, that a lady, whether
<lb />so called from birth or only from fortune, should never
<lb />degrade herself by being put on a level with writers,
<lb />and such sort of people.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for his advice, but confessed
<lb />that upon the present occasion it came too late, as the
<lb />books were now actually in her possession.</p>
<p><lb /><q>and have you taken,</q> cried he, <q>such a measure
<lb />as this without consulting me?  I thought I had as&shy;
<lb />sured you my opinion was always at your service
<lb />when you were in any dilemma.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>but I knew how
<pb n="247" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2H2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">243</mw>
<lb />much you were occupied, and wished to avoid taking
<lb />up your time.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I cannot blame your modesty,</q> he replied, <q>and
<lb />therefore, as you have contracted the debt, you are,
<lb />in honour, bound to pay it.  <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, however,
<lb />has the entire management of your fortune, my many
<lb />avocations obliging me to decline so laborious a trust;
<lb />apply, therefore, to him, and, as things are situated, I
<lb />will make no opposition to your demand.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I have already, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>spoke to Mr.
<lb />Briggs, but&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>You went to him first, then?</q> interrupted <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, with a look of much displeasure.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I was unwilling, Sir, to trouble you till I found
	    <lb />it unavoidable.</q>  She then acquainted him with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs's</persName> refusal, and entreated he would do her the
<lb />favour to intercede in her behalf, that the money
<lb />might no longer be denied her.</p>
<p><lb />Every word she spoke, his pride seemed rising to
<lb />resent, and when she had done, after regarding her
<lb />some time with apparent indignation, he said, <q><emph>I</emph> inter&shy;
<lb />cede!  <emph>I</emph> become an agent!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, amazed to find him thus violently irritated,
<lb />made a very earnest apology for her request; but,
<lb />without paying her any att<sic corr="">t</sic>ention, he walked up and
	  <lb />down the room, exclaiming, <q>an agent! and to <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName>!&mdash;This is an affront I could never have ex&shy;
<lb />pected! why did I degrade myself by accepting this
<lb />humiliating office!  I ought to have known better!</q>
<lb />Then, turning to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>Child,</q> he added, <q>for
<lb />whom is it you take me, and for what?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> again, though affronted in her turn, began
<lb />some protestations of respect; but haughtily inter&shy;
<pb n="248" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2H2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">244</mw>
<lb />rupting her, he said, <q>If of me, and of my rank in life,
<lb />you judge by <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> or by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, I may be
<lb />subject to proposals such as these every day; suffer
<lb />me, therefore, for your better information, to hint to
<lb />you, that the head of an ancient and honourable
<lb />house, is apt to think himself somewhat superior to
<lb />people just rising from the dust of obscurity.</q></p>
<p><lb />Thunderstruck by this imperious reproof, she could
<lb />attempt no further vindication; but when he observed
<lb />her consternation, he was somewhat appeased, and
<lb />hoping he had now impressed her with a proper sense
<lb />of his dignity, he more gently said, <q>You did not, I
<lb />believe, intend to insult me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Good Heaven, Sir; no!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>no&shy;
<lb />thing was more distant from my thoughts; if my ex&shy;
<lb />pressions have been faulty, it has been wholly from
<lb />ignorance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, well, we will think then no more of it.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then said she would no longer detain him, and
<lb />without daring again to mention her petition, she
<lb />wished him good morning.</p>
<p><lb />He suffered her to go, yet as she left the room, gra&shy;
<lb />ciously said, <q>Think no more of my displeasure, for
<lb />it is over:  I see you were not aware of the extraordi&shy;
<lb />nary thing you proposed.  I am sorry I cannot pos&shy;
<lb />sibly assist you; on any other occasion you may de&shy;
<lb />pend upon my services:  but you know <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>,
<lb />you have seen him yourself&mdash;judge, then, how a man
<lb />of any fashion, is to accommodate himself with such a
<lb />person!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> concurred, and courtseying, took her leave.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah! thought she, in her way home, how happy is
<lb />it for me that I followed the advice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>!

<lb />else I had surely made interest to become an inmate

<lb />I should inevitably have been overwhelmed by this
<lb />pompous insolence.  No family, however amiable,

<p>
	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> <name>Harrels</name> and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> waited the return of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> with the utmost impatience; she told them
<lb />with much concern the failure of her embassy, which
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> heard with visible resentment and discon&shy;
<lb />tent, while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, entreating him not to think
<lb />of it, again made an offer of his services, and declared
<lb />he would disregard all personal inconvenience for the
<lb />pleasure of making him and his sister easy.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was much mortified that she had not the
<lb />power to act the same part, and asked <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />whether he believed his own influence with <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>
<lb />would be more successful.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no,</q> answered he, <q>the old curmudgeion
<lb />would but the rather refuse.  I know his reason, and
<lb />therefore am sure all pleas will be vain.  He has deal&shy;
<lb />ings in the alley, and I dare say games with your
<lb />money as if it were his own.  There is, indeed, one
<lb />way&mdash;but I do not think you would like it&mdash;though I
<pb n="250" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2H3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">246</mw>
<lb />protest I hardly know why not&mdash;however, 'tis as well
<lb />let alone.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> insisted upon hearing what he meant, and,
<lb />after some hesitation, he hinted that there were
<lb />means, by which, with very little inconvenience, she
<lb />might borrow the money.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, with that horror natural to all unpractised
<lb />minds at the first idea of contracting a voluntary
<lb />debt, started at this suggestion, and seemed very ill
<lb />disposed to listen to it.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, perceiving her
<lb />repugnance, turned to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, nad said, <q>Well,
<lb />my good brother, I hardly know how to suffer you to
<lb />sell out at such a loss, but yet, my present necessity
<lb />is so urgent&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Don't mention it,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>; <q>I am
<lb />very sorry I let you know it; be certain however, that
<lb />while I have any thing it is your's and my sister's.</q></p>
<p><lb />The two gentlemen were then retiring together;
<lb />but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, shocked for <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, though unmoved
<lb />by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, stopt them to enquire what was the
<lb />way by which it was meant she could borrow the
<lb />money?</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seemed averse to answer, but she would
	  <lb />not be refused; and then he mentioned a <name>Jew</name>, of
<lb />whose honesty he had made undoubted trial, nad who,
<lb />as she was so near being of age, would accept very
<lb />trifling interest for whatever she should like to take
<lb />up.</p>
<p><lb />The heart of <persName>Cecilia</persName> recoiled at the very mention of
<lb />a <name rend="slant(italic)">Jew</name>, and <emph>taking up money upon interest;</emph> but,
<lb />im&shy;
<lb />pelled strongly by her own generosity to emulate that
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, she agreed, after some hesitation, to
<lb />have recourse to this method.</p>
<pb n="251" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2H4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">247</mw>
<p>
	  <lb /><persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Harrel</persName> then made some faint denials, and <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName> protested he had a thousand times rather sell out
<lb />at any discount, than consent to her taking such a mea&shy;
<lb />sure; but, when her first reluctance was conquered, all
<lb />that he urged served but to shew his worthiness in a
<lb />stronger light, and only encreased her desire of saving
<lb />him from repeated imposition.</p>
<p><lb />Her total ignorance in what manner to transact
<lb />this business, made her next put it wholly into the
<lb />hands of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, whom she begged to take up
<lb />600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. upon such terms as he thought equitable, and to
<lb />which, whatever they might be, she would sign her
<lb />name.</p>
<p><lb />He seemed somewhat surprised at the sum, but with&shy;
<lb />out any question or objection undertook the commis&shy;
<lb />sion; and <persName>Cecilia</persName> would not lessen it, because unwil&shy;
<lb />ling to do more for the security of the luxurious Mr.
<lb />Harrel, than for the distresses of the laborious Hills.</p>
<p><lb />Nothing could be more speedy than the execution
<lb />of this affair, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was diligent and expert, the
<lb />whole was settled that morning, and, giving to the
	  <lb /><name>Jew</name> her bond for the payment of the interest he re&shy;
<lb />quired, she put into the hands of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> 350<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>.
<lb />for which he gave his receipt, and she kept the rest
<lb />for her own purposes.</p>
<p><lb />She intended the morning after this transaction to
<lb />settle her account with the bookseller.  When she
<lb />went into the parlour to breakfast, she was somewhat
<lb />surprised to see <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seated there, in earnest
<lb />discourse with his wife.  Fearful of interrupting a
<lb />tete a tete so uncommon, she would have retired; but
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, calling after her, said, <q>O pray come in!
	    <lb />I am only telling <persName>Priscilla</persName> a piece of my usual ill
<pb n="252" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2H4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">248</mw>
<lb />luck.  You must know I happen to be in immediate
<lb />want of 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. though only for three or four days, and
	    <lb />I sent to order honest old <persName>Aaron</persName> to come hither di&shy;
<lb />rectly with the money; but it so happens that he
<lb />went out of town the moment he had done with us
<lb />yesterday, and will not be back again this week.
	    <lb />Now I don't believe there is another <name>Jew</name> in the
<lb />kingdom who will let me have money upon the same
<lb />terms:  they are such notorious rascals, that I hate
<lb />the very thought of employing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who could not but understand what this
<lb />meant, was too much displeased both by his extrava&shy;
<lb />gance and his indelicacy, to feel at all inclined to
<lb />change the destination of the money she had just re&shy;
<lb />ceived; and therefore coolly agreed that it was un&shy;
<lb />fortunate, but added nothing more.</p>
<p><lb /><q>O, it is provoking indeed,</q> cried he,
 <q>for the ex&shy;
<lb />tra-interest I must pay one of those extortioners is
<lb />absolutely so much money thrown away.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, still without noticing these hints, began her
<lb />breakfast.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> then said he would take his
<lb />tea with them; and, while he was buttering some
<lb />dry toast, exclaimed, as if from sudden recollection,
<lb /><q>O Lord, now I think of it, I believe, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,
<lb />you can lend me this money yourself for a day or two.
<lb />The moment old Aaron comes to town, I will pay
<lb />you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose generosity, however extensive, was
<lb />neither thoughtless nor indiscriminate, found some&shy;
<lb />thing so repulsive in this gross procedure, that instead
<lb />of assenting to his request with her usual alacrity, she
<lb />answered very gravely, that the money she had just
<lb />received was already appropriated to a particular
<pb n="253" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">249</mw>
<lb />purpose, and she knew not how to defer making use
<lb />of it.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was extremely chagrined by this reply,
<lb />which was by no means what he expected; but, toss&shy;
<lb />ing down a dish of tea, he began humming an air,
<lb />and soon recovered his usual unconcern.</p>
<p><lb />In a few minutes, ringing his bell, he desired a
	  <lb />servant to go to <persName>Mr. Zackery</persName>, and inform him that he
<lb />wanted to speak with him immediately.</p>
<p><lb /><q>And now,</q> said he, with a look in which vexation
<lb />seemed struggling with carelessness, <q>the thing is
<lb />done!  I don't like, indeed, to get into such hands,
<lb />for 'tis hard ever to get out of them, when once one
<lb />begins,&mdash;and hitherto I have kept pretty clear.  But
<lb />there is no help for it&mdash;<persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> cannot just now
<lb />assist me&mdash;and so the thing must take its course.
	    <lb /><persName>Priscilla</persName>, why do you look so grave?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am thinking how unlucky it is my brother
<lb />should happen to be unable to lend you this money.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, don't think about it; I shall get rid of the
<lb />man very soon, I dare say; I shall pay off in a very
<lb />few days,&mdash;I hope so, at least&mdash;I am sure I mean it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now grew a little disturbed; she looked at
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who seemed also uneasy, and then, with
<lb />some hesitation, said, <q>Have you really never, Sir,
<lb />employed this man before?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>Never in my life:  never any but old <persName>Aaron</persName>.  I
<lb />dread the whole race; I have a sort of superstitious
<lb />notion that if once I get into their clutches, I shall
<lb />never be my own man again; and that induced me to
<lb />beg your assistance.  However, 'tis no great matter.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then began to waver; she feared there might
<lb />be future mischief as well as present inconvenience,
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">11.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">2I</mw>
<pb n="254" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">250</mw>
<lb />in his applying to new usurers, and knowing she had
<lb />now the power to prevent him, thought herself half
<lb />cruel in refusing to exert it.  She wished to consult
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, but found it necessary to take her
<lb />measures immediately, as the Jew was already sent
<lb />for, and must in a few moments be either employed or
<lb />discarded.</p>
<p><lb />Much perplext how to act, between a desire of
<lb />doing good, and a fear of encouraging evil, she
<lb />weighed each side hastiy, but while still uncertain
	  <lb />which ought to preponderate, her kindness for <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName> interfered, and, in the hope of rescuing her
<lb />husband from further bad practices, she said she
<lb />would postpone her own business for the few days he
<lb />mentioned, rather than see him compelled to open
<lb />any new account with so dangerous a set of men.</p>
<p><lb />He thanked her in his usual negligent manner, and
<lb />accepting the 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. gave her his receipt for it, and a
<lb />promise she should be paid in a week.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, however, seemed more grateful, and
<lb />with many embraces spoke her sense of this friendly
<lb />good-nature.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, happy from believing that she
<lb />had revived in her some spark of sensibility, deter&shy;
<lb />mined to avail herself of so favourable a symptom,
<lb />and enter at once upon the disagreeable task she had
<lb />set herself, of representing to her the danger of her
<lb />present situation.</p>
<p>	  <lb />As soon, therefore, as breakfast was done, and <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName>, who came in before it was over, was gone,
<lb />with a view to excite her attention by raising her cu&shy;
<lb />riosity, she begged the favour of a private conference
<lb />in her own room, upon matters of some importance.</p>
<p><lb />She began with hoping that the friendship in which
<pb n="255" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">251</mw>
<lb />they had so long lived would make her pardon the
<lb />liberty she was going to take, and which nothing less
<lb />than their former intimacy, joined to strong appre&shy;
<lb />hensions for her future welfare, could authorise:
	  <lb /><q>But, oh <persName>Priscilla</persName>!</q> she continued, <q>with open eyes
<lb />to see your danger, yet not warn you of it, would be
<lb />a reserve treacherous in a friend, and cruel even in a
<lb />fellow-creature.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What danger?</q>cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, much alarmed,
<lb /><q>do you think me ill? do I look consumptive?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, consumptive indeed!</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>but not,
<lb />I hope, in your constitution.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, with all the tenderness in her power, she
<lb />came to the point, and conjured her without delay to
<lb />retrench her expences, and change her thoughtless
<lb />way of life for one more considerate and domestic.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, with much simplicity, assured her <emph>she
<lb />did nothing but what every body else did</emph>, and that it
<lb />was quite impossible for her to <emph>appear in the world</emph>
<lb />in any other manner.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>But how are you to appear hereafter?</q> cried <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>, <q>if now you live beyond your income, you must
<lb />consider that, in time, your income by such depreda&shy;
<lb />tions will be exhausted.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But I declare to you,</q> answered <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb /><q>I never run in debt for more than half a year, for as
<lb />soon as I receive my own money, I generally pay it
<lb />away every shilling:  and so borrow what I want till
<lb />pay-day comes round again.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And that,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>seems a method ex&shy;
<lb />pressly devised for keeping you eternally comfortless:
<lb />pardon me, however, for speaking so openly, but I
<lb />fear <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> himself must be even still less atten&shy;
<pb n="256" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">252</mw>
<lb />tive and accurate in his affairs, or he could not so fre&shy;
<lb />quently be embarrassed.  And what is to be the re&shy;
	    <lb />sult? look but, my dear <persName>Priscilla</persName>, a little forward,
<lb />and you will tremble at the prospect before you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> seemed frightened at this speech, and
<lb />begged to know what she would have them do?</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then, with equal wisdom and friendliness,
<lb />proposed a general reform in the household, the public
<lb />and private expences of both:  she advised that a
<lb />strict examination might be made into the state of
<lb />their affairs, that all their bills should be called in,
<lb />and faithfully paid, and that an entire new plan of life
<lb />should be adopted, according to the situation of their
<lb />fortune and income when cleared of all incumbrances.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord, my dear!</q> exclaimed <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, with a
<lb />look of astonishment, <q>why <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> would no
<lb />more do all this than fly!  If I was only to make such
<lb />a proposal, I dare say he would laugh in my face.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And why?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why?&mdash;why because it would seem such an odd
<lb />thing&mdash;it's what nobody thinks of&mdash;though I am sure
<lb />I am very much obliged to you for mentioning it.&sdash;
<lb />Shall we go down stairs?  I think I heard somebody
<lb />come in.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No matter who comes in,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>reflect
<lb />for a moment upon my proposal, and, at least, if you
<lb />disapprove it, suggest something more eligible.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, it's a very good proposal, that I agree,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, looking very weary, <q>but only the thing
<lb />is, it's quite impossible.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why so? why is it impossible?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why because&mdash;dear, I don't know&mdash;but I am
<lb />sure it is.</q></p>
<pb n="257" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">253</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>But what is your reason?  What makes you sure
<lb />of it?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord, I can't tell&mdash;but I know it is&mdash;because&mdash;I
<lb />am very certain it is.</q></p>
<p><lb />Argument such as this, though extremely fatiguing
<lb />to the understanding of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, had yet no power to
<lb /><emph>blunt her purpose;</emph> she warmly expostulated against
<lb />the weakness of her defence, strongly represented the
<lb />imprudence of her conduct, and exhorted her by every
<lb />tie of justice, honour and discretion to set about a re&shy;
<lb />formation.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Why what can I do?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, impa&shy;
<lb />tiently, <q>one must live a little like other people.
<lb />You would not have me be stared at, I suppose; and
<lb />I am sure I don't know what I do that every body
<lb />else does not do too.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But were it not better,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with more
<lb />energy, <q>to think less of <emph>other people</emph> and more of
<lb /><emph>yourself?</emph> to consult your own fortune, and your own
<lb />situation in life, instead of being blindly guided by
<lb />those of <emph>other people?</emph> If, indeed, <emph>other people</emph> would
<lb />be responsible for your losses, for the dimunition of
<lb />your wealth, and for the disorder of your affairs, then
<lb />might you rationally make their way of life the exam&shy;
<lb />ple of yours:  but you cannot flatter yourself such will
<lb />be the case; you know better; your losses, your di&shy;
<lb />minished fortune, your embarrassed circumstances will
<lb />be all your own! pitied, perhaps, by some, but blamed
<lb />by more, and assisted by none!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Good Lord, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>!</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />starting, <q>you talk just as if we were ruined!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I mean not that,</q> replied <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>but I would

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">254</mw>
<lb />fain, by pointing out your danger, prevail with you to
<lb />prevent in time so dreadful catastrophe.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, more affronted than alarmed, heard
<lb />this answer with much displeasure, and after a sullen
<lb />hesitation, peevishly said, <q>I must own I don't take
<lb />it very kind of you to say such frightful things to me:
<lb />I am sure we only live like the rest of the world, and
<lb />I don't see why a man of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s fortune should
<lb />live any worse.  As to his having now and then a
<lb />little debt or two, it is nothing but what every body
<lb />else has.  You only think it so odd, because you
<lb />a'n't used to it:  but you are quite mistaken if you
<lb />suppose he does not mean to pay, for he told me this
<lb />morning, that as soon as ever he receives his rents, he
<lb />intends to discharge every bill he has in the world.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am very glad to hear it,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>and
<lb />I heartily wish he may have the resolution to adhere
<lb />to his purpose.  I feared you would think me imper&shy;
<lb />tinent, but you do worse in believing me unkind;
<lb />friendship and good-will could alone have induced me
<lb />to hazard what I have said to you.  I must, however,
<lb />have done; though I cannot forbear adding that I
<lb />hope what has already passed will sometimes recur
<lb />to you.</q></p>
<p><lb />They then separated; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> half angry at
<lb />remonstrances she thought only censorious, and Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia at her pettishness, and folly, though grieved at
<lb />her blindness.</p>
<p><lb />She was soon, however, recompensed for this vexa&shy;
<lb />tion, by a visit from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, who, finding her
<lb />alone, sat with her some time, and by her spirit, un&shy;
<lb />derstanding and elegance, dissipated all her chagrin.</p>
<pb n="259" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">255</mw>
<p>
<lb />From another circumstance, also, she received
	  <lb />much pleasure, though a little perplexity; <persName>Mr. Ar&shy;
<lb />nott</persName> brought her word that <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, almost
<lb />quite well, had actually left his lodgings, and was
<lb />gone into the country.</p>
<p><lb />She now half suspected that the account of his ill&shy;
	  <lb />ness given her by young <persName>De<sic corr="l"></sic>vile</persName>, was merely the effect
<lb />of his curiosity to discover her sentiments of him; yet
<lb />when she considered how foreign to his character ap&shy;
<lb />peared every species of artifice, she exculpated him
<lb />from the design, and concluded that the impatient
	  <lb />spirit of <persName>Belfield</persName> had hurried him away, when really
<lb />unfit for travelling.  She had no means, however, to
<lb />hear more of him now he had quitted the town, and
<lb />therefore, though uneasy, she was compelled to be
<lb />patient.</p>
<p>	  <lb />In the evening she had again a visit from <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>, who, though he was now acquainted how
<lb />much she was at home, had the forbearance to avoid
<lb />making frequent use of that knowledge, that his
<lb />attendance might escape observation.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, as usual, spoke to him of all her affairs
<lb />with the utmost openness; and as her mind was now
<lb />chiefly occupied by her apprehensions for the Harrels,
<lb />she communicated to him the extravagance of which
<lb />they were guilty, and hinted at the distress that from
<lb />time to time it occasioned; but the assistance she had
<lb />afforded them her own delicacy prevented her men&shy;
<lb />tioning.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> scrupled not from this account in&shy;
<lb />stantly to pronounce Harrel a <emph>ruined man</emph>, and
<lb />thinking <persName>Cecilia</persName>, from her connection with him, in
<lb />much danger of being involved in his future difficul&shy;
<pb n="260" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2I4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">256</mw>
<lb />ties, he most earnestly exhorted her to suffer no in&shy;
<lb />ducement to prevail with her to advance him any
<lb />money, confidently affirming she would have little
<lb />chance of being ever repaid.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> listened to this charge with much alarm,
<lb />but readily promised future circumspection.  She
<lb />confessed to him the conference she had in the morn&shy;
<lb />ing with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and after lamenting her de&shy;
<lb />termined neglect of her affairs, she added, <q>I cannot
<lb />but own that my esteem for her, even more than
<lb />my affection, has lessened almost every day since I
<lb />have been in her house; but this morning, when I
<lb />ventured to speak to her with earnestness, I found
<lb />her powers of reasoning so weak, and her infatua&shy;
<lb />tion to luxury and expence so strong, that I have
<lb />ever since felt ashamed of my own want of discern&shy;
<lb />ment, in having formerly selected her for my friend.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>When you gave her that title,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<lb />ton</persName>, <q>you had little choice in your power; her
<lb />sweetness and good nature attracted you; childhood
<lb />is never troubled with foresight, and youth is seldom
<lb />difficult; she was lively and pleasing, you were
<lb />generous and affectionate; your acquaintance with
<lb />her was formed while you were yet too young to
<lb />know your own worth; your fondness of her grew
<lb />from habit; and before the inferiority of her parts
<lb />had weakened your regard, by offending your judg&shy;
<lb />ment, her early marriage separated you from her
<lb />entirely.  But now you meet again, the scene is
<lb />altered; three years of absence spent in the cultiva&shy;
<lb />tion of an understanding naturally of the first order,
<lb />by encreasing your wisdom, has made you more fasti&shy;
<lb />dious; while the same time spent by her in mere
<pb n="261" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2K1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">257</mw>
<lb />idleness and shew, has hurt her disposition, without
<lb />adding to her knowledge, and robbed her of her
<lb />natural excellencies, without enriching her with
<lb />acquired ones.  You see her now with impartiality,
<lb />for you see her almost as a stranger, and all those
<lb />deficiencies which retirement and inexperience had
<lb />formerly concealed, her vanity, and her superficial
<lb />acquaintance with the world have now rendered
<lb />glaring.  But folly weakens all bands; remember,
<lb />therefore if you would form a solid friendship, to
<lb />consult not only the heart, but the head; not only
<lb />the temper, but the understanding.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">Well, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>at least it must
<lb />be confessed I have judiciously chosen <emph>you!</emph></q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You have, indeed, done me the highest honour,</q>
<lb />he answered.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Then they talked of <persName>Belfield</persName>, and <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>
<lb />confirmed the account of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, that he had
<lb />left <placeName>London</placeName> in good health.  After which, he en&shy;
	  <lb />quired if she had seen any thing more of the <name>Delviles</name>?</p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> called upon
<lb />me this morning.  She is a delightful woman; I am
<lb />sorry you know her not enough to do her justice.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is she civil to you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Civil? she is all kindness!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Then depend upon it she has something in view:
<lb />whenever that is not the case, she is all insolence.
	    <lb />And <persName>Mr. De<sic corr="l"></sic>vile</persName>&mdash;pray what do you think of
<lb />him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">O, I think him insufferable! and I cannot suffi&shy;
<lb />ciently thank you for that timely caution which pre&shy;
<lb />vented my change of habitation. I<sic corr="&amp;blank;"></sic>would not live
<lb />under the same roof with him for the world.</q></p>

<p>
<lb /><q>Well, and do you not now begin also to see the
<lb />son properly</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Properly?  I don't understand you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why as the very son of such parents, haughty
<lb />and impertinent.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, indeed; he has not the smallest resem&shy;
<lb />blance of his father, and if he resembles his mother,
<lb />it is only what every one must wish who impartially
<lb />sees her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You know not the family.  But how, indeed,
<lb />should you, when they are in a combination to pre&shy;
<lb />vent your getting that knowledge?  They have all
<lb />their designs upon you, and if you are not carefully
<lb />upon your guard, you will be the dupe to them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What can you possibly mean?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nothing but what every body else must imme&shy;
<lb />diately see; they have a great share of pride, and
<lb />a small one of wealth; you seem by fortune to be
<lb />flung in their way, and doubtless they mean not to
<lb />neglect so inviting an opportunity of repairing their
<lb />estates.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed you are mistaken; I am certain they
<lb />have no such intention:  on the contrary, they all
<lb />even teasingly persist in thinking me already en&shy;
<lb />gaged elsewhere.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then gave a history of their several suspicions.
<lb /><q>The impertinence of report,</q> she added, <q>has so
<lb />much convinced them that <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> and
<lb /><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> fought merely as rivals, that I can only
<lb />clear myself of partiality for one of them, to have it
<lb />instantly concluded I feel it for the other.  And, far
<lb />from seeming hurt that I appear to be disposed of,
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> openly seconds the pretentions of <persName>Sir

<lb />Robert</persName>, and his son officiously persuades me that I
<lb />am already <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>'s.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Tricks, nothing but tricks to discover your real
<lb />situation.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then gave her some general cautions to be upon
<lb />her guard against their artifices, and changing the
<lb />subject, talked, for the rest of his visit, upon matters
<lb />of general entertainment.</p></div>

	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Cecilia</hi> now for about a fortnight passed her
	  <lb />time without incident:  the <name>Harrels</name> continued their
<lb />accustomed dissipation, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, without
<lb />even seeking a private conference, persevered in his
<lb />attentions, and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, though still silent and
<lb />humble, seemed only to live by the pleasure of be&shy;

<lb />Delvile</persName>, both of which served to confirm her admi&shy;
<lb />ration of that lady and her son; and she joined the
<lb />parties of the Harrels, or stayed quietly at home,
<lb />according to her spirits and inclination:  while she
<lb />was visited by <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> often enough to satisfy
<lb />him with her proceeding, yet too seldom to betray
<lb />either to herself or to the world any suspicions of
<lb />his designs.</p>

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">260</mw>
<p>
<lb />Her 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. however, which was to have been re&shy;
<lb />turned at the end of the first week though a fortnight
<lb />had now elapsed, had not even been mentioned:  she
<lb />began to grow very impatient, but not knowing
<lb />what course to pursue, and wanting courage to re&shy;
<lb />mind <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> of his promise, she still waited
<lb />the performance of it without speaking.</p>
<p><lb />At this time, preparations were making in the
	  <lb />family to remove to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>, to spend the Easter
<lb />holidays:  but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was too much grieved at
<lb />such perpetual encrease of unnecessary expenses to
<lb />have any enjoyment in new prospects of entertain&shy;
<lb />ment, had at present some business of her own which
<lb />gave her full employment.</p>
<p><lb />The poor carpenter, whose family she had taken
<lb />under her protection, was just dead, and, as soon
<lb />as the last duties had been paid him, she sent for his
<lb />widow, and after trying to console her for the loss
<lb />she had suffered, assured her she was immediately
<lb />ready to fulfil the engagement into which she had
<lb />entered, of assisting her to undertake some better
<lb />method of procuring a livelihood:  and therefore de&shy;
<lb />sired to know in what manner she could serve her,
<lb />and what she thought herself able to do.</p>
<p><lb />The good woman, pouring forth thanks and
<lb />praises innumerable, answered that she had a cousin
<lb />who had offered, for a certain premium, to take her
<lb />into partnership in a small haberdasher's shop.
<lb /><q>But then, madam,</q> continued she, <q>its quite
<lb />morally impossible I should raise such a sum, or else,
<lb />to be sure, such a shop as that, now I am grown so
<lb />poorly, would be quite a heaven upon earth to me:
<lb />for my strength, madam, is almost all gone away,
<pb n="265" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2K3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">261</mw>
<lb />and when I do any hard work, it's quite a piteous
<lb />sight to see me, for I am all in a tremble after it,
<lb />just as if I had an ague, and yet all the time my
<lb />hands, madam, will be burning like a coal.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You have indeed been overworked,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>and it is high time your feeble frame should have
<lb />some rest.  What is the sum your cousin demands?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O madam, more than I shall be able to get to&shy;
<lb />gether in all my life! for earn what I will, it goes as
<lb />fast as it comes, because there's many mouths and
<lb />small pay, and two of the little ones that can't help
<lb />at all;&mdash;and there's no Billy, madam, to work for
<lb />us now!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But tell me, what is the sum?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Sixty pound, madam.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You shall have it!</q> cried the generous <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>if the situation will make you happy, I will give
<lb />it you myself.</q></p>
<p><lb />The poor woman wept her thanks, and was long
<lb />before she could sufficiently compose herself to
<lb />answer the further questions of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who next
<lb />enquired what could be done with the children?
	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, however, hitherto hopeless of such a
<lb />provision for herself, had for them formed no plan.
<lb />She told her, therefore, to go to her cousin, and
<lb />consult upon this subject, as well as to make prepa<sic corr="ra"></sic>&shy;
<lb />tions for her own removal.</p>
<p><lb />The arrangement of this business now became her
<lb />favourite occupation.  She went herself to the shop,
<lb />which was a very small one in the Fetter-lane, and spoke
	  <lb />with <persName>Mrs. Roberts</persName>, the cousin; who agreed to take
<lb />the eldest girl, now sixteen years of age, by way of
<lb />helper; but she said she had room for no other:
<pb n="266" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2K3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">262</mw>
<lb />however, upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s offering to raise the premium,
<lb />she consented that the two children should also live
<lb />in the house, where they might be under the care of
<lb />their mother and sister.</p>
<p><lb />There were still two others to be disposed of; but
<lb />as no immediate method of providing for them
<lb />occurred to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, she determined for the present,
<lb />to place them in some cheap school, where they
<lb />might be taught plain work, which could not but
<lb />prove a useful qualification for whatever sort of
<lb />business they might hereafter attempt.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Her plan was to bestow upon <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> and her
<lb />children 100<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. by way of putting them all into a de&shy;
<lb />cent way of living; and then, from time to time, to
<lb />make them such small presents as their future exi&shy;
<lb />gencies, or changes of situation might require.</p>
<p><lb />Now, therefore, payment from <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> became
<lb />immediately necessary, for she had only 50<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. of the
<lb />600<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. she had taken up in her own possession, and
<lb />her customary allowance was already so appropriated
<lb />that she could make from it no considerable deduction.</p>
<p><lb />There is something in the sight of laborious indi&shy;
<lb />gence so affecting and so respectable, that it renders
<lb />dissipation peculiarly contemptible, and doubles the
<lb />odium of extravagance; every time <persName>Cecilia</persName> saw this
<lb />poor family, her aversion to the conduct and princi&shy;
<lb />ples of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> encreased, while her delicacy of
<lb />shocking or shaming him diminished, and she soon
<lb />acquired for them, what she had failed to acquire
<lb />for herself, the spirit and resolution to claim her
<lb />debt.</p>
<p><lb />One morning, therefore, as he was quitting the
<lb />breakfast room, she hastily arose, and following,
<pb n="267" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2K4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">263</mw>
<lb />begged to have a moment's discourse with him.
<lb />They went together to the library, and after some
<lb />apologies, and much hesitation, she fancied he had
<lb />forgotten the 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. which she had lent him.</p>
<p><lb /><q>The 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>.</q> cried he; <q>O, aye, true!&mdash;I pro&shy;
<lb />test it had escaped me.  Well, but you don't want
<lb />it immediately?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed I do, if you can conveniently spare it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O yes, certainly!&mdash;without the least doubt!&mdash;
<lb />Though now I think of it&mdash;it's extremely unlucky,
<lb />but really just at this time&mdash;why did not you put me
<lb />in mind of it before?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hoped you would have remembered it yourself?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I could have paid you two days ago extremely
<lb />well;&mdash;however, you shall certainly have it very
<lb />soon, that you may depend upon, and a day or two
<lb />can make no difference to you.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then wished her a good morning, and left her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, very much provoked, regretted that she
<lb />had ever lent it at all, and determined for the future
<lb />strictly to follow the advice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> in
<lb />trusting him no more.</p>
<p><lb />Two or three days passed on, but still no notice
<lb />was taken either of the payment or the debt.  She
<lb />then resolved to renew her application, and be more
<lb />serious and more urgent with him; but she found, to
<lb />her utter surprise, this was not in her power, and
<lb />that though she lived under the same roof with him,
	  <lb />she had no opportunity to enforce her claim.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, whenever she desired to speak with him,
<lb />protested he was so much hurried, he had not a
<lb />moment to spare; and even when, tired of his ex&shy;
<lb />cuses, she pursued him out of the room, he only
<pb n="268" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2K4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">264</mw>
<lb />quickened his speed, smiling, however, and bowing,
<lb />and calling out <q>I am vastly sorry, but I am so
<lb />late now I cannot stop an instant; however, as soon
<lb />as I come back, I shall be wholly at your command.</q></p>
<p><lb />When he came back, however, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>,
<lb />or some other gentleman was sure to be with him,
<lb />and the difficulties of obtaining an audience were
<lb />sure to be encreased.  And by this method, which he
<lb />constantly practised, of avoiding any private conver&shy;
<lb />sation, he frustrated all her schemes of remonstrating
<lb />upon his delay, since her resentment, however great,
<lb />could never urge her to the indelicacy of dunning
<lb />him in presence of a third person.</p>
<p><lb />She was now much perplexed how to put into exe&shy;
	  <lb />cution her plan for the <name>Hills</name>:  she knew it would be
<lb />in vain to apply for money to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.  Her
<lb />word, however, had been given, and her word she
<lb />held sacred:  she resolved, therefore, for the present,
<lb />to bestow upon them the 50<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. she still retained, and,
<lb />if the rest should be necessary before she became of
<lb />age, to spare it, however inconveniently, from her
<lb />private allowance, which, by the will of her uncle,
<lb />was 500<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. a year, 250<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. of which
<persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> received
<lb />for her board and accommodations.</p>
<p><lb />Having settled this matter in her own mind, she
	  <lb />went to the lodging of <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, in order to conclude
<lb />the affair.  She found her and all the children,
<lb />except the youngest, hard at work, and their honest
<lb />industry so much strengthened her compassion, that
<lb />her wishes for serving them grew every instant more
<lb />liberal.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> readily undertook to make her cousin
<lb />accept the premium for the present, which would
<pb n="269" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">265</mw>
<lb />suffice to fix her, with three of her children, in the
<lb />shop:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> then went with her to Fetter-lane,
<lb />and there drawing up herself an agreement for their
<lb />entering into partnership, she made each of them
<lb />sign it and take a copy, and kept a third in her own
<lb />possession:  after which she gave a promissory note to
	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Roberts</persName> for the rest of the money.</p>
<p>	  <lb />She presented <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, also, with 10<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. to clothe
<lb />them all decently, and enable her to send two of
<lb />the children to school:  and assured her that she would
<lb />herself pay for their board and instruction, till she
<lb />should be established in her business, and have power
<lb />to save money for that purpose.</p>
<p><lb />She then put herself into a chair to return home,
<lb />followed by the prayers and blessings of the whole
<lb />family.</p></div>

<p><lb /><q>I already have!</q> returned he, indignantly, <q>and
<lb />already I have found you faulty!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am sorry to hear it,</q> said the amazed <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb /><q>but at least I hope you will tell me in what?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You refused me admittance,</q> he answered, <q>yet
<lb />I was your friend, yet I was willing to prolong the
<lb />term of your genuine tranquility!  I pointed out to
<lb />you a method of preserving peace with your own
<lb />soul; I came to you in behalf of the poor, and
<pb n="271" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">267</mw>
<lb />instructed you how to merit their prayers; you heard
<lb />me, you were susceptible, you complied!  I meant
<lb />to have repeated the lesson, to have turned your
<lb />whole heart to compassion, and to have taught you
<lb />the sad duties of sympathising humanity.  For this
<lb />purpose I called again, but again I was not admitted!
<lb />Short was the period of my absence, yet long enough
<lb />for the completion of your downfall!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Good heaven,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>how dreadful is
<lb />this language! when have you called, Sir?  I never
<lb />heard you had been at the house.  Far from refusing
<lb />you admittance, I wished to see you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed?</q> cried he, with some softness, <q>and
<lb />are you, in truth, not proud? not callous? not hard
<lb />of heart?  Follow me, then, and visit the humble
<lb />and the poor, follow me, and give comfort to the
<lb />fallen and dejected!</q></p>
<p><lb />At this invitation, however desirous to do good,
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> started; the strangeness of the inviter, his
<lb />flightiness, his authoritative manner, and the un&shy;
<lb />certainty whither or to whom he might carry her,
<lb />made her fearful of proceeding; yet a benevolent
<lb />curiosity to see as well as serve the objects of his
<lb />recom<sic corr="m"></sic>endation, joined to the eagerness of youthful
<lb />integrity to clear her own character from the asper&shy;
<lb />sion of hard-heartedness, soon conquered her resolu&shy;
<lb />tion, and making a sign to her servant to keep near
<lb />her, she followed as her conductor led her.</p>
<p><lb />He went on silently and solemnly till he came to
	  <lb /><placeName>Swallow-street</placeName>, then turning into it, he stopt at a
<lb />small and mean looking house, knocked at the door,
<lb />and without asking any question of the man who
<pb n="272" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">268</mw>
<lb />opened it, beckoned her to come after him, and
<lb />hastened up some narrow winding stairs.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> again hesitated; but when she recollected
<lb />that this old man, though little known, was frequently
<lb />seen, and though with few people acquainted, was
<lb />by many personally recognized, she thought it im&shy;
<lb />possible he could mean her any injury.  She ordered
<lb />her servant, however, to come in, and bid him keep
<lb />walking up and down stairs till she returned to him.
<lb />And then she obeyed the directions of her guide.</p>
<p><lb />He proceeded till he came to the second floor, then
<lb />again beckoning her to follow him, he opened a door,
<lb />and entered a small and a very meanly furnished
<lb />apartment.</p>
<p><lb />And here, to her infinite astonishment, she per&shy;
<lb />ceived, employed in washing some china, a very
<lb />lovely young woman, genteelly dressed, and appear&shy;
<lb />ing hardly seventeen years of age.</p>
<p><lb />The moment they came in, with evident marks of
<lb />confusion, she instantly gave over her work, hastily
<lb />putting the basin, she was washing upon the table,
<lb />and endeavouring to hide the towel with which she
<lb />was wiping it, behind the chair.</p>
<p><lb />The old gentleman advancing to her with quickness,
<lb />said, <q>How is he now? is he better? will he live?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Heaven forbid he should not!</q> answered the
<lb />young woman with emotion, <q>but indeed he is no
<lb />better!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Look here,</q> said he pointing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I have
<lb />brought you one who has power to serve you, and to
<lb />relieve your distress:  one who is rolling in affluence,
<lb />a stranger to ill, a novice in the world;&mdash;unskilled in
<lb />the miseries she is yet to endure, uncon<sic corr="s"></sic>cious of the
<pb n="273" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">269</mw>
<lb />depravity into which she is to sink!&mdash;Receive her
<lb />benefaction while she is yet untainted, satisfied that
<lb />while she aids you, she is blessing herself!</q></p>
<p><lb />The young woman, blushing and abashed, said,
<lb /><q>You are very good to me, Sir, but there is no occa&shy;
<lb />sion&mdash;there is no need&mdash;I have not any necessity&mdash;I
<lb />am far from being so very much in want.&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="OM9">Poor simple soul!</q> interrupted the old man,
<lb /><q id="OM10">and art thou ashamed of poverty?  Guard, guard
<lb />thyself from other shames, and the wealthiest may
<lb />envy thee!  Tell here thy story, plainly, roundly,
<lb />truly:  abate nothing of thy indigence, repress nothing
<lb />of her liberality.  The poor, not impoverished by
<lb />their own guilt, are equals of the affluent, not enriched
<lb />by their own virtue.  Come, then, and let me present
<lb />ye to each other! young as ye both are, with many
<lb />years and many sorrows to encounter, lighten the bur&shy;
<lb />then of each other's cares, by the heart-soothing ex&shy;
<lb />change of gratitude for beneficence!</q></p>
<p><lb />He then took a hand of each, and joining them be&shy;
<lb />tween his own, <q rend="slant(italic)">You,</q> he continued, <q>who though
<lb />rich, are not hardened, and <emph>you</emph>, who though poor, are
<lb />not debased, why should ye not love, why should ye
<lb />not cherish each other?  The afflictions of life are te&shy;
<lb />dious, its joys are evanescent; ye are now both young,
<lb />and with little to enjoy, will find much to suffer.  Ye
<lb />are both too, I believe, innocent&mdash;Oh could ye always
<lb />remain so!&mdash;Cherubs were ye then, and the sons of
<lb />men might worship you!</q></p>
<p><lb />He stopt, checked by his own rising emotion; but
<lb />soon resuming his usual austerity, <q>Such, however,</q>
<lb />he continued, <q>is the condition of humanity; in
<lb />pity, therefore, to the evils impending over both, be
<pb n="274" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">270</mw>
<lb />kind to each other!  I leave you together, and to
<lb />your mutual tenderness I recommend you!</q></p>
<p><lb />Then turning particularly to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>Disdain
<lb />not,</q> he said, <q>to console the depressed; look upon
<lb />her without scorn, converse with her, without con&shy;
<lb />tempt:  like you, she is an orphan, though not, like
<lb />you, an heiress;&mdash;like her you are fatherless, though
<lb />not like her friendless!  If <emph>she</emph> is awaited by the temp&shy;
<lb />tations of adversity, <emph>you</emph>, also, are surrounded by the
<lb />corruptions of prosperity.  Your fall is most probable,
<lb />her's most excusable;&mdash;commis<sic corr="">s</sic>erate <emph>her</emph> therefore
<lb />now,&mdash;by and by she may commiserate <emph>you?</emph></q></p>
<p><lb />And with these words he left the room.</p>
<p><lb />A total silence for some time succeeded his depar&shy;
<lb />ture:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> found it difficult to recover from the
<lb />surprise into which she had been thrown sufficiently
<lb />for speech; in following her extraordinary director,
<lb />her imagination had painted to her a scene such as
<lb />she had so lately quitted, and prepared her to behold
<lb />some family in distress, some helpless creature in sick&shy;
<lb />ness, or some children in want; but of these to see
<lb />none, to meet but one person, and that one fair,
<lb />young, and delicate,&mdash;an introduction so singular to
<lb />an object so unthought of, deprived her of all power
<lb />but that of shewing her amazement.</p>
<p><lb />Mean while the young woman looked scarcely less
<lb />surprised, and infinitely more embarrassed.  She
<lb />surveyed her apartment with vexation, and her guest
<lb />with confusion; she had listened to the exhortation
<lb />of the old man with visible uneasiness, and now he
<lb />was gone, seemed overwhelmed with shame and
<lb />chagrin.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who in observing these emotions felt both
<pb n="275" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">271</mw>
<lb />her curiosity and her compassion increase, pressed her
<lb />hand as she parted with it, and, when a little reco&shy;
<lb />vered, said, <q>You must think this a strange intrusion;
<lb />but the gentleman who brought me hither is perhaps
<lb />so well known to you, as to make his singularities
<lb />plead with you their own apology.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, indeed, madam,</q> she answered bashfully,
<lb /><q>he is very little known to me; but he is very good,
<lb />and very desirous to do me service:&mdash;not but what I
<lb />believe he thinks me much worse off than I really am,
<lb />for, I assure you, madam, whatever he has said, I am
<lb />not ill off at all&mdash;hardly.</q></p>
<p><lb />The various doubts to her disadvantage which had
<lb />at first, from her uncommon situation, arisen in the
<lb />mind of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, this anxiety to disguise, not display
<lb />her distress, considerably removed, since it cleared
<lb />her of all suspicion of seeking by artifice and imposi&shy;
<lb />tion to play upon her feelings.</p>
<p><lb />With a gentleness, therefore, the most soothing,
<lb />she replied, <q>I should by no means have broken in
<lb />upon you thus unexpectedly, if I had not concluded
<lb />my conductor had some right to bring me.  However,
<lb />since we are actually met, let us remember his injunc&shy;
<lb />tions, and endeavour not to part, till, by a mutual
<lb />exchange of good-will, each has added a friend to the
<lb />other.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are condescending indeed, madam,</q> answered
<lb />the young woman, with an air the most humble,
<lb /><q>looking as you look, to talk of a friend when you
<lb />come to such a place as this! up two pair of stairs!
<lb />no furniture! no servant! every thing in such dis&shy;
	    <lb />order!&mdash;indeed I wonder at <persName>Mr. Albany</persName>! he should
<lb />not&mdash;&mdash;but he thinks every body's affairs may be made
<pb n="276" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2L4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">272</mw>
<lb />public, and does not care what he tells, nor who hears
<lb />him;&mdash;he knows not the pain he gives, nor the mis&shy;
<lb />chief he may do.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am very much concerned,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, more
<lb />and more surprised at all she heard, <q>to find I have
<lb />been thus instrumental to distressing you.  I was ig&shy;
<lb />norant whither I was coming, and followed him, be&shy;
<lb />lieve me, neither from curiosity nor inclination, but
<lb />simply because I knew not how to refuse him.  He is
<lb />gone, however, and I will therefore relieve you by
<lb />going too:  but permit me to leave behind me a small
<lb />testimony that the intention of my coming was not
<lb />mere impertinence.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then took out her purse; but the young woman,
<lb />starting back with a look of resentful mortification,
<lb />exclaimed, <q>No, madam! you are quite mistaken;
	    <lb />pray put up your purse; I am no beggar!  <persName>Mr. Al&shy;
<lb />bany</persName> has misrepresented me, if he has told you I am.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, mortified in her turn at this unexpected re&shy;
<lb />jection of an offer she had thought herself invited to
<lb />make, stood some moments silent; and then said, <q>I
<lb />am far from meaning to offend you, and I sincerely
<lb />beg your pardon if I have misunderstood the charge
<lb />just now given to me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre()post(&amp;rdquo;)">I have nothing to pardon, madam,</q> said she more
	  <lb />calmly, <q>except, indeed, to <persName>Mr. Albany</persName>; and to him,
<lb />'tis of no use to be angry, for he minds not what I say;
<lb />he is very good, but he is very strange, for he thinks
<lb />the whole world made to live in common, and that
<lb />every one who is poor should ask, and every one who
<lb />is rich should give:  he does not know that there are
<lb />many who would rather starve.</q></p>
<pb n="277" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">273</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q> And you,</q>said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, half-smiling, <q>
<lb />are of that number?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, indeed, madam!  I have not so much great&shy;
<lb />ness of mind.  But those to whom I belong have more
<lb />fortitude and higher spirit.  I wish I could imitate
<lb />them!</q></p>
<p><lb />Struck with the candour and simplicity of this
<lb />speech, <persName>Cecilia</persName> now felt a warm desire to serve her,
<lb />and taking her hand, said, <q>Forgive me; but though
<lb />I see you wish me gone, I know not how to leave you:
<lb />recollect, therefore, the charge that has been given to
<lb />us both, and if you refuse my assistance one way,
<lb />point out to me in what other I may offer it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are very kind, madam,</q> she answered, <q>and
<lb />I dare say you are very good; I am sure you look so,
<lb />at least.  But I want nothing; I do very well, and I
	    <lb />have hopes of doing better.  <persName>Mr. Albany</persName> is too impa&shy;
<lb />tient.  He knows, indeed, that I am not extremely
<lb />rich, but he is much to blame if he supposes me there&shy;
<lb />fore an object of charity, and thinks me so mean as to
<lb />receive money from a stranger.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am truly sorry,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>for the error I
<lb />have committed, but you must suffer me to make my
<lb />peace with you before we part; yet, till I am better
<lb />known to you, I am fearful of proposing terms.  Per&shy;
<lb />haps you will permit me to leave you my direction,
<lb />and do me the favour to call upon me yourself?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no, madam!  I have a sick relation whom I can&shy;
<lb />not leave:  and indeed, if he were well, he would not
<lb />like to have me make an acquaintance while I am in
<lb />this place.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope you are not his only nurse?  I am sure

<lb />you do not look able to bear such fatigue.  Has he a
<lb />physician?  Is he properly attended?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Madam; he has no physician, and no attend&shy;
<lb />ance at all!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And is it possible that in such a situation you can
<lb />refuse to be assisted?  Surely you should accept
<lb />some help for him, if not for yourself.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But what will that signify, when, if I do, he will
<lb />not make use of it? and when he had a thousand
<lb />and a thousand times rather die, than let any one know
<lb />he is in want?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Take it, then, unknown to him; serve him without
<lb />acquainting him you serve him.  Surely you would
<lb />not suffer him to perish without aid?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Heaven forbid!  But what can I do?  I am under
<lb />his command, madam, not he under mine?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is he your father?&mdash;&mdash;Pardon my question, but
<lb />your youth seems much to want a protector.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, madam, I have no father!  I was happier
<lb />when I had!  He is my brother.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And what is his illness?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A fever.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A fever, and without a physician?  Are you sure,
<lb />too, it is not infectious?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O yes, too sure!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Too sure? how so?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Because I know too well the occasion of it!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And what is the occasion?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, again
<lb />taking her hand, <q>pray trust me; indeed you shall
<lb />not repeat your confidence.  Your reserve hitherto
<lb />has only raised you in my esteem, but do not carry it
<lb />so far as to mortify me by a total rejection of my good
<lb />offices.</q></p>
<pb n="279" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">275</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>Ah madam!</q> said the young woman, sighing,
<lb /><q>you ought to be good, I am sure, for you will draw
<lb />all out of me by such kindness as this! the occasion
<lb />was a neglected wound, never properly healed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A wound? is he in the army?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No,&mdash;he was shot through the side in a duel.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>In a duel?</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>pray what is
<lb />his name?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O that I must not tell you! his name is a great
<lb />secret now, while he is in this poor place; for I know
<lb />he had almost rather never see the light again than
<lb />have it known.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Surely,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with much emotion,
<lb /><q>he cannot&mdash;I hope he cannot be <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah heaven!</q> cried the young woman, screaming,
<lb /><q>do you know him?</q></p>
<p><lb />Here, in mutual astonishment, they looked at each
<lb />other.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>You are then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>the sister of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Belfield</persName>? and <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, is thus sick, his wound is
<lb />not yet healed,&mdash;and he is without help!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And who, madam, are <emph>you?</emph></q> cried she, <q>and
<lb />how is it you know him?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>My name is <persName>Beverley</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah!</q> exclaimed she again,<q>I fear I have done
<lb />nothing but mischief!  I know very well who you are
<lb />now, madam; but if my brother discovers that I have
<lb />betrayed him, he will take it very unkind, and perhaps
<lb />never forgive me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Be not alarmed,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>rest assured
<lb />he shall never know it.  Is he not now in the coun&shy;
<lb />try?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, madam, he is now in the very next room.</q></p>
<pb n="280" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">276</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>But what is become of the surgeon who used to
<lb />attend him, and why does he not still visit him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It is in vain, now, to hide any thing from you;
<lb />my brother deceived him, and said he was going out
<lb />of town merely to get rid of him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And what could induce him to act so strangely?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A reason which you, madam, I hope, will never
<lb />know, Poverty!&mdash;he would not run up a bill he could
<lb />not pay.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Good heaven!&mdash;but what can be done for him?
<lb />he must not be suffered to linger thus; we must con&shy;
<lb />trive some method of relieving and assisting him, whe&shy;
<lb />ther he will consent or not.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I fear that will not be possible.  One of his friends
<lb />has already found him out, and has written him the
<lb />kindest letter!  but he would not answer it, and would
<lb />not see him, and was only fretted and angry.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I will not keep you longer,
<lb />lest he should be alarmed by your absence.  To-mor&shy;
<lb />row morning, with your leave, I will call upon you
<lb />again, and then I hope you will permit me to make
<lb />some effort to assist you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>If it only depended upon me, madam,</q> she an&shy;
<lb />swered, <q>now I have the honour to know who you
<lb />are, I believe I should not make such scruple; for I
<lb />was not brought up to notions so high as my brother.
<lb />Ah! happy had it been for him, for me, for all his
<lb />family, if he had not had them neither!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then repeated expressions of comfort and
<lb />kindness, and took her leave.</p>
<p><lb />This little adventrue gave her infinite concern; all
<lb />the horror which the duel had originally occasioned
<lb />her, again returned; she accued herself with much
<pb n="281" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">277</mw>
<lb />bitterness for having brought it on; and finding that
<lb /><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> was so cruelly a sufferer both in his
<lb />health and his affairs, she thought it incumbent upon
<lb />her to relieve him to the utmost of her ability.</p>
<p><lb />Her sister, too, had extremely interested her; her
<lb />youth, and the uncommon artlessness of her conversa&shy;
<lb />tion, added to her melancholy situation, and the love&shy;
<lb />liness of her person, excited in her a desire to serve,
<lb />and an inclination to love her; and she determined,
<lb />if she found her as deserving as she seemed engaging,
<lb />not only to assist her at present, but, if her distresses
<lb />continued, to receive her into her own house in
<lb />future.</p>
<p><lb />Again she regretted the undue detension of her 200<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>.
<lb />What she now had to spare was extremely inadequate
<lb />to what she now wished to bestow, and she looked
<lb />forward to the conclusion of her minority with en&shy;
<lb />creasing eagerness.  The generous and elegant plan
<lb />of life she then intended to pursue, daily gained
<lb />ground in her imagination, and credit in her opinion.</p></div>

<milestone unit="sig" n="2M3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">278</mw>
	  <lb />quired for <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, and was told to go up stairs:
<lb />but what was her amazement to meet, just coming out
<lb />of the room into which she was entering, young Del&shy;
<lb />vile!</p>
<p><lb />They both started, and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, from the seeming
<lb />strangeness of her situation, felt a confusion with
	  <lb />which she had hitherto been unacquainted.  But <persName>Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>, presently recovering from his surprise, said to
	  <lb />her, with an expressive smile, <q>How good is <persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName> thus to visit the sick! and how much better
<lb />might I have had the pleasure of seeing <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<lb />had I but, by prescience, known her design, and de&shy;
<lb />ferred my own enquiries till he had been revived by
<lb />her's!</q></p>
<p><lb />And then bowing, and wishing her good morning, he
<lb />glided past her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, notwithstanding the openness and purity of
<lb />her intentions, was so much disconcerted by this un&shy;
<lb />expected meeting, and pointed speech, that she had
<lb />not the presence of mind to call him back and clear
<lb />herself; and the various interrogatories and railleries
<lb />which had already passed between them upon the
<lb />subject of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, made her suppose that what
<lb />he had formerly suspected he would now think con&shy;
<lb />firmed, and conclude that all her assertions of indif&shy;
<lb />ference, proceeded merely from that readiness at hy&shy;
<lb />pocrisy upon particular subjects, of which he had
<lb />openly accused her whole Sex.</p>
<p><lb />This circumstance and this apprehension took from
<lb />her for a while all interest in the errand upon which
<lb />she came; but the benevolence of her heart soon
<lb />brought it back, when, upon going into the room, she
<lb />saw her new favourite in tears.</p>

<p>
<lb /><q>What is the matter!</q> cried she, tenderly; <q>no
<lb />new affliction I hope has happened?  Your brother is
<lb />not worse?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, madam, he is much the same; I was not cry&shy;
<lb />ing for him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>For what then? tell me, acquaint me with your
<lb />sorrows, and assure yourself you tell them to a friend.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I was crying, madam, to find so much goodness
<lb />in the world, when I thought there was so little! to
<lb />find I have some chance of being again happy, when I
<lb />thought I was miserable for ever!  Two whole years
<lb />have I spent in nothing but unhappiness, and I
<lb />thought there was nothing else to be had; but yester&shy;
<lb />day, madam, brought me <emph>you</emph>, with every promise of
<lb />nobleness and protection; and to-day a friend of my
<lb />brother's has behaved so generously, that even my bro&shy;
<lb />ther has listened to him, and almost consented to be
<lb />obliged to him!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And have you already known so much sorrow,</q>
<lb />said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that this little dawn of prosperity
<lb />should wholly overpower your spirits?  Gentle, amia&shy;
<lb />ble girl! may the future recompense you for the past,
	    <lb />and may <persName>Mr. Albany's</persName> kind wishes be fulfilled in the
<lb />reciprocation of our comfort and affliction.</q></p>
<p><lb />They then entered into a conversation which the
	  <lb />sweetness of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and the gratitude of <persName>Miss Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName>, soon rendered interesting, friendly and unre&shy;
<lb />served:  and in a very short time, whatever was essen&shy;
<lb />tial in the story or situation of the latter was fully
<lb />communicated.  She gave, however, a charge the
<lb />most earnest, that her brother should never be ac&shy;
<lb />quainted with the confidence she had made.</p>
<p><lb />Her father who had been dead only two years, was
<pb n="284" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2M4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">280</mw>
<lb />a linen-draper in the city; he had six daughters, of
<lb />whom herself was the youngest, and only one son.
<lb />This son, <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, was alike the darling of his
<lb />father, mother, and sisters:  he was brought up at
<lb />Eaton, no expence was spared in his education, no&shy;
<lb />thing was denied that could make him happy.  With
<lb />an excellent understanding he had uncommon quick&shy;
<lb />ness of parts, and his progress in his studies were
<lb />rapid and honourable:  his father, though he always
<lb />menat him for his successor in his business, heard of
<lb />his improvements with rapture, often saying, <q>My
<lb />boy will be the ornament of the city, he will be the
<lb />best scholar in any shop in <placeName>London</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb />He was soon, however, taught another lesson;
<lb />when, at the age of sixteen, he returned home, and
<lb />was placed in the shop, instead of applying his talents
<lb />as his father had expected, to trade, he both despised
<lb />and abhorred the name of it; when serious, treating
<lb />it with contempt, when gay, with derision.</p>
<p><lb />He was seized, also, with a most ardent desire to fi&shy;
<lb />nish his education, like those of his school-fellows who
	  <lb />left <name>Eaton</name> at the same time, at one of the Universities;
<lb />and, after many difficulties, this petition, at the inter&shy;
<lb />cession of his mother, was granted, old <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>
<lb />telling him he hoped a little more learning would
<lb />give him a little more sense, and that when he became
<lb />a <emph>finished student</emph>, he would not only know the true
<lb />value of business, but understand how to get money,
<lb />and make a bargain, better than any man whatsoever
<lb />within Temple-Bar.</p>
<p><lb />These expectations, equally short-sighted, were
<lb />also equally fallacious with the former:  the son again
<lb />returned, and returned, as his father had hoped, a
<pb n="285" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">281</mw>
<lb /><emph>finished student;</emph> but, far from being more tractable,
<lb />or better disposed for application to trade, his aver&shy;
<lb />sion to it now was more stubborn, and his opposition
<lb />more hardy than ever.  The young men of fashion
<lb />with whom he had formed friendships at school, or at
<lb />the university, and with whom, from the indulgence
<lb />of his father, he was always able to vie in expence,
<lb />and from the indulgence of nature to excel in capa&shy;
<lb />city, earnestly sought the continuance of his acquaint&shy;
<lb />ance, and courted and coveted the pleasure of his
<lb />conversation:  but though he was now totally disquali&shy;
<lb />fied for any other society, he lost all delight in
<lb />their favour from the fear they should discover his
<lb />abode, and sedulously endeavoured to avoid even oc&shy;
<lb />casionally meeting them, lest any of his family should
<lb />at the same time approach him:  for of his family,
<lb />though wealthy, worthy, and independent, he was
<lb />now so utterly ashamed, that the mortification the
<lb />most cruel he could receive, was to be asked his
<lb />address, or told he should be visited.</p>
<p><lb />Tired, at length, of evading the enquiries made by
<lb />some, and forcing faint laughs at the detection made
<lb />by others, he privately took a lodging at the west end
<lb />of the town, to which he thenceforward directed all
<lb />his friends, and where, under various pretences, he
<lb />contrived to spend the greatest part of his time.</p>
<p><lb />In all his expensive deceits and frolics, his mother
<lb />was his never-failing confident and assistant; for when
<lb />she heard that the companions of her son were men of
<lb />fashion, some born to titles, others destined to high
<lb />stations, she concluded he was in the certain road to
<lb />honour and profit, and frequently distressed herself,
<lb />without ever repining, in order to enable him to pre&shy;
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">12.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">2N</mw>
<pb n="286" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">282</mw>
<lb />serve upon equal terms, connections which she be&shy;
<lb />lieved so conducive to his future grandeur.</p>
<p><lb />In this wild and unsettled manner he passed some
<lb />time, struggling incessantly against the authority of
<lb />his father, privately abetted by his mother, and con&shy;
<lb />stantly aided and admired by his sisters:  till, sick of
<lb />so desultory a way of life, he entered himself a volun&shy;
<lb />teer in the army.</p>
<p><lb />How soon he grew tired of this change has already
<lb />been related, as well as his reconciliation with his
<lb />father, and his becoming a student at the Temple:  for
<lb />the father now grew as weary of opposing as the
<lb />young man of being opposed.</p>
<p><lb />Here, for two or three years, he lived in happiness
<lb />uninterrupted:  he extended his acquaintance among
<lb />the great, by whom he was no sooner known than ca&shy;
<lb />ressed and admired, and he frequently visited his
<lb />family, which, though he blushed to own in public, he
<lb />affectionately loved in private.  His profession, in&shy;
<lb />deed, was but little in his thoughts, successive engage&shy;
<lb />ments occupying almost all his hours.  Delighted with
<lb />the favour of the world, and charmed to find his pre&shy;
<lb />sence seemed the signal for entertainment, he soon
<lb />forgot the uncertainty of his fortune, and the infe&shy;
<lb />riority of his rank:  the law grew more and more fati&shy;
<lb />guing, pleasure became more and more alluring, and,
<lb />by degrees, he had not a day unappropriated to some
<lb />party or amusement:  voluntarily consigning the few
<lb />leisure moments his gay circle afforded him, to the in&shy;
<lb />dulgence of his fancy in some hasty compositions in
<lb />verse, which were handed about in manuscript, and
<lb />which contributed to keep him in fashion.</p>
<p><lb />Such was his situation at the death of his father; a
<pb n="287" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">283</mw>
<lb />new scene was then opened to him, and for some time
<lb />he hesitated what course to pursue.</p>
<p><lb />Old <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, though he lived in great affluence
<lb />left not behind him any considerable fortune, after
<lb />the portions of his daughters, to each of whom he be&shy;
<lb />queathed 2000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. had been deducted from it.  But his
<lb />stock in trade was great, and his business was prospe&shy;
<lb />rous and lucrative.</p>
<p><lb />His son, however, did not merely want application
<lb />and fortitude to become his successor, but skill and
<lb />knowledge; his deliberation, therefore, was hasty,
<lb />and his resolution improvident; he determined to
<lb />continue at the Temple himself, while the shop, which
<lb />he could by no means afford to relinquish, should be
<lb />kept up by another name, and the business of it be
<lb />transacted by an agent; hoping thus to secure and
<lb />enjoy its emoluments, without either the trouble or
<lb />the humiliation of attendance.</p>
<p><lb />But this scheme, like most others that have their
<lb />basis in vanity, ended in nothing but mortification and
	  <lb />disappointment:  the shop which under old <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName> had been flourishing and successful, and enriched
<lb />himself and all his family, could now scarce support
<lb />the expences of an individual.  Without a master,
<lb />without that diligent attention to its prosperity which
<lb />the interest of possession alone can give, and the au&shy;
<lb />thority of a principal alone can enforce, it quickly lost
<lb />its fame for the excellence of its goods, and soon after
<lb />its customers from the report of its declension.  The
<lb />produce, therefore, diminished every month; he was
<lb />surprised, he was provoked; he was convinced he
<lb />was cheated, and that his affairs were neglected; but
<lb />though he threatened from time to time to enquire
<pb n="288" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">284</mw>
<lb />into the real state of the business, and investigate the
<lb />cause of its decay, he felt himself inadequate to the
<lb />task; and now first lamented that early contempt of
<lb />trade, which by preventing his acquiring some know&shy;
<lb />ledge of it while he had youth and opportunity, made
<lb />him now ignorant what redress to seek; though cer&shy;
<lb />tain of imposition and injury.</p>
<p><lb />But yet, however disturbed by alarming suggestions
<lb />in his hours of retirement, no alteration was made in
<lb />the general course of his life; he was still the darling
<lb />of his friends, and the leader in all parties, and still,
<lb />though his income was lessened, his expences in&shy;
<lb />creased.</p>
<p><lb />Such were his circumstances at the time <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />first saw him at the house of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>:  from
<lb />which, two days after her arrival in town, he was him&shy;
<lb />self summoned, by an information that his agent had
<lb />suddenly left the kingdom.</p>
<p><lb />The fatal consequence of this fraudulent elopement
<lb />was immediate bankruptcy.</p>
<p><lb />His spirits, however, did not yet fail him; as he
<lb />had never been the nominal master of the shop, he es&shy;
<lb />caped all dishonour from its ruin, and was satisfied to
<lb />consign what remained to the mercy of the creditors,
<lb />so that his own name should not appear in the Ga&shy;
<lb />zette.</p>
<p><lb />Three of his sisters were already extremely well
<lb />married to reputable tradesmen; the two elder of
<lb />those who were yet single were settled with two of
	  <lb />those who were married, and <persName>Henrietta</persName>, the youngest,
<lb />resided with her mother, who had a comfortable an&shy;
	  <lb />nuity and a small house at <placeName>Paddington</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />Bereft thus through vanity and imprudence of all
<pb n="289" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">285</mw>
<lb />the long labours of his father, he was now compelled
<lb />to think seriously of some actual method of mainte&shy;
<lb />nance; since his mother, though willing to sacrifice
<lb />to him even the nourishment which sustained her,
<lb />could do for him but little, and that little he had too
<lb />much justice to<sic corr="">o</sic> accept.  The law, even to the most
<lb />diligent and successful, is extremely slow of profit,
<lb />and whatever, from his connections and abilities might
<lb />be hoped hereafter, at present required an expence
<lb />which he was no longer able to support.</p>
<p><lb />It remained then to try his influence with his friends
<lb />among the great and the powerful.</p>
<p><lb />His canvass proved extremely honourable; every
<lb />one promised something, and all seemed delighted to
<lb />have an opportunity of serving him.</p>
<p><lb />Pleased with finding the world so much better than
<lb />report had made it, he now saw the conclusion of his
<lb />difficulties in the prospect of a place at court.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, with half the penetration with which he
<lb />was gifted, would have seen in any other man the
<lb />delusive idleness of expectations no better founded;
<lb />but though discernment teaches us the folly of others,
<lb />experience singly can teach us our own! he flattered
<lb />himself that his friends had been more wisely selected
<lb />than the friends of those who in similar circumstances
<lb />had been beguiled; and he suspected not the fraud of
<lb />his vanity, till he found his invitations daily slacken,
<lb />and that his time was at his own command.</p>
<p><lb />All his hopes now rested upon one friend and pa&shy;
	  <lb />tron, <persName>Mr. Floyer</persName>, and uncle of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, a
<lb />man of power in the royal household, with whom he
<lb />had lived in great intimacy, and who at this period
<lb />had the disposal of a place which he solicited.  The
<pb n="290" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">286</mw>
	  <lb />only obstacle which seemed in his way was from <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName> himself, who warmly exerted his interest in
	  <lb />favour of a friend of his own.  <persName>Mr. Floyer</persName>, however,
<lb />assured Belfield of the preference, and only begged
<lb />his patience till he could find some opportunity of ap&shy;
<lb />peasing his nephew.</p>
<p><lb />And this was the state of his affairs at the time of
<lb />his quarrel at the Opera-house.  Already declared op&shy;
	  <lb />ponents of each other, <persName>Sir Robert</persName> felt double wrath
<lb />that for <emph>him</emph> <persName>Cecilia</persName> should reject his civilities; while
<lb />Belfield, suspecting he presumed upon his known de&shy;
<lb />pendence on his uncle to affront him, felt also double
<lb />indignation at the haughtiness of his behaviour.  And
<lb />thus, slight as seemed to the world the cause of their
<lb />contest, each had private motives of animosity that
<lb />served to stimulate revenge.</p>
<p>	  <lb />The very day after this duel, <persName>Mr. Floyer</persName> wrote him
<lb />word that he was now obliged in common decency to
<lb />take the part of his nephew, and therefore had already
<lb />given the place to the friend he had recommended.</p>
<p><lb />This was the termination of his hopes, and the sig&shy;
<lb />nal of his ruin!  To the pain of his wound he became
<lb />insensible, from the superior pain of this unexpected
<lb />miscarriage; yet his pride still enabled him to dis&shy;
<lb />guise his distress, and to see all the friends whom this
<lb />accident induced to seek him, while from the spright&shy;
<lb />liness he forced in order to conceal his anguish, he
<lb />appeared to them more lively and more entertaining
<lb />than ever.</p>
<p><lb />But these efforts, when left to himself and to nature,
<lb />only sunk him the deeper in sadness; he found an
<lb />immediate change in his way of life was necessary,
<pb n="291" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">287</mw>
<lb />yet could not brook to make it in sight of those with
<lb />whom he had so long lived in all the brilliancy of
<lb />equality.  A high principle of honour which still, in
<lb />the midst of his gay career, had remained uncorrupted,
<lb />had scrupulously guarded him from running into debt,
<lb />and therefore, though of little possessed, that little
<lb />was strictly his own.  He now published that he was
<lb />going out of town for the benefit of purer air, dis&shy;
<lb />charged his surgeon, took a gay leave of his friends,
<lb />and trusting no one with his secret but his servant,
<lb />was privately conveyed to mean and cheap lodgings
	  <lb />in <placeName>Swallow-street</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />Here, shut up from every human being he had for&shy;
<lb />merly known, he puposed to remain till he grew bet&shy;
<lb />ter, and then again to seek his fortune in the army.</p>
<p><lb />His present situation, however, was little calculated
<lb />to contribute to his recovery; the dismission of the
<lb />surgeon, the precipitation of his removal, the inconve&shy;
<lb />niences of his lodgings, and the unseasonable depriva&shy;
<lb />tion of long customary indulgencies, were unavoidable
<lb />delays of his amendment; while the mortification of
<lb />the present disgrace, and the bitterness of his late
<lb />disappointment, preyed incessantly upon his mind,
<lb />robbed him of rest, heightened his fever, and reduced
<lb />him by degrees to a state so low and dangerous, that
<lb />his servant, alarmed for his life, secretly acquainted
<lb />his mother with his illness and retreat.</p>
<p><lb />The mother, almost distracted by this intelligence,
<lb />instantly, with her daughter, flew to his lodgings.  She
<lb />wished to have taken him immediately to her house at
<lb />Paddington, but he suffered so much from his first re&shy;
<lb />moval, that he would not consent to another.  She
<lb />would then have called in a physician, but he refused
<pb n="292" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2N4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">288</mw>
<lb />even to see one; and she had too long given way to
<lb />all his desires and opinions, to have now the force of
<lb />mind for exerting the requisite authority of issuing
<lb />her orders without consulting him.</p>
<p>	  <lb />She begged, she pleaded, indeed, and <persName>Henrietta</persName>
<lb />joined in her entreaties; but sickness and vexatio<sic corr="n">m</sic>
<lb />had not rendered him tame, though they had made
<lb />him sullen:  he resisted their prayers, and commonly
<lb />silenced them by assurances that their opposition to
<lb />the plan he had determined to pursue, only inflamed
<lb />his fever, and retarded his recovery.</p>
<p><lb />The motive of an obduracy so cruel to his friends
<lb />was the fear of a detection which he thought not
<lb />merely prejudicial to his affairs, but dishonourable to
<lb />his character:  for, without betraying any symptom of
<lb />his distress, he had taken a general leave of his ac&shy;
<lb />quaintance, upon pretence of going out of town, and
<lb />he could ill endure to make a discovery which would
<lb />at once proclaim his degradation and his deceit.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Albany</persName> had accidentally broken in upon him,
<lb />by mistaking his room for that of another sick person
<lb />in the same house, to whom his visit had been in&shy;
<lb />tended; but as he knew and reverenced that old gen&shy;
<lb />tleman, he did not much repine at his intrusion.</p>
<p><lb />He was not so easy when the same discovery was
<lb />made by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, who chancing to meet his ser&shy;
<lb />vant in the street, enquired concerning his master's
<lb />health, and surmising from him its real state, followed
<lb />him home; where, soon certain of the change of his
<lb />habitation, he wrote him a letter, in which, after apo&shy;
<lb />logizing for his freedom, he warmly declared that no&shy;
<lb />thing could make him so happy as being favoured with
<lb />his commands, if, either through himself or his friends,
<lb />he could be so fortunate as to do him any service.</p>
<pb n="293" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2O1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">289</mw>
<p>
	  <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, deeply mortified at this detection of his
<lb />situation, returned only a verbal answer of cold thanks,
<lb />and desired he would not speak of his being in town,
<lb />as he was not well enough to be seen.</p>
<p><lb />This reply gave almost equal mortification to young
	  <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, who continued, however, to call at the door
<lb />with enquiries how he went on, though he made no
<lb />further attempt to see him.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, softened at length by the kindness of this
<lb />conduct, determined to admit him; and he was just
<lb />come from paying his first visit, when he was met by
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> upon the stairs.</p>
<p><lb />His stay with him had been short, and he had taken
<lb />no notice either of his change or abode, or his pretence
<lb />of going into the country; he had talked to him only
<lb />in general terms and upon general subjects, till he
<lb />arose to depart, and then he re-urged his offers of
	  <lb />service with so much openness and warmth, that <persName>Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName>, affected by his earnestness, promised he would
<lb />soon see him again, and intimated to his delighted
<lb />mother and sister, that he would frankly consult with
<lb />him upon his affairs.</p>
<p><lb />Such was the tale which, with various minuter cir&shy;
	  <lb />cumstances, <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> communicated to <persName>Cecilia</persName>.
<lb /><q>My mother,</q> she added, <q>who never quits him,
<lb />knows that you are here, madam, for she heard me
<lb />tell her all that had passed, and that you said you
<lb />would come again this morning.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> returned many acknowledgments for this
<lb />artless and unreserved communication, but could not,
<lb />when it was over, forbear enquiring by what early mi&shy;

<lb />sery she had already, though so very young, spent
<lb /><emph>two years in nothing but unhappiness?</emph></p>
<p><lb /><q>Because,</q> she answered, <q>when my poor father
<lb />died all our family separated, and I left every body
	    <lb />to go and live with my mother at <placeName>Paddington</placeName>; and I
<lb />was never a favourite with my mother,&mdash;no more, in&shy;
<lb />deed, was any body but my brother, for she thinks all
<lb />the rest of the world only made for his sake.  So she
<lb />used to deny both herself and me almost common ne&shy;
<lb />cessaries, in order to save up money to make him pre&shy;
<lb />sents:  though, if he had known how it was done, he
<lb />would only have been angry instead of taking them.
<lb />However, I should have regarded nothing that had
<lb />but been for his benefit, for I loved him a great deal
<lb />more than my own convenience; but sums that would
<lb />distress us for months to save up, would by him be
<lb />spent in a day, and then thought of no more!  Nor
<lb />was that all&mdash;&mdash;O no!  I had much greater uneasiness
<lb />to suffer; for I was informed by one of my brother's&shy;
<lb />in-law how ill every thing went, and that certain ruin
<lb />would come to my poor brother from the treachery of
<lb />his agent; and the thought of this was always preying
<lb />upon my mind, for I did not dare tell it my mother,
<lb />for it should put her out of humour, for, some&shy;
<lb />times, she is not very patient; and it mattered little
<lb />what any of us said to my brother, for he was too gay
<lb />and too confident to believe his danger.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, but,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I hope, now, all will
<lb />go better; if your brother will consent to see a phy&shy;
<lb />sician&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah, madam! that is the thing I fear he never
<lb />will do, because of being seen in these bad lodgings.

<lb />I would kneel whole days to prevail with him, but he
<lb />is unused to controul, and knows not how to submit to
<lb />it; and he has lived so long among the great, that he
<lb />forgets he was not born as high as themselves.  Oh
<lb />that he had never quitted his own family!  If he had
<lb />not been spoilt by ambition, he had the best heart and
<lb />sweetest disposition in the world.  But living always
<lb />with his superiors, taught him to disdain his own rela&shy;
<lb />tions, and be ashamed of us all; and yet now, in the
<lb />hour of his distress&mdash;&mdash;who else comes to help him?</q></p>
<p><lb rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)" /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then enquired if she wanted not assistance
<lb />for herself and her mother, observing that they did
<lb />not seem to have all the conveniencies to which they
<lb />were entitled.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="YW23">Why indeed, madam,</q> she replied, with an inge&shy;
<lb />nuous smile, <q id="YW24">when you first came here I was a little
<lb />like my brother, for I was sadly ashamed to let you
<lb />see how ill we lived! but now you know the worst,
<lb />so I shalll fret about it no more.</q>
<lb /><q>But this cannot be your usual way of life; I
<lb />fear the misfortunes of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> have spread a
<lb />ruin wider than his own.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No indeed; he took care from the first not to in&shy;
<lb />volve us in his hazards, for he is very generous,
<lb />madam, and very noble in all his notions, and could
<lb />behave to us all no better about money matters than
<lb />he has ever done.  But from the moment we came to
<lb />this dismal place, and saw his distress, and that <emph>he</emph> was
<lb />sunk so low who used always to be higher than any of
<lb />us, we had a sad scene indeed!  My poor mother, whose
<lb />whole delight was to think that he lived like a noble&shy;
<lb />man, and who always flattered herself that he would
<lb />rise to be as great as the company he kept, was so dis&shy;

<lb />tracted with her disappointment, that she would not
<lb />listen to reason, but immediately discharged both our
<lb />servants, said she and I should do all the work our&shy;
<lb />selves, hired this poor room for us to live in, and sent
<lb />to order a bill to be put upon her house at Paddington,
<lb />for she said she would never return to it any more.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE147">But are you then,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE148">without any
<lb />servant?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>We have my brother's man, madam, and so he
<lb />lights our fires, and takes away some of our litters;
<lb />and there is not much else to be done, except sweeping
<lb />the rooms, for we eat nothing but cold meat from the
<lb />cook shops.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And how long is this to last?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed I cannot tell; for the real truth is, my
<lb />poor mother has almost lost her senses; and ever
<lb />since our coming here, she has been so miserable and
<lb />so complaining, that indeed, between her and my bro&shy;
<lb />ther, I have almost lost mine too!  For when she
<lb />found all her hopes at an end, and that her darling
<lb />son, instead of being rich and powerful, and sur&shy;
<lb />rounded by friends and admirers, all trying who should
<lb />do most for him, was shut up by himself in such a
<lb />little lodging, and instead of gaining wealth, had spent
<lb />all he was worth at first, without a creature to come
<lb />near him, though ill, though confined, though keeping
<lb />his bed!&mdash;Oh madam, had you seen my poor mother
<lb />when she first cast her eyes upon him in that condi&shy;
<lb />tion!&mdash;indeed you could never have forgotten it!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE149">I wonder not at her disappointment,</q> cried Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, <q id="CE150">with expectations so sanguine, and a son of
<lb />so much merit, it might well indeed be bitter.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, and besides the disappointment, she is now
<pb n="297" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2O3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">293</mw>
<lb />continually reproaching herself for always complying
<lb />with his humours, and assisting him to appear better
<lb />than the rest of his family, though my father never
<lb />approved her doing so.  But she thought herself so
<lb />sure of his rising, that she believed we should all
<lb />thank her for it in the end.  And she always used to
<lb />say that he was born to be a gentleman, and what a
<lb />grievous thing it would be to have him made a trades&shy;
<lb />man.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope, at least, she has not the additional misery
<lb />of seeing him ungrateful for her fondness, however in&shy;
<lb />judicious it may have been?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no! he does nothing but comfort and cheer
<lb />her! and indeed it is very good of him, for he has
<lb />owned to me in private, that but for her encourage&shy;
<lb />ment, he could not have run the course he has run,
<lb />for he should have been obliged to enter into business,
<lb />whether he had liked it or not.  But my poor mother
<lb />knows this, though he will not tell it her, and there&shy;
<lb />fore she says that unless he gets well she will punish
<lb />herself all the rest of her life, and never go back to
<lb />her house, and never hire another servant, and never
<lb />eat any thing but bread, nor drink any thing but
<lb />water!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE151">Poor unhappy woman!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE152">how
<lb />dearly does she pay for her imprudent and short&shy;
<lb />sighted indulgence! but surely you are not also to
<lb />suffer in the same manner?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, madam, not by her fault, for she wants me
<lb />to go and live with one of my sisters:  but I would
<lb />not quit her for the world; I should think myself
<lb />wicked indeed to leave her now.  Besides, I don't at

<lb />sent, because my poor brother is in so much distress,
<lb />that all we save may be really turned to account; but
<lb />when we lived so hardly only to procure him luxuries
<lb />he had no right to, I must own I used often to think it
<lb />unfair, and if I had not loved him dearly, I should
<lb />not have borne it so well, perhaps, as I ought.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now began to think it high time to release
<lb />her new acquaintance by quitting her, though she felt
<lb />herself so much interested in her affairs, that every
<lb />word she spoke gave her a desire to lengthen the con&shy;
<lb />versation.  She ardently wished to make her some
<lb />present, but was restrained by the fear of offending,
<lb />or of being again refused; she had, however, devised
<lb />a private scheme for serving her more effectually than
<lb />by the donation of a few guineas, and therefore, after
<lb />earnestly begging to hear from her if she could pos&shy;
<lb />sibly be of any use, she told her that she should not
<lb />find her confidence misplaced, and promising again to
<lb />see her soon, reluctantly departed.</p></div>

<p>
	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> scheme now projected by <persName>Cecilia</persName>, was to ac&shy;
	  <lb />quaint the surgeon who already attended <persName>Mr.

<pb n="299" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2O4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">295</mw>
<lb />desire him to continue his visits, for the payment of
<lb />which she would herself be accountable.</p>
<p><lb />The raillery of young <persName>Delvile</persName>, however, had taught
<lb />her to fear the constructions of the world, and she
	  <lb />therefore purposed to keep both the surgeon and <persName>Mr.
<lb />Belfield</persName> ignorant to whom they were indebted.  She
<lb />was aware, indeed, that whatever might be her ma&shy;
<lb />nagement, that high-spirited and unfortunate young
<lb />man would be extremely hurt to find himself thus de&shy;
<lb />tected and pursued; but she thought his life too well
<lb />worth preserving to let it be sacrificed to his pride,
<lb />and her internal conviction of being herself the imme&shy;
<lb />diate cause of its present danger, gave her an anxious
<lb />and restless desire to be herself the means of extri&shy;
<lb />cating him from it.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Rupil</persName>, was the name of the surgeon, she had al&shy;
<lb />ready heard mentioned by <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and in getting
	  <lb />her chair, she ordered <persName>Ralph</persName>, her man, to enquire
<lb />where he lived.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="RA1">I know already where he lies, madam,</q> answered
	  <lb /><persName>Ralph</persName>, <q id="RA2">for I saw his name over a door in <placeName>Caven&shy;
	      <lb />dish-street</placeName>, <placeName>Oxford-road</placeName>; I took particular notice
<lb />of it, because it was the house where you stood up
<lb />that day on account of the mob that was waiting to
	    <lb />see the malefactors go to <placeName>Tyburn</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb />This answer unravelled to <persName>Cecilia</persName> a mystery which
<lb />had long perplext her; for the speeches of young
<lb />Delvile when he had surprised her in that situation
<lb />were now fully explained.  In seeing her come out
<lb />of the surgeon's house, he had naturally concluded
	  <lb />she had only entered it to ask news of his patient, <persName>Mr.
<lb />Belfield</persName>; her protestations of merely standing up
<lb />to avoid the crowd, he had only laughed at; and his
<pb n="300" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2O4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">296</mw>
<lb />hints at her reserve and dissimulation, were meant
<lb />but to reproach her for refusing his offer of procuring
<lb />her intelligence, at the very time when, to all ap&shy;
<lb />pearance, she anxiously, though clandestinely, sought
<lb />it for herself.</p>
<p><lb />This discovery, notwithstanding it relieved her
<lb />from all suspence of his meaning, gave her much
<lb />vexation:  to be supposed to take an interest so
<lb />ardent, yet so private, in the affairs of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<lb />might well authorise all suspicions of her partiality
<lb />for him:  and even if any doubt had yet remained, the
<lb />unlucky meeting upon the stairs at his lodgings,
<lb />would not fail to dispel it, and confirm the notion of
<lb />her secret regard.  She hoped, however, to have
<lb />soon some opportunity of clearing up the mistake,
<lb />and resolved in the mean time to be studiously
<lb />cautious in avoiding all appearances that might
<lb />strengthen it.</p>
<p><lb />No caution, however, and no apprehension, could
<lb />intimidate her active humanity from putting into im&shy;
<lb />mediate execution a plan in which she feared any
<lb />delay might be fatal; and therefore the moment she
<lb />got home, she wrote the following note to the sur&shy;
<lb />geon.</p>

		  <lb />A <mcr rend="case(allcaps)">friend</mcr> of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> begs

<lb />think proper to mention, for the performance of this
<lb />engagement.</p></div></body></text></q>
<p>
<lb />Her next difficulty was in what manner to have
<lb />this note conveyed; to send her own servant was evi&shy;
<lb />dently betraying herself, to employ any other was
<lb />risking a confidence that might be still more danger&shy;
<lb />ous, and she could not trust to the penny-post, as
<lb />her proposal required an answer.  After much deli&shy;
<lb />beration, she at length determined to have recourse to
	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, to whose services she was entitled, and
<lb />upon whose fidelity she could rely.</p>
<p><lb />The morning was already far advanced, but the
	  <lb /><name>Harrels</name> dined late, and she would not lose a day where
<lb />even an hour might be of importance.  She went
	  <lb />therefore immediately to <persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, whom she found
	  <lb />already removed into her new habitation in <placeName>Fetter-lane</placeName>,
<lb />and equally busy and happy in the change of scene and
<lb />of employment.  She gave to her a note, which she
	  <lb />desired her to carry to <placeName>Cavendish-street</placeName> directly, and
	  <lb />either to deliver it to <persName>Mr. Rupil's</persName> own hands, or to
<lb />bring it back if he was out; but upon no considera&shy;
<lb />tion to make known whence or from whom it came.</p>
<p><lb />She then went into the back part of the shop, which
	  <lb />by <persName>Mrs. Roberts</persName> was called the parlour, and amused
<lb />herself during the absence of her messenger, by play&shy;
<lb />ing with the children.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> at her return said she had found <persName>Mr.
<lb />Rupil</persName> at home, and as she refused to give the letter

<lb />to the servant, she had been taken into a room where
<lb />he was talking with a gentleman, to whom, as soon
<lb />as he had read it, he said with a laugh, <q>Why here's
<lb />another person with the same proposal as yours!
<lb />however, I shall treat you both alike.</q>  And then
<lb />he wrote an answer, which he sealed up, and bid her
<lb />take care of.  This answer was as follows:</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-03"><body>
<div type="letter" rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post(&amp;rdquo;)">
		<p><persName>Mr. Rupil</persName> will certainly attend <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<lb />whose friends may be satisfied he will do all in his
<lb />power to recover him, without receiving any recom&shy;
<lb />pence but the pleasure of serving a gentleman who is
<lb />so much beloved.</p></div></body></text></q>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, charmed at this unhoped for success, was
<lb />making further enquiries into what had passed, when
	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName>, in a low voice, said, <q>There's the gen&shy;
	    <lb />tleman, madam, who was with <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName> when I
<lb />gave him the letter.  I had a notion he was dodging
<lb />me all the way I came, for I saw him just behind me,
<lb />turn which way I would.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then looked&mdash;and perceived young <persName>Delvile</persName>!
<lb />who, after stopping a moment at the door, came into
<lb />the shop, and desired to be shewn some gloves, which,
<lb />among other things, were laid in the window.</p>
<p><lb />Extremely disconcerted at the sight of him, she be&shy;
<lb />gan now almost to fancy there was some fatality
<lb />attending her acquaintance with him, since she was
<lb />always sure of meeting him, when she had any reason
<lb />to wish avoiding him.</p>
<p><lb />As soon as he saw he was observed by her, he
<lb />bowed with the utmost respect:  she coloured in re&shy;
<lb />turning the salutation, and prepared, with no little
<lb />vexation, for another attack, and further raillery,
<lb />similar to what she had already received from him:
<pb n="303" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2P2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">299</mw>
<lb />but, as soon as he had made his purchase, he bowed
<lb />to her again, and, without speaking, left the shop.</p>
<p><lb />A silence so unexpected at once astonished and dis&shy;
<lb />turbed her; she again desired to hear all that had
	  <lb />passed at <persName>Mr. Rupil's</persName>, and from the relation gathered
	  <lb />that <persName>Delvile</persName> had himself undertaken to be responsi&shy;
<lb />ble for his attendance upon <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />A liberality so like her own failed not to impress
<lb />her with the most lively esteem:  but this served ra&shy;
<lb />ther to augment than lessen the pain with which she
<lb />considered the clandestine appearance she thus re&shy;
<lb />peatedly made to him.  She had no doubt he had
<lb />immediately concluded she was the author of the applica&shy;
<lb />tion to the surgeon, and that he followed her mes&shy;
<lb />senger merely to ascertain the fact; while his silence
<lb />when he had made the discovery, she could only
	  <lb />attribute to his now believing that her regard for <persName>Mr.
<lb />Belfield</persName> was too serious for raillery.</p>
<p><lb />Doubly, however, she rejoiced at the generosity
	  <lb />of <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName>, as it rendered wholly unnecessary her
<lb />further interference:  for she now saw with some
<lb />alarm the danger to which benevolence iteslf, directed
<lb />towards a youthful object, might expose her.</p></div>

<lb />sence, excited much curiosity in <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, which
<lb />a quick succession of questions evasively answered
<lb />soon made general; and <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, turning
<lb />to her with a look of surprise, said, <q>If you have such
<lb />freaks as these, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I must begin to
<lb />enquire a little more into your proceedings.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE153">That, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, very coldly, <q id="CE154">would

<lb /><q id="HA30">we shall be able to keep a better watch over her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="FL1">I hope so,</q> answered Sir Robert; <q id="FL2">though,

<lb />she did any thing but read sermons.  However, I
<lb />find there's no going upon trust with women, any
<lb />more than with money.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="HR6">Ay, <persName>Sir Robert</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q id="HR7">you know
<lb />I always advised you not to be quite so easy, and I

<lb />for not being more afraid.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="FL3">Afraid of what, madam?</q> cried the baronet;
<lb /><q id="FL4">of a young lady's walking out without me?  Do you
<lb />think I wish to be any restraint upon <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>'s
<lb />time in the morning, while I have the happiness of
<lb />waiting upon her every afternoon?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was thunderstruck by this speech, which
<lb />not only expressed an open avowal of his pretensions,
<lb />but a confident security of his success.  She was
<lb />shocked that a man of such principles should even
<lb />for a moment presume upon her favour, and irritated
<lb />at the stubbornness of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> in not acquainting
<lb />him with her refusal.</p>
<p><lb />His intimation of coming to the house for <emph>the hap&shy;
<lb />piness of waiting upon her</emph>, made her determine,
<pb n="305" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2P3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">301</mw>
<lb />without losing a moment to seek herself an explana&shy;
<lb />tion with him:  while the discovery that he was in&shy;
<lb />cluded in the Easter party, which various other con&shy;
<lb />comitant causes had already rendered disagreeable to
<lb />her, made her look forward to that proposed expe&shy;
<lb />dition with nothing but unwillingness and distaste.</p>
<p><lb />But though her earnestness to conclude this affair
<lb />made her now put herself voluntarily in the way of
	  <lb />the Baronet, she found plans counteracted by <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, who, with an officiousness too obvious to
<lb />pass for chance, constantly stopt the progress of any
<lb />discourse in which he himself did not bear a part.
<lb />A more passionate admirer might not have been so
	  <lb />easily defeated; but <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, too proud for solici&shy;
<lb />tation, and too indolent for assiduity, was very soon
<lb />checked, because very soon wearied.</p>
<p><lb />The whole evening, therefore, to her infinite mor&shy;
<lb />tification, passed away without affording her any
<lb />opportunity of making known to him his mistake.</p>
<p><lb />Her next effort was to remonstrate with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />himself; but this scheme was not more easy of execu&shy;
<lb />tion than the other, since <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, suspecting she
<lb />meant again to dun him for her money, avoided all
<lb /><sic corr="">all</sic> separate conversation with her so skilfully, that
<lb />she could not find a moment to make him hear her.</p>
<p><lb />She then resolved to apply to his lady; but here
<lb />her success was not better.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, dreading
<lb />another lecture upon &oelig;conomy, peevishly answered
<lb />to her request of a conference, that she was not very
<lb />well, and could not talk gravely.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, justly offended with them all, had now no
<lb />resource but in <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, whose counsel for
<pb n="306" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2P3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">302</mw>
<lb />effectually dismissing the baronet, she determined to
<lb />solicit by the first opportunity.</p>
<p><lb />The moment, therefore, that she next saw him,
	  <lb />she acquainted him with the speeches of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
<lb />and the bahaviour of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb />There needed no rhetoric to point out to <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> the danger of suffering such expectations,
<lb />or the impropriety of her present situation:  he was
<lb />struck with both in a manner the most forcible, and
<lb />spared not for warmth of expression to alarm her deli&shy;
<lb />cacy, or add to her displeasure.  But chiefly he was
<lb />exasperated against <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, assuring her there
<lb />could be no doubt but that he had some particular
<lb />interest in so strenuously and artfully supporting the
	  <lb />pretensions of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> endeavoured to
<lb />refute this opinion, which she regarded as proceed&shy;
<lb />ing rather from prejudice than justice; but when she
<lb />mentioned that the baronet was invited to spend the
	  <lb />Easter holidays at <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>, he represented with
<lb />such energy the consequent constructions of the world,
<lb />as well as the unavoidable encouragement such inti&shy;
<lb />macy would imply, that he terrified her into an earnest
<lb />entreaty to suggest to her some way of deliverance.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN13">There is only one,</q> answered he, <q id="MN14">you must
	    <lb />peremptorily refuse to go to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName> yourself.
<lb />If, after what has passed, you are included in the
	    <lb />same party with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, you give a sanction
<lb />yourself to the reports already circulated of your en&shy;
<lb />gagements with him:  and the effect of such a sanc&shy;
<lb />tion will be more serious than you can easily ima&shy;
<lb />gine, since the knowledge that a connection is
<lb />believed in the world, frequently, if not generally,
<lb />leads by imperceptible degrees to its real ratification.</q></p>

<p>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, with the utmost alacrity, promised im&shy;
<lb />plicitly to follow his advice, whatever might be the
<lb />opposition of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.  He quitted her, therefore,
<lb />with unusual satisfaction, happy in his power over
<lb />her mind, and anticipating with secret rapture the
<lb />felicity he had in reserve from visiting her during the
<lb />absence of the family.</p>
<p><lb />As no private interview was necessary for making
<lb />known her intention of giving up the Easter party,
<lb />which was to take place in two days time, she men&shy;
<lb />tioned the next morning her design of spending the
<lb />holidays in town, when <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> sauntered into
<lb />the breakfast room to give some commission to his
<lb />lady.</p>
<p><lb />At first he only laughed at her plan, gaily rallying
<lb />her upon the love of solitude; but when he found it
<lb />was serious, he very warmly opposed it, and called
<lb />upon <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to join in his expostulations.
<lb />That lady complied, but in so faint a manner, that
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> soon saw she did not wish to prevail; and
<lb />with a concern that cost her infinite pain, now finally
<lb />perceived that not only all her former affection was
<lb />subsided into indifference, but that, since she had
<lb />endeavoured to abridge her amusements, she re&shy;
<lb />garded her as a spy, and dreaded her as the censor
<lb />of her conduct.</p>
<p><lb />Mean while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who was present, though
<lb />he interfered not in the debate, waited the event
<lb />with anxiety; naturally hoping her objections arose
	  <lb />from her dislike of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, and secretly resolving
<lb />to be guided himself by her motions.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> at length, tired of the importunities of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, gravely said, that if he desired to hear the
<pb n="308" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2P4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">304</mw>
<lb />reasons which obliged her to refute his request, she
<lb />was ready to communicate them.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, after a little hesitation, accompanied
<lb />her into another room.</p>
<p><lb />She then declared her resolution not to live under
	  <lb />the same roof with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, and very openly ex&shy;
<lb />pressed her vexation and displeasure that he so evi&shy;
<lb />dently persisted in giving that gentleman encourage&shy;
<lb />ment.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA31">My dear <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> answered he, carelessly,
<lb /><q id="HA32">when young ladies will not know their own minds,
<lb />it is necessary some friend should tell them:  you
	    <lb />were certainly very favourable to <persName>Sir Robert</persName> but a
<lb />short time ago, and so, I dare say, you will be
<lb />again, when you have seen more of him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE155">You amaze me, Sir!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>:  <q id="CE156">when
<lb />was I favourable to him?  Has he not always and re&shy;
<lb />gularly been my aversion?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA33">I fancy,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, laughing, <q id="HA34">you
<lb />will not easily persuade him to think so:  your be&shy;
<lb />haviour at the Opera-house, was ill calculated to
<lb />give him that notion.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>My behaviour at the Opera-house, Sir, I have
	    <lb />already explained to you; and if <persName>Sir Robert</persName> himself
<lb />has any doubts, either from that circumstance or from
<lb />any other, pardon me if I say they can only be attri&shy;
<lb />buted to your unwillingness to remove them.  I en&shy;
<lb />treat you, therefore, to trifle with him no longer, nor
<lb />to subject me again to the freedom of implications
<lb />extremely disagreeable to me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O fie, fie, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>! after all that has
<lb />passed, after his long expectations, and his constant
<pb n="309" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)"><sic corr="305">350</sic></mw>
<lb />attendance, you cannot for a moment think seriously
<lb />of discarding him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, equally surprised and provoked by this
<lb />speech, could not for a moment tell how to answer
<lb />it; and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, wilfully misinterpreting her
<lb />silence, took her hand, and said, <q>Come, I am sure
<lb />you have too much honour to make a fool of such a
<lb />man as <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.  There is not a woman in
<lb />town who will not envy your choice, and I assure
	    <lb />you there is not a man in <placeName>England</placeName> I would so soon
<lb />recommend to you.</q></p>
<p><lb />He would then have hurried her back to the
<lb />next room; but, drawing away her hand with
<lb />undisguised resentment, <q id="CE157">No, Sir,</q> she cried, <q id="CE158">this
	    <lb />must not pass! my positive rejection of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
<lb />the instant you communicated to me his proposals,
<lb />you can neither have forgotten nor mistaken:  and
<lb />you must not wonder if I acknowledge myself ex&shy;
<lb />tremely disobliged by your unac<sic corr="c"></sic>ountable
<lb />perseverance
<lb />in refusing to receive my answer.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA35">Young ladies who have been brought up in the
<lb />country,</q> returned <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, with his usual neg&shy;
<lb />ligence, <q id="HA36">are always so high flown in their notions,
<lb />it is difficult to deal with them; but as I am much
<lb />better acquainted with the world than you can be,
<lb />you must give me leave to tell you, that if, after all
<lb />you refuse Sir Robert, it will be using him very ill.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE159">Why will you say so, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE160"> when
<lb />it is utterly impossible you can have formed so pre&shy;
<lb />posterous an opinion.  Pray hear me, however, finally,
	    <lb />and pray tell <persName>Sir Robert</persName>&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre()post(&amp;rdquo;)" id="HA37">No, no,</q> interrupted he, with affected gaiety,

<lb /><q id="HA38">you shall manage it all your own way; I will have
<lb />nothing to do with the quarrels of lovers.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then with a pretended laugh, he hastily left
<lb />her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was so much incensed by this impracticable
<lb />behaviour, that instead of returning to the family,
<lb />she went directly to her own room.  It was easy for
<lb />her to see that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was bent upon using
<lb />every method he could devise, to entangle her to some
	  <lb />engagement with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, and though she could
<lb />not imagine the meaning of such a scheme, the little&shy;
<lb />ness of his behaviour excited her contempt, and the
<lb />long-continued error of the baronet gave her the ut&shy;
<lb />most uneasiness.  She again determined to seek an
<lb />explanation with him herself, and immovably to re&shy;
	  <lb />fuse joining the party to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />The following day, while the ladies and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb />were at breakfast, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> came into the room to
<lb />enquire if they should all be ready to set off for his
<lb />villa by ten o'clock the next day.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> and
<lb />her brother answered in the affirmative; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />was silent, and he turned to her and repeated his
<lb />question.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE161">Do you think me so capricious, Sir,</q> said she,
<lb /><q id="HA39">that after telling you but yesterday I could not be
<lb />of your party, I shall tell you to-day that I can?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA40">Why you do not really mean to remain in town
<lb />by yourself?</q> replied he, <q id="HA41">You cannot suppose that
<lb />will be an eligible plan for a young lady.  On the
<lb />contrary, it will be so very improper, that I think
<lb />myself, as your guardian, obliged to oppose it.</q></p>
<p><lb />Amazed at this authoritative speech, <persName>Cecilia</persName> looked
<lb />at him with a mixture of mortification and anger;
<pb n="311" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">307</mw>
<lb />but knowing it would be vain to resist his power if
<lb />he was resolute to exert it, she made not any answer.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA42">Besides,</q> he continued, <q id="HA43">I have a plan for some
<lb />alterations in the house during my absence; and I
<lb />think your room, in particular, will be much im&shy;
<lb />proved by them; but it will be impossible to employ
<lb />any workmen, if we do not all quit the premises.</q></p>
<p><lb />This determined persecution now seriously alarmed
<lb />her; she saw that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> would omit no ex&shy;
<lb />pedient or stratagem to encourage the adresses of
<lb />Sir Robert, and force her into his presence; and
<lb />she began next to apprehend that her connivance in
<lb />his conduct might be presumed upon by that gentle&shy;
<lb />man:  she resolved, therefore, as the last and only
<lb />effort in her power for avoiding him, to endeavour
	  <lb />to find an accomodation at the house of <persName>Mrs. Del&shy;
	    <lb />vile</persName>, during the excurison to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>:  and if,
	  <lb />when she returned to <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, the Baronet
<lb />still persevered in his attendance, to entreat her
<lb />friend <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> would take upon himself the
<lb />charge of undeceiving him.</p></div>

<p><lb />She found <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> alone, and still at break&shy;

<pb n="312" />

<p>
<lb />After the first compliments were over, while she
<lb />was considering in what manner to introduce her
<lb />proposal, <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> herself led to the subject, by
<lb />saying, <q>I am very sorry to hear we are so soon to
<lb />lose you; but I hope <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> does not intend to
<lb />make any long stay at his villa:  for if he does, I
<lb />shall be half tempted to come and run away with
<lb />you from him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE162">And that,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, delighted with this
<lb />opening, <q id="CE163">would be an honour I am <emph>more</emph> than half
<lb />tempted to desire.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE164">Why indeed your leaving <placeName>London</placeName> just at this
<lb />time,</q> continued <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, <q id="CE165">is for me, parti&shy;
<lb />cularly unfortunate, as, if I could now be favoured
<lb />with your visits, I should doubly value them; for
<lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> is gone to spend the holidays at the
	    <lb />Duke of <placeName>Dervent's</placeName>, whither I was not well enough
<lb />to accompany him:  my son has his own engage&shy;
<lb />ments, and there are so few people I can bear to see,
<lb />that I shall live almost entirely alone.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE166">If I,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE167">in such a situation might
<lb />hope to be admitted, how gladly for that happiness
	    <lb />would I exchange my expedition to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="DL15">You are very good, and very amiable.</q> said <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, <q id="DL16">and your society would indeed give me
<lb />infinite satisfaction.  Yet I am no enemy to solitude;
<lb />on the contrary, company is commonly burthensome
<lb />to me:  I find few who have any power to give me
<lb />entertainment, and even of those few, the chief part
<lb />have in their manners, situation, or characters, an
<lb />unfortunate <emph>something</emph>, that generally renders a near
<lb />connection with them inconvenient or disagreeable.
<lb />There are, indeed, so many draw-backs to regard
<pb n="313" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">309</mw>
<lb />and intimacy, from pride, from propriety, and vari&shy;
<lb />ous other<sic corr="&amp;blank;"></sic>collateral causes, that rarely as we meet with
<lb />people of brilliant parts, there is almost ever some
<lb />objection to our desire of meeting them again.  Yet to
<lb />live wholly alone is cheerless and depressing; and
<lb />with you, at least,</q> taking <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s hand, <q id="DL17">I find
<lb />not one single obstacle to oppose to a thousand in&shy;
<lb />ducements, which invite me to form a friendship
<lb />that I can only hope may be as lasting, as I am sure
<lb />it will be pleasant.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> expressed her sense of this partiality in the
<lb />warmest terms; and <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, soon discovering
<lb />by her manner that she took not any delight in her
	  <lb />intended visit to <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName>, began next to question
<lb />her whether it would be possible for her to give it up.</p>
<p><lb />She instantly answered in the affirmative.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="DL18">And would you really be so obliging,</q> cried <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, with some surprise, <q id="DL19">as to bestow upon me
<lb />the time you had destined for this gay excursion?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE168">Most willingly,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE169">if you are
<lb />so good as to wish it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But can you also&mdash;&mdash;for you must by no means
	    <lb />remain alone in <placeName>Portman Square</placeName>,&mdash; &mdash;manage to live
<lb />entirely in my house till <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s return?</q></p>
<p><lb />To this proposal, which was what she most de&shy;
<lb />sired, <persName>Cecilia</persName> gave a glad assent; and <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />extremely pleased with her compliance, promised to
<lb />have an apartment prepared for her immediately.</p>
<p><lb />She then hastened home, to announce her new
<lb />plan.</p>
<p><lb />This she took occasion to do when the family was
<lb />assembled at dinner.  The surprize with which she
	  <lb />was heard was very general:  <persName>Sir Robert</persName> seemed at
<pb n="314" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">310</mw>
<lb />a loss what conclusion to draw from her information;
<lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was half elated with pleasure, and half
<lb />depressed with apprehension; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> wondered
<lb />without any other sensation; and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> him&shy;
<lb />self was evidently the most concerned of the party.</p>
<p><lb />Every effort of persuasion and importunity he now
<lb />essayed to prevail upon her to give up this scheme,
<lb />and still accompany them to the villa; but she
	  <lb />coolly answered that her engagement with <persName>Mrs. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName> was decided, and she had appointed to wait
<lb />upon her the next morning.</p>
<p><lb />When her resolution was found so steady, a gen&shy;
	  <lb />neral ill-humour took place of surprise:  <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
<lb />now had the air of a man who thought himself
<lb />affronted; <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was wretched from a thousand
<lb />uncertainties; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, indeed, was still the
<lb />most indifferent; but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> could hardly re&shy;
<lb />press his disappointment and anger.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, was all gaiety and pleasure:  in re&shy;
<lb />moving only from the house of one guardian to another,
<lb />she knew she could not be opposed; and the flatter&shy;
<lb />ing readiness with which <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> had anticipated
<lb />her request, without enquiring into her motives, had
<lb />relieved her from a situation which now grew ex&shy;
<lb />tremely distressing, without giving to her the pain of
<lb />making complaints of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.  The absence of
<lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> contributed to her happiness, and she
<lb />much rejoiced in having now the prospect of a speedy
<lb />opportunity to explain to his son, whatever had ap&shy;
	  <lb />peared mysterious in her conduct respecting <persName>Mr. Bel&shy;
<lb />field</persName>.  If she had any thing to regret, it was merely
<lb />the impossibility, at this time of waiting for the
<lb />counsel of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.</p>
<pb n="315" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">311</mw>
<p>
<lb />The next morning, while the family was in the
<lb />midst of preparation for departure, she took leave of
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who faintly lamented the loss of her com&shy;
	  <lb />pany, and then hastily made her compliments to <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and putting herself into a
<lb />chair, was conveyed to her new habitation.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> received her with the most distin&shy;
<lb />guished politeness; she conducted her to the apart&shy;
<lb />ment which had been prepared for her, led her to
<lb />the library, which she desired her to make use of as
<lb />her own, and gave her the most obliging charges to
<lb />remember that she was in a house of which she had
<lb />the command.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Young <persName>Delvile</persName> did not make his appearance till
<lb />dinner time.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, from recollecting the strange
<lb />situations in which she had lately been seen by him,
<lb />blushed extremely when she first met his eyes; but
<lb />finding him gay and easy, general in his conversation,
<lb />and undesigning in his looks, she soon recovered from
<lb />her embarrassment, and passed the rest of the day
<lb />without any restraint or uneasiness.</p>
<p><lb />Every hour she spent with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, contri&shy;
<lb />buted to raise in her esteem the mind and understand&shy;
<lb />ing of that lady.  She found, indeed, that it was
<lb />not for nothing she was accused of pride, but she found
<lb />at the same time so many excellent qualities, so much
<lb />true dignity of mind, and so noble a spirit of libera&shy;
<lb />lity, that however great was the respect she seemed
<lb />to demand, it was always inferior to what she felt
<lb />inclined to pay.</p>
<p><lb />Nor was young <persName>Delvile</persName> less rapid in the progress
<lb />he made in her favour; his character, upon every
<lb />opportunity of shewing it, rose in her opinion, and
<pb n="316" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Q4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">312</mw>
<lb />his disposition and manners had a mingled sweetness
<lb />and vivacity that rendered his society attrctive and
<lb />his conversation spirited.</p>
<p><lb />Here therefore, <persName>Cecilia</persName> experienced that happiness
<lb />she so long had coveted in vain:  her life was neither
<lb />public nor private, her amusements were neither dis&shy;
<lb />sipated nor retired; the company she saw were either
<lb />people of high rank or strong parts, and their visits
<lb />were neither frequent nor long.  The situation she
<lb />quitted gave a zest to that into which she entered,
<lb />for she was now no longer shocked by extravagance
<lb />or levity, no longer tormented with addresses which
<lb />disgusted her, nor mortified by the ingratitude of the
<lb />friend she had endeavoured to serve.  All was smooth
<lb />and serene, yet lively and interesting.</p>
<p><lb />Her plan, however, of clearing to young <persName>Delvile</persName>
	  <lb />his mistakes concerning <persName>Belfield</persName>, she could not put
<lb />in execution; for he now never led to the subject,
<lb />though he was frequently alone with her, nor seemed
<lb />at all desirous to renew his former raillery, or re&shy;
<lb />peat his enquiries.  She wondered at this change in
<lb />him, but chose rather to wait the revival of his own
<lb />curiosity, than to distress or perplex herself by con&shy;
<lb />triving methods of explanation.</p>
<p><lb />Situated thus happily, she had now one only anx&shy;
<lb />iety, which was to know whether, and in what man&shy;
<lb />ner, <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName> had received his surgeon, as well
<lb />as the actual state of his own and his sister's affairs:
<lb />but the fear of again encountering young <persName>Delvile</persName> in
<lb />suspicious circumstances, deterred her at present
<lb />from going to their house.  Yet her natural benevo&shy;
<lb />lence, which partial convenience never lulled to
<lb />sleep, impressing her with an apprehension that her
<pb n="317" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">313</mw>
<lb />services might be wanted, she was induced to write
	  <lb />to <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, though she forbore to visit her.</p>
<p><lb />Her letter was short, but kind, and to the purpose:
<lb />she apologized for her officiousness, desired to know
<lb />if her brother was better, and entreated her in terms
<lb />the most delicate, to acquaint her if yet she would
<lb />accept from her any assistance.</p>
<p><lb />She sent this letter by her servant, who, after
<lb />waiting a considerable time, brought her the follow&shy;
<lb />ing answer:</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-04"><body>

<p>
<lb />Ah madam! your goodness quite melts me! we
<lb />want nothing, however, yet, though I fear we shall
<lb />not say so much longer.  But though I hope I shall
<lb />never forget myself so as to be proud and impertinent,
<lb />I will rather struggle with any hardship than beg,
<lb />for I will not disoblige my poor brother by any
<lb />fault that I can help, especially now he is fallen so
<lb />low.  But, thank heaven, his wound has at last been
<lb />dressed, for the surgeon has found him out, and he
<lb />attends him for nothing; though my brother is will&shy;
<lb />ing to part with every thing he is worth in the world,
<lb />rather than owe that obligation to him:  yet I often
<lb />wonder why he hates so to be obliged, for when he
<lb />was rich himself he was always doing something to
<lb />oblige other people.  But I fear the surgeon thinks
<lb />him very bad! for he wont speak to us when we fol&shy;
<lb />low him down stairs.</p>
<p><lb />I am sadly ashamed to send this bad writing, but I

<lb />would forgive it, I believe, if it was worse, almost.
<lb />And though we are not in need of your kind offers,
<lb />it is a great comfort to me to think there is a lady in
<lb />the world that, if we come to be quite destitute, and

<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, much moved by the simplicity of this letter,
<lb />determined that her very first visit to Portman-square
<lb />should be to its fair and innocent writer.  And
<lb />having now an assurance that she was in no imme&shy;
<lb />diate distress, and that her brother was actually un&shy;
	  <lb />der <persName>Mr. Rupil's</persName> care, she dismissed from her mind
<lb />the only subject of uneasiness that at present had en&shy;
<lb />deavoured to disturb it, and gave herself wholly up
<lb />to the delightful serenity of unallayed happiness.</p>
<p><lb />Few are the days of unmixed felicity which we
<lb />acknowledge while we experience, though many are
<lb />those we deplore, when by sorrow taught their value,
<lb />and by misfortune their loss.  Time with <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />now glided on with such rapidity, that before she
<pb n="319" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">315</mw>
<lb />thought the morning half over, the evening was
<lb />closed, and ere she was sensible the first week was
<lb />passed, the second was departed for ever.  More and
<lb />more pleased with the inmates of her new habita&shy;
<lb />tion, she found the abilities of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> sources
<lb />inexhaustible of entertainment, and in the disposition
<lb />and sentiments of her son something so concordant to
<lb />her own, that almost every word he spoke shewed
<lb />the sympathy of her minds, and almost every look
<lb />which caught her eyes was a reciprocation of intel&shy;
<lb />ligence.  Her heart deeply wounded of late by un&shy;
<lb />expected indifference, and undeserved mortification,
<lb />was now, perhaps, more than usually susceptible of
<lb />those penetrating and exquisite pleasures which
<lb />friendship and kindness possess the highest powers
<lb />of bestowing.  Easy, gay, and airy, she only rose
<lb />to happiness, and only retired to rest; and not
<lb />merely heightened was her present enjoyment by
<lb />her past disappointment, but, carrying her retros&shy;
<lb />pection to her earliest remembrance, she still found
<lb />her actual situation more peculiarly adapted to her
<lb />taste and temper, than she had hitherto at any time
<lb />experienced.</p>
<p><lb />The very morning that the destined fortnight was
<lb />elapsed, she received a note from <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, with
<lb />information of her arrival in town, and an entreaty
	  <lb />that she would return to <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who, thus happy, had forgot to mark the
<lb />progress of time, was now all amazement to find the
<lb />term of her absence so soon past.  She thought of
<lb />going back with the utmost reluctance, and of quit&shy;
<lb />ting her new abode with the most lively regret.  The
<lb />representations of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> daily lost their
<pb n="320" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">316</mw>
<lb />force, and notwithstanding her dislike of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />she had no wish so earnest as that of being settled in
<lb />his family for the rest of her minority.</p>
<p><lb />To effect this was her next thought; yet she knew
<lb />not how to make the proposal:  but from the uncom&shy;
<lb />mon partiality of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, she hoped, with a very
<lb />little encouragement, she would lead to it herself.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Here, however, she was disappointed; <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, when she heard of the summons from the
	  <lb /><name>Harrels</name>, expressed her sorrow at losing her, in terms
<lb />of the most flattering regret, yet seemed to think the
<lb />parting indispensable, and dropt not the most dis&shy;
<lb />tant hint of attempting to prevent it.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, vexed and disconcerted, then made ar&shy;
<lb />rangements for her departure, which she fixed for
<lb />the next morning.</p>
<p><lb />The rest of the day, unlike every other, which for
<lb />the last fortnight had preceded it, was passed with
	  <lb />little appearance, and no reality of satisfaction:  <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName> was evidently concerned, her son openly
<lb />avowed his chagrin, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> felt the utmost mor&shy;
<lb />tification; yet, though every one was discontented,
<lb />no effort was made towards obtaining any delay.</p>
<p><lb />The next morning during breakfast, <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>
<lb />very elegantly thanked her for granting to her so much
<lb />of her time, and earnestly begged to see her in future
<lb />whenever she could be spared from her other friends;
<lb />protesting she was now so accustomed to her
<lb />society, that she should require both long and fre&shy;
<lb />quent visits to soften the separation.  This request
<lb />was very eagerly seconded by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, who
<lb />warmly spoke his satisfaction that his mother had
<lb />found so charming a friend, and unaffectedly joined
<pb n="321" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">317</mw>
<lb />in her entreaties that the intimacy might be still more
<lb />closely cemented.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> had no great difficulty in according her
<lb />compliance to those demands, of which the kindness
<lb />and cordiality somewhat lessened her disturbance at
<lb />the parting.</p>
<p><lb />When <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s carriage arrived, <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>
<lb />took a most affectionate leave of her, and her son
<lb />attended her to the coach.</p>
<p><lb />In her way down stairs, he stopt her for a few mo&shy;
<lb />ments, and in some confusion said, <q>I wish much to
<lb />apologize to <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, before her departure,
<lb />for the very gross mistake of which I have been guilty.
<lb />I know not if it is possible she can pardon me, and I
<lb />hardly know myself by what perversity and blindness
<lb />I persisted so long in my error.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE170">O,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much rejoiced at this voluntary
<lb />explanation, <q id="CE171">if you are but convinced you were
<lb />really in an error, I have nothing more to wish.
<lb />Appearances, indeed, were so strangely against me,
<lb />that I ought not, perhaps, to wonder they deceived
<lb />you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO43">This is being candid indeed,</q> answered he, again
<lb />leading her on:  <q id="MO44">and in truth, though your anxiety
<lb />was obvious, its cause was obscure, and were any
<lb />thing is left to conjecture, opinion interferes, and the
<lb />judgment is easily warped.  My own partiality, how&shy;
<lb />ever, for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, will I hope plead my excuse,
<lb />as from that, and not from any prejudice against the
<lb />Baronet, my mistake arose:  on the contrary, so highly
<lb />I respect your taste and your discernment, that your
<lb />approbation, when known, can scarcely fail of securing
<lb />mine.</q></p>
<pb n="322" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">318</mw>
<p>
<lb />Great as was the astonishment of <persName>Cecilia</persName> at the
<lb />conclusion of this speech; she was at the coach door
<lb />before she could make any answer; but Delvile, per&shy;
<lb />ceiving her surprise, added, while he handed her in,
<lb /><q>Is it possible&mdash; &mdash; &mdash;but no, it is <emph>not</emph> possible I should
<lb />be again mistaken.  I forebore to speak at all,
<lb />till I had information by which I could not be mis&shy;
<lb />led.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE172">I know not in what unaccountable obscurity,</q>
<lb />cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE173">I, or my affairs, may be involved, but
<lb />I perceive that the cloud which I had hoped was
<lb />dissipated, is thicker and more impenetrable that
<lb />ever.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> then bowed to her with a look that accused
<lb />her of insincerity, and the carriage drove away.</p>
<p><lb />Teazed by these eternal mistakes, and provoked to
<lb />find that though the object of her supposed partiality
<lb />was so frequently changed, the notion of her positve
<lb />engagement with one of the duellists was invariable,
<lb />she resolved, with all the speed in her power, to
	  <lb />commission <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> to wait upon <persName>Sir Robert
<lb />Floyer</persName>, and in her own name give a formal rejection
<lb />to his proposals, and desire him thenceforward to make
<lb />known, by every opportunity, their total indepen&shy;
	  <lb />dence of each other:  for sick of debating with <persName>Mr.
	    <lb />Harrel</persName>, and detesting all intercourse with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>,
<lb />she now dropt her design of seeking an explanation
<lb />herself.</p>
<p><lb />She was received by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> with the same
<lb />coldness with which she had parted from her.  That
<lb />lady appeared now to have some uneasiness upon her
<lb />mind, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> endeavoured to draw from her its
<lb />cause; but far from seeking any alleviation in friend&shy;
<pb n="323" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2R4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">319</mw>
<lb />ship, she studiously avoided her, seeming pained by
	  <lb />her conversation, and reproached by her sight.  <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName> perceived this encreasing reserve with much
<lb />concern, but with more indignation, conscious that
<lb />her good offices had merited a better reception, and
<lb />angry to find that her advice had not merely failed of
<lb />success, but even exposed her to aversion.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, on the contrary, behaved to her with
<lb />unusual civility, seemed eager to oblige her, and
<lb />desirous to render his house more agreeable to her
<lb />than ever.  But in this he did not prosper; for <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />immediately upon her return, looking in her apart&shy;
<lb />ment for the projected alterations, and finding none
<lb />had been made, was so disgusted by such a detection
<lb />of duplicity, that he sunk yet lower than before in her
<lb />opinion, and she repined at the necessity she was
<lb />under of any longer continuing his guest.</p>
<p><lb />The joy of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> at again seeing her, was
<lb />visible and sinceree; and not a little was it increased
<lb />by finding that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who sought not more to avoid
	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, than she was herself
<lb />avoided by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, talked with pleasure to no&shy;
<lb />body else in the house, and scarcely attempted to
<lb />conceal that he was the only one of the family who
<lb />possessed any portion of her esteem.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Even <persName>Sir Robert</persName> appeared now to have formed a
<lb />design of paying her rather more respect than he had
<lb />hitherto thought necessary; but the violence he did
<lb />himself was so evident, and his imperious nature
<lb />seemed so repugnant to the task, that his insolence
<lb />breaking forth by starts, and checked only by com&shy;
<lb />pulsion, was but the more conspicuous from his
<lb />inadequate efforts to disguise it.</p></div>

	  <lb />suspicions of harbouring too tender a regard for <persName>Mr.
<lb />Belfield</persName>, her objections to visiting his sister were re&shy;
	  <lb />moved, and the morning after her return to <persName>Mr.
	    <lb />Harrel's</persName> she went in a chair to <placeName>Swallow-street</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />She sent her servant up stairs to enquire if she might
<lb />be admitted, and was immediately taken into the room
<lb />where she had twice before been received.</p>
<p>	  <lb />In a few minutes <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, softly opening and
<lb />shutting the door of the next apartment, made her
<lb />appearance.  She looked thin and pale, but much
<lb />gratified by the sight of <persName>Cecilia</persName>.  <q id="YW25">Ah Madam!</q> she
<lb />cried <q id="YW26">you are good indeed not to forget us! and
<lb />you can little think how it cheers and consoles me,
<lb />that such a lady as you can condescend to be kind to
<lb />me.  It is quite the only pleasure that I have now in

<p><lb /><q id="CE174">I grieve that you have no greater;</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q id="CE175">you seem much fatigued and harrassed.  How is
<lb />your brother?  I fear you neglect your own health,
<lb />by too much attention to his.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, indeed, madam; my mother does every thing
<lb />for him herself, and hardly suffers any body else to go
<lb />near him.</q></p><p>
<lb /><q id="CE176">What, then, makes you so melancholy?</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, taking her hand; <q id="CE177">
you do not look well;

<p>
<lb /><q id="YW27">How should I look well, madam,</q> answered she,
<lb /><q id="YW28">living as I live? however, I will not talk of myself,
<lb />but of my brother.&mdash;O he is so ill! indeed I am
<lb />sadly, sadly afraid he will never be well again!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What does his surgeon say? you are too tender,
<lb />and too much frightened to be any judge.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It is not that I think myself he will die of his
	    <lb />wound, for <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName> says the wound is almost no&shy;
<lb />thing; but he is in a constant fever, and so thin and
<lb />so weak, that indeed it is almost impossible he should
<lb />recover.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE178">You are too apprehensive,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="CE179">you
<lb />know not what effect the country air may have upon
<lb />him; there are many, many expedients that with so
<lb />young a man may yet be successful.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no, the country air can do nothing for him!
<lb />for I will not deceive you, madam, for that would be
<lb />doubly a fault, when I am so ready in blaming other
<lb />people for wearing false appearances:  besides, you
<lb />are so good and so gentle, that it quite composes me
<lb />to talk with you.  So I will honestly speak the truth,
<lb />and the whole truth at once; my poor brother is lost&mdash;
<lb />O I fear for ever lost!&mdash;all by his own unhappy pride!
<lb />he forgets his father was a tradesman, he is ashamed
<lb />of all his family, and his whole desire is to live among
<lb />the grandest people, as if he belonged to no other.
<lb />And now that he can no longer do that, he takes the
<lb />disappointment so to heart, that he cannot get the
<lb />better of it; and he told me this morning that he
<lb />wished he was dead, for he did not know why he
<lb />should live only to see his own ruin!  But when he
<lb />saw how I cried at his saying so, he was very sorry
<lb />indeed, for he has always been the kindest brother in

<lb />the world, when he has been away from the great
<lb />folks who have spoilt him:  but why, said he, Hen&shy;
<lb />rietta, why would you have me live, when instead of
<lb />raising you and my poor mother into a higher station,
<lb />I am sunk so low, that I only help to consume your
<lb />own poor pittances to support me in my disgrace!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE180">I am sorry indeed,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE181">to find he has
<lb />so deep a sense of the failure of his expectations:
<lb />but how happens it that <emph>you</emph> are so much wiser?
<lb />Young and inexperienced as you are, and early as
<lb />you must have been accustomed, from your mother as
<lb />well as from <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, to far other doctrine, the
<lb />clearness of your judgment, and the justness of your
<lb />remarks, astonish as much as they charm me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah madam! brought up as I have been brought
<lb />up, there is little wonder I should see the danger of
<lb />a high education, let me be ever so ignorant of every
<lb />thing else; for I and all my sisters, have been the
<lb />sufferers the whole time:  and while we were kept
<lb />backward that he might be brought forward, while
<lb />we were denied comforts, that he might have luxuries,
<lb />how could we help seeing the evil of so much vanity,
<lb />and wishing we had all been brought up according to
<lb />our proper station? instead of living in continual
<lb />inconvenience, and having one part of a family strug&shy;
<lb />gling with distress, only to let another part of it
<lb />appear in a way he had no right to!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE182">How rationally,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE183">have you consi&shy;
<lb />dered this subject! and how much do I honour you
<lb />for the affeciton you retain for your brother, not with&shy;
<lb />standing the wrongs you have suffered to promote his
<lb />elevation!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed he deserves it; take but from him that
<pb n="327" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2S2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">323</mw>
<lb />one fault pride, and I believe he has not another:
<lb />and humoured and darling child as from his infancy
<lb />he has always been, who at that can wonder, or be
<lb />angry?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And has he still no plan, no scheme for his future
<lb />destination?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, madam, none at all; and that it is makes him
<lb />so miserable, and being so miserable, makes him so
	    <lb />ill, for <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName> says that with such uneasiness upon
<lb />his mind, he can never, in his present low state, get
<lb />well.  O it is melancholy to see how he is altered! and
<lb />how he has lost all his fine spirits! he that used to be
<lb />the life of us all!</q>&mdash;And now he hardly ever speaks a
<lb />word, or if he does, he says something so sorrowful
<lb />that it cuts us to the soul!  But yesterday, when my
<lb />mother and I thought he was asleep, he lifted up his
<lb />head, and looked at us both with the tears in his eyes,
<lb />which almost broke our hearts to see, and then, in a
<lb />low voice, he said, <q id="YM1">what a lingering illness is this!
	    <lb />Ah, my dear mother, you and poor <persName>Henrietta</persName> ought to
<lb />wish it quicker over! for should I recover, my life,
<lb />heareafter, will but linger like this illness.</q>  And
<lb />afterwards he called out, <q id="YM2">what on earth is to become
<lb />of me?  I shall never have health for the army, nor
<lb />interest, nor means; what am I to do? subsist in the
<lb />very prime of my life upon the bounty of a widowed
<lb />mother? or, with such an education, such connections
<lb />as mine, enter at last into some mean and sordid
<lb />business?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE184">It seems then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE185">he now less wants
<lb />a physician than a friend.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>He has a friend, madam, a noble friend, would he

<lb />out suffering fresh vexation, nad his fever encreases
<lb />after every visit he pays him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE186">Well,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, rising, <q id="CE187">I find we shall not
<lb />have an easy task to manage him; but keep up your
<lb />spirits, and assure yourself he shall not be lost, if it
<lb />be possible to save him.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then, though with much fearfulness of offending,
	  <lb />once more made an offer of her purse.  <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>
<lb />no longer started at the proposal; yet gratefully
<lb />thanking her, said she was not in any immediate
<lb />distress, and did not dare risk the displeasure of her
<lb />brother, unless driven to it by severe necessity.  Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, however, drew from her a promise that she
<lb />would apply to her in any sudden difficulty, and
<lb />charged her never to think herself without a banker
<lb />wihile her direction was known to her.</p>
<p><lb />She then bid her adieu, and returned home; medi&shy;
<lb />tating the whole way upon some plan of employment
<lb />and advantage for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, which by clearing his
<lb />prospects, might revive his spirits, and facilitate his
<lb />recovery:  for since his mind was so evidently the seat
<lb />of his disease, she saw that unless she could do more
<lb />for him, she had yet done nothing.</p>
<p><lb />Her meditation, however, turned to no account; she
<lb />could suggest nothing, for she was ignorant what
<lb />was eligible to suggest.  The stations and employ&shy;
<lb />ments of men she only knew by occasionally hearing
<lb />that such were their professions, and such their
<lb />situations in life; but with the means and gradations
<lb />by which they arose to them she was wholly unac&shy;
<lb />quainted.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, her constant resource in all cases
<lb />of difficulty, immediately occured to her as her most
<pb n="329" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2S3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">325</mw>
<lb />able counsellor, and she determined by the first
<lb />opportunity to consult with him upon the subject,
<lb />certain of advice the most judicious from his expe&shy;
<lb />rience and knowledge of the world.</p>
<p><lb />But though she rested upon him her serious expec&shy;
<lb />tations of assistance, another idea entered her mind
<lb />not less pleasant, though less promising of utility:
<lb />this was to mention her views to young <persName>Delvile</persName>.  He
<lb />was already, she knew, well informed of the distress
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, and she hoped, by openly asking his
<lb />opinion, to confirm to him her freedom from any
<lb />engagement with that gentleman, and convince him,
<lb />at the same time, by her application to himself,
<lb />that she was equally clear of any tie with the Ba&shy;
<lb />ronet.</p></div>

<p><lb />This accordingly happened; for in the evening
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> quitted the room for a few moments to

<p><lb /><q>You are acquainted, I believe, with the distress of

<lb />than an opportunity of serving him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE188">He is, indeed, much to be compassionated,</q> re&shy;
<lb />turned <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE189">and if something is not speedily done
<lb />for him, I fear he will be utterly lost.  The agitation
<lb />of his mind baffles all the power of medicine, and till
<lb />that is relieved, his health can never be restored.
<lb />His spirit, probably always too high for his rank in
<lb />life, now struggles against every attack of sickness
<lb />and of poverty, in preference to yielding to his fate,
<lb />and applying to his friends for their interest and
<lb />assistance.  I mean not to vindicate his obduracy, yet
<lb />I wish it were possible it could be surmounted.  In&shy;

<p><lb /><q id="CE190">Pecuniary assistance he will not accept,</q> she

	  <lb />abroad, strongly recommending <persName>Belf<sic corr="iel">ile</sic>d</persName> to him in ca&shy;
<lb />pacity of a tutor.</p>
<p><lb />A sympathy of sentiment so striking, impressed
<lb />them at the same moment with surprise and esteem:
<lb />Delvile earnestly regarded her with eyes of speaking
<lb />admiration, while the occasion of his notice rendered
<lb />it too pleasant to distress her, and filled her with an
<lb />inward satisfaction which brightened her whole coun&shy;
<lb />tenance.</p>
<p><lb />She had only time, in a manner that strongly marked
	  <lb />her approbation, to return the letter, before <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName> again made her appearance.</p>
<p><lb />During the rest of the evening but little was said;
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was not talkative, and young <persName>Delvile</persName> was so
<lb />absent, that three times his mother reminded him of
<lb />an engagement to meet his father, who that night was
	  <lb />expected at the Duke of <placeName>Derwent's</placeName> house in town,
<lb />before he heard that she spoke to him, and three times
<lb />more before, when he had heard, he obeyed.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, when she came back to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s, found
<lb />the house full of company.  She went into the draw&shy;
<pb n="332" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2S4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">328</mw>
<lb />ing-room, but did not remain there long; she was
<lb />grave and thoughtful, she wished to be alone, and by
<lb />the earliest opportunity stole away to her own apart&shy;
<lb />ment.</p>
<p><lb />Her mind was now occupied by new ideas, and her
<lb />fancy was busied in the delineation of new prospects.
<lb />She had been struck from her first meeting young
<lb />Delvile with an involuntary admiration of his man&shy;
<lb />ners and conversation; she had found upon every
<lb />succeeding interview something further to approve,
<lb />and felt for him a rising partiality which made her
<lb />always see him with pleasure, and never part from
<lb />him without a wish to see him again.  Yet, as she
<lb />was not of that inflammable nature which is always
<lb />ready to take fire, as her passions were under the con&shy;
<lb />troul of her reason, and she suffered not her affections
<lb />to triumph over her principles, she started at her
<lb />danger the moment she perceived it, and instantly de&shy;
<lb />termined to give no weak encouragement to a prepos&shy;
<lb />session which neither time nor intimacy had justified.
<lb />She denied herself the deluding satisfaction of dwel&shy;
<lb />ling upon the supposition of his worth, was unusually
<lb />assiduous to occupy all her time, that her heart might
<lb />have less leisure for imagination; and had she found
<lb />that his character degenerated from the promise of his
<lb />appearance, the well-regulated purity of her mind
<lb />would soon have enabled to have driven him wholly
<lb />from her thoughts.</p>
<p><lb />Such was her situation when the circumstances of
<lb />her affairs occasioned her becoming an inmate of his
<lb />house; and here she grew less guarded, because less
<lb />clear-sighted to the danger of negligence, for the
<lb />frequency of their conversations allowed her little
<pb n="333" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2T1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">329</mw>
<lb />time to consider their effects.  If at first she had
<lb />been pleased with his deportment and elegance,
<lb />upon intimacy she was charmed with his disposition
<lb />and his behaviour; she found him manly, generous,
<lb />open-hearted, and amiable, fond of literature, de&shy;
<lb />lighting in knowledge, kind in his temper, and spirited
<lb />in his actions.</p>
<p><lb />Qualities such as these, when recommended by high
<lb />birth, a striking figure, and polished manners, formed
<lb />but a dangerous companion for a young woman, who,
<lb />without the guard of any former prepossession, was so
<lb />fervent an admirer of excellence as <persName>Cecilia</persName>.  Her
<lb />heart made no resistance, for the attack was too gentle
<lb />and too gradual to alarm her vigilance, and therefore,
<lb />though always sensible of the pleasure she received
	  <lb />from his society, it was not till she returned to <placeName>Port&shy;
<lb />man-Square</placeName>, after having lived under the same roof
<lb />with him for a fortnight, that she was conscious her
<lb />happiness was no longer in her own power.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s house, which had never pleased her,
<lb />now became utterly disgustful; she was wearied and
<lb />uncomfortable; yet, willing to attribute her uneasi&shy;
<lb />ness to any other than the true cause, she fancied the
<lb />house itself was changed, and that all its inhabitants
<lb />and visitors were more than usually disagreeable:
<lb />but this idle error was of short duration, the moment
	  <lb />of self-conviction was at hand, and when <persName>Delvile</persName> pre&shy;
<lb />sented her the letter he had written for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<lb />it flashed in her eyes!</p>
<p><lb />This detection of the altered state of her mind,
<lb />opened to her views and her hopes a scene entirely
<lb />new, for neither the exertion of the most active bene&shy;
<lb />volence, nor the steady course of the most virtuous
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">No.&blank;14.</mw>

<milestone unit="sig" n="2T1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">330</mw>
<lb />conduct, sufficed any longer to wholly engage her
<lb />thoughts, or constitute her felicity; she had purposes
<lb />that came nearer home, and cares that threatened to
<lb />absorb in themselves that heart and those faculties
<lb />which hitherto had only seemed animated for the ser&shy;
<lb />vice of others.</p>
<p><lb />Yet this loss of mental freedom gave her not
<lb />much uneasiness, since the choice of her heart, though
<lb />involuntary, was approved by her principles, and con&shy;
	  <lb />firmed by her judgment.  Young <persName>Delvile's</persName> situation
<lb />in life was just what she wished, more elevated than
<lb />her own, yet not so exalted as to humble her with a
<lb />sense of inferiority; his connections were honourable,
<lb />his mother appeared to her the first of women, his cha&shy;
<lb />racter and disposition seemed formed to make her
<lb />happy, and her own fortune was so large, that to the
<lb />state of his she was indifferent.</p>
<p><lb />Delighted with so flattering a union of inclination
<lb />with propriety, she now began to cherish the partiality
<lb />she at first repressed, and thinking the future destina&shy;
<lb />tion of her life already settled, looked forward with
<lb />grateful joy to the prospect of ending her days with
<lb />the man she thought most worthy to be entrusted with
<lb />the disposal of her fortune.</p>
<p><lb />She had not, indeed, any certainty that the regard
<lb />of young <persName>Delvile</persName> was reciprocal, but she had every
<lb />reason to believe he greatly admired her, and to sus&shy;
<lb />pect that his mistaken notion of her prior engage&shy;
	  <lb />ment, first with <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, and afterwards with <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert Floyer</persName>, made him at present check those sen&shy;
<lb />timents in her favour which, when that error was re&shy;
<lb />moved, she hoped to see encouraged.</p>
<p><lb />Her purpose, therefore, was quietly to wait an ex&shy;
<pb n="335" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2T2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">331</mw>
<lb />planation, which she rather wished retarded than for&shy;
<lb />warded, that her leisure and opportunity might be
<lb />more for investigating his character, and saving her&shy;
<lb />self from repentance.</p></div>

<p>
	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> day following this happy intellectual arrange&shy;
<lb />ment, <persName>Cecilia</persName> was visited by <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.  That
<lb />gentleman, who had enquired for her immediately
	  <lb />after the <name>Harrels</name> went to their villa, and who had
<lb />flattered himself with reaping much advantage from
<lb />their absence, by frequent meetings and confidential
<lb />discourses, suffered the severest mortification when he
<lb />found that her stay in town rendered her not the less
<lb />inaccessible to him, since he had no personal acquain&shy;
	  <lb />tance with the <name>Delviles</name>, and could not venture to
<lb />present himself at their house.</p>
<p><lb />He was now received by her with more than usual
<lb />pleasure; the time had seemed long to her since she
<lb />had conversed with him, and she was eager to ask his
<lb />counsel and assistance in her affairs.  She related to
	  <lb />him the motives which had induced her to go to <placeName>St.
<lb />James's Square</placeName>, and the incorrigible obstinacy with
<lb />which <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> still continued to encourage the
<lb />addresses of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>; she earnestly en&shy;
<lb />treated him to become her agent in a business to
<lb />which she was unequal, by expostulating in her cause
<pb n="336" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2T2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">332</mw>
	  <lb />with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and by calling upon <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
<lb />himself to insist upon his foregoing his unauthorised
<lb />pretensions.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> listened ea<sic corr="">r</sic>gerly to her account and
<lb />request, and when she had finished, assured her he
<lb />would deliberate upon each circumstance of the affair,
<lb />and then maturely weigh every method he could de&shy;
<lb />vise to extricate her from an embarrassment which
<lb />now grew far too serious to be safely neglected.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN15">I will not, however,</q> continued he, <q id="MN16">either act
<lb />or give my opinion without further enquiry, as I am
<lb />confident there is a mystery in this business which
	    <lb />lies deeper than we can at present fathom.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> has doubtless purposes of his own to answer
	    <lb />by this pretended zeal for <persName>Sir Robert</persName>; nor is it diffi&shy;
<lb />cult to conjecture what they may be.  Friendship, in
<lb />a man of his light cast, is a mere cover, a mere name,
<lb />to conceal a connection which has its basis solely in
<lb />the licentious convenience of borrowing money, going
<lb />to the same gaming house, and mutually communica&shy;
<lb />ting and boasting their mutual vices and intrigues,
<lb />while, all the time, their regard for each other is
<lb />equally hollow with their regard for truth and inte&shy;
<lb />grity.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then cautioned her to be extremely careful with
<lb />respect to any money transactions with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />whose splendid extravagance he assured her was uni&shy;
<lb />versally known to exceed his fortune.</p>
<p><lb />The countenance of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, during this exhortation
<lb />was testimony sufficient to the penetrating eyes of
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> that his advice came not too soon:  a
<lb />suspicion of the real state of the case speedily occured
<lb />to him, and he questioned her minutely upon the
<pb n="337" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2T3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">333</mw>
<lb />subject.  She endeavoured to avoid making him any
<lb />answer, but his discernment was t<sic corr="">o</sic> keen for her ar&shy;
<lb />tificial evasion, and he very soon gathered all the
	  <lb />particulars of her transactions with <persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Harrel</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />He was less alarmed at the sum she had lent him,
<lb />which was rather within his expectations, than at the
<lb />method she had been induced to take to procure it.
<lb />He represented to her in the strongest manner the
<lb />danger of imposition, nay of ruin, from the extortions
<lb />and the craft of money-lenders; and he charged her
<lb />upon no consideration to be tempted or persuaded
<lb />again to have recourse to such perilous expedients.</p>
<p><lb />She promised the most attentive observance of his
<lb />advice; and then told him the acquaintance she
	  <lb />had made with <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, and her sorrow for the
<lb />situation of her brother; though, satisfied for the
<lb />present with the plan of young <persName>Delvile</persName>, she now gave
<lb />up her design of soliciting his counsel.</p>
<p><lb />In the midst of this conversation, a note was deli&shy;
<lb />vered to her from <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> senior, acquainting her
<lb />with his return to town, and begging the favour of her
	  <lb />to call in <placeName>St. James's Square</placeName> the next morning, as he
<lb />wished to speak to her upon some business of impor&shy;
<lb />tance.</p>
<p><lb />The eager manner in which <persName>Cecilia</persName> accepted this
<lb />invitation, and her repeated and earnest exclamation
<lb />of wonder at what <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> could have to say,
<lb />past not unnoticed by <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>; he instantly
	  <lb />turned the discourse from the <name>Belfields</name>, the <name>Harrels</name>,
<lb />and the Baronet, to enquire how she had spent her
	  <lb />time during her visit in <placeName>St. James's Square</placeName>, and what
<lb />was her opinion of the family after her late oppor&shy;
<lb />tunities of intimacy?</p>
<pb n="338" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2T3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">334</mw>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> answered that she had yet seen nothing
<lb />more of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, who had been absent the whole
<lb />time, but with equal readiness and pleasure she re&shy;
<lb />plied to all his questions concerning his lady, expatia&shy;
<lb />ting with warmth and fervour upon her many rare and
<lb />estimable qualities.</p>
<p><lb />But when the same interrogatories were transferred
<lb />to the son, she spoke no longer with the same ease, nor
<lb />with her usual promptitude of sincerity; she was
<lb />embarrassed, her answers were short, and she endea&shy;
<lb />voured to hasten from the subject.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> remarked this change with the most
<lb />apprehensive quickness, but forcing a smile, <q id="MN17">Have
<lb />you yet,</q> he said, <q id="MN18">observed the family compact in
<lb />which those people are bound to besiege you, and
<lb />draw you into their snares?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE192">No, indeed,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much hurt by the
<lb />question, <q id="CE193">I am sure no such compact has been
<lb />formed; and I am sure, too, that if you knew them
<lb />better, you would youself be the first to admire and
<lb />do them justice.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN19">My dear <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> cried he, <q id="MN20">I know them
<lb />already; I do not, indeed, visit them, but I am per&shy;
<lb />fectly acquainted with their characters, which have
<lb />been drawn to me by those who are most closely
<lb />connected with them, and who have had opportunities
<lb />of inspection which I hope will never fall to your
<lb />share, since I am satisfied the trial would pain, though
<lb />the proof would convince you.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="CE194">What then have you heard of them?</q> cried <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>, with much earnestness, <q id="CE195">it is, at least, not pos&shy;
<lb />sible any ill can be said of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN21">I beg your pardon,</q> returned he, <q id="MN22"><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>

<lb />she has only more art in disguising her foibles; be&shy;
<lb />cause, tho' she is the daughter of pride, she is the
<lb />slave of interest.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE196">I see you have been greatly misinformed,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> warmly; <q id="CE197"><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> is the noblest of

<p><note type="temp" resp="JBomze.nln"><p>Should the following 'him' read 'her'?</p></note>

<p><lb /><q rend="post()" id="CE198">And what knowledge of her, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,

<p><lb /><q id="MN25">I will tell you,</q> answered he, <q id="MN26">with all the open&shy;
<lb />ness you have a claim to from my regard, and then,
	    <lb />leave to time to shew if I am mistaken.  The <name>Delvile</name>
<lb />family, notwithstanding its ostentatious magnificence,
<lb />I can solemnly assure you, is poor in every branch,
<lb />alike lineal and collateral.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But is it therefore the less estimable?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, because the more rapacious.  And while
<lb />they count on each side Dukes, Earls and Barons in
<lb />their genealogy, the very wealth with which, through
<lb />your means, they project the support of their insolence,
<lb />and which they will grasp with all the greediness of
<lb />avarice, they will think honoured by being employed
<lb />in their service, while the instrument, all amiable as
<lb />she is, by which they attain it, will be constantly held
<lb />down as the disgrace of their alliance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, stung to the soul by this speech, rose from
<pb n="340" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2T4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">336</mw>
<lb />her chair, unwilling to answer it, yet unable to con&shy;
<lb />ceal how much it shocked her.  <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, per&shy;
<lb />ceiving her emotion, followed her, and taking her
<lb />hand, said, <q>I would not give this warning to one I
<lb />thought too weak to profit from it; but as I am well
<lb />informed of the use that is meant to be made of your
<lb />fortune, and the abuse that will follow of yourself, I
<lb />think it right to prepare you for their artifices, which
<lb />merely to point out may render abortive.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, too much disturbed to thank him, drew
<lb />back her hand, and continued silent.  <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
<lb />reading through her displeasure the state of her affec&shy;
<lb />tions, saw with terror the greatness of the danger
<lb />which threatened him.  He found, however, that the
<lb />present was no time for enforcing objections, and
<lb />perceiving he had already gone too far, though he was
<lb />by no means disposed to recant, he thought it most
<lb />prudent to retreat, and let her mediate upon his
<lb />exhortation while its impression was yet strong in her
<lb />mind.</p>
<p><lb />He would now, therefore, have taken leave; but
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, endeavouring to recollect herself, and fully
<lb />persuaded that however he had shocked her, he had
<lb />only her interest in view, stopt him, saying <q>You
<lb />think me, perhaps, ungrateful, but believe me I am
<lb />not; I must, however, acknowledge that your censure
<lb />of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> hurts me extremely.  Indeed I cannot
<lb />doubt her worthiness; I must still, therefore, plead
<lb />for her, and I hope the time will come when you
<lb />will allow I have not pleaded unjustly.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN27">Justly or unjustly,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
<lb /><q id="MN28">I am at least sure you can never plead vainly.  I
<lb />give up, therefore, to your opinion my attack of Mrs.

<milestone unit="sig" n="2U1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">337</mw>
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, and am willing from your commendations to
<lb />suppose her the best of the race.  Nay, I will even
<lb />own that perhaps <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> himself, as well as his
<lb />lady, might pass through life and give but little offence,
<lb />had they only themselves to think of, and no son to
<lb />stimulate their arrogance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE200">Is the son, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName> faintly, <q id="CE201">so much
<lb />the more culpable?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN29">The son, I believe,</q> answered he, <q id="MN30">is at least
<lb />the chief incentive to insolence and ostentation in the
<lb />parents, since it is for his sake they covet with such
<lb />avidity honours and riches, since they plume them&shy;
<lb />selves upon regarding him as the support of their name
<lb />and family, and since their pride in him even surpasses
<lb />their pride in their lineage and themselves.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah! thought <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and of such a son who could
<lb />help being proud!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN31">Their purpose, therefore,</q> he continued,
 <q id="MN32">is to
<lb />secure through his means your fortune, which they
<lb />will no sooner obtain, than, to my certain knowledge,
<lb />they mean instantly, and most unmercifully, to employ
<lb />it in repairing all their dilapidated estates.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then he quitted the subject:  and, with that
<lb />guarded warmth which accompanied all his expressions,
<lb />told her he would carefully watch for her honour and
<lb />welfare, and, repeating his promise of endeavouring
<lb />to discover the tie by which <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> seemed bound
<lb />to the Baronet, he left her&mdash; &mdash;&mdash;a prey himself to an
<lb />anxiety yet more severe than that with which he had
<lb />filled her!  He now saw all his long-cherished hopes
<lb />in danger of final destruction, and suddenly cast upon

<p><lb />Mean while <persName>Cecilia</persName>, disturbed from the calm of soft

<lb />objections, and threatening with difficulties.  The
<lb />representations of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had cruelly morti&shy;
<lb />fied her; well acquainted with his knowledge of the
<lb />world, and wholly unsuspicious of his selfish motives,
<lb />she gave to his assertions involuntary credit, and even
<lb />while she attempted to combat them, they made upon

<p><lb /><q id="DE47">I have applied,</q> continued he, <q id="DE48">to <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />to know if the communication which I had recom&shy;
<lb />mended to you, and to which she had promised her at&shy;
<lb />tention, had yet passed; but I am informed you have
<lb />not spoken to her upon the subject.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE202">I had nothing, Sir, to communicate,</q> answered
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE203">and I had hoped, as <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> made no
<lb />enquiries, she was satisfied she had nothing to hear.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="DE49">With respect to enquiries,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,

<milestone unit="sig" n="2U2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">340</mw>
<lb /><q id="DE50">I fear you are not sufficiently aware of the distance
<lb />between a lady of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>'s rank, both by birth
	    <lb />and alliance, and such a young woman as <persName>Mrs. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName>, whose ancestors, but a short time since, were mere
<lb />Suffolk farmers.  But I beg your pardon:&mdash; &mdash;I mean
<lb />not any reflection upon yours:  I have always heard
<lb />they were very worthy people.  And a farmer is cer&shy;
<lb />tainly a very respectable person.  Your father, I
<lb />think, no more than the Dean your uncle, did nothing
<lb />in that way himself?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName> drily, and much provoked
<lb />by this contemptuous courtesy.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I have always been told he was a very good sort
<lb />of man:  I knew none of the family myself, but the
<lb />Dean.  His connection with the Bishop of &mdash; &mdash;, my
<lb />relation, put him often in my way.  Though his nam&shy;
<lb />ing me for one of his trustees, I must own, was rather
<lb />extraordinary; but I mean not to hurt you; on the
<lb />contrary, I should be much concerned to give you any
<lb />uneasiness.</q></p>
<p><lb />Again <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> arose in the mind of <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />and again she acknowledged the truth of his stric&shy;
<lb />tures; and though she much wondered in what an
<lb />harangue so pompous was to end, her disgust so far
<lb />conquered her curiosity, that without hearing it she
<lb />wished herself away.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="DE51">To return,</q> said he, <q id="DE52">to my purpose.  The pre&shy;
<lb />sent period of your life is such as to render advice par&shy;
<lb />ticularly seasonable; I am sorry, therefore, as I be&shy;
<lb />fore said, you have not disclosed your situation to
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.  A young lady on the point of making
<lb />an establishment, and with many engagements in her
<lb />power, is extremely liable to be mistaken in her judg&shy;
<pb n="345" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2U3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">341</mw>
<lb />ment, and therefore should solicit instruction from
<lb />those who are able to acquaint her what connection
<lb />would be most to her advantage.  One thing, how&shy;
<lb />ver, I am happy to commend, the young man that was
<lb />wounded in the duel&mdash;&mdash;I cannot recollect his name,
<lb />is, I hear, totally out of the question.</q></p>
<p><lb />What next? thought <persName>Cecilia</persName>; though still she gave
<lb />him no interruption, for the haughtiness of his manner
<lb />was repulsive to reply.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q>My design, therefore, is to speak to you of <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert Floyer</persName>.  When I had last the pleasure of ad&shy;
<lb />ressing you upon this subject, you may probably re&shy;
<lb />member my voice was in his favour:  but then I re&shy;
<lb />garded him merely as the rival of an inconsiderable
<lb />young man, to rescue you from whom he appeared an
<lb />eligible person.  The affair is now altered, that
<lb />young man is thought of no more, and another rival
<lb />comes forward, to whom Sir Robert is as inconsider&shy;
<lb />able as the first rival was to Sir Robert.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> started at this information, livelier sensa&shy;
<lb />tions stimulated her curiosity, and surmises in which
<lb />she was most deeply interested quickened her atten&shy;
<lb />tion.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="DE53">This rival,</q> proceeded he, <q id="DE54">I should imagine no
<lb />young lady would a moment hesitate in electing; he
	    <lb />is every way the superior of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, except in for&shy;
<lb />tune, and the deficiencies of that the splendour of your
<lb />own may amply supply.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />The deepest crimson now tinged the cheeks of <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>; the propecy of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> seemed immedi&shy;
<lb />ately fulfilling, and she trembled with a rising conflict
<lb />between her approbation of the offer, and her dread
<lb />of its consequences.</p>
<pb n="346" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">342</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q id="DE55">I know not, indeed,</q> continued he, <q id="DE56">in what esti&shy;
<lb />mation you may have been accustomed to hold rank
<lb />and connection, nor whether you are impressed with
<lb />a proper sense of their superiority and value; for early
<lb />prejudices are not easily rooted out, and those who
<lb />have lived chiefly with monied people, regard even
<lb />birth itself as unimportant when compared with
<lb />wealth.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />The colour which first glowed in the cheeks of <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName> from expectation, now rose yet higher from re&shy;
<lb />sentment:  she thought herself already insulted by a
<lb />prelude so ostentatious and humiliating to the propo&shy;
<lb />sals which were to follow; and she angrily deter&shy;
<lb />mined, with whatever pain to her heart, to assert her
<lb />own dignity, by refusing them at once, too well satis&shy;

<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()" id="DE57">Your rejection, therefore,</q> continued he, <q id="DE58">of

<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">That,</q><sic corr="&amp;rdquo;"></sic> replied <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
<q>is little to the pur&shy;
<lb />psoe; where the connexion is a proper one, a young
<lb />lady of delicacy has only to accede to it.  But though
<lb />this rejection came not immediately from yourself, it
<lb />had doubtless your concurrence.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It had not, Sir, even my knowledge.</q></p>

<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">Your alliance then with <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> is pro&shy;
<lb />bably nearer a conclusion than I had imagined, for
<lb />otherwise <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> would not, without consulting

<p><lb /><q id="CE205">No, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, impatiently, <q id="CE206">my alliance
<lb />with him was never more distant, nor do I mean it

<p><lb />She was now little disposed for further conversa&shy;
<lb />tion.  Her heroic design of refusing young <persName>Delvile</persName> by
<lb />no means reconciled her to the discovery she now
<lb />made that he had not meant to address her; and
<lb />though she was provoked and fretted at this new proof
<lb />that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> scrupled neither assertions nor ac&shy;
	  <lb />tions to make her engagement with <persName>Sir Robert</persName> cre&shy;
<lb />dited, her disappointment in finding that <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />instead of pleading the cause of his son, was exerting
<lb />his interest for another person, affected her so much
<lb />more nearly, that notwithstanding he still continued
<lb />his parading harangue, she scarcely knew even the
<lb />subject of his discourse, and seized the first opportu&shy;
<lb />nity of a cessation, to rise and take her leave.</p>
<p>	  <lb />He asked her if she would not call upon <persName>Mrs. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>; but desirous to be alone, she declined the invi&shy;
<lb />tation:  he then charged her to proceed no further with
<lb />Sir Robert till he had made some enquiries concern&shy;

<lb />tection and counsel, suffered her to depart.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now perceived she might plan her rejections,
	  <lb />or study her dignity at her leisure, for neither <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName> nor his son seemed in any haste to put her

<lb />timents, she had every reason to believe him right:

<p><lb /><q id="AR23">Ah madam!</q> cried <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, mournfully, <q id="AR24">and
<lb />how? he has no means to pay them, and I have none
<lb />&mdash;without ruin to myself,&mdash;to help him!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE235">Send them but away,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE236">and I will
<lb />myself be your security that your promise shall not
<lb />be disgraced.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="AR25">Alas, madam,</q> cried he, <q id="AR26">what are you doing!
<lb />well as I wish to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, miserable as I am for
<lb /><sic corr="">for</sic> my unfortunate sister, I yet cannot bear that such
<lb />goodness, such beneficence should be injured!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, persisted, and with evident reluc&shy;
<lb />tance he obeyed her.</p>
<p>	  <lb />While she waited her return, <persName>Davison</persName> came from
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who had ordered him to run instantly for
	  <lb />the <name>Jew</name>.</p>

<p>
<lb />Good Heaven, thought <persName>Cecilia</persName>, that a man so
<lb />wretchedly selfish and wordly, should dare, with all
<lb />his guilt upon his head,
<lb /><quote rend="align(block)pre()post()">To rush unlicened on eternity!</quote></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> was more than half an hour with the
<lb />people; and when, at last, he returned, his countenance
<lb />immediately proclaimed the ill success of his errand.</p>
<p><lb />The creditors, he said, declared they had so frequently
<lb />been deceived, that they would not dismiss the bailiffs,
<lb />or retire themselves, without actual payment.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE237">Tell them, then, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE238">to send me
<lb />their accounts, and if it be possible, I will discharge
<lb />them directly.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>'s eyes were filled with tears at this
<lb />declaration, and he protested, be the consequence to
<lb />himself what it might, he would pay away every
<lb />shilling he was worth, rather than witness such in&shy;
<lb />justice.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE239">No,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, exerting more spirit, that she
<lb />might shock him less, <q id="CE240">I did not save <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, to
<lb />destroy so much better a man! you have suffered but
<lb />too much oppression already; the present evil is mine;
<lb />and from me, at least, none I hope will ever spread
<lb />to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> could not bear this; he was struck
<lb />with grief, with admiration, and with gratitude, and
<lb />finding his tears now refused to be restrained, he went
<lb />to execute her commission in silent dejection.</p>
<p><lb />The dejection, however, was encreased, though his
<lb />tears were dispersed, when he returned; <q id="AR27">Oh ma&shy;
<pb n="356" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2X4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">352</mw>
<lb />dam!</q> he cried, <q id="AR28">all your efforts, generous as they are,
<lb />will be of no avail! the bills even now in the house
<lb />amount to more than 7000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>.!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, amazed and confounded, started and
<lb />clasped her hands, calling out, <q>What must I do!
<lb />to what have bound myself! and how can I answer
<lb />to my conscience,&mdash;to my successors, such a disposal,
<lb />such an abuse of so large a part of my fortune!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> could make no answer; and they stood
	  <lb />looking at each other in silent irresolution, till <persName>Davison</persName>
	  <lb />brought intelligence that the <name>Jew</name> was already come,
<lb />and waited to speak with her.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE241">And what can I say to him?</q> cried she, more
<lb />and more agitated; <q id="CE242">I understand nothing of usury;
<lb />how am I to deal with him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> then confessed that he should himself
<lb />have instantly been bail for his brother, but that his
<lb />fortune, originally not large, was now so much im&shy;
<lb />paired by the many debts which from time to time he
<lb />had paid for him, that as he hoped some day<sic corr="&amp;blank;"></sic>to have
<lb />a family of his own, he dared not run a risk by which
<lb />he might be utterly ruined, and the less, as his sister
	  <lb />had at <placeName>Violet Bank</placeName> been prevailed upon to give up
<lb />her settlement.</p>
<p><lb />This account, which explained the late uneasiness
<lb />of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, still encreased the distress of <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb />and every moment she obtained for reflection, aug&shy;
<lb />mented her reluctance to parting with so large a sum
<lb />of money for so worthless an object, and added strength
<lb />to her resentment for the unjustifiable menaces which
<lb />had extorted from her such a promise.  Yet not an
<lb />instant would she listen to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>'s offer of ful&shy;
<lb />filling her engagement, and charged him, as she con&shy;
<pb n="357" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Y1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">353</mw>
<lb />sidered her own self-esteem worth her keeping, not
<lb />to urge to her a proposal so ungenerous and selfish.</p>
<p><lb />Davison now came again to hasten her, and said
	  <lb />that the <name>Jew</name> was with his master, and they both im&shy;
<lb />patiently expected her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, half distracted with her uncertainty how
<lb />to act, changed colour at this message, and exclaim&shy;
	  <lb />ed, <q>Oh <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, run I beseech you, for <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>! bring him hither directly,&mdash;if any body
<lb />can save me it is him; but if I go back to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />I know it will be all over!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="AR29">Certainly,</q> said <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, <q id="AR30">I will run to him
<lb />this moment.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE243">Yet no!&mdash;stop!&mdash;</q> cried the trembling <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q id="CE244">he can now do me no good,&mdash;his counsel will arrive
<lb />too late to serve me,&mdash;it cannot call back the oath I
<lb />have given! it cannot, compulsatory as it was, make
<lb />me break it, and not be miserable for ever!</q></p>
<p><lb />This idea sufficed to determine her:  and the appre&shy;
	  <lb />hension of self-reproach, should the threat of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> be put in execution, was more insupportable
<lb />to her blameless and upright mind, than any loss or
<lb />dimunition which her fortune could sustain.</p>
<p><lb />Slowly however, with tardy and unwilling steps,
<lb />her judgment repugnant, and her spirit repining, she
<lb />obeyed the summons of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who impatient
<lb />of her delay, came forward to meet her.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA44"><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> he cried, <q id="HA45">there is not a moment
<lb />to be lost; this good man will bring you any sum of
<lb />money, upon a proper consideration that you will
<lb />command; but if he is not immediately commissioned,
<lb />and these cursed fellows are not got out of my house,
<lb />the affair will be blown,&mdash;&mdash;and what will follow,</q>

<lb />added he, lowering his voice, <q>I will not again
<lb />frighten you by repeating, though I shall never re&shy;
<lb />cant.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> turned from him in horror; and, with a
<lb />faultering voice and heavy heart, entreated <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
	  <lb />to settle for her with the <name>Jew</name>.</p>
<p><lb />Large as was the sum, she was so near being of
<lb />age, and her security was so good, that the trans&shy;
<lb />action was soon finished<sic corr=".">?</sic>  7500<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. was received of the
	  <lb /><name>Jew</name>, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> gave <persName>Cecilia</persName> his bond for the pay&shy;
<lb />ment, the Creditors were satisfied, the bailiffs were
<lb />dismissed, and the house was soon restored to its
<lb />customary appearance of splendid gaiety.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who during this scene had shut her&shy;
<lb />self up in her own room to weep and lament, now flew
<lb />to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and in a transport of joy and gratitude,
<lb />thanked her upon her knees for thus preserving her
<lb />from utter ruin:  the gentle <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> seemed un&shy;
	  <lb />certain whether most to grieve or rejoice, and <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> repeatedly protested she should have the sole
<lb />guidance of his future conduct.</p>
<p><lb />This promise, the hope of his amendment, and the
<lb />joy she had expanded, somewhat revived the spirits of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>:  who, however, deeply affected by what had
<lb />passed, hastened from them all to her own room.</p>
<p><lb />She had now parted with 8050<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />without any security when or how it was to be paid;
<lb />and that ardour of benevolence which taught her to
<lb />value her riches merely as they enabled her to do
<lb />good and generous actions, was here of no avail to
<lb />console or reward her, for her gift was compelled, and
<lb />its receiver was all but detested. <q id="CE245">How much better,</q>
<lb />cried she, <q id="CE246">would this have been bestowed upon the
<pb n="359" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Y2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">355</mw>
	    <lb />amiable <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>! or upon her noble-minded,
<lb />though proud-spirited brother! and how much less a
<lb />sum would have made the virtuous and industrious
	    <lb /><name>Hills</name> easy and happy for life! but here, to become the
<lb />tool of the extravagance I abhor! to be made respon&shy;
<lb />sible for the luxury I condemn! to be liberal in oppo&shy;
<lb />sition to my principles, and lavish in defiance of my
<lb />judgement!&mdash;Oh that my much-deceived uncle had
<lb />better known to what dangerous hands he committed
<lb />me! and that my weak and unhappy friend had met
<lb />with a worthier protector of her virtue and safety!</q></p>
<p><lb />As soon, however, as she recovered from the first
<lb />shock of her reflections, she turned her thoughts from
<lb />herself to the formation of some plan that might, at
<lb />least, render her donation of serious and lasting use<sic corr=".">-</sic>
<lb />The signal service she had just done then gave her at
	  <lb />present an ascendancy over the <name>Harrels</name>, which she
<lb />hoped, if immediately exerted, might prevent the
<lb />return of so calamitious a scene, by engaging them
<lb />both to an immediate change of ocnduct.  But un&shy;
<lb />equal herself to contriving expedients for this purpose
<lb />that might not easily be controverted, she determined
<lb />to send the next morning a petition to <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>
<lb />to call upon her, reveal to him the whole transaction,
<lb />and entreat him to suggest to her what, with most
<lb />probability of success, she might offer to their con&shy;
<lb />sideration.</p>
<p><lb />While this was passing in her mind, on the evening
<lb />of the day in which she had so dearly purchased the
<lb />right of giving counsel, she was summoned to tea.</p>
<p><lb />She found <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and his lady engaged in
<lb />earnest discourse:  as soon as she appeared, the former
<lb />said, <q id="HA46">My dear <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, after the extraordi&shy;

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">356</mw>
<lb />nary kindness you have shewn me this morning, you
<lb />will not, I am sure, deny me one trifling favour which
<lb />I mean to ask this evening.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="HR8">No,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q id="HR9">that I am sure she will
<lb />not, when she knows that our future appearance in
<lb />the world depends upon her granting it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE247">I hope then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE248">I shall not wish to
<lb />refuse it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA47">It is nothing in the world,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb /><q id="HA48">but to go with us to-night to the Pantheon.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was struck with the utmost indignation at
<lb />this proposal; that the man who in the morning had
<lb />an execution in his house, should languish in the
<lb />evening for the amusement of a public place,&mdash;that he
<lb />who but a few hours before was plunging uncalled
<lb />into eternity, should, while the intended instrument
<lb />of death was yet scarce cold from the grasp of his
<lb />hand, deliberately court a return of his distress, by
<lb />instantly recurring to the methods which had involved
<lb />him in it, irritated and shocked her beyond even a
<lb />wish of disguising her displeasure, and therefore, after
<lb />an expressive silence, she gave a cold, but absolute
<lb />denial.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA49">I see,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, somewhat confused, <q id="HA50">you
<lb />do not understand the motives of our request.  The
<lb />unfortunate affair of this morning is very likely to
<lb />spread presently all over the town; the only refutation
<lb />that can be given to it, is by our all appearing in
<lb />public before any body knows whether to believe it or
<lb />not.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="HR10">Do, my dearest friend,</q> cried his lady, <q id="HR11">oblige
<lb />me by your compliance; indeed our whole reputation
<lb />depends upon it.  I made an engagement yesterday to
<pb n="361" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Y3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">357</mw>
<lb />go with Mrs. Mears, and if I disappoint her, every
<lb />body will be guessing the reason.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE249">At least,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE250"><emph>my</emph> going can
<lb />answer no purpose to you:  pray, therefore, do not
<lb />ask me; I am ill disposed for such sort of amusement,
<lb />and have by no means your opinion of its neces&shy;
<lb />sity.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="HA51">But if we do not <emph>all</emph> go,</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q id="HA52">we
<lb />do almost nothing:  you are known to live with us,
<lb />and your appearance at this critical time is important
<lb />to our credit.  If this misfortune gets wind, the con&shy;
<lb />sequence is that every dirty tradesman in town to
<lb />whom I owe a shilling, will be forming the same
<lb />cursed combination those scoundrels formed this
<lb />morning, of coming in a body, and waiting for their
<lb />money, or else bringing an execution into my house.
<lb />The only way to silence report is by putting a good
<lb />face upon the matter at once, and shewing ourselves
<lb />to the world as if nothing had happened.  Favour us,
<lb />therefore, to-night with your company, which is
<lb />really important to us, or ten to one, but in another
<lb />fortnight, I shall be just in the same scrape.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, however incensed at this intelligence that
<lb />his debts were still so numerous, felt now as much
<lb />alarmed at the mention of an execution, as if she was
<lb />in actual danger of ruin herself.  Terrified, therefore,
<lb />though not convinced, she yielded to their persuasions,
<lb />and consented to accompany them.</p>
<p><lb />They soon after separated to make some alteration
<lb />in their dress, and then, calling in their way for
	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Mears</persName>, they proceeded to the Pantheon.</p></div>

	  <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">At</hi> the door of the Pantheon they were joined by
<lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> and <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, whom <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />now saw with added aversion:  they entered the great
<lb />room during the second act of the Concert, to which,
<lb />as no one of the party but herself had any desire to
<lb />listen, no sort of attention was paid; the ladies enter&shy;
<lb />taining themselves as if no Orchestra was in the room,
<lb />and the gentlemen, with an equal disregard to it,
<lb />struggling for a place by the fire, about which they
<lb />continued hovering till the music was over.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Soon after they were seated, <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, saun&shy;
	  <lb />tering towards them, whispered something to <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Mears</persName>, who, immediately rising, introduced him to
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>; after which, the place next to her being
<lb />vacant, he cast himself upon it, and lolling as much
<lb />at his ease as his situation would permit, began some&shy;
<lb />thing like a conversation with her.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Have you been long in town, ma'am?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>This is not your first winter?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Of being in town, it is.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Then you have something new to see:  O charm&shy;
<lb />ing! how I envy you?&mdash;Are you pleased with the

<p><lb /><q>Very much; I have seen no building at all equal

<lb /><q>You have not been abroad.  Travelling is the
<lb />ruin of all happiness!  There's no looking at a
	    <lb />building here after seeing <placeName>Italy</placeName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Does all happiness, then, depend upon sight of
<lb />buildings?</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, when, turning towards her
<lb />companion, she perceived him yawning with such
<lb />evident inattention to her answer, that not chusing
<lb />to interrupt his reverie, she turned her head another
<lb />way.</p>
<p><lb />For some minutes he took no notice of this; and
<lb />then, as if suddenly recollecting himself, he called
<lb />out hastily <q>I beg your pardon, ma'am, you were
<lb />saying something?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir, nothing worth repeating.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O pray don't punish me so severely as not to let
<lb />me hear it!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though merely not to seem offended at his
<lb />negligence, was then again beginning an answer, when
<lb />looking at him as she spoke, she perceived that he was
<lb />biting his nails with so absent an air, that he appeared
<lb />not to know he had asked any questions.  She there&shy;
<lb />fore broke off, and left him to his cogitation.</p>
<p><lb />Some time after he addressed her again, saying,
<lb /><q>Don't you find this place extremely tiresome,
<lb />ma'am?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE251">Yes, Sir,</q> said she half laughing, <q id="CE252">it is, indeed,
<lb />not very entertaining!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="ME1">Nothing is entertaining,</q> answered he, <q id="ME2">for two
<lb />minutes together.  Things are so little different one
<lb />from another, that there is no making pleasure out of
<lb />any thing.  We go the same dull round for ever;
<lb />nothing new, no variety! all the same thing over
<lb />again!  Are you fond of public places, ma'am?</q></p>
<pb n="364" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Y4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">360</mw>
<p>
	  <lb /><q id="CE253">Yes, Sir, <emph>soberly,</emph> as <persName>Lady Grace</persName> says.</q><q>Then
<lb />I envy you extremely, for you have some amusement
<lb />always in your own power.  How desirable that
<lb />is!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And have not you the same resources?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no!  I am tired to death! tired of every thing!
<lb />I would give the universe for a disposition less dif<sic corr="f"></sic>icult
<lb />to please.  Yet, after all, what is there to give plea&shy;
<lb />sure?  When one has seen one thing, one has seen
<lb />every thing.  O, 'tis heavy work!  Don't you find
<lb />it so, ma'am?</q></p>
<p><lb />This speech was ended with so violent a fit of
<lb />yawning, that <persName>Cecilia</persName> would not trouble herself to
<lb />answer it:  but her silence, as before, passed wholly
<lb />unnoticed, exciting neither question nor comment.</p>
<p><lb />A long pause now succeeded, which he broke at
<lb />last, by saying, as he writhed himself about upon his
<lb />seat, <q>These forms would be much more agreeable if
<lb />there were backs to them.  'Tis intolerable to be
<lb />forced to sit like a school-boy.  The first study of
<lb />life is ease.  There is, indeed, no other study that
<lb />pays the trouble of attainment.  Don't you think so,
<lb />ma'am?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE254">But may not even that,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE255">by so

<p><lb /><q id="CE256">You did very right, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, laughing,

<lb /><q>WIll you do me the favour to repeat it?</q> cried

<p><lb /><q id="CE258">O no,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE259">that would be trying your
<lb />patience too severely.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="ME3">These glasses shew one nothing but defects,</q>
<lb />said he; <q id="ME4">I am sorry they were ever invented.  They
<lb />are the ruin of all beauty; no complexion can stand
<lb />them.  I believe that solo will never be over!  I hate
<lb />a solo; it sinks, it depresses me intolerably.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE260">You will presently, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, looking at
<lb />the bill of the concert, <q id="CE261">have a full piece; and that,

<p><lb /><q>A full piece! oh insupportable! it stuns, it
<lb />fatigues, it overpowers me beyond endurance! no
<lb />taste in it, no delicacy, no room for the smallest

<p><lb /><q>Perhaps, then, you are only fond of singing?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I should be, if I could hear it; but we are now so
<lb />miserably off in voices, that I hardly ever attempt to

<lb />more during the performance than between the acts.
<lb />And what is there better you could substitute in its
<lb />place?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, receiving no answer to this question, again
<lb />looked round to see if she had been heard; when she
<lb />observed her new acquaintance, with a very thought&shy;
<lb />ful air, had turned from her to fix his eyes upon the
	  <lb />statue of <name>Britannia</name>.</p>
<p><lb />Very soon after, he hastily arose, and seeming
<lb />entirely to forget that he had spoken to her, very
<lb />abruptly walked away.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, who was advancing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and had
<lb />watched part of this scene, stopt him as she was re&shy;
	  <lb />treating, and said, <q>Why <persName>Meadows</persName>, how's this? are
<lb />you caught at last?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="ME5">O worn to death! worn to a thread!</q> cried he,
<lb />stretching himself and yawning; <q id="ME6">I have been talking
<lb />with a young lady to entertain her!  O such heavy
<lb />work!  I would not go through it again for mil&shy;
<lb />lions!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What, have you talked yourself out of breath?</q>
<lb /><q>No; but the effort! the effort!&mdash;O, it has un&shy;
<lb />hinged me for a fortnight!&mdash;Entertaining a young
<lb />lady!&mdash;one had better be a galley-slave at once!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well but, did she not pay your toils?  She is
<lb />surely a sweet creature.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nothing can pay one for such insufferable
<lb />exertion! though she's well enough, too,&mdash;better than
<lb />the common run,&mdash;but shy, quite too shy; no drawing
<lb />her out.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I thought that was to your taste.  You commonly
<lb />hate much volubility.  How have I heard you bemoan
<lb />yourself when attacked by <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>!</q></p>
<pb n="367" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">363</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>Larolles?  O distraction!  She talks me into a
<lb />fever in two minutes.  But so it is for ever! nothing
<lb />but extremes to be met with:  common girls are too
<lb />forward, this lady is too reserved&mdash;&mdash;always some
<lb />fault! always some drawback! nothing ever per&shy;
<lb />fect?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="GO1">Nay, nay,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, <q id="GO2">you do not know
<lb />her; she is perfect enough in all conscience.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="ME7">Better not know her then,</q> answered he, again
<lb />yawning, <q id="ME8">for she cannot be pleasing.  Nothing
<lb />perfect is natural:&mdash;&mdash;I hate every thing out of
<lb />nature.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then strolled on, and <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> approached
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="GO3">I have been wishing,</q> cried he, <q id="GO4">to address you
<lb />this half hour, but as you<sic corr="">r</sic> were engaged with Mr.
<lb />Meadows, I did not dare advance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE264">O, I see your malice!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE265">you were
<lb />determined to add weight to the value of your com&shy;
<lb />pany, by making me fully sensible where the balance
<lb />would preponderate.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="GO5">Nay, if you do not admire <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>,</q> cried
<lb />he, <q id="GO6">you must not even whisper it to the winds.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is he then so very admirable?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, he is now in the very height of fashionable fa&shy;
<lb />vour:  his dress is a model, his manners are imitated,
<lb />his attention is courted, and his notice is envied.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Are you not laughing?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, indeed; his privileges are much more ex&shy;
<lb />tensive than I have mentioned:  his decision fixes the
<lb />exact limits between what is vulgar and what is ele&shy;
<lb />gant, his praise gives reputation, and a word from him
<lb />in public confers fashion!</q></p>
<pb n="368" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Z2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">364</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>And by what wonderful powers has he acquired
<lb />such influence?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>By nothing but a happy art in catching the
<lb />reigning foibles of the time, and carrying them to an
<lb />extreme yet more absurd than any one had done be&shy;
<lb />fore him.  Ceremony, he found, was already exploded
<lb />for ease, he therefore exploded ease for indolence;
<lb />devotion to the fair sex, had given way to a more
<lb />equal and rational intercourse, which, to push still
<lb />farther, he presently exchanged for rudeness; jovi&shy;
<lb />ality, too, was already banished for philosophical in&shy;
<lb />difference, and that, therefore, he discarded, for wea&shy;
<lb />riness and disgust.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And is it possible that qualities such as these
<lb />should recommend him to favour and admiration?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Very possible, for qualities such as these consti&shy;
<lb />tute the present state of the times.  A man of the <emph>Ton</emph>
<lb />who would now be conspicuous in the gay world,
<lb />must invariably be insipid, negligent, and selfish.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE266">Admirable requisites!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="CE267">and
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, I acknowledge, seems to have attained
<lb />them all.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="GO7">He must never,</q> continued <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>, <q id="GO8">con&shy;
<lb />fess the least pleasure from any thing, a total apathy
<lb />being the chief ingredient of his character:  he must,
<lb />upon no account, sustain a conversation with any
<lb />spirit, lest he should appear, to his utter disgrace,
<lb />interested in what is said:  and when he is quite tired
<lb />of his existence, from a total vacuity of ideas, he must
<lb />affect a look of absence, and pretend, on the sudden
<lb />to be wholly lost in thought.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE268">I would not wish,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, laughing, <q id="CE269">a
<lb />more amiable a companion!</q></p>
<pb n="369" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">365</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q id="GO9">If he is asked his opinion of any lady,</q> he con&shy;
<lb />tinued, <q id="GO10">he must commonly answer by a grimace;
<lb />and if he is seated next to one, he must take the ut&shy;
<lb />most pains to shew by his listlessness, yawning and
<lb />inattention, that he is sick of his situation; for what
<lb />he holds of all things to be most gothic, is gallantry
<lb />to the women.  To avoid this is, indeed, the prin&shy;
<lb />cipal solicitude of his life.  If he sees a lady in dis&shy;
<lb />tress for her carriage, he is to enquire of her what is
<lb />the matter, and then, with a shrug, wish her well
<lb />through her fatigues, wink at some by-stander, and
<lb />walk away.  If he is in a room where there is a crowd
<lb />of company, and a scarcity of seats, he must early
<lb />ensure one of the best in the place, be blind to all
<lb />looks of fatigue, and deaf to all hints of assistance,
<lb />and seeming totally to forget himself, lounge at his
<lb />ease, and appear as unconscious spectator of what is
<lb />going forward.  If he is at a ball where there are
<lb />more women than men, he must decline dancing at
<lb />all, though it should happen to be his favourite amuse&shy;
<lb />ment, and smiling as he passes the disengaged young
<lb />ladies, wonder to see them sit still, and perhaps ask
<lb />them the reason!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE270">A most alluring character indeed!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb /><q id="CE271">and pray how long have these been the accomplish&shy;
<lb />ments of a fine gentleman?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="GO11">I am but an indifferent chronologer of the modes,</q>
<lb />he answered; <q id="GO12">but I know it has been long enough
<lb />to raise just expectations that some new folly will be
<lb />started soon, by which the present race of <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">insen&shy;
	      <lb />siblists</emph> may be driven out.  <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> is now
<lb />at the head of this sect, as <persName>Miss Larolles</persName> is of the

<lb />lious</emph>.  But this way comes another, who, though
<lb />in a different manner, labours with the same view,
<lb />and aspires at the same reward which stimulate the
<lb />ambition of this happy <emph>Triplet</emph>, that of exciting wonder
<lb />by peculiarity, and envy by wonder.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />This description announced <persName>Capt. Aresby</persName>; who,
<lb />advancing, from the fire-place, told <persName>Cecilia</persName> how much
<lb />he rejoiced in seeing her, said he had been <emph>reduced to
<lb />despair</emph> by so long missing that honour, and that he
<lb />had feared she <emph>made it a principle</emph> to avoid coming
<lb />in public, having sought her in vain <foreign lang="fre">partout</foreign>.</p>
<p><lb />He then smiled, and strolled on to another party.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE272">And pray of what sect,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE273">is this
<lb />gentleman?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="GO13">Of the sect of <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">jargonists</emph>,</q> answered Mr.
<lb />Gosport; <q id="GO14">he has not an ambition beyond paying a
<lb />passing compliment, nor a word to make use of that
<lb />he has not picked up at public places.  Yet this dearth
<lb />of language, however you may despise it, is not
<lb />merely owing to a narrow capacity:  foppery and con&shy;
<lb />ceit have their share in the limitation, for though his
<lb />phrases are almost always ridiculous or misapplied,
<lb />they are selected with much study, and introduced
<lb />with infinite pain.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE274">Poor man!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE275">is it possible it can
<lb />cost him any trouble to render himself so completely
<lb />absurd?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes; but not more than it costs his neighbours to
	    <lb />keep him in countenance.  <persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, since she
<lb />has presided over the sect of the <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">supercilious</emph>,
<lb />spends at least half her life in wishing the annihilation
<lb />of the other half; for as she must only speak in her
<lb />own Coterie, she is compelled to be frequently silent,
<pb n="371" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2Z4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">367</mw>
<lb />and therefore, having nothing to think of, she is com&shy;
<lb />monly gnawn with self-denial, and soured with want
<lb />of amusement:  <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, indeed, is better off,
<lb />for in talking faster than she thinks, she has but fol&shy;
<lb />lowed the natural bent of her disposition:  as to this
<lb />poor <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">jargonist</emph>, he has, I must own, rather a
<lb />hard task, from the continual restraint of speaking only
<lb />out of his own Liliputian vocabulary, and denying
<lb />himself the relief of ever utt<sic corr="">t</sic>ering one word by the
<lb />call of occasion:  but what hardship is that, compared
	    <lb />with what is borne by <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>? who, since he
<lb />commenced <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">insensiblist</emph>, has never once dared
<lb />to be pleased, nor ventured for a moment to look in
<lb />good humour!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()" id="CE276">Surely, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE277">in a short time, the
<lb />punishment of this affectation will bring its cure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No; for the trick grows into habit, and habit, is
<lb />a second nature.  A secret idea of fame makes his
<lb />forbearance of happiness supportable to him; for he
<lb />has now the self-satisfaction of considering himself
<lb />raised to that highest pinnacle of fashionable refine&shy;
<lb />ment which is built upon apathy and scorn, and from
<lb />which, proclaiming himself superior to all possibility
<lb />of enjoyment, he views the whole world with con&shy;
<lb />tempt! holding neither beauty, virtue, wealth nor
<lb />power, of importance sufficient to kindle the smallest
<lb />emotion!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE278">Oh! if they could all round listen to you!</q> cried
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="CE279">they would soon, I think, sicken of their

<p><lb /><q>No; they would but triumph that it had obtained

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">368</mw>
<lb />gentleman, or don't you chuse to know him, who has
<lb />been bowing to you this half hour?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Where?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, looking round, perceived
<lb />Mr. <persName>Morrice</persName>; who, upon her returning his salutation,
<lb />instantly approached her, though he had never
<lb />ventured to shew himself at <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s, since his
<lb />unfortunate accident on the evening of the masque&shy;
<lb />rade.</p>
<p><lb />Entirely casting aside the easy familiarity at which
<lb />he had latterly arrived, he enquired after her health
<lb />with the most fearful diffidence, and then, bowing
<lb />profoundly, was modestly retiring; when <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />perceiving him, smiled with so much good-humour,
<lb />that he gathered courage to return and address her,
<lb />and found her, to his inifnite delight, as obliging and
<lb />civil as ever.</p>
<p><lb />The Concert was now over; the ladies arose, and
<lb />the gentlemen joined them.  <persName>Morrice</persName>, at the sight of
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, was again shrinking; but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />immediately shaking hands with him, enquired what
	  <lb />had kept him so long from <placeName>Portman-Square</placeName>?  <persName>Mor&shy;
<lb />rice</persName> then, finding, to his great surprise, that no one
<lb />had thought more of the mischief but himself who had
<lb />committed it, joyously discarded him timidity, and be&shy;
<lb />came as sprightly as before his mortification.</p>
<p><lb />A motion was now made for going to the tea room;
<lb />and as they walked on, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in looking up to
<lb />examine the building, saw in one of the galleries
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName>, and almost at the same time caught
<lb />his eye.</p>
<p><lb />Scarcely now did a moment elapse before he joined
<lb />her.  The sight of him, strongly reviving in her mind
<pb n="373" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3Ar" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">369</mw>
<lb />the painful contrariety of opinion with which she had
<lb />lately thought of him, the sentiments so much in his
<lb />favour which but a few days before she had encou&shy;
<lb />raged, and which it was only that morning she had
<lb />endeavoured to crush, made her meet him with a kind
<lb />of melancholy that almost induced her to lament he
<lb />was amiable, and repine that she knew none like him.</p>
<p><lb />His appearance, mean time, was far different; he
<lb />seemed enchanted at the sight of her, he flew eagerly
<lb />to meet her, and his eyes sparkled with pleasure as
<lb />he approached her; a pleasure neither moderate
<lb />nor disguised, but lively, unrestrained, and expres&shy;
<lb />sive.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose plans since she had last seen him
<lb />had twice varied, who first had looked forward to
<lb />being united with him for ever, and afterwards had
<lb />determined to avoid with him even a common ac&shy;
<lb />quaintance, could not, while these thoughts were all
<lb />recurring to her memory, receive much delight from
<lb />observing his gaiety, or feel at all gratified by his
<lb />unembarrassed manners.  The openness of his at&shy;
<lb />tentions, and the frankness of his admiration, which
<lb />hiterto had charmed her as marks of the sincerity of
<lb />his character, now shocked her as proofs of the indif&shy;
<lb />ference of his heart, which feeling for her a mere
<lb />common regard, that affected neither his spirits nor
<lb />his peace, he manifested without scruple, since it was
<lb />not accompanied with even a wish beyond the present
<lb />hour.</p>
<p><lb />She now, too, recollected that such had always been
<lb />his conduct, one single and singular moment excepted,
<lb />when, as he gave to her his letter for <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>,
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">Vol.&blank;II.&blank;16.</mw>

<pb n="374" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3Av" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">370</mw>
<lb />he seemed struck, as she was herself, by the extraor&shy;
<lb />dinary co-incidence of their ideas and proceedings:
<lb />that emotion, however, she now regarded as casual
<lb />and transitory, and seeing him so much happier than
<lb />herself, she felt ashamed of her delusion, and angry
<lb />at her easy captivaiton.</p>
<p><lb />Reflections such as these, though they added fresh
<lb />motives to her resolution of giving up all thoughts of
<lb />his alliance, were yet so humiliating, that they robbed
<lb />her of all power of receiving pleasure from what was
<lb />passing, and made her forget that the place she was
<lb />in was even intended for a place of entertainment.</p>
<p><lb />Young Delvile, after painting in lively colours the
<lb />loss his house had sustained by her quitting it, and
<lb />dwelling with equal force upon the regret of his mo&shy;
<lb />ther and his own, asked in a low voice if she would
<lb />do him so much honour as to introduce him to Mr.
<lb />Harrel?  <q id="MO49">As the son,</q> added he, <q id="MO50">of a brother
<lb />guardian, I think I have a kind of claim to his ac&shy;
<lb />quaintance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> could not refuse, though as the request was
<lb />likely to occasion more frequent meetings, she per&shy;
<lb />suaded herself she was unwilling to comply.  The
<lb />ceremony therefore past, and was again repeated
<lb />with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who, though she had several times
<lb />seen him, had never been formally made known to
<lb />him<sic corr=".">,</sic></p>
<p>	  <lb />The <name>Harrels</name> were both of them much pleased at
<lb />this mark of civility in a young man whose family
<lb />had prepared them rather to expect his scorn, and
<lb />expressed their wishes that he would drink his tea in
<lb />their party; he accepted their invitation with ala&shy;
<lb />crity, and turning to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, said, <q>Have I not skil&shy;
<pb n="375" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">371</mw>
<lb />fully timed my introduction?  But though you have
	    <lb />done me this honour with <persName>Mr</persName>. and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, I
<lb />must not yet, I presume, entreat you to extend it to a
<lb />certain happy gentleman of this company,</q> glancing
<lb />his eyes towards <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE280">No, Sir,</q> answered she with quickness, <q id="CE281">yet, nor
<lb />ever!</q></p>
<p><lb />They were now at the door leading down stairs to
	  <lb />the tea-room<sic corr=".">,</sic>  <persName>Cecilia</persName> saw that <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who had
<lb />hitherto been engaged with some gentleman, seemed
<lb />to be seeking her:  and the remembrance of the
<lb />quarrel which had followed her refusal of his assis&shy;
<lb />tance at the Opera-house, obliged her to determine,
<lb />should he offer it again, to accept it:  but the same
<lb />brutality which forced this intention, contributed to
<lb />render it repugnant to her, and she resolved if possible
<lb />to avoid him, by hurrying down stairs before he
<lb />reached her.  She made, therefore, a sudden attempt
<lb />to slip through the crowd, and as she was light and
<lb />active, she easily succeeded; but though her hasty
	  <lb />motion separated her from the rest of her party, <persName>Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>, who was earnestly looking at her, to discover
<lb />her meaning in the disclaiming speech she made about
	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, saw into her design, but suffered her not
<lb />to go alone; he contrived in a moment to follow and
<lb />join her, while she was stopping at the foot of the stairs
<lb />for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO51">Why what a little thief you are,</q> cried he, <q id="MO52">to
	    <lb />run away from us thus! what do you think <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
<lb />will say?  I saw him looking for you at the very in&shy;
<lb />stant of your flight.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE282">Then you saw at the same time,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q id="CE283">the reason of it.</q>
<pb n="376" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3A2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">372</mw></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO53">Will you give me leave,</q> cried he, laughing, <q id="MO54">to
	    <lb />repeat this to my <persName>Lord Ernolf</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE284">You may repeat it, Sir, if you please,</q> said Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, piqued that he had not rather thought of him&shy;
	  <lb />self than of <persName>Lord Ernolf</persName>, <q id="CE285">to the whole Pantheon.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO55">And if I should,</q> cried he, <q id="MO56">half of it at least,
<lb />would thank me; and to obtain the applause of so
<lb />noble an assembly, what would it signify that Sir
<lb />Robert should cut my throat?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE286">I believe,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, deeply mortified by a
<lb />raillery that shewed so little interest in her avowal of
<lb />indifference, <q id="CE287">you are determined to make me as sick
<lb />of that man's name, as I am of his conversation.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="MO57">And is it possible,</q> exclaimed <persName>Delvile</persName>, in a tone
<lb />of surprise, <q id="MO58">that such can be your opinion, and yet,
<lb />situated as you are, the whole world at your command,
<lb />and all mankind at your devotion&mdash;&mdash;but I am an&shy;
<lb />swering you seriously, when you are only speaking
<lb />by rule.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What rule, Sir?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That which young ladies, upon certain occasions,
<lb />always prescribe themselves.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here they were interrupted by the arrival of the
<lb />rest of the company:  though not before <persName>Cecilia</persName> had
<lb />received some little consolation for her displeasure,
<lb />by finding that young <persName>Delvile</persName> still supposed she was
<lb />engaged, and flattering herself his language would be
<lb />different were he informed of the contrary.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Morrice</persName> now undertook to procure them a table for
<lb />tea, which, as the room was very full, was not easily
	  <lb />done; and while they were waiting his success, <persName>Miss

<lb />came running up to her, and taking her hand, called

<lb />out, <q>Lord, my dear creature, who'd have thought of

<lb />it's so extreme long since I've seen you.  But of all

	      <lb />land's</persName> last assembly?  I thought of asking <persName>Mrs.

<p><lb /><q id="CE288">You are very obliging,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, laughing,
<lb /><q id="CE289">but I hope, since you so often forgot it, the disap&shy;
<lb />pointment did not much lessen your entertainment.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O Lord, no!  I was never so happy in my life.
<lb />There was such a crowd, you could not move a finger.
<lb />Every body in the world was there.  You've no idea
<lb />how delightful it was.  I thought verily I should have
<lb />fainted with the heat.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That was delightful indeed!  And how long did
<lb />you stay?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why we danced till three in the morning.  We
	    <lb />began with <name>Cotillons</name>, and finished with country
<lb />dances.  It was the most elegant thing you ever saw
<lb />in your life; every thing quite in a style.  I was so
<lb />monstrously fatigued, I could hardly get through the
<lb />last dance.  I really thought I should have dropt
<lb />down dead.  Only conceive dancing five hours in
<lb />such a monstrous crowd!  I assure you when I got
<lb />home my feet were all blisters.  You have no idea
<lb />how they smarted.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO59">And whence comes it,</q> cried young <persName>Delvile</persName>, <q id="MO60">that
<lb /><emph>you</emph> partake so little of these delights?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE290">Because I fear,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE291">I came too
<lb />late into the school of fashion to be a ductile pupil.</q>

<p>	  <lb /><q id="LA1">Do you know,</q> continued <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q id="LA2"><persName>Mr.
<lb />Meadows</persName> has not spoke one word to me all the
<lb />evening?  though I am sure he saw me, for I sat at
<lb />the outside on purpose to speak to a person or two,
<lb />that I knew would be strolling about; for if one
<lb />sits on the inside, there's no speaking to a creature you
<lb />know; so I never do it at the Opera, nor in the boxes
<lb />at Ranelagh, nor any where.  It's the shockingest
<lb />thing you can conceive to be made sit in the middle
<lb />of those forms; one might as well be at home, for
<lb />nobody can speak to one.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE292">But you don't seem to have had much better
<lb />success,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE293">in keeping at the outside.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O yes I have, for I got a little chat with two or
<lb />three people as they were passing, for, you know,
<lb />when one sits there, they can't help saying something;
<lb />though I assure you all the men are so excessively
<lb />odd, they don't care whether they speak to one or no.
	    <lb />As to <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, he's really enough to provoke
<lb />one to death.  I suppose he's in one of his absent
<lb />fits.  However, I assure you, I think its extreme im&shy;
	    <lb />pertinent of him, and so I shall tell <persName>Mr. Sawyer</persName>,
<lb />for I know he'll make a point of telling him of it
<lb />again.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE294">I rather think,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE295">the best would be
<lb />to return the compliment in kind, and when he next
<lb />recollects you, appear to have forgotten him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O Lord, that's a very good notion! so I will,
<lb />I declare.  But you can't conceive how glad I am
<lb />the Concert's over; for I assure you, though I sat as
<lb />near the fire as possible, I was so extreme cold you've
	    <lb />no idea, for <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> never would let me have
<lb />the least peep at it.  I declare I believe he does it
<pb n="379" />

<lb />on purpose to plague one, for he grows worse and

<lb />I begin to think she'll never have another.  I wish
<lb />she was to have an execution in her house, if it was
<lb />only to get rid of it!  I am so fatigued with the sight
<lb />of it you can't conceive.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Morrice</persName> now brought intelligence that he had
<lb />secured one side of a table which would very well
<lb />accommodate the ladies; and that the other side was
<lb />only occupied by one gentleman, who, as he was not
<lb />drinking tea himself, would doubtless give up his place
<lb />when the party appeared.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Miss Larolles</persName> then ran back to her own set, and
	  <lb />the rest followed <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Mears</persName>, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> took their places.  The gentleman
	  <lb />opposite to them proved to be <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>:  <persName>Mor&shy;
<lb />rice</persName>, therefore, was much deceived in his expectations,
<lb />for, far from giving up his place, he had flung him&shy;
<lb />self all along upon the form in such a lounging posture,
<lb />while he rested one arm upon the table, that, not
<lb />contented with merely keeping his own seat, he filled
<lb />up a space meant for three.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had already walked off to another
	  <lb />party:  <persName>Delvile</persName> stood aloof for some minutes, expect&shy;
<lb />ing <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> would station himself behind
	  <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>; but <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who would scarce have
<lb />thought such a condescension due to a princess, dis&shy;
<lb />dained any appearance of assiduity, even while he
<pb n="380" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3A4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">376</mw>
<lb />made it his care to publish his pretensions; and there&shy;
<lb />fore, finding no accommodation to please him, he
<lb />stalked towards some gentlemen in another part of
	  <lb />the room.  <persName>Delvile</persName> then took the post he had neglected,
<lb />and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who had not had courage to make
<lb />any effort in his own favour, modestly stood near him.
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> contrived to make room for <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> next
<lb />to herself, and <persName>Morrice</persName> was sufficiently happy in being
<lb />allowed to call the waiters, superintend the provisions,
<lb />and serve the whole party.</p>
<p><lb />The task of making tea fell upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who being
<lb />somewhat incommoded by the vicinity of her neigh&shy;
	  <lb />bours, <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> called out to <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, <q>Do
<lb />pray, Sir, be so good as to make room for one of us at
<lb />your side.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, who was indolently picking his teeth,
<lb />and examining them a tooth pick case glass, did
<lb />not, at first, seem to hear her; and when she repeated
<lb />her request, he only looked at her, and said <q>umph?</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="MR1">Now really, <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>,</q> said she, <q id="MR2">when
<lb />you see any ladies in such distress, I wonder how you
<lb />can forbear helping them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="ME9">In distress, are you?</q> cried he, with a vacant
<lb />smile, <q id="ME10">pray what's the matter?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Don't you see? we are so crouded we can hardly
<lb />sit.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="ME11">Can't you?</q> cried he, <q id="ME12">upon my honour it's very
<lb />shameful that these people don't contrive some seats
<lb />more convenient.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="MR3">Yes,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName>; <q id="MR4">but if you would be so
<lb />kind as to let somebody else sit by you, we should not
<lb />want any contrivance.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />Here <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> was seized with a furious fit of
<pb n="381" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3Br" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">377</mw>
	  <lb />yawning, which as much diverted <persName>Cecilia</persName> and <persName>Mr.
	    <lb />Gosport</persName>, as it offended <persName>Mrs. Mears</persName>, who with great
	  <lb />displeasure added, <q>Indeed, <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, it's very
<lb />strange that you never hear what's said to you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="ME13">I beg your pardon,</q> said he, <q id="ME14">were you speaking
<lb />to me?</q> and again began picking his teeth.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Morrice</persName>, eager to contrast his civility with the in&shy;
<lb />attention of Mr. Meadows, now flew round to the
<lb />other side of the table, and calling out <q>let <emph>me</emph> help
<lb />you, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I can make tea better than any
	    <lb />body,</q> he leant over that part of the form which <persName>Mr.
<lb />Meadows</persName> had occupied with one of his feet, in order
	  <lb />to pour it out himself:  but <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, by an un&shy;
<lb />fortunate removal of his foot, bringing him forwarder
<lb />than he was prepared to go, the tea-pot and its
<lb />contents were overturned immediately opposite to
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Young <persName>Delvile</persName>, who saw the impending evil, from
<lb />an impetuous impulse to prevent her suffering by it,
<lb />hastily drew her back, and bending down before her,
<lb />secured her preservation by receiving himself the mis&shy;
<lb />chief with which she was threatened.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Mrs. Mears</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> vacated their seats in
<lb />a moment, and <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> assisted
<lb />in clearing the table, and removing <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was
<lb />very slightly hurt, and at once surprised, ashamed,
<lb />and pleased at the manner in which she had been
<lb />saved.</p>
<p>	  <lb />Young <persName>Delvile</persName>, though a sufferer from his gallantry,
<lb />the hot water having penetrated through his coat to
<lb />his arm and shoulder, was at first insensible to his
<lb />situation, from an apprehension that <persName>Cecilia</persName> had
<lb />not wholly escaped; and his enquiries were so eager and
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">Vol.&blank;II.&blank;16.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">3B</mw>
<pb n="382" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3Bv" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">378</mw>
<lb />so anxious, made with a look of such solicitude, and
<lb />a voice of such alarm, that, equally astonished and
<lb />gratified, she secretly blest the accident which had
<lb />given birth to his uneasiness, however she grieved for
<lb />its consequence to himself.</p>
<p><lb />But no sooner was he satisfied of her safety, than he
<lb />felt himself obliged to retire; yet attributing to in&shy;
<lb />convenience what was really the effect of pain, he
<lb />hurried away with an appearance of sport, saying,
<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">There is something, I must own, rather <emph>unknightly</emph>
<lb />in quitting the field for a wet jacket, but the company,
	    <lb />I hope, will only give me credit for flying away to <placeName>Ranelagh</placeName>.    So,

<l>Like a brave general after being beat,</l>

<p>	  <lb />He then hastened to his carriage:  and poor <persName>Mor&shy;
<lb />rice</persName>, frightened and confounded at the disaster he had
<lb />occasioned, sneaked after him with much less ceremony.
	  <lb />While <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, wholly unconcerned by the dis&shy;
<lb />tress and confusion around him, sat quietly picking
<lb />his teeth, and looking on during the whole transaction,
<lb />with an unmeaning stare, that made it doubtful
<lb />whether he had even perceived it.</p>
<p><lb />Order being now soon restored, the ladies finished
<lb />their tea, and went up stairs.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whom the
<lb />late accident had afforded much new and interesting
<lb />matter for reflection, wished immediately to have
<lb />returned home, but she was not the leader of the party,
<lb />and therefore could not make the proposal.</p>
<p><lb />They then strolled through all the apartments, and
<lb />having walked about till the fashionable time of
<pb n="383" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3B2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">379</mw>
<lb />retiring, they were joined by <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, and
<lb />proceeded to the little room near the entrance to the
<lb />great one, in order to wait for their carriages.</p>
<p><lb />Here <persName>Cecilia</persName> again met <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, who came
<lb />to make various remarks, and infinite ridicule, upon
<lb />sundry unfashionable or uncostly articles in the
<lb />dresses of the surrounding company; as well as to
	  <lb />complain, with no little resentment, that <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>
<lb />was again standing before the fire!</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Captain Aresby</persName> also advanced to tell her he was
<lb />quite <foreign lang="fre">abattu</foreign> by having so long lost sight of her, to
<lb />hope she <emph>would make a renounce</emph> of mortifying the
<lb />world by discarding it, and to protest he had waited
<lb />for his carriage till he was actually upon the point of
<lb />being <foreign lang="fre">accabl&eacute;</foreign>.</p>
<p><lb />In the midst of this <foreign lang="fre">jargon</foreign>, to which the fulness of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>'s mind hardly permitted her to listen, there
	  <lb />suddenly appeared at the door of the apartment, <persName>Mr.
<lb />Albany</persName>, who with his usual austerity of countenance,
<lb />stopt to look round upon the company.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="GO15">Do you see,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName> to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="GO16">who
<lb />approaches? your poor <foreign lang="fre">sycophants</foreign> will again be
<lb />taken to task, and I, for one, tremble at the coming
<lb />storm!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="LA5">O Lord,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q id="LA6">I wish I was
<lb />safe in my chair! that man always frightens me out
<lb />of my senses.  You've no notion what disagreeable
<lb />things he says to one.  I assure you I've no doubt
<lb />but he's crazy:  and I am always in the shockingest
<lb />fright in the world for fear he should be taken with
<lb />a fit while I'm near him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CA1">It is really a petrifying thing,</q> said the Captain,
<lb /><q id="CA2">that one can go to no <foreign lang="fre">spectacle</foreign> without the <foreign lang="fre">horreur</foreign>
<pb n="384" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3B2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">380</mw>
<lb />of being <foreign lang="fre">obsed&eacute;</foreign> by that person! if he comes this way,
<lb />I shall certainly make a renounce, and retire.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="FL5">Why so!</q> said <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <q id="FL6">what the d&mdash;&mdash;l do
<lb />you mind him for?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CA3">O he is the greatest bore in nature!</q> cried the
<lb />Captain, <q id="CA4">and I always do <foreign lang="fre">mon possible</foreign> to avoid him;
<lb />for he breaks out into such barbarous phrases, that I
<lb />find myself <foreign lang="fre">degout&eacute;</foreign> with him in a moment.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="LA7">O, I assure you,</q> said <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q id="LA8">he attacks
<lb />one sometimes in a manner you've no idea.  One day
<lb />he came up to me all of a sudden, and asked me what
<lb />good I thought I did by dressing so much?  Only con&shy;
<lb />ceive how shocking!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CA5">O, I have had the <foreign lang="fre">horreur</foreign> of questions of that
<lb />sort from him <foreign lang="fre">sans fin</foreign>,</q> said the Captain.  <q id="CA6">Once he
<lb />took the liberty to ask me, what service I was of to
<lb />the world? and another time, he desired me to inform
<lb />him whether I had ever made any poor person pray
<lb />for me?  And, in short, he has so frequently incon&shy;
<lb />venienced me by his impertinences, that he really
<lb />bores me to a degree.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="FL7">That's just the thing that makes him hunt you
	    <lb />down,</q> said <persName>Sir Robert</persName>:  <q id="FL8">if he were to ask me ques&shy;
<lb />tions for a month together, I should never trouble
<lb />myself to move a muscle.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="GO17">The matter of his discourse,</q> said <persName>Mr. Gosport</persName>,
<lb /><q id="GO18">is not more singular than the manner; for without
<lb />any seeming effort or consciousness, he runs into blank
<lb />verse perpetually.  I have made much enquiry about
<lb />him, but all I am able to learn, is, that he was cer&shy;
<lb />tainly confined, at one part of his life, in a private
<lb />mad-house:  and though now, from not being mis&shy;
<lb />chievous, he is set at liberty, his looks, language, and
<pb n="385" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3B3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">381</mw>
<lb />whole behaviour, announce the former injury of his
<lb />intellects.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="LA9">O Lord,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, half screaming,
<lb /><q id="LA10">what shocking notions you put in one's head!  I
<lb />declare I dare say I sha'n't get safe home for him,
<lb />for I as<sic corr="s"></sic>ure you I believe he has taken a spite to me!
<lb />and all because one day, before I knew of his odd
<lb />ways, I happened to fall a laughing at his going about
<lb />in that old coat.  Do you know it put him quite in a
<lb />passion! only conceive how ill natured!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CA7">O he has distressed me,</q> exclaimed the Captain,
<lb />with a shrug, <q id="CA8"><foreign lang="fre">partout!</foreign> and found so much fault with
<lb />every thing I have done, that I should really be glad
<lb />to have the honour to cut; for the moment he comes
<lb />up to me, I know what I have to expect!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="LA11">But I must tell you,</q> cried <persName>Miss Larolles</persName>, <q id="LA12">how
<lb />monstrously he put me in a fright one evening when
	    <lb />I was talking with <persName>Miss Moffat</persName>.  Do you know, he
<lb />came up to us, and asked what we were saying! and
<lb />because we could not think in a minute of something
<lb />to answer him, he said he supposed we were only
<lb />talking some scandal, and so we had better go home,
<lb />and employ ourselves in working for the poor! only
<lb />think how horrid! and after that, he was so excessive
<lb />impertinent in his remarks there was quite no bearing
<lb />him.  I assure you he cut me up so you've no
<lb />notion.</q></p>
<p>	  <lb />Here <persName>Mr. Albany</persName> advanced; and every body but
	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName> moved out of the way.</p>
<p><lb />Fixing his eyes upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with an expression
<lb /><emph>more in sorrow than in anger</emph>, after contemplating
<lb />her some time in silence, he exclaimed, <q>Ah lovely,
<lb />but perishable flower! how long will that ingenuous

<milestone unit="sig" n="3B3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">382</mw>
<lb />countenance, wearing, because wanting no disguise,
<lb />look responsive of the whiteness of the region within!
<lb />How long will that air of innocence irradiate your
<lb />whole appearance? unspoilt by prosperity, unper&shy;
<lb />verted by power! pure in the midst of surrounding
<lb />depravity! unsullied in the tainted air of infectious
<lb />perdition!</q></p>
<p><lb />The confusion of <persName>Cecilia</persName> at this public address,
<lb />which drew upon her the eyes and attention of all the
<lb />company, was inexpressible; she arose from her seat,
<lb />covered with blushes, and saying, <q>I fancy the
<lb />carriage must be ready,</q> pressed forward to quit the
	  <lb />room, followed by <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who answered, <q>No
	    <lb />no, they'll call it when it comes up.  <persName>Arnott</persName>, will you
<lb />go and see where it is?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> stopt, but whispered <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to stand
<lb />near her.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><q id="AL1">And whither,</q> cried <persName>Albany</persName> indignantly, <q id="AL2">whi&shy;
<lb />ther wouldst thou go?  Art thou already disdainful
<lb />of my precepts? and canst thou not one short moment
<lb />spare from the tumult<sic corr="u"></sic>ous folly which encircles thee?
<lb />Many and many are the hours thou mayst spend with
<lb />such as these; the world, alas! is full of them; weary
<lb />not then, so soon, of an old man that would admonish
<lb />thee,&mdash;he cannot call upon thee long, for soon he will
<lb />be called upon himself.</q></p>
<p><lb />This solemn exhortation extremely distressed her;
<lb />and fearing to still further offend him by making
<lb />another effort to escape, she answered in a low voice,
<lb /><q>I will nor only hear, but thank you for your precepts,
<lb />if you will forbear to give them before so many
<lb />witnesses.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="AL3">Whence,</q> cried he sternly, <q id="AL4">these vain and
<pb n="387" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="3B4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">383</mw>
<lb />superficial distinctions?  Do you not dance in public?
<lb />What renders you more conspicuous?  Do you not
<lb />dress to be admired, and walk to be observed?  Why
<lb />then this fantastical scruple, unjustified by reason, un&shy;
<lb />supported by analogy?  Is folly only to be published?
<lb />Is vanity alone to be exhibited?  Oh slaves of sense&shy;
<lb />less contraction!  Oh feeble followers of yet feebler
<lb />prejudice! daring to be wicked, yet fearing to be
<lb />wise; dauntless in levity, yet shrinking from the name
<lb />of virtue!</q></p>
<p><lb />The latter part of this speech, during which he
<lb />turned with energy to the whole company, raised such
<lb />a general alarm, that all the ladies hastily quitted
<lb />the room, and all the gentlemen endeavoured to enter
<lb />it, equally curious to see the man who made the
<lb />oration, and the lady to whom it was addressed.  Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, therefore, found her situation insupportable;
<lb /><q id="CE296">I must go,</q> she cried, <q id="CE297">whether there is a carriage
<lb />or not!  Pray, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, let us go!</q></p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName> then offered to take her hand, which she
<lb />was extremely ready to give him; but while the
	  <lb />crowd made their passage difficult, <persName>Albany</persName>, following
<lb />and stopping her, said, <q>What is it you fear? a
<lb />miserable old man, worn out by the sorrows of that
<lb />experience from which he offers you counsel?  What,
<lb />too, is it you trust! a libertine wretch, coveting no&shy;
<lb />thing but your wealth, for the gift of which he will
<lb />repay you by the perversion of your principles!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What the d&mdash;&mdash;l do you mean by that?</q> cried
<lb />the Baronet.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="AL5">To shew,</q> answered he, austerely, <q id="AL6">the incon&shy;

<p><lb />He then quitted her, every body making way as
	  <lb />he moved, and proceeded into the great room.  <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel's</persName> carriage being also announced at the
<lb />same time, <persName>Cecilia</persName> lost not an instant in hastening
<lb />away.</p>
<p>	  <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, as he conducted her, disdainfully
<lb />laughed at the adventure, which the general licence
	  <lb />allowed to <persName>Mr. Albany</persName> prevented his resenting,
<lb />and which therefore he scorned to appear moved
<lb />at.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> could talk of nothing else, neither was
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> disposed to change the subject, for the remains
<lb />of insanity which seemed to hang upon him, were af&shy;
<lb />fecting without being alarming, and her desire to know
<lb />more of him grew every instant stronger.</p>
<p><lb />This desire, however, outlived not the conversation
<lb />to which it gave rise; when she returned to her
<lb />own room, no vestige of it remained upon her mind,
<lb />which a nearer concern and deeper interest wholly
<lb />occupied.</p>

<p>
<lb />The behaviour of young <persName>Delvile</persName> had pained,
<lb />pleased, and disturbed her.  His activity to save her
<lb />from mischief might proceed merely from gallantry or
<lb />good nature; upon that, therefore, she dwelt little:
<lb />but his eagerness, his anxiety, his insensibility to him&shy;
<lb />self, were more than good breeding could claim, and
<lb />seemed to spring from a motive less artificial.</p>
<p><lb />She now, therefore, believed that her partiality
<lb />was returned; and this belief had power to shake all
<lb />her resolves, and enfeeble all her objections.  The
<lb />arrogance of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> lessened in her reflections,
<lb />the admonitions of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> abated in their in&shy;
<lb />fluence.  With the first she considered that though
<lb />connected she need not live; and for the second,
<lb />though she acknowledged the excellence of his judg&shy;
<lb />ment, she concluded him wholly ignorant of her sen&shy;
	  <lb />timents of <persName>Delvile</persName>; which she imagined, when once
<lb />revealed, would make every obstacle to the alliance
<lb />seem trifling, when put in competition with mutual
<lb />esteem and affection.</p>

	    <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">The</hi> attention of <persName>Cecilia</persName> to her own affairs, did not
<lb />make her forgetful of those of the <name>Harrels</name>:  and the
<lb />morning after the busy day which was last recorded,
<lb />as soon as she quitted the breakfast-room, she began
<lb />a note to <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, but was interrupted with
<lb />information that he was already in the house.</p>
<p><lb />She went to him immediately, and had the satis&shy;
<lb />faction of finding him alone; but desirous as she was
<lb />to relate to him the transactions of the preceding day,
<lb />there was in his countenance a gravity so unusual,
<lb />that her impatience was involuntarily checked, and
<lb />she waited first to hear if he had himself any thing to
<lb />communicate.</p>
<p>	    <lb />He kept her not long in suspence; <q><persName>Miss Bever&shy;
<lb />ley</persName>,</q> he said, <q>I bring you intelligence, which though
<lb />I know you will be very sorry to hear, it is absolutely
<lb />necessary should be told you immediately; you may
<lb />otherwise, from other laudable motives, be drawn into
<lb />some action which you may repent for life.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What now!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much alarmed.</p>
<p><lb /><q>All that I suspected,</q> said he, <q>and more than I
<lb />hinted to you, is true; <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> is a ruined man!
<lb />he is not worth a groat, and he is in debt beyond what
<lb />he ever possessed.</q></p>

<p>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> made no answer:  she knew but too fatally
<lb />the desperate state of his affairs, yet that <emph>his debts
<lb />were more than he had ever possessed</emph> she had not
<lb />thought possible.</p>
<p><lb /><q>My enquiries,</q> continued he, <q>have been among
<lb />principals, and such as would not dare deceive me.  I
<lb />hastened, therefore, to you, that this timely notice
<lb />might enforce the injunctions I gave you when I had
<lb />the pleasure of seeing you last, and prevent a mis&shy;
<lb />judging generosity from leading you into any injury
<lb />of your own fortune, for a man who is past all relief
<lb />from it, and who cannot be saved, even though you
<lb />were to be destroyed for his sake.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are very good,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>but your
<lb />counsel is too late!</q>  She then briefly acquainted
<lb />him with what passed, and with how large a sum she
<lb />had parted.</p>
<p><lb />He heard her with rage, amazement, and horror,
<lb />and after inveighing against <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> in the bitterest
<lb />terms, he said <q>But why, before you signed your
<lb />name to so base an imposition, could you not send for
<lb />me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I wished, I meant to have done it,</q> cried she,
<lb /><q>but I thought the time past when you could help me.
<lb />How, indeed, could you have saved me? my word
<lb />was given, given with an oath the most solemn, and
<lb />the first I have ever taken in my life.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>An oath so forced,</q> answered he, <q>the most deli&shy;
<lb />cate conscience would have absolved you from per&shy;
<lb />forming.  You have, indeed, been grossly imposed
<lb />upon; and pardon me if I add, unaccountably to
<lb />blame.  Was it not obvious that relief so circum&shy;
<lb />stanced must be temporary?  If his ruin had been any
<pb n="393" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="A3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">5</mw>
<lb />thing less than certain, what tradesman would have
<lb />been so insolent?  You have therefore deprived your&shy;
<lb />self of the power of doing good to a worthier object,
<lb />merely to grant a longer date to extravagance and
<lb />villainy.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yet how,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, deeply touched by this
<lb />reproof, <q>how could I do otherwise?  Could I see a
<lb />man in the agonies of despair, hear him first darkly
<lb />hint his own destruction, and afterwards behold him
<lb />almost in the very act of suicide, the instrument of
<lb />self-murder in his desperate hand&mdash;and yet, though he
<lb />put his life in my power, though he told me I could
<lb />preserve him, and he told me he had no other reliance
<lb />or resource, could I leave him to his dreadful despon&shy;
<lb />dence, refuse my assisting hand to raise him from
<lb />perdition, and, to save what, after all, I am well
<lb />able to spare, suffer a fellow-creature, who flung
<lb />himself upon my mercy, to offer up his last accounts
<lb />with an action blacker than any which had preceded
<lb />it?&mdash;No, I cannot repent what I have done, though
<lb />I lament, indeed, that the object was not more de&shy;
<lb />serving.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Your representations,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, <q>like
<lb />every thing else that I ever heard you utter, breathes
<lb />nothing but benevolence and goodness:  but your pity
<lb />has been abused, and your understanding imposed
<lb />upon.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had no intention to destroy him&shy;
<lb />self:  the whole was an infamous trick, which, had
<lb />not your generosity been too well known, would never
<lb />have been played.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I cannot think quite so ill of him,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>nor for the world would I have risked my own future
<lb />reproaches by trusting to such a suspicion, which, had
<pb n="394" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="A3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">6</mw>
<lb />it proved wrong, and had <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, upon my
<lb />refusal, committed the fatal deed, would have made
<lb />his murder upon my own conscience rest for ever!
<lb />Surely the experiment would have been too hazar&shy;
<lb />dous, when the consequence had all my future peace
<lb />in its power.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It is impossible not to rever your scruples,</q> said
	    <lb /><persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Monckton</persName>, <q>even while I consider them as cause&shy;
<lb />less; for causeless they undoubtedly were:  the man
<lb />who could act so atrocious a part, who could so scan&shy;
<lb />dalously pillage a young lady who was his guest and
<lb />his ward, take advantage of his temper for the plunder
<lb />of her fortune, and extort her compliance by the
<lb />basest and most dishonourable arts, meant only to
<lb />terrify her into a compliance; for he can be nothing
<lb />less than a downright and thorough scoundrel, capable
<lb />of every species of mean villainy.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then protested he would at least acquaint her
<lb />other guardians with what had passed, whose business
<lb />it would be to enquire if there was any chance of
<lb />redress<sic corr=".">,</sic>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, had not much trouble in combating
<lb />this proposal; for though her objections, which were
<lb />merely those of punctilious honour and delicacy,
<lb />weighed nothing with a man who regarded them as
<lb />absurdities, yet his own apprehensions of appearing
<lb />too officious in her affairs, forced him, after a little
<lb />deliberation, to give up the design.</p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">Besides,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>as I have his bond for
<lb />what I have parted with, I have, at least, no right to
<lb />complain, unless, after he receives his rents, he
<lb />refuses to pay me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>His bonds! his rents!</q> exclaimed <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>;
<pb n="395" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="A4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">7</mw>
<lb /><q>what is a man's bond who is not worth a guinea?
<lb />and what are his rents, when all he ever owned must
<lb />be sold before they are due, and when he will not
<lb />himself receive a penny from the sale, as he has nei&shy;
<lb />ther land, house, nor possession of any sort that is not
<lb />mortgaged?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nay, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>if so, it is indeed all
<lb />over!  I am sorry, I am grieved!&mdash;but it is past, and
<lb />nothing, therefore, remains, but that I try to forget I
<lb />ever was richer!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>This is very youthful philosophy,</q> said <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>; <q>but it will not lessen your regret here&shy;
<lb />after, when the value of money is better known to
<lb />you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>If I shall dearly buy my experience,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>let me be the more attentive to making good use of
<lb />it; and, since my loss seems irremediable to myself,
<lb />let me at least endeavour to secure its utility to Mr.
<lb />Harrel.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then told him her wish to propose to that
<lb />gentleman some scheme of reformation, while yester&shy;
	    <lb />day's events were yet recent in his mind:  but <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>, who had hardly patience to hear her, ex&shy;
<lb />claimed, <q>He is a wretch, and deserves the full force
<lb />of the disgrace he is courting.  What is now most
<lb />necessary is to guard you from his further machi&shy;
<lb />nations, for you may else be involved in ruin as deep
<lb />as his own.  He now knows the way to frighten you,
<lb />and he will not fail to put it in practice.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>he would vainly
<lb />apply to me in future:  I cannot repent that I ven&shy;
<lb />tured not yesterday to brave his menaces; but too
<lb />little is the comfort I feel from what I have bestowed,
<pb n="396" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="A4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">8</mw>
<lb />to suffer any consideration to make me part with
<lb />more.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Your resolution,</q> answered he, <q>will be as feeble
<lb />as your generosity will be potent:  depend nothing
<lb />upon yourself, but instantly quit his house.  You will
<lb />else be made responsible for every debt that he con&shy;
<lb />tracts; and whatever may be his difficulties hereafter,
<lb />he will know that to extricate himself from them, he
<lb />has but to talk of dying, and to show you a sword or
<lb />a pistol.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>If so, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, looking down while
	    <lb />she spoke, <q>I suppose I must again go to <persName>Mr. Del&shy;
<lb />vile's</persName>.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />This was by no means the purpose of <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<lb />ton</persName>, who saw not more danger to her fortune with one
<lb />of her guardians, than to her person with the other.
<lb />He ventured, therefore, to recommend to her a resi&shy;
<lb />dence with <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, well knowing that his house
<lb />would be a security against her seeing any man equal
<lb />to himself, and hoping that under his roof he might
<lb />again be as unrivalled in her opinion and esteem, as
<lb />he formerly was in the country.</p>
<p><lb />But here the opposition of <persName>Cecilia</persName> was too earnest
<lb />for any hope that it might be surmounted; for, added
<lb />to her dislike of <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, her repugnance to such
<lb />an habitation was strongly, though silently encreased,
	    <lb />by her secret inclinaiton to return to <placeName>St. James's
<lb />Square</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I mention not <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> as an eligible host,</q>
<lb />said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, after listening to her objections,
	    <lb /><q>but merely as one more proper for you than <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, with whom your fixing at present would be
<lb />but ill thought of in the world.</q></p>
<pb n="397" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">9</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>Ill thought of, Sir!  Why so?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Because he has a son; for whose sake alone it
<lb />would be universally concluded you changed your
<lb />abode:  and to give any pretence for such a report,
<lb />would by no means accord with the usual delicacy of
<lb />your conduct.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was confounded by this speech:  the truth
<lb />of the charge she felt, and the probability of the cen&shy;
<lb />sure she did not dare dispute.</p>
<p><lb />He then gave her a thousand exhortations to beware
<lb />of the schemes and artifices of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, which he
<lb />foresaw would be innumerable.  He told her, too,
<lb />that with respect to <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, he thought
<lb />she had better suffer the report to subside of itself,
<lb />which in time it must necessarily do, than give to it so
<lb />much consequence as to send a message to the Baro&shy;
<lb />net, from which he might pretend to infer that hither&shy;
<lb />to she had been wavering, or she would have sent to
<lb />him sooner.</p>
<p><lb />But the real motive of this advice was, that as he
	    <lb />found <persName>Sir Robert</persName> by no means to be dreaded, he hoped
<lb />the report, if generally circulated and credited, might
<lb />keep off other pretenders, and intimidate or deceive
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />The purport for which <persName>Cecilia</persName> had wished this con&shy;
	    <lb />ference was, however, wholly unanswered.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>, enraged by the conduct of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />refused to talk of his affairs, and could only mention
<lb />him with detestation:  but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, less severe in her
<lb />judgment, and more tender in her heart, would not
<lb />yet give up the hope of an amendment she so anxiously
<lb />wished; and having now no other person to whom
	    <lb />she could apply, determined to consult with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName>, whose affection for his sister would give him

<pb n="398" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">10</mw>
<lb />a zeal in the affair that might somewhat supply the
<lb />place of superior abilities.</p>
<p><lb />There was, indeed, no time to be lost in making
<lb />the projected attempt; for no sooner was the imme&shy;
<lb />diate danger of suffering removed, than the alarm
<lb />wore away, and the penitence was forgotten; every
<lb />thing went on as usual, no new regulations were made,
<lb />no expences abated, no pleasures forborne, not a
<lb />thought of hereafter admitted:  and ruinous and ter&shy;
<lb />rible as had been the preceding storm, no trace of it
<lb />was visible in the serenity of the present calm.</p>
<p><lb />An occasion of discussion with <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> very
<lb />speediliy offered.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> said he had observed
<lb />in the looks of his friends at the Pantheon much sur&shy;
<lb />prise at the sight of him, and declared he should take
<lb />yet another measure for removing all suspicion.  This
<lb />was to give a splendid entertainment at his own house
<lb />to all his acquaintance, to which he meant to invite
<lb />every body of any consequence he had ever seen, and
<lb />almost every body he had ever heard of, in his life.</p>
<p><lb />Levity so unfeeling, and a spirit of extravagance so
<lb />irreclaimable, were hopeless prognostics; yet <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />would not desist from her design.  She therefore took
<lb />the earliest opportunity of speaking with <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb />upon the subject, when she openly expressed her
<lb />uneasiness at the state of his brother's affairs, and
<lb />warmly acknowledged her displeasure at his dissipated
<lb />way of life.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> soon shewed that example was all he
<lb />wanted to declare the same sentiments.  He owned
<lb />he had long disapproved the conduct of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />and trembled at the situation of his sister.  They then
<lb />considered what it was possible to propose that might
<lb />retrieve their affairs, and concluded that entirely to
<pb n="399" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">11</mw>
<lb />quit <placeName>London</placeName> for some years, was the only chance
<lb />that remained of saving them from absolute destruc&shy;
<lb />tion.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, therefore, though fearfully, and averse
<lb />to the task, told his sister their mutual advice.  She
<lb />thanked him, said she was much obliged to him, and
<lb />would certainly consider his proposal, and mention
<lb />it to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.&mdash;Parties of pleasure, however, in&shy;
<lb />tervened, and the promise was neglected.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then again spoke herself.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />much softened by her late acts of kindness, was no
<lb />longer offended by her interference, but contented
<lb />herself with confessing that she quite hated the country,
<lb />and could only bear to live in it in summer time.  And
<lb />when Cecila very earnestly expostulated on the weak&shy;
<lb />ness of such an objection to a step absolutely necessary
<lb />for her future safety and happiness, she said, <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">she could
<lb />do no worse than that if already ruined</q>, and therefore
<lb />that she thought <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">it would be very hard to expect from
<lb />her such a sacrifice beforehand.</q>
<lb />It was in vain <persName>Cecilia</persName> remonstrated:  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s
<lb />love of pleasure was stronger than her understanding;
<lb />and therefore, though she listened to her with
<lb />patience, she concluded with the same answer she had
<lb />begun.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, then, though almost heartless, resolved
<lb />upon talking with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> himself:  and therefore,
<lb />taking an opportunity which he had not time to elude,
<lb />she ingenuously told him her opinion of his danger,
<lb />and of the manner in which it might be avoided.</p>
<p><lb />He paid unusual attention to her advice, but said
<lb />she was much mistaken with respect to his affairs,
<lb />which he believed he should now very speedily re&shy;
<lb />trieve, as he had had the preceding night an uncommon
<pb n="400" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">12</mw>
<lb /><emph>run of luck</emph>, and flattered himself with being able very
<lb />shortly to pay all his debts, and begin the world again
<lb />upon a new score.</p>
<p><lb />This open confession of gaming was but a new
<lb />shock to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who scrupled not to represent to
<lb />him the uncertainty of so hazardous a reliance, and
<lb />the inevitable evils of so destructive a practice.</p>
<p><lb />She made not, however, the least impression upon
<lb />his mind; he assured her he doubted not giving her
<lb />shortly a good account of himself, and that living in
<lb />the country was a resource of desperation which need
<lb />not be anticipated.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though grieved and provoked by their
<lb />mutual folly and blindness, could proceed no further:
<lb />advice and admonition she spared not, but authority
<lb />she had none to use.  She regretted her ineffectual
<lb />attempt to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who was yet more cruelly
<lb />afflicted at it; but though they conversed upon the
<lb />subject by every opportunity, they were equally un&shy;
<lb />able to relate any success from their efforts, or to
<lb />devise any plan more likely to ensure it.</p></div>

<lb />waiting upon that gentleman as soon as the ill effects
<lb />of his accident at the Pantheon permitted him to
<lb />leave his own house.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, though just going

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">13</mw>
<lb />terms with his family, and therefore took him up
<lb />stairs to present him to his lady, and invited him to
<lb />tea and cards the next evening.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, did not see him
<lb />without emotion; which was not much lessened by
<lb />the task of thanking him for his assistance at the
<lb />Pantheon, and enquiring how he had himself fared.
<lb />No sign, however, of emotion appeared in return,
<lb />either when he first addressed, or afterwards answered
<lb />her:  the look of solicitude with which she had been
<lb />so much struck when they last parted was no longer
<lb />discernable, and the voice of sensibility which had
<lb />removed all her doubts, was no longer to be heard.
<lb />His general ease and natural gaiety were again
<lb />unruffled; and though he had never seemed really
<lb />indifferent to her, there was not the least appearance
<lb />of any added partiality.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> felt an involuntary mortification as she
<lb />observed this change:  yet, upon reflection, she still
<lb />attributed his whole behaviour to his mistake with
<lb />respect to her situation, and therefore was but the
<lb />more gratified by the preference he occasionally
<lb />betrayed.</p>
<p><lb />The invitation for the next evening was accepted;
<lb />and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, for once, felt no repugnance to joining
	    <lb />the company.  Young <persName>Delvile</persName> again was in excellent
<lb />spirits; but though his chief pleasure was evidently
<lb />derived from conversing with her, she had the vexation
<lb />to observe that he seemed to think her the undoubted
<lb />property of the Baronet, always retreating when he
<lb />approached, and as careful, when next her, to yield his
<lb />place if he advanced, as, when he was distant, to guard
<lb />it from all others.</p>
<p><lb />But when Sir Robert was employed at cards, all
<pb n="402" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">14</mw>
<lb />scruples ceasing, he neglected not to engross her
<lb />almost wholly.  He was eager to speak to her of the
<lb />affairs of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, which he told her wore now
<lb />a better aspect.  The letter, indeed, of recommenda&shy;
<lb />tion which he had shewn to her, had failed, as the
<lb />nobleman to whom it was written had already entered
<lb />into an engagement for his son; but he had made
<lb />application elsewhere, which he believed would be
<lb />successful; and he had communicated his proceedings
<lb />to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, whose spirits he hoped would recover
<lb />by this prospect of employment and advantage.  <q>It
<lb />is, however, but too true,</q> he added, <q>that I have
<lb />rather obtained his consent to the steps I am taking,
<lb />than his approbation of them; nor do I believe, had
<lb />I previously consulted him, I should have had even
<lb />that.  Disappointed in his higher views, his spirit is
<lb />broken, and he is heartless and hopeless, scarce con&shy;
<lb />descending to accept relief, from the bitter remem&shy;
<lb />brance that he expected preferment.  Time, however,
<lb />will blunt this acute sensibility, and reflection will
<lb />make him blush at this unreasonable delicacy.  But
<lb />we must patiently soothe him till he is more himself;
<lb />or while we mean to serve, we shall only torment
<lb />him.  Sickness, sorrow, and poverty have all fallen
<lb />heavily upon him, and they have all fallen at once:
<lb />we must not, therefore, wonder, to find him, intract&shy;
<lb />able, when his mind is as much depressed, as his body
<lb />is enervated.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to whom his candour and generosity always
<lb />gave fresh delight, strengthened his opinions by her
<lb />concurrence, and confirmed his designs by the interest
<lb />which she took in them.</p>
<p><lb />From this time he found almost daily some occasion
	    <lb />for calling in <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>.  The application of
<pb n="403" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">15</mw>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> in favour of <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, gave him a right
<lb />to communicate to her all his proceedings concerning
<lb />him; and he had some letters to shew, some new
<lb />scheme to propose, some refusal to lament, or some
<lb />hope to rejoice over, almost perpetually:  or even
<lb />when these failed, <persName>Cecilia</persName> had a cold, which he came
<lb />to enquire after, or <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> gave him an invi&shy;
<lb />tation, which rendered any excuse unnecessary.  But
<lb />though his intimacy with <persName>Cecilia</persName> was encreased,
<lb />though his admiration of her was conspicuous, and his
<lb />fondness for her society seemed to grow with the
<lb />enjoyment of it, he yet never manifested any doubt of
<lb />her engagement with the Baronet, nor betrayed either
<lb />intention or desire to supplant him.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, however,
<lb />repined not much at the mistake, since she thought
<lb />it might be instrumental to procuring her a more
<lb />impartial acquaintance with his character than she
<lb />could rationally expect, if, as she hoped, the expla&shy;
<lb />nation of his error should make him seek her good
<lb />opinion with more study and design.</p>
<p><lb />To satisfy herself not only concerning the brother
	    <lb />but the sister, she again visited <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, and
<lb />had the pleasure of finding her in better spirits, and
<lb />hearing that the <emph>noble friend</emph> of her brother, whom she
<lb />had already mentioned, and whom <persName>Cecilia</persName> had before
<lb />suspected to be young <persName>Delvile</persName>, had now pointed out
<lb />to him a mehtod of conduct by which his affairs might
<lb />be decently retrieved, and himself creditably em&shy;
	    <lb />ployed.  <persName>Miss Belfie<sic corr="l">f</sic>d</persName> spoke of the plan with the
<lb />highest satisfaction; yet she acknowledged that her
<lb />mother was extremely discontented with it, and that
<lb />her brother himself was rather led by shame than
<lb />inclination to its adoption.  Yet he was evidently
<lb />easier in his mind, though far from happy, and already
<pb n="404" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="B4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">16</mw>
	    <lb />so much better, that <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName> said he would very
<lb />soon be able to leave his room.</p>
<p><lb />Such was the quiet and contented situation of Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, when one evening, which was destined for
<lb />company at home, while she was alone in the drawing
<lb />room, which <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> had just left to answer
<lb />a note, <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> accidentally came up stairs
<lb />before the other gentlemen.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Ha!</q> cried he, the moment he saw her, <q>at last
<lb />have I the good fortune to meet with you alone!
<lb />This, indeed, is a favour I thought I was always to
<lb />be denied.</q></p>
<p><lb />He was then approaching her; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who
<lb />shrunk involuntarily at the sight of him, was retreating
<lb />hastily to quit the room, when suddenly recollecting
<lb />that no better opportunity might ever offer for a final
	    <lb />explanation with him, she irresolutely stopt; and <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName>, immediately following, took her hand and
<lb />pressing it to his lips as she endeavoured to withdraw
<lb />it, exclaimed, <q>You are a most charming creature!</q>
<lb />when the door was opened, and young <persName>Delvile</persName> at the
<lb />same moment was announced and appeared.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, colouring violently, and extremely cha&shy;
<lb />grined, hastily disengaged herself from his hold.  Del&shy;
<lb />vile seemed uncertain whether he ought not to retire,
	    <lb />which <persName>Sir Robert</persName> perceiving, bowed to him with an
<lb />air of mingled triumph and vexation, and said, <q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">Sir,
<lb />your most obedient!</q></p>
<p><lb />The doubt, however, in which every one appeared
<lb />of what was next to be done, was immediately removed
<lb />by the return of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and the arrival at al&shy;
<lb />most the same moment of more company.</p>
<p><lb />The rest of the evening was spent, on the part of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, most painfully:  the explanation she had
<pb n="405" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="C1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">17</mw>
<lb />planned had ended in worse than nothing, for by
<lb />suffering the Baronet to detain her, she had rather
<lb />shewn a disposition to oblige, than any intention to
<lb />discard him; and the situation in which she had been
<lb />surprised by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, was the last to clear
<lb />the suspicions she so little wished him to harbour:
<lb />while, on his part, the accident seemed to occasion no
<lb />other alteration than that of rendering him more than
	    <lb />usually assiduous to give way to <persName>Sir Robert</persName> when&shy;
<lb />ever he approached her.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Nor was <persName>Sir Robert</persName> slack in taking advantage of
<lb />this attention:  he was highly in spirits, talked to her
<lb />with more than common freedom, and wore the whole
<lb />evening an air of exulting satisfaction.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, provoked by this presumption, hurt by the
<lb />behaviour of young <persName>Delvile</persName>, and mortified by the
<lb />whole affair, determined to leave this mistake no
<lb />longer in the power of accident, but to apply immedi&shy;
<lb />ately to <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> senior, and desire him, as her
	    <lb />guardian, to wait upon <persName>Sir Robert</persName> himself, and ac&shy;
<lb />quaint him that his perseverance in pursuing her was
<lb />both useless and offensive:  and by this method she
<lb />hoped at once to disentangle herself for ever from the
<lb />Baronet, and to discover more fully the sentiments
<lb />of young <persName>Delvile</persName>:  for the provocation she had just
<lb />endured, robbed her of all patience for waiting the
<lb />advice of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.</p></div>

<lb />ceremonies of messages and long waiting, she was
	    <lb />shewn into an apartment where she found <persName>Mr. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName> and his son.</p>
<p><lb />She rejoiced to see them together, and determined
<lb />to make known to them both the purport of her visit:
<lb />and therefore, after some apologies and a little hesi&shy;
<lb />tation, she told <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, that encouraged by his
<lb />offers of serving her, she had taken the liberty to call
<lb />upon him with a view to entreat his assistance.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Young <persName>Delvile</persName>, immediately arising, would have
<lb />quitted the room; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, assuring him she
<lb />rather desired what she had to say should be known
<lb />than kept secret, begged that he would not disturb
<lb />himself.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, pleased with this permission to hear her,
<lb />and curious to know what would follow, very readily
<lb />returned to his seat.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I should by no means,</q> she continued, <q>have
<lb />thought of proclaiming even to the most intimate of
<lb />my friends, the partiality which <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>
<lb />has been pleased to shew me, had he left to me the
<lb />choice of publishing or concealing it:  but, on the
<lb />contrary, his own behaviour seems intended not
<lb />merely to display it, but to insinuate that it meets
<lb />with my approbation.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, also, urged by too
<lb />much warmth of friendship, has encouraged this
<lb />belief; nor, indeed, do I know at present where the
<lb />mistake stops, nor what it is report has not scrupled
<lb />to affirm.  But I think I ought no longer to neglect
<lb />it, and therfore I have presumed to solicit your
<lb />advice in what manner I may most effectually con&shy;
<lb />tradict it.</q></p>
<p><lb />The extreme surprise of young <persName>Delvile</persName> at this
<lb />speech was not more evident than pleasant to <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<pb n="407" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="C2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">19</mw>
<lb />in whom it accounted for all that had perplext her in
<lb />his conduct, while it animated every expectation she
<lb />wished to encourage.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>The behaviour of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,</q> answered <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, <q>has by no means been such as to lead me to
	      <lb />forget that his father was the son of a steward of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Grant</persName>, who lived in the neighbourhood of my friend
	      <lb />and relation the Duke of <placeName>Derwent</placeName>:  nor can I suffi&shy;
<lb />ciently congratulate myself that I have always de&shy;
<lb />clined acting with him.  The late Dean, indeed,
<lb />never committed so strange an impropriety as that
<lb />of nominating <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> coad&shy;
<lb />jutors with <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.  The impropriety, however,
<lb />though extremely offensive to me, has never oblite&shy;
<lb />rated from my mind the esteem I bore the Dean:  nor
<lb />can I possibly give a greater proof of it than the
<lb />readiness I have always shewn to offer my counsel and
<lb />instruction to his neice.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, therefore, ought
<lb />certainly to have desired <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> to ac&shy;
<lb />quaint me with his proposals before he gave to him
<lb />any answer.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Undoubtedly, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, willing to shorten
<lb />this parading harangue, <q>but as he neglected that
<lb />attention, will you think me too impertinent should I
	      <lb />entreat the favour of you to speak with <persName>Sir Robert</persName>
<lb />yourself, and explain to him the total inefficacy of
<lb />his pursuit, since my determination against him is un&shy;
<lb />alterable?</q></p>
<p><lb />Here the conference was interrupted by the en&shy;
	    <lb />trance of a servant who said something to <persName>Mr. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>, which occasioned his apologizing to <persName>Cecilia</persName> for
<lb />leaving her for a few moments, and ostentatiously
<lb />assuring her that no business, however important,
<pb n="408" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="C2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">20</mw>
<lb />should prevent his thinking of her affairs, or detain
<lb />him from returning to her as soon as possible.</p>
<p><lb />The astonishment of young <persName>Delvile</persName> at the strength
<lb />of her last expression kept him silent some time after
<lb />his father left the room:  and then, with a countenance
<lb />that still marked his amazement, he said, <q>Is it
<lb />possible, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, that I should twice have been
<lb />thus egregiously deceived; or rather, that the whole
<lb />town, and even the most intimate of your friends,
<lb />should unaccountably have persisted in a mis&shy;
<lb />take.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">For the town,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I know not
<lb />how it can have had any concern in so small a matter;
<lb />but for my intimate friends, I have too few to make
<lb />it probable they should ever have been so strangely
<lb />misinformed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pardon me,</q> cried he, <q>it was from one who
<lb />ought to know, that I had myself the intelligence.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I intreat you, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>to acquaint
<lb />me who it was?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> himself; who communicated it to a
<lb />lady in my hearing, and at a public place.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> cast up her eyes in wonder and indignation
<lb />at a proof so incontrovertable of his falsehood, but
<lb />made not any answer.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Even yet,</q> continued he, <q>I can scarcely feel
<lb />undeceived; your engagement seemed so positive,
<lb />your connection so irretrievable,&mdash;so,&mdash;so <emph>fixed</emph>, I
<lb />mean.&mdash;</q>  He hesitated, a little embarrassed; but
<lb />then suddenly exclaimed, <q>Yet whence, if to <emph>neither</emph>
	      <lb />favourable, if indifferent alike to <persName>Sir Robert</persName> and to
	      <lb /><persName>Belfield</persName>, whence that animated apprehension for their
<lb />safety at the Opera-house? whence that never to be
<pb n="409" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="C3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">21</mw>
<lb />forgotten, <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">Oh stop him! good God! will nobody
<lb />stop him!</q>&mdash;Words of anxiety so tender! and sounds
<lb />that still vibrate in my ear!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, struck with amazement in her turn at the
<lb />strength of her own expressions, blushed, and for a
<lb />few minutes hesitated how to answer him:  but then,
<lb />to leave nothing that related to so disagreeable a
<lb />report in any doubt, she resolved to tell him ingenu&shy;
<lb />ously the circumstances that had occasioned her alarm:
<lb />and therefore, though with some pain to her modesty,
<lb />she confessed her fears that she had herself provoked
<lb />the affront, though her only view had been to dis&shy;
	    <lb />countenance <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, without meaning to shew
<lb />any distinction to <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, who seemed charmed with the candour of
<lb />this explanation, said, when she had finished it,
<lb /><q>You are then at liberty?&mdash;&mdash;Ah madam!&mdash;how
<lb />many may rue so dangerous a discovery!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Could you think,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, endeavouring to
<lb />speak with her usual ease, <q>that <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>
<lb />would be found so irresistible?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Oh no!</q> cried he, <q>far otherwise; a thousand
<lb />times I have wondered at his happiness; a thousand
<lb />times when I have looked at you, and listened to you,
<lb />I have thought it impossible; yet my authority seemed
<lb />indisputable.  And how was I to descredit what was
<lb />not uttered as a conjecture, but asserted as a fact? as&shy;
<lb />serted, too, by the guardian with whom you lived? and
<lb />not hinted as a secret, but affirmed as a point settled?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yet surely,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>you have heard me
<lb />make use of expressions that could not but lead you
<lb />to suppose there was some mistake, whatever might
<lb />be the authority which had won your belief.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No,</q> answered he, <q>I never supposed any mis&shy;
<pb n="410" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="C3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">22</mw>
<lb />take, though sometimes I thought you repented your
<lb />engagement.  I concluded, indeed, you had been un&shy;
<lb />warily drawn in, and I have even, at times, been
<lb />tempted to acknowledge my suspicions to you, state
<lb />your independence, and exhort you&mdash;&mdash;as a <emph>friend</emph>,
<lb />exhort you&mdash;to use it with spirit, and, if you were
<lb />shackled unwillingly, incautiously, or unworthily, to
<lb />break the chains by which you were confined, and re&shy;
<lb />store to yourself that freedom of choice, upon the use
<lb />of which all your happiness must ultimately depend.
<lb />But I doubted if this were honourable to the Baro&shy;
<lb />net;&mdash;and what, indeed, was my right to such a li&shy;
<lb />berty? none that every man <sic corr="">man</sic> might not be proud
<lb />of, a wish to do honour to myself, under the officious
<lb />pretence of serving the most amiable of women.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>has been so strange&shy;
<lb />ly bigotted to his friend, that in his eagerness to ma&shy;
<lb />nifest his regard for him, he seems to have forgotten
<lb />every other consideration; he would not, else, have
<lb />spread so widely a report that could so ill stand en&shy;
<lb />quiry.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>If Sir Robert,</q> returned he, <q>is himself deceived
<lb />while he deceives others, who can forbear to pity
<lb />him? for my own part, instead of repining that hither&shy;
<lb />to I have been mistaken, ought I not rather to bless
<lb />an error that may have been my preservative from
<lb />danger?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, distressed in what manner to support her
<lb />part in the conversation, began now to wish the re&shy;
<lb />turn of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>; and, not knowing what else to
<lb />say, she expressed her surprise at his long absence.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>It is not, indeed, well timed,</q> said young <persName>Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>, <q>just now&mdash;at the moment when&mdash;</q> he stopt,
<pb n="411" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="C4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">23</mw>
<lb />and presently exclaiming <q>Oh dangerous interval!</q>
<lb />he arose from his seat in manifest disorder.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> arose too, and hastily ringing the bell, said,
<lb /><q><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> I am sure is detained, and therefore
<lb />I will order my chair, and call another time.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Do I frighten you away?</q> said he, assuming an
<lb />appearance more placid.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No,</q> answered she, <q>but I would not hasten
<lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb />A servant then came, and said the chair was ready<sic corr=".">,</sic></p>
<p><lb />She would immediately have followed him, but
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName> again speaking, she stopt a moment to
<lb />hear him.  <q>I fear,</q> said he, with much hesitation,
<lb /><q>I have strangely exposed myself&mdash;&mdash;and that you
<lb />cannot&mdash;but the extreme astonishment&mdash;</q> he stopt
<lb />again, in the utmost confusion, and then adding <q>you
<lb />will permit me to attend you to the chair,</q> he hand&shy;
<lb />ed her down stairs, and in quitting her, bowed with&shy;
<lb />out saying a word more.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was almost wholly indifferent to every
<lb />part of the explanation but that which had actually
<lb />passed, was now in a state of felicity more delightful
<lb />than any she had ever experienced.  She had not a
<lb />doubt remaining of her influence over the mind of
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName>, and the surprise which had made him
<lb />rather betray than express his regard, was infinitely
<lb />more flattering and satisfactory to her than any for&shy;
<lb />mal or direct declaration.  She had now convinced
<lb />him she was disengaged, and in return, though with&shy;
<lb />out seeming to intend it, he had convinced her of the
<lb />deep interest which he took in the discovery.  His
<lb />perturbation, the words which escaped him, and his
<lb />evident struggle to say no more, were proofs just
<lb />such as she wished to receive of his partial admira&shy;
<pb n="412" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="C4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">24</mw>
<lb />tion, since while they satisfied her heart, they also
<lb />soothed her pride, by showing a diffidence of success
<lb />which assured her that her own secret was still sa&shy;
<lb />cred, and that no weakness or inadvertency on her
<lb />part had robbed her of the power of mingling dignity
<lb />with the frankness with which she meant to receive
<lb />his addresses.  All, therefore, that now employed her
<lb />care, was to keep off any indissoluble engagement till
<lb />each should be better known to the other.</p>
<p><lb />For this reserve, however, she had less immediate
<lb />occasion than she expected; she saw no more of
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName> that day; neither did he appear the
<lb />next.  The third she fully expected him&mdash;but still he
<lb />came not.  And while she wondered at an absence so
<lb />uncommon, she received a note from Lord Ernolf, to
<lb />beg permission to wait upon her for two minutes, at
<lb />any time she would appoint.</p>
<p><lb />She readily sent word that she should be at home
<lb />for the rest of the day, as she wished much for an op&shy;
<lb />portunity of immediately finishing every affair but
<lb />one, and setting her mind at liberty to think only of
<lb />that which she desired should prosper.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Lord Ernolf</persName> was with her in half an hour.  She
<lb />found him sensible and well bred, extremely desirous
<lb />to promote her alliance with his son, and apparently
<lb />as much pleased with herself as with her fortune.
<lb />He acquainted her that he had addressed himself to
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> long since, but had been informed that
<lb />she was actually engaged to <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>:  he
<lb />should, therefore, have forborne taking up any part of
<lb />her time, had he not, the preceding day, while on a
<lb />visit at <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>'s, been assured that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />was mistaken, and that she had not yet declared for
<lb />any body.  He hoped, therefore, that she would al&shy;
<pb n="413" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">25</mw>
<lb />low his son the honour of waiting upon her, and per&shy;
<lb />mit him to talk with <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, who he understood
<lb />was her acting guardian, upon such matters as ought
<lb />to be speedily adjusted.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for the honour he intended her,
<lb />and confirmed the truth of the account he had heard
	    <lb />in <placeName>St. James's Square</placeName>, but at the same time told him
<lb />she must decline receiving any visits from his lord&shy;
<lb />ship's son, and entreated him to take no measure to&shy;
<lb />wards the promotion of an affair which never could
<lb />succeed.</p>
<p><lb />He seemed much concerned at her answer, and
<lb />endeavoured for some time to soften her, but found
<lb />her so steady, though civil in her refusal, that he was
<lb />obliged, however unwillingly, to give up his at&shy;
<lb />tempt.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, when he was gone, reflected with much
	    <lb />vexation on the readiness of the <name>Delviles</name> to en&shy;
<lb />courage his visit; she considered, however, that the
<lb />intelligence he had heard might possibly be gathered
<lb />in general conversation; but she blamed herself that
<lb />she had not led to some enquiry what part of the fa&shy;
<lb />mily he had seen, and who was present when the in&shy;
<lb />formation was given him.</p>
<p><lb />Mean while she found that neither coldness, dis&shy;
	    <lb />tance, nor aversion were sufficient to repress <persName>Sir Ro&shy;
<lb />bert Floyer</persName>, who continued to persecute her with as
<lb />much confidence of success as could have arisen from
<lb />the utmost encouragement.  She again, though with
<lb />much difficulty, contrived to speak with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />upon the subject, and openly accused him of spread&shy;
<lb />ing a report abroad, as well as countenancing an ex&shy;
<lb />pectation at home, that had neither truth nor justice
<lb />to support them.

<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, with his usual levity and carelessness,
<lb />laughed at the charge, but denied any belief in her
<lb />displeasure, and affected to think she was merely
	    <lb />playing the coquet, while <persName>Sir Robert</persName> was not the less
<lb />her decided choice.</p>
<p><lb />Provoked and wearied, <persName>Cecilia</persName> resolved no longer
<lb />to depend upon any body but herself for the manage&shy;
<lb />ment of her own affairs; and therefore, to conclude
<lb />the business without any possibility of further cavil&shy;

<lb />To this note <persName>Cecilia</persName> received no answer:  but she
	    <lb />had the pleasure to observe that <persName>Sir Robert</persName> forbore
<lb />his usual visit on the day she sent it, and, though he
<lb />appeared again the day following, he never spoke to
<lb />her, and seemed sullen and out of humour.</p>
<p><lb />Yet still young <persName>Delvile</persName> came not, and still, as her
<lb />surprise encreased, her tranquillity was diminished.
<lb />She could form no excuse for his delay, nor conjec&shy;
<lb />ture any reason for his absence.  Every motive seemed
<pb n="415" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">27</mw>
<lb />to favour his seeking, and not one his shunning her:
<lb />the explanation which had so lately passed had in&shy;
<lb />formed him he had no rival to fear, and the manner
<lb />in which he had heard it assured her the information
<lb />was not indifferent to him; why, then, so assiduous
<lb />in his visits when he thought her engaged, and so
<lb />slack in all attendance when he knew she was at
<lb />liberty?</p></div>

	    <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">Unable</hi> to relieve herself from this perplexity,
	    <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to divert her chagrin, again visited <persName>Miss
<lb />Belfield</persName>.  She had then the pleasure to hear that her
<lb />brother was much revcovered, and had been able, the
<lb />preceding evening, to take an airing, which he had
	    <lb />borne so well, that <persName>Mr. Rupil</persName> had charged him to use
<lb />the same exercise every morning.</p>
<p><lb />Almost a fortnight had now elapsed since her ex&shy;
<lb />planation with young <persName>Delvile</persName>, yet not once had he
	    <lb />been in <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, though in the fortnight
<lb />which had preceded, scarce a day had passed which
<lb />had not afforded him some pretence for calling there.</p>
<p><lb />At length a note arrived from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.  It
<lb />contained the most flattering reproaches for her long
<lb />absence, and a pressing invitation that she would dine
<lb />and spend the next day with her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had merely denied herself the pleasure
<lb />of this visit from an apprehension of seeming too
<lb />desirous of keeping up the connexion, now from the
<lb />same sense of propriety, determined upon making it,
<pb n="416" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">28</mw>
<lb />wishing equally to avoid all appearance of conscious&shy;
<lb />ness, either by seeking or avoiding the intimacy of the
<lb />family.</p>
<p><lb />Not a little was her anxiety to know in what man&shy;
<lb />ner young <persName>Delvile</persName> would receive her, whether he
<lb />would be grave or gay, agitated, as during their last
<lb />conversation, or easy, as in the meetings which had
<lb />preceded it.</p>
<p><lb />She found <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, however, alone; and ex&shy;
<lb />tremely kind to her, yet much surprised, and half
<lb />displeased, that she had so long been absent.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />though somewhat distressed what excuses to offer,
<lb />was happy to find herself so highly in favour, and not
<lb />very reluctant to promise more frequent visits in
<lb />future.</p>
<p><lb />They were then summoned to dinner; but still no
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName> was visible:  they were joined only by
<lb />his father, and she found that no one else was ex&shy;
<lb />pected.</p>
<p><lb />Her astonishment now was greater than ever,
<lb />and she could account by no possible conjecture
<lb />for a conduct so extraordinary.  Hitherto, when&shy;
	    <lb />ever she had visited in <placeName>St. James's-Square</placeName> by
<lb />appointment, the air with which he had received her,
<lb />constantly announced that he had impatiently waited
<lb />her arrival; he had given up other engagements to
<lb />stay with her, he had openly expressed his hopes that
<lb />she would never be long absent, and seemed to take
<lb />a pleasure in her society to which every other was
<lb />inferior.  And now, how striking the difference! he
<lb />forbore all visits at the house where she resided, he
<lb />even flew from his own when he knew she was ap&shy;
<lb />proaching it!</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now suspected that some engagement was
<pb n="417" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">29</mw>
<lb />in agitation on the part of young <persName>Delvile</persName>, and that
<lb />while she thought him so sedulous only to avoid her,
<lb />he was simply occupied in seeking another.  This
<lb />painful suggestion, which every thing seemed to con&shy;
<lb />firm, again overset all her schemes, and destroyed all
<lb />her visionary happiness.  Yet how to reconcile it
<lb />with what had passed at their last meeting she knew
<lb />not:  she had then every reason to believe that his
<lb />heart was in her power, and that courage, or an op&shy;
<lb />portunity more seasonable, was all he wanted to make
<lb />known his devotion to her? why, then, shun, if he
<lb />loved her? why, if he loved her not, seem so per&shy;
<lb />turbed at the explanation of her independence?</p>
<p><lb />A very little time, however, she hoped would un&shy;
<lb />ravel this mystery; in two days, the entertainment
<lb />which <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had planned, to deceive the world
<lb />by an appearance of affluence to which he had lost all
<lb />title, was to take place; young <persName>Delvile</persName>, in common
<lb />with every other person who had ever been seen at the
<lb />house, had early received an invitation, which he
<lb />had readily promised to accept some time before the
<lb />conversation that seemed the period of their acquaint&shy;
<lb />ance had passed.  Should he, after being so long en&shy;
<lb />gaged, fail to keep his appointment, she could no
<lb />longer have any doubt of the justice of her conjecture;
<lb />should he, on the contrary, again appear, from his
<lb />behaviour and his looks she might perhaps be able to
<lb />gather why he had so long been absent.</p>
<p><lb />The day at length arrived, of which the evening
<lb />and the entrance of the company were, for the first
<lb />time, as eagerly wished by <persName>Cecilia</persName> as by her dissipat&shy;
<lb />ed host and hostess.  No expence and no pains had
<lb />been spared to render this long projected entertain&shy;
<lb />ment splendid and elegant; it was to begin with a
<pb n="418" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">30</mw>
<lb />concert, which was to be followed by a ball, and suc&shy;
<lb />ceeded by a supper.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though unusually anxious about her own
<lb />affairs, was not so engrossed by them as to behold
<lb />with indifference a scene of such unjustifiable extrava&shy;
<lb />gance; it contributed to render her thoughtful and
<lb />uneasy, and deprive her of all mental power of parti&shy;
<lb />cipating in the gaiety of the assembly.  <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb />was yet more deeply affected by the mad folly of the
<lb />scheme, and recived form the whole evening no
<lb />other satisfaction than that which a look of sympa&shy;
<lb />thetic concern from <persName>Cecilia</persName> occasionally afforded him.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Till nine o'clock no company appeared, except <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert Floyer</persName>, who stayed from dinner time, and
<lb /><persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, who, having received an invitation for
<lb />the evening, was so much delighted with the permis&shy;
<lb />sion to again enter the house, that he made use of it
<lb />between six and seven o'clock, and before the family
<lb />had left the dining parlour.  He apologized with the
<lb />utmost humility to <persName>Cecilia</persName> for the unfortunate acci&shy;
<lb />dent at the Pantheon; but as to her it had been pro&shy;
<lb />ductive of nothing but pleasure, by exciting in young
<lb />Delvile the most flattering alarm for her safety, she
<lb />found no great difficulty in according him her pardon.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Among those who came in the first crowd was <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>, who, had he been equally unconscious of
<lb />sinister views, would, in following his own inclination,
<lb />have been as early in his attendance as <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>;
<lb />but who, to obviate all suspiciuos remarks, conform&shy;
<lb />ed to the fashionable tardiness of the times.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>'s chief apprehension for the evening was,
<lb />that <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> would ask her to dance with
<lb />him, which she could not refuse without sitting still
<lb />during the ball, nor accept, after the reports she knew
<pb n="419" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">31</mw>
<lb />to be spread, without seeming to give a public sanc&shy;
<lb />tion to them.  To <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, therefore, inno&shy;
<lb />cently considering him as a married man and her old
<lb />friend, she frankly told her distress, adding, by way
<lb />of excuse for the hint, that the partners were to be
<lb />changed every two dances.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, though his principal study was
<lb />carefully to avoid all public gallantry or assiduity to&shy;
<lb />wards <persName>Cecilia</persName>, had not the forbearance to resist this
<lb />intimation, and, therefore, she had the pleasure of tell&shy;
	    <lb />ing <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, when he asked the honour of her
<lb />hand for the two first dances, that she was already
<lb />engaged.</p>
<p><lb />She then expected that he would immediately se&shy;
<lb />cure her for the two following:  but, to her great joy,
<lb />he was so much piqued by the evident pleasure with
<lb />which she announced her engagement, that he proud&shy;
<lb />ly walked away without adding another word.</p>
<p><lb />Much satisfied with this arrangement, and not
<lb />without hopes that, if she was at liberty when he ar&shy;
<lb />rived, she might be applied to by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, she
<lb />now endeavoured to procure herself a place in the
<lb />music room.</p>
<p><lb />This, with some difficulty, she effected:  but though
<lb />there was an excellent concert, in which several ca&shy;
<lb />pital performers played and sung, she found it impos&shy;
<lb />sible to hear a note, as she chanced to be seated just
	    <lb />by <persName>Miss Leeson</persName>, and two other young ladies, who
<lb />were paying one another compliments upon their
<lb />dress and their looks, settling to dance in the same
<lb />cotillon, guessing who would begin the minuets, and
<lb />wondering there were not more gentlemen.  Yet, in
<lb />the midst of this unmeaning conversation, of which
	    <lb />she remarked that <persName>Miss Leeson</persName> bore the principal
<pb n="420" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="D4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">32</mw>
<lb />part, not one of them failed, from time to time, to
<lb />exclaim with great rapture <q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post(&amp;rdquo;)slant(italic)">What sweet
<lb />music!&mdash;</q>
<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post(&amp;rdquo;)slant(italic)">Oh how charming!</q>
<q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post(&amp;rdquo;)slant(italic)">Did you ever hear any
<lb />thing so delightful?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />Here, in a few minutes, <persName>Mrs. Panton</persName>, a lady who
<lb />frequently visited at the house, approached <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />followed by a gentleman, whom she had never be&shy;
<lb />fore seen, but who was so evidently charmed with
<lb />her, that he had looked at no other object since his
<lb />entrance into the house.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Panton</persName>, presenting him to her by the name of
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, told her he had begged her intercession
<lb />for the honour of her hand in the two first dances:
<lb />and the moment she answered that she was already
<lb />engaged, the same request was made for the two fol&shy;
<lb />lowing.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> had then no excuse, and was, there&shy;
<lb />fore obliged to accept him.</p>
<p><lb />The hope she had entertained in the early part of
<lb />the evening, was already almost wholly extinguished!
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> appeared not! though her eye watched the
<lb />entrance of every new visitor, and her vexation made
<lb />her believe that he alone, of all the town, was absent.</p>
<p><lb />When the concert was over, the company joined
<lb />promiscuously for chat and refreshments before the
<lb />ball; and Lord Ernolf concluding <persName>Cecilia</persName> still dis&shy;
	    <lb />engaged, advanced, and presented to her <persName>Lord Der&shy;
<lb />ford</persName>, his son, a youth not yet of age, soliciting the
<lb />honour of her hand as his partner.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> having a double excuse, easily declined this
 <lb />proposal; <persName>Lord Ernolf</persName>, however, was too earnest to
<lb />be repulsed, and told her he should again try his in&shy;
<lb />terest when her two present engagements were ful&shy;
<lb />filled.  Hopeless, now, of young <persName>Delvile</persName>, she heard
<lb />this intimation with indifference; and the dancing
<pb n="421" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">33</mw>
<lb />beginning at this instant, she hurried, with a beating
<lb />heart, to the place of action, where, as soon as the
<lb />first cotillon was over, she perceived young <persName>Delvile</persName>
<lb />just walking into the room.  Surprise, pleasure, and
<lb />confusion assailed her all at once; she had entirely
<lb />given up her expectation of seeing him, and an ab&shy;
<lb />sence so determined had led her to conclude he had
<lb />pursuits which ought to make her join in wishing it
<lb />lengthened; but now he appeared, that conclusion,
<lb />with the fear that gave rise to it, vanished; and she
<lb />regretted nothing but the unfortunate succession of
<lb />engagements which would prevent her dancing with
<lb />him at all, and probably keep of all conversation with
<lb />him till supper time.</p>
<p><lb />She soon, however, perceived a change in his air
<lb />and behaviour that extremely astonished her:  he
<lb />looked grave and thoughtful, saluted her at a dis&shy;
<lb />tance, shewed no sign of any intention to approach
<lb />her, regarded the dancing and dancers as a public
<lb />spectacle in which he had no chance of personal in&shy;
<lb />terest, and seemed wholly altered, not merely with
<lb />respect to her, but to himself, as his former eager&shy;
<lb />ness for her society was not more abated than his for&shy;
<lb />mer general gaiety.</p>
<p><lb />She had no time, however, for comments, as she
<lb />was presently called to the second cotillon; but the
<lb />confused and unpleasant ideas which, without wait&shy;
<lb />ing for time or reflection, crowded upon her imagina&shy;
<lb />tion on observing his behaviour, were not more de&shy;
	    <lb />pressing to herself, than obvious to her partner; <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>, by the change in her countenance first
<lb />perceived the entrance of young <persName>Delvile</persName>, and by her
<lb />apparent emotion and uneasiness, readily penetrated
<lb />into the state of her mind; he was confirmed that her
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">Vol.&blank;II.&blank;18.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">E</mw>
<pb n="422" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">34</mw>
<lb />affections were engaged; he saw, too, that she was
<lb />doubtful with what return.</p>
<p><lb />The grief with which he made the first discovery,
<lb />was somewhat lessened by the hopes he conceived
<lb />from the second; yet the evening was to him as pain&shy;
<lb />ful as to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, since he now knew that whatever
<lb />prosperity might ultimately attend his address and
<lb />assiduity, her heart was not her own to bestow; and
<lb />that even were he sure of young <persName>Delvile</persName>'s indiffer&shy;
<lb />ence, and actually at liberty to make proposals for
<lb />himself, the time of being first in her esteem was at
<lb />an end, and the long-earned good opinion which he
<lb />had hoped would have ripened into affection, might
<lb />now be wholly undermined by the sudden impression
<lb />of a lively stranger, without trouble to himself, and
<lb />perhaps without pleasure!</p>
<p><lb />Reflections such as these wholly embittered the
<lb />delight he had promised himself from dancing with
<lb />her, and took from all power to combat the anx&shy;
<lb />iety with which she was seized:  when the second co&shy;
<lb />tillon, therefore, was over, instead of following her
<lb />to a seat, or taking the privilege of his present situ&shy;
<lb />ation to converse with her, the jealousy rising in his
<lb />breast robbed him of all satisfaction, and gave to him
<lb />no other desire than to judge its justice by watching
<lb />her motions at a distance.</p>
<p><lb />Mean while <persName>Cecilia</persName>, inattentive whether he accom&shy;
<lb />panied or quitted her, proceeded to the first vacant
<lb />seat.  Young Delvile was standing near it, and in a
<lb />short time, but rather as if he could not avoid than as
<lb />if he wished it, he came to enquire how she did.</p>
<p><lb />The simplest question, in the then situation of her
<lb />mind, was sufficient to confuse her, and though she
<lb />answered, she hardly knew what he asked.  A mi&shy;
<pb n="423" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">35</mw>
<lb />nute<sic corr="">s</sic>'s recollection, however, restored an apparent
<lb />composure, and she talked to him of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />with her usual partial regard for that lady, and with
<lb />an earnest endeavour to seem unconscious of any al&shy;
<lb />teration in his behaviour.</p>
<p><lb />Yet, to him, even this trifling and general conver&shy;
<lb />sation was evidently painful, and he looked relieved
<lb />by the approach of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, who soon after
<lb />joined them.</p>
<p>	    <lb />At this time a young lady who was sitting by <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>, called to a servant who was passing, for a glass
<lb />of lemonade:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> desired he would bring her one
	    <lb />also; but <persName>Delvile</persName>, not sorry to break off the discourse,
<lb />said he would himself be her cup-bearer, and for that
<lb />purpose went away.</p>
<p><lb />A moment after, the servant returned with some
	    <lb />lemonade to <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s neighbour, and <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, tak&shy;
<lb />ing a glass from him, brought it to <persName>Cecilia</persName> at the very
<lb />instant young <persName>Delvile</persName> came with another.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I think I am before-hand with you, Sir,</q> said the
<lb />insolent Baronet.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir,</q> answered young <persName>Delvile</persName>, <q>I think we
<lb />were both in together:  <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, however, is
<lb />steward of the race, and we must submit to her de&shy;
<lb />cision.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Well, madam,</q> cried <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <q>here we
<lb />stand, waiting your pleasure.  Which is to be the
<lb />happy man?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Each, I hope,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with admirable
<lb />presence of mind, <q>since I expect no less than that
<lb />you will both do me the honour of drinking my
<lb />health.</q></p>
<p><lb />This little contrivance, which saved her alike from
<lb />showing favour or giving offence, could not but be
<pb n="424" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">36</mw>
<lb />applauded by both parties; and while they obeyed
<lb />her orders, she took a third glass herself from the
<lb />servant.</p>
<p><lb />The new partner of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was a wealthy,
<lb />but a very simple young man, used his utmost efforts
<lb />to entertain and oblige her, and flattered by the
<lb />warmth of his own desire, he fancied that he succeed&shy;
<lb />ed; though, in a state of such suspense and anxiety,
<lb />a man of brighter talents had failed.</p>
<p>	    <lb />At the end of the two dances, <persName>Lord Ernolf</persName> again
<lb />attempted to engage her for his son; but she now
<lb />excused herself from dancing any more and sat quiet&shy;
<lb />ly as a spectatress till the rest of the company gave
	    <lb />over.  <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, however, would not quit her,
<lb />and she was compelled to support with him a trifling
<lb />conversation, which, though irksome to herself, to
<lb />him, who had not <emph>seen her in her happier hour</emph>, was
<lb />delightful.</p>
<p><lb />She expected every instant to be again joined by
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName>, but the expectation was disappoint&shy;
<lb />ed; he came not; she concluded he was in another
<lb />apartment; the company was summoned to supper,
<lb />she then thought it impossible to miss him; but, af&shy;
<lb />ter waiting and looking for him in vain, she found he
<lb />had already left the house.</p>
<p><lb />The rest of the evening she scarce knew what pass&shy;
<lb />ed, for she attended to nothing; and before half the
<lb />company left the house, she retired to her own room.</p>
<p><lb />She spent the night in the utmost disturbance; the
	    <lb />occurrences of the evening with respect to young <persName>Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName> she looked upon as decisive:  if his absence had
<lb />chagrined her, his presence had still more shocked
<lb />her, since, while she was left to conjecture, though she
<lb />had fears she had hopes, and though all she saw was
<pb n="425" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">37</mw>
<lb />gloomy, all she expected was pleasant; but they had
<lb />now met, and those expectations proved fallacious.
<lb />She knew not, indeed, how to account for the strange&shy;
<lb />ness of his conduct; but in seeing it was strange, she
<lb />was convinced it was unfavourable:  he had evidently
<lb />avoided her while it was in his power, and when, at
<lb />last, he was obliged to meet her, he was formal, dis&shy;
<lb />tant, and reserved.</p>
<p><lb />The more she recollected and dwelt upon the dif&shy;
<lb />ference of his behaviour in their preceding meeting,
<lb />the more angry as well as amazed she became at the
<lb />change, and though she still concluded the pursuit of
<lb />some other object occasioned it, she could find no ex&shy;
<lb />cuse for his fickleness if that pursuit was recent, nor
<lb />for his caprice if it was anterior.</p>
<p>	    <lb />The next day <persName>Cecilia</persName>, to drive <persName>Delvile</persName> a little from
<lb />her thoughts, which she now no longer wished him to
	    <lb />occupy, again made a visit to <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, whose so&shy;
<lb />ciety afforded her more consolation than any other she
<lb />could procure.</p>
<p><lb />She found her employed in packing up, and prepar&shy;
<lb />ing to remove to another lodging, for her brother, she
<lb />said, was so much better, that he did not think it right
<lb />to continue in so disgraceful a situation.</p>
<p><lb />She talked with her accustomed openness of her
<lb />affairs, and the interest which <persName>Cecilia</persName> involuntarily
<lb />took in them, contributed to lessen her vexation in
<lb />thinking of her own.  <q>The generous friend of my
<lb />brother,</q> said she, <q>who, though but a new acquain&shy;
<lb />tance to him, has courted him in all his sorrows,
<lb />when every body else forsook him, has brought him
<lb />at last into a better way of thinking.  He says there
<lb />is a gentleman whose son is soon going abroad, who
<lb />he is almost sure will like my brother vastly, and in
<pb n="426" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">38</mw>
<lb />another week, he is to be introduced to him.  And
<lb />so, if my mother can but reconcile herself to parting
<lb />with him, perhaps we may all do well again.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Your mother,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>when he is gone,
<lb />will better know the value of the blessing she has
<lb />left in her daughter.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no, madam, no; she is wrapt up in him, and
<lb />cares nothing for all the world besides.  It was al&shy;
<lb />ways so, and we have all of us been used to it.  But
<lb />we have had a sad scene since you were so kind as to
<lb />come last; for when she told him what you had done,
<lb />he was almost out of his senses with anger that we
<lb />had acquainted you with his distresses, and he said it
<lb />was publishing his misery, and undoing whatever his
<lb />friend or himself could do, for it was making him
<lb />ashamed to appear in the world, even when his affairs
<lb />might be better.  But I told him again and again that
<lb />you had as much sweetness as goodness, and instead
<lb />of hurting his reputation, would do him nothing but
<lb />credit.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>I am sorry,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q><persName>Mrs. Belfield</persName> men&shy;
<lb />tioned the circumstance at all:  it would have been
<lb />better, for many reasons, that he should not have
<lb />heard of it.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>She hoped it would please him,</q> answered <persName>Miss
<lb />Belfield</persName>:  <q>however, he made us both promise we
<lb />would take no such step in future, for he said <emph>we</emph>
<lb />were not reduced to such indigence, whatever he was:
<lb />and that as to our accepting money from other peo&shy;
<lb />ple, that we might save up our own for him, it would
<lb />be answering no purpose, for he should think himself
<lb />a monster to make use of it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And what said your mother?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, she gave him a great many promises that
<pb n="427" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">39</mw>
<lb />she would never vex him about it again; and indeed,
<lb />much as I know we are obliged to you, madam, and
<lb />gratefully as I am sure I would lay down my life to
<lb />serve you, I am very glad in this case that my bro&shy;
<lb />ther has found it out.  For though I so much wish
<lb />him to do something for himself, and not to be so
<lb />proud, and live in a manner he has no right to do,
<lb />I think, for all that, that it is a great disgrace to my
<lb />poor father's honest memory, to have us turn beggars
<lb />after his death, when he left us all so well provided
<lb />for, if he had but known how to be satisfied.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>There is a natural rectitude in your heart,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that the ablest casuists could not mend.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then enquired whither they were removing,
	    <lb />and <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> told her to <placeName>Portland Street</placeName>, <placeName>Ox&shy;
<lb />ford Road</placeName>, where they were to have two apartments
<lb />up two pair of stairs, and the use of a very good par&shy;
<lb />lour, in which her brother might see his friends.
<lb /><q>And this,</q> added she, <q>is a luxury for which no&shy;
<lb />body can blame him, because if he has not the ap&shy;
<lb />pearance of a decent home, no gentleman will em&shy;
<lb />ploy him.</q></p>
<p><lb />The Paddington house, she said, was already let,
<lb />and her mother was determined not to hire another,
<lb />but still to live as penuriously as possible, in order,
<lb />notwithstanding his remonstrances, to save all she
<lb />could of her income for her son.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now left <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, and as she returned
<lb />home, had a letter put into her hand which came from
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, whose servants had twice called for an
<lb />answer in the short time she had been absent.</p>
<p><lb />This letter contained a most passionate avowal of
<lb />the impression she had made on his heart the preced&shy;
<lb />ing evening, and an angry complaint that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<pb n="428" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="E4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">40</mw>
<lb />had refused to hear his proposals.  He entreated her
<lb />permission to wait upon her for only five minutes, and
<lb />concluded with the most fervent professions of respect
<lb />and admiration.</p>
<p><lb />The precipitancy of this declaration served merely
<lb />to confirm the opinion she had already conceived of
<lb />the weakness of his understanding:  but the obstinacy
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> irritated and distressed her; though
<lb />weary of expostulating with so hopeless a subject,
<lb />whom neither reason nor gratitude could turn from
<lb />his own purposes, she was obliged to submit to his
<lb />management, and was well content, in the present
<lb />instance, to affirm his decree.  She therefore wrote
<lb />a concise answer to her new admirer, in the usual form
<lb />of civil rejection.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was informed the next morning that a young
<lb />woman begged to speak with her, and upon sending
	    <lb />for her up stairs, she saw, to her great surprise, <persName>Miss
<lb />Belfield</persName>, whom she kindly received, and by assurances
<lb />of the greatest esteem entreated that she would length&shy;
<lb />en her visit.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Delighted by a reception so kind, <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> re&shy;
<lb />mained with her all the morning; and when at last
<lb />she was obliged to leave her, she was but too happy
<lb />in being solicited to repeat her visit.</p>
<p><lb />She suffered one day only to elapse before she
<lb />shewed her readiness to accept the friendship that
<lb />was offered her; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, much pleased by this
<lb />eagerness, redoubled her efforts to oblige and to
<lb />serve her.</p>
<p><lb />From this time, hardly a day passed in which she did
	    <lb />not call in <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, where nothing in her re&shy;
<lb />ception was omitted that could contribute to her con&shy;
<lb />tentment.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> was glad to employ her mind in
<pb n="429" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">41</mw>
	    <lb />any way that related not to <persName>Delvile</persName>, whom she now
<lb />earnestly endeavoured to think of no more, denying
<lb />herself even the pleasure of talking of him with Miss
<lb />Belfield, by the name of <emph>her brother's noble friend</emph>.</p>
<p><lb />During this time she devised various methods, all
<lb />too delicate to give even the shadow of offence, for
<lb />making both useful and ornamental presents to her
<lb />new favourite, with whom she grew daily more satis&shy;
<lb />fied, and to whom she purposed hereafter offering a
<lb />residence in her own house.</p>
<p><lb />The trial of intimacy, so difficult to the ablest to
<lb />stand, and from which even the most faultless are so
	    <lb />rarely acquitted, <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> sustained with honour.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> found her artless, ingenuous, and affectionate;
<lb />her understanding was good, though no pains had
<lb />been taken to improve it; her disposition though
<lb />ardent was soft, and her mind seemed informed by
<lb />intuitive integrity.</p>
<p><lb />She communicated to <persName>Cecilia</persName> all the affairs of her
<lb />family, disguising from her neither distress nor mean&shy;
<lb />ness.  She seemed equally ready to make known to
<lb />her even the most chosen secrets of her own bosom,
<lb />for that such she had was evident, from a frequent
<lb />appearance of absence and uneasiness, which she took
<lb />but little trouble to conceal.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, however,
<lb />trusted not herself, in the present critical situation of
<lb />her own mind, with any enquiries that might lead to
<lb />a subject she was conscious she ought not to dwell
<lb />upon:  a short time, she hoped, would totally remove
<lb />her supense; but as she had much less reason to ex&shy;
<lb />pect good than evil, she made it her immediate study
<lb />to prepare for the worst, and therefore carefully
<lb />avoided all discourse that, by nourishing her tender&shy;
<lb />ness, might weaken her resolution.

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">42</mw></p>
<p><lb />While thus, in friendly conversation and virtuous
<lb />forbearance, passed gravely, but not unhappily, the
<lb />time of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, the rest of the house was very diffe&shy;
<lb />rently employed; feasting, revelling, amusements of
<lb />all sorts were pursued with more eagerness than ever,
<lb />and the alarm which so lately threatened their
<lb />destruction, seemed now merely to heighten the avi&shy;
<lb />dity with which they were sought.  Yet never was
<lb />the disunion of happ<sic corr="">p</sic>iness and diversion more striking
<lb />and obvious:  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, in spite of his natural
<lb />levity, was seized from time to time with fits of horror
<lb />that embittered his gayest moments, and cast a cloud
<lb />upon all his enjoyments.  Always an enemy to soli&shy;
<lb />tude, he now found it wholly insupportable, and ran
<lb />into company of any sort, less from a hope of finding
<lb />entertainment, than from a dread of spending half an
<lb />hour by himself.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who saw that his rapacity for pleasure en&shy;
<lb />creased with his uneasiness, once more ventured to
<lb />speak with his lady upon the subject of reformation;
<lb />counselling her to take advantage of his present appa&shy;
<lb />rent discontent, which shewed at least some sensibility
<lb />of his situation, in order to point out to him the ne&shy;
<lb />cessity of an immediate inspection into his affairs,
<lb />which, with a total change in his way of life, was her
<lb />only chance for snatching him from the dismal des&shy;
<lb />pondency into which he was sinking.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> declared herself unequal to following
<lb />this advice, and said that her whole study was to
<lb />find <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> amusement, for he was grown so ill&shy;
<lb />humoured and petulant, she quite feared being alone
<lb />with him.</p>
<p><lb />The house therefore now was more crowded than
<lb />ever, and nothing but dissipation was thought of.  A&shy;
<pb n="431" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">43</mw>
<lb />mong those who upon this plan were courted to it,
<lb />the foremost was <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, who, from a peculiar
<lb />talent of uniting servility of conduct with gaiety of
<lb />speech, made himself at once so agreeable and useful
<lb />in the family, that in a short time they fancied it im&shy;
<lb />possible to live without him.  And <persName>Morrice</persName>, though
<lb />his first view in obtaining admittance had been the
<lb />cultivation of his acquaintance with <persName>Cecilia</persName>, was per&shy;
<lb />fectly satisfied with the turn that matters had taken,
<lb />since his utmost vanity had never led him to entertain
<lb />any matrimonial hopes with her, and he thought his
<lb />fortune as likely to profit from the civility of her
<lb />friends as of herself.  For <persName>Morrice</persName>, however flighty
<lb />and wild, had always at heart the study of his own
<lb />interest; and though from a giddy forwardness of
<lb />disposition he often gave offence, his meaning and
<lb />his serious attention was not the less directed to
<lb />the advancement of his own affairs:  he formed no
<lb />connection from which he hoped not some benefit,
<lb />and he considered the acquaintance and friend&shy;
<lb />ship of his superiors in no other light than that of
<lb />procuring him sooner or later recommendation to new
<lb />clients.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> was also more frequent than
<lb />ever in his visits, and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, notwithstanding
<lb />the remonstrances of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, contrived every possible
<lb />opportunity of giving him access to her.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>
<lb />herself, tho' hitherto neutral, now pleaded his cause
<lb />with earnestness; and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who had been her
<lb />former refuge from this persecution, grew so serious
<lb />and so tender in his devoirs, that, unable any longer
<lb />to doubt the sentiments she had inspired, she was
<lb />compelled even with him to be guarded and distant.</p>
<p><lb />She now with daily concern looked back to the
<pb n="432" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">44</mw>
<lb />sacrifice she had made to the worthless and ungrateful
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and was sometimes tempted to immedi&shy;
<lb />ately chuse another guardian, and leave his house for
<lb />ever:  yet the delicacy of her disposition was averse
<lb />to any step that might publicly expose him, and her
<lb />early regard for his wife would not suffer her to put
<lb />it in execution.</p>
<p><lb />These circumstances contributed strongly to en&shy;
	    <lb />crease her intimacy with <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>; she now
<lb />never saw <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, whom alone she preferred to
	    <lb />her, and from the troublesome assiduity of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>,
<lb />scarce ever met <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> but in his presence:
<lb />she found, therefore, no resource against teazing and
<lb />vexation, but what was afforded her by the conver&shy;
	    <lb />sation of the amiable <persName>Henrietta</persName>.</p></div>

	    <lb /><hi rend="case(smallcaps)">A Fortnight</hi> had now elapsed in which <persName>Cecilia</persName>
	    <lb />had had no sort of communication with the <name>Delviles</name>,
<lb />whom equally from pride and from prudence she for&shy;
	    <lb />bore to seek herself, when one morning, while <persName>Miss
<lb />Belfield</persName> was sitting with her, she was told by her maid
<lb />that young <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> was in the drawing-room,
<lb />and begged the honour of seeing her for a few
<lb />moments.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though she started and changed colour with
<lb />surprise at this message, was unconcious she did
<lb />either, from the yet greater surprize she received by
	    <lb />the behaviour of <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, who hastily arising,
<pb n="433" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">45</mw>
<lb />exclaimed <q>Good God, <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>!&mdash;&mdash;do you
<lb />know <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, madam?&mdash;&mdash;does <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> visit
<lb />at this house?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Sometimes; not often,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>but
<lb />why</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I don't know,&mdash;nothing, madam,&mdash;I only asked by
<lb />accident,I believe&mdash;but it's very&mdash;it's extremely&mdash;I
<lb />did not know&mdash;&mdash;</q> and colouring violently, she again
<lb />sat down.</p>
<p><lb />An apprehension the most painful now took pos&shy;
<lb />session of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and absorbed in thought, she con&shy;
<lb />tinued for some minutes silent and immoveable.</p>
<p><lb />From this state she was awakened by her maid,
<lb />who asked if she chose to have her gloves.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, taking them from her without speaking,
<lb />left the room, and not daring to stop for enquiry or
<lb />consideration, hastened down stairs; but when she
<lb />entered the apartment where young <persName>Delvile</persName> was
<lb />waiting for her, all utterance seemed denied her, and
<lb />she courtesied without saying a word.</p>
<p><lb />Struck with the look and uncommon manner of her
<lb />entrance, he became in a moment as much disturbed
<lb />as herself, pouring forth a thousand unnecessary and
<lb />embarrassed apologies for his visit, and so totally for&shy;
<lb />getting even the reason why he made it, that he had
<lb />taken his leave, and was departing before he recol&shy;
<lb />lected it.  He then turned back, forcing a laugh at
<lb />his own absence of mind, and told her he had only
<lb />called to acquaint her, that the commands with which
<lb />she had honoured him were now obeyed, and, he
<lb />hoped, to her satisfaction.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who knew not she had ever given him any,
<lb />waited his further explanation; and he then informed
<lb />her he had that very morning introduced <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>
<pb n="434" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">46</mw>
	    <lb />to the Earl of <placeName>Vannelt</placeName>, who had already heard him
<lb />very advantageously spoken of by some gentleman to
<lb />whom he had been known at the University, and who
<lb />was so much pleased with him upon this first interview,
<lb />that he meant, after a few enquiries, which could not
<lb />but turn out to his credit, to commit his eldest son to
	    <lb />his trust in making the tour of <placeName>Europe</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for her share in the trouble he
<lb />had taken in this transaction; and then asked if
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> continued well.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes,</q> answered he with a smile half reproachful,
<lb /><q>as well as one who having ever hoped your favour,
<lb />can easily be after finding that hope disappointed.
<lb />But much as she taught her son, there is one
<lb />lesson she might perhaps learn from him;&mdash;to fly, not
<lb />seek, those dangerous indulgencies of which the de&shy;
<lb />privation is the loss of peace!</q></p>
<p><lb />He then bowed, and made his exit.</p>
<p><lb />This unexpected reproof, and the yet more unex&shy;
<lb />pected compliment that accompanied it, in both which
<lb /><emph>more seemed meant than met the ear</emph>, encreased the
<lb />perturbation into which <persName>Cecilia</persName> had already been
<lb />thrown.  It occurred to her that under the sanction of
<lb />his mother's name, he had taken an opportunity of
<lb />making an apology for his own conduct; yet why
<lb />avoiding her society, if to that he alluded, should be
<lb /><emph>flying a dangerous indulgence</emph>, she could not under&shy;
<lb />stand, since he had so little reason to fear any repulse
<lb />in continuing to seek it.</p>
<p><lb />Sorry, however, for the abrupt manner in which she
	    <lb />had left <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, she lost not a moment in
<lb />hastening back to her, but when she came into the
<lb />room, she found her employed in looking out of the
<lb />window, her eye following some object with such
<pb n="435" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">47</mw>
<lb />earnestness of attention, that she perceived not her
<lb />return.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who could not doubt the motive of her
<lb />curiosity, had not great difficulty in forbearing to offer
<lb />her any interruption.  She drew her head back in a
<lb />few minutes, and casting it upwards, with her hands
<lb />clasped, softly whispered, <q>Heaven ever shield and
<lb />bless him! and O may he never feel such pain as I do!</q></p>
<p><lb />She then again looked out, but soon drawing her&shy;
<lb />self in, said, in the same soft accents, <q>Oh why art
<lb />thou gone! sweetest and noblest of men! why might
<lb />I not see thee longer, when, under heaven, there is
<lb />no other blessing I wish for!</q></p>
<p><lb />A sigh which at these words escaped <persName>Cecilia</persName> made
<lb />her start and turn towards the door; the deepest
<lb />blushes overspread the cheeks of both as their eyes
	    <lb />met each other; and while <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> trembled in
<lb />every limb at the discovery she had made, <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />herself was hardly able to stand.</p>
<p><lb />A painful and most embarrassed silence succeeded,
	    <lb />which was only broken by <persName>Miss Belfield's</persName> bursting
<lb />into tears.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely moved, forgot for a moment her
<lb />own interest in what was passing, and tenderly ap&shy;
<lb />proaching, embraced her with the utmost kindness:
<lb />but still she spoke not, fearing to make any enquiry,
<lb />from dreading to hear any explanation.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, soothed by her softness, clung about
<lb />her, and hiding her face in her arms, sobbed out <q>Ah
<lb />madam! who ought to be unhappy, if befriended by
<lb />you! if I could help it, I would love nobody else in
<lb />almost the whole world.  But you must let me leave
<lb />you now, and to-morrow I will tell you every thing.</q>
<pb n="436" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="F4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">48</mw></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who had no wish for making any opposition,
<lb />embraced her again, and suffered her quietly to
<lb />depart.</p>
<p><lb />Her own mind was now in a state of the utmost
<lb />confusion.  The rectitude of her heart and the sound&shy;
<lb />ness of her judgment had hitherto guarded her both
<lb />from error and blame, and, except during her recent
<lb />suspense, had preserved her tranquillity inviolate;
<lb />but her commerce with the world had been small and
<lb />confined, and her actions had had little reference but
<lb />to herself.  The case was now altered; and she was
<lb />suddenly in a conjuncture of all others the most
<lb />delicate, that of accidentally discovering a rival in a
<lb />favourite friend.</p>
<p>	    <lb />The fondness she had conceived for <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>,
<lb />and the sincerity of her intentions as well as promises
<lb />to serve her, made the detection of this secret pecu&shy;
<lb />liarly cruel:  she had lately felt no pleasure but in her
<lb />society, and looked forward to much future comfort
<lb />from the continuance of her regard, and from their
<lb />constantly living together:  but now this was no longer
<lb />even to be desired, since the utter annihilation of the
<lb />wishes of both, by young <persName>Delvile</persName>'s being disposed of
<lb />to a third person, could alone render eligible their
<lb />dwelling under the same roof.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Her pity, however, for <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, was almost
<lb />wholly unallayed by jealousy; she harboured not
<lb />any suspicion that she was loved by young <persName>Delvile</persName>,
<lb />whose aspiring spirit led her infinitely more to fear
<lb />some higher rival, than to believe he bestowed even
	    <lb />a thought upon the poor <persName>Henrietta</persName>:  but still she
<lb />wished with the utmost ardour to know the length of
<lb />their acquaintance, how often they had met, when
<lb />they had conversed, what notice he had taken of her,
<pb n="437" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">49</mw>
<lb />and how so dangerous a preference had invaded her
<lb />heart.</p>
<p><lb />But though this curiosity was both natural and
<lb />powerful, her principal concern was the arrangement
	    <lb />of her own conduct:  the next day <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> was
<lb />to tell her every thing by a voluntary promise; but
<lb />she doubted if she had any right to accept such a con&shy;
	    <lb />fidence.  <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, she was sure, knew not she
<lb />was interested in the tale, since she had not even
	    <lb />imagined that <persName>Delvile</persName> was known to her.  She might
<lb />hope, therefore, not only for advice but assistance,
<lb />and fancy that while she reposed her secret in the
<lb />bosom of a friend, she secured herself her best offices
<lb />and best wishes for ever.</p>
<p><lb />Would she obtain them? no; the most romantic
<lb />generosity would revolt from such a demand, for how&shy;
	    <lb />ever precarious was her own chance with young <persName>Del&shy;
	      <lb />vile</persName>, <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> she was sure could not have any:
<lb />neither her birth nor education fitted her for his rank
<lb />in life, and even were both unexceptionable, the small&shy;
<lb />ness of her fortune, as <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had instructed
<lb />her, would be an obstacle insurmountable.</p>
<p><lb />Would it not be a kind of treachery to gather from
<lb />her every thing, yet aid her in nothing? to take ad&shy;
<lb />vantage of her unsuspicious openness, in order to
<lb />learn all that related to one whom she yet hoped
<lb />would belong ultimately to herself, and gratify an in&shy;
<lb />terested curiosity at the expence of a candour not
<lb />more simple than amiable?  <q>No,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>arts that I could never forgive, I never will prac&shy;
<lb />tice; this sweet but unhappy girl shall tell me no&shy;
<lb />thing; betrayed already by the tenderness of her own
<lb />heart, she shall at least suffer no further from any
<lb />duplicity in mine.  If, indeed, <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, as I

<lb />suspect, is engaged elsewhere, I will make this gentle
	      <lb /><persName>Henrietta</persName> the object of my future solicitude; the
<lb />sympathy of our situations will not then divide but
<lb />unite us, and I will take her to my bosom, hear all
<lb />her sorrows, and calm her troubled spirit by partici&shy;
<lb />pating in her sensibility.  But if, on the contrary,
	      <lb />this mystery ends more happily for myself, if <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName> has now no other engagement, and hereafter
<lb />clears his conduct to my satisfaction, I will not be
<lb />accessary to loading her future recollection with the
<lb />shame of a confidence she then cannot but repent, nor
<lb />with an injury to her delicacy that may wound it for
<lb />ever.</q></p>
<p><lb />She determined, therefore, carefully to avoid the
<lb />subject for the present, since she could offer no advice
<lb />for which she might not, hereafter, be suspected of
<lb />selfish motives; but yet, from a real regard to the
<lb />tender-hearted girl, to give all the tacit discourage&shy;
<lb />ment that was in her power, to a passion which she
<lb />firmly believed would be productive of nothing but
<lb />misery.</p>
<p><lb />Once, from the frankness natural to her disposition
<lb />she thought not merely of receiving but returning her
<lb />confidence:  her better judgment, however, soon led
<lb />her from so hazardous a plan, which could only have
<lb />exposed them both to a romantic humiliation, by
<lb />which, in the end, their mutual expectations might
<lb />prove sources of mutual distrust.</p>
<p>	    <lb />When <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, therefore, the next morning,
<lb />her air unusually timid, and her whole face covered
<lb />with blushes, made her visit, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, not seeming to
<lb />notice her confusion, told her she was very sorry she
<lb />was obliged to go out herself, and contrived, under
<lb />various pretences, to keep her maid in the room.

	    <lb /><persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, supposing this to be accidental, rejoiced
<lb />in her imaginary reprieve, and soon recovered her
<lb />usual cheerfulness:  and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who really meant
<lb />to call upon <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, borrowed <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s
<lb />carriage, and set down her artless young friend at her
	    <lb />new lodgings in <placeName>Portland-Street</placeName>, before she proceeded
	    <lb />to <placeName>St. James's-Square</placeName>, talking the whole time upon
<lb />matters of utter indifference.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />The reproach which <persName>Cecilia</persName> had received from
<lb />young <persName>Delvile</persName> in the name of his mother, determined
<lb />her upon making this visit; for though, in her present
<lb />uncertainty, she wished only to see that family when
<lb />sought by themselves, she was yet desirous to avoid
<lb />all appearance of singularity, lest any suspicions
<lb />should be raised of her sentiments.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> received her with a cold civility that
<lb />chilled and afflicted her:  she found her seriously
<lb />offended by her long absence, and now for the first
<lb />time perceived that haughtiness of character which
<lb />hitherto she had thought only given to her by the ca&shy;
<lb />lumny of envy; for though her displeasure was un&shy;
<lb />disguised, she deigned not to make any reproaches,
<lb />evidently shewing that her disappointment in the loss
<lb />of her society, was embittered by a proud regret for
<lb />the kindness she believed she had thrown away.  But
<lb />though she scrupulously forbore the smallest com&shy;
<lb />plaint, she failed not from time to time to cast out
<pb n="440" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">52</mw>
<lb />reflections upon fickleness and caprice the most sa&shy;
<lb />tirical and pointed.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who could not possibly avow the motives of
<lb />her behaviour, ventured not to offer any apology for
<lb />her apparent negligence; but, hitherto accustomed
<lb />to the most distinguished kindness, a change to so
<lb />much bitterness, shocked and overpowered her, and
<lb />she sat almost wholly silent, and hardly able to look
<lb />up.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Lady Honoria Pemberton</persName>, a daughter of the Duke
	    <lb />of <placeName>Derwent</placeName>, now came into the room, and afforded
<lb />her some relief by the sprightliness of her conversation.
	    <lb />This young lady, who was a relation of the <name>Delviles</name>,
<lb />and of a character the most airy and unthinking, ran
<lb />on during her whole visit in a vein of fashionable
	    <lb />scandal, with the levity that the censures of <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, though by no means spared, had no power
<lb />to control:  and after having completely ransacked the
<lb />topics of the day, she turned suddenly to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with
	    <lb />whom during her residence in <placeName>St. James's-Square</placeName>
<lb />she had made some acquaintance, and said, <q>So I
<lb />hear, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, that half the town has given you
	      <lb />to <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, and the other half to my <persName>Lord
<lb />Derford</persName>, you intend, without regarding one side or
<lb />the other, to disappoint them both, and give yourself
	      <lb />to <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Me? no, indeed,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>your lady&shy;
<lb />ship has been much misinformed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I hope so,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, <q>for Mr. Mar&shy;
<lb />riot, by all I ever heard of him, seems to have but
<lb />one recommendation, and that the last <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>
<lb />ought to value, a good estate.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, secretly delighted by a speech which she
<lb />could not resist flattering herself had reference to her
<pb n="441" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">53</mw>
<lb />son, now a little revived, and endeavoured to bear
<lb />some part in the conversation.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Every body one meets,</q> cried <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>,
<lb /><q>disposes of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> to some new person; yet
<lb />the common opinion is that <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> will
<lb />be the man.  But upon my word, for my own part,
<lb />I cannot conjecture how she will manage among
	      <lb />them, for <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> declares he's determined he
	      <lb />won't be refused, and <persName>Sir Robert</persName> vows that he'll never
<lb />give her up.  So we none of us know how it will end:
<lb />but I am vastly glad she keeps them so long in
<lb />suspense.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>If there is any suspense,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I am at
<lb />least sure it must be wilful.  But why should your
<lb />ladyship rejoice in it?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, because it helps to torment them, and keeps
<lb />something going forward.  Besides, we are all look&shy;
<lb />ing in the news-papers every day, to see when they'll
<lb />fight another duel for you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Another?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>indeed they have
<lb />never yet fought any for me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, I beg your pardon,</q> answered her ladyship,
	    <lb /><q><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, you know, fought one for you in the
<lb />beginning of the winter, with that Irish fortune-hunter
<lb />who affronted you at the Opera.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Irish fortune-hunter?</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>how
<lb />strangely has that quarrel been misrepresented!  In
<lb />the first place, I never was affronted at the Opera at
	      <lb />all, and in the second, if your Ladyship means <persName>Mr.
		<lb />Belfield</persName>, I question if ever he was in <placeName>Ireland</placeName> in his
<lb />life.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Well,</q> cried <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>, <q>he might come
	      <lb />from <placeName>Scotland</placeName>, for ought I know, but somewhere he
<pb n="442" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">54</mw>
<lb />certainly came from; and they tell me he is wounded
	      <lb />terribly, and <persName>Sir Robert</persName> has had all his things packed
<lb />up this month, that in case he should die, he may go
<lb />abroad in a moment.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>And pray where, <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, <q>do you contrive to pick up all this rattle?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, I don't know; every body tells me something,
<lb />so I put it all together as well as I can.  But I could
<lb />acquaint you with a stranger piece of news than any
<lb />you have heard yet.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And what is that?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, if I let you know it, you'll tell your son.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, indeed,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> laughing, <q>I shall
<lb />probably forget it myself.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then made some further difficulty, and <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />uncertain if she was meant to be a party in the com&shy;
<lb />munication, strolled to a window; where, however,
	    <lb />as <persName>Lady Honoria</persName> did not lower her voice, she heard
<lb />her say <q>Why you must know I am told he keeps a
	      <lb />mistress somewhere in <placeName>Oxford-Road</placeName>.  They say she's
<lb />mighty pretty; I should like vastly to see her.</q></p>
<p><lb />The consternation of <persName>Cecilia</persName> at this intelligence
<lb />would certainly have betrayed all she so much wished
<lb />to conceal, had not her fortunate removal to the win&shy;
<lb />dow guarded her from observation.  She kept her
<lb />post, fearing to look round, but was much pleased when
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, with great indignation answered <q>I am
	      <lb />sorry, <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>, you can find any amusement in
<lb />listening to such idle scandal, which those who tell
<lb />will never respect you for hearing.  In times less
	      <lb />daring in slander, the character of <persName>Mortimer</persName> would
<lb />have proved to him a shield from all injurious asper&shy;
<lb />sions; yet who shall wonder he could not escape, and
<pb n="443" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">55</mw>
	      <lb />who shall contemn the inventors of calumny, if <persName>Lady
<lb />Honoria Pemberton</persName> condescends to be entertained
<lb />with it?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Dear <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>, giddily,
<lb /><q>you take me too seriously.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>And dear <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, <q>I
<lb />would it were possible to make you take yourself seri&shy;
<lb />ously:  for could you once see with clearness and preci&shy;
<lb />sion how much you lower your own dignity, while you
<lb />stoop to depreciate that of others, the very subjects
<lb />that now make your diversion, would then, far more
<lb />properly, move your resentment.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Ay but, dear madam,</q> cried <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>, <q>if
<lb />that were the case, I should be quite perfect, and then
<lb />you and I should never quarrel, and I don't know
<lb />what we should do for conversation.</q></p>
<p><lb />And with these words, hastily shaking hands with
<lb />her, she took leave.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Such conversation,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> when she
<lb />was gone, <q>as results from the mixture of fruitless
<lb />admonition with incorrigible levity, would be indeed
<lb /><emph>more honoured in the breach than the observance</emph>.
<lb />But levity is so much the fashionable characteristic
<lb />of the present age, that a gay young girl who, like
	      <lb /><persName>Lady Honoria Pemberton</persName>, rules the friends by whom
<lb />she ought to be ruled, had little chance of escaping
<lb />it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>She seems so open, however, to reproof,</q> said
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that I should hope in a short time she may
<lb />also be open to conviction.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No,</q> answered <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, <q>I have no hope of
<lb />her at all.  I once took much pains with her; but I
<lb />soon found that the easiness with which she hears of
<lb />her faults, is only another effect of the levity with
<pb n="444" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="G4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">56</mw>
<lb />which she commits them.  But if the young are never
<lb />tired of erring in conduct, neither are the older in
<lb />erring judgment; the falability of <emph>mine</emph> I have in&shy;
<lb />deed very lately experienced.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who strongly felt the poignancy of this sar&shy;
<lb />casm, and whose constant and unaffected value of
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> by no means deserved it, was again
<lb />silenced, and again most cruelly depressed:  nor could
<lb />she secretly forbear repining that at the very moment
<lb />she found herself threatened with a necessity of fore&shy;
	    <lb />going the society of her new favourite, <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>,
<lb />the woman in the whole world whom she most wished
<lb />to have for her friend, from an unhappy mistake was
<lb />ready to relinquish her.  Grieved to be thus fallen in
<lb />her esteem, and shocked that she could offer no justi&shy;
<lb />fication, after a short and thoughtful pause, she grave&shy;
<lb />ly arose to take leave<sic corr=".">,</sic></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> then told her that if she had any busi&shy;
<lb /><sic corr="n">d</sic>ess to transact with <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, she advised her to
<lb />acquaint him with it soon, as the whole family left
<lb />town in a few days.</p>
<p><lb />This was a new and severe blow to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who
<lb />sorrowfully repeated <q>In a few days, madam?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes,</q> answered <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>; <q>I hope you in&shy;
<lb />tend to be much concerned?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ah madam!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who could no longer
<lb />preserve her quietness, <q>if you knew but half the
<lb />respect I bear you, but half the sincerity with which
<lb />I value and revere you, all protestations would be use&shy;
<lb />less, for all accusations would be over!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, at once surprised and softened by the
<lb />warmth of this declaration, instantly took her hand,
<lb />and said <q>They shall now, and for ever be over, if it
<lb />pains you to hear them.  I concluded that what I said
<pb n="445" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="H1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">57</mw>
<lb />would be a matter of indifference to you, or all my
<lb />displeasure would immediately have been satisfied,
<lb />when once I had intimated that your absence had
<lb />excited it.</q>
<lb /><q>That I have excited it at all,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>gives me indeed the severest uneasiness; but believe
<lb />me, madam, however unfortunately appearances may
<lb />be against me, I have always had the highest sense
<lb />of the kindness with which you have honoured me,
<lb />and never has there been the smallest abatement in
<lb />the veneration, gratitude and affection I have invio&shy;
<lb />lably borne you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You see, then,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> with a smile,
<lb /><q>that where reproof takes any effect, it is not received
<lb />with that easiness you were just now admiring:  on
<lb />the contrary, where a concession is made without
<lb />pain, it is also made without meaning; for it is not in
<lb />human nature to project any amendment without a
<lb />secret repugnance.  That here, however, you should
	      <lb />differ from <persName>Lady Honoria Pemberton</persName>, who can won&shy;
<lb />der, when you are superior to all comparison with her
<lb />in every thing!</q>
<lb /><q>Will you then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>accept my apology,
<lb />and forgive me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I will do more,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> laughing, <q>I
<lb />will forgive you <emph>without</emph> an apology; for the truth is
<lb />I have heard none!  But come,</q> continued she, per&shy;
<lb />ceiving <persName>Cecilia</persName> much abashed by this comment, <q>I
<lb />will enquire no more about the matter; I am glad to
<lb />receive my young friend again, and even half ashamed,
<lb />deserving as she is, to say <emph>how</emph> glad!</q></p>
<p><lb />She then embraced her affectionately, and owned
<lb />she had been more mortified by her fancied desertion
<lb />than she had been willing to own even to herself,

<lb />repeatedly assuring her that for many years she had
<lb />not made any acquaintance she so much wished to
<lb />cultivate, nor enjoyed any society from which she had
<lb />derived so much pleasure.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose eyes glistened with modest joy,
<lb />while her heart beat quick with revived expectation, in
<lb />listneing to an effusion of praise so infinitely grateful
<lb />to her, found little difficulty in returning her friendly
<lb />professions, and, in a few minutes, was not merely
<lb />reconciled, but more firmly united with her than ever.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> insisted upon keeping her to dinner,
<lb />and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, but too happy in her earnestness, readily
<lb />agreed to send <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> an excuse.</p>
<p><lb />Neither of the <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>s spent the day at home,
<lb />and nothing, therefore, disturbed or interrupted those
<lb />glowing and delightful sensations which spring from
<lb />a cordial renewal of friendship and kindness.  The
	    <lb />report, indeed, of <persName>Lady Honoria Pemberton</persName> gave her
<lb />some uneasiness; yet the flighty character of that lady,
<lb />and <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>'s reply to it, soon made her drive it
<lb />from her mind.</p>
<p><lb />She returned home early in the evening, as other
<lb />company was expected, and she had not changed her
<lb />dress since the morning; but she first made a promise
<lb />to see <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> some part of every day during
<lb />the short time that she meant to remain in town.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />The next morning opened with another scene;
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> ran into <persName>Cecilia's</persName> room before breakfast,
<pb n="447" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="H2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">59</mw>
<lb />and acquainted her that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had not been at
<lb />home all night.</p>
<p><lb />The consternation with which she heard this account
<lb />she instantly endeavoured to dissipate, in order to
<lb />soften the apprehension with which it was communi&shy;
<lb />cated:  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, however, was extremely uneasy,
<lb />and sent all the town over to make enquiries, but
<lb />without receiving any intelligence.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, unwilling to leave her in a state of such
<lb />alarm, wrote an excuse to <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, that she
<lb />might continue with her till some information was
<lb />procured.  A subject also of such immediate concern,
<lb />was sufficient apology for avoiding any particular con&shy;
	    <lb />versation with <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, who called as usual,
<lb />about noon, and whose susceptible heart was much
<lb />affected by the evident disturbance in which she found
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />The whole day passed, and no news arrived:  but,
<lb />greatly to her astonishment, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> in the
<lb />evening prepared for going to an assembly! yet de&shy;
<lb />claring at the same time it was extremely disagreeable
<lb />to her, only she was afraid, if she stayed away, every
<lb />body would suppose something was the matter.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE300">What at last, </q>thought <persName>Cecilia</persName>,<q id="CE301"> are half so

<lb />toil to please the vain and the idle, undertake a task
<lb />which can never be finished, however scrupulously all

<p><lb />Losing, however, the motive for which she had
<lb />given up her own engagement, she now sent for her
<lb />chair, in order to spend an hour or two with Mrs.
<lb />Delvile.</p>
<p><lb />The servants, as they conducted her up stairs, said
<lb />they would call their lady; and in entering the
<lb />drawing room she saw, reading and alone, young
<lb />Delvile.</p>
<p><lb />He seemed much surprised, but received her with
<lb />the utmost respect, apologizing for the absence of his
<lb />mother, whom he said had understood she was not
<lb />to see her till the next day, and had left him to write
<lb />letters now, that she might then be at liberty.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> in return made excuses for her seeming in&shy;
<lb />consistency; after which, for some time, all conver&shy;
<lb />sation dropt.</p>
<p><lb />The silene was at length broken by young <persName>Delvile</persName>'s
<lb />saying, <q><persName>Mr. Belfield's</persName> merit has not been thrown
	      <lb />away upon <persName>Lord Vannelt</persName>:  he has heard an excellent
<lb />character of him from all his former acquaintance, and
<lb />is now fitting up an apartment for him in his own
<lb />house till his son begins his tour.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> said she was very happy in hearing such
<lb />intelligence; and then again they were both silent.</p>
<p><lb /><q>You have seen,</q> said young <persName>Delvile</persName>, after this
<lb />second pause, <q><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>'s sister?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, not without changing colour, answered,
<lb /><q>Yes, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>She is very amiable,</q> he continued, <q>too amiable,
<lb />indeed, for her situation, since her relations, her
<lb />brother alone excepted, are all utterly unworthy of
<lb />her.</q></p>
<p><lb />He stopt; but <persName>Cecilia</persName> made no answer, and he
<pb n="449" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="H3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">61</mw>
<lb />presently added, <q>Perhaps you do not think her
<lb />amiable?&mdash;&mdash;you may have seen more of her, and
<lb />know something to her disadvantage?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with a forced alacrity,
<lb /><q>but only I was thinking that&mdash;&mdash;did you say you
<lb />knew all her ralations?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No,</q> he answered, <q>but when I have been with
<lb /><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, some of them have called upon him.</q></p>
<p><lb />Again they were both silent; and then <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />ashamed of her apparent backwardness to give praise,
	    <lb />compelled herself to say, <q><persName>Miss Belfield</persName> is indeed a
<lb />very sweet girl, and I wish&mdash;</q> she stopt, not well
<lb />knowing herself what she meant to add.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I have been greatly pleased,</q> said he, after wait&shy;
<lb /><sic corr="ing">soem</sic> time to hear if she would finish her speech, <q>by
<lb />being informed of your goodness to her, and I think
<lb />she seems equally to require and to deserve it.  I
<lb />doubt not you will extend it to her when she is de&shy;
<lb />prived of her brother, for then will be the time that
<lb />by doing her most service, it will reflect on yourself
<lb />most honour.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, confounded by this recommendation, faintly
<lb />answered, <q>Certainly,&mdash;&mdash;whatever is in my power,
<lb />&mdash;I shall be very glad&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb />And just then <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> made her appearance,
<lb />and during the mutual apologies that followed, her
<lb />son left the room.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, glad of any pretence to
<lb />leave it also, insisted upon giving no interruption to
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>'s letter writing, and having promised
<lb />to spend all the next day with her, hurried back to
<lb />her chair.</p>
<p><lb />The reflections that followed her thither were by
<lb />no means the most soothing; she began now to ap&shy;
	    <lb />prehend that the pity she had bestowed upon <persName>Miss
<pb n="450" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="H3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">62</mw>
	      <lb />Belfield</persName>, <persName>Miss Belfield</persName> in a short time might bestow
<lb />upon her:  at any other time, his recommendation
<lb />would merely have served to confirm her opinion of
<lb />his benevolence, but in her present state of anxiety
<lb />and uncertainty, every thing gave birth to conjecture,
<lb />and had power to alarm her.  He had behaved to
<lb />her of late with the strangest coldness and distance,
	    <lb />&mdash;&mdash;his praise of <persName>Henrietta</persName> had been ready and ani&shy;
	    <lb />mated,&mdash;&mdash;<persName>Henrietta</persName> she knew adored him, and she
<lb />knew not with what reason,&mdash;but an involuntary
<lb />suspicion arose in her mind, that the partiality she
<lb />had herself once excited, was now transferred to that
<lb />little-dreaded, but not less dangerous rival.</p>
<p><lb />Yet, if such was the case, what was to become
<lb />either of the pride or the interest of his family?
<lb />Would his relations ever pardon an alliance stimu&shy;
<lb />lated neither by rank nor riches? would <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,
<lb />who hardly ever spoke but to the high-born, without
<lb />seeming to think his dignity somewhat injured, deign
<lb />to receive for a daughter-in-law the child of a citizen
<lb />and tradesman? would <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> herself, little
<lb />less elevated in her notions, though infinitely softer in
<lb />her manners, ever condescend to acknowledge her?
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>'s own birth and connections, superior as they
	    <lb />were to those of <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>, and all her expectations of
<lb />being received into his family were founded upon
<lb />the largeness of her fortune, in favour of which the
<lb />brevity of her genealogy might perhaps pass unno&shy;
	    <lb />ticed.  But what was the chance of <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>,
<lb />who neither had ancestors to boast, nor wealth to
<lb />allure?</p>
<p><lb />This thought, however, awakened all the generosity
<lb />of her soul:  <q>If,</q> cried she, <q>the advantages I pos&shy;
<pb n="451" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="H4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">63</mw>
<lb />sess are merely those of riches, how little should I
<lb />be flattered by any appearance of preference! and
<lb />how ill can I judge with what sincerity it may be
	      <lb />offered! happier in that case is the lowly <persName>Henrietta</persName>,
<lb />who to poverty may attribute neglect, but who can
<lb />only be sought and caressed from motives of purest
<lb />regard.  She loves <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, loves him with the
<lb />most artless affection:&mdash;perhaps, too, he loves her in
<lb />return,&mdash;why else his solicitude to know my opinion
<lb />of her, and why so sudden his alarm when he thought
<lb />it unfavourable?  Perhaps he means to marry her,
<lb />and to sacrifice to her innocence and her attractions
<lb />all plans of ambition, and all views of aggrandize&shy;
	      <lb />ment:&mdash;thrice happy <persName>Henrietta</persName>, if such is thy pros&shy;
<lb />pect of felicity! to have inspired a passion so disin&shy;
<lb />terested, may humble the most insolent of thy
<lb />superiors, and teach even the wealthiest to envy
<lb />thee!</q></p></div>

<p>
<lb />When <persName>Cecilia</persName> returned home, she heard with much
<lb />concern that no tidings of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had not yet
<lb />been obtained.  His lady, who did not stay out late,
<lb />was now very seriously frightened, and entreated
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> to sit up with her till some news could be
<lb />procured:  she sent also for her brother; and they all
<lb />three, in trembling expectation of what was to ensue,
<lb />passed the whole night in watching.
<pb n="452" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="H4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">64</mw></p>
<p><lb />At six o'clock in the morning, <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> besought
<lb />his sister and <persName>Cecilia</persName> to take some rest, promising to
<lb />go out himself to every place where <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was
<lb />known to resort, and not to return without bringing
<lb />some account of him.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, whose feelings were not very acute,
<lb />finding the persuasions of her brother were seconded
<lb />by her own fatigue, consented to follow his advice,
<lb />and desired him to begin his search immediately.</p>
<p>	    <lb />A few moments after he was gone, while <persName>Mrs. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName> and <persName>Cecilia</persName> were upon the stairs, they were startled
<lb />by a violent knocking at the door.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, prepared
<lb />for some calamity, hurried her friend back to the
<lb />drawing-room, and then flying out of it again to en&shy;
<lb />quire who entered, saw to her equal surprise and relief
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> himself.</p>
<p><lb />She ran back with the welcome information, and he
<lb />instantly followed her.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> eagerly told him
<lb />of her fright, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> expressed her pleasure at
<lb />his return; but the satisfaction of neither was of long
<lb />duration.</p>
<p><lb />He came into the room with a look of fierceness
<lb />the most terrifying, his hat on, and his arms folded.
<lb />He made no answer to what they said, but pushed
<lb />back the door with his foot, and flung himself upon a
<lb />sofa.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> would now have withdrawn, but <persName>Mrs. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName> caught her hand to prevent her.  They continued
<lb />some minutes in this situation; and then <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />suddenly rising, called out, <q>Have you any thing to
<lb />pack up?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pack up?</q> repeated <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; <q>Lord bless
<lb />me for what?</q>
<pb n="453" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">65</mw></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am going abroad,</q> he answered; <q>I shall set
<lb />off to-morrow.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Abroad?</q> cried she, bursting into tears; <q>I am
<lb />sure I hope not!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Hope nothing!</q> returned he, in a voice of rage;
<lb />and then, with a dreadful oath, he ordered her to
<lb />leave him and pack up.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, wholly unused to such treatment, was
<lb />frightened into violent hysterics; of which, however,
<lb />he took no notice, but swearing at her for <emph>a fool who
<lb />had been the cause of his ruin</emph>, he left the room.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though she instantly rang the bell, and
<lb />hastened to her assistance, was so much shocked by this
<lb />unexpected brutality, that she scarcely knew how to
<lb />act, or what to order.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, however, soon
<lb />recovered, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> accompanied her to her own
<lb />apartment, where she stayed, and endeavoured to
<lb />soothe her till <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> returned.</p>
<p><lb />The terrible state in which <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had at last
<lb />come home, was immediately communicated to him;
<lb />and his sister entreated him to use all his influence
<lb />that the scheme for going abroad might be deferred,
<lb />at least, if not wholly given up.</p>
<p><lb />Fearfully he went on the embassy, but speedily,
	    <lb />and with a look wholly dismayed, he returned.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, he said, told him, that he had contracted a
<lb />larger debt of honour than he had any means to raise;
<lb />and as he could not appear till it was paid, he was
<lb />obliged to quit the kingdom without delay.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Oh brother!</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>and can you
<lb />suffer us to go?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Alas, my dear sister,</q> answered he, <q> what can I
<lb />do to prevent it? and who, if I too am ruined, will in
<lb />future help you?</q>

<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> then wept bitterly; nor could the gen&shy;
<lb />tle <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> forbear, while he tried to comfort her,
<lb />mixing his own tears with those of his beloved sister:
<lb />but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose reason was stronger, and whose
<lb />justice was offended, felt other sensations; and leav&shy;
<lb />ing <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to the care of her brother, whose
<lb />tenderness she infinitely compassionated, she retreat&shy;
<lb />ed into her own room:  not, however, to rest, the
<lb />dreadful situation of the family made her forget she
<lb />wanted it, but to deliberate upon what course she
<lb />ought herself to pursue.</p>
<p><lb />She determined, without any hesitation, against
<lb />accompanying them in their flight, as the irreparable
<lb />injury she was convinced she had already done her
<lb />fortune, was more than sufficient to satisfy the most
<lb />romantic ideas of friendship and humanity:  but her
<lb />own place of abode must now immediately be chang&shy;
<lb />ed, and her choice rested only between <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>
<lb />and <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />Important as were the obstacles which opposed her
<lb />residence at <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>'s, all that belonged to incli&shy;
<lb />nation and to happiness encouraged it; while with
<lb />respect to <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, though the objections were
<lb />lighter, there was not a single allurement.  Yet, when&shy;
	    <lb />ever the suspicion recurred to her that <persName>Miss Belfield</persName>
<lb />was beloved by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, she resolved at all
<lb />events to avoid him:  but when better hopes inter&shy;
<lb />vened, and represented that his enquiries were pro&shy;
<lb />bably accidental, the wish of being finally acquainted
<lb />with his sentiments, made nothing so desirable as an
<lb />intercourse more frequent.</p>
<p><lb />Such still was her irresolution, when she received a
<lb />message from <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> to entreat the honour of
<lb />seeing her.  She immediately went down stairs, and
<pb n="455" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">67</mw>
<lb />found him in the utmost distress.  <q>O Miss Bever&shy;
<lb />ley,</q> he cried, <q>what can I do for my sister! what
<lb />can I possibly devise to relieve her affliction!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed I know not!</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>but the ut&shy;
<lb />ter impracticability of preparing her for this blow,
<lb />obviously as it <sic corr="h"></sic>as long been impending, makes it now
<lb />fall so heavily, I wish much to assist her&mdash;but a debt
<lb />so unjustly contracted&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O madam,</q> interrupted he, <q>imagine not I sent
<lb />to you with so treacherous a view as to involve you
<lb />into our misery; far too unworthily has your genero&shy;
<lb />sity been already abused.  I only wish to consult with
<lb />you what I can do with my sister.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, after some little consideration, proposed
<lb />that <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> should still be left in England, and
<lb />under their joint care.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Alas!</q> cried he, <q>I have already made that pro&shy;
<lb />posal, but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> will not go without her, though
<lb />his whole behaviour is so totally altered, that I fear to
<lb />trust her with him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Who is there, then, that has more weight with
	      <lb />him?</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>shall we send for <persName>Sir Robert
<lb />Floyer</persName> to second our request?</q></p>
<p><lb />To this <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> assented, forgetting in his ap&shy;
<lb />prehension of losing his sister, the pain he should suf&shy;
<lb />fer from the interference of his rival.</p>
<p><lb />The Baronet presently arrived, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> not
	    <lb />choosing to apply to him herself, left him with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName>, and waited for intelligence in the library.</p>
<p><lb />In about half an hour after, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> ran into
<lb />the room, her tears dried up, and out of breath with
<lb />joy, and called out, <q>My dearest friend, my fate is
<lb />now all in your hands, and I am sure you will not re&shy;
<lb />fuse to make me happy.</q>
<pb n="456" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">68</mw></p>
<p><lb /><q>What is it I can do for you?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />dreading some impracticable proposal; <q>ask not, I
<lb />beseech you, what I cannot perform!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no,</q> answered she; <q>what I ask requires
<lb />nothing but good nature.  <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> has
<lb />been begging of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> to leave me behind; and
<lb />he has promised to comply, upon condition you will
<lb />hasten your marriage, and take me into your own
<lb />house.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>My marriage,</q> cried the astonished <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />Here they were joined by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> himself, who
<lb />repeated the same offer.</p>
<p><lb /><q>You both amaze and shock me!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb /><q>what is it you mean, and why do you talk to me so
<lb />wildly?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>it is high
<lb />time now to give up this reserve, and trifle no longer
	      <lb />with a gentleman so unexceptionable as <persName>Sir Robert
<lb />Floyer</persName>.  The whole town <sic corr="h"></sic>as long acknowledged him
<lb />as your husband, and you are every where regarded
<lb />as his bride; a little frankness, therefore, in accepting
<lb />him, will not only bind him to you for ever, but do
<lb />credit to the generosity of your character.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />At that moment <persName>Sir Robert</persName> himself burst into the
<lb />room, and seizing one of her hands, while both of
<lb />them were uplifted in mute amazement, he pressed it
<lb />to his lips, poured forth a volley of such compliments
<lb />as he had never before prevailed upon himself to ut&shy;
<lb />ter, and confidently entreated her to complete his
<lb />long-intended happiness, without the cruelty of fur&shy;
<lb />ther delay.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, almost petrified by the excess of her sur&shy;
<lb />prise, at an attac<sic corr="k">t</sic> so violent, so bold, and apparently
<lb />so sanguine, was for some time scarce able to speak
<pb n="457" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">69</mw>
	    <lb />or to defend herself; but when <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, presum&shy;
<lb />ing on her silence, said she had made him the hap&shy;
<lb />piest of men, she indignantly drew back her hand,
<lb />and with a look of displeasure that required little ex&shy;
<lb />planation, would have walked out of the room, when
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, in a tone of bitterness and disappoint&shy;
<lb />ment, called out, <q>Is this lady-like tyranny then
	      <lb />never to end?</q>  And <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, impatiently follow&shy;
<lb />ing her, said, <q>And is my suspence to endure for
<lb />ever?  After so many months attendance&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>This, indeed, is something too much,</q> said Ceci&shy;
<lb />lia, turning back.  <q>You have been kept, Sir, in no
<lb />suspence; the whole tenor of my conduct has uni&shy;
<lb />formly declared the same disapprobation I at present
<lb />avow, and which my letter, at least, must have put
<lb />beyond all doubt.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Harrel!</q> exclaimed <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <q>did not you
<lb />tell me&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Pho, pho,</q> cried <persName>Harrel</persName>, <q>what signifies calling
<lb />upon me?  I never saw in <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> any disap&shy;
<lb />probation beyond what is customary for young ladies
<lb />of a sentimental turn to show; and every body knows
<lb />that were a gentleman is allowed to pay his devoirs
<lb />for any length of time, no lady intends to use him
<lb />very severely.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And can you, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>after
<lb />such conversations as have passed between us, per&shy;
<lb />severe in this wilful misapprehension?  But it is in
<lb />vain to debate where all reasoning is disregarded, or
<lb />to make any protestations where even rejection is re&shy;
<lb />ceived as a favour.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, with an air of disdain, she insisted upon
<lb />passing them, and went to her own room.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, however, still followed, and cling&shy;
<pb n="458" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">70</mw>
<lb />ing round her, still supplicated her pity and com&shy;
<lb />pliance.</p>
<p><lb /><q>What infatuation is this!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>is it
<lb />possible that you, too, can suppose I ever mean to ac&shy;
	      <lb />cept <persName>Sir Robert</persName>?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>To be sure I do,</q> answered she; <q>for <persName>Mr. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName> has told me a thousand times, that however you
<lb />played the prude you would be his at last.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though doubly irritated against <persName>Mr. Har&shy;
<lb />rel</persName>, was now appeased with his lady, whose mistake,
<lb />however ill founded, offered an excuse for her beha&shy;
<lb />viour, but she assured her in the strongest terms,
<lb />that her repugnance to the Baronet was unalterable,
<lb />yet told her she might claim from her every good
<lb />office that was not wholly unreasonable.</p>
<p>	    <lb />These were the words of slender comfort to <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, who well knew that her wishes and reason
<lb />had but little affinity, and she soon, therefore left the
<lb />room.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then resolved to go instantly to <persName>Mrs. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>, acquaint her with the necessity of her removal,
<lb />and make her decision whither, according to the man&shy;
<lb />ner in which her intelligence should be received.</p>
<p><lb />She sent, therefore, to order a chair, and was al&shy;
<lb />ready in the hall, when she was stopt by the entrance
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who, addressing her with a look of
<lb />haste and earnestness, said, <q>I will not ask whither
<lb />you are going so early, or upon what errand, for I
<lb />must beg a moment's audience, be your business what
<lb />it may.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then accompanied him to the deserted
<lb />brea<sic corr="k"></sic>fast-room, which none but the servants had this
<lb />morning entered; and there, grasping her hand, he
<lb />said, <q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, you must fly this house direct&shy;
<pb n="459" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="I4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">71</mw>
<lb />ly! it is the region of disorder and licentiousness, and
<lb />unfit to contain you.</q></p>
<p><lb />She assured him she was that moment preparing to
<lb />quit it, but begged he would explain himself.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I have taken care,</q> he answered, <q>for some
<lb />time past, to be well informed of all the proceedings
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>; and the intelligence I procured this
<lb />morning is of the most alarming nature.  I find
<lb />he spent the night before the last entirely at a gaming
<lb />table, where, intoxicated by a run of good luck, he
<lb />passed the whole of the next day in rioting with his
<lb />profligate intimates; and last night, returning again
<lb />to his favourite amusement, he not only lost all he
<lb />had gained, but much more than he could pay.
<lb />Doubt not, therefore, but you will be called upon to
<lb />assist him:  he still considers you as his resource in
<lb />times of danger, and while he knows you are under
<lb />his roof, he will always believe himself secure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Every thing indeed conspires,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />more shocked than surprised at this account, <q>to
<lb />make it necessary I should quit his house, yet I
<lb />do not think he has at present any further expec&shy;
<lb />tations from me, as he came into the room this morning
<lb />not merely without speaking to me, but behaved with
<lb />a brutality to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> that he must be certain
<lb />would give me disgust.  It shewed me, indeed, a new
<lb />part of his character, for ill as I have long thought of
<lb />him, I did not suspect he could be guilty of such un&shy;
<lb />manly cruelty.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>The character of a gamester,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
<lb /><q>depends solely upon his luck; his disposition varies
<lb />with every throw of the dice; and he is airy, gay and
<lb />good-humoured, or sour, morose and savage, neither

<milestone unit="sig" n="I4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">72</mw>
<lb />from nature nor from principle, but wholly by the
<lb />caprice of chance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then related to him the scene in which she
<lb />had just been engaged with <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>This,</q> cried he, <q>is a man&oelig;v<sic corr="">v</sic>re I have been
<lb />some time expecting:  but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, though artful
<lb />and selfish, is by no means deep.  The plan he had
<lb />formed would have succeeded with some women, and
<lb />therefore he concluded it would with all.  So many
<lb />of your sex have been seduced by perseverence, and
<lb />so many have been conquered by boldness, that<sic corr="&amp;blank;"></sic>he
<lb />supposed when he united two such powerful beseigers
<lb />in the person of a baronet, he should vanquish all
<lb />obstacles.  By assuring you that the world thought
<lb />the marriage already settled, he hoped to surprise you
<lb />into believing there was no help for it, and by the
<lb />suddenness and vehemence of the attack, to frighten
<lb />and hurry you into compliance.  His own wife, he
<lb />knew, might have been managed thus with ease, and
<lb />so, probably, might his sister, and his mother, and
<lb />his cousin; for in love matters, or what are so called,
<lb />women in general are readily duped.  He discerned
<lb />not the superiority of your understanding to tricks so
<lb />shallow and impertinent, nor the firmness of your
<lb />mind in maintaining its own independence.  No doubt
<lb />but he was amply to be rewarded for his assistance;
<lb />and probably had you this morning been propitious,
<lb />the baronet in return was to have cleared him from his
<lb />present difficulty.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Even in my own mind,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I can no
<lb />longer defend him; for he could never have been so
	      <lb />eager to promote the interest of <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, in the
<lb />present terrible situation of his own affairs, had he
<pb n="461" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">73</mw>
<lb />not been stimulated by some secret motives.  His
<lb />schemes and his artifices, however, will now be ut&shy;
<lb />terly lost upon me, since your warning and advice,
<lb />aided by my own suffering experience of the inutility
<lb />of all I can do for him, will effectually guard me from
<lb />all his future attempts.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Rest no security upon yourself,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<lb />ton</persName>, <q>since you have no knowledge of the many tricks
<lb />and inventions by which you may be plundered.  Per&shy;
<lb />haps he may beg permission to reside in your house
	      <lb />in <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, or desire an annuity for his wife, or chuse
<lb />to receive your first rents hwen you come of age; and
<lb />whatever he may fix upon, his dagger and his bowl
<lb />will not fail to procure him.  A heart so liberal as
<lb />your's can only be guarded by flight.  You were
<lb />going you said, when I came&mdash;and whither?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>To&mdash;to <placeName>St. James's square</placeName>,</q> answered she, with
<lb />a deep blush.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed!&mdash;is young <persName>Delvile</persName>, then, going abroad?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Abroad?&mdash;no,&mdash;I believe not.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nay, I only imagined it from your chusing to
<lb />reside in his house.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I do not chuse it,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with quickness;
	    <lb /><q>but is not any thing preferable to dwelling with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Certainly,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> coolly; <q>nor
<lb />should I have supposed he had any chance with you,
<lb />had I not hitherto observed that your convenience has
<lb />always been sacrificed to your sense of propriety.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, touched by praise so full of censure, and
<lb />earnest to vindicate her delicacy, after an internal
<lb />struggle, which <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> was too subtle to inter&shy;
<lb />rupt, protested she would go instantly to <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>,
<lb />and see if it were possible to be settled in his house,

<lb />before she made any attempt to fix herself elsewhere.</p>
<p><lb /><q>And when?</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I don't know,</q> answered she, with some hesita&shy;
<lb />tion, <q>perhaps this afternoon.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why not this morning?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I can go out no where this morning; I must stay
<lb />with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You thought otherwise when I came; you were
<lb />then content to leave her.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>'s alacrity, however, for changing her abode,
<lb />was now at an end, and she would fain have been
	    <lb />left quietly to reconsider her plans, but <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<lb />ton</persName> urged so strongly the danger of her lengthened
<lb />stay in the house of so designing a man as <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />that he prevailed with her to quit it without delay,
<lb />and had himself the satisfaciton of handing her to her
<lb />chair.</p></div>

<p>
<lb /><persName>Mr. Briggs</persName> was at home, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> instantly and
<lb />briefly informed him that it was inconvenient for her
<lb />to live any longer at <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s, and that if she
<lb />could be accommodated at his house, she should be
<lb />glad to reside with him during the rest of her mi&shy;

<p><lb /><q>Shall, shall,</q> cried her, extremely pleased, <q>take
	      <lb />you with all my heart.  Warrant master <persName>Harrel's</persName>,
<lb />made a good penny of you.  Not a bit the better for
<lb />dressing so fine; many a rogue in a gold lace hat.</q>
<pb n="463" />

<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> begged to know what apartments he could
<lb />spare for her.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Take you up stairs,</q> cried he; <q>shew you a place
<lb />for a queen.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then led her up stairs, and took her to a room
<lb />entirely dark, and so close for want of air, that she
<lb />could hardly breathe in it.  She retreated to the land&shy;
<lb />ing place till he had opened the shutters, and then
<lb />saw an apartment the most forlorn she had ever be&shy;
<lb />held, containing no other furniture than a ragged
<lb />stuff bed, two worn-out rush-bottomed chairs, an old
<lb />wooden box, and a bit of broken glass which was fas&shy;
<lb />tened to the wall by two bent nails.</p>
<p><lb /><q>See here, my little chick,</q> cried he, <q>every thing
<lb />ready! and a box for your gimcracks into the bargain.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You don't mean this place for me, Sir!</q> cried
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, staring.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Do, do,</q> cried he; <q>a deal nicer by and by.
<lb />Only wants a little furbishing:  soon put to rights.
<lb />Never sweep a room out of use; only wears out
<lb />brooms for nothing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But, Sir, can I not have an apartment on the first
<lb />floor?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no, something else to do with it; belongs to
<lb />the club; secrets in all things!  Make this do well
<lb />enough.  Come again next week; wear quite a new
<lb />face.  Nothing wanting but a table; pick you up one
<lb />at a broker's.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But I am obliged, Sir, to leave <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s
<lb />house directly.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, well, make shift without a table at first;
<lb />no great matter if you ha'nt one at all, nothing parti&shy;
<lb />cular to do with it.  Want another blanket, though.
<lb />Know where to get one; a very good broker hard by.
<pb n="464" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">76</mw>
<lb />Understand how to deal with him!  A close dog, but
<lb />warm.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I have also two servants, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Won't have 'em!  Sha'n't come!  Eat me out
<lb />of house and home.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Whatever they eat, Sir,</q> answered she, <q>will
<lb />be wholly at my expense, as will every thing else that
<lb />belongs to them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Better get rid of them:  hate servants; all a pack
<lb />of rogues; think of nothing but stuffing and guttling.</q></p>
<p><lb />Then opening another door, <q>See here,</q> he cried,
<lb /><q>my own room just by; snug as a church!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, following him into it, lost a great part of
<lb />her surprise at the praise he had lavished upon that
<lb />which he destined for herself, by perceiving that his
<lb />own was yet more scantily furnished, having nothing in
<lb />it but a miserable bed without any curtains, and a
<lb />large chest, which, while it contained his clothes, suf&shy;
<lb />ficed both for table and chair.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now began to repent she had made known
<lb />the purport of her visit, for she found it would be ut&shy;
<lb />terly impossible to accommodate either her mind or
<lb />her person to a residence such as was here to be ob&shy;
<lb />tained:  and she only wished <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had been
<lb />present, that he might himself be convinced of the
<lb />impracticability of his scheme.  Her whole business,
<lb />therefore, now, was to retract her offer, and escape
<lb />from the house.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I see, Sir,</q> said she, <q>that I cannot be received
<lb />here without inconvenience, and therefore I will make
<lb />some new arrangement in my plan.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no,</q> cried he <q>like to have you, 'tis but
	      <lb />fair, all in our turn; won't be choused; <persName>Master Har&shy;
<lb />rel's</persName> had his share.  Sorry could not get you that
<pb n="465" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">77</mw>
<lb />sweet-heart! would not bite; soon find out another;
<lb />never fret.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But there are so many things with which I cannot
<lb />possibly dispense,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>that I am certain
<lb />my removing hither would occasion you far more
<lb />trouble than you at present foresee.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no; get all in order soon:  go about myself;
<lb />know how to bid; understand trap; always go shabby;
<lb />no making a bargain in a good coat.  Look sharp at
<lb />the goods; say they won't do; come away; send
<lb />somebody else for 'em.  Never go twice myself; no&shy;
<lb />thing got cheap if one seems to have a hankering.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But I am sure it is not possible,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />hurrying down stairs, <q>that my room, and one for each
<lb />of my servants, should be ready in time.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, yes,</q> cried he, following her, <q>ready in a
<lb />trice.  Make a little shift at first; double the blanket
<lb />till we get another; lie with the maid a night or two;
<lb />never stand for a trifle.</q></p>
<p><lb />And, when she was seated in her chair, the whole
<lb />time disclaiming her intention of returning, he only
<lb />pinched her cheek with a facetious smirk, and said,
<lb /><q>By, by, little duck; come again soon.  Warrant
<lb />I'll have the room ready.  Shan't half know it again;
<lb />make it as smart as a carrot.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then she left the house; fully satisfied that no
<lb />one could blame her refusing to inhabit it, and much
<lb />less chagrined tha<sic corr="n">t</sic> she was willing <sic corr="t">s</sic>o suppose herself,
<lb />in finding she had now no resource but in the Del&shy;
<lb />viles.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>'s next progress, therefore, was to <placeName>St.
<lb />James's-square</placeName>, whither she went in the utmost anx&shy;
<lb />iety, from her uncertainty of the reception with which
<lb />her proposal would meet.
<pb n="466" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">78</mw></p>
<p>	    <lb />The servants informed her that <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Del&shy;
	      <lb />vile</persName> were at breakfast, and that the Duke of <placeName>Derwent</placeName>
<lb />and his two daughters were with them.</p>
<p><lb />Before such witnesses to relate the reasons of her
<lb />leaving the <name>Harrels</name> was impossible; and from such a

<p>
<lb />From this soothing prospect, <persName>Cecilia</persName> was presently
<lb />disturbed by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>'s maid, who came to entreat
<lb />she would hasten to her lady, whom she feared was
<lb />going into fits.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> flew to her immediately, and found her in
<lb />the most violent affliction.  She used every kind
<lb />effort in her power to quiet and console her, but it
<lb />was not without the utmost difficulty she could sob
<lb />out the cause of this fresh sorrow, which indeed was
<lb />not trifling.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, she said, had told her he
<lb />could not possibly raise money even for his travelling
<lb />expences, without risking a discovery of his project,
<lb />and being seized by his creditors:  he had therefore
<pb n="468" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="K4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">80</mw>
<lb />charged her, through her brother or her friend, to
<lb />procure for him 3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l</term>. as less would not suffice to
<lb />maintain them while abroad, and he knew no method
<lb />by which he could have any remittances without dan&shy;
<lb />ger.  And, when she hesitated in her compliance, he
<lb />furiously accused her of having brought on all this
<lb />distress by her negligence and want of management,
<lb />and declared that if she did not get the money, she
<lb />would only be served as she merited by starving in a
<lb />foreign gaol, which he swore would be the fate of
<lb />them both.</p>
<p><lb />The horror and indignation with which <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />heard this account were unspeakable.  She saw evi&shy;
<lb />dently that she was again to be played upon by terror
	    <lb />and distress, and the cautions and opinions of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> no longer appeared overstained; <emph>one year's
<lb />income</emph> was already demanded, the annuity and the
<lb />country house might next be required; she rejoiced,
<lb />however, that thus wisely fore-warned, she was not
<lb />liable to surprise, and she determined, be their en&shy;
<lb />treaties or representations what they might, to be im&shy;
<lb />movably steady in her purpose of leaving them the
<lb />next morning.  Yet she could not but grieve at suf&shy;
<lb />fering the whole burthen of this clamorous imposition
<lb />to fall upon the soft-hearted <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, whose ina&shy;
<lb />bility to resist solicitation made him so unequal to
<lb />sustaining its weight:  but when <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was
<lb />again able to go on with her account, she heard to
<lb />her infinite surprise, that all application to her bro&shy;
<lb />ther had proved fruitless.  <q>He will not hear me,</q>
<lb />continued <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>and he never was deaf to
<lb />me before! so now I have lost my only and last re&shy;
<lb />source, my brother himself gives me up, and there is
<lb />no one else upon earth who will assist me!</q>
<pb n="469" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">81</mw></p>
<p><lb /><q>With pleasure, with readiness, with joy,</q> cried
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>should you find assistance from me, were it
<lb />to you alone it were given; but to supply fuel for the

<lb />heart is hardened against gaming and gamesters, and
<lb />neither now or ever will I suffer any consideration to
<lb />soften me in their favour.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> only answered by tears and lamenta&shy;
<lb />tions; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose justice shut not out com&shy;
<lb />passion, having now declared her purposed firmness,
<lb />again attempted to sooth her, entreating her not to
<lb />give way to such immoderate grief, since better pros&shy;
<lb />pects might arise from the very gloom now before her,
<lb />and a short time spent in solitude and &oelig;conomy, might
<lb />enable her to return to her native land with recovered
<lb />happiness.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No, I shall never return!</q> cried she, weeping,
<lb /><q>I shall die, I shall break my heart before I have
<lb />been banished a month!  Oh <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, how
<lb />happy are you! able to stay where you please,&mdash;rich
<lb />&mdash;rolling in wealth which you do not want&mdash;of which
<lb />had we but one year's income only, all this misery
<lb />would be over, and we might stay in our dear, dear
<lb />country!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, struck by a hint that so nearly bordered
<lb />upon reproach, and offended by seeing the impossibi&shy;
<lb />lity of ever doing enough, while any thing remained
<lb />to be done, forbore not without difficulty enquiring
<lb />what next was expected from her, and whether any
<lb />part of her fortune might be guarded, without giving
<lb />room for some censure! but the deep affliction of
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> soon removed her resentment, and
<lb />scarcely thinking her, while in a state of such wretch&shy;

<lb />recollection, she mildly replied, <q>As affluence is all
<lb />comparative, you may at present think I have more
<lb />than my share:  but the time is only this moment
<lb />past, when your own situation seemed as subject to
<lb />the envy of others as mine may be now.  My future
<lb />destiny is yet undetermined, and the occasion I may
<lb />have for my fortune is unknown to myself; but whe&shy;
<lb />ther I possess it in peace or in turbulence, whether
<lb />it proves to be a blessing or an injury, so long as I
<lb />can call it my own, I shall always remember with
<lb />alacrity the claim upon that and upon me which early
<lb />friendship has so justly given <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.  Yet
<lb />permit me, at the same time, to add, that I do not
<lb />hold myself so entirely independent as you may pro&shy;
<lb />bably suppose me.  I have not, it is true, any rela&shy;
<lb />tions to call me to account, but respect for their me&shy;
<lb />mory supplies the place of their authority, and I can&shy;
<lb />not, in the distribution of the fortune which has de&shy;
<lb />volved to me, forbear sometimes considering how they
<lb />would have wished it should be spent, and always re&shy;
<lb />membering that what was acquired by industry and
<lb />labour, should never be dissipated in idleness and
<lb />vanity.  Forgive me for thus speaking to the point;
<lb />you will not find me less friendly to yourself, for this
<lb />frankness with respect to your situation.</q></p>
<p><lb />Tears were again the only answer of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>;
<lb />yet <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who pitied the weakness of her mind,
<lb />stayed by her with the most patient kindness till the
<lb />servants announced dinner.  She then declared she
<lb />would not go down stairs:  but <persName>Cecilia</persName> so strongly
<lb />represented the danger of awakening suspicion in the
<lb />servants that she at last prevailed with her to make
<lb />her appearance.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was already in the parlour, and en&shy;

<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> could eat nothing; <persName>Cecilia</persName>, merely to

<lb />in his affairs.</p>
<p><lb />When the servants were gone, he desired his wife
<lb />to step for a moment with him into the library.  They
<lb />soon returned, and then <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, after walking in
<lb />a disordered manner about the room, rang the bell,
<lb />and ordered his hat and cane, and as he took them,
<lb />said <q>if this fails&mdash;</q> and, stopping short, without
<lb />speaking to his wife, or even bowing to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he
<lb />hastily went out of the house.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> told <persName>Cecilia</persName> that he had merely called
<lb />her to know the event of her two petitions, and had
<lb />heard her double failure in total silence.  Whither
<lb />he was now gone it was not easy to conjecture, nor
<lb />what was the new resource which he still seemed to
<lb />think worth trying; but the manner of his quitting
<lb />the house, and the threat implied by <q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post(&amp;rdquo;)slant(italic)">if this fails,</q>
<lb />contributed not to lessen the grief of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and
<lb />gave to <persName>Cecilia</persName> herself the utmost alarm.</p>
<p><lb />They continued together till tea-time, the servants
	    <lb />having been ordered to admit no company.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> himself then returned, and returned, to the
	    <lb />amazement of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, accompanied by <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />He presented that young man to both the ladies as
<lb />a gentleman whose acquaintance and friendship he
<pb n="472" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">84</mw>
<lb />was very desirous to cultivate.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, too
<lb />much absorbed in her own affairs to care about any
<lb />other, saw his entrance with a momentary surprise,
<lb />and then thought of it no more:  but it was not so
<lb />with <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose better understanding led her to
<lb />deeper reflection.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Even the visits of <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> but a few weeks
<lb />since <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had prohibited, yet he now introduced
<lb />him into his house with particular distinction; he
<lb />came back too himself in admirable spirits, enlivened
<lb />in his countenance, and restored to his good humour.
<lb />A change so extraordinary both in conduct and dis&shy;
<lb />position, convinced her that some change no less ex&shy;
<lb />traordinary of circumstance must previously have
<lb />happened:  what that might be it was not possible for
<lb />her to divine, but the lessons she had received from
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> led her to suspicions of the darkest
<lb />kind.</p>
<p><lb />Every part of his behaviour served still further to
	    <lb />confirm them; he was civil even to excess to <persName>Mr.
<lb />Marriot</persName>; he gave orders aloud not to be at home to
<lb /><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>:  he made his court to <persName>Cecilia</persName> with
<lb />unusual assiduity, and he took every method in his
<lb />power to procure opportunity to her admirer of ad&shy;
<lb />dressing and approaching her.</p>
<p><lb />The young man, who seemed enamoured even to
<lb />madness, could scarce refrain not merely from pro&shy;
<lb />stration to the object of his passion, but to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />himself, for permitting him to see her.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who
<lb />not without some concern perceived a fondness so
<lb />fruitless, and who knew not by what arts or with what
<lb />views <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> might think proper to encourage it,
<lb />determine to take all the means that were in her
<lb />own power towards giving it immediate control.  She
<pb n="473" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">85</mw>
<lb />behaved, therefore, with the utmost reserve, and the
<lb />moment tea was over, though earnestly entreated to
<lb />remain with them, she retired to her own room, with&shy;
<lb />out making any other apology than coldly saying she
<lb />could not stay.</p>
<p><lb />In about an hour <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> ran up stairs to her.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Oh <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> she cried, <q>a little respite is
<lb />now granted me!  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> says he shall stay ano&shy;
<lb />ther day; he says, too, one single thousand pound
<lb />would now make him a new man.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> returned no answer; she conjectured some
<lb />new deceit was in agitation to raise money, and she
	    <lb />feared <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> was the next dupe to be played
<lb />upon.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, therefore, with a look of the utmost
<lb />disappointment, left her, saying she would send for
<lb />her brother, and once more try if he had yet any re&shy;
<lb />maining regard for her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> rested quiet till eleven o'clock, when she
	    <lb />was summoned to supper:  she found <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> still
<lb />the only guest, and that <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> made not his ap&shy;
<lb />pearance.</p>
<p><lb />She now resolved to publish her resolution of going
	    <lb />the next morning to <placeName>St. James's-square</placeName>.  As soon,
<lb />therefore, as the servants withdrew, she enquired of
<lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> if he had any commands with Mr. or
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, as she should see them the next
<lb />morning, and purposed to spend some time with them.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, with a look of much alarm, asked if she
<lb />meant the whole day.</p>
<p><lb />Many days, she answered, and probably some
<lb />months.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> exclaimed her surprise aloud, and <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> looked aghast; while his new young friend cast
<pb n="474" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">86</mw>
<lb />upon him a glance of reproach and resentment, which
<lb />fully convinced <persName>Cecilia</persName> he imagined he had procured
<lb />himself a title to an easiness of intercourse and fre&shy;
<lb />quency of meeting which this intelligence destroyed.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, thinking, after all that had passed, no
<lb />other ceremony on her part was necessary but that of
<lb />simply speaking her intention, then arose and return&shy;
<lb />ed to her own room.</p>
<p><lb />She acquainted her maid that she was going to
<lb />make a visit to <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, and gave her directions
<lb />about packing up her clothes, and sending for a man
<lb />in the morning to take care of her books.</p>
<p><lb />This employment was soon interrupted by the en&shy;
<lb />trance of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who desiring to speak with
	    <lb />her alone, when the maid was gone, said, <q>O <persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>, can you indeed be so barbarous as to leave
<lb />me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I entreat you, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q>to save both yourself and me any further discus&shy;
<lb />sions.  I have delayed this removal very long, and I
<lb />can now delay it no longer.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> then flung herself upon a chair in the
<lb />bitterest sorrow, declaring she was utterly undone;
<lb />that <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had declared he could not stay even
	    <lb />an hour in <placeName>England</placeName> if she was not in his house; that
	    <lb />he had already had a violent quarrel with <persName>Mr. Mar&shy;
<lb />riot</persName> upon the subject; and that her brother, though
<lb />she had sent him the most earnest entreaties, would
<lb />not come near her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, tired of vain attempts to offer comfort, now
<lb />urged the warmest expostulations against her oppo&shy;
<lb />sition, strongly representing the real necessity of her
<lb />going abroad, and the unpardonable weakness of
<lb />wishing to continue such a life as she now led, adding
<lb />debt to debt, and hording distress upon distress.
<pb n="475" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="L4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">87</mw></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> then, though rather from compulsion
<lb />than conviction, declared she would agree to go, if
<lb />she had not a dread of ill usage; but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, she
<lb />said, had behaved to her with the utmost brutality,
<lb />calling her the cause of his ruin, and threatening that
<lb />if she procured not this thousand pound before the
<lb />ensuing evening, she should be treated as she deserv&shy;
<lb />ed for her extravagance and folly.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Does he think, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with the
<lb />utmost indignation, <q>that I am to be frightened
<lb />through your fears into what compliances he
<lb />pleases?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>no; his expectations
<lb />are all from my brother.  He surely thought that
<lb />when I supplicated and pleaded to him, he would do
<lb />what I wished, for so he always did formerly, and so
<lb />once again I am sure he will do now; could I but make
<lb />him come to me, and tell him how I am used, and tell
<lb />him that if <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> takes me abroad in this hu&shy;
<lb />mour, I verily think in his rage he will half murder me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who well knew that she herself was the
<lb />cause of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>'s resistance, now felt her resolu&shy;
<lb />tion waver, internally reproaching herself with the
<lb />sufferings of his sister:  alarmed, however, for her
<lb />own constancy, she earnestly besought <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to
<lb />go and compose herself for the night, and promised to
<lb />deliberate what could be done for her before morning.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> complied; but scarce was her own
<lb />rest more broken than that of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who, though
<lb />extremely fatigued with a whole night's watching,
<lb />was so perturbed in her mind she could not close
<lb />her eyes.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />The next morning, by five o'clock, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>
<lb />came into <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s room to know the result of her
<lb />deliberation; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with that graceful readi&shy;
<lb />ness which accompanied all her kind offices, instantly
<lb />assured her the thousand pound should be her own,
<lb />if she would consent to seek some quiet retreat and
<lb />receive it in small sums, of fifty or one hundred
<lb />pounds at a time, which should be carefully trans&shy;
<lb />mitted, and which, by being delivered to herself,
<lb />might secure better treatment from <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and
<lb />be a motive to revive his care and affeciton.</p>
<p><lb />She flew, much delighted, with this proposal to her
<lb />husband; but presently, and with a dejected look,
<lb />returning, said, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> protested he could not
<lb />possibly set out without first receiving the money.
<lb /><q>I shall go myself, therefore,</q> said she, <q>to my bro&shy;
<lb />ther after breakfast, for he will not, I see, unkind as
<lb />he has grown, come to me; and if I do not succeed
<lb />with him, I believe I shall never come back!</q></p>
<p><lb />To this <persName>Cecilia</persName>, offended and disappointed, answer&shy;
<lb />ed, <q>I am sorry for <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, but for myself I have
<lb />done.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> then left her, and she arose to make
	    <lb />immediate preparations for her removal to <placeName>St. James's
<lb />Square</placeName>, whither, with all the speed in her power, she
<lb />sent her books, her trunks, and all that belonged
<lb />to her.</p>
<p><lb />When she was summoned down stairs, she found,
<pb n="477" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">89</mw>
<lb />for the first time, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> breakfasting at the same
<lb />table with his wife:  they seemed mutually out of
<lb />humour and comfortless; nothing hardly was spoken,
<lb />and little was swallowed.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, however, was
<lb />civil, but his wife was totally silent, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> the
<lb />whole time was planning how to take her leave.</p>
<p><lb />When the tea-things were removed, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />said, <q>You have not, I hope, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, quite
<lb />determined upon this strange scheme?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed I have, Sir,</q> she answered, <q>and already
<lb />I have sent my clothes.</q></p>
<p><lb />At this information he seemed thunder-struck; but,
<lb />after somewhat recovering, said with much bitterness,
<lb /><q>Well, madam, at least may I request you will stay
<lb />here till the evening?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir,</q> answered she coolly, <q>I am going in&shy;
<lb />stantly.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And will you not,</q> said he, with yet greater as&shy;
<lb />perity, <q>amuse yourself first with seeing bailiffs take
	      <lb />possession of my house, and your friend <persName>Priscilla</persName> fol&shy;
<lb />low me to jail?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Good God, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>!</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with
<lb />uplifted hands, <q>is this a question, is this behaviour
<lb />I have merited!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no!</q> cried he, with quickness, <q>should I once
<lb />think that way&mdash;&mdash;</q> then rising and striking his fore&shy;
<lb />head, he walked about the room.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> arose too, and weeping violently went
<lb />away.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Will you at least,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, when she was
	    <lb />gone, <q>till your affairs are settled, leave <persName>Priscilla</persName>
<lb />with me?  When I go into my own house, she shall
<lb />accompany me, and mean time <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>'s I am
<lb />sure will gladly be open to her.</q>

<p><lb /><q>No, no,</q> answered he, <q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">she deserves no such
<lb />indulgence; she has not any reason to complain;
<lb />she has been as negligent, as profuse, as expen&shy;
<lb />sive as myself; she has practised neither &oelig;co&shy;
<lb />nomy, nor self-denial, she has neither thought of me
<lb />nor my affairs, nor is she now afflicted at any thing
<lb />but the loss of that affluence she has done her best to&shy;
<lb />wards diminishing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>All recrimination,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>were vain, or
<lb />what might not <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> urge in return! but let
<lb />us not enlarge upon so ungrateful a subject, the
<lb />wisest and the happiest scheme now were mutually
<lb />and kindly to console each other.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Consolation and kindness,</q> cried he, with abrupt&shy;
<lb />ness, <q>are out of the question.  I have ordered a
<lb />post-chaise to be here at night, and if till then you
<lb />will stay, I will promise to release you without fur&shy;
<lb />ther petition:  if not, eternal destruction be my por&shy;
<lb />tion if I <emph>live</emph> to see the scene which your removal will
<lb />occasion!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>My removal!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, shuddering, <q>good
<lb />heaven, and how can my removal be of such dreadful
<lb />consequence?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ask me not,</q> cried he, fiercely, <q>questions or
<lb />reasons now; the crisis is at hand, and you will soon,
<lb />happen what may, know all.  Mean time, what I
<lb />have said is a fact, and immutable; and you must
<lb />hasten my end, or give me a chance for avoiding it, as
<lb />you think fit.  I scarce care at this instant which way
<lb />you decide.  Remember, however, all I ask of you is
<lb />to defer your departure; what else I have to hope is
<lb />from <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then left the room.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now was again a coward!  In vain she call&shy;
<pb n="479" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">91</mw>
<lb />ed to her support the advice, the prophesies, the cau&shy;
<lb />tion of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, in vain she recollected the im&shy;
<lb />positions she had already seen practised, for neither
<lb />the warnings of her counsellor, nor the lessons of her
<lb />own experience, were proofs against the terrors
<lb />which threat so desperate inspired:  and though more
<lb />than once she determined to fly at all events from a
<lb />tyranny he had so little right to usurp, the mere re&shy;
<lb />membrance of the words <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">if you stay not till night I
<lb />will not live</q>, robbed her of all courage; and however
<lb />long she had prepared herself for this very attack,
<lb />when the moment arrived, its power over her mind
<lb />was too strong for resistance<sic corr=".">,</sic></p>
<p><lb />While this conflict between fear and resolution

<p>
<lb />In the midst of her apprehensions for herself and
<lb />her own interest, <persName>Cecilia</persName> could not forbear rejoicing
<lb />that <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, at least, had escaped the present
<lb />storm; yet she was certain it would not fall the more
	    <lb />heavily upon herself, and dreaded the sight of <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName> after the shock which this flight would oc&shy;
<lb />casion.</p>
<p><lb />Her expectations were but too quickly fulfilled.
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> in a short time after rushed wildly into
<lb />the room, calling out, <q>My brother is gone! he has
<lb />left me for ever!  Oh save me, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, save
<lb />me from abuse and insult!</q>  And she wept with so
<lb />much violence she could utter nothing more.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, quite tortured by this persecution, faintly
<lb />asked what she could do for her?</p>
<p><lb /><q>Send,</q> cried she, <q>to my brother, and beseech
<lb />him not to abandon me! send to him and conjure him
<lb />to advance this thousand pound!&mdash;the chaise is al&shy;
<lb />ready ordered&mdash;<persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> is fixed upon going&mdash;yet
<lb />he says, without that money we must both starve in a
<lb />strange land.&mdash;O send to my cruel brother! he has
<lb />left word that nothing must follow him that does not
<lb />come from you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>For the world, then,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>would I
<lb />not baffle his discretion! indeed you must submit to
<lb />your fate, indeed, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, you must endeavour
<lb />to bear it better.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, shedding a flood of tears, declared
<lb />she would try to follow her advice, but again besought
<lb />her in the utmost agony to send after her brother,
<lb />protesting she did not think even her life would be
<lb />safe in making so long a journey with <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> in
<lb />his present state of mind.  His character, she said,
<lb />was totally changed, his gaiety, good humour, and
<pb n="481" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">93</mw>
<lb />sprightliness were turned into roughness and morose&shy;
<lb />ness, and, since his great losses at play, he was grown
<lb />so fierce and furious, that to oppose him even in a
<lb />trifle, rendered him quite outrageous in passion.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though truly concerned, and almost melted,
<lb />yet refused to interfere with <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and even
<lb />thought it but justice to acknowledge she had advised
<lb />his retreat.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>And can you have been so cruel?</q> cried <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, with still encreasing violence of sorrow, <q>to
<lb />rob me of my only friend, to deprive me of my bro&shy;
<lb />ther's affection, at the very time I am forced out of
<lb />the kingdom, with a husband who is ready to murder
<lb />me, and who says he hates the sight of me, and all be&shy;
<lb />cause I cannot get him this fatal, fatal money!&mdash;O
<lb /><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, how could I have thought to have had
<lb />such an office from you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was beginning a justification, when a mes&shy;
<lb />sage came from <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, desiring to see his wife
<lb />immediately.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, in great terror, cast herself at Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia's feet, and clinging to her knees, called out, <q>I
<lb />dare not go to him!  I dare not go to him! he wants
<lb />to know my success, and when he hears my brother
	      <lb />is run away, I am sure he will kill me!&mdash;Oh <persName>Miss Be&shy;
<lb />verley</persName>, how could you send him away? how could
	      <lb />you be so inhuman as to leave me to the rage of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, distressed and trembling herself, conjured
<lb />her to rise and be consoled; but <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, weak
<lb />and frightened, could only weep and supplicate.  <q>I
<lb />don't ask you,</q> she cried, <q>to give the money your&shy;
<lb />self, but only to send for my brother, that he may pro&shy;

<lb />rel</persName>, <q>let me but see my brother, and his heart will
<lb />yield to my distress, and he will soften <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> by
<lb />giving his unhappy sister this parting bounty.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then took a pen in her hand to write to <persName>Mr<sic corr=".">-</sic>
<lb />Arnott</persName>; but struck almost at the same moment with
<lb />a notion of treachery in calling him from a retreat
<lb />which her own counsel had made him seek, professed&shy;
<lb />ly to expose him to a supplication which, from his
<lb />present situation, might lead him to ruin, she hastily
<lb />flung it from her, and exclaimed, <q>No, excellent
<lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, I will not so unworthily betray you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And can you, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, can you at last,</q>
<lb />cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>be so barbarous as to retract?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>No, my poor <persName>Priscilla</persName>,</q> answered <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>I can&shy;
<lb />not so cruelly disappoint you; my pity shall however
	      <lb />make no sufferer but myself&mdash;I cannot send for <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName>&mdash;from me you must have the money, and may
<lb />it answer the purpose for which it is given, and re&shy;
<lb />store to you the tenderness of your husband, and the
<lb />peace of your own heart!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Priscilla</persName>, scarce waiting to thank her, flew with this
<pb n="483" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">95</mw>
<lb />intelligence to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>; who with the same im&shy;
<lb />petuosity, scarce waiting to say he was glad of it, ran
	    <lb />himself to bring the <name>Jew</name> from whom the money was
<lb />to be procured.  Every thing was soon settled, Ceci&shy;
<lb />lia had no time for retracting, and repentance they
<lb />had not the delicacy to regard.  Again, therefore,
<lb />she signed her name for paying the principal and in&shy;
<lb />terest of another 1000l. within ten days after she was
<lb />of age; and having taken the money, she accompa&shy;
	    <lb />nied <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> into another room.  Pre&shy;
	    <lb />senting it then with an affecting solemnity to <persName>Mrs.
	      <lb />Harrel</persName>, <q>Accept, <persName>Priscilla</persName>,</q> she cried, <q>this irre&shy;
<lb />fragable mark of the sincerity of my friendship; but
<lb />suffer me at the same time to tell you, it is the last to
<lb />so considerable an amount I ever mean to offer; re&shy;
<lb />ceive it, therefore, with kindness, but use it with dis&shy;
<lb />cretion.</q></p>
<p><lb />She then embraced her, and eager now to avoid ac&shy;
<lb />knowledgement, as before she had been to escape im&shy;
<lb />portunities, she left them together.</p>
<p><lb />After dinner <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was all civility and good
<lb />humour.  He warmly thanked <persName>Cecilia</persName> for the kind&shy;
<lb />ness she had shown him, and gaily added, <q>You
<lb />should be absolved from all the mischief you may do
<lb />for a twelvemonth to come, in reward for the preser&shy;
<lb />vation from mischief which you have this day af&shy;
<lb />fected.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>The preservation,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>will, I hope,
<lb />be for many days.  But tell me, Sir, exactly, what
<lb />time I may acquaint <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> I shall wait upon
<lb />her?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Perhaps,</q> he answered, <q>by eight o'clock; per&shy;
<lb />haps by nine; you will not mind half an hour?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre()post(&amp;rdquo;)">Certainly not,</q> she answered, unwilling by disput&shy;
<pb n="484" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="M4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">96</mw>
<lb />ing about a trifle to diminish his satisfaction in her
<lb />assistance.  She wrote, therefore, another note to
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, desiring she would not expect her till
<lb />near ten o'clock, and promising to account and apolo&shy;
<lb />gize for these seeming caprices when she had the ho&shy;
<lb />nour of seeing her.</p>
<p><lb />The rest of the afternoon she spent wholly in ex&shy;
<lb />horting <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to show more fortitude, and con&shy;
<lb />juring her to study nothing but &oelig;conomy, prudence,
<lb />and housewifery.  A lesson now hard for the thought&shy;
	    <lb />less and negligent <persName>Priscilla</persName>! she heard the advice
<lb />with repugnance, and only answered it with helpless
<lb />complaints that she knew not how to spend less mo&shy;
<lb />ney than she always had done.</p>
<p><lb />After tea, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, still in high spirits, went
	    <lb />out, entreating <persName>Cecilia</persName> to stay with <persName>Priscilla</persName> till his
<lb />return,<sic corr="">,</sic> which he promised should be early.</p>
<p><lb />Nine o'clock, however, came, and he did not ap&shy;
<lb />pear.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> then grew anxious to keep her appoint&shy;
<lb />ment with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>; but ten o'clock also came,
<lb />and still <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> was absent.</p>
<p><lb />She then determined to wait no longer, and rang
	    <lb />the bell for her servant and chair.  But when <persName>Mrs.
	      <lb />Harrel</persName> desired to be informed the moment that <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> returned, the man said he had been come
<lb />back more than half an hour.</p>
<p><lb />Much surprised, she enquired where he was.</p>
<p><lb /><q>In his own room, madam, and gave orders not to
<lb />be disturbed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was not much pleased at this account,
<lb />was easily persuaded to stay a few minutes longer;
<lb />and, fearing some new evil, she was going to send him
<lb />a message, by way of knowing how he was employed,
<lb />when he came himself into the room.

<p><lb /><q>Well, ladies,</q> he cried, in a hurrying manner,

<p>	    <lb /><q><placeName>Vauxhall</placeName>!</q> repeated <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, while <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />staring, perceived in his face a look of perturbation
<lb />that extremely alarmed her.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Come, come,</q> he cried, <q>we have no time to
<lb />lose.  A hackney coach will serve us; we won't
<lb />wait for our own.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Have you then given up going abroad?</q> said
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no; where can we go from half so well?
<lb />Let us live while we live!  I have ordered a chaise to

<p><lb /><q>First,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>let me wish you both good

<p><lb /><q>Will you not go with me?</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>;
	    <lb /><q>how can I go to <placeName>Vauxhall</placeName> alone?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are not alone,</q> answered she; <q>but if I go,
<lb />how am I to return?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>She shall return with you,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>if
<lb />you desire it; you shall return together.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, starting up in rapture, called out,
	    <lb /><q>Oh <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, will you indeed leave me in <placeName>Eng&shy;

<p><lb /><q>Yes,</q> answered he reproachfully, <q>if you will
<lb />make a better friend than you have made a wife, and
<lb />if <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> is content to take charge of you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What can all this mean?</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb /><q>is it possible you can be serious?  Are you really
<lb />going yourself, and will you suffer <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> to
<lb />remain?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am,</q> he answered, <q>and I will.</q></p>
<p><lb />Then ringing the bell, he ordered a hackney coach.</p>

	    <lb />nor <persName>Cecilia</persName> for amazement; while <persName>Mr. Harre<sic corr="l"></sic></persName>, at&shy;
<lb />tending to neither of them, walked for some time si&shy;
<lb />lently about the room.</p>
<p><lb /><q>But how,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName> at last, <q>can I possibly
<lb />go?  <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> must already be astonished at my
<lb />delay; and if I disappoint her again, she will hardly
<lb />receive me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O make not any difficulties,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> in
<lb />an agony; <q>if <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> will let me stay, sure you
<lb />will not be so cruel as to oppose him?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But why,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>should either of us go
	      <lb />to <placeName>Vauxhall</placeName>? surely that is no place for a parting so
<lb />melancholy.</q></p>
<p><lb />A servant then came in, and said the hackney coach
<lb />was at the door.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, starting at the sound, called out,
<lb /><q>Come, what do we wait for?  If we go not immedi&shy;
<lb />ately, we may be prevented.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then again wished them good night, pro&shy;
<lb />testing she could fail <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> no longer.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, half wild at this refusal, conjured
<lb />her in the most frantic manner to give way, exclaim&shy;
<lb />ing, <q>Oh cruel! cruel! to deny me this last request,
<lb />I will kneel to you day nad night,</q> sinking upon the
<lb />ground before her, <q>and I will serve you as the hum&shy;

<p><lb /><q>Oh rise, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, ashamed of
<lb />her prostration, and shocked by her vehemence, <q>rise
<lb />and let me rest!&mdash;it is painful to me to refuse, but to
	      <lb />comply for ever, in defiance of my judgment&mdash;Oh <persName>Mrs.

<p><lb /><q>Come,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> impetuously, <q>I wait

<p><lb /><q>No, no,</q> cried he, with quickness, <q>I must take
<lb />care of her myself.  I shall not carry her abroad with
<lb />me; but the only legacy I can leave her, is a warning
<lb />which I hope she will remember for ever.  You, how&shy;
<lb />ever, need not go.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>What,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>leave me at <placeName>Vaux&shy;
<lb />hall</placeName>, and yet leave me alone?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What of that?</q> cried he with fierceness; <q>do
<lb />you not desire to be left?  Have you any regard for
<lb />me, or for any thing upon earth but yourself?  Cease
<lb />these vain clamours, and come, I insist upon it, this
<lb />moment.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, with a violent oath, he declared he would
<lb />be detained no longer, and approached in great rage
<lb />to seize her.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> shrieked aloud; and the
<lb />terrified <persName>Cecilia</persName> exclaimed, <q>If indeed you are to

<p><lb /><q>And why,</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, more gently, yet

<p>
	    <lb />When they entered <placeName>Vauxhall</placeName>, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> endea&shy;
<lb />voured to dismiss his moroseness, and affecting his
<lb />usual gaiety, struggled to recover his spirits:  but the
<lb />effort was vain, he could neither talk nor look like
<lb />himself; and though from time to time he resumed
<lb />his air of wonted levity, he could not support it, but
<lb />drooped and hung his head in evident despondency.</p>
<p><lb />He made them take sever<sic corr="a">e</sic>l turns in the midst of
<lb />the company, and walked so fast, that they could
<lb />hardly keep pace with him, as if he hoped by exer&shy;
<lb />cise to restore his vivacity; but every attempt failed,
<lb />he sunk and grew sadder, and muttering between his
<lb />teeth <q>this is not to be borne!</q> he hastily called to a
<lb />waiter to bring him a bottle of champagne.</p>
<p><lb />Of this he drank glass after glass, notwithstanding
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, as <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> had not courage to speak,
<lb />entreated him to forbear.  He seemed, however, not
<lb />to hear her; but when he had drunk what he thought
<lb />necessary to revive him, he conveyed them into an un&shy;
<lb />frequented part of the garden, and as soon as they
<pb n="489" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="N3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">101</mw>
<lb />were out of sight of all but a few stragglers, he sud&shy;
<lb />denly stopt, and, in great agitation, said, <q>My chaise
<lb />will soon be ready, and I shall take of you a long
<lb />farewell!&mdash;All my affairs are unpropitious to my
<lb />speedy return;&mdash;the wine is now mounting into my
<lb />head, and perhaps I may not be able to say much by
	      <lb />and by.  I fear I have been cruel to you, <persName>Priscilla</persName>,
<lb />and I begin to wish I had spared you this parting
<lb />scene; yet let it not be banished your remembrance,
<lb />but think of it when you are tempted to such mad
<lb />folly as has ruined us.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> wept too much to make any answer;
<lb />and turning from her to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>Oh madam,</q> he
<lb />cried, <q>to you, indeed, I dare not speak!  I have used
<lb />you most unworthily, but I pay for it all!  I ask you
<lb />not to pity or forgive me, I know it is impossible you
<lb />should do either.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No,</q> cried the softened <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>it is not impos&shy;
<lb />sible, I do both at this moment and I hope&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Do not hope,</q> interrupted he; <q>be not so an&shy;
<lb />gelic, for I cannot bear it!  Benevolence like yours
<lb />should have fallen into worthier hands.  B<sic corr="u">n</sic>t come,
<lb />let us return to the company.  My head grows giddy,
<lb />but my heart is still heavy; I must make them more
<lb />fit companions for each other.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />He would then have hurried them back; but <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>, endeavouring to stop him, said, <q>You do not
<lb />mean, I hope, to call for more wine?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why not?</q> cried he, with affected spirit; <q>what,
<lb />shall we not be merry before we part?  Yes, we will
<lb />all be merry; for if we are not, how shall we part at
<lb />all?&mdash;Oh not without a struggle!&mdash;</q>  Then, stopping,
<lb />he paused a moment, and casting off the mask of levity,
<lb />said in accents the most solemn, <q>I commit this

<lb />packet to <emph>you</emph>,</q> giving a sealed parcel to <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>had
<lb />I written it later, its contents had been kinder to my
<lb />wife, for now the hour of separation appraoches, ill&shy;
	      <lb />will and resentment subside.  Poor <persName>Priscilla</persName>!&mdash;I am
<lb />sorry&mdash;but you will succour her, I am sure you will.
<lb />&mdash;Oh had I known you myself before this infatuation
<lb />&mdash;bright pattern of all goodness!&mdash;But I was devoted,
<lb />&mdash;a ruined wretch before ever you entered my house;
<lb />unworthy to be saved, unworthy that virtues such as
<lb />yours should dwell under the same roof with me!
<lb />But come,&mdash;come now, or my resolution will waver,
<lb />and I shall not go at last.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But what is this packet?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>and why
<lb />do you give it to me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No matter, no matter, you will know by and by;
<lb />&mdash;the chaise waits, and I must gather courage to be
<lb />gone.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then pressed forward answering neither to remon&shy;
<lb />strance nor intreaty from his frightened companions.</p>
<p><lb />The moment they returned to the covered walk,
	    <lb />they were met by <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, starting,
<lb />endeavoured to pass him; but when he approached,
<lb />and said, <q>You have sent, Sir, no answer to my

<lb />said, <q>No, Sir, but I shall answer it to-morrow, and
<lb />to-night I hope you will do me the honour of supping

<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, looking openly at <persName>Cecilia</persName> as his in&shy;

<p><lb /><q>To supper!</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>what here?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To supper!</q> repeated <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>and how are we

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">103</mw></p>
<p><lb /><q>Think not of that these two hours,</q> answered he;
<lb /><q>come, let us look for a box.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then grew quite urgent with him to give
	    <lb />up a scheme which must keep them so late; and <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName> repeatedly exclaimed, <q>Indeed people will
<lb />think it very odd to see us here without any party!</q>
<lb />But he heeded them not; and perceiving at some dis&shy;
	    <lb />tance <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, he called out to him to find them
<lb />a box; for the evening was very pleasant, and the
<lb />gardens were so much crowded, that no accommoda&shy;
<lb />tion was unseized.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Sir,</q> cried <persName>Morrice</persName>, with his usual readiness,
<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;lsquo;)post(&amp;rdquo;)">I'll get you one if I turn out ten old Aldermen
<lb />sucking custards.</q></p>
<p><lb />Just after he was gone, a fat, sleek, vulgar-looking
<lb />man, dressed in a bright purple coat, with a deep red
<lb />waistcoat, and a wig bulging far from his head with
<lb />small round curls, while his plump face and person
<lb />announced plenty and good living, and an air of de&shy;
<lb />fiance spoke the fulness of his purse, strutted boldly
<lb />up to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and accosting him in a manner that
<lb />shewed some diffidence of his reception, but none of
<lb />his right, said, <q>Sir, your humble servant;</q> and
<lb />made a bow first to him, and then to the ladies.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Sir, yours,</q> replied <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> scornfully, and
<lb />without touching his hat he walked on.</p>
<p><lb />His fat acquaintance, who seemed but little dis&shy;
<lb />posed to be offended with impunity, instantly replaced
<lb />his hat on his head, and with a look that implied
<lb /><emph>I'll fit you for this!</emph> put his hands to his sides, and
<lb />following him, said, <q>Sir, I must make bold to beg
<lb />the favour of exchanging a few words with you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Ay, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>come to me to&shy;

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">104</mw>
<lb />morrow, and you shall exchange as many as you
<lb />please.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Nothing like the time present, Sir,</q> answered
<lb />the man; <q>as for to-morrow, I believe it intends to
<lb />come no more; for I have heard of it any time these
<lb />three years.  I mean no reflecitons, Sir, but let every
<lb />man have his right.  That's what I say, and that's my
<lb />notion of things.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, with a violent execration, asked what
	    <lb />he meant by dunning him at such a place as <placeName>Vauxhall</placeName>?</p>
<p><lb /><q>No place, Sir,</q> he replied, <q>is as good as ano&shy;
<lb />ther place:  for so as what one does is good, 'tis no
<lb />matter for where it may be.  A <emph>man of business</emph>
<lb />never wants a counter, if he can meet with a joint&shy;
<lb />stool.  For my part, I'm all for a clear conscience,
<lb />and no bills without receipts to them.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>And if you were all for broken bones,</q> cried <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, angrily, <q>I would oblige you with them with&shy;
<lb />out delay.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Sir,</q> cried the man, equally provoked, <q>this is
<lb />talking quite out of character; for as to broken bones,
	      <lb />there's ne'er a person in all <placeName>England</placeName>, gentle nor sim&shy;
<lb />ple, can say he's a right to break mine, for I am not
<lb />a person of that sort, but a man of as good property
<lb />as another man; and there's ne'er a customer I have
<lb />in the world that's more his own man than myself.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Lord bless me, <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb /><q>don't follow us in this manner!  If we meet any of
<lb />our acquaintance, they'll think us half crazy.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Ma'am,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, again taking off
<lb />his hat, <q>if I'm treated with proper respect, no man
<lb />will behave more generous than myself! but if I am
<lb />affronted, all I can say is, it may go harder with some
<lb />folks than they think for.</q>
<pb n="493" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">105</mw></p>
<p><lb />Here a little mean-looking man, very thin, and al&shy;
<lb />most bent double with perpetual cringing, came up to
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, and pulling him by the sleeve, whispered,
<lb />yet loud enough to be heard, <q>It's surpriseable to me,
	      <lb /><persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, you can behave so out of the way!  For
<lb />my part, perhaps I've as much my due as another
<lb />person, but I dares to say I shall have it when con&shy;
<lb />venient, and I'd scorn for to mislest a gentleman when
<lb />he's taking his pleasure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord bless me,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, <q>what shall
<lb />we do now? here's all <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s creditors coming
<lb />upon us!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Do!</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, re-assuming an air of
<lb />gaiety, <q>why give them all a supper, to be sure.
<lb />Come, gentlemen, will you favour me with your com&shy;
<lb />pany to supper?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Sir,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, somewhat softened
<lb />by this unexpected invitation, <q>I've supped this hour
<lb />and more, and had my glass too, for I'm as willing to
<lb />spend my money as another man; only what I say is
<lb />this, I don't chuse to be cheated, for that's losing
<lb />one's substance, and getting no credit; however, as
<lb />to drinking another glass, or such a matter as that,
<lb />I'll do it with all the pleasure in life.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And as to me,</q> said the other man, whose name
	    <lb />was <persName>Simkins</persName>, and whose head almost touched the
<lb />ground by the profoundness of his reverence, <q rend="pre()post(&amp;rdquo;)">I can't
<lb />upon no account think of taking the liberty; but if I
<lb />may just stand without, I'll make bold to go so far as
<lb />just for to drink my humble duty to the ladies in a cup
<lb />of cyder.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Are you mad, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, are you mad!</q> cried
<lb />his wife, <q>to think of asking such people as these to
<lb />supper?  What will every body say?  Suppose any

<lb />of our acquaintance should see us?  I am sure I shall
<lb />die with shame.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Mad!</q> repeated he; <q>no, not mad, but merry.
<lb />O ho, <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, why have you been so long? what
<lb />have you done for us?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Morrice</persName>, returning with a
<lb />look somewhat less elated than he had set out, <q>the
<lb />gardens are so full, there is not a box to be had:  but
<lb />I hope we shall get one for all that; for I observed
<lb />one of the best boxes in the garden, just to the right
<lb />there, with nobody in it but that gentleman who made
<lb />me spill the tea-pot at the Pantheon.</q>  So I made an
<lb />apology, and told him the case; but he only said
<lb /><q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">humph?</q> and <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">hay</q> so then I told it all over again,
<lb />but he served me just the same, for he never seems to
<lb />hear what one says till one's just done, and then he
<lb />begins to recollect one's speaking to him; however,
<lb />though I repeated it all over and over again, I could
<lb />get nothing from him but just that <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">humph?</q> and <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">hay?</q>
<lb /><q>but he is so remarkably absent, that I dare say if we
<lb />all go and sit down round him, he won't know a word
<lb />of th<sic corr="e"></sic> matter.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q rend="pre()post(&amp;rdquo;)">Won't he?</q> cried <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>have at him, then!</q></p>
<p><lb />And he followed <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, though <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who
<lb />now half suspected that all was to end in a mere idle
<lb />frolic, warmly joined her remonstrances to those of
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, which were made with the utmost, but
<lb />with fruitless earnestness.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, who was seated in the middle of the box,
<lb />was lolloping upon the table with his customary ease
<lb />and picking his teeth with his usual inattention to all
<lb />about him.  The intrusion, however, of so large a
<lb />party, seemed to threaten his insensibility with un&shy;
<lb />avoidable disturbance; though, imagining they meant
<pb n="495" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="O2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">107</mw>
<lb />but to look in at the box, and pass on, he made not
<lb />at their first approach any alteration in his attitude
<lb />or employment.</p>
<p><lb /><q>See ladies,</q> cried the officious <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q>I told
<lb />you there was room; and I am sure this gentleman
<lb />will be very happy to make way for you, if it's only
<lb />out of good-nature to the waiters, as he is neither eat&shy;
<lb />ing nor drinking, nor doing any thing at all.  So if
<lb />you two ladies will go in at that side, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and
	      <lb />that other gentleman,</q> pointing to <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>,
<lb /><q>may go to the other, and then I'll sit by the ladies
<lb />here, and those other two gentlemen&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />Here <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, raising himself from his reclin&shy;
<lb />ing posture, and staring <persName>Morrice</persName> in the face, gravely
<lb />said, <q>What's all this, Sir!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Morrice</persName>, who expected to have arranged the whole
<lb />party without a question, and who understood so lit&shy;
<lb />tle of modish airs to suspect neither affectation nor
<lb />trick in the absence of mind and indolence of manners
	    <lb />which he observed in <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, was utterly
<lb />amazed by this interrogatory, and staring himself in
<lb />return, said, <q>Sir, you seemed so thoughtful&mdash;I did
<lb />not think&mdash;I did not suppose you would have taken
<lb />any notice of just a person or two coming into the box.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Did not you, Sir?</q> said <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> very coldly;
<lb /><q>why then now you do, perhaps you'll be so obliging
<lb />as to let me have my own box to myself.</q></p>
<p><lb />And then again he returned to his favourite position.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Certainly, Sir,</q> said <persName>Morrice</persName>, bowing; <q>I am
<lb />sure I did not mean to disturb you:  for you seemed
<lb />so lost in thought, that I'm sure I did not much believe
<lb />you would have seen us.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Why, Sir,</q> said <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, strutting forward,
<lb /><q>if I may speak my opinion, I should think, as you
<lb />happen to be quite alone, a little agreeable company
<pb n="496" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="O2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">108</mw>
<lb />would be no such bad thing.  At least that's my
<lb />notion.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And if I might take the liberty,</q> said the smooth
	    <lb />tongued <persName>Mr. Simkins</persName>, <q>for to put in a word, I should
<lb />think the best way would be, if the gentleman has no
<lb />peticklar objection, for me just to stand somewhere
<lb />hereabouts, and so when he's had what he's a mind to,
<lb />be ready for to pop in at one side, as he comes out at
<lb />the t'other; for if one does not look pretty 'cute such
<lb />a full night as this, a box is whipt away before one
<lb />knows where one is.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no, no,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> impatiently;
<lb /><q>let us neither sup in this box nor in any other; let
<lb />us go away entirely.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed we must! indeed we ought!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>;
<lb /><q>it is utterly improper we should stay; pray let us
<lb />begone immediately.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> paid not the least regard to these re&shy;
	    <lb />quests; but <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, who could no longer seem
<lb />unconscious of what passed, did himself so much vio&shy;
<lb />lence as to arise, and ask if the ladies would be seated.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I said so!</q> cried <persName>Morrice</persName> triumphantly; <q>I was
<lb />sure there was no gentleman but would be happy to
<lb />accommodate two such ladies!</q></p>
<p><lb />The ladies, however, far from happy in being so
<lb />accommodated, again tried their utmost influence in
<lb />persuading <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> to give up this scheme, but he
<lb />would not hear them; he insisted upon their going
	    <lb />into the box, and, extending the privilege which <persName>Mr.
<lb />Meadows</persName> had given, he invited without ceremony the
<lb />whole party to follow.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, though he seemed to think this a very
<lb />extraordinary encroachment, had already made such
<lb />an effort from his general langour, in the repulse he
<lb />had given to <persName>Morrice</persName>, that he could exert himself no
<pb n="497" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="O3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">109</mw>
<lb />further; but after looking around him with mingled
<lb />vacancy and contempt, he again seated himself, and
<lb />suffered <persName>Morrice</persName> to do the honours without more op&shy;
<lb />position.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Morrice</persName>, but too happy in the office, placed <persName>Cecilia</persName>
	    <lb />next to <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, and would have made <persName>Mr.
<lb />Marriot</persName> her other neighbour, but she insisted upon
<lb />not being parted from <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; and therefore, as
	    <lb />he chose to sit also by that lady himself, <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>
<lb />was obliged to follow <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> to the other side of
	    <lb />the box.  <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, without further invitation,
<lb />placed himself comfortably in one of the corners; and
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Simkins</persName>, who stood modestly for some time in
<lb />another, finding the further encouragement for which
<lb />he waited was not likely to arrive, dropt quietly into
<lb />his seat without it.</p>
<p><lb />Supper was now ordered, and while it was prepar&shy;
	    <lb />ing, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> sat totally silent; but <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>
<lb />thought proper to force himself to talk with <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />though she could well have dispensed with such an
<lb />exertion of his politeness.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Do you like this place, ma'am?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed, I hardly know,&mdash;I never was here before.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No wonder! the only surprise is, that any body
<lb />can come to it at all.  To see a set of people walking
<lb />after nothing! strolling about without view or object!
<lb />'tis strange! don't you think so ma'am?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes,&mdash;I believe so,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, scarce hearing
<lb />him.</p>
<p><lb /><q>O it gives me the vapours, the horrors,</q> cried he
<lb /><q rend="pre()post(&amp;rdquo;)">to see what poor creatures we all are! taking plea&shy;
<lb />sure even from the privation of it! forcing ourselves
<lb />into exercise and toil, when we might at least have
<lb />the indulgence of sitting still and reposing!</q>
<pb n="498" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">110</mw></p>
<p><lb /><q>Lord, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q>don't you like
<lb />walking?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Walking?</q> cried he, <q>I know nothing so humi&shy;
<lb />lating:  to see a rational being in such mechanical
<lb />motion! with no knowledge upon what principles he
<lb />proceeds, but plodding on, one foot before another,
<lb />without even any consciousness which is first, or how
<lb />either&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Sir,</q> interrupted <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, <q>I hope you
<lb />won't take it amiss if I make bold to tell my opinion;
<lb />for my way is this, let every man speak his maxim!
<lb />But what I say as to this matter, is this, if a man must
<lb />always be stopping to consider what foot he is stand&shy;
<lb />ing upon, he had need have little to do, being the
<lb />right does as well as the left, and the left as well as
<lb />the right.  And that, Sir, I think, is a fair argument.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName> deigned no other answer to this
<lb />speech than a look of contempt.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I fancy, Sir,</q> said <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q>you are fond of
<lb />riding, for all your good horsemen like nothing else.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Riding!</q> exclaimed <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>; <q>oh barbar&shy;
<lb />ous!  Wrestling and boxing are polite arts to it!
<lb />Trusting to the discretion of an animal less intellec&shy;
<lb />tual than ourselves! a sudden spring may break all
<lb />our limbs, a stumble may fracture our skulls!  And
<lb />what is the inducement? to get melted with heat,
<lb />killed with fatigue, and, and covered with dust! mi&shy;
<lb />serable infatuation!&mdash;Do you love riding, ma'am?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, very well, Sir.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am glad to hear it,</q> cried he, with a vacant
<lb />smile; <q>you are quite right; I am entirely of your
<lb />opinion.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Simkins</persName> now, with a look of much perplexity,
<lb />yet rising and bowing, said <q>I don't mean, Sir, to be
<pb n="499" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="O4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">111</mw>
<lb />so rude as to put in my oar, but if I did not take you
<lb />wrong, I'm sure just now I thought you seemed for to
<lb />make no great 'count of riding, and yet now, all of
<lb />the sudden, one would think you was a speaking up
<lb />for it!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q>if you neither like
<lb />riding nor walking, you can have no pleasure at all
<lb />but only in sitting.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Sitting!</q> repeated <persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, with a yawn,
<lb /><q>O worse and worse<sic corr="">,</sic>! it dispirits me to death! it
<lb />robs me of all fire and life! it weakens circulation,
<lb />and destroys elasticity.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Pray then, Sir,</q> said <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q>do you like any
<lb />better to stand?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To stand?  O intolerable! the most unmeaning
<lb />thing in the world! one had better be made a
<lb />mummy!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Why then, pray Sir,</q> said <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, <q>let me
<lb />ask the favour of you to tell us what it is you do like?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, though he stared him full in the
<lb />face, began picking his teeth without making any
<lb />answer.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>You see, <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>,</q> said <persName>Mr. Simkins</persName>, <q>the
<lb />gentleman has no mind for to tell you, but if I may
<lb />take the liberty just to put in, I think if he neither
<lb />likes walking, nor riding, nor sitting, nor standing;
<lb />I take it he likes nothing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Well, Sir,</q> said <persName>Morrice</persName>, <q>but here comes sup&shy;
<lb />per, and I hope you will like that.  Pray, Sir, may I
<lb />help you to a bit of this ham?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Meadows</persName>, not seeming to hear him, suddenly,
<lb />and with an air of extreme weariness, and without
<lb />speaking to any body, abruptly made his way out of
<lb />the box.
<pb n="500" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="O4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">112</mw></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> now, starting from the gloomy reverie
<lb />into which he had sunk, undertook to do the honours
<lb />of the table, insisting with much violence upon help&shy;
<lb />ing every body, calling for more provisions, and strug&shy;
<lb />gling to appear in high spirits and good humour.</p>
<p><lb />He then called for more wine, and insisted that
	    <lb />every body should pledge him.  <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> and <persName>Mr.
	      <lb />Morrice</persName> made not any objection, and <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName> and
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Simkins</persName> consented with much delight.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> now grew extremely unruly, the wine
<lb />he had already drunk being thus powerfully aided;
<lb />and his next project was to make his wife and <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />follow his example.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, more incensed than
<lb />ever to see no preparation made for his departure, and
<lb />all possible means taken to unfit him for setting out,
<lb />refused him with equal firmness and displeasure, and
<lb />lamented with the bitterest self-reproaches, the con&shy;
<lb />sent which had been forced from her to be present at
<lb />a scene of such disorder.  But <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> would
<lb />have opposed him in vain, had not his attention been
	    <lb />called off to another object.  This was <persName>Sir Robert
<lb />Floyer</persName>, who perceiving the party at some distance,
	    <lb />no sooner observed <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> in such company,
<lb />than, advancing to the box with an air of rage and de&shy;
<lb />fiance, he told <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> he had something to say
<lb />to him.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Ay,</q> cried <persName>Harrel</persName>, <q>say to me? and so have I to
<lb />say to you!  come amongst us and be merry!  Here,
<lb />make room, make way!  Sit close, my friends!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, who now saw he was in no situation to
<lb />be reasoned with, stood for a moment silent; and
	    <lb />then looking round the box, and observing <persName>Messrs.
	      <lb />Hobson</persName> and <persName>Simkins</persName>, he exclaimed aloud, <q>Why,
<pb n="501" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">113</mw>
<lb />what queer party have you got into? who the d&mdash;l
<lb />have you picked up here?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, who, to the importance of lately ac&shy;
<lb />quired wealth, now added the courage of newly drunk
<lb />champagne, stoutly kept his ground, without seeming
<lb />at all conscious he was included in this interrogation;
	    <lb />but <persName>Mr. Simkins</persName>, who had still his way to make into he
<lb />world, and whose habitual civility would have resist&shy;
<lb />ed a larger draught, was easily intimidated; he again,
<lb />therefore, stood up, and with the most cringing re&shy;
<lb />spect, offered the Baronet his place; who, taking nei&shy;
<lb />ther of the offer nor offerer the smallest notice, still
<lb />stood opposite to <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, waiting for some ex&shy;
<lb />planation.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, however, who now grew really inca&shy;
<lb />pable of giving any, only repeated his invitation, that
<lb />he would make one among them.</p>
<p><lb /><q>One among you?</q> cried he, angrily, and point&shy;
	    <lb />ing to <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, <q>why you don't fancy I'll sit
<lb />down with a bricklayer?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A bricklayer?</q> said <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, <q>ay, sure, and
	      <lb />a hosier too; sit down, <persName>Mr. Simkins</persName>, keep your
<lb />place, man!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Simkins</persName> most thankfully bowed; but <persName>Mr. Hob&shy;
<lb />son</persName>, who could no longer avoid feeling the per&shy;
<lb />sonality of this reflection, boldly answered, <q>Sir, you
<lb />may sit down with a worse man any day in the week!
<lb />I have done nothing I'm ashamed of, and no man can
<lb />say to me, why did you do so?  I don't tell you, Sir,
<lb />what I'm worth; no one has a right to ask?  I only
<lb />say three time five is fifteen! that's all.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why what the d&mdash;l, you impudent fellow,</q> cried

<p>	    <lb /><q>Sir,</q> answered <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, very hotly, <q>I
<lb />sha'n't put up with abuse from no man!  I've got a
<lb />fair character in the world, and wherewithal to live
<lb />by my own liking.  And what I have is my own, and
<lb />all I say is, let every one say the same, for that's the
<lb />way to fear no man, and face the d&mdash;l.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>What do you mean by that, fellow?</q> cried <persName>Sir
<lb />Robert</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Fellow, Sir! this is talking no-how.  Do you
<lb />think a man of substance, that's got above the
<lb />world, is to be treated like a little scrubby appren&shy;
<lb />tice?  Let every man have his own, that's always my
<lb />way of thinking; and this I can say for myself, I have
<lb />as good a right to shew my head where I please as
<lb />ever a member of parliament in all England; and I
<lb />wish every body here could say as much.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName>, fury starting into his eyes, was begin&shy;
<lb />ning an answer; but <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> with terror, and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> with dignity, calling upon them both to for&shy;
<lb />bear, the Baronet desired <persName>Morrice</persName> to relinquish his
<lb />place to him, and seating himself next to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />gave over the contest.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Meanwhile <persName>Mr. Sim<sic corr="">p</sic>kins</persName>, hoping to ingratiate him&shy;
	    <lb />self with the company, advanced to <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, al&shy;
<lb />ready cooled by finding himself unanswered, and re&shy;
	    <lb />proachfully said, <q><persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, if I may make so free,
<lb />I must needs be bold to say I am quite ashamed of
<lb />you! a person of your standing and credit for to talk
<lb />so disrespectful! as if a gentleman had not a right
<lb />to take a little pleasure, because he just happens to
	      <lb />owe you a little matters of money:  fie, fie, <persName>Mr. Hob&shy;
<lb />son</persName>!  I did not expect you to behave so despiseable!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Despiseable!</q> answered <persName>Mr. Hobson</persName>, <q>I'd scorn
<lb />as much to do any thing despiseable as yourself, or
<pb n="503" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">115</mw>
<lb />any thing misbecoming of a gentleman; and as to
<lb />coming to such a place as this may be, why I have no
<lb />objection to it.  All I stand to is this, let every man
<lb />have his due; for as to taking a little pleasure, here
<lb />I am, as one may say, doing the same myself; but
<lb />where's the harm of that? who's a right to call a man
<lb />to account that's clear of the world?  Not that I mean
<lb />to boast, nor nothing like it, but as I said before, <emph>five
<lb />times five is fifteen;&mdash;that's my calculation</emph>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, who, during this debate, had still con&shy;
<lb />tinued drinking, regardless of all opposition from his
<lb />wife and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, now grew more and more turbulent:
	    <lb />he insisted that <persName>Mr. Simkins</persName> should return to his seat,
<lb />ordered him another bumper of champagne, and say&shy;
<lb />ing he had not half company enough to raise his spi&shy;
<lb />rits, desired <persName>Morrice</persName> to go and invite more.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Morrice</persName>, always ready to promote a frolic, most
<lb />cheerfully consented; but when <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in a low
<lb />voice, supplicated him to bring no one back, with still
<lb />more readiness he made signs that he understood and
<lb />would obey her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> then began to sing, and in so noisy and
<lb />riotous a manner, that nobody approached the box
<lb />without stopping to stare at him; and those who were
<lb />new to such scenes, not contented with merely look&shy;
<lb />ing in, stationed themselves at some distance before
<lb />it, to observe what was passing, and to contemplate
<lb />with envy and admiration an appearance of mirth and
<lb />enjoyment which they attributed to happiness and
<lb />pleasure!</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, shocked to be seen in such mixed com&shy;
<lb />pany, grew every instant more restless and miserable;
<lb />and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, half distracted to think how they were to
<lb />get home, passed all her time in making secret vows
<pb n="504" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">116</mw>
<lb />that if once again she was delivered from <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />she would never see him more.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> perceiving their mutual uneasi&shy;
<lb />ness, proposed to escort them home himself; and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, notwithstanding her aversion to him, was
	    <lb />listening to the scheme, when <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, who had
<lb />been evidently provoked and disconcerted since the
<lb />junction of the Baronet, suspecting what was passing,
<lb />offered his services also, in a tone of voice that did not
<lb />promise a very quiet acquiescence in a refusal.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who, too easily, in their looks, saw all the
<lb />eagerness of rivalry, now dreaded the consequence of
<lb />her decision, and therefore declined the assistance of
<lb />either:  but her distress was unspeakable, as there was
<lb />not one person in the party to whose care she could
<lb />commit herself, though the behaviour of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />which every moment grew more disorderly, render&shy;
<lb />ed the necessity of quitting him urgent and uncontroul&shy;
<lb />able.</p>
<p><lb />When <persName>Morrice</persName> returned, stopping in the midst of
<lb />his loud and violent singing, he vehemently demanded
<lb />what company he had brought him?</p>
<p><lb /><q>None at all, Sir,</q> answered <persName>Morrice</persName>, looking
<lb />significantly at <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>I have really been so un&shy;
<lb />lucky as not to meet with any body who had a mind
<lb />to come.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why then,</q> answered he, starting up, <q>I will
<lb />seek some for myself.</q> <q>O no, pray, <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />bring nobody else,</q> cried his wife.  <q>Hear us in
<lb />pity,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>and distress us no further.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Distress you?</q> cried he, with quickness, <q>what,
<lb />shall I not bring you those pretty girls?  Yes, one
<lb />more glass, and I will teach you to welcome them.</q></p>
<p><lb />And he poured out another bumper.
<pb n="505" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">117</mw></p>
<p><lb /><q>This is so insupportable!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, rising,
<lb /><q>and I can remain here no longer.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>This is cruel indeed,</q> cried <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, burst&shy;
<lb />ing into tears; <q>did you only bring me here to insult
<lb />me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No!</q> cried he, suddenly embracing her, <q>by this
<lb />parting kiss!</q> then wildly jumping upon his seat, he
<lb />leapt over the table, and was out of sight in an instant.</p>
<p><lb />Amazement seized all who remained; <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>
<lb />and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, indeed, doubted not but he was actually
<lb />gone to the chaise he had ordered; but the manner of
<lb />his departure affrighted them, and his preceding beha&shy;
<lb />viour had made them cease to expect it:  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />leaning upon <persName>Cecilia</persName>, continued to weep, while she,
<lb />confounded and alarmed, scarce knew whether she
<lb />should stay and console her, or fly after <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />whom she feared had incapacitated himself from find&shy;
<lb />ing his chaise, by the very method he had taken to
<lb />gather courage for seeking it.</p>
<p><lb />This, however, was but the apprehension of a mo&shy;
<lb />ment; another and a far more horrible one drove it
<lb />from her imagination:  for scarcely had <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>
<lb />quitted the box and their sight, before their ears were
<lb />suddenly struck with the report of a pistol.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> gave a loud scream, which was invo&shy;
<lb />luntarily echoed by <persName>Cecilia</persName>:  every body arose, some
<lb />with officious zeal to serve the ladies, and others to
<lb />hasten to the spot whence the dreadful sound pro&shy;
<lb />ceeded.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> again offered his services in con&shy;
<lb />ducting them home; but they could listen to no such
<lb />proposal:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> with difficulty refrained from rush&shy;
<lb />ing out herself to discover what was passing; but her
<lb />dread of being followed by <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> prevented
<pb n="506" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">118</mw>
<lb />her; they both, therefore, waited, expecting every
<lb />instant some intelligence, as all but the Baronet and
	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> were now gone to seek it.</p>
<p><lb />Nobody, however, returned; and their terrors en&shy;
<lb />creased every moment:  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> wanted to run
<lb />out herself, but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, conjuring her to keep still,
<lb />begged <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> to bring them some account.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, like the messengers who had preceded
<lb />him, came not back:  an instant seemed an age, and
<lb /><persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName> was also entreated to procure in&shy;
<lb />formation.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> and <persName>Cecilia</persName> were now left to them&shy;
<lb />selves, and their horror was too great for speech or
<lb />motion:  they stood close to each other, listening to
<lb />every sound, and receiving every possible addition to
<lb />their alarm, by the general confusion which they ob&shy;
<lb />served in the gardens, in which, though both gentle&shy;
<lb />men and waiters were running to and fro, not a crea&shy;
<lb />ture was walking, and all amusement seemed for&shy;
<lb />gotten.</p>
<p><lb />From this dreadful state they were at length re&shy;
<lb />moved, though not relieved, by the sight of a waiter,
<lb />who, as he was passing, shewed himself almost covered
<lb />with blood!  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> vehemently called after him,
<lb />demanding whence it came?  <q>From the gentleman,
<lb />ma'am,</q> answered he in haste, <q>that has shot him&shy;
<lb />self,</q> and then ran on.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> uttered a piercing scream, and sunk
<lb />on the ground; for <persName>Cecilia</persName>, shuddering with horror,
<lb />lost all her own strength, and could no longer lend
<lb />her any support.</p>
<p><lb />So great at this time was the general confusion of
<lb />the place, that for some minutes their particular dis&shy;
<lb />tress was unknown, and their situation unnoticed;
<pb n="507" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">119</mw>
<lb />till at length an elderly gentleman came up to the
<lb />box, and humanely offered his assistance.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, pointing to her unfortunate friend, who had
<lb />not fallen into a fainting fit, but merely from weak&shy;
<lb />ness and terror, accepted his help in raising her.
<lb />She was lifted up, however, without the smallest effort
<lb />on her own part, and was only kept upon her seat by
<lb />being held their by the stranger, for <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose
<lb />whole frame was shaking, tried in vain to sustain her.
<lb />This gentleman, from the violence of their distress,
<lb />began now to suspect its motive, and addressing him&shy;
<lb />self to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, said, <q>I am afraid, madam, this un&shy;
<lb />fortunate gentleman was some relation to you?</q></p>
<p><lb />Neither of them spoke, but their silence was suffi&shy;
<lb />ciently expressive.</p>
<p><lb /><q>It is pity, madam,</q> he continued, <q>that some
<lb />friend can't order him out of the crowd, and have him
<lb />kept quiet till a surgeon can be brought.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A surgeon!</q> exclaimed <persName>Cecilia</persName>, recovering from
<lb />one surprize by the effect of another, <q>is it then pos&shy;
<lb />sible he may be saved?</q></p>
<p><lb />And without waiting to have her question answered,
<lb />she ran out of the box herself, flying wildly about the
<lb />garden, and calling for help as she flew, till she found
<lb />the house by the entrance; and then, going up to the
<lb />bar, <q>Is a surgeon sent for?</q> she exclaimed, <q>let a
<lb />surgeon be fetched instantly!</q> <q>A surgeon, ma'am,</q>
<lb />she was answered, <q>is not the gentleman dead?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no, no!</q> she cried; <q>he must be brought in;
<lb />let come careful people go and bring him in.</q>  Nor
<lb />would she quit the bar, till two or three waiters were
<lb />called, and received her orders.  And then, eager to
<lb />see them executed herself, she ran, fearless of being
<lb />alone, and without thought of being lost, towards the
<pb n="508" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="P4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">120</mw>
<lb />fatal spot whither the crowd guided her.  She could
<lb />not, indeed, have been more secure from insult or
<lb />molestation if surrounded by twenty guards; for the
<lb />scene of desperation and horror which many had wit&shy;
<lb />nessed, and of which all had heard the signal, en&shy;
<lb />grossed the universal attention, and took, even from
<lb />the most idle and licentious, all spirit for gallantry
<lb />and amusement.</p>
<p><lb />Here, while making vain attempts to penetrate
<lb />through the multitude, that she might see and herself
<lb />judge the actual situation of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, and give,
<lb />if yet there was room for hope, such orders as would
<lb />best conduce to his safety and recovery, she was met
<lb />by <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, who entreated her not to press for&shy;
<lb />ward to a sight which he had found too shocking for
<lb />himself, and insisted upon protecting her through the
<lb />crowd.</p>
<p><lb /><q>If he is alive,</q> cried she, refusing his aid, <q>and
<lb />if there is any chance he may be saved, no sight shall
<lb />be too shocking to deter me from seeing him pro&shy;
<lb />perly attended.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>All attendance,</q> answered he, <q>will be in vain:
<lb />he is not, indeed, yet dead, but his recovery is impos&shy;
<lb />sible.  There is a surgeon with him already; one
<lb />who happened to be in the gardesn, and he told me
<lb />himself that the wound was inevitably mortal.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though greatly disappointed, still deter&shy;
<lb />mined to make way to him, that she might herself en&shy;
<lb />quire if, in his last moments, there was any thing he
<lb />wished to communicate, or desire to have done:  but,
<lb />as she struggled to proceed, she was next met and
<lb />stopt by <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, who, forcing her back,
<lb />acquainted her that all was over!</p>
<p><lb />The shock with which she received this account,
<pb n="509" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">121</mw>
<lb />though unmixed with any tenderness of regret, and
<lb />resulting merely from general humanity, was yet so
<lb />violent as almost to overpower her.  <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, in&shy;
<lb />deed, had forfeited all right to her esteem, and the un&shy;
<lb />feeling selfishness of his whole behaviour had long
<lb />provoked her resentment and excited her disgust; yet
<lb />a catastrophe so dreadful, and from which she had
<lb />herself made such efforts to rescue him, filled her with
<lb />so much horror, that, turning extremely sick, she was
<lb />obliged to be supported to the nearest box, and stop
<lb />there for hartshorn and water.</p>
<p><lb />A few minutes, however, sufficed to divest her of
<lb />all care for herself, in the concern with which she
<lb />recollected the situation of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; she has&shy;
<lb />tened, therefore, back to her, attended by the Baronet
<lb />and <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, and found her still leaning upon
<lb />the stranger, and weeping aloud.</p>
<p><lb />The fatal news had already reached her; and
<lb />though all affection between <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> and herself
<lb />had mutually subsided from the first two or three
<lb />months of their marriage, a conclusion so horrible to
<lb />all connection between them could not be heard with&shy;
<lb />out sorrow and distress.  Her temper, too, naturally
<lb />soft, retained not resentment, and <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, now
<lb />separated from her for ever, was only remembered as
<lb />the <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> who first won her heart.</p>
<p><lb />Neither pains nor tenderness were spared on the
<lb />part of <persName>Cecilia</persName> to console her; who finding her utterly
<lb />incapable either of acting or directing for herself, and
<lb />knowing her at all times to be extremely helpless, now
<lb />summoned to her own aid all the strength of mind she
<lb />possessed, and determined upon this melancholy occa&shy;
<lb />sion, both to think and act for her widowed friend to
<lb />the utmost stretch of her abilities and power.

<p><lb />As soon, therefore, as the first effusions of her grief
<lb />were over, she prevailed with her to go to the house,
<lb />where she was humanely offered the use of a quiet
<lb />room till she should be better able to set off for town.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, having seen her thus safely lodged, begged
<lb /><persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> to stay with her, and then, accompanied
<lb />by the Baronet, returned herself to the bar, and
<lb />desiring the footman who had attended them to be
<lb />called, sent him instantly to his late master, and pro&shy;
<lb />ceeded next with great presence of mind, to inquire
<lb />further into the particulars of what had passed, and
<lb />to consult upon what was immediately to be done with
<lb />the deceased:  for she thought it neither decent nor
<lb />right to leave to chance or to strangers the last duties
<lb />which could be paid him.</p>
<p><lb />He had lingered, she found, about a quarter of an
<lb />hour, but in a condition too dreadful for description,
<lb />quite speechless, and, by all that could be judged, out
<lb />of his senses; yet so distorted with pain, and wounded
<lb />so desperately beyond any power of relief, that the
<lb />surgeon, who every instant expected his death, said
<lb />it would not merely be useless but inhuman to remove
<lb />him till had breathed his last.  He died, therefore,
<lb />in the arms of this gentleman and a waiter.</p>
<p><lb />Whither the body was to be removed was the next
<lb />question to be considered.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> wished the removal to be directly to the
	    <lb />town-house, but <persName>Sir Robert</persName> told her it must be carried
<lb />to the nearest undertaker's, and kept there till it could
<lb />be conveyed to town in a coffin.</p>
<p><lb />For this, also, in the name of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, she gave
<lb />directions.</p>
<p><lb />Her next solicitude was how they should return to
<lb />town:  they had no equipage of their own, and the
<pb n="511" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">123</mw>
<lb />only servant who came with them was employed in
<lb />performing the last duties for his deceased master.
<lb />Her first intention was to order a hackney coach, but
<lb />the deplorable state of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> made it almost
<lb />impossible she could take the sole care of her, and the
<lb />lateness of the night, and their distance from home,
<lb />gave her a dread invincible to going so far without
<lb />some guard or assistant.  <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> earnestly de&shy;
<lb />sired to have the honour of conveying them to Port&shy;
<lb />man-square in his own carriage, and notwithstanding
<lb />there were many objections to such a proposal, the
<lb />humanity of his behaviour upon the present occasion,
<lb />and the evident veneration which accompanied his
<lb />passion, joined to her encreasing aversion to the Ba&shy;
<lb />ronet, from whom she could not endure to receive the
<lb />smallest obligation, determined her, after much per&shy;
<lb />plexity and hesitation, to accept his offer.</p>
<p><lb />She begged him, therefore, to immediately to
<lb />order his coach, and, happy to obey her, he went out
<lb />with that design; but, instantly coming back, told
<lb />her, in a low voice, that they must wait some time
<lb />longer, as the undertaker's people were then entering
<lb />the garden, and if they stayed not till the removal had
<lb />taken place, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> might be shocked with the
<lb />sight of some of the men, or perhaps even meet the
<lb />dead body.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, thanking him for this considerate precau&shy;
<lb />tion, readily agreed to defer setting out; devoting,
<lb />mean time, all her attention to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, whose
<lb />sorrow, though violent, forbad not consolation.  But
<lb />before the garden was cleared, and the carriage or&shy;
	    <lb />dered, <persName>Sir Robert</persName> returned; saying to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with
<lb />an air of parading obedience, which seemed to claim
<pb n="512" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">124</mw>
<lb />some applause, <q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, your commands have
<lb />been executed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> made not any answer, and he presently
<lb />added <q>whenever you chuse to go, I will order up
<lb />my coach.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>My coach, Sir,</q> said <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, <q>will be or&shy;
<lb />dered when the ladies are ready, and I hope to have
<lb />the honour myself of conducting them to town.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir,</q> cried the Baronet, <q>that can never be;
<lb />my long acquaintance with <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> gives me a
<lb />prior right to attend her, and I can by no means suffer
<lb />any other person to rob me of it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I have nothing,</q> said <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, <q>to say to
<lb />that, Sir; but <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> herself has done me the
<lb />honour to consent to make use of my carriage.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I think,</q> said Sir Robert, ex&shy;
<lb />tremely piqued, <q>can never have sent me out of the
<lb />way in order to execute her own commands, merely
<lb />to deprive me of the pleasure of attending her and
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> home.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, somewhat alarmed, now sought to lessen
<lb />the favour of her decision, though she adhered to it
<lb />without wavering.</p>
<p><lb /><q>My intention,</q> said she, <q>was not to confer, but
	      <lb />to receive an abligation; and I had hoped, while <persName>Mr.
		<lb />Marriot</persName> assisted us, <persName>Sir Robert</persName> would be far more
<lb />humanely employed in taking charge of what we can&shy;
<lb />not superintend, and yet are infinitely more anxious
<lb />should not be neglected.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>That,</q> said <persName>Sir Robert</persName>, <q>is all done; and I
<lb />hope, therefore, after sending me upon such an er&shy;
<lb />rand, you don't mean to refuse me the pelasure of
<lb />seeing you to town?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Sir Robert,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, greatly displeased, <q>I
<pb n="513" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">125</mw>
<lb />cannot argue with you now; I have already settled
<lb />my plan, and I am not at leisure to re-consider it.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName> bit his lips for a moment in angry si&shy;
<lb />lence; but not enduring to lose the victory to a young
<lb />rival he despised, he presently said, <q>If I must talk
<lb />no more about it to you, madam, I must at least beg
<lb />leave to talk of it to this gentleman, and take the li&shy;
<lb />berty to represent to him&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now, dreading how his speech might be
<lb />answered, prevented its being finished, and with an
<lb />air of the most spirited dignity, said, <q>Is it possible,
<lb />Sir, that at a time such as this, you should not be
<lb />wholly indifferent to a matter so frivolous! little in&shy;
<lb />deed will be the pleasure which our society can afford!
<lb />your dispute, however, has given it some importance,
<lb />and therefore <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName> must accept my thanks for
<lb />his civility, and excuse me for retracting my consent.</q></p>
<p><lb />Supplications and remonstrances were, however,
<lb />still poured upon her from both, and the danger, the
<lb />impossibility that two ladies could go to town alone,
<lb />in a hackney coach, and without even a servant, at
<lb />near four o'clock in the morning, they mutually urged,
<lb />vehemently entreating that she would run no hazard.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, was far other than insensible to these re&shy;
<lb />presentations; the danger, indeed, appeared to her
<lb />so formidable, that her inclination the whole time
<lb />opposed her refusal; yet her repugnance to giving
<lb />way to the overbearing Baronet, and her fear of his
<lb />resentment if she listened to <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, forced her
<lb />to be steady, since she saw that her preference would
<lb />prove the signal of a quarrel.</p>
<p><lb />Inattentive, therefore, to their joint persecution,
<lb />she again deliberated by what possible method she
<lb />could get home in safety; but unable to devise any,
<pb n="514" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">126</mw>
<lb />she at last resolved to make enquiries of the people
<lb />in the bar, who had been extremely humane and civil,
<lb />whether they could assist or counsel her.  She there&shy;
	    <lb />fore desired the two gentlemen to take care of <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, to which neither dared dissent, as both could
<lb />not refuse, and hastily arising, went out of the room:
<lb />but great indeed was her surprize when, as she was
<lb />walking up to the bar, she was addres<sic corr="s"></sic>ed by young
<lb />Delvile!</p>
<p><lb />Approaching her with that air of gravity and dis&shy;
<lb />tance which of late he had assumed in her presence,
<lb />he was beginning some speech about his mother; but
<lb />the instant the sound of his voice reached <persName>Cecilia</persName>, she
<lb />joyfully clasped her hands, and eagerly exclaimed,
<lb /><q><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>!&mdash;O now we are safe!&mdash;this is fortu&shy;
<lb />nate indeed!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Safe, madam,</q> cried he, astonished, <q>yes, I hope
<lb />so!&mdash;Has any thing endangered your safety?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O no matter for danger,</q> cried she, <q>we will
<lb />now trust ourselves with you, and I am sure you will
<lb />protect us.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Protect you!</q> repeated he again, and with
<lb />warmth, <q>yes, while I live!&mdash;But what is the matter?
<lb />&mdash;why are you so pale?&mdash;are you ill?&mdash;are you
<lb />frightened?&mdash;what is the matter?</q></p>
<p><lb />And losing all coldness and reserve, with the ut&shy;
<lb />most earnestness he begged her to explain herself.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Do you not know,</q> cried she, <q>what has hap&shy;
<lb />pened?  Can you be here, and not have heard it?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Heard what?</q> cried he; <q>I am but this moment
<lb />arrived:  my mother grew uneasy that she did not see
<lb />you; she sent to your house, and was told that you
	      <lb />were not returned from <placeName>Vauxhall</placeName>; some other cir&shy;
<lb />cumstances also alarmed her, and therefore, late as it
<pb n="515" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">127</mw>
<lb />was, I came hither myself.  The instant I entered
<lb />this place, I saw you here.  This is all my history;
<lb />tell me now yours.  Where is your party? where are
	      <lb /><persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>?  Why are you alone?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O ask not!</q> cried she, <q>I cannot tell you!&mdash;take
<lb />us but under your care, and you will soon know all
<lb /><sic corr="!">?</sic></q></p>
<p>	    <lb />She then hurried from him, and returning to <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName>, said she had now a conveyance at once safe
<lb />and proper, and begged her to rise and come away.</p>
<p><lb />The gentlemen, however, rose first, each of them
<lb />declaring he would himself attend them.</p>
<p><lb /><q>No,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, steadily, <q>that trouble will
<lb />now be superfluous; <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> herself has sent
<lb />for me, and her son is now waiting till we join him.</q></p>
<p><lb />Amazement and disappointment at this intelligence
<lb />were visible in the faces of them both:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> waited
<lb />not a single question, but finding she was unable to
<lb />support <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, who rather suffered herself to
<lb />be carried than led, she entrusted her between them,
	    <lb />and ran forward to enquire of <persName>Delvile</persName> if his carriage
<lb />was ready.</p>
<p><lb />She found him with a look of horror that told the
<lb />tale he had been hearing, listening to one of the wai&shy;
<lb />ters:  the moment she appeared, he flew to her, and
	    <lb />with the utmost emotion exclaimed, <q>Amiable <persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>! what a dreadful scene have you witnessed!
<lb />what a cruel task have you nobly performed! such
<lb />spirit with such softness!  But you are all excellence!
<lb />human nature can rise no higher!  I believe indeed
<lb />you are its most perfect ornament!</q></p>
<p><lb />Praise such as this, so unexpected, and delivered
<lb />with such energy, <persName>Cecilia</persName> heard not without pleasure,
<lb />even at a moment when her whle mind was occupied
<lb />matters foreign to its peculiar interests.  She
<pb n="516" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Q4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">128</mw>
<lb />made, however, her enquiry about the carriage, and
<lb />he told her that he had come in a hackney coach,
<lb />whcih was waiting for him at the door.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was now brought in, and little was the
<lb />recompense her assistants received for their aid, when
<lb />they saw <persName>Cecilia</persName> so contentedly engaged with young
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, whose eyes were rivetted on her face, with
<lb />an expression of the most lively admiration:  each,
<lb />however then quitted the other, and hastened to the
<lb />fair mourner; no time was now lost, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was
<lb />suported to the coach, <persName>Cecilia</persName> followed her, and
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, jumping in after them, ordered the man to
	    <lb />drive to <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Sir Robert</persName> and <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>, confounded though
<lb />enraged, saw their departure in passive silence:  the
<lb />right of attendance they had so tenaciously denied to
	    <lb />each other, here admitted not of dispute:  <persName>Delvile</persName>
<lb />upon this occasion appeared as the representative of
<lb />his father, and his authority seemed the authority of a
<lb />guardian.  Their only consolation was, that neither
<lb />had yielded to the other, and all spirit of altercation
<lb />or revenge was sunk in their mutual mortificaiton.
<lb />At the petition of the waiters, from sullen but proud
<lb />emulation, they paid the expences of the night; and
<lb />then throwing themselves into their carriages, returned
<lb />to their respective houses.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />During the ride to town, not merely <persName>Cecilia</persName>, but
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> himself attended wholly to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<pb n="517" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">129</mw>
<lb />whose grief, as it became less violent, was more easy
<lb />to be soothed.</p>
<p><lb />The distress of this eventful night was however not
	    <lb />yet over; when they came to <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, Del&shy;
<lb />vile eagerly called to the coachman not to drive up to
	    <lb />the house, and anxiously begged <persName>Cecilia</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Harrel</persName> to sit still, while he went out himself to make
<lb />some enquiries.  They were surprised at the request,
<lb />yet immediately consented; but before he had quitted
	    <lb />them, <persName>Davison</persName>, who was watching their return, came
<lb />up to them with information that an execution was
<lb />then in the house.</p>
<p><lb />Fresh misery was now opened for <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, and
<lb />fresh horror and perplexity for <persName>Cecilia</persName>.  She had no
<lb />longer, however, the whole weight either of thought
	    <lb />or of conduct upon herself; <persName>Delvile</persName> in her cares took
<lb />the most animated interest; and beseeching her to
<lb />wait a moment and appease her friend, he went him&shy;
<lb />self into the house to learn the state of the affair.</p>
<p><lb />He returned in a few minutes, and seemed in no
<lb />haste to communicate what he had heard, but entreat&shy;
	    <lb />ed them both to go immediately to <placeName>St. James's-square</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> felt extremely fearful of offending his father
<lb />by the introduction of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>; yet she had no&shy;
<lb />thing better to propose, and therefore, after a short
<lb />and distressed argument, she complied.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> then told her that the alarm of his mother,
<lb />at which he had already hinted, proceeded from a
<lb />rumour of this very misfortune, to which, though
<lb />they knew not whether they might give credit, was
<lb />owing the anxiety which at so late an hour, had in&shy;
	    <lb />duced him to go to <placeName>Vauxhall</placeName> in search of her.</p>
<p><lb />They gained admittance without any disturbance,
<lb />as the servant of young <persName>Delvile</persName> had been ordered to
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">22.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">R</mw>
<pb n="518" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">130</mw>
<lb />sit up for his master.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> much disliked thus
<lb />taking possession of the house in the night-time,
	    <lb />though <persName>Delvile</persName>, solicitous to relieve her, desired she
<lb />would not waste a thought upon the subject, and
<lb />making his servant shew her the room which had been
<lb />prepared for her reception, he begged her to compose
<lb />her spirits, and to comfort her friend, and promised to
<lb />acquaint his father and mother, when they arose, with
<lb />what had happened, that she might be saved all pain
<lb />from surprise or curiosity when they met.</p>
<p><lb />This service she thankfully accepted, for she dread&shy;
<lb />ed, after the liberty she had taken, to encounter the
<lb />pride of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> without some previous apology;
<lb />and she feared still more to see his lady without the
<lb />same preparation, as her frequent breach of appoint&shy;
<lb />ment might reasonably have offended her, and as her
<lb />displeasure would affect her more deeply.</p>
<p><lb />It was now near six o'clock, yet the hours seemed as
<lb />long as they were melancholy till the family arose.
<lb />They settled to remain quiet till some message was
<lb />sent to them; but before any arrived, <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />who was seated upon the bed, wearied by fatigue and
<lb />sorrow, cried herself to sleep like a child.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> rejoiced in seeing this reprieve from afflic&shy;
<lb />tion, though her keener sensations unfitted her from
<lb />partaking of it.  Much indeed was the uneasiness
<lb />which kept her awake, the care of <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> seemed
<lb />to devolve upon herself, the reception she might meet
	    <lb />from the <name>Delviles</name> was uncertain, and the horrible ad&shy;
<lb />ventures of the night refused for a moment to quit her
<lb />remembrance.</p>
<p>	    <lb />At ten o'clock, a message was brought from <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, to know whether they were ready for break&shy;
<lb />fast.</p>
<pb n="519" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">131</mw>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> was still asleep, but <persName>Cecilia</persName> carried her
<lb />own answer by hastening down stairs.</p>
<p><lb />In her way she was met by young <persName>Delvile</persName>, whose
<lb />air, upon first approaching her, spoke him again pre&shy;
<lb />pared to address her with the most distant gravity:
<lb />but almost the moment he looked at her, he forgot his
<lb />purpose; her paleness, the heaviness of her eyes, and
<lb />the fatigue of long watching betrayed by her whole
<lb />face, again surprised him into all the tenderness of
<lb />anxiety, and he enquired after her health not as a
<lb />compliment of civility, but as a question in which his
<lb />whole heart was most deeply interest.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> thanked him for his attention to her friend
<lb />the night before, and then proceeded to his mother.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, coming forward to meet her, removed
<lb />at once all her fears of displeasure, and banished all
<lb />necessity of apology, by instantly embracing her, and
<lb />warmly exclaiming, <q>Charming <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>! how
<lb />shall I ever tell you half the admiration with which
<lb />I have heard of your conduct!  The exertion of so
<lb />much fortitude, at a juncture when a weaker mind
<lb />would have been overpowered by terror, and a heart
<lb />less under the dominion of well regulated principles,
<lb />would have sought only its own relief by flying from
<lb />distress and confusion, shows such <emph>propriety of mind</emph>,
<lb />as can only result from the union of good sense with
<lb />virtue.  You are indeed a noble creature!  I thought
<lb />so from the moment I beheld you; I shall think so,
<lb />I hope, to the last that I live!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, penetrated with joy and gratitude, felt in
<lb />that instant the amplest recompense for all that she
<lb />had suffered, and for all that she had lost.  Such praise
<lb />from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> was alone sufficient to make her
<lb />happy:  but when she considered whence it sprung, and
<pb n="520" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">132</mw>
<lb />that the circumstances with which she was so much
<lb />struck, must have been related to her by her son, her
<lb />delight was augmented to an emotion the most pleasing
<lb />she could experience, from seeing how high she was
<lb />held in the esteem of those<sic corr="&amp;blank;"></sic>who were highest in her
<lb />own.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, then with the utmost cordiality,
<lb />began to talk of her affairs, saving her the pain of pro&shy;
<lb />posing the change of habitaiton that now seemed un&shy;
<lb />avoidable, by an immediate invitation to her house,
	    <lb />which she made with as much delicacy as if <persName>Mr. Har&shy;
<lb />rel's</persName> had still been open to her, and choice, not neces&shy;
<lb />sity, had directed her removal.  The whole family,
<lb />she told her, went into the country in two days; and
<lb />she hoped that a new scene, with quietness and early
<lb />hours, would restore both the bloom and sprightliness
<lb />which her late cares and restlessness had injured.
<lb />And though she very seriously lamented the rash
<lb />action of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, she much rejoiced in the acqui&shy;
<lb />sition which her own house and happiness would re&shy;
<lb />ceive from her society.</p>
<p><lb />She next discussed the situation of her widowed
<lb />friend, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> produced the packet which had
	    <lb />been entrusted to her by her late husband.  <persName>Mrs.
	      <lb />Delvile</persName> advised her to open it in the presence of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName>, and begged her to send for any other of her
<lb />friends she might wish to see or consult, and to claim
<lb />freely from herself whatever advice or assistance she
	    <lb />could bestow.  And then, without waiting for <persName>Mr.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, she suffered her to swallow a hasty breakfast,
<lb />and return to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, whom she had desired the
<lb />servants to attend, as she concluded that in her pre&shy;
<lb />sent situation she would not choose to make her ap&shy;
<lb />pearance.</p>
<pb n="521" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">133</mw>
<p>
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, lightened now from all her own cares,
<lb />more pleased than ever with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, and en&shy;
<lb />chanted that at last she was settled under her roof,
<lb />went back with as much ability as inclination, to give
<lb />comfort to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>.  She found her but just
<lb />awaking, and scarce yet conscious where she was, or
<lb />why not in her own house.</p>
<p><lb />As her powers of recollection returned, she was
<lb />soothed with the softest compassion by <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who,
<lb />in pursuance of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>'s advice, sent her ser&shy;
<lb />vant in search of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, and in consequence of
<lb />her permission, wrote a note of invitation to <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, who was already in town, soon arrived;
<lb />his own man, whom he had left to watch the motions
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, having early in the morning rode to
<lb />the place of his retreat, with the melancholy tidings of
<lb />the suicide execution.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> instantly went down stairs to him.  The
	    <lb />meeting was extremely painful to them both.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Arnott</persName> severely blamed himself for his flight, be&shy;
<lb />lieving it had hastened the fatal blow, which some
<lb />further sacrifices might perhaps have eluded; and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> half repented the advice she had given him,
<lb />though the failure of her own efforts proved the situ&shy;
<lb />ation of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> too desperate for remedy.</p>
<p><lb />He then made the tenderest enquiries about his
<lb />sister, and entreated her to communicate to him the
<lb />minutest particulars of the dreadful transaction:  after
<lb />which, she produced the packet, but netiher of them
<lb />had the courage to break the seal; and concluding
<lb />the contents would be no less than his last will, they
<lb />determined some third person should be present when
	    <lb />they opened it.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> wished much for <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<pb n="522" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">134</mw>
<lb />ton</persName>, but as his being immediately found was uncertain,
<lb />and the packet might consist of orders which ought
<lb />not to be delayed, she proposed, for the sake of expe&shy;
<lb />dition, to call in <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> readily agreed, and she sent to beg a
<lb />moment's audience with that gentleman.</p>
<p><lb />She was desired to walk into the breakfast-room,
<lb />where he was sitting with his lady and his son.</p>
<p><lb />Not such was now her reception as when she en&shy;
<lb />tered that apartment before.  <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> looked
<lb />displeased and out of humour, and, making her a stiff
<lb />bow, while his son brought her a chair, coldly said, <q>If
<lb />you are hurried, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I will attend you
<lb />directly; if not, I will finish my breakfast, as I shall
<lb />have but little time the rest of the morning, from the
<lb />concourse of people upon business, who will croud
<lb />upon me till dinner, most of whom will be extremely
<lb />distressed if I leave town without contriving to see
<lb />them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE302">There is not the least occasion, Sir,</q> answered
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE303">that I should trouble you to quit the room:
<lb />I merely came to beg you would have the goodness
<lb />to be present, while <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> opens a small packet
	      <lb />which was last night put into my hands by <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="DE88">And has <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,</q> answered he, somewhat
<lb />sternly, <q id="DE89">thought proper to send me such a request?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE304">No, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE305">the request is mine;
<lb />and if, as I now fear, it is impertinent, I must entreat
<lb />you to forget it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="DE90">As far as relates merely to myself,</q> returned Mr.
<lb />Delvile, <q id="DE91">it is another matter; but certainly Mr.
<lb />Arnott can have no possible claim upon my time or
<lb />attention; and I think it rather extraordinary, that a
<pb n="523" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">135</mw>
<lb />young man with whom I have no sort of connection
<lb />or commerce, and whose very name is almost unknown
<lb />to me, should suppose a person in my stile of life
<lb />so little occupied as to be wholly at his command.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE306">He had no such idea, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, greatly
<lb />disconcerted; <q id="CE307">the honour of your presence is mere&shy;
<lb />ly solicited by myself, and simply from the apprehen&shy;
<lb />sion that some directions may be contained in the
<lb />papers, which, perhaps, ought immediately to be
<lb />executed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="DE92">I am not, I repeat,</q> said <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, more
<lb />mildly, <q id="DE93">displeased at your part of this transaction;
<lb />your want of exerience and knowledge of the world
<lb />makes you not at all aware of the consequences which
<lb />may follow my compliance:  the papers you speak
<lb />of may perhaps be of great importance, and hereafter
<lb />the first witness<sic corr="">s</sic>es to their being read may be publicly
<lb />called upon.  You know not the trouble such an
<lb />affair may occasion, but <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> ought to be better informed.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, making another apology for the error which
<lb />she had committed, was in no small confusion quitting
<lb />the room; but <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, perfectly appeased by
<lb />seeing her distress, stopt her, to say, with much gra&shy;
<lb />ciousness, <q>For your sake, <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I am
<lb />sorry I cannot act in this business; but you see how
<lb />I am situated! overpowered with affairs of my own,
<lb />and people who can do nothing without my orders.
<lb />Besides, should there heareafter be any investigation
<lb />into the matter, my name might, perhaps, be mention&shy;
<lb />ed; and it would be superfluous to say how ill I
<lb />shuld think it used by being brought into such com&shy;
<lb />pany.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then left the room secretly vowing that no
<pb n="524" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="R4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">136</mw>
<lb />possible exigence should in future tempt her to apply
<lb />for assistance to <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, which, however ostenta&shy;
<lb />tiously offerd, was constantly withheld when claimed.</p>
<p><lb />She was beginning to communicate to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>
<lb />her ill success, when young <persName>Delvile</persName>, with an air of
<lb />eagerness, followed her into the room.  <q>Pardon me,</q>
<lb />he cried, <q>for this intrusion,&mdash;but tell me, is it im&shy;
<lb />possible that in this affair I can represent my father?
<lb />may not the office you meant for him, devolve upon
<lb />me? remember how near we are to each other, and
<lb />honour me for once with supposing us the same.</q></p>
<p><lb />Ah who, or what, though <persName>Cecilia</persName>, can be so diffe&shy;
<lb />rent!  She thanked him, with much sweetness, for
<lb />his offer, but declined accepting it, saying, <q>I will
<lb />not, now I know the inconveniences of my request,
<lb />be so selfish as even to suffer it should be granted.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO61">You must not deny me,</q> cried he; <q id="MO62">where is
<lb />the packet? why should you lose a moment?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE308">Rather ask,</q> answered she, <q id="CE309">why I should per&shy;
<lb />mit <emph>you</emph> to lose a moment in a matter that does not
<lb />concern you? and to risk, perhaps, the loss of many
<lb />moments hereafter, from a too incautious politeness?</q>
<lb /><q id="MO63">And what can I risk,</q> cried he, <q id="MO64">half so precious
<lb />as your smallest satisfaction?  Do you suppose I can
<lb />flatter myself with a possibility of contributing to it,
<lb />and yet have the resoltuion to refuse myself so much
<lb />pleasure?  No, no, the heroic times are over, and
<lb />self-denial is no longer in fashion!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE310">You are very good,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q id="CE311">but indeed
<lb />after what has passed&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="DE94">No matter for what has passed,</q> interrupted he,
<lb /><q id="DE95">we are now to think of what is to come.  I know
<lb />you too well to doubt your impatience in the execu&shy;
<lb />tion of a commission which circumstances have ren&shy;
<pb n="525" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">137</mw>
<lb />dered sacred; and should any thing either be done
<lb />or omitted contrary to the directions in your packet,
<lb />will you not be apt, blameless as you are, to disturb
<lb />yourself with a thousand fears that you took not pro&shy;
<lb />per methods for the discharge of your trust?</q></p>
<p><lb />There was something in his earnestness so like his
<lb />former behaviour, and so far removed from his late
<lb />reserve, that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who perceived it with a pleasure
<lb />she could hardly disguise, now opposed him no longer,
<lb />but took up the packet, and broke the seal.</p>
<p><lb />And then, to her no small amazement, instead of
<lb />the expected will, she found a roll of enormous bills,
<lb />and a colleciton of letters from various creditors,
<lb />threatening the utmost severity of the law, if their
<lb />demands were longer unanswered.</p>
<p><lb />Upon a slip of paper which held these together,
<lb />was written, in <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s hand,
<q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">
<lb rend="align(center)" />To be all paid to-night with a <emph rend="case(smallcaps)">Bullet</emph>.</q></p>
<p><lb />Next appeared two letters of another sort; the
<lb />first of which was from <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>, and in
<lb />these words:</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-09"><body>
<div type="letter">
<p>Sir, As all prospects are now over of the alliance,
<lb />I hope you will excuse my reminding you of the

<lb />honour to be, Sir, Yours,</p>

<p>
<lb />The other was from <persName>Mr. Marriot</persName>.</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-10"><body>
<div type="letter">
<p>Sir, Though I should think &pound;2000 nothing for the
<lb />smallest hope, I must take the liberty to say I think
<lb />it a great deal for ten munutes:  you can't have forgot

<p>
<lb />What a scene of fraud, double dealing, and iniquity
<lb />was here laid open!  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who at first meant to
<lb />read everything aloud, found the attempt utterly
<lb />vain, for so much was she shocked, that she could
<lb />hardly read on to herself.</p>
<p><lb />Last of all appeared a paper in <persName>Mr. Harrel's</persName> own
<lb />hand-writing, containing these words:</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-11"><body>
<div type="letter">
<salute rend="align(center)">For <persName rend="case(smallcaps)">Mrs. Harrel<sic corr="">l</sic></persName>,

<p>
<lb />I can struggle no longer, the last blow must now
<lb />be struck! another day robs me of my house and my
<lb />liberty, and blasts me by the fatal discovery of my
<lb />double attempts.</p>
<p><lb />This is what I have wished; wholly to be freed, or
<lb />ruined past all resource, and driven to the long-pro&shy;
<lb />jected remedy.</p>
<p><lb />A burthen has my existence been these two years,
<lb />gay as I have appeared; not a night have I gone to
<lb />bed, but heated and inflamed from a gaming table;
<lb />not a morning have I awaked, but to be soured with
<lb />a dun!</p>
<p><lb />I would not lead such a life again, if the slave who
<lb />works hardest at the oar would change with me.</p>
<p><lb />Had I a son, I would bequeath him a plough; I
<lb />should then leave him happier than my parents left
<lb />me.</p>

<p>
<lb />Idleness has been my destruction; the want of
<lb />something to do led me into all evil.</p>
<p><lb />A good wife perhaps might have saved me&mdash;mine,
<lb />I thank her! tried not.  Disengaged from me and
<lb />my affairs, her own pleasures and amusements have
<lb />occupied her solely.  Dreadful will be the catastrophe
<lb />she will see to-night; let her bring it home, and live
<lb />better!</p>
<p><lb />If any pity is felt for me, it will be where I have
<lb />least deserved it!  <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>&mdash;<persName>Miss Beverley</persName>! it will
<lb />come from you!</p>
<p><lb />To bring myself to this final resolution, hard, I
<lb />confess, have been my conflicts:  it is not that I have
<lb />feared death, no, I have long wished it, for shame
<lb />and dread have embittered my days; but something
<lb />there is within me that causes a deeper horror,&mdash;that
<lb />asks my preparation for another world! that demands
<lb />my authority for quitting this!&mdash;what may be here&shy;
<lb />after&mdash;O terrible!&mdash;&mdash;Pray for me, generous Miss

<p>
<lb />Wretch as <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> appeared, without religion,
<lb />principle, or honour, this incoherent letter, evidently
<lb />written in the desperate moment of determined suicide,
<lb />very much affected both <persName>Cecilia</persName> and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>; and
<lb />in spite either of abhorrence or resentment, they mu&shy;
<lb />tually shed tears over the address to themselves.</p>
<p><lb />Delvile, to whom every part of the affair was new,
<lb />could only consider these papers as so many specimens
<lb />of guilt and infamy; he read them, therefore, with
<lb />astonishment and detestation, and openly congratula&shy;
<lb />ted <persName>Cecilia</persName> upon having escaped the double snares that
<lb />were spread for her.</p>
<p><lb />While this was passing, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> arrived;
<pb n="528" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">140</mw>
<lb />who felt but little satisfaction from beholding the lady
<lb />of his heart in confidential discourse with two of his
<lb />rivals, one of whom had long attacked her by the
<lb />dangerous flattery of perseverance, and the other
<lb />without any attack, had an influence yet more power&shy;
<lb />ful.</p>
<p><lb />Delvile, having performed the office for which he
<lb />came, concluded, upon the entrance of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
<lb />that <persName>Cecilia</persName> had nothing further to wish from him; for
<lb />her long acquaintance with that gentleman, his being
<lb />a <emph>married man</emph>, and her neighbour in the country, were
<lb />circumstances well known to him:  he merely, there&shy;
<lb />fore, enquired if she would honour him with any com&shy;
<lb />mands, and upon her assuring him she had none, he
<lb />quietly withdrew.</p>
<p><lb />This was no little relief to <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, into
<lb />whose hands <persName>Cecilia</persName> then put the fatal packet; and
<lb />while he was reading it, at the desire of <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>,
<lb />she went up stairs to prepare <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> for his ad&shy;
<lb />mission.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, unused to solitude, and as eager for
<lb />company when unhappy to console, as when easy to
<lb />divert her, consented to receive him with pleasure:
<lb />they both wept at the meeting; and <persName>Cecilia</persName>, after some
<lb />words of general comfort, left them together.</p>
<p><lb />She had then a very long and circumstantial con&shy;
<lb />versation with <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who explained whatever
<lb />had appeared dark in the writings left by <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>,
<lb />and who came to her before he saw them, with full
<lb />knowledge of what they contained.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> had contracted with <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>
<lb />a large debt of honour, before the arrival in town of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>; and having no power to discharge it, he pro&shy;
<lb />mised that the prize he expected in his ward should
<pb n="529" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">141</mw>
<lb />fall to his share, upon condition that the debt was
<lb />cancelled.</p>
<p><lb />Nothing was thought more easy than to arrange this
<lb />business, for the Baronet was always to be in her way,
<lb />and the report of the intended alliance was to keep off
<lb />all other pretenders.  Several times, however, her
<lb />coldness made him think the matter hopeless; and
<lb />when he received her letter, he would have given up
<lb />the whole affair:  but <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, well knowing his
<lb />inability to satisfy the claims that would follow such a
<lb />defection, constantly persuaded him the reserve was
<lb />affected, and that his own pride and want of assiduity
<lb />occasioned all her discouragement.</p>
<p><lb />But while thus, by amusing the Baronet with false
<lb />hopes, he kept off his demands, those of others were
<lb />not less clamorous:  his debts increased, his power of
<lb />paying them diminished; he grew sour and desperate,
<lb />and in one night lost 3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l.</term> beyond what he could
<lb />produce, or offer any security for.</p>
<p><lb />This, as he said, was <emph>what he wished;</emph> and now he
<lb />was, for the present, to extricate himself by doubling
<lb />stakes and winning, or to force himself into suicide by
<lb />doubling such a loss.  For though, with tolerable ease,
<lb />he could forget accounts innumerable with his trades&shy;
<lb />men, one neglected <emph>debt of honour</emph> rendered his exis&shy;
<lb />tence insupportable<sic corr=".">;</sic></p>
<p><lb />For this last great effort, his difficulty was to raise
<lb />the 3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l.</term> already due, without which the proposal
<lb />could not be made; and, after various artifices and
	    <lb />attempts, he at length contrived a meeting with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Marriot</persName>, intreated him to lend him 2000<term rend="slant(italic)">l.</term> for only two
<lb />days, and offered his warmest services in his favour
<lb />with <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />The rash and impassioned young man, deceived by
<pb n="530" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">142</mw>
<lb />his accounts into believing that his ward was wholly at
<lb />his disposal, readily advanced the money, without any
<lb />other condition than that of leave to visit freely at his
<lb />house, to the exclusion of <persName>Sir Robert Floyer</persName>.  <q id="MN33">The
	      <lb />other 1000<term rend="slant(italic)">l.</term></q> continued <persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Monckton</persName>,
<q id="MN34">I know not
<lb />how he obtained, but he certainly had three.  You, I
<lb />hope, were not so unguarded&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q id="CE312">Ah, <persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Monckton</persName>,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<q id="CE313">blame me not
<lb />too severely! the attacks that were made,&mdash;the necessi&shy;
<lb />ty of otherwise betraying the worthy and half-ruined
	      <lb /><persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Arnott</persName>&mdash;.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN35">Oh! fie!</q> cried he, <q id="MN36">to suffer <emph>your</emph> understanding
	      <lb />to be lulled asleep, because the weak-minded <persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Ar&shy;
<lb />nott's</persName> could not be kept awake!  I thought, after such
<lb />cautions from me, and such experience of your own,
<lb />you could not again have been thus duped.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE314">I thought so too,</q> answered she; <q id="CE315">but yet when
<lb />the trial came on,&mdash;indeed you know not how I was
<lb />persecuted.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN37">Yet you see,</q> returned he, <q id="MN38">the utter inutility of
<lb />the attempt; you see, and I told you before-hand, that
<lb />nothing could save him.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>True; but had I been firmer in refusal, I might
<lb />not so well have known it; I might then have upbraid&shy;
<lb />ed myself with supposing that my compliance would
<lb />have rescued him.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q id="MN39">You have indeed,</q> cried <persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Monckton</persName>, <q id="MN40">fallen
<lb />into most worthless hands, and the Dean was much to
<lb />blame for naming so lightly a guardian to a fortune
<lb />such as yours.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE316">Pardon me,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE317">he never entrusted
	      <lb />him with my fortune, he committed it wholly to <persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic>
<lb />Briggs</persName>.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But if he knew not the various subterfuges by
<pb n="531" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">143</mw>
<lb />which such a caution might be baffled, he ought to have
	      <lb />taken advice of those who were better informed.  <persName>Mr.
<lb />Briggs</persName>, too! what a wretch! mean, low, vulgar, sor&shy;
<lb />did!&mdash;the whole city of <placeName>London</placeName>, I believe, could not
<lb />produce such another! how unaccountable to make
<lb />you the ward of a man whose house you cannot enter
<lb />without disgust!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE318">His house,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE319">my uncle never wished
<lb />me to enter:  he believed, and he was right, that my for&shy;
<lb />tune would be safe in his hands; but for myself, he
<lb />concluded I should always reside at <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q id="MN41">But does not the city at this time,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monck&shy;
<lb />ton</persName>, <q id="MN42">abound in families where, while your fortune
<lb />was in security, you might yourself have lived with
<lb />propriety?  Nothing requires circumspection so minute
<lb />as the choice of a guardian to a girl of large fortune;
<lb />and in general one thing only is attended to, an appear&shy;
<lb />ance of property.  Morals, integrity, character, are
<lb />either not thought of, or investigated so superficially,
<lb />that the enquiry were as well wholly omitted.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then continued his relation.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr<sic corr="."></sic> Harrel</persName> hastened with his 3000<term rend="slant(italic)">l.</term> to the
 gaming&shy;
<lb />table; one throw of the dice settled the business; he
<lb />lost, and ought immediately to have doubled the sum.
<lb />That however, was never more likely to be in his pow&shy;
<lb />er; he knew it; he knew, too, the joint claims of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>'s deceived admirers, and that his house was
<lb />again threatened with executions from various quar&shy;
<lb />ters:&mdash;he went home, loaded his pistols, and took the
<lb />methods already related to work himself into courage
<lb />for the deed.</p>
<p><lb />The means by which <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had procured
<lb />these particulars were many and various, and not all
<lb />such as he could avow; since in the course of his re&shy;
<pb n="532" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="S4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">144</mw>
<lb />searches, he had tampered with servants and waiters,
<lb />and scrupled at no methods that led but to discovery.</p>
<p><lb />Nor did his intelligence stop here.  He had often,
<lb />he said, wondered at the patience of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>'s
<lb />creditors, but now even that was cleared up by a fresh
<lb />proof of infamy:  he had been himself at the house in
	    <lb /><placeName>Portman-square</placeName>, where he was informed that <persName>Mr.
<lb />Harrel</persName> had kept them quiet, by repeated assurances
<lb />that his ward, in a short time, meant to lend him
<lb />money for discharging them all.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> saw now but too clearly the reason her stay
<lb />in his house was so important to him; and wondered
<lb />less at his vehemence upon that subject, though she
<lb />detested it more.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE320">Oh how little,</q> cried she, <q id="CE321">are the gay and the
<lb />dissipated to be known upon a short acquaintance?
<lb />Expensive, indeed, and thoughtless and luxurious he
<lb />appeared to me immediately; but fraudulent, base,
<lb />designing, capable of every pernicious art of trea&shy;
<lb />chery and duplicity,&mdash;such, indeed, I expected not to
<lb />find him; his very flightiness and levity seemed in&shy;
<lb />compatible with such hypocrisy.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MN43">His flightiness,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, <q id="MN44">proceeded
<lb />not from gaiety of heart, it was merely the effect of
<lb />of effort; and his spirits were as mechanical as his taste
<lb />for diversion.  He had not strong parts, nor were his
<lb />vices the result of his passions; had &oelig;conomy been
<lb />as much in fashion as extravagance, he would have
<lb />been equally eager to practise it; he was a mere time&shy;
<lb />server, he struggled but to be <emph>something</emph>, and having
<lb />neither talents nor sentiments to know what, he looked
<lb />around him for any pursuit, and seeing distinction was
<lb />more easily attained in the road to ruin than in any
<lb />other, he gallopped along it, thoughtless of being
<pb n="533" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">145</mw>
<lb />thrown when he came to the bottom, and suffi&shy;
<lb />ciently gratified in shewing his horsemanship by the
<lb />way.</q></p>
<p><lb />And now, all that he had either to hear or to com&shy;
<lb />municate upon this subject being told, he enquired,
<lb />with a face strongly expressive of his disapprobation,
<lb />why he found her at <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>'s, and what had be&shy;
<lb />come of her resolution to avoid his house.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who, in the hurry of her mind and her af&shy;
<lb />fairs, had wholly forgotten that such a resolution had
<lb />been taken, blushed at the question, and could not, at
<lb />first, recollect what had urged her to break it:  but
<lb />when he proceeded to mention <persName>Mr. Briggs</persName>, she was no
<lb />longer distressed; she gave a circumstantial account
<lb />of her visit to him, related the mean misery in which
<lb />he lived, and told him the impracticability of her re&shy;
<lb />siding in such a house.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> could now in decency make no fur&shy;
<lb />ther opposition, however painful and reluctant was
<lb />his acquiescence; yet before he quitted her, he gave
<lb />himself the consolation of considerably obliging her,
<lb />and softened his chagrin by the sweetness of her ac&shy;
<lb />knowledgments.</p>
<p><lb />He enquired how much money in all she had now
	    <lb />taken up of the <name>Jew</name>; and hearing it was 9050<term rend="slant(italic)">l.</term> he
<lb />represented to her the additional loss she must suffer by
<lb />paying an exorbitant interst for so large a sum, and
<lb />the almost certainty with which she might be assured
<lb />of very gross imposition:  he expatiated, also, upon
<lb />the injury which her character might receive in the
<lb />world, were it known that she used such methods to
<lb />procure money, since the circumstances which had
<lb />been her inducement would probably either be unno&shy;
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">VOL.&blank;II.&blank;No.&blank;23.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">T</mw>
<pb n="534" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">146</mw>
<lb />ticed or misrepresented; and when he had awakened
<lb />in her much uneasiness and regret upon this subject he
	    <lb />offered to pay the <name>Jew</name> without delay, clear her wholly
<lb />from his power, and quietly receive the money when
<lb />she came of age from herself.</p>
<p><lb />A proposal so truly friendly made her look upon the
<lb />regard of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> in a higher and nobler point of
<lb />view than her utmost esteem and reverence had hitherto
<lb />placed it:  yet she declined the offer, from an appre&shy;
<lb />hension it might occasion him inconvenience; but when
<lb />he assured her he had a yet larger sum lying at present
<lb />useless in a banker's hands, and promised to receive the
<lb />same interest for his money he should be paid from the
<lb />funds, she joyfully listened to him; and it was settled
<lb />that they should send for the Jew, take his discharge,
<lb />and utterly dismiss him.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, however, fearful of appearing too
<lb />officious in her affairs, wished not to have his part in
<lb />the transaction published, and advised <persName>Cecilia</persName> not to
	    <lb />reveal the matter to the <name>Delviles</name>.  But great as was his
<lb />ascendant over her mind, her aversion to mystery and
<lb />hypocrisy were still greater; she would not, therefore,
<lb />give him this promise, though her own desire to wait
<lb />some seasonable opportunity for disclosing it, made
	    <lb />her consent that their meeting with the <name>Jew</name> should be
	    <lb />at the house of <persName>Mrs. Roberts</persName>, in <placeName>Fetter-lane</placeName>, at twelve
<lb />o'clock the next morning; where she might also see
	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Hill</persName> and her children before she left town.</p>
<p><lb />They now parted, <persName>Cecilia</persName> charmed more than ever
<lb />with her friend, whose kindness, as she suspected not
<lb />his motives, seemed to spring from the most disinter&shy;
<lb />ested generosity.</p>
<p><lb />That, however, was the smallest feature in the cha&shy;
<pb n="535" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">147</mw>
<lb />racter of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who was entirely a man of
<lb />the world, shrewd, penetrating, attentive to his interest,
<lb />and watchful of every advantage to improve it.  In
<lb />the service he now did <persName>Cecilia</persName>, he was gratified by giv&shy;
<lb />ing her pleasure, but that was by no means his only
<lb />gratification:  he still hoped her fortune would one
<lb />day be his own, he was glad to transact any business
<lb />with her, and happy in making her owe to him an ob&shy;
<lb />ligation:  but his principal inducement was yet
<lb />stronger:  he saw with much alarm the facility of her
<lb />liberality; and he feared while she continued in corres&shy;
	    <lb />pondence with the <name>Jew</name>, that the easiness with which
<lb />she could raise money would be a motive with her
<lb />to continue the practice whenever she was softened
<lb />by distress, or subdued by entreaty:  but he hoped, by
<lb />totally concluding the negociation, the temptation
<lb />would be removed:  and that the hazard and inconve&shy;
<lb />nience of renewing it, would strengthen her aversion
<lb />to such an expedient, till, between difficulties and
<lb />disuse, that dangerous resource would be thought of
<lb />no more.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then returned to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, whom she
<lb />found as she had left, weeping in the arms of her bro&shy;
<lb />ther.  They consulted upon what was best to be done,
<lb />and agreed that she ought instantly to leave town; for
<lb />which purpose a chaise was ordered directly.  They
<lb />settled also that <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, when he had conveyed
	    <lb />her to his country house, which was in <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, should
<lb />hasten back to superintend the funeral, and see if any
<lb />thing could be saved from the creditors for his sister.</p>
<p><lb />Yet this plan, till <persName>Cecilia</persName> was summoned to dinner,
<lb />they had not the resolution to put in practice.  They
<lb />were then obliged to be gone, and their parting was
<pb n="536" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">148</mw>
<lb />very melancholy.  <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName> wept immoderately,
<lb />and <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName> felt a concern too tender for avowal,
<lb />though too sincere for concealment.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, however
<lb />glad to change her situation, was extremely depressed
<lb />by their sorrow, and entreated to have frequent ac&shy;
<lb />counts of their proceedings, warmly repeating her
<lb />offers of service, and protestations of faithful regard.</p>
<p><lb />She accompanied them to the chaise, and then went
	    <lb />to the dining parlour, where she saw <persName>Mr.</persName> and <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, but saw nothing more of their son the whole
<lb />day.</p>
<p><lb />The next morning after breakfast, <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> set
<lb />out upon some leave-taking visits, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> went in
	    <lb />a chair to <placeName>Fetter-lane</placeName>:  here, already waiting for her,
<lb />she met the punctual <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, and the disap&shy;
<lb />pointed Jew, who most unwillingly was paid off, and
<lb />relinquished his bonds; and who found in the severe
<lb />and crafty <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, another sort of man to deal
<lb />with than the necessitous and heedless <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />As soon as he was dismissed, other bonds were
<lb />drawn and signed, the old ones were destroyed; and
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, to her infinite satisfaction, had no creditor but
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.  Her bookseller, indeed, was still un&shy;
<lb />paid, but her debt with him was public, and gave her
<lb />not any uneasiness.</p>
<p><lb />She now, with the warmest expressions of gratitude,
<lb />took leave of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, who suffered the most
<lb />painful struggles in repressing the various apprehen&shy;
<lb />sions to which the parting, and her establishment at the
<lb />Delvile's, gave rise.</p></div>

<p rend="indent(0)">
	    <lb /><placeName>Delvile Castle</placeName> was situated in a large and woody
<lb />park, and surrounded by a moat.  A draw-bridge
<lb />which fronted the entrance was every night by order
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, with the same care as if still necessary
<lb />for the preservation of the family, regularly drawn up.
<lb />Some fortifications still remained entire, and vestiges
<lb />were every where to be traced of more; no taste was
<lb />shewn in the disposition of the grounds, no openings
<lb />were contrived through the wood for distant views or
<lb />beautiful objects:  the mansion-house was ancient,
<lb />large and magnificent, but constructed with as little at&shy;
<lb />tention to convenience and comfort, as to airiness
<lb />and elegance; it was dark, heavy, and monastic,
<lb />equally in want of repair, and of improvement.  The
<lb />grandeur of its former inhabitants was every where
<lb />visible, but the decay into which it was falling rendered
<lb />such remains mere objects for meditation and melan&shy;
<lb />choly; while the evident struggle to support some ap&shy;
<lb />pearance of its ancient dignity, made the dwelling and
<lb />all in its vicinity wear an aspect of constraint and
<lb />austerity.  Festivity, joy and pleasure, seemed foreign
<lb />to the purposes of its construction; silence, solemnity
<lb />and contemplation were adapted to it only.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, however, took all possible care to
<lb />make the apartments and situation of <persName>Cecilia</persName> commo&shy;
<pb n="543" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">150</mw>
<lb />dious and pleasant, and to banish by her kindness and
<lb />animation the gloom and formality which her mansion
<lb />inspired.  Nor were her efforts ungratefully received;
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, charmed by every mark of attention from a
<lb />woman she so highly admired, returned her solicitude
<lb />by encreasing affection, and repaid all her care by the
<lb />revival of her spirits.  She was happy, indeed, to have
<lb />quitted the disorderly house of <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName>, where ter&shy;
<lb />ror so continually awakened, was only to be lulled by
<lb />the grossest imposition; and though her mind, depres&shy;
<lb />sed by what was passed, and in suspense with what
<lb />was to come, was by no means in a state for uninter&shy;
<lb />rupted enjoyment, yet to find herself placed, at last,
<lb />without effort or impropriety, in the very mansion she
<lb />had so long considered as her road to happiness, ren&shy;
<lb />dered her, notwithstanding her remaining sources of
<lb />inquietude, more contented than she had yet felt herself
	    <lb />since her departure from <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />Even the imperious <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> was more support&shy;
<lb />able here than in <placeName>London</placeName>:  secure in his own castle, he
<lb />looked around him with a pride of power and of pos&shy;
<lb />session, which softened while it swelled him.  His
<lb />superiority was undisputed, his will was without con&shy;
<lb />troul.  He was not, as in the great capital of the
<lb />kingdom, surrounded by competitors; no rivalry dis&shy;
<lb />turbed his peace, no equality mortified his greatness;
<lb />all he saw were either vassals of his power, or guests
<lb />bending to his pleasure; he abated, therefore, consider&shy;
<lb />ably, the stern gloom of his haughtiness, and soothed
<lb />his proud mind by the courtesy of condescension.</p>
<p><lb />Little, however, was the opportunity that <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />found for evincing that spirit and forbearance she had
<lb />planned in relation to Delvile; he breakfasted by him&shy;
<pb n="544" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">151</mw>
<lb />self every morning, rode or walked out alone till driven
<lb />home by the heat of the day, and spent the rest of his
<lb />time till dinner in his own study.  When he then ap&shy;
<lb />peared, his conversation was always general, and his
<lb />attention not more engaged by <persName>Cecilia</persName> than by his
<lb />mother.  Left by them with his father, he commonly
<lb />continued with him till tea-time, and then rode or
<lb />strolled out to some neighbouring family, and it was
<lb />always uncertain whether he was again seen before
<lb />dinner the next day.</p>
<p><lb />By this conduct, reserve on her part was rendered
<lb />totally unnecessary; she could give no discourage&shy;
<lb />ment where she met with no assiduity; she had no
<lb />occasion to fly, where she was never pursued.</p>
<p><lb />Strange, however, she thought such behaviour, and
<lb />utterly impossible to be the effect of accident; his
<lb />desire to avoid her seemed scrupulous and pointed,
<lb />and however to the world it might wear the appear&shy;
<lb />ance of chance to her watchful anxiety a thousand cir&shy;
<lb />cumstances marked it for design.  She found that
<lb />his friends at home had never seen so little of him,
<lb />complaints were continually made of his frequent ab&shy;
<lb />sences, and much surprise was expressed at his new
<lb />manner of life, and what might be the occupations
<lb />which so strangely engrossed his time.</p>
<p><lb />Had her heart not interfered in this matter, she
<lb />might now have been perfectly at rest, since she was
<lb />spared the renunciation she had projected, and since,
<lb />without either mental exertion or personal trouble, the
	    <lb />affiar seemed totally dropt, and <persName>Delvile</persName>, far from mani&shy;
<lb />festing any design of conquest, shunned all occasions of
<lb />gallantry, and sedulously avoided even common con&shy;
<lb />versation with her.  If he saw her preparing to walk
<pb n="545" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="T4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">152</mw>
<lb />out in an evening, he was certain to stay at home; if
<lb />his mother was with her, and invited him to join them
<lb />he was sure to be ready with some other engagement;
<lb />and if by accident he met her in the park, he merely
<lb />stopt to speak of the weather, bowed, and hurried on.</p>
<p><lb />How to reconcile a coldness so extraordinary with a
<lb />fervour so animated as that which he had lately shewn,
<lb />was indeed not easy; sometimes she fancied he had
	    <lb />entangled not only the poor <persName>Henrietta</persName>, but himself, at
<lb />other times she believed him merely capricious; but
<lb />that he studied to avoid her she was convinced inva&shy;
<lb />riably, and such a conviction was alone sufficient to
<lb />determine her upon forwarding his purpose.  And,
<lb />when her first surprise was over, and first chagrin
<lb />abated, her own pride came to her aid, and she re&shy;
<lb />solved to use every method in her power to conquer a
<lb />partiality so ungratefully bestowed.  She rejoiced that
<lb />in no instance she had ever betrayed it, and she saw
<lb />that his own behaviour prevented all suspicion of it in
<lb />the family.  Yet, in the midst of her mortification and
<lb />displeasure, she found some consolation in seeing that
<lb />those mercenary views of which she had once been led
<lb />to accuse him, were farthest from his thoughts, and
<lb />that whatever was the state of his mind, she had no ar&shy;
<lb />tifice to apprehend, nor design to guard against.  All
<lb />therefore that remained was to imitate his example, be
<lb />civil and formal, shun all interviews that were not pub&shy;
<lb />lic, and decline all discourse but what good breeding
<lb />occasionally made necessary.</p>
<p><lb />By these means their meetings became more rare
<lb />than ever, and of shorter duration, for if one by any
<lb />accident was detained, the other retired; till by their
<lb />mutual diligence they soon only saw each other at
<pb n="546" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">153</mw>
<lb />dinner:  and though neither of them knew the motives
<lb />or the intentions of the other, the best concerted agree&shy;
<lb />ment could not more effectually have separated them.</p>
<p><lb />This task to <persName>Cecilia</persName> was at first extremely painful;
<lb />but time and constancy of mind soon lessened its diffi&shy;
<lb />culty.  She amused herself with walking and reading,
<lb />she commissioned <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> to send her a piano&shy;
	    <lb />forte of <name>Merlin's</name>, she was fond of fine work, and she
<lb />found in the conversation of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> a never-fail&shy;
<lb />ing resource against langour and sadness.  Leaving
<lb />therefore to himself her mysterious son, she wisely re&shy;
<lb />solved to find other employment for her thoughts, than
<lb />conjectures with which she could not be satisfied, and
<lb />doubts that might never be explained.</p>
<p><lb />Very few families visited at the castle, and fewer still
<lb />had their visits returned.  The arrogance of <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>
<lb />had offended all the neighbouring gentry, who could
<lb />easily be better entertained than by receiving instruc&shy;
<lb />tions of their own inferiority, which however readily
<lb />they might allow, was by no means so pleasant a sub&shy;
<lb />ject as to recompence them for hearing no other.  And
<lb />if <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> was shunned through hatred, his lady no
<lb />less was avoided through fear; high spirited and fasti&shy;
<lb />dious, she was easily wearied and disgusted, she bore
<lb />neither with frailty nor folly&mdash;those two principal in&shy;
<lb />gredients in human nature!  She required, to obtain her
<lb />favour, the union of virtue and abilities with elegance,
<lb />which meeting but rarely, she was rarely disposed to be
<lb />pleased; and disdaining to conceal either contempt or
<lb />aversion, she inspired in return nothing but dread or re&shy;
<lb />sentment:  making thus, by a want of that lenity which
<lb />is the <emph>milk of human kindness</emph>, and the bond of society,
<lb />enemies the most numerous and illiberal by those very
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">23.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">U</mw>
<pb n="547" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">154</mw>
<lb />talents which, more <emph>meekly borne</emph> would have rendered
<lb />her not merely admired, but adored!</p>
<p><lb />In proportion, however, as she was thus at war with
<lb />the world in general, the chosen few who were honour&shy;
<lb />ed with her favour, she loved with a zeal all her own;
<lb />her heart, liberal, open, and but too daringly sincere,
<lb />was fervent in affection, and enthusiastic in admiration;
<lb />the friends who were dear to her, she was devoted to
<lb />serve, she magnified their virtues till she thought them
<lb />of a higher race of beings, she inflamed her generosi&shy;
<lb />ty with ideas of what she owed to them, till her life
<lb />seemed too small a sacrifice to be refused for their
<lb />service.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Such was the love which already she felt for <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>; her countenance had struck, her manners had
<lb />charmed her, her understanding was displayed by the
<lb />quick intelligence of her eyes, and every action and
<lb />every notion spoke her mind the seat of elegance.  In
<lb />secret she sometimes regretted that she was not higher
<lb />born, but that regret always vanished when she saw
<lb />and conversed with her.</p>
<p><lb />Her own youth had been passed in all the severity of
<lb />affliction; she had been married to <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> by her
<lb />relations, without any consultation of her heart or her
<lb />will.  Her strong mind disdained useless complaints,
<lb />yet her discontent, however private, was deep.  Ar&shy;
<lb />dent in her disposition, and naturally violent in her
<lb />passions, her feelings were extremely acute, and to
<lb />curb them by reason and principle had been the chief
	    <lb />and hard study of her life.  To love <persName>Mr. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName> she felt was impossible; proud without merit, and
<lb />imperious without capacity, she saw with bitterness
<pb n="548" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">155</mw>
<lb />the inferiority of his faculties, and she found in his
<lb />temper no qualities to endear or attract:  yet she re&shy;
<lb />spected his birth and his family, of which her own
<lb />was a branch, and whatever was her misery from the
<lb />connection, she steadily behaved to him with the strict&shy;
<lb />est propriety.</p>
<p><lb />Her son, however, when she was blessed with his
<lb />presence, had a power over her mind that mitgated all
<lb />her sorrows, and almost lulled even her wishes to sleep:
<lb />she rather idolized than loved him, yet her fondness
<lb />flowed not from relationship, but from his worth and
<lb />his character, his talents and his disposition.  She saw
<lb />in him, indeed, all her own virtues and excellencies,
<lb />with a toleration for the imperfections of others to
<lb />which she was wholly a stranger.  Whatever was great
<lb />or good she expected him to perform; occasion alone
<lb />she thought wanting to manifest him the first of hu&shy;
<lb />man beigns.</p>
<p><lb />Nor here was <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> himself less sanguine in
<lb />his hopes; his son was not only the first object of his
<lb />affection, but the chief idol of his pride, and he did not
<lb />merely cherish but reverence him as his successor, the
<lb />only support of his ancient name and family, without
<lb />whose life and health the whole race would be extinct.
<lb />He consulted him in all his affairs, never mentioned him
<lb />but with distinction, and expeceted the whole world to
<lb />bow down before him.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> in his behaviour to his father imitated the
<lb />conduct of his mother, who opposed him in nothing
<lb />when his pleasure was made known, but who forbore
<lb />to enquire into his opinion except in cases of necessity.
	    <lb />Their minds, indeed, were totally dissimilar; and <persName>Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName> well knew that if he submitted to his directions, he
<pb n="549" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">156</mw>
<lb />must demand such respect as the world would refuse
<lb />with indignation, and scarcely speak to a man whose
<lb />genealogy was not known to him.</p>
<p><lb />But though duty and gratitude were the only ties
<lb />that bound him to his father, he loved his mother not
<lb />merely with filial affection, but with the purest esteem
<lb />and highest reverence; he knew, too, that while with&shy;
<lb />out him her existence would be a burthen, her tender&shy;
<lb />ness was no effusion of weak partiality, but founded
<lb />on the strongest assurances of his worth; and however
<lb />to maternal indulgence its origin might be owing, the
<lb />rectitude of his own conduct could alone save it from
<lb />dimunition.</p>
<p><lb />Such was the house in which <persName>Cecilia</persName> was now set&shy;
<lb />tled, and with which she lived almost to the exclusion
<lb />of the sight of any other; for though she had now
<lb />been three weeks at the castle, she had only at church
	    <lb />seen any family but the <name>Delviles</name>.</p>
<p><lb />Nor did any thing in the course of that time occur
<lb />to her, but the reception of a melancholy letter from
<lb /><persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, filled with complaints of her retirement
<lb />and misery; and another from <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, with an
<lb />account of the funeral, the difficulties he had had to
<lb />encounter with the creditors, who had even seized the
<lb />dead body, and the numerous expences in which he
<lb />had been involved, by petitions he could not withstand,
<lb />from the meaner and more clamorous of those whom
<lb />his late brother-in-law had left unpaid.  He concluded
<lb />with a pathetic prayer for her happiness, and a decla&shy;
<lb />ration that his own was lost for ever, since now he was
<lb />even deprived of her sight.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> wrote an affec&shy;
<lb />tionate answer to <persName>Mrs. Harrel</persName>, promising, when fully
<lb />at liberty, that she would herself fetch her to her own
<pb n="550" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">157</mw>
<lb />house in Suffolk:  but she could only send her compli&shy;
<lb />ments to <persName>Mr. Arnott</persName>, though her compassion urged a
<lb />kinder message; as she feared even a shadow of en&shy;
<lb />couragement to so serious, yet hopeless a passion.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />At this time the house was much enlivened by a
	    <lb />visit from <persName>Lady Honoria Pemberton</persName>, who came to
<lb />spend a month with <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Young <persName>Delvile</persName>, who had kept his room some days
<lb />through indisposition, was now preparing for a jour&shy;
	    <lb />ney to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>; <persName>Cecilia</persName> dreaded the approaching sepa&shy;
<lb />ration, and endeavoured to fortify her mind for bear&shy;
<lb />ing it with propriety.</p>
<p><lb />As she entered the parlour one morning, soon after
	    <lb />breakfast, she was much astonished to find young <persName>Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName> alone, walking about the room with his tablets in
<lb />his hand, in which <sic corr="h">b</sic>e had been writing.</p>
<p><lb />From a mixture of shame and surprize, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, at
<lb />the sight of him, was involuntarily retreating; but,
<lb />hastening to the door, he called out in a reproachful
<lb />tone, <q>Will you not even enter the same room with
<lb />me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE322">Oh yes,</q> cried she, returning; <q id="CE323">I was only afraid
<lb />I disturbed you.</q></p>
<pb n="551" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">158</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q id="MO65">No, madam,</q> answered he, gravely; <q id="MO66">you are
<lb />the only person who could <emph>not</emph> disturb me, since my
<lb />employment was making memorandums for a letter to
<lb />yourself:  with which, however, I did not desire to im&shy;
<lb />portune you, but that you have denied me the honour
<lb />of even a five minutes audience.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> in the utmost confusion at this attack, knew
<lb />not whether to stand still or proceed:  but, as he pre&shy;
<lb />sently continued his speech, she found she had no
<lb />choice but to stay.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I should be sorry to quit this place, especially as
<lb />my absence is extremely uncertain, while I have the
<lb />unhappiness to be under your displeasure, without
<lb />making some little attempt to apologize for the beha&shy;
<lb />viour which incurred it.  Must I, then, finish my let&shy;
<lb />ter, or will you at last deign to hear me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE324">My displeasure, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>,<q id="CE325">died with its
<lb />occasion; I beg, therefore, that it may rest no longer
<lb />in your remembrance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I meant not, madam, to infer, that the subject, or
<lb />indeed that the object merited your deliberate atten&shy;
<lb />tion; I simply wish to explain what may have ap&shy;
<lb />peared mysterious in my conduct, and for what may
<lb />have seemed still more censurable, to beg your
<lb />pardon.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now, recovered from her first apprehensions,
<lb />and calmed, because piqued, by the calmness with
<lb />which he spoke himself, made no opposition to his re&shy;
<lb />quest, but suffering him to shut both the doors leading
<lb />into the garden, and that which led into the hall, she
<lb />seated herself at one of the windows, determined to
<lb />listen with intrepidity to this long expected expla&shy;
<lb />nation.</p>
<pb n="552" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">159</mw>
<p>
<lb />The preparations, however, which he made to ob&shy;
<lb />viate being overheard, added to the steadiness with
<lb />which <persName>Cecilia</persName> waited his further proceedings, soon
<lb />robbed him of the courage with which he began the
<lb />assault, and evidently gave him a wish of retreating
<lb />himslef.</p>
<p><lb />At length, after much hesitation, he said, <q>This in&shy;
<lb />dulgence, madam, deserves my most grateful acknow&shy;
<lb />ledgments; it is, indeed, what I had little right, and
<lb />still less reason, after the severity I have met with
<lb />from you, to expect.</q></p>
<p><lb />And here, at the very mention of severity, his cou&shy;
<lb />rage, called upon by his pride, instantly returned, and
<lb />he went on with the same spirit he had begun.</p>
<p><lb /><q>That severity, however, I mean not to lament; on
<lb />the contrary, in a situation such as mine, it was per&shy;
<lb />haps the first blessing I could receive; I have found
<lb />from it, indeed, more advantage and relief than from
<lb />all that philosophy, reflection or fortitude could offer.
<lb />It has shewn me the vanity of bewailing the barrier
<lb />placed by fate to my wishes, since it has shewn me
<lb />that another, less inevitable, but equally insuperable,
<lb />would have opposed them.  I have determined, there&shy;
<lb />fore, after a struggle I must confess the most painful,
<lb />to deny myself the dangerous solace of your society,
<lb />and endeavour, by joining dissipation to reason, to
<lb />forget the too great pleasure which hitherto it has
<lb />afforded me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE326">Easy, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE327">will be your task:  I
<lb />can only wish the re-establishment of your health may
<lb />be found no more difficult.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO67">Ah madam,</q> cried he, with a reproachful smile,
<lb /><q id="MO68"><emph>he jests at scars who never felt a wound!</emph>&mdash;but this
<pb n="553" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="U4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">160</mw>
<lb />is a strain in which I have no right to talk, and I will
<lb />neither offend your delicacy, nor my own integrity, by
<lb />endeavouring to work upon the generosity of your dis&shy;
<lb />position in order to excite your compassion.  Not such
<lb />was the motive with which I begged this audience;
<lb />but merely a desire, before I tear myself away, to open
<lb />to you my heart, without palliation or reserve.</q></p>
<p><lb />He paused a few moments:  and <persName>Cecilia</persName> finding her
<lb />suspicions just that this interview was meant to be
<lb />final, considered that her trial, however severe, would
<lb />be short, and call forth all her resolution to sustain it
<lb />with spirit.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO69">Long before I had the honour of your acquaint&shy;
<lb />ance,</q> he continued, <q id="MO70">your character and your ac&shy;
	      <lb />complishments were known to me:  <persName>Mr. Biddulph</persName> of
	      <lb /><placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, who was my first friend at Oxford, and with
<lb />whom my intimacy is still undiminished, was early sen&shy;
<lb />sible of your excellencies; we corresponded, and his
<lb />letters were filled with your praises.  He confessed to
<lb />me, that his admiration had been unfortunate:&mdash;alas!  I
<lb />might now make the same confession to him?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mr. Biddulph</persName>, among many of the neighbouring
<lb />gentlemen, had made proposals to the Dean for <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />which, at her desire, were rejected.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>When <persName>Mr. Harrel</persName> saw masks in <placeName>Portman-square</placeName>,
<lb />my curiosity to behold a lady so adored, and so cruel,
<lb />led me thither; your dress made you easily distin&shy;

<lb />that something which I felt for myself, warned me in&shy;

<lb />over!&mdash;the change of name is the obstacle; he inherits
<lb />all the pride of his family,&mdash;and therefore to that
<lb />family will I unrepining leave him!</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO71">This warning,</q> he continued, <q id="MO72">I should not have
<lb />disregarded, had I not, at the Opera, been deceived into
<lb />a belief you were engaged; I then wished no longer
<lb />to shun you; bound in honour to forbear all efforts at
<lb />supplanting a man, to whom I thought you almost uni&shy;
<lb />ted, I considered you already as married, and eagerly
<lb />as I sought your society, I sought it not with more plea&shy;
<lb />sure than innocence.  Yet even then, to be candid, I
<lb />found in myself a restlessness about your affairs that
<lb />kept me in eternal perturbation; but I flattered my&shy;
<lb />self it was mere curiosity, and only excited by the per&shy;
<lb />petual change of opinion to which occasion gave rise,
<lb />concerning which was the happy man.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE328">I am sorry,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, coolly, <q id="CE329">there was any
<lb />such mistake.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO73">I will not, madam, fatigue you,</q> he returned, <q id="MO74">by
<lb />tracing the progress of my unfortunate admiration; I will
<lb />endeavour to be more brief, for I see you are already
<lb />wearied.</q>  He stopt a moment, hoping for some little
<lb />encouragement:  but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in no humour to give it, as&shy;
<lb />sumed an air of unconcern, and sat wholly quiet<sic corr="."></sic></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO75">I knew not,</q> he then went on, with a look of ex&shy;
<lb />treme mortification, <q id="MO76">the warmth with which I ho&shy;
<lb />noured your virtues, till you deigned to plead to me for
<lb /><persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>&mdash;but let me not recollect the feelings of
<lb />that moment!&mdash;yet were they nothing,&mdash;cold, lan&shy;
<lb />guid, lifeless, to what I afterwards experienced, when
<lb />you undeceived me finally with respect to your situa&shy;
	      <lb />tion, and informed the report concerning <persName>Sir Ro&shy;
<lb />bert Floyer</persName> was equally erroneous with that which

<lb />&mdash;to see you before me,&mdash;by the disorder of my whole
<lb />frame to discover the mistake I had chreished&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> then, half rising, yet again seating herself,
<lb />looked extremely impatient to be gone.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO77">Pardon me, madam,</q> he cried; <q id="MO78">I will have
<lb />done, and trace my feelings and my sufferings no
<lb />longer, but hasten, for my own sake as well as yours,
<lb />to the reason why I have spoken at all.  From the
<lb />hour that my ill-destined passion was fully known to
<lb />myself, I weighed all the consequences of indulging
<lb />it, and found, added to the extreme hazard of success,
<lb />an impropriety even in the attempt.  <emph>My</emph> honour in
<lb />the honour of my family is bound! what to that would
<lb />seem wrong, in me would be unjustifiable:  yet where
<lb />inducements so numerous were opposed by one single
<lb />objection!&mdash;where virtue, beauty, education, and fa&shy;
<lb />mily were all unexceptionable,&mdash;Oh cruel clause!
<lb />barbarous and repulsive clause! that forbids my as&shy;
<lb />piring to the first of women, but by an action that with
<lb />my own family would degrade me for ever!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />He stopt, overpowered by his own emotion, and <persName>Ceci&shy;
<lb />lia arose</persName>. <q id="MO79">I see, madam,</q> he cried, <q id="MO80">your eagerness to
<lb />be gone, and however at this moment I may lament it,
<lb />I shall recollect it hereafter with advantage.  But to
<lb />conclude:  I determined to avoid you, and, by avoid&shy;
<lb />ing, to endeavour to forget you:  I determined, also,
<lb />that no human being, and yourself least of all, should
<lb />know, should even suspect the situation of my mind:
<lb />and though upon various occasions, my prudence and
<lb />forbearance have suddenly yielded to surprise and to
<lb />passion, the surrender has been short, and almost, I be&shy;

<lb /><q>This silence and this avoidance I sustained with

<lb />prised, every passion awake, and tenderness trium&shy;
<lb />phant&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE330">Why, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, angrily, <q id="CE331">and for what

<p><lb /><q id="MO81">Alas!  I know not!</q> said he, with a deep sigh:
<lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()" id="MO82">I thought myself better qualified for this conference,
<lb />and meant to be firm and concise.  I have told my

<lb />flicts I do not mention, for I dare not!  O were I to
<lb />paint to you the bitter struggles of a mind all at war
<lb />with itself&mdash;Duty, spirit, and fortitude, combating<sic corr="&amp;blank;"></sic>love,
<lb />happiness and inclination,&mdash;each conquering alternate&shy;
<lb />ly, and alternately each vanquished,&mdash;I could endure
<lb />it no longer, I resolved by one effort to finish the strife,
<lb />and to undrego an instant of even exquisite torture, in
<lb />preference to a continuance of such lingering misery!</q></p>

<p><lb /><q rend="slant(italic)" id="MO85">Since I fancy it has been injured!</q> repeated he,
<lb /><q id="MO86">what a phrase, after an avowal such as mine!  But
<lb />why should I wish to convince you of my sincerity,
<lb />when to you it cannot be more indifferent, than to my&shy;
<lb />self it is unfortunate!  I have now only to entreat your
<lb />pardon for the robbery I have committed upon your
<lb />time, and to repeat my acknowledgments that you
<lb />have endeavoured to hear me with patience.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE334">If you honour me, Sir, with some portion of your

<lb />ledgments, perhaps, should be mine; suppose them,
<lb />however made, for I have a letter to write, and can
<lb />therefore stay no longer.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO87">Nor do I presume, madam,</q> cried he, proudly,
<lb /><q id="MO88">to detain you:  hitherto you may frequently have
<lb />thought me mysterious, sometimes strange and caprici&shy;
<lb />ous, and perhaps almost always unmeaning; to clear
<lb />myself from these imputations by a candid confession
<lb />of the motives which have governed me, is all that I
<lb />wished.  Once, also&mdash;I hope but once, you thought me
<lb />impertinent,&mdash;there, indeed, I less dare vindicate
<lb />myself&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE336">There is no occasion, Sir,</q> interrupted she, walking
<lb />towards the door, <q id="CE337">for further vindication in any
<lb />thing; I am perfectly satisfied, and if my good wishes
<lb />are worth your acceptance, assure yourself you possess
<lb />them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO89">Barbarous and insulting!</q> cried he, half to him&shy;
<lb />self; and then with a quick motion hastening to open
<lb />the door for her, <q id="MO90">Go, madam,</q> added he, almost
<pb n="558" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">165</mw>
<lb />breathless with conflicting emotions, <q id="MO91">go, and be
<lb />your happiness unalterable as your inflexibility!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was turning back to answer this reproach,
	    <lb />but the sight of <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>, who was entering at
<lb />the other door, deterred her, and she went on.</p>
<p><lb />When she came to her own room, she walked about
<lb />it some time in a state so unsettled, between anger
<lb />and disappointment, sorrow and pride, that she scarce
<lb />knew to which emotion to give way, and felt almost
<lb />bursting with each.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE338">The dye,</q> she cried, <q id="CE339">is at last thrown; and
	      <lb />this affair is concluded for ever!  <persName>Delvile</persName> himself is
<lb />content to relinquish me:  no father has commanded,
<lb />no mother has interfered, he has required no admoni&shy;
<lb />tion, full well enabled to act for himself by the power&shy;
<lb />ful instigation of hereditary arrogance!  Yet my
<lb />family, he says,&mdash;unexpected condescension! my fa&shy;
<lb />mily, and every other circumstance is unexceptionable;
<lb />how feeble, then, is that regard which yields to one
<lb />only objection! how potent that haughtiness which to
<lb />nothing will give way!  Well, let him keep his name!
<lb />since so wondrous its properites, so all-sufficient its
<lb />preservation, what vanity, what presumption in me,
<lb />to suppose myself an equivalent for its loss!</q></p>
<p><lb />Thus, deeply offended, her spirits were supported by
<lb />resentment, and not only while in company, but when
<lb />alone, she found herself scarce averse to the approach&shy;
<lb />ing separation, and enabled to endure it without re&shy;
<lb />pining.</p></div>

<p rend="indent(0)">
<lb />The next morning <persName>Cecilia</persName> arose late, to escape see&shy;
<lb />ing the departure of Delvile; she knew that the spirit
<lb />with which she had left him, made him, at present,
<lb />think her wholly insensible, and she was at least happy
<lb />to be spared the mortification of a discovery, since
<lb />she found him thus content, without even solicitation,
<lb />to resign her!</p>
<p>	    <lb />Before she was dressed, <persName>Lady Honoria</persName> informed her
<lb />that <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> proposed accompanying his son to
	    <lb /><placeName>Bristol</placeName>, whose journey therefore was postponed for a
<lb />few hours to give time for new preparations.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Lady Honoria</persName> had but just quitted <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s room,
	    <lb />when the door of it was again opened by <persName>Mortimer</persName>
<lb />himself, booted and equipped for his journey.</p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName> here! and alone!</q> cried he, with a
<lb />look, and in a voice, which shewed that all the pride
<lb />of the preceding evening was sunk into the deepest
<lb />dejection; <q>and does she not fly as I approach her;
<lb />can she patiently bear in her sight one so strange, so
<lb />fiery, so inconsistent?  But she is too wise to resent
<lb />the ravings of a madman;&mdash;and who, under the influ&shy;
<lb />ence of a passion at once hopeless and violent, can
<lb />boast, but at intervals, full possession of his reason?</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, utterly astonished by a gentleness so humble,
<pb n="560" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">167</mw>
<lb />looked at him in silent surprise; he advanced to her
<lb />mournfully, and added, <q>I am ashamed, indeed, of the
<lb />bitterness of spirit with which I last night provoked
<lb />your displeasure, when I should have supplicated your
<lb />lenity:  but though I was prepared for your coldness,
<lb />I could not endure it, and though your indifference
<lb />was almost friendly, it made me little less than frantic;
<lb />so strangely may justice be blinded by passion, and
<lb />every faculty of reason be warped by selfishness!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE340">You have no apology to make, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb /><q id="CE341">since, believe me, I require none.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO92">You may well,</q> returned he, half smiling, <q id="MO93">dis&shy;
<lb />pense with my apologies, since under the sanction of
<lb />that word, I obtained your hearing yesterday.  But,
<lb />believe me, you will now find me far more reasonable;
<lb />a whole night's reflections&mdash;which no repose inter&shy;
<lb />rupted!&mdash;have brought me to my senses.  Even lunatics,
<lb />you know, have lucid moments!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Do you intend, Sir, to set off soon?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I believe so; I wait only for my father.  But why
<lb />is <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> so impatient?  I shall not soon <emph>return</emph>;
<lb />that, at least, is certain, and, for a few instants delay,
<lb />may surely offer some palliation:&mdash;See! if I am not
<lb />ready to again accuse you of severity!&mdash;I must run,
<lb />I find, or all my boasted reformation will end but in
<lb />fresh offence, fresh disgrace, and fresh contrition!
<lb />Adieu, madam!&mdash;and may all prosperity attend you!
<lb />That will ever be my darling wish, however long my
<lb />absence, however distant the climates which may
<lb />part us!</q></p>
<p><lb />He was then hurrying away, but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, from an
<lb />impulse of surprise too sudden to be restrained, ex&shy;
<pb n="561" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="X4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">168</mw>
<lb />claimed, <q>The climates?&mdash;do you, then, mean to
	      <lb />leave <placeName>England</placeName>?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO94">Yes,</q> cried he, with quickness, <q id="MO95">for why should
<lb />I remain in it? a few weeks only could I fill up in any
<lb />tour so near home, and hither in a few weeks to return
<lb />would be folly and madness:  in an absence so brief,
<lb />what thought but that of the approaching meeting
<lb />would occupy me? and what, at that meeting, should
<lb />I feel, but joy the most dangerous, and delight which
<lb />I dare not think of!&mdash;every conflict renewed, every
<lb />struggle re-felt, again all this scene would require to
<lb />be acted, again I must tear myself away, and every
<lb />tumultuous passion now beating in my heart would be
<lb />revived, and, if possible, be revived with added misery!
<lb />&mdash;No!&mdash;neither my temper, nor my constitution will
<lb />endure such another shock, one parting shall suffice,
<lb />and the fortitude with which I will lengthen my self&shy;
<lb />exile, shall atone to myself for the weakness which
<lb />makes it requisite!</q></p>
<p><lb />And then, with a vehemence that seemed fearful of
<lb />the smallest delay, he was again, and yet more hastily
<lb />going, when <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with much emotion, called out,
<lb /><q>Two moments, Sir!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO96">Two thousand! two million!</q> cried he, impetu&shy;
<lb />ously, and returning, with a look of the most earnest
<lb />surprize, he added, <q id="MO97">What is it <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> will
<lb />condescend to command?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE342">Nothing,</q> cried she, recovering her presence of
<lb />mind, <q id="CE343">but to beg you will by no means, upon my
<lb />account, quit your country and your friends, since
<lb />another asylum can be found for myself, and since
<lb />I would much sooner part from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, greatly
<pb n="562" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">169</mw>
<lb />and sincerely as I reverence her, than be instrumental
<lb />to robbing her, even for a month, of her son.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO98">Generous and humane is the consideration,</q> cried
	    <lb />he; <q id="MO99">but who half so generous, so humane as <persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>; so soft to all others, so noble in herself?
<lb />Can my mother have a wish, when I leave her with
<lb />you?  No; she is sensible of your worth, she adores
<lb />you, almost as I adore you myself! you are now
<lb />under her protection, you seem, indeed born for each
<lb />other; let me not, then, deprive her of so honourable
<lb />a charge:&mdash;Oh, why must he, who sees in such colours
<lb />the excellencies of both, who admires with such fer&shy;
<lb />vour the perfections you unite, be torn with this vio&shy;
<lb />lence from the objects he revers, even though half his
<lb />life he would sacrifice, to spend in their society what
<lb />remained!</q>&mdash;</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE344">Well then, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who now felt her
<lb />courage decline, and the softness of sorrow steal fast
<lb />upon her spirits, <q id="CE345">if you will not give up your scheme,
<lb />let me no longer detain you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Will you not wish me a good journey?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes,&mdash;very sincerely.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And you will pardon the unguarded errors which
<lb />have offended you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I will think of them, Sir, no more.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Farewell, then, most amiable of women, and may
<lb />every blessing you deserve light on your head!  I leave
<lb />to you my mother, certain of your sympathetic affec&shy;
<lb />tion for a character so resembling your own.  When
<lb /><emph>you</emph>, madam, leave her, may the happy successor in
<lb />your favour&mdash;</q>  He paused, his voice faultered, <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />too, turned away from him, and, uttering a deep sigh,
<lb />he caught her hand, and, pressing it to his lips, ex&shy;

<lb />claimed, <q>O great be your felicity, in whatever way
<lb />you receive it!&mdash;pure as your virtues, and warm as
<lb />your benevolence!&mdash;Oh too lovely <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>!&mdash;
<lb />why, why must I quit you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, though she trusted not her voice to reprove
<lb />him, forced away her hand, and then, in the utmost
<lb />perturbation, he rushed out of the room.</p>
<p><lb />This scene, for <persName>Cecilia</persName>, was the most unfortunate
	    <lb />that could have happened; the gentleness of <persName>Delvile</persName>
<lb />was alone sufficient to melt her, since her pride had
<lb />no subsistence when not fed by his own; and while
<lb />his mildness had blunted her displeasure, his anguish
<lb />had penetrated her heart.  Lost in thought and in
<lb />sadness, she continued fixed to her seat; and looking
<lb />at the door through which he had passed, as if, with
<lb />himself, he had shut out all for which she existed.</p>
<p><lb />The rest of the day, and every hour of the two days
<lb />following, <persName>Cecilia</persName> passed in the most comfortless con&shy;
<lb />straint, fearful of being a moment alone, lest the hea&shy;
<lb />viness of her heart should seek relief in tears, which
<lb />consolation, melancholy as it was, she found too dan&shy;
<lb />gerous for indulgence.</p>
<p>	    <lb />On the third, letters arrived from <placeName>Bristol</placeName>:  but they
<lb />brought with them nothing of comfort, for though
	    <lb /><persName>Mortimer</persName> wrote gaily, his father sent word that his
<lb />fever seemed threatening to return.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> was now in the extremest anxiety;
<lb />and the task of <persName>Cecilia</persName> in appearing cheerful and un&shy;
<lb />concerned, became more and more difficult to per&shy;
<lb />form.</p>
<p><lb />Thus passed a week during which the news from
	    <lb /><placeName>Bristol</placeName>, being every day less and less pleasant, <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName> shewed an earnest desire, to make a journey
<pb n="564" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">171</mw>
<lb />thither herself, and proposed that <persName>Cecilia</persName> should ac&shy;
<lb />company her.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> now was in a state of the utmost distress:
	    <lb />her stay at the Castle she knew kept <persName>Delvile</persName> at a dis&shy;
	    <lb />tance, to accompany his mother to <placeName>Bristol</placeName> was forcing
<lb />herself into his sight, which equally she wished to
<lb />avoid.  All she could do, to relieve herself from a si&shy;
<lb />tuation so painful, was begging permission to make a
	    <lb />visit without delay, to her old friend, <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>,
	    <lb />in <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb />This resolution taken, she put it into immediate exe&shy;
	    <lb />cution, and seeking <persName>Mr<sic corr="s"></sic>. Delvile</persName>, enquired if she might
<lb />venture to make a petition to her?</p>
<p><lb /><q id="DL20">Undoubtedly,</q> answered she; <q id="DL21">but let it not be
<lb />very disagreeable, since I feel already that I can re&shy;
<lb />fuse you nothing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE346">I have an old friend, ma'am,</q> she cried, speaking
<lb />fast, and in much haste to have done, <q id="CE347">who I have not
<lb />for many years seen, and as <emph>my</emph> health does not require
<lb />a Bristol journey,&mdash;if you would honour me with
<lb />mentioning my request to <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, I think I might
	      <lb />take the present opportunity of making <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>
<lb />a visit.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> looked at her some time without speak&shy;
	    <lb />ing, and then, fervently embracing her, <q id="DL22">sweet <persName>Ceci&shy;
<lb />lia</persName>,</q> she cried, <q id="DL23">yes, you are all that I thought you,
<lb />good, wise, discreet, tender, and noble at once,&mdash;how
<lb />to part with you, indeed, I know not&mdash;but you shall
<lb />do as you please, for that I am sure will be right, and
<lb />therefore I will make no opposition.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> blushed and thanked her, yet saw but too

<pb n="565" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">172</mw>
<lb />comprehended.  She hastened, therefore, to write to
	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, and prepare her for her reception.</p>
<p><lb />One day was sufficient for all the preparations she
<lb />required, and as she meant to set out very early the
	    <lb />next morning, she took leave of <persName>Lady Honoria</persName>, and
	    <lb />the Lords <persName>Ernolf</persName> and <persName>Derford</persName>, when they separated

<p><lb />The sight of that Lady gave her a sensation of plea&shy;
<lb />sure to which she had long been a stranger, pleasure
<lb />pure, unmixed, unaffected and unrestrained:  it revived
<lb />all her early affection, and with it something resem&shy;
<lb />bling at least her early tranquility&mdash;again she was in
<lb />the house where it had once been undisturbed, again
<lb />she enjoyed the society which was once all she had
<lb />wished, and again saw the same scene, the same faces,
<pb n="566" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">173</mw>
<lb />and the same prospects she had beheld while her heart
<lb />was all devoted to her friends.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, though old and infirm, preserved an
<lb />understanding, which, whenever unbiassed by her af&shy;
<lb />fections, was sure to direct her unerringly; but the
<lb />extreme softness of her temper frequently misled her
<lb />judgment, by making it, at the pleasure either of mis&shy;
<lb />fortune or of artifice, always yield to compassion, and
<lb />pliant to entreaty.  Where her counsel and opinion
<lb />were demanded, they were certain to reflect honour on
<lb />her capacity and descernment; but where her assist&shy;
<lb />ance or her pity were supplicated, her purse and her
<lb />tears were immediately bestowed, and in her zeal to
<lb />alleviate distress she forgot if the object were deserv&shy;
<lb />ing her solicitude, and stopped not to consider propri&shy;
<lb />ety or discretion, if happiness, however momentary,
<lb />were in her power to grant.</p>
<p><lb />This generous foible was, however, kept somewhat
<lb />in subjection by the watchfulness of two grand-daugh&shy;
<lb />ters, who, fearing the injury they might themselves re&shy;
<lb />ceive from it, failed not to point out both its inconve&shy;
<lb />nience and its danger.</p>
<p><lb />These ladies were daughters of a deceased and only
<lb />son of Mrs. Charlton; they were single, and lived
<lb />with their grand-mother, whose fortune, which was
<lb />considerable, they expected to share between them,
<lb />and they waited with eagerness for the moment of ap&shy;
<lb />propriation; narrow-minded and rapacious, they
<lb />wished to monopolize whatever she possessed, and
<lb />thought themselves aggrieved by her smallest dona&shy;
<lb />tions.  Their chief employment was to keep from her
<lb />all objects of distress, and in this, though they could
<lb />not succeed, they at least confined her liberality to
<pb n="567" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">174</mw>
<lb />such as resembled themselves; since neither the spirit&shy;
<lb />ed could brook, nor the delicate support the checks
<lb />and rebuffs from the grand-daughters, which followed
	    <lb />the gifts of <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, of all her acquin&shy;
<lb />tance, was the only one whose intimacy they encou&shy;
<lb />raged, for they knew her fortune made her superior to
<lb />any mercenary views, and they received from her
<lb />themselves more civilities than they paid.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> loved <persName>Cecilia</persName> with an excess of fond&shy;
<lb />ness, that not only took place of the love she bore her
<lb />other friends, but to which even her regard for the
	    <lb /><name>Miss Charltons</name> was inferior and feeble.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> when
<lb />a child had reverenced her as a mother, and, grateful
<lb />for her tenderness and care, had afterwards cherished
<lb />her as a friend.  The revival of this early connection
<lb />delighted them both; it was balm to the wounded
<lb />mind of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, it was revonation to the existence of
	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Early the next morning she wrote a card to <persName>Mr.
	      <lb />Monckton</persName> and <persName>Lady Margaret</persName>, acquainting them with
	    <lb />her return into <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, and desiring to know when
<lb />she might pay her respects to her ladyship.  She re&shy;
<lb />ceived from the old lady a verbal answer, <q rend="slant(italic)pre()post()">when she
<lb />pleased</q>, but <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> came instantly himself to
	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />His astonishment, his rapture at this unexpected in&shy;
<lb />cident were almost boundless:  he thought it a sudden
<lb />turn of fortune in his own favour, and concluded, now
	    <lb />she had escaped the danger of <placeName>Delvile Castle</placeName>, the road
<lb />was short and certain that led to his own security.</p>
<p><lb />Her satisfaction in the meeting was as sincere
<lb />though not so animated as his own; but this similarity
<lb />in their feelings was of short duration, for when he
<pb n="568" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">175</mw>
<lb />enquired into what had passed at the Castle, with the
<lb />reasons of her quitting it, the pain she felt in giving
<lb />even a cursory and evasive account, was opposed on
<lb />his part by the warmest delight in hearing it:  he could
<lb />not obtain from her the particulars of what had hap&shy;
<lb />pened, but the reluctance with which she spoke, the
<lb />air of mortification with which she heard his questions,
<lb />and the evident displeasure which was mingled in her
<lb />chagrin, when he forced her to mention Delvile, were
<lb />all proofs the most indisputable and satisfactory, that
<lb />they had either parted without any explanation, or
<lb />with one by which <persName>Cecilia</persName> had been hurt and offended.</p>
<p><lb />He now readily concluded that since the fiery trial
<lb />he had most apprehended was over, and she had quit&shy;
<lb />ted in anger the asylum she had sought in ecstasy,
<lb />Delvile himself did not covet the alliance, which, since
<lb />they were separated, was never likely to take place.
<lb />He had therefore little difficulty in promising all suc&shy;
<lb />cess to himself.</p>
<p><lb />She was once more upon the spot where she had re&shy;
<lb />garded him as the first of men; he knew that during
<lb />her absence, no one had settled in the neighbourhood
<lb />who had any pretensions to dispute with him that pre&shy;
<lb />eminence; he should again have access to her at plea&shy;
<lb />sure; and so sanguine grew his hopes, that he almost
	    <lb />began to rejoice even in the partiality to <persName>Delvile</persName>, that
<lb />had hitherto been his terror, from believing it would
<lb />give her, for a time, that sullen distaste, of all other con&shy;
<lb />nections, to which those who at once are delicate and
<lb />fervent, are commonly led by early disappointment.
<lb />His whole solicitude therefore now was to preserve her
<lb />esteem, to seek her confidence, and to regain whate&shy;
<lb />ver by absence might be lost, of the ascendant over
<pb n="569" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Y4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">176</mw>
<lb />her mind which her respect for his knowledge and in&shy;
<lb />capacity had for many years given him.  Fortune at
<lb />this time seemed to prosper all his views, and, by a
<lb />stroke the most sudden and unexpected, to render
<lb />more rational his hopes and his plans, than he had
<lb />himself been able to effect by the utmost craft of
<lb />worldly wisdom.</p>
<p>	    <lb />The day following, <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in <persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>
	    <lb />chaise, waited upon <persName>Lady Margaret</persName>.  She was re&shy;
	    <lb />ceived by <persName>Miss Bennet</persName>, her companion, with the most
<lb />fawning courtesy; but when conducted to the lady of
<lb />the house, she saw herself so evidently unwelcome,
<lb />that she even regretted the civility which had prompt&shy;
<lb />ed her visit.</p>
<p>	    <lb />She found with her nobody but <persName>Mr. Morrice</persName>, who
<lb />was the only young man that could persuade himself
<lb />to endure her company in the absence of her husband,
<lb />but who, in common with most young men who are
<lb />assiduous in their attendance upon old ladies, doubted
<lb />not but he ensured himself a handsome legacy for his
<lb />trouble.</p>
<p><lb />Almost the first speech which her ladyship made,
	    <lb />was, <q>So you are not married yet, I find; if <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> had been a real friend, he would have taken
<lb />care to have seen for some establishment for you.</q></p>
<p><lb />Here they were joined by <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> and some
<lb />gentlemen who were on a visit at his house; for his
<lb />anxiety was not of a sort to lead him to solitude, nor
<lb />his disposition to make him deny himself any kind of
<lb />enjoyment which he had power to attain.  A general
<lb />conversation ensued, which lasted till <persName>Cecilia</persName> ended
<lb />her visit; <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> then took her hand to lead
<lb />her to the chaise, but told her, in their way out, of
<pb n="570" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">177</mw>
<lb />some alterations in his grounds, which he desired to
<lb />shew her:  his view of detaining her was to gather
<lb />what she thought of her reception, and whether she
	    <lb />had yet any suspicions of the jealousy of <persName>Lady Mar&shy;
<lb />garet</persName>; well knowing, from the delicacy of her charac&shy;
<lb />ter, that if once she became acquainted with it, she
<lb />would scrupulously avoid all intercourse with him,
<lb />from the fear of increasing her uneasiness.</p>
<p><lb />He began, therefore, with talking of the pleasure
	    <lb />which <persName>Lady Margaret</persName> took in the plantations, and of
<lb />his hope that <persName>Cecilia</persName> would often favour her by visit&shy;
<lb />ing them, without waiting to have her visits returned,
<lb />as she was entitled by her infirmities to particular in&shy;
<lb />dulgencies.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, in quitting the house, determined
<lb />not to visit it again very speedily; for she was ex&shy;
	    <lb />tremely disgusted with <persName>Lady Margaret</persName>, though she
<lb />suspected no particular motives of enmity, against
<lb />which she was guarded alike by her own unsuspicious
<lb />innocence, and by a high esteem of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>,
<lb />which she firmly believed he returned with equal ho&shy;
<lb />nesty of undesigning friendhip.</p></div>

<lb />One week only, however, had yet tried the perseve&shy;
<lb />rance of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, when, while she was working with
	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> in her dressing-room, her maid hastily

<pb n="571" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z1v" />

<lb />entered, and with a smile that seemed announcing
	    <lb />welcome news, said, <q>Lord, ma'am, here's <persName>Fidel</persName>!</q>
<lb />and, at the same moment, she was followed by the
<lb />dog, who jumped upon <persName>Cecilia</persName> in a transport of
<lb />delight!</p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE348">Good heaven,</q> cried she, all amazement, <q id="CE349">who
<lb />has brought him? whence does he come?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>A countryman brought him, ma'am; but he only
<lb />put him in, and would not stay a minute.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But whom did he enquire for?&mdash;who saw him?&mdash;
<lb />what did he say?</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>He saw <persName>Ralph</persName>, ma'am.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Ralph</persName>, then, was instantly called:  and these ques&shy;
<lb />tions being repeated, he said, <q>Ma'am, it was a man
<lb />I never saw before; but he only bid me take care to
<lb />deliver the dog into your own hands, and said you
<lb />would have a letter about him soon, and then went
<lb />away:  I wanted him to stay till I came up stairs, but
<lb />he was off at once.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, quite confounded by this account, could
<lb />make neither comment nor answer; but, as soon as
	    <lb />the servants had left the room, <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> entreated
<lb />to know to whom the dog had belonged, convinced
<lb />by her extreme agitation, that something interesting
<lb />and uncommon must relate to him.</p>
<p><lb />This was no time for disguise; astonishment and
<lb />confusion bereft <persName>Cecilia</persName> of all power to attempt it;
<lb />and after a very few evasions, she briefly communi&shy;
	    <lb />cated her situation with respect to <persName>Delvile</persName>, his leaving
<lb />her, his motives, and his mother's evident concur&shy;
<lb />rence:  for these were all so connected with her
	    <lb />knowledge of <persName>Fidel</persName>, that she led to them unavoidably
<lb />in telling what she knew of him.</p>
<pb n="572" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">179</mw>
<p>
<lb />Very little penetration was requisite, to gather from
<lb />her manner all that was omitted in her narrative, of
<lb />her own feelings and disappointment in the course of
	    <lb />this affair:  and <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, who hitherto be&shy;
<lb />lieved the whole world at her disposal, and that she
<lb />continued single from no reason but her own difficulty
<lb />of choice, was utterly amazed to find that any man
<lb />existed, who could withstand the allurements of so
<lb />much beauty, sweetness, and fortune.  She felt herself
<lb />sometimes inclined to hate, and at other times to pity
<lb />him; yet concluded that her own extreme coldness
<lb />was the real cause of his flight, and warmly blamed a
<lb />reserve which has thus ruined her happiness.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was in the extremest perplexity and distress
<lb />to conjecture the meaning of so unaccountable a pre&shy;
	    <lb />sent, and so strange a message.  <persName>Delvile</persName>, she knew
	    <lb />had desired the dog might follow him to <placeName>Bristol</placeName>:  his
<lb />mother, always pleased to oblige him, would now less
<lb />than ever neglect any opportunity:  she could not,
<lb />therefore, doubt that she had sent or taken him thither,
<lb />and thence, according to all appearances, he must now
	    <lb />come.  But was it likely <persName>Delvile</persName> would take such a
<lb />liberty?  Was it probable, when so lately he had al&shy;
<lb />most exhorted her to forget him, he would even wish
<lb />to present her with such a remembrance of himself?
<lb />And what was the letter she was bid to expect?
<lb />Whence and from whom was it to come?</p>
<p><lb />All was inexplicable! the only thing she could sur&shy;
<lb />mise, with any semblance of probability was, that the
	    <lb />whole was some frolic of <persName>Lady Honoria Pemberton</persName>,
	    <lb />who had persuaded <persName>Delvile</persName> to send her the dog, and
<lb />perhaps assured him she had herself requested to have
<lb />him.</p>
<pb n="573" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">180</mw>
<p>
<lb />Provoked by this suggestion, her first thought was
<lb />instantly having him conveyed to the castle; but un&shy;
<lb />certain what the whole affair meant, and hoping some
<lb />explanation in the letter she was promised, she deter&shy;
<lb />mined to wait till it came, or at least till she heard
<lb />from <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, before she took any measures her&shy;
<lb />self in the business.  Mutual accounts of their safe ar&shy;
	    <lb />rivals at <placeName>Bristol</placeName> and in <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, had already passed
<lb />between them, and she expected very soon to have
<lb />further intelligence:  though she was now, by the whole
<lb />behaviour of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>, convinced she wished not
<lb />again to have her an inmate of her house, and that the
<lb />rest of her minority might pass, without opposition, in
	    <lb />the house of <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />Day after day, however, passed, and yet she heard
<lb />nothing more; a week, a fortnight elapsed, and still no
<lb />letter came.  She now concluded the promise was a
<lb />deception, and repented that she had waited a moment
<lb />with any such expectation.  Her peace, during this
<lb />time, was greatly disturbed; this present made her fear
<lb />she was thought meanly of by <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>; the silence
<lb />of his mother gave her apprehensions for his health,
<lb />and her own irresolution how to act, kept her in per&shy;
<lb />petual inquietude.  She tried in vain to behave as if
<lb />this incident had not happened; her mind was uneasy,
<lb />and the same actions produced not the same effects;
	    <lb />when she now worked or read, the sight of <persName>Fidel</persName> by
<lb />her side distracted her attention; when she walked it
	    <lb />was the same, for <persName>Fidel</persName> always followed her; and
<lb />though, in visiting her old acquaintance she forbore to
<lb />let him accompany her, she was secretly planning the
<lb />whole time the contents of some letter, which she ex&shy;
	    <lb />pected to meet with, on returning to <persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>.</p>
<pb n="574" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">181</mw>
<p>
<lb />Those gentlemen in the country, who, during the
	    <lb />life-time of the Dean, had paid their addresses to <persName>Ce&shy;
	      <lb />cilia</persName>, again waited upon her at <persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>, and
<lb />renewed their proposals.  They had now, however,
<lb />still less chance of success, and their dismission was
<lb />brief and decisive.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Among these came <persName>Mr. Biddulph</persName>; and to him Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia was involuntarily most civil, because she knew
	    <lb />him to be the friend of <persName>Delvile</persName>.  Yet his conversation
<lb />increased the uneasiness of her suspense; for after
<lb />speaking of the family in general which she had left,
	    <lb />he enquired more particularly concerning <persName>Delvile</persName>, and
<lb />then added, <q>I am, indeed, greatly grieved to find, by
<lb />all the accounts I receive of him, that he is now in a
<lb />very bad state of health.</q></p>
<p><lb />This speech gave her fresh subject for apprehension;
<lb />and in proportion as the silence of <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> grew
	    <lb />more alarming, her regard for her favourite <persName>Fidel</persName> be&shy;
<lb />came more partial.  The affectionate animal seemed
<lb />to mourn the loss of his master, and while sometimes
<lb />she indulged herself in fancifully telling him her fears,
<lb />she imagined she read in his counteneace the faithfullest
<lb />sympathy.</p>
<p><lb />One week of her minority was now all that remain&shy;
<lb />ed, and she was soon wholly occupied in preparations
<lb />for coming of age.  She purposed taking possession of
<lb />a large house that had belonged to her uncle, which
	    <lb />was situated only three miles from that of <persName>Mrs. Charl&shy;
<lb />ton</persName>; and she employed herself in giving orders for
<lb />fitting it up, and in hearing complaints, and promising
<lb />indulgencies, to various of her tenants.</p></div>

<p rend="indent(0)">
<lb />The spirits of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, however, internally failed her,
	    <lb />she considered her separation from <persName>Delvile</persName> to be now,
<lb />in all probability, for life, since she saw that no strug&shy;
<lb />gle either of interest, inclination, or health, could bend
<lb />him from his purpose; his mother, too, seemed to re&shy;
<lb />gard his name and his existence as equally valuable,
<lb />and the scruples of his father she was certain would
<lb />be still more insurmountable.  Her own pride, excited
<lb />by theirs, made her, indeed, with more anger than
<lb />sorrow, see this general consent to abandon her; but
<lb />pride and anger both failed when she considered the
<lb />situation of his health; sorrow, there, took the lead,
<lb />and admitted no partner:  it represented him to her
<lb />not only as lost to herself, but to the world; and so
<lb />sad grew her reflections, and so heavy her heart, that,
	    <lb />to avoid from <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> observations which pain&shy;
<lb />ed her, she stole into a summer-house in the garden
<lb />the moment she had done tea, declining any compa&shy;
	    <lb />nion but her affectionate <persName>Fidel</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />Her tenderness and her sorrow found here a roman&shy;
<lb />tic consolation, in complaining to him of the absence
<lb />of his master, his voluntary exile, and her fears for his
<lb />health:  calling upon him to participate in her sorrow,
<lb />and lamenting that even this little relief would soon
<pb n="576" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">183</mw>
	    <lb />be denied her; and that in losing <persName>Fidel</persName> no vestige of
	    <lb /><persName>Mortimer</persName>, but in her own breast, would remain:
	    <lb /><q id="CE350">Go, then, dear <persName>Fidel</persName>,</q> she cried, <q id="CE351">carry back to
<lb />your master all that nourishes his remembrance!  Bid
<lb />him not love you the less for having some time be&shy;
<lb />longed to <persName>Cecilia</persName>; but never may his proud heart be
<lb />fed with the vain-glory, of knowing how fondly for
	      <lb />his sake she has cherished you!  Go, dear <persName>Fidel</persName>,
<lb />guard him by night, and follow him by day; serve
<lb />him with zeal, and love him with fidelity:&mdash;Oh that
<lb />his health were invincible as his pride!&mdash;there, alone,
<lb />is he vulnerable&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />Here <persName>Fidel</persName>, with a loud barking, suddenly sprang
<lb />away from her, and as she turned her eyes towards
<lb />the door to see what had thus startled him, she beheld
<lb />standing there, as if immoveable, young <persName>Delvile</persName> him&shy;
<lb />self!</p>
<p><lb />Her astonishment at this sight almost bereft her of
<lb />her understanding; it appeared to her supernatural,
<lb />and she rather believed it was his ghost than himself.
<lb />Fixed in mute wonder, she stood still though terrified,
<lb />her eyes almost bursting from their sockets to be sa&shy;
<lb />tisfied if what they saw was real.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, too, was some time speechless; he looked
<lb />not at her, indeed, with any doubt of her existence,
<lb />but as if what he had heard was to him as amazing as
<lb />to her what she saw.  At length, however, tormented
<lb />by the dog, who jumped up to him, licked his hands,
<lb />and by his rapturous joy forced himself into notice, he
<lb />was moved to return his caresses, saying, <q>Yes, dear
<lb />Fidel! you have a claim indeed to my attention, and
<lb />with the fondest gratitude will I cherish you ever!</q></p>
<p><lb />At the sound of his voice, <persName>Cecilia</persName> again began to
<pb n="577" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="Z4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">184</mw>
	    <lb />breathe; and <persName>Delvile</persName> having quieted the dog, now
<lb />entered the summer-house, saying, as he advanced,
<lb /><q>Is this possible!&mdash;am I not in a dream?&mdash;Good
<lb />God! is it indeed possible?</q></p>
<p><lb />The consternation of doubt and astonishment which
<lb />had seized every faculty of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, now changed into
	    <lb />certainty that <persName>Delvile</persName> indeed was present; all her re&shy;
<lb />collection returned as she listened to this question, and
<lb />the wild rambling of fancy with which she and incau&shy;
<lb />tiously indulged her sorrow, rushing suddenly upon
<lb />her mind, she felt herself wholly overpowered by con&shy;
<lb />sciousness and shame, and sunk, almost fainting, upon
<lb />a window-seat.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> instantly flew to her, penetrated with grati&shy;
<lb />tude, and filled with wonder and delight, which, how&shy;
<lb />ever internally combated by sensations less pleasant,
<lb />were too potent for control, and he poured forth at
<lb />her feet the most passionate acknowledgments.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, surprised, affected, and trembling with a
<lb />thousand emotions, endeavoured to break from him and
	    <lb />rise; but, eagerly detaining her, <q id="MO100">No, loveliest <persName>Miss
<lb />Beverley</persName>,</q> he cried, <q id="MO101">not thus must we now part! this
<lb />moment only have I discovered what a treasure I was
	      <lb />leaving; and, but for <persName>Fidel</persName>, I had quitted it in igno&shy;

<lb /><q id="CE354">O heaven!</q> interrupted <persName>Cecilia</persName>, in an agony of
<lb />mortification and shame, <q id="CE355">to what has my unguarded
<lb />folly reduced me!</q>  Then again endeavouring to break
<lb />from him, <q id="CE356">Leave me, <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>,</q> she cried, <q id="CE357">leave

<p>	    <lb /><q id="MO104">Come, <emph>dear <persName>Fidel</persName>!</emph></q> cried he, still detaining her,
<lb /><q id="MO105">come and plead for your master! come and ask in

<lb />is invincible!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE358">Oh go!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, looking away from him

<p><lb /><q id="MO106">Ever-lovely <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> cried he, more seri&shy;

<lb />distress? has not my heart long since been known to
<lb />you? have you not witnessed its sufferings, and been
<lb />assured of its tenderness, why, then, this untimely re&shy;
<lb />serve? this unabating coldness?  Oh why try to rob

<lb />recollection! there is no punishment, indeed, which my

<p><lb /><q>Why will you talk thus, my beloved <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>?
<lb />what have you done,&mdash;what, let me ask, have <emph>I</emph> done,
<lb />that such infinite disgrace and depression should fol&shy;
<lb />low this little sensibility to a passion so fervent?  Does
<lb />it not render you more dear to me than ever? does it
<lb />not add new life, new vigour, to the devotion by which
<lb />I am bound to you?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE364">No, no,</q> cried the mortified <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who from
<lb />the moment she found herself betrayed, believed her&shy;
<lb />self to be lost, <q id="CE365">far other is the effect it will have!
<lb />and the same mad folly by which I am ruined in my

<lb />&mdash;You have filled me with anguish and mortification,

<lb />hating and contemning myself!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO110">Good heaven,</q> cried he, much hurt, <q id="MO111">what
<lb />strange apprehensions thus terrify you? are you with
<lb />me less safe than with yourself? is it my honour you
<lb />doubt? is it my integrity you fear?  Surely I cannot
<lb />be so little known to you; and to make protestations
<lb />now would but give a new alarm to a delicacy already
<lb />too agitated.&mdash;&mdash;Else would I tell you that more sa&shy;
<lb />cred than my life will I hold what I have heard, that
<lb />the words just now graven on my heart, shall remain
<lb />there to eternity unseen; and that higher than ever,
<lb />not only in my love, but my esteem, is the beautiful
<lb />speaker&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE366">Ah no!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with a sigh, <q id="CE367">that at least
<pb n="580" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">189</mw>
<lb />is impossible, for lower than ever is she sunk from de&shy;
<lb />serving it!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO112">No,</q> cried he, with fervour, <q id="MO113">she is raised, she is
<lb />exalted!  I find her more excellent and perfect than
<lb />I had even dared believe her; I discover new virtues
<lb />in the spring of every action; I see what I took for
<lb />indifference, was dignity; I perceive what I imagined
<lb />the most rigid insensibility, was nobleness, was pro&shy;
<lb />priety, was true greatness of mind!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> was somewhat appeased by this speech;
<lb />and, after a little hesitation, she said with a half-smile,
<lb /><q>Must I thank you for this good-nature, in seeking to
<lb />reconcile me with myself?&mdash;or shall I quarrel with you
<lb />for flattery, in giving me praise you can so little think
<lb />I merit?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO114">Ah!</q> cried he, <q id="MO115">were I to praise as I think of
<lb />you! were my language permitted to accord with my
<lb />opinion of your worth, you would not then simply call
<lb />me a flatterer, you would tell me, I was an idolater,
<lb />and fear at least for my principles, if not for my un&shy;
<lb />derstanding.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE368">I shall have but little right, however,</q> said Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia, again rising, <q id="CE369">to arraign your understanding
<lb />while I act as if bereft of my own.  Now, at least,
<lb />let me pass; indeed you will greatly displease me by
<lb />any further opposition.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Will you suffer me, then, to see you early to-mor&shy;
<lb />row morning?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir; nor the next morning, nor the morning
<lb />after that!  This meeting has been wrong, another
<lb />would be worse; in this I have accusation enough for
<lb />folly;&mdash;in another the charge would be far more heavy.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO116">Does <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, then,</q> cried he, gravely,

<milestone unit="sig" n="2A2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">190</mw>
<lb /><q id="MO117">think me capable of desiring to see her for mere self&shy;
<lb />ish gratification? of intending to trifle either with her
<lb />time or her feelings? no; the conference I desire will
<lb />be important and decisive.  This night I shall devote
<lb />solely to deliberation; to-morrow shall be given to
<lb />aciton.  Without some thinking, I dare venture at no
<lb />plan;&mdash;I presume not to communicate to you the va&shy;
<lb />rious interests that divide me, but the result of them
<lb />all I can take no denial to your hearing.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, who felt when thus stated the justice of his
<lb />request, now opposed it no longer, but insisted upon
<lb />his instantly departing.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO118">True,</q> cried he, <q id="MO119">I must go!&mdash;the longer I stay,
<lb />the more I am fascinated, and the weaker are those
<lb />reasoning powers of which I now want the strongest
<lb />exertion.</q>  He then repeated his professions of eternal
<lb />regard, besought her not to regret the happiness she
<lb />had given him, and after disobeying her injunctions of
<lb />going till she was seriously displeased, he only staid to
<lb />obtain her pardon, and permission to be early the next
<lb />morning, and then, though still slowly and reluctantly,
<lb />he left her.</p>
<p><lb />Scarce was <persName>Cecilia</persName> again alone, but the whole of
<lb />what had passed seemed a vision of her imagination.
	    <lb />That <persName>Delvile</persName> should be at Bury, that he should visit
	    <lb />her at <persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>, surprise her by herself, and
<lb />discover her most secret thoughts, appeared so strange
<lb />and so incredible, that occupied rather by wonder than
<lb />thinking, she continued almost motionless in the place
	    <lb />where he had left her, till <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> sent to request
<lb />that she would return to the house.  She then enquired
<lb />if any body was with her, and being answered in the
<lb />negative, obeyed the summons.</p>
<pb n="582" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">191</mw>
<p>
	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, with a smile of much meaning,
<lb />hoped she had had a pleasant walk:  but <persName>Cecilia</persName> se&shy;
<lb />riously remonstrated on the dangerous imprudence
<lb />she had committed in suffering her to be so unguard&shy;
	    <lb />edly surprised.  <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, however, more anxious
<lb />for her future and solid happiness, than for her present
<lb />apprehensions and delicacy, repented not the step she
<lb />had taken; and when she gathered from <persName>Cecilia</persName> the
<lb />substance of what had past, unmindful of the expos&shy;
<lb />tulations which accompanied it, she thought with ex&shy;
<lb />ultation that the sudden meeting she had permitted,
<lb />would now, by making known to each their mutual
<lb />affection, determine them to defer no longer a union
<lb />upon which their mutual peace of mind so much de&shy;
<lb />pended.  And <persName>Cecilia</persName>, finding she had been thus be&shy;
<lb />trayed designedly, not inadvertently, could hardly
<lb />reproach her zeal, though she lamented its indiscretion.</p>
<p><lb />She then asked by what means he had obtained ad&shy;
<lb />mission, and made himself known; and heard that he
<lb />had enquired at the door for <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, and hav&shy;
<lb />ing sent in his name, was shewn into the parlour,
	    <lb />where <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, much pleased with his appear&shy;
<lb />ance, had suddenly conceived the little plan which he
<lb />had executed, of contriving a surprise for <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />from which she rationally expected the very conse&shy;
<lb />quences that ensued, though the immediate means she
<lb />had not conjectured.</p>
<p><lb />The account was still unsatisfactory to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who
<lb />could frame to herself no possible reason for a visit so
<lb />extraordinary, and so totally inconsistent with his de<sic corr="-"></sic>
<lb />clarations and resolutions.</p>
<p><lb />This, however, was a matter but of little moment,
<lb />compared with the other subjects to which the inter&shy;
<pb n="583" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">192</mw>
	    <lb />view had given rise:  <persName>Delvile</persName>, upon whom so long,
<lb />though secretly, her dearest hopes of happiness had
<lb />rested, was now become acquainted with his power,
<lb />and knew himself the master of her destiny; he had
<lb />quitted her avowedly to decide what it should be,
<lb />since his present subject of deliberation included her
<lb />fate in his own; the next morning he was to call, and
<lb />acquaint her with his decree, not doubting her concur&shy;
<lb />rence which ever way he resolved.</p>
<p><lb />A subjection so undue, and which she could not but
<lb />consider as disgraceful, both shocked and afflicted her;
<lb />and the reflection that the man who of all men she pre&shy;
<lb />ferred, was acquainted with her preference, yet hesi&shy;
<lb />tated whether to accept or abandon her, mortified and
<lb />provoked her alternately, occupied her thoughts the
<lb />whole night, and kept her from peace and from rest.</p></div>

<lb />Early the next morning, Delvile made his ap&shy;
	    <lb />pearance.  <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who was at breakfast with <persName>Mrs</persName>.
	    <lb />and <persName>Miss Charlton's</persName>, received him with the most pain&shy;
<lb />ful confusion, and he was evidently himself in a state
	    <lb />of the utmost perturbation.  <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> made a
<lb />pretence almost immediately for sending away both
<lb />her grand-daughters, and then, without taking the
<lb />trouble of devising one for herself, arose and followed
<pb n="584" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2A4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">193</mw>
<lb />them, though <persName>Cecilia</persName> made sundry signs of solicitation
<lb />that she would stay.</p>
<p><lb />He now advanced to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, who pretended to be
<lb />looking at some work, and seating himself next her,
<lb /><q id="MO120">when we parted yesterday,</q> he cried, <q id="MO121">I presumed
<lb />to say one night alone should be given for delibera&shy;
<lb />tion,&mdash;and to day, this very day to action!&mdash;but I for&shy;
<lb />got that though in deliberating I had only myself to
<lb />consult, in acting I was not so independent:  and that
<lb />when my own doubts were satisfied, and my own re&shy;
<lb />solutions taken, other doubts and other resolutions must
<lb />be considered, by which my purposed proceedings
<lb />might be retarded, might perhaps be wholly pre&shy;
<lb />vented!</q></p>
<p><lb />He paused, but <persName>Cecilia</persName>, unable to conjecture to what
<lb />he was leading, made not any answer.</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO122">Upon you, Madam,</q> he continued, <q id="MO123">all that is
<lb />good or evil of my future life, as far as relates to its
<lb />happiness or misery, will, from this very hour, almost
<lb />solely depend:  yet much as I rely upon your goodness,
<lb />and superior as I know you to trifling or affectation,
<lb />what I now come to propose&mdash;to petition&mdash;to entreat
<lb />&mdash;I cannot summon courage to mention, from a dread
<lb />of alarming you!</q></p>
<p><lb />What next, thought <persName>Cecilia</persName>, trembling at this intro&shy;
<lb />duction, is preparing for me! does he mean to ask <emph>me</emph>
<lb />to solicit <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>'s consent! or from myself must
<lb />he receive commands that we should never meet more!</p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO124">Is <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>,</q> cried he, <q id="MO125">determined not to
<lb />speak to me?  Is she bent upon silence only to intimi&shy;
<lb />date me?  Indeed if she knew how greatly I respect
<lb />her, she would honour me with more confidence.</q></p>
<pb n="585" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">194</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q id="CE370">When, Sir, </q>cried she, <q id="CE371">do you mean to make
<lb />your tour?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO126">Never!</q> cried he, with fervour, <q id="MO127">unless banished
<lb />by <emph>you</emph>, never!&mdash;no, loveliest <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I can now
<lb />quit you no more!</q>  Fortune, beauty, worth and
<lb />sweetness I had power to relinquish, and severe as
<lb />was the task, I compelled myself to perform it,&mdash;but
<lb />when to these I find joined so attractive a softness,&mdash;
<lb />a pity for my sufferings so unexpectedly gentle&mdash;&mdash;
<lb /><q>no! sweetest <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, I can quit you no more!</q>
<lb />And then, seizing her hand with yet greater energy,
<lb />he went on, <q id="MO128">I here,</q> he cried, <q id="MO129">offer you my vows,
<lb />I here own you sole arbitress of my fate!  I give you
<lb />not merely the possession of my heart,&mdash;that, indeed,
<lb />I had no power to with-hold from you,&mdash;but I give you
<lb />the direction of my conduct, I entreat you to become
<lb />my counsellor and guide.  Will <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> accept
<lb />such an office?  Will she deign to listen to such a
<lb />prayer?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE372">Yes,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, involuntarily delighted to find
<lb />that such was the result of his night's deliberation, <q id="CE373">I
<lb />am most ready to give you my counsel; which I now
<lb />do,&mdash;that you set off for the continent to-morrow
<lb />morning.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO130">O how malicious!</q> cried he, half laughing, <q id="MO131">yet
<lb />not so immediately do I even request your counsel;
<lb />something must first be done to qualify you for giving
<lb />it:  penetration, skill and understanding, however am&shy;
<lb />ply you possess them, are not sufficient to fit you for
<lb />the charge; something still more is requisite, you must
<lb />be invested with fuller powers, you must have a right
<lb />less disputable, and a title, that not alone inclination,
<lb />nor even judgment alone must sanctify,&mdash;but which
<pb n="586" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">193</mw>
<lb />law must enforce, and rites the most solemn sup&shy;
<lb />port!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE374">I think, then,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, deeply blushing, <q id="CE375">I
<lb />must be content to forbear giving any counsel at all,
<lb />if the qualifications for it are so difficult of acquire&shy;
<lb />ment.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO132">Resent not my presumption,</q> cried he, <q id="MO133">my be&shy;
<lb />loved <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, but let the severity of my recent
<lb />sufferings palliate my present temerity, for where
<lb />affliction has been deep and serious, causeless and
<lb />unnecessary misery will find little encouragement;
<lb />and mine has been serious indeed!  Sweetly, then, per&shy;
<lb />mit me, in proportion to its bitterness, to rejoice in the
<lb />soft reverse which now flatters me with its ap&shy;
<lb />proach.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, abashed and uneasy, uncertain of what was
<lb />to follow, and unwilling to speak till more assured,
<lb />paused, and then abruptly exclaimed, <q>I am afraid
	      <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> is waiting for me,</q> and would have
<lb />hurried away:  but Delvile, almost forcibly prevent&shy;
<lb />ing her, compelled her to stay; and after a short con&shy;
<lb />versation, on his side the most impassioned, and on
<lb />her's the most confused, obtained from her, what,
<lb />indeed, after the surprise of the preceding evening,
<lb />she could but ill deny, a frank confirmation of his
<lb />power over her heart, and an ingenuous, though reluc&shy;
<lb />tant acknowledgment how long he had possessed it.</p>
<p><lb />This confession, made, as affairs now stood, wholly
<lb />in opposition to her judgment, was torn from her by
<lb />an impetuous urgency which she had not presence of
	    <lb />mind to resist, and with which <persName>Delvile</persName>, when particu&shy;
<lb />larly animated, had long been accustomed to overpower
<lb />all opposition.  The joy with which he heard it,

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">194</mw>
<lb />though but little mixed with wonder, was as violent
<lb />as the eagerness with which he had sought it; yet it
<lb />was not of long duration, a sudden and most painful
<lb />recollection presently quelled it, and even in the midst
<lb />of his rapturous acknowledgments, seemed to strike
<lb />him to the heart.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, soon perceiving both in his countenance
<lb />and manner an alteration that shocked her, bitterly
<lb />repented an avowal she could never recall, and looked
<lb />aghast with expectation and dread.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, who with quickness saw a change of expres&shy;
<lb />sion in her of which in himself he was unconscious, ex&shy;
<lb />claimed with much emotion, <q>Oh how transient is
<lb />human felicity!  How rapidly fly those rare and ex&shy;
<lb />quisite moments in which it is perfect!  Ah! sweetest
<lb /><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, what words shall I find to soften what
<lb />I have now to reveal! to tell you that after goodness,
<lb />candour, generosity such as yours, a request, a sup&shy;
<lb />plication remains yet to be uttered, that banishes me,
<lb />if refused, from your presence for ever!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, extremely dismayed, desired to know what
<lb />it was:  an evident dread of offending her kept him
<lb />some time from proceeding, but at length, after repeat&shy;
<lb />edly expressing his fears of her disapprobation, and a
<lb />repugnance even on his own part to the very measure
<lb />he was obliged to urge, he acknowledged that all his
<lb />hopes of being ever united to her, rested upon obtain&shy;
<lb />ing her consent to an immediate and secret marriage.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, thunderstruck by this declaration, remained
<lb />for a few instants too much confounded to speak; but
<lb />when he was beginning an explanatory apology, she
<lb />started up, and glowing with indignation, said, <q>I had
<lb />flattered myself, Sir, that both my character and my
<pb n="588" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">195</mw>
<lb />conduct, independent of my situation in life, would
<lb />have exempted me at all times from a proposal which
<lb />I shall ever think myself degraded by having heard.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />And then she was again going, but <persName>Delvile</persName> still pre&shy;
<lb />venting her, said, <q>I knew too well how much you
<lb />would be alarmed, and such was my dread of your
<lb />displeasure, that it had power even to embitter the
<lb />happiness I sought with so much earnestness, and to
<lb />render your condescension insufficient to ensure it.
<lb />Yet wonder not at my scheme; wild as it may appear,
<lb />it is the result of deliberation; and censurable as it
<lb />may seem, it springs not form unworthy motives.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE376">Whatever may be your motives with respect to
<lb />yourself, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q id="CE377">
 with respect to me they
<lb />must certainly be disgraceful; I will not, therefore,
<lb />listen to them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO134">You wrong me cruelly,</q> cried he, with warmth,
<lb /><q id="MO135">and a moment's reflection must tell you that however
<lb />distinct may be our honour or our disgrace in every
<lb />other instance, in that by which we should be united,
<lb />they must inevitably be the same:  and far sooner
<lb />would I involuntarily relinquish you, than be myself
<lb />accessary to tainting that delicacy of which the un&shy;
<lb />sullied purity has been the chief soulrce of my admira&shy;
<lb />tion.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE378">Why, then,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, reproachfully, <q id="CE379">have
<lb />you mentioned to me such a project?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO136">Circumstances the most singular, and necessity
<lb />the most unavoidable,</q> he answered, <q id="MO137">should alone
<lb />have ever tempted me to form it.  No longer ago than
<lb />yesterday morning, I believed myself incapable of even
<lb />wishing it; but extraordinary situations call for extra&shy;
<lb />ordinary resolutions, and in private as well as public
<pb n="589" />

<lb />life, palliate, at least, extraordinary actions.  Alas! the
<lb />proposal which so much offends you is my final re&shy;
<lb />source! it is the sole barrier between myself and per&shy;
<lb />petual misery!&mdash;the only expedient in my power to
<lb />save me from eternally parting with you!&mdash;for I am
<lb />now cruelly compelled to confess, that my family, I
<lb />am certain, will never consent to our union!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE380">Neither, then, Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with great spirit,
<lb /><q id="CE381">will I!  The disdain I may meet with I pretend not to
<lb />retort, but wilfully to encounter were meanly to deserve
<lb />it.  I will enter into no family in opposition to its
<lb />wishes, I will consent to no alliance that may expose
<lb />me to indignity.  Nothing is so contagious as con&shy;
<lb />tempt!&mdash;The example of your friends might work
<lb />powerfully upon yourself, and who shall dare assure
<lb />me you would not catch the infection?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="MO138">I dare assure you?</q> cried he; <q id="MO139">hasty you may
<lb />perhaps think me, and somewhat impetuous I cannot
<lb />deny myself; but believe me not of so wretched a cha&shy;
<lb />racter as to be capable, in any affair of moment, of
<lb />fickleness or caprice.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But what, Sir, is my security to the contrary?
<lb />Have you not this moment avowed that but yesterday
<lb />you held in abhorrence the very plan that to-day you
<lb />propose? and may you not to-morrow resume again
<lb />the same opinion?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Cruel <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>; how unjust is this inference!
<lb />if yesterday I disapproved what to-day I recommend,
<lb />a little recollection must surely tell you why:  and that
<lb />not my opinion, but my situation is changed.</q></p>
<p><lb />The conscious <persName>Cecilia</persName> here turned away her head:
<lb />too certain he had alluded to the discovery of her par&shy;
<lb />tiality.</p>

<lb /><q id="MO140">Have you not yourself,</q> he continued, <q id="MO141">witnessed
<lb />the steadiness of my mind?  Have you not beheld me
<lb />fly, when I had power to pursue, and avoid, when I
<lb />had opportunity to seek you?  After witnessing my
<lb />constancy upon such trying occasions, is it equitable,
<lb />is it right to suspect me of wavering?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE382">But what,</q> cried she, <q id="CE383">was the constancy which

<p><lb /><q id="CE384">Ah!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, blushing, <q id="CE385">'tis some trick of

<p><lb /><q>No, upon my honour.  The authority is less

<lb />letter, and looking first at the end, was much asto&shy;
	    <lb />nished to see the name of <persName>Biddulph</persName>.  She then cast
<lb />her eye over the beginning, and when she saw her own
<lb />name, read the following paragraph:</p>
<p><lb /><q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, as you doubtless know, is returned
	      <lb />into <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>; every body here saw her with the ut&shy;
<lb />most surprise:  from the moment I had heard of her
	      <lb />residence in <placeName>Delvile Castle</placeName>, I had given her up for lost:
<lb />but, upon her unexpected appearance among us again,
<lb />I was weak enough once more to make trial of her
<lb />heart.  I soon found, however, that the pain of a se&shy;
<lb />cond rejection <emph>you</emph> might have spared me, and that

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">198</mw>
	      <lb />though she had quitted <placeName>Delvile Castle</placeName>, she had not for
<lb />nothing entered it:  at the sound of your name, she
<lb />blushes; at the mention of your illness, she turns pale;
<lb />and the dog you have given her, which I recollected
<lb />immediately, is her darling companion.  Oh happy
<lb />Delvile, yet so lovely a conquest you abandon&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> could read no more; the letter dropt from
<lb />her hand:  to find herself thus by her own emotions be&shy;
<lb />trayed, made her instantly conclude she was universally
<lb />discovered:  and turning sick at the supposition, all
<lb />her spirit forsook her, and she burst into tears.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q id="MO144">Good heaven,</q> cried <persName>Delvile</persName>, extremely shocked,

<p><lb /><q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()" id="CE388">Never, never!</q> cried she with earnestness, <q id="CE389">I am

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">199</mw>
<lb />order to work upon your sensibility.  My desire is
<lb />not to surprise, but to reconcile you to my plan.  What
<lb />is it I seek in <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>?  An heiress?  No, as such
<lb />she has seen I could resist her; nor yet the light trifler
<lb />of a spring or two, neglected when no longer a novelty;
<lb />no,no!&mdash;it is a companion for ever, it is a solace for
<lb />every care, it is a bosom friend through every period
<lb />of life that I seek in <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>!  Her esteem,
<lb />therefore, to me is as precious as her affection, for how
<lb />can I hope her friendship in the winter of my days, if
<lb />their brighter and gayer season is darkened by doubts
<lb />of my integrity?  All shall be clear and explicit; no
<lb />latent cause of uneasiness shall disturb our future
<lb />quiet:  we will now be sincere, that hereafter we may
<lb />be easy; and sweetly in unclouded felicity, time shall
<lb />glide away imperceptibly, and we will make an inter&shy;
<lb />est with each other in the gaity of youth, to bear with
<lb />the infirmities of age, and alleviate them by kindness
<lb />and sympathy.  And then shall my soothing <persName>Cecilia</persName>&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q id="CE390">O say no more!</q> interrupted she, softened in her
<lb />own despite by a plan so consonant to her wishes,
<lb /><q id="CE391">what language is this! how improper for you to use,
<lb />or me to hear!</q></p>
<p><lb />She then very earnestly insisted upon his going; and
<lb />after a thousand times taking leave and returning,
<lb />promising obedience, and yet pursuing his own way,
<lb />he at length said, if she would consent to receive a
<lb />letter from him, he would endeavour to commit what
<lb />he had to communicate to paper, since their mutual
<lb />agitation made him unable to explain himself with
<lb />clearness, and rather hurt his cause then assisted it,
<lb />by leaving all his arguments unfinished and obscure.</p>
<p><lb />Another dispute now arose; <persName>Cecilia</persName> protesting she
<pb n="593" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2B4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">200</mw>
<lb />would receive no letter, and hear nothing upon the
	    <lb />subject; and <persName>Delvile</persName> impetuously declaring he would
<lb />submit to no award without being first heard.  At
<lb />length he conquered, and at length he departed.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> felt her whole heart sink within her at the
<lb />unhappiness of her situation.  She considered herself
	    <lb />now condemned to refuse <persName>Delvile</persName> herself, as the only
<lb />condition upon which he even solicited her favour,
<lb />neither the strictness of her principles, nor the delicacy
<lb />of her mind, would suffer her to accept.  Her displea&shy;
<lb />sure at the proposal had been wholly unaffected, and
<lb />she regarded it as an injury to her character ever to
	    <lb />have received it; yet that <persName>Delvile's</persName> pride of heart
<lb />should give way to his passion, that he should love
<lb />her with so much fondness as to relinquish for her the
<lb />ambitious schemes of his family, and even that darling
<lb />name which so lately seemed annexed to his existence,
<lb />were circumstances to which she was not insensible,
<lb />and proofs of tenderness and regard which she had
<lb />thought incompatible with the general spirit of his
<lb />disposition.  Yet however by these she was gratified,
<lb />resolved never to comply with so humiliating a mea&shy;
<lb />sure, but to wait the consent of his friends, or renounce
<lb />him for ever.</p></div>

	    <lb />As soon as <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> was acquainted with the

<pb n="594" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">201</mw>
<lb />impatient to be informed what had passed.  The
<lb />narration she heard both hurt and astonished her;
<lb />that <persName>Cecilia</persName>, the heiress of such a fortune, the posses&shy;
<lb />sor of so much beauty, descended of a worthy family,
<lb />and formed and educated to grace a noble one, should
<lb />be rejected by people to whom her wealth would be
<lb />most useful, and only in secret have their alliance pro&shy;
<lb />psed to her, she deemed an indignity that called for
<lb />nothing but resentment, and approved and enforced the
<lb />resolution of her young friend to resist all solicitations
<lb />which Mr. and <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> did not second them&shy;
<lb />selves.</p>
<p>	    <lb />About two hours after <persName>Delvile</persName> was gone, his letter
<lb />arrived.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> opened it with trepidation, and read
<lb />as follows:</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-12"><body>
<div type="letter">

		  <salute rend="align(center)case(smallcaps)">To <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>.</salute>

<p>
<lb />What could be the apprehensions, the suspicions of
<lb /><persName>Miss Beverley</persName> when so earnestly she prohibited my
<lb />writing?  From a temper so unguarded as mine, could
<lb />she fear any subtlety of doctrine?  Is my character so
<lb />little known to her, that she can think me capable of
<lb />craft or duplicity?  Had I even the desire, I have
<lb />neither the address nor the patience to practise them;
<lb />no, loveliest <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, though sometimes by vehe&shy;
<lb />mence I may incautiously offend, by sophistry, believe
<lb />me, I never shall injure:  my ambition, as I have told
<lb />you, is to convince, not beguile, and my arguments
<lb />shall be simple as my professions shall be sincere.</p>
<p><lb />Yet how again may I venture to mention a proposal
<lb />which so lately, almost before you had heard, you
<lb />rejected?  Suffer me, however, to assure you it re&shy;
<mw type="vol" rend="align(left)">25.</mw>
<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">2C</mw>
<pb n="595" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C1v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">202</mw>
<lb />sulted neither from insensibility to your delicacy, nor
<lb />to my own duty; I made it, on the contrary, with
<lb />that reluctance and timidity which were given me by
<lb />an apprehension that both seemed to be offended by
<lb />it:&mdash;but alas! already I have said what with grief I
<lb />must repeat, I have no resource, no alternative, be&shy;
<lb />tween receiving the honour of your hand in secret, or
<lb />foregoing you for ever.</p>
<p><lb />You will wonder, you may well wonder at such a
<lb />declaration; and again that severe renunciation with
<lb />which you wounded me, will tremble on your lips&mdash;
<lb />Oh, there let it stop! nor let the air again be agitated
<lb />with sounds so discordant!</p>
<p><lb />In that cruel and heart-breaking moment when I tore
		    <lb />myself from you at <placeName>Delvile-Castle</placeName>, I confessed to you
<lb />the reason of my flight, and I determined to see you no
<lb />more.  I named not to you, then my family, the poten&shy;
<lb />cy of my own objections against daring to solicit your
<lb />favour, rendering theirs immaterial:  my own are now
<lb />wholly removed,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;but theirs remain in full
<lb />force.</p>
<p><lb />My father, descended of a race which though decay&shy;
<lb />ing in wealth, is unsubdued in pride, considers himself
<lb />as the guardian of the honour of his house, to which
<lb />he holds the name of his ancestors inseparably annexed:
<lb />my mother, born of the same family, and bred to the
<lb />same ideas, has strengthened this opinion by giving it
<lb />the sanction of her own.</p>
<p><lb />Such being their sentiments, you will not madam,
<lb />be surprised that their only son, the sole inheritor of
<lb />their fortune, and sole object of their expectations,
<lb />should early have admitted the same.  Indeed al&shy;
<lb />most the first lesson I was taught was that of re&shy;
<pb n="596" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">203</mw>
<lb />verencing the family from which I am descended, and
<lb />the name to which I was born.  I was bid consider my&shy;
<lb />self as its only remaining support, and sedulously in&shy;
<lb />structed neither to act nor think but with a view to its
<lb />aggrandizement and dignity.</p>
<p><lb />Thus, unchecked by ourselves, and uncontroled by
<lb />the world, this haughty self-importance acquired by
<lb />time a strength, and by mutual encouragement a firm&shy;
<lb />ness, which <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> alone could possibly, I
<lb />believe have shaken!  What, therefore, was my secret
<lb />alarm, when first I was conscious of the force of her
<lb />attractions, and found my mind wholly occupied with
<lb />admiration of her excellencies; All that pride could de&shy;
<lb />mand, and all to which ambition could aspire, all that
<lb />happiness could covet, or the most scrupulous delicacy
<lb />exact, in her I found united; and while my heart was
<lb />enslaved by her charms, my understanding exulted in
<lb />its fetters.&mdash;&mdash;Yet to forfeit my name, to give up for
<lb />ever a family which upon me rested its latest expectati&shy;
<lb />ons,&mdash;&mdash;Honour I thought, forbad it, propriety and
<lb />manly spirit revolted at the sacrifice.  The renunciati&shy;
<lb />on of my birth-right seemed a desertion of the post in
<lb />which I was stationed; I forebore, therefore, even in
<lb />my wishes, to solicit your favour, and vigorously de&shy;
<lb />termined to fly you as dangerous to my peace, because
<lb />unattainable without dishonour.</p>
<p><lb />Such was the intended regulation of my conduct at
		    <lb />the time I recieved <persName>Biddulph's</persName> letter; in three days I was
		    <lb />to leave <placeName>England</placeName>; my father, with much persuasion,
<lb />had consented to my departure; my mother, who pe&shy;
<lb />netrated into my motives, had never opposed it; but
<lb />how great was the change wrought upon my mind by
<lb />reading that letter; my steadiness forsook me, my re&shy;
<pb n="597" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">204</mw>
<lb />solution wavered; yet I thought him deceived, and
		    <lb />attributed his suspicions to jealousy:  but still, <persName>Fidel</persName>
<lb />I knew was missing&mdash;and to hear he was your darling
		    <lb />companion&mdash;&mdash;was it possible to quit <placeName>England</placeName> in a
<lb />state of such uncertainty? to be harassed in distant
<lb />climates with conjectures I might then never satisfy?
		    <lb />No; I told my friends I must visit <persName>Biddulph</persName> before
<lb />I left the kingdom, and promising to return to them in
		    <lb />three or four days, I hastily set out for <placeName>Suffolk</placeName>, and
		    <lb />rested not till I arrived at <persName>Mrs. Charlton's</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />What a scene there awaited me! to behold the loved
<lb />mistress of my heart, the opposed, yet resistless object
<lb />of my fondest admiration, caressing an animal she
<lb />knew to be mine, mourning over him his master's ill
<lb />health, and sweetly recommending to him fidelity.&mdash;&mdash;
<lb />Ah! forgive the retrospection, I will dwell on it no
<lb />longer.  Little, indeed, had I imagined with what soft&shy;
<lb />ness the dignity of <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> was blended, though
<lb />always conscious that her virtues, her attractions, and
<lb />her excellencies, would reflect lustre upon the highest
<lb />station to which human grandeur could raise her, and
<lb />would still be more exalted than her rank, though that
<lb />were the most eminent upon earth.&mdash;And had there
<lb />been a thousand, and ten thousand obstacles to oppose
<lb />my addressing her, vigorously and undauntedly would
<lb />I have combated with them all, in preference to yield&shy;
<lb />ing to this single objection.</p>
<p><lb />Let not the frankness of this declaration irritate you,
<lb />but rather let it serve to convince you of the sincerity
<lb />of what follows:  various as are the calamities of life
<lb />which may render me miserable, <emph rend="slant(upright)">YOU</emph> only, among
<lb />even its chosen felicities, have power to make me
<lb />happy.  Fame, honours, wealth, ambition, were insuf&shy;
<pb n="598" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">205</mw>
<lb />ficient without you; all chance of internal peace, and
<lb />every softer hope is now centered in your favour,
<lb />and to lose you, from whatever cause, ensures me
<lb />wretchedness unmitigated.</p>
<p><lb />With respect therefore to myself, the die is finally
<lb />cast, and the conflict between bosom felicity and fa&shy;
<lb />mily pride is deliberately over.  This name, which so
<lb />vainly I have cherished and so painfully supported, I
<lb />now find inadequate to recompense me for the sacrifice
<lb />which its preservation requires.  I part with it, I own
<lb />with regret, that the surrender is necessary; yet it is
<lb />rather an imaginary, than an actual evil, and though a
<lb />deep wound to pride, no offence to morality.</p>
<p><lb />Thus have I laid open to you my whole heart, con&shy;
<lb />fessed my perplexities, acknowledged my vain-glory,
<lb />and exposed with equal sincerity the sources of my
<lb />doubts, and the motives of my decision:  but now, in&shy;
<lb />deed, how to proceed, I know not; the difficulties
<lb />which are yet to encounter I fear to enumerate, and
<lb />the petition I have to urge I have scarce courage to
<lb />mention.</p>
<p><lb />My family, mistaking ambition for honour, and rank
<lb />for dignity, have long planned a splendid connection
<lb />for me, to which, though my invariable repugnance
<lb />has stopt any advances, their wishes and their views
<lb />immoveably adhere.  I am but too certain they will
<lb />now listen to no other.  I dread, therefore, to make a
<lb />trial where I despair of success; I know not how to
<lb />risk a prayer with those who may silence me by a
<lb />command.</p>
<p><lb />In a situation so desperate, what then remains?
<lb />Must I make an application with a certainty of rejec&shy;
<lb />tion, and then mock all authority, by acting in defi&shy;
<pb n="599" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">206</mw>
<lb />ance of it?  Or, harder task yet! relinquish my dear&shy;
<lb />est hopes when no longer persuaded of their impropri&shy;
<lb />ety?  Ah! sweetest <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, end the struggle at
<lb />once!  My happiness, my peace, are wholly in your
<lb />power, for the moment of our union secures them for
<lb />life.</p>
<p><lb />It may seem to you strange that I should thus pro&shy;
<lb />pose to brave the friends whom I venture not to entreat;
<lb />but from my knowledge of their characters and senti&shy;
<lb />ments, I am certain I have no other resource.  Their
<lb />favourite principles were too early imbibed to be now
<lb />at this late season eradicated.  Slaves that we all are
<lb />to habits, and dupes to appearances, jealous guardians
<lb />of our pride, to which our comfort is sacrificed, and
<lb />even our virtue made subservient, what conviction can
<lb />be offered by reason, to notions that exist but by pre&shy;
<lb />judice?  They have been cherished too long for rhe&shy;
<lb />toric to remove them, they can only be expelled by all&shy;
<lb />pwerful necessity.  Life is, indeed, too brief, and
<lb />success too precarious, to trust, in any case where hap&shy;
<lb />piness is concerned, the extirpation of deep-rooted and
<lb />darling opinions, to the slow-working influence of ar&shy;
<lb />gument and disquisition.</p>
<p><lb />Yet bigotted as they are to rank and family, they
<lb />adore <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, and though their consent to
<lb />the forfeiture of their name might for ever be denied,
<lb />when once they beheld her the head and ornament of
<lb />their house, her elegance and accomplishments joined
<lb />to the splendour of her fortune, would speedily make
<lb />them forget the plans which now wholly absorb them.
<lb />Their sense of honour is in nothing inferior to their
<lb />sense of high birth; your condescension, therefore,
<lb />would be felt by them in its fullest force, and though,

<lb />during their first surprise, they might <sic corr="b">h</sic>e irritated
<lb />against their son, they would make it the study of
<lb />their lives, that the lady who for him had done so
<lb />much, should never, through their means, repine for
<lb />herself.</p>
<p><lb />With regard to settlements, the privacy of our union
<lb />would not affect them:  one confidant we must una&shy;
<lb />voidably trust, and I would deposit in the hands of
<lb />whatever person you would name, a bond, by which I
<lb />would engage myself to settle both your fortune and
<lb />my own, according to the arbitration of our mutual
<lb />friends.</p>
<p><lb />The time for secrecy, though painful, owuld be
<lb />short, and even from the altar, if you desired it, I
		    <lb />would hasten to <placeName>Delvile-Castle</placeName>.  Not one of my
<lb />friends should you see till they waited upon you them&shy;

<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> read and re-read this letter, but with a per&shy;
<lb />turbation of mind that made her little able to weigh
<pb n="601" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2C4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">208</mw>
<lb />its contents.  Paragraph by paragraph her sentiments
<lb />varied, and her determination was changed:  the ear&shy;
<lb />nestness of his supplication now softened her into
<lb />compliance, the acknowledged pride of his family
<lb />now irritated her into resentment, and the confession
<lb />of his own regret now sickened her into despondence.
<lb />She meant in an immediate answer to have written a
<lb />final dismission; but though proof against his en&shy;
<lb />treaties, because not convinced by his arguments, there
<lb />was something in the conclusion of his letter that stag&shy;
<lb />gered her resolution.</p>
<p><lb />Those scruples and that refinement against which
<lb />he warned her, she herself thought might be over&shy;
<lb />strained, and to gratify unnecessary punctilio, the
<lb />short period of existence be rendered causelessly un&shy;
<lb />happy.  He had truly said that their union would
<lb />be no offence to morality; and with respect merely to
<lb />pride, why should that be spared?  He knew he possess&shy;
<lb />ed her heart, she had long been certain of his, her
<lb />character had early gained the affection of his mo&shy;
<lb />ther, and the essential service which an income such as
<lb />her's must do the family, would soon be felt too
<lb />powerfully to make her connection with it regretted.</p>
<p><lb />These reflections were so pleasant she knew not how
<lb />to discard them; and the consciousness that her secret
	    <lb />was betrayed not only to himself, but <persName>Mr. Biddulph</persName>,
	    <lb /><persName>Lord Ernolf</persName>, <persName>Lady Honoria Pemberton</persName>, and <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Delvile</persName>, gave them additional force, by making
<lb />it probable she was yet more widely suspected.</p>
<p><lb />But still her delicacy and her principles revolted
<lb />against a conduct of which the secrecy seemed to im&shy;
<lb />ply the impropriety.  <q id="CE392">How shall I meet <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName>,<sic corr="&amp;rdquo;"></sic></q>
<lb />cried she, <q id="CE393">after an action so clandestine?  How, after

<lb />praise such as she has bestowed upon me, bear the se&shy;
<lb />verity of her eye, when she thinks I have seduced from
<lb />her the obedience of her son!  A son who is the sole so&shy;
<lb />lace and first hope of her existence, whose virtues
<lb />make all her happiness, and whose filial piety is her
<lb />only glory!&mdash;And well may she glory in a son such as
	      <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>!  Nobly has he exerted himself in situations the
<lb />most difficult, his family and his ideas of honour he
<lb />has preferred to his peace and health, he has fulfilled
<lb />with spirit and integrity the various, the conflicting
<lb />duties of life.  Even now, perhaps, in his present ap&shy;
<lb />plication, he may merely think himself bound by
<lb />knowing me no longer free, and his generous sensibili&shy;
<lb />ty to the weakness he has discovered, without any of
<lb />the conviction to which he pretends, may have occasi&shy;
<lb />oned this proposal!</q></p>
<p><lb />In this fluctuating state of mind she found writing
<lb />impracticable; while uncertain what to wish, to decide
<lb />was impossible.  She disdained coquetry, she was su&shy;
	    <lb />perior to trifling, the candour and openness of <persName>Delvile</persName>
<lb />had merited all her sincerity, and therefore while any
<lb />doubt remained with herself, she held it unworthy her
<lb />character to tell him she had none.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, upon reading the letter, became the
	    <lb />advocate of <persName>Delvile</persName>; the frankness with which he had
<lb />stated his difficulties, assured her of his probity, and by
<lb />explaining his former conduct, satisfied her with the
<lb />rectitude of his future intentions.  <q id="CH1">Do not, therefore
<lb />my dear child,</q> cried she, <q id="CH2">become the parent of your
<lb />own misery, by refusing him; he deserves you alike from
<lb />his principles and his affection, and the task would
<lb />both be long and melancholy to disengage him from
<lb />your heart.  I see not, however, the least occasion for

<lb />the disgrace of a private marriage; I know not any fa&shy;
<lb />mily to which you would not be an honour, and those

<p><lb />The wishes of <persName>Cecilia</persName> accorded with this advice,

<lb />little reason to expect he would follow it.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />The day past away, and <persName>Cecilia</persName> had yet written
<lb />no answer, the evening came, and her resolution was
	    <lb />still unfixed.  <persName>Delvile</persName>, at length, was again announced;
<lb />and though she dreaded trusting herself to his entrea&shy;
<lb />ties, the necessity of hastening some decision deterred
<lb />her from refusing to see him.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> was with her when he entered the
<lb />room; he attempted at first some general conversation,
<lb />though the anxiety of his mind was strongly pictured
<lb />upon his face.  <persName>Cecilia</persName> endeavoured also to talk upon
<lb />common topics, though her evident embarrassment
<lb />spoke the absence of her thoughts.</p>
<pb n="604" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">211</mw>
<p>
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> at length, unable any longer to bear suspense
	    <lb />turned to <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, and said, <q>You are probably
<lb />acquainted, madam, with the purport of the letter I
<lb />had the honour of sending to <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> this morn&shy;
<lb />ing?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, Sir,</q> answered the old lady, <q>and you need
<lb />desire little more than that her opinion of it may be as
<lb />favourable as mine.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> bowed and thanked her; and looking at <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>, to whom he ventured not to speak, he perceived
<lb />in her countenance a mixture of dejection and confu&shy;
<lb />sion, that told him, whatever might be her opinoin, it
<lb />had by no means increased her happiness.</p>
<p><lb /><q>But why, Sir,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, <q>should you
<lb />be thus sure of the disapprobation of your friends?
<lb />had you not better hear what they have to say?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I know, madam, what they have to say,</q> returned
<lb />he:  <q>for their language and their principles have been
<lb />invariable from my birth; to apply to them, therefore
<lb />for a concession which I am certain they will not
<lb />grant, were only a cruel device to lay all my misery to
<lb />their account.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And if they are so perverse, they deserve from you
<lb />nothing better,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>; <q>speak to them,
<lb />however; you will then have done your duty; and if
<lb />they are obstinately unjust, you will have acquired a
<lb />right to act for yourself.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To mock their authority,</q> answered Delvile,
<lb /><q>would be more offensive than to oppose it:  to solicit
<lb />their approbation, and then act in defiance of it, might
<lb />justly provoke their indignation.&mdash;No; if at last I am
<lb />reduced to appeal to them, by their decision I must
<lb />abide.</q>
<pb n="605" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">212</mw></p>
<p><lb />To this <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> could make no answer, and
<lb />in a few minutes she left the room.</p>
<p><lb /><q>And is such, also,</q> said Delvile, <q>the opinion of
<lb /><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>? has she doomed me to be wretched,
<lb />and does she wish that doom to be signed by my
<lb />nearest friends!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>If your friends, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>are so un&shy;
<lb />doubtedly inflexible, it were madness, upon any plan,
<lb />to risk their displeasure.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To entreaty,</q> he answered, <q>they will be in&shy;
<lb />flexible, but not to forgiveness.  My father, though
<lb />haughty, dearly, even passionately loves me; my
<lb />mother, though high-spirited, is just, noble and ge&shy;
<lb />nerous.  She is, indeed, the most exalted of women,
<lb />and her power over my mind I am unaccustomed to
<lb />resist.  <persName>Miss Beverley</persName> alone seems born to be her
<lb />daughter&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, no,</q> interrupted <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>as her daughter
<lb />she rejects me!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>She loves, she adores you!</q> cried he, warmly;
<lb /><q>and were I not certain she feels your excellencies as
<lb />they ought to be felt, my veneration for you <emph>both</emph>
<lb />should even yet spare you my present supplication.
<lb />But you would become, I am certain, the first bles&shy;
<lb />sing of her life; in you she would behold all the
<lb />felicity of her son,&mdash;his restoration to health, to his
<lb />country, to his friends!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O Sir,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with emotion, <q>how deep
<lb />a trench of real misery do you sink, in order to raise
<lb />this pile of fancied happiness!  But I will not be re&shy;
<lb />sponsible for your offending such a mother; scarcely
<lb />can you honour her yourself more than I do; but
<lb />where can I,</q> continued she, <q>find a friend, who, in
<pb n="606" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">213</mw>
<lb />this critical moment, will instruct me how to
<lb />act.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You will find one,</q> answered he, <q>in your own
<lb />bosom; ask but yourself this plain question; will any
<lb />virtue be offended by your honouring me with your
<lb />hand.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes; duty will be offended, since it is contrary to
<lb />the will of your parents.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>But is there no time for emancipation?  Am not I
<lb />of an age to choose for myself the partner of my life?
<lb />Will not you in a few days be the uncontrolled mistress
<lb />of your actions?  Are we not both independent?
<lb />Your ample fortune all your own, and the estates of
<lb />my father so entailed, they must unavoidably be
<lb />mine?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And are these,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>considerations to
<lb />set us free from our duty?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, but they are circumstances to relieve us from
<lb />slavery.  Let me not offend you if I am still more ex&shy;
<lb />plicit.  When no law, human or divine, can be in&shy;
<lb />jured by our union, when one motive of pride is all
<lb />that can be opposed to a thousand motives of con&shy;
<lb />venience and happiness, why should we <emph>both</emph> be made
<lb />unhappy, merely lest that pride lose its gra&shy;
<lb />tification?</q></p>
<p><lb />This question, which so often and so angrily she had
<lb />revolved in her own mind, again silenced her; and
<lb />Delvile, with the eagerness of approaching success,
<lb />redoubled his solicitations.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Be mine,</q> he cried, <q>sweetest <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and all
<lb />will go well.  To refer me to my friends is, effec&shy;
<lb />tually, to banish me for ever.  Spare me, then, the
<lb />unavailing task; and save me from the resistless en&shy;
<pb n="607" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">214</mw>
<lb />treaties of a mother, whose every desire I have held
<lb />sacred, whose wish has been my law, and whose com&shy;
<lb />mands I have implicitly, invariably obeyed!  Oh, ge&shy;
<lb />nerously save me from the dreadful alternative of
<lb />wounding her maternal heart by a peremptory refusal,
<lb />or of torturing my own with pangs to which it is un&shy;
<lb />equal by an extorted obedience!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Alas!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>how utterly impossible I
<lb />can relieve you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And why? once mine, irrevocably mine&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, that would but irritate,&mdash;and irritate
<lb />past hope of pardon.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed you are mistaken:  to your merit they are
<lb />far from insensible, and your fortune is just what they
<lb />wish.  Trust me, therefore, when I assure you that
<lb />their displeasure, which both respect and justice will
<lb />guard them from ever shewing <emph>you</emph>, will soon die
<lb />wholly away.  I speak not merely from my hopes;
<lb />in judging my own friends, I consider human nature
<lb />in general.  Inevitable evils are ever best supported.
<lb />It is suspense, it is hope that make the food of misery:
<lb />certainty is always endured, because known to be
<lb />past amendment, and felt to give defiance to
<lb />struggling.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And can you,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>with reasoning so
<lb />desperate be satisfied?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>In a situation so extraordinary as ours,</q> answered
<lb />he, <q>there is no other.  The voice of the world at
<lb />large will be all in our favour.  Our union neither
<lb />injures our fortunes, nor taints our morality:  with the
<lb />character of each the other is satisfied, and both must
<lb />be alike exculpated from mercenary views of interest,
<lb />or romantic contempt of poverty; what right have
<pb n="608" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">215</mw>
<lb />we, then, to repine at an objection which, however
<lb />potent, is single?  Surely none.  Oh if wholly un&shy;
<lb />checked were the happiness I now have in view, if no
<lb />foul storm sometimes lowered over the prospect, and
<lb />for a moment obscured its brightness, how could my
<lb />heart find room for joy so superlative?  The whole
<lb />world might rise against me, as the first man in it who
<lb />had nothing left to wish!</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose own hopes aided this reasoning,
<lb />found not much to oppose it; and with little more
<lb />of entreaty, and still less of argument, Delvile at length
<lb />obtained her consent to his plan. Fearfully, indeed,
<lb />and with unfeigned reluctance she gave it, but it was
<lb />the only alternative with a separation for ever, to
<lb />which she held not the necessity adequate to the
<lb />pain.</p>
<p>	    <lb />The thanks of <persName>Delvile</persName> were as vehement as had been
<lb />his entreaties, which yet, however, were not at an end;
<lb />the concession she had made was imperfect, unless its
<lb />performance were immediate, and he now endeavour&shy;
<lb />ed to prevail with her to be his before the expiration
<lb />of a week.</p>
<p><lb />Here, however, his task ceased to be difficult;
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, as ingenuous by nature as she was honourable
<lb />from principle, having once brought her mind to con&shy;
<lb />sent to his proposal, sought not by studied difficulties
<lb />to enhance the value of her compliance:  the great
<lb />point resolved upon, she held all else of too little im&shy;
<lb />portance for a contest.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> was now called in, and acquainted
<lb />with the result of their conference.  Her approbation
<lb />by no means followed the scheme of privacy; yet she
<lb />was too much rejoiced in seeing her young friend near
<pb n="609" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2D4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">216</mw>
<lb />the period of her long suspense and uneasiness, to
<lb />oppose any plan which might forward their ter&shy;
<lb />mination.</p>
<p><lb />Delvile then again begged to know what male con&shy;
<lb />fidant might be entrusted with their project.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> immediately occurred to <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
<lb />though the certainty of his ill-will to the cause made
<lb />all application to him disagreeable:  but his long and
<lb />steady friendship for her, his readiness to counsel and
<lb />assist her, and the promises she had occasionally made,
<lb />not to act without his advice, all concurred to per&shy;
<lb />suade her that in a matter of such importance, she
<lb />owed to him her confidence, and should be culpable
<lb />to proceed without it.  Upon him, therefore, she
<lb />fixed; yet finding in herself a repugnance insuperable
<lb />to acquainting him with her situation, she agreed that
<lb />Delvile, who instantly proposed to be her messenger,
<lb />should open to him the affair, and prepare him for
<lb />their meeting.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, then, rapid in thought and fertile in expe&shy;
<lb />dients, with a celerity and vigour which bore down
<lb />all objections, arranged the whole conduct of the
<lb />business.  To avoid suspicion, he determined instantly
<lb />to quit her, and, as soon as he had executed his com&shy;
<lb />mission with <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, to hasten to <placeName>London</placeName>, that
<lb />the necessary preparations for their marriage might be
<lb />made with dispatch and secrecy.  He purposed, also,
<lb />to find out <persName>Mr. Belfield</persName>, that he might draw up the
<lb />bond with which he meant to entrust <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.
<lb />This measure <persName>Cecilia</persName> would have opposed, but he re&shy;
<lb />fused to listen to her.  <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> herself, though
<lb />her age and infirmities had long confined her to her
<lb />own house, gratified <persName>Cecilia</persName> upon this critical occa&shy;
<pb n="610" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">217</mw>
<lb />sion with consenting to accompany her to the altar.
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> was depended upon for giving her
<lb />away, and a church in <placeName>London</placeName> was the place ap&shy;
<lb />pointed for the performance of the ceremony.  In
<lb />three days the principal difficulties to the union would
<lb />be removed by <persName>Cecilia</persName>'s coming of age, and in five
<lb />days it was agreed they should actually meet in town.
<lb />The moment they were married, Delvile promised to
<lb />set off for the Castle, while in another chaise, <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />returned to <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>'s.</p>
<p><lb />This settled, he conjured her to be punctual, and
<lb />earnestly recommending himself to her fidelity and af&shy;
<lb />fection, he bid her adieu.</p>
<p><lb />The next morning during breakfast, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>
<lb />arrived.</p>
<p><lb />Not greater, though winged with joy, had been the
	    <lb />expedition of <persName>Delvile</persName> to open to him his plan, than
<lb />was his own, though only goaded by desperation to
<lb />make some effort with <persName>Cecilia</persName> for rendering it abor&shy;
<lb />tive.  Nor could all his self-denial, the command
<lb />which he held over his passions, nor the rigour with
<lb />which his feelings were made subservient to his in&shy;
<lb />terest, in this sudden hour of trial, avail to preserve
<lb />his equanimity.  The refinements of hypocrisy, and
<lb />the arts of insinuation, offered the advantages too distant,
<lb />and exacted attentions too subtle, for a moment so
<lb />alarming; those arts and those attentions he had
<lb />already for many years practised, with an address the
<lb />most masterly, and a diligence the most indefatigable:
<lb />success had of late seemed to follow his toils, the en&shy;
<lb />creasing infirmities of his wife, the disappointment
<lb />and retirement of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, uniting to promise him a
<lb />conclusion equally speedy and happy; when now, by

<mw type="sig" rend="align(center)">2E</mw>
<pb n="611" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">218</mw>
<lb />a sudden and unexpected stroke, the sweet solace of
<lb />his future cares, the long projected recompense of his
<lb />past sufferings, was to be snatched from him for ever,
<lb />and by one who, compared with himself, was but the
<lb />acquaintance of a day.</p>
<p><lb />Almost wholly off his guard from the surprise and
<lb />horror of this apprehension, he entered the room
<lb />with such an air of haste and perturbation, that Mrs.
<lb />Charlton and her grand-daughters demanded what
<lb />was the matter.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I am come,</q> he answered abruptly, yet endea&shy;
<lb />vouring to recollect himself, <q>to speak with Miss
<lb />Beverley upon business of some importance.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>My dear, then,</q> said <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, <q>you had
<lb />better go with <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> into your dressing&shy;
<lb />room.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, deeply blushing, arose and led the way:
	    <lb />slowly, however, she proceeded, though urged by <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>, to make speed.  Certain of his disap&shy;
<lb />probation, and but doubtfully relieved from her own,
<lb />she dreaded a conference which on his side, she fore&shy;
<lb />saw, would be all exhortation and reproof, and on
<lb />hers all timidity and shame.</p>
<p><lb /><q>Good God,</q> cried he, <q><persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, what is
<lb />this you have done? bound yourself to marry a man
<lb />who despises, who scorns, who refuses to own you!</q></p>
<p><lb />Shocked by this opening, she started, but could
<lb />make no answer.</p>
<p><lb /><q>See you not,</q> he continued, <q>the indignity which
<lb />is offered you?  Does the loose, the flimsy veil with
<lb />which it is covered, hide it from your understanding,
<lb />or disguise it from your delicacy?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I thought not,&mdash;I meant not,</q> said she, more and
<pb n="612" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">219</mw>
<lb />more confounded, <q>to submit to any indignity,
<lb />though my pride, in an exigence so peculiar, may
<lb />give way, for a while, to convenience.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>To convenience?</q> repeated he, <q>to contempt, to
<lb />derision, to insolence!</q>&mdash;</p>
<p><lb /><q>O, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>!</q> interrupted <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>make not
<lb />use of such expressions! they are too cruel for me
<lb />to hear, and if I thought they were just, would make
<lb />me miserable for life.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>You are deceived, grossly deceived,</q> replied he,
<lb /><q>if you doubt their truth for a moment:  they are not,
<lb />indeed, even decently concealed from you; they are
<lb />glaring as the day, and wilful blindness can alone ob&shy;
<lb />scure them.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I am sorry, Sir,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose confusion, at a
<lb />charge so rough, began now to give way to anger, <q>if
<lb />this is your opinion; and I am sorry, too, for the li&shy;
<lb />berty I have taken in troubling you upon such a sub&shy;
<lb />ject.</q></p>
<p><lb />An apology so full of displeasure instantly taught
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> the error he was committing, and
<lb />checking, therefore, the violence of those emotions to
<lb />which his sudden and desperate disappointment gave
<lb />rise, and which betrayed him into reproaches so unskil&shy;
<lb />ful, he endeavoured to recover his accustomed equani&shy;
<lb />mity, and assuming an air of friendly openness, said,
<lb /><q>Let me not offend you, my dear <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, by a
<lb />freedom which results merely from a solicitude, to serve
<lb />you, and which the length and intimacy of our ac&shy;
<lb />quaintance had, I hoped, long since authorised.  I
<lb />know not how to see you on the brink of destruction
<lb />without speaking, yet, if you are averse to my sinceri&shy;
<lb />ty, I will curb it, and have done.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, do not have done,</q> cried she, much softened;
<pb n="613" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">220</mw>
<lb /><q>your sincerity does me nothing but honour, and hi&shy;
<lb />therto, I am sure, it has done me nothing but good.
<lb />Perhaps I deserve your utmost censure; I feared it in&shy;
<lb />deed, before you came, and ought, therefore, to have
<lb />better prepared myself for meeting with it.</q></p>
<p><lb />This speech completed <persName>Mr. Monckton's</persName> self-victory,
<lb />it shewed him not only the impropriety of his turbu&shy;
<lb />lence, but gave him room to hope that a mildness
<lb />more crafty would have better success.</p>
<p><lb /><q>You cannot but be certain,</q> he answered, <q>that
<lb />my zeal proceeds wholly from a desire to be of use to
<lb />you:  my knowledge of the world might possibly, I
<lb />thought, assist your inexperience, and the disinterested&shy;
<lb />ness of my regard, might enable me to see and to point
<lb />out the dangers to which you are exposed, from arti&shy;
<lb />fice and duplicity in those who have other purposes to
<lb />answer than what simply belong to your welfare.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Neither artifice nor duplicity,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>,
	    <lb />jealous for the honour of <persName>Delvile</persName>, <q>have been practised
<lb />against me.  Argument, and not persuasion, determined
<lb />me, and if I have done wrong&mdash;those who prompted
<lb />me have erred as unwittingly as myself.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Your are too generous to perceive the difference,
<lb />or you would find nothing less alike.  If however, my
<lb />plainness will not offend you, before it is quite too late,
<lb />I will point out to you a few of the evils,&mdash;for there
<lb />are some I cannot even mention, which at this instant
<lb />do not merely threaten but await you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> started at this terrifying offer, and afraid to
<lb />accept, yet ashamed to refuse it, hung back irresolute.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I see,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, after a pause of some
<lb />continuance, <q>your determination admits no appeal.
<lb />The consequence must, indeed, be all your own, but I
<lb />am greatly grieved to find how little you are aware of
<pb n="614" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">221</mw>
<lb />its seriousness.  Hereafter you will wish, perhaps, that
<lb />the friend of your earliest youth had been permitted to
<lb />advise you; at present you only think him officious
<lb />and impertinent, and therefore he can do nothing you
<lb />will be so likely to approve as quitting you.  I wish
<lb />you, then, greater happiness than seems prepared to
<lb />follow you, and a counsellor more prosperous in offer&shy;
<lb />ing his assistance.</q></p>
<p><lb />He would then have taken his leave; but <persName>Cecilia</persName>
<lb />called out, <q>Oh, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>! do you then give
<lb />me up?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Not unless you wish it.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Alas, I know not what to wish! except, indeed,
<lb />the restoration of that security from self-blame, which
<lb />till yesterday, even in the midst of disappointment,
<lb />quieted and consoled me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Are you, then, sensible you have gone wrong, yet
<lb />resolute not to turn back?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Could I tell, could I see,</q> cried she, with energy,
<lb /><q>which way I ought to turn, not a moment would I
<lb />hesitate how to act! my heart should have no power,
<lb />my happiness no choice,&mdash;I would recover my own
<lb />esteem by any sacrifice that could be made?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>What, then, can possibly be your doubt?  To be as
<lb />you were yesterday what is wanting but your own in&shy;
<lb />clination?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Every thing is wanting; right, honour, firmness,
<lb />all by which the just are bound, and all which the con&shy;
<lb />scientious hold sacred!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>These scruples are merely romantic; your own
<lb />good sense, had it fairer play, would contemn them;
<lb />but it is wrapped at present by prejudice and prepos&shy;
<lb />session.</q>
<pb n="615" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">222</mw>
<lb /><q>No, indeed!</q> cried she, colouring at the charge, <q>I
<lb />may have entered too precipitately into an engage&shy;
<lb />ment I ought to have avoided, but it is weakness of
<lb />judgment, not of heart, that disables me from retrieving
<lb />my error.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yet you will neither hear whither it may lead you,
<lb />nor which way you may escape from it?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Yes, Sir,</q> cried she, trembling, <q>I am now ready
<lb />to hear both.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Briefly, then, I will tell you.  It will lead you into
<lb />a family of which every individual will disdain you; it
<lb />will make you inmate of an house of which no other
<lb />inmate will associate with you; you will be insulted
<lb />asan inferior, and reproached as an intruder; your
<lb />birth will be a subject of ridicule, and your whole race
<lb />only named with derision:  and while the elders of the
<lb />proud castle treat you with open contempt, the man for
<lb />whom you suffer will not dare to support you.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Impossible! impossible!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with the
<lb />most angry emotion, <q>this whole representation is ex&shy;
<lb />aggerated, and the latter part is utterly without foun&shy;
<lb />dation.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>The latter part,</q> said <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, <q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">is of all
<lb />other least disputable; the man who now dares not own
<lb />will then never venture to defend you.  On the contra&shy;
<lb />ry, to make peace for himself, he will be the first to
<lb />neglect you.  The ruined estates of his ancestors will
<lb />be repaired by your fortune, while the name which
<lb />you carry into his family, will be constantly resented
<lb />as an injury; you will thus be plundered though you
<lb />are scorned, and told to consider yourself honoured that
<lb />they condescend to make use of you! nor here rests
<lb />the evil of a forced connection with so much ar&shy;
<pb n="616" />

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">223</mw>
<lb />rogance,&mdash;even your children, should you have any,
<lb />will be educated to despise you!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Dreadful and horrible!</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>; <q>I can
<lb />hear no more.&mdash;Oh, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, what a prospect
<lb />have you opened to my view!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Fly from it, then, while it is yet in your power,&mdash;
<lb />when two paths are before you, choose not that which
<lb />leads to destruction; send instantly after Delvile and
<lb />tell him that you have recovered your senses.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I would long since have sent,&mdash;I wanted not a
<lb />representation such as this,&mdash;but I know not how to
<lb />direct to him, nor whither he is gone.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>All art and baseness to prevent your recan&shy;
<lb />tation!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No, Sir, no,</q> cried she with quickness; <q>what&shy;
<lb />ever may be the truth of your painting in general, all
<lb />that concerns&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb />Ashamed of the vindication she intended, which
<lb />yet in her own mind was firm and animated, she stopt
<lb />and left the sentence unfinished.</p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>In what place were you to meet?</q> said <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>; <q>you can at least send to him there.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>We were only to have met,</q> answered she, in
<lb />much confusion, <q>at the last moment,&mdash;and that
<lb />would be to late&mdash;it would be too&mdash;I could not,
<lb />without some previous notice, break a promise which
<lb />I gave without any restriction.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Is this your only objection?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It is:  but it is one which I cannot conquer.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Then you would give up this ill-boding connec&shy;
<lb />tion, but from notions of delicacy with regard to the
<lb />time?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Indeed I meant it, before you came.</q></p>
<pb n="617" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2E4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">224</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>I, then, will obviate this objection:  give me but
<lb />the commission, either verbally or in writing, and I
<lb />will undertake to find him out, and deliver it
<lb />before night.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, little expecting this offer, turned extremely
<lb />pale, and after pausing some moments, said in a faul&shy;
<lb />tering voice, <q>What, then, Sir, is your advice, in what
<lb />manner&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I will say to him all that is necessary; trust the
<lb />matter with me.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No,&mdash;he deserves, at least, an apology from my&shy;
<lb />self&mdash;though how to make it&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb />She stopt, she hesitated, she went out of the room
<lb />for a pen and ink, she returned without them, and the
<lb />agitation of her mind every instant encreasing, she
<lb />begged him, in a faint voice, to excuse her while she
<lb />consulted with <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>, and promising to wait
<lb />upon him again, was hurrying away.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, however, saw too great danger in
<lb />so much emotion to trust her out of his sight:  he told
<lb />her, therefore, that she would only encrease her per&shy;
<lb />plexity, without reaping any advantage, by an ap&shy;
<lb />plication to <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>; that if she was really sin&shy;
<lb />cere in wishing to recede, there was not a moment to
<lb />be lost, and Delvile should immediately be pursued.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, sensible of the truth of this speech, and
<lb />once more recollecting the unaffected earnestness with
<lb />which, but an hour or two before, she had herself
<lb />desired to renounce this engagement, now summoned
<lb />her utmost courage to her aid, and, after a short, but
<lb />painful struggle, determined to act consistently with
<lb />her professions and her character, and, by one great
<lb />and final effort, to conclude all her doubts, and try to

<milestone unit="sig" n="2F1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">225</mw>
<lb />silence even her regret, by completing the triumph of
<lb />fortitude over inclination.</p>
<p><lb />She called, therefore, for pen and ink, and without
<lb />venturing herself from the room, wrote the following
<lb />letter.</p>
<q><text id="TR00090-13"><body>

<p>
<lb />Accuse me not of caprice, and pardon my irreso&shy;
<lb />lution, when you find me shrinking with terror from
<lb />the promise I have made, and no longer either able or
<lb />willing to perform it.  The reproaches of your family
<lb />I should ill endure; but the reproaches of my
<lb />own heart for an action I can neither approve nor
<lb />defend, would be still more oppressive.  With such a
<lb />weight upon the mind, length of life would be bur&shy;
<lb />thensome; with a sensation of guilt early death would
<lb />be terrific!  These being my notions of the engage&shy;
<lb />ment into which we have entered, you cannot wonder,
<lb />and you have still less reason to repine, that I dare
<lb />not fulfil it.  Alas! where would be your chance of
<lb />happiness with one who in the very act of becoming
<lb />yours would forfeit her own!</p>
<p><lb />I blush at this tardy recantation, and I grieve at the
<lb />disappointment it may occasion you:  but I have
<lb />yielded to the exhortations of an inward monitor,
<lb />who is never to be neglected with impunity.  Con&shy;
<lb />sult him yourself; and I shall need no other ad&shy;
<lb />vocate.</p>
<p><lb />Adieu, and may all felicity attend you!  If to hear
<lb />of the almost total privation of mine, will mitigate
<lb />the resentment with which you will probably read
<lb />this letter, it may be mitigated but too easily!  Yet

<lb />my consent to a clandestine action shall never be re&shy;

<lb />This letter, which with trembling haste, resulting
<lb />from a fear of her own steadiness, she folded and
<lb />sealed, <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, from the same apprehension,
<lb />yet more eagerly received, and scarce waiting to
<lb />bid her good morning, mounted his horse, and pursued
<lb />his way to <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> returned to <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> to acquaint her

<lb />found a satisfaction in the sacrifice she had made, that
<lb />recompensed her for much of her suffrage, and
<lb />soothed her into something like tranquillity; the true
<lb />power of virtue she had scarce experienced before,
<lb />for she found it a resource against the cruellest dejec&shy;
<lb />tion, and a surpporter in the bitterest disappointment.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />The day passed on without any intelligence; the
<lb />next day, also, passed in the same manner, and
<pb n="620" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">227</mw>
<lb />on the third, which was her birth-day, <persName>Cecilia</persName> be
<lb />came of age.</p>
<p><lb />The preparations which had long been making
<lb />among her tenants to celebrate this event, <persName>Cecilia</persName> ap&shy;
<lb />peared to take some share, and endeavoured to find
<lb />some pleasure in.  She gave a public dinner to all
<lb />who were willing to partake of it, she promised re&shy;
<lb />dress to those who complained of hard usage, she
<lb />pardoned many debts, and distributed money, food,
<lb />and cloathing to the poor.  These benevolent occu&shy;
<lb />pations made time seem less heavy, and while they
<lb />freed her from solitude, diverted her suspence.  She
<lb />still, however, continued at the house of Mrs.
<lb />Charton, the workmen having disappointed her in
<lb />finishing her own.</p>
<p><lb />But, in defiance of her utmost exertion, towards
<lb />the evening of this day the uneasiness of her uncer&shy;
<lb />tainty grew almost intolerable.  The next morning
	    <lb />she had promised <persName>Delvile</persName> to set out for <placeName>London</placeName>, and
<lb />he expected the morning after to claim her for his
<lb />wife; yet <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> neither sent nor came, and
<lb />she knew not if her letter was delivered, or if still he
<lb />was unprepared for the disappointment by which he
<lb />was awaited.  A secret regret for the unhappiness
<lb />she must occasion him, which silently yet power&shy;
<lb />fully reproached her, stole fast upon her mind, and
<lb />invariable in holding his proposal to be wrong, she
<lb />thought too highly of his character to believe he
<lb />would have made it but from a mistaken notion it was
<lb />right.  She painted him, therefore, to herself, as glow&shy;
<lb />ing with indignation, accusing her of inconsistency,
<lb />and perhaps suspecting her of coquetry, and imputing
<pb n="621" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">228</mw>
<lb />her change of conduct to motives the most trifling
<lb />and narrow, till with resentment and disdain, he drove
<lb />her wholly from his thoughts.</p>
<p><lb />In a few minutes, however, the picture was re&shy;
	    <lb />versed; <persName>Delvile</persName> no more appeared storming nor un&shy;
<lb />reasonable; his face wore an aspect of sorrow, and
<lb />his brow was clouded with disappointment:  he for&shy;
<lb />bore to reproach her, but the look which her imagi&shy;
<lb />nation delineated was more piercing than words of
<lb />severest import.</p>
<p><lb />These images pursued and tormented her, drew tears
<lb />from her eyes, and loaded her heart with anguish.
<lb />Yet, when she recollected that her conduct had had in
	    <lb />view a higher motive than pleasing <persName>Delvile</persName>, she felt
<lb />that it ought to offer her a higher satisfaction:  she
<lb />tried, therefore, to revive her spirits, by reflecting
<lb />upon her integrity, and refused all indulgence to this
<lb />enervating sadness, beyond what the weakness of
<lb />human nature demands, as some relief to its suffer&shy;
<lb />ings upon every fresh attack of misery.</p>
<p><lb />A conduct such as this, was the best antidote against
<lb />affliction, whose arrows are never with so little diffi&shy;
<lb />culty repelled, as when they light upon a conscience
<lb />which no self-reproach has laid bare to their malig&shy;
<lb />nancy.</p>
<p><lb />Before six o'clock the next morning, her maid came
<lb />to her bedside with the followning letter, which she
<lb />told her had been brought by an express.</p>

		    <lb />May this letter, with one only from <placeName>Delvile-

<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">229</mw>
<p>
<lb />Yet sweet to me as is that hope, I write in the ut&shy;
<lb />most uneasiness; I have just heard that a gentleman,
<lb />whom, by the description that is given of him, I
<lb />imagine is <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, has been in search of me
<lb />with a letter which he was anxious to deliver im&shy;
<lb />mediately.</p>
<p><lb />Perhaps this letter is from <persName>Miss Beverley</persName>, perhaps
<lb />it contains directions which ought instantly to be fol&shy;
<lb />lowed:  could I divine what they are, with what
<lb />eagerness would I study to anticipate their execution!
<lb />It will not, I hope, be too late to receive them on
		    <lb /><name>Saturday</name> when her power over my actions will be
<lb />confirmed, and when every wish she will communicate,
<lb />shall be gratefully, joyfully, and with delight ful&shy;
<lb />filled.</p>
<p>		    <lb />I have sought <persName>Belfield</persName> in vain; he has left <persName>Lord
<lb />Vannelt</persName>, and no one knows whither he is gone.  I
<lb />have been obliged, therefore, to trust a stranger to
<lb />draw up the bond; but he is a man of good character,
<lb />and the time of secrecy will be too short to put his
		    <lb />discretion in much danger.  To-morrow, <name>Friday</name>, I
		    <lb />shall spend solely in endeavouring to discover <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName>; I have leisure sufficient for the search,
<lb />since so prosperous has been by diligence, that <emph>every
<lb />thing is prepared!</emph></p>
<p>		    <lb />I have seen some lodgings in <placeName>Pall-Mall</placeName>, which I
<lb />think are commodious and will suit you:  send a
<lb />servant, therefore, before you to secure them.  If
<lb />upon your arrival I should venture to meet you there,
<lb />be not, I beseech you, offended or alarmed; I shall
<lb />take every possible precaution neither to be known
<lb />nor seen, and I will stay with you only three minutes.
<lb />The messenger who carries this is ingorant from whom

<milestone unit="sig" n="2F3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">230</mw>
<lb />it comes, for I fear his repeating my name among your
<lb />servants, and he could scarce return to me with an
<lb />answer before you will yourself be in town.  Yes,
<lb />loveliest <persName>Cecilia</persName>! at the very moment you receive
<lb />this letter, the chaise will, I flatter myself, be at the
<lb />door, which is to bring me a treasure that will enrich
<lb />every future hour of my life!  And oh, as to me it will
<lb />be exhaustless, may but its sweet dispenser experience
<lb />some share of the happiness she bestows, and then what,
<lb />save her own purity, will be so perfect, so unsullied, as
<lb />the felicity of her</p>

</body></text></q>
<p>
<lb />The perturbation of <persName>Cecilia</persName> upon reading this letter
<lb />was unspeakable:  <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, she found, had been
<lb />wholly unsuccessful, all her heroism had answered no
<lb />purpose, and the transaction was as backward as
<lb />before she had exerted it.</p>
<p><lb />She was now, therefore, called upon to think and act
<lb />entirely for herself.  Her opinion was still the same,
<lb />nor did her resolution waver, yet how to put it in exe&shy;
<lb />cution she could not discern.</p>
<p><lb />To write him was impossible, since she was ig&shy;
<lb />norant where he was to be found; to disappoint him
<lb />at the last moment she could not resolve, since such a
<lb />conduct appeared to her unfeeling and unjustifiable:
<lb />for a few instants she thought of having him waited
<lb />for at night in <placeName>London</placeName>, with a letter; but the danger
<lb />of entrusting any one with such a commission, and
<lb />the uncertainty of finding him, should he disguise him&shy;
<lb />self, made the success of this scheme too precarious for
<lb />trial.</p>
<p><lb />One expedient alone occurred to her, which, though
<pb n="624" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F4r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">231</mw>
<lb />she felt to be hazardous, she believed was without an
	    <lb />alternative:  this was no other than hastening to <placeName>Lon&shy;
<lb />don</placeName> herself, consenting to the interview he had pro&shy;
	    <lb />posed in <placeName>Pall Mall</placeName>, and then, by strongly stating her
<lb />objections, and confessing the grief they occasioned
<lb />her, to pique at once his generosity and his pride, upon
<lb />releasing her himself from the engagement into which
<lb />he had entered.</p>
<p><lb />A chaise, therefore, was ordered; and with post&shy;
<lb />horses for speed, and two servants on horseback, the
<lb />moment <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> was ready, they set out on their
<lb />journey.</p>
<p>	    <lb />It was near ten o'clock before they arrived at <placeName>Pall-
	      <lb />Mall</placeName>.  The house to which <persName>Delvile</persName> had given direc&shy;
<lb />tions was easily found, and the servant sent forward
<lb />had prepared the people of it for their reception.</p>
<p><lb />In the cruellest anxiety and trepidation, <persName>Cecilia</persName> then
	    <lb />counted every moment till <persName>Delvile</persName> came.</p>
<p><lb />The instant there was an knock at the door, she flew
<lb />out upon the stairs to listen; and hearing his well&shy;
<lb />known voice enquiring for the ladies who had just
<lb />taken the lodgings, she ran back to <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>,
<lb />saying, <q>Ah, madam, assist me I entreat! for now must
<lb />I merit, or forfeit your esteem for ever.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>Can you pardon,</q> cried <persName>Delvile</persName>, as he entered the
<lb />room, <q>an intrusion which was not <emph>in our bond?</emph>  But
<lb />how could I wait till to-morrow, when I knew you
<lb />were in town to-night?</q></p>
<p><lb />He then made his compliments to <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>
<lb />and, after enquiring how she had borne her journey,
<lb />turned again to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, whose uneasy sensations he
<lb />saw but too plainly in her countenance:  <q>Are you
<lb />angry,</q> cried he, anxiously, <q>that I have ventured to
<lb />come hither to night?</q></p>
<pb n="625" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2F4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">232</mw>
<p>
<lb /><q>No,</q> answered she, struggling with all her feelings
<lb />for composure; <q>what we wish is easily excused;
<lb />and I am glad to see you to-night, because otherwise
<lb />&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb />She hesitated; and Delvile, little imagining why,
<lb />thanked her in the warmest terms for her condescen&shy;
<lb />sion.  He then related how he had been tormented by
<lb /><persName>Morrice</persName>, enquired why <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> had not accom&shy;
<lb />panied her, and what could possibly have induced her
<lb />to make her journey so late, or, with so large a party,
<lb />to be walking upon the high road instead of hastening
<lb />to <placeName>London</placeName>.</p>
<p><lb /><q>I wonder not,</q> answered she, more steadily, <q>at
<lb />your surprise, though I have no time to lessen it.  You
<lb />have never, I find, received my letter?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>No,</q> cried he, much struck by her manner; <q>was
<lb />it to forbid our meeting till to-morrow?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That letter,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>would have explained
<lb />to you all.  I scarce know how to communicate its
<lb />contents; yet I hope you will hear with patience what
<lb />I acknowledge I have resolved upon only from neces&shy;
<lb />sity.  That letter was to tell you that to-morrow we
<lb />must not meet;&mdash;it was to prepare you, indeed, for
<lb />our meeting, perhaps, never more!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Gracious heaven!</q> exclaimed he, starting, <q>what
<lb />is it you mean?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>That I have made a promise too rash to be kept,
<lb />that you must pardon me if, late as it is, I retract,
<lb />since I am convinced it was wrong, and must be
<lb />wretched in performing it.</q></p>
<p><lb />Confounded and dismayed, for a moment he conti&shy;
<lb />nued silent, and then passionately called out, <q>Who
<lb />has been with you to defame me in your opinion?&mdash;&mdash;
<pb n="626" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G1r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">233</mw>
<lb />Who has barbarously wronged my character since I
	      <lb />left you last <name>Monday</name>?  <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName> received me
<lb />coldly, has he injured me in your esteem?  Tell, tell
<lb />me but to whom I owe this change, that my vindicati&shy;
<lb />on, if it restores not your favour, may at least make
<lb />you cease to blush that once I was honoured with some
<lb />share of it?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>It wants not to be restored,</q> said <persName>Cecilia</persName>, with
<lb />much softness, <q>since it has never been alienated.  Be
<lb />satisfied that I think of you as I thought when we last
<lb />parted, and generously forebear to reproach me, when
<lb />I assure you I am actuated by principles which you
<lb />ought not to disapprove.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And are you then unchanged?</q> cried he, more
<lb />gently, <q>and is your esteem for me still&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I thought it justice to say so once,</q> cried she, has&shy;
<lb />tily interrupting him, <q>but exact from me nothing
<lb />more.  It is too late for us now to talk any longer; to&shy;
	      <lb />morrow you may find my letter at <persName>Mr. Roberts's</persName>, and
<lb />that, short as it is, contains my resolution and its
<lb />cause.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Never,</q> cried he vehemently, <q>can I quit you
<lb />without knowing it!  I would not linger till to-morrow
<lb />in this suspense to be master of the universe!</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I have told it you, Sir, already; whatever is clan&shy;
<lb />destine carries a consciousness of evil, and so repug&shy;
<lb />nant do I find it to my disposition and opinions, that
<lb />till you give me back the promise I so unworthily
<lb />made I must be a stranger to peace, becuase at war
<lb />with my own actions and myself.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><q>You overwhelm me with grief,</q> cried <persName>Delvile</persName> <q>by
<lb />finding you thus distressed, when I hope&mdash;Oh, cruel
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>! how different to this did I hope to have met

<lb />you! all your doubts settled, all your fears removed,
<lb />your mind perfectly composed, and ready, unreluctant&shy;
<lb />ly, to ratify the promise with so much sweetness ac&shy;
<lb />corded me!&mdash;where now are those hopes!&mdash;where
<lb />now&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Why will you not be gone?</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName> uneasi&shy;
<lb />ly, <q>indeed it is to late to stay.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Tell me first,</q> cried he, with great energy, <q>ought
<lb />not every objection to our union, however potent, to
<lb />give way, without further hesitation, to the certainty
<lb />that our intending it must become public?  Who that
<lb />hears of our meeting in <placeName>London</placeName>, at such a season, in
<lb />such circumstances, and at such hours,&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>And why,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, angrily, <q>do you menti&shy;
<lb />on them, and yet stay?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I must speak now,</q> answered he with quickness,
<lb /><q>or lose for ever all that is dear to me, and add to the
<lb />misery of that loss, the heart-piercing reflection of
<lb />having injured her whom of all the world I most love,
<lb />most value, and most revere.</q></p>
<p><lb />He then tore himself away.</p>
<p><lb />In this gloomy despondence she passed the night,
<lb />her eyes never closed, her determination never
<lb />formed.  Morning, however, came, and upon some&shy;
<lb />thing to fix was indispensable.</p>
<p><lb />She now, therefore, finally employed herself in briefly
<lb />comparing the good with the evil of giving Delvile
<lb />wholly up, or becoming his for ever.</p>
<p><lb />At length, after weighing every circumstance as well
<lb />as her perturbed spirits would permit, she concluded
<lb />that so late to reject him must bring misery without
<lb />any alleviation; while accepting him, though followed
<pb n="628" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G2r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">235</mw>
<lb />by wrath and reproach, left some opening for future
<lb />hope, and some prospect of better days.</p>
<p><lb />To fulfil, therefore, her engagement, was her final
<lb />resolution.</p>
<p>	    <lb />As soon as she had power, she acquainted <persName>Mrs.
<lb />Charlton</persName> with what had passed, and assisted in pre&shy;
<lb />paring her to accompany them to the altar; while
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> flew to his new acquaintance, <persName>Mr. Singleton</persName>,
	    <lb />the lawyer, to request him to supply the place of <persName>Mr.
<lb />Monckton</persName> in giving her away.  All was now hastened
<lb />with the utmost expedition, and to avoid observation,
<lb />they agreed to meet at the church door.</p></div>

<p>
<lb />When the chairs, however, came, which were to
<lb />carry the two ladies thither, <persName>Cecilia</persName> trembled and hung
<lb />back.  The greatness of her undertaking, the hazard
<lb />of all her future happiness, the disgraceful secrecy of
	    <lb />her conduct, the expected reproaches of <persName>Mrs. Del&shy;
<lb />vile</persName>, and the boldness and indelicacy of the step she
<lb />was about to take, all so forcibly struck, and so
<lb />painfully wounded her, that the moment she was sum&shy;
<lb />moned to set out, she again lost her resolution, and
	    <lb />regretting the hour that ever <persName>Delvile</persName> was known to her,
<lb />she sunk into a chair, and gave up her whole soul to anguish
<lb />and sorrow.</p>
<p><lb />The good <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName> tried in vain to console her; a
<lb />sudden horror against herself had now seized her spirits,
<lb />which, exhausted by long struggles, could rally no more.</p>
<pb n="629" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G2v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">236</mw>
<p>
	    <lb />In this situation she was at length surprised by <persName>Delvile</persName>;
<lb />whose uneasy astonishment that she had failed in her ap&shy;
<lb />pointment, was only to be equalled by that with which
<lb />he was struck at the sight of her tears.  He demanded
<lb />the cause with the utmost tenderness and apprehension;
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> for some time could not speak, and then, with a
<lb />deep sigh, <q>Ah:</q> she cried, <q><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>! how weak are
<lb />we all when unsupported by our own esteem! how feeble,
<lb />how inconsistent, how changeable, when our courage has any
<lb />foundation but duty!</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, much relieved by finding her sadness sprung not
<lb />from any new affliction, gently reproached her breach of
<lb />promise, and earnestly entreated her to repair it.  <q>The
	      <lb />clergyman,</q> cried he, <q>is waiting; I have left him with <persName>Mr.
<lb />Singleton</persName> in the vestry.</q></p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName> had now scarce time to breathe, before she found
	    <lb />herself at the porch of&mdash;&mdash;church, <persName>Delvile</persName> hurried her out of
<lb />the carriage, and then offered his arm to <persName>Mrs. Charlton</persName>.
<lb />Not a word was spoken by any of the party till they went
	    <lb />into the vestry, where <persName>Delvile</persName> ordered <persName>Cecilia</persName> a glass of
<lb />water, and having hastily made his compliments to the clergy&shy;
	    <lb />man, gave her hand to <persName>Mr. Singleton</persName>, who led her to the
<lb />altar.</p>
<p><lb />The ceremony being soon over, <persName>Cecilia</persName> received the con&shy;
<lb />gratulations of the little party before whom it was performed,
<lb />and then returned to the carriage.</p>
<p>	    <lb />Young <persName>Delvile</persName> now ordered a chaise, and set off for <placeName>Delvile
<lb />Castle</placeName>, with a determination to acquaint his father of his
<lb />union with <persName>Cecilia</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />His reception, however, was cold and formal; he told his
<lb />father, he had come to acquiant him with an affair, which he
<lb />thought himself bound in duty and respect, to suffer no one
<lb />to communicate to him but himself; here he was instantly
<lb />interrupted by his father, who declared, that if it concerned
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, he would not listen to it.  Mortimer attempted to re&shy;
<lb />monstrate upon this injustice, when he passionately broke
<pb n="630" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G3r" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(right)">237</mw>
<lb />forth into new and horrible charges against <persName>Cecilia</persName>, affirming
<lb />that he had them from authority, as indisputable as ocular de&shy;
<lb />monstration.</p>
<p><lb />He assured his father, some gross imposition had been prac&shy;
<lb />tised upon him, and earnestly conjured him no longer to con&shy;
<lb />ceal from whom.</p>
<p><lb />This unfortunately increased his rage; <q>imposition,</q> he
<lb />said, <q>was not so easily played upon him, he left that for
<lb />his son who was so easily duped:  as for himself he had only
<lb />given credit to a man of much consideration in Suffolk, who
<lb />had know <persName>Cecilia</persName> from a child, and who had rescued her
	      <lb />from the hands of <name>Jews</name> at his own hazard and loss, and had
<lb />actually shewed him bonds, acknowledging immense debts,
<lb />which were signed with her own hands.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb /><persName>Mortimer</persName> here lost his temper, and demanded even with
<lb />fierceness his author, whom he scrupled not to execrate as he
<lb />deserved.  He coldly replied, <q>he was bound by an oath, never
<lb />to reveal him, nor should he repay his honourable attention to
<lb />his family, by a breach of his own word.</q>  <q rend="pre(&amp;ldquo;)post()">To mention
	      <lb />honour,</q> cried <persName>Mortimer</persName>, <q>is all a farce, where such infamous
<lb />calumnies are listened to, and I here pledge myself, by all I
<lb />hold sacred, never to rest till I have cleared the fame of Ce&shy;
<lb />celia, by the detection of this villany.</q></p>
<p><lb />In so much wrath, there was little room for narration, and
<lb />the son left his father, without even acquainting him with his
<lb />marriage, but not till in his rage of asserting his authority, he
<lb />had unwarily named his informant who was no other than the
	    <lb />deceitful <persName>Monckton</persName>.</p>
<p><lb />Delvile now returned to <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and acquainted her with
<lb />every particular relative to his unsuccessful visit.  <q>Ah me,</q>
<lb />cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>you have then quarrelled with your
<lb />father.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>I have,</q> said he; <q>oh, return, then to him directly,</q>
<lb />cried she, <q>he is your father, you are bound to bear with his
<lb />displeasure, alas! had you never known me, you would never
<lb />have incurred it.</q>  <q>Believe me,</q> he answered, <q>I am ill
<pb n="631" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G3v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">238</mw>
<lb />at ease under it.  If you wish it, I will go to him imme&shy;
<lb />diately, if not I will write, and you shall yourself dictate
<lb />what.</q></p>
<p>	    <lb />At this instant <persName>Dr. Lyster</persName>, a kind and worthy friend of young
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName>, suddenly knocked at the room door.</p>
<p>	    <lb />After being seated, <persName>Delvile</persName> in a little time disclosed to him
<lb />his secret marriage with <persName>Cecilia</persName>, and related at the same time
	    <lb />the result of his visit to <placeName>Delvile Castle</placeName>.  The Doctor heard
<lb />every particular with the keenest emotions of friendship, and
<lb />determined instantly to leave <placeName>London</placeName>, and endeavour to ne&shy;
<lb />gotiate a general reconciliation.</p>
<p><lb />In a few days he succeeded beyond his most ardent ex&shy;
<lb />pectation.  <persName>Mr. Delvile</persName> requested him to send immediately
<lb />for his son, whom, even with tears he embraced, and felt his
<lb />own peace restored as he pronounced his forgiveness.</p>
<p><lb />New, however, to kindness, he retained it not long, and a
<lb />stranger to generosity, he knew not how to make here welcome;
	    <lb />the extinction of his remorse abated his compassion for <persName>Ce&shy;
<lb />cilia</persName>, and when solicited to receive her, he revived the charges
<lb />of <persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>.</p>
<p><lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>, informed of this, determined to write to that gen&shy;
<lb />tleman herself, whose long and painful illness, joined to his
<lb />irrecoverable loss of her, she now hoped might prevail with
<lb />him to make reparation for injuries he had done her.</p>

<p>
<lb /><persName>Mr. Monckton</persName>, after many long and painful struggles be&shy;

<div type="letter">
		  <salute rend="case(smallcaps)">To <persName>Mrs. Mortimer Delvile</persName>.</salute>
<p>
<lb />Those who could ever believe you guilty, must have been
<lb />eager to think you so.  I meant but your welfare at all times,
<lb />and to have saved you from a connection I never thought
<lb />equal to your merit.  I am grieved, but not surprised to hear
<lb />of your injuries; from the alliance you have formed, nothing
<lb />else could be expected:  if my testimony to your innocence can,
<lb />however, serve to mitigate them, I scruple not to declare I
<lb />believe it without taint.</p>
</div>
</body></text></q>
<p>
	    <lb /><persName>Delvile</persName> sent this letter to his father, whose rage at the de&shy;
<lb />tection of the perfidy which had deceived him, was yet inferior
<lb />to what he felt that his family was mentioned so injuriously.</p>
<p>	    <lb />His conference with <persName>Dr. Lyster</persName> was long and painful, but
<lb />decisive:  that sagacious and friendly man knew well how to
<lb />work upon his passions, and so effectually awakened them by
<lb />representing the disgrace of his own family from the present
<lb />situation of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, that before he quitted his house he was
<lb />authorised to invite her to remove it.</p>
<p><lb />When he returned from his embassy, he found Delvile in
<lb />her room, and waiting with impatience the event of his
<lb />negociation.</p>
<p><lb />The Doctor with much alacrity, gave <persName>Cecilia</persName> the invitation
	    <lb />with which he had been charged; but <persName>Delvile</persName>, jealous for her
<lb />dignity, was angry and dissatisfied his father brought it not
<lb />himself, and exclaimed with much mortification, <q>Is this all
<lb />the grace accorded me?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>Patience, patience, Sir,</q> answered the Doctor:  <q>when
<lb />you have thwarted any body in their first hope and ambition,
<lb />do you expect they will send you their compliments and
<pb n="633" />
<milestone unit="sig" n="2G4v" />
<mw type="pageNum" rend="align(left)">240</mw>
<lb />many thanks for the disappointment?  Pray let the good gen&shy;
<lb />tleman have his way in some little matters, since you have
<lb />taken such effectual care to put out of his reach the power of
<lb />having it in greater.</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>O, far from starting obstacles,</q> cried <persName>Cecilia</persName>, <q>let us so&shy;
<lb />licit a reconciliation with whatever concessions he may require:
<lb />and thinking as we think of filial ties and parental claims, how
<lb />can we ever hope happiness till forgiven and taken into
<lb />favour?</q></p>
<p><lb /><q>True, my <persName>Cecilia</persName>,</q> answered Delvile, <q>and generous and
<lb />condescending as true:  and if <emph>you</emph> can thus sweetly comply, I
<lb />will gratefully forbear making any opposition.</q></p>
<p><lb />When <persName>Cecilia</persName> was a little recovered from the shock of the
<lb />first interview, and the fatigue of her removal, the anxious
<lb />Mortimer would instantly have had her conveyed to her own
<lb />apartment; but, willing to exert herself, and hoping to oblige
<lb /><persName>Mr. Delvile</persName>, she declared she was well able to remain some
<lb />time longer in the drawing-room.</p>
<p><lb />She then ran away; and they all separated:  <persName>Cecilia</persName> was
	    <lb />conveyed up stairs, and the worthy <persName>Dr. Lyster</persName>, loaded with
<lb />acknowledgments of every kind, set out for the country.</p>
<p><lb />Here tranquillity once more made its abode in the heart of
<lb /><persName>Cecilia</persName>!  <persName>Mrs. Delvile</persName> received her with the most rapturous
<lb />fondness, and the impressions of her sorrows, gradually wore
<lb />away, from her kind and maternal cares, and from the watch&shy;
<lb />ful affection and delighted tenderness of her son.</p>
<p>	    <lb />The wretched <persName>Monckton</persName>, dupe of his own cunning and ar&shy;
<lb />tifices, still lived in lingering misery, doubtful which was
<lb />most acute, the pain of his wound and confinement, or of his
<lb />defeat and disappointment.</p>
<p><lb />The upright mind of <persName>Cecilia</persName>, her purity, her virtue, and the
<lb />moderation of her wishes, gave to her in the warm affection of
	    <lb /><persName>Lady Delvile</persName>, and the unremitting fondness of <persName>Mortimer</persName>, all
<lb />the happiness human life seems capable of receiving.</p></div>
