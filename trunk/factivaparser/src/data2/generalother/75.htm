<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A man with a severe inherited blood disorder has become the first patient of his kind to be treated successfully with gene therapy (Mark Henderson writes).</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Frenchman, 21, who suffers from beta-thalassaemia, no longer requires the monthly blood transfusions that he has needed since childhood to control his condition. He now works in his first full-time job as a chef in Paris. His dramatic improvement, reported in the journal Nature, came after doctors treated his bone marrow cells with a genetically modified virus to correct the faulty DNA that causes the disorder, a form of anaemia.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCOTTISH scientists have developed a cancer treatment that uses "seek and destroy" DNA capable of eliminating tumours in less than a fortnight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts at Strathclyde and Glasgow universities announced they had developed a gene therapy treatment to hit tumours with no harmful side-effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Laboratory tests have found that the system, which sends therapeutic DNA to tumours via proteins in the blood, completely destroyed some cancerous growths within just 10 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy has so far been limited due to difficulties in ensuring DNA destroys the tumour without damaging healthy tissue around it.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But Scottish researchers have devised a way of programming genes to attack only cancerous cells, giving hope that it can eventually be used in the treatment of hard-to-reach tumours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research has been hailed as a major breakthrough after being published this month in the influential Journal of Controlled Release.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Christine Dufes, a lecturer at the Strathclyde Institute of Pharmacy and Biomedical Sciences and leader of the research, said: "The tumours were completely gone within 10 days. It is fantastic. That is the time frame for curing a cold. Imagine if within 10 days a tumour completely disappeared."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment involves the use of a plasma protein called transferring, which carries iron through the blood, to deliver the therapeutic DNA to the right spot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique has only been tested on skin cancer cells, but researchers hope to be able to adapt it to other forms of the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the tests, 90 per cent of tumours completely disappeared within a month of being targeted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Journal of Controlled Release editor Professor Kinam Park, of Purdue University, Indiana, in the USA, said: "Usually, the targeted delivery systems result in suppression of tumour growth, but they have seldom shown complete disappearance of tumours.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There is no doubt a highly efficient gene delivery system will be developed, and for now Dr Dufes seems to be at the forefront of achieving such a goal."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cancer treatment remains broadly reliant on three rather blunt instruments. A tumour can be cut out with a scalpel, burnt away with radiation, or poisoned with chemotherapy. All can have brutal side-effects, and their lack of precision makes it hard to predict which is most likely to work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The great promise of cancer genomics is to replace these carpet-bombing tactics with the equivalent of laser-guided smart weapons. By identifying the precise genetic mutations that are driving a tumour, it should be possible to attack these with targeted therapies that are much more effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A handful of drugs that work this way have already been developed. Herceptin (trastuzumab), for example, can be highly effective against breast tumours, provided that they carry a particular genetic mutation, and Glivec (imatinib) has transformed treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The studies of small-cell lung cancer and malignant melanoma published yesterday can be expected to lead to the development of many more drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By cataloguing every genetic mutation present in the tumours of two patients, these studies have already shed important light on the natural history of two forms of cancer that are difficult to treat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their power, however, will grow appreciably as hundreds of tumours are sequenced over the coming years. Scientists will be able to compare the results to identify mutations that are commonly present, and that are thus likely to be causing cancerous growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Other studies, such as one begun by Professor Mike Stratton's team, will test a wide range of drugs against tumours with known genetic signatures, to identify those that target this mutation or that.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will emerge is a new paradigm for cancer medicine in which every patient's tumour is sequenced, before being treated according to its genetic profile rather than its position in the body.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two patients with lung cancer may well turn out to have entirely different diseases from a genetic point of view, which will respond to different treatment strategies. And patients with genetically similar tumours in different organs may benefit from the same drug.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A mutation in a gene called BRAF, found a few years ago by Professor Stratton's team, illustrates this. It is a driver not only of many melanomas but also of some bowel tumours. This suggests that drugs that target BRAF could be suitable for both types of cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If this cancer revolution is to happen, however, it will require significant investment, both for research and by the NHS. As Sir John Bell, one of Britain's foremost experts on genomic medicine, told The Times last week, NHS provision of genetic tests in existing cancer medicines is patchy. The challenge will become greater when doctors want to sequence every cancer patient's tumour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Government needs to think hard about this and how to store the mountains of data that will be generated. Today's NHS IT system is certainly not up to scratch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On Monday, the Department of Health announced the creation of a Human Genomics Strategy Group to consider these issues. It is important that ministers take its advice seriously.</p>

</div><div class="author">Mark Henderson Science Editor   </div><div>674 words</div><div>6 November 2009</div><div>The Times</div><div>T</div><div>1</div><div>21</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 Times Newspapers Limited. All rights reserved   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A devastating brain disease that kills boys by the time of adolescence has been stopped in its tracks by a gene therapy that raises hope for thousands of families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment has halted the development of adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) — the genetic disorder featured in the film Lorenzo's Oil — in two Spanish boys aged 7 who would otherwise have suffered progressive and ultimately fatal brain damage. The work suggests that ALD can be prevented by correcting the mutant gene responsible. The treatment may also be suitable for adults with a lateonset form of the condition. The therapy's powerful approach to altering defective DNA should also aid the development of therapies for other inherited conditions, such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This gives children with ALD and their families the hope of a future," said Patrick Aubourg, Professor of Paediatrics at Paris Descartes University, who led the research. "We have to be cautious. We can't yet say it's safe. But I hope one day this will be a cure." Nathalie Cartier, his colleague, said: "The cognitive function of these boys has completely stabilised. They will still have some minor consequences of cerebral ALD but they go to school, have a normal family life and social life. Children who don't receive treatment are in a terrible state. They don't feed, don't talk, they go blind and deaf, and eventually die."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disease, which affects one boy in 20,000, is caused by a mutation in the ALD gene. The mutation causes the loss of protective myelin coverings from nerve cells. In about 55 per cent of cases, symptoms start between the ages of 6 and 8, causing brain damage and death by the teenage years. The remaining 45 per cent of male carriers develop a less severe form in adulthood, though this can still cause brain damage, paralysis and death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALD can sometimes be alleviated by Lorenzo's Oil, a drug created in America by Augusto and Michaela Odone to treat their son, Lorenzo, whose story is told in Lorenzo's Oil starring Nick Nolte and Susan Sarandon. Lorenzo, once the oldest survivor of childhood ALD, died last year at 30.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disease can also be treated with bone marrow transplants, which supply stem cells to replenish brain and spine tissue. These, however, require a perfectly-matched donor, and carry significant risks. "Mortality is 15 per cent in children and 30 to 40 per cent in adults," Professor Aubourg said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study, published in the journal Science, researchers turned to gene therapy for two boys for whom no donor was available.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REVOLUTIONARY gene therapy can cure a severe form of inherited blindness in days, groundbreaking trials show.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early results of the pioneering treatment, which transplants genes into the eye, produced dramatic results.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts believe the therapy could be ready for use within two y ears to treat people suffering from some inherited diseases of the retina - which affect 30,000 people in Britain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within three years, it could be ready for testing on people who suffer age-related macular degeneration, a common condition affecting 500,000 Britons.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors in the latest US trial injected a virus containing a corrective gene into one eye of three patients in their 20s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All three suffered from Leber's congenital amaurosis. One in 100,000 babies are born with the condition, and their sight starts to deteriorate rapidly from birth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many sufferers go blind when they are adults.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the patients responded within days. And in just a month, all had improved significantly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In each patient the treated eye was more sensitive to light and its field of vision increased, allowing a wider area to be "seen".</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial picks up on pioneering surgery carried out by British eye specialists at London's world-famous Moorfields Eye Hospital last year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors aimed to replace a defective gene called RPE65, which plays an essential role in helping to turn light signals into nerve messages to the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When this "retinoid cycle" breaks down, the faulty gene stops the retina from detecting light and sight fails.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists at the Scheie Eye Institute at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, detected huge improvements to the retina's light-sensitive cone and rod cells after treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cone function - responsible for colour and daytime vision - increased up to 50-fold. Rods, which provide night vision, became as much as 63,000 times more effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers wrote in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences: "These results demonstrate dramatic, albeit imperfect, recovery of rod and cone photoreceptor-based vision after RPE65 gene therapy."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">James Bainbridge, who led the Moorfields surgical team, hailed the results, saying: "They are important because they provide further evidence that gene therapy can improve vision in people with this form of LCA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They also confirm the prediction that the extent of improvement depends on the number of surviving target cells."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Barbara McLaughlan, of the Royal National Institute of Blind People, welcomed the research into a form of blindness for which there has been no treatment.</p>

</div><div class="author">Craig Lord   </div><div>905 words</div><div>22 July 2008</div><div>The Times</div><div>T</div><div>62</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2008 Times Newspapers Limited. All rights reserved   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Startling new evidence of a burgeoning underground doping culture in China emerged last night as a hospital doctor said that he was prepared to give illegal performance-enhancing gene therapy treatment to an Olympic swimmer. The doctor was caught on camera by a German television investigator saying that he wanted Pounds 12,000 for a two-week treatment that would help to strengthen the lungs of a fictitious American swimmer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The documentary, broadcast by ARD on Germany's main channel last night, went on to show evidence that drugs firms in China are prepared to sell steroids that have not passed full clinical trials, as well as EPO (erythropoietin), the blood-boosting drug, at a price far cheaper than in the West. In the case of one steroid, 100g was sold for Euro 150 (about Pounds 120) when the price in Europe would have been more than Euro 6,000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The film, Flying High in Middle Kingdom, produced with the help of evidence from The Times, also disclosed that Xu Huigin, a female swimming coach who has served two doping suspensions after her athletes tested positive for steroids, is a serving member of the China team's staff. It is an appointment that appears to fly in the face of Chinese state policy to ban doping cheats for life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the Olympics beginning in Beijing in a little more than two weeks, the documentary evidence of cheap, on-demand gene therapy alarmed David Howman, the director general of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada). "This is worse than my worst fears," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the head of a hospital gene therapy department in China was approached by a fictitious American swimming coach seeking stem-cell treatment for one of his swimmers, the doctor replied: "Yes. We have no experience with sportspeople here, but the treatment is safe and we can help you."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked how it would work, the doctor said: "It strengthens lung function and stem cells go into the bloodstream and reach the organs. It takes two weeks. I recommend four intravenous injections ... 40million stem cells or double that, the more the better. We also use human growth hormones, but you have to be careful because they are on the doping list."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And the price? "Twenty-four thousand dollars," the doctor said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Howman admitted to finding the material in the documentary "very distressing". "It is very scary that health professionals should have such a lack of ethics and try what we know to be experimental on human beings for a vast amount of money," he said. "What they are proposing to do is a total breach of the prohibited list of the standards we have implied to make sure that cheating through the use of gene doping or gene therapy is prohibited."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigators also approached a Chinese company called Gen Sci, which recently had its licence for human growth hormone temporarily revoked by the Chinese Government. That did not prevent them offering to do business. When asked if the company could supply steroids and EPO, investigators were asked to pick up the substances personally, to get round the pre-Games crackdown on selling illegal substances on the black market. EPO and a steroid called estradiendione were offered. One hundred grams of the steroid cost 1,500 yuan (about Pounds 100). It came with quality control certification and proved to be a bargain. The cost in Europe is upwards of Pounds 4,500 per 100g, according to Mario Thevis, an expert at a laboratory in Cologne.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To add to China's embarrassment, Huang Xiaomin, a silver medal- winner as an 18-year-old, in the 200metres breaststroke at the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul, tells the documentary that members of the national team of which she was a member were fed steroids in their early teens. Now a coach in South Korea, she said: "We were administered the substances at regular intervals. It always happened in a room at our dormitory. My voice sounded more and more manly and my Adam's apple was extremely big. Male characteristics came through stronger and stronger as time went by. I had lots of health problems later on. It (doping) totally transformed me. It was as if I was ill. I had no will to live."</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCIENTISTS are on the threshold of a breakthrough in gene therapy that could wipe out a range of killer diseases and even delay ageing.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They believe they can correct mutations in genetic material called mitochondria – the "power plant" of cells – which trigger illnesses such as diabetes, Parkinson's, stroke, Alzheimer's, heart disease and cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gradual build-up of these faulty genes over a lifetime is also thought to be an important cause of ageing but attempts to introduce normal genes into mitochondria to replace defective ones have so far proved unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However a new technique tags genes with cellular "post codes" that tell them where to go – in much the same way as a letter is posted – which crucially will take them across the mitochondrial membrane of cells grown in the lab.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Marisol Corral-Debrinski and colleagues at the Pierre and Marie Curie University in Paris picked two mitochondrial gene mutations – one that causes a syndrome characterised by muscle weakness, lack of coordination and retinal problems and another which is responsible for a form of blindness called LHON.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers tagged normal versions of these genes with two separate cellular "address codes" and inserted them into the cytoplasm of cells grown in a lab dish.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These double-tagged genes were able to completely reverse the effect of both mitochondrial mutations in the cell cultures for up to a year. </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The first trial of gene therapy to treat Parkinson's disease has produced encouraging results, giving patients better control of their movements for at least a year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors in the US injected into the brains of a dozen Parkinson's sufferers a gene designed to calm the brain cells that lead to uncontrolled movements. Although the trial was designed to assess only the safety of the procedure and not its efficacy, the patients did show marked improvements, beginning some weeks or months after the treatment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These exciting results need to be validated in a larger trial, but we believe this is a milestone, not only for the treatment of Parkinson's disease but also the use of gene-based therapies against neurological conditions generally," said Michael Kaplitt, of Weill Cornell Medical College.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The injections were made on only one side of the brain, although the patients had symptoms on both sides of the body. The results show that the benefits were felt primarily on the treated side of the body and persisted until the study concluded a year after the treatments had been given.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gene used was the one responsible for making glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD). It was linked to a common but unactivated virus to carry it into brain cells, and the compound was then injected directly inot the brain. "GAD makes a chemical called GABA that helps quiet excessive neuronal firing," said Matthew During, a co-author of the study, published in The Lancet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In Parkinson's disease, patients develop substantial reductions in the activity and amount of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) in their brains. This causes a dysfunction in brain circuitry responsible for co-ordinating movement."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By inserting the gene, the hope was that GABA production could be boosted and the brain circuits normalised. "Because this was the first study of its kind, we targeted just safety," Dr During said. "However, since the patients were symptomatic on both sides of the brain, this also provided the untreated side for comparison." The improvements in movement were seen both when patients were taking drugs and when they were not -the "on" and "off" states.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The improvements represented about a 25 to 30 per cent change in the standard scale used to measure the severity of Parkinson's symptoms. Some patients showed improvements as great as 65 per cent.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'Magic bullets' for killer diseases were once the medical goal, but only now is the true value of genetics being understood -and it's the many, not the few, who will benefit   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was quite a vision of our genetic future. Shortly before the first drafts of the human genome were unveiled in 2001, Francis Collins spelt out in bold terms what the project he had pioneered would ultimately mean for medicine.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By 2010, scientists would understand how genes contribute to at least a dozen common illnesses such as diabetes and heart disease, the director of the US National Human Genome Research Institute said. Preventive therapies would soon be developed to match.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A new era of bespoke medicine lay ahead, in which drugs tailored to individuals' genetic profiles would replace the traditional "one-size-fits-all" approach.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Insights from humanity's genetic code were poised to transform healthcare.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just a year ago, Dr Collins's timetable looked like fantasy. Science had had a version of the genome for five years, and parts of it for longer still, yet it had added surprisingly little to knowledge of the genetic roots of common diseases.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The promised revolution had yet to begin.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is now under way. This week's announcement that four common genes have been reliably linked to breast cancer is only the latest and most spectacular of a series of remarkable results that have led cautious scientists to speak openly of a tipping point in their understanding of how DNA affects our health.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scores of genes that cause or influence disease are now known to science, but until recently it has been difficult to identify any that contribute to the greatest causes of ill-health in the modern world -diabetes and heart disease, mental illness and most cancers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The successes of the first phase of genome research were limited largely to genetic mutations that have devastating effects but for very few people, such as those that cause Huntington's disease and cystic fibrosis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Four out of five women with mutated BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes will develop the disease.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only one in 500, however, carries these defects in the first place. Their discovery has transformed screening for a small minority, but it means nothing for more than 95 per cent of the 44,000 British women whose breast cancer is diagnosed each year.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have long known, from family and twin studies, that other genetic factors affect women's risk, but hitherto it has been impossible to pinpoint what they are. The same has been true of heart disease, diabetes, and other modern plagues.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All that is finally starting to change. After years of treading water, geneticists have started to publish a cascade of data about very common genetic variants that can subtly influence people's risk of developing common diseases.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new breast cancer genes, discovered by a team assembled by Cancer Research UK, have much less of an effect than the BRCA genes: the most damaging genetic profile raises the lifetime risk to about 17 per cent. But they are much, much more common: one variant is carried by one in six women, and the rarest by one in 16.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That discovery followed the announcement in April of the first common gene that has been shown reliably to contribute to obesity. Again, the risk is low, but many are affected: one in six has inherited versions of the FTO gene that raise it by 70 per cent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar studies have identified common genetic variants that predispose to heart disease and type-2 diabetes. Next week a Wellcome Trust consortium will publish details of many more that are linked to seven major conditions, including high blood pressure, bipolar disorder and rheumatoid arthritis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Where genetics was once capable of pinning down only rare mutations with a catastrophic impact, it is now tracing variants with smaller effects that are much more widespread. You might call it the democratisation of the genome.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Democratisation is a good word for it," said Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust, the British biomedical charity that has funded much of the key research. "What we are finding now is relevant to everyone, not just to those rare families who happen to be exceptionally unfortunate."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Professor Bruce Ponder of the University of Cambridge, whose team identified the new breast cancer genes, said: "The genes we have seen so far are strong genes for spectacular stuff, but this is the real genetics that underlies variation in the population at large. These are the genes that affect how people react to their environments, and that influences, however slightly, their chances of developing common diseases."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This step change has been brought about by new technology and a change of approach. Traditional gene hunts have relied on a technique called linkage analysis, in which scientists study families in which several members have developed an inherited disorder. DNA samples from individuals with the disease are compared with samples from those who are unaffected. About a hundred subjects are usually enough, and no more than 300 DNA markers generally need to be scanned.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While this is efficient, it works only for genes with a large impact, raising risk by at least 200 per cent. Most genetic variants do not work like that, and to find them scientists have turned to a new method called whole genome association.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such studies use unrelated subjects and need to be much larger. The Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium, which found the FTO gene and publishes more results next week, compares 2,000 people with particular diseases with 3,000 unaffected controls. As the subjects are not related, scientists must also look at hundreds of thousands of DNA markers to find any effects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This approach can find common variants, which raise risks by as little as 10 to 20 per cent. The drawback is the vast amount of data that must be processed -it has become possible only with the advent of microarrays or "gene chips" that can scan hundreds of thousands of genetic markers at once.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is this that has enabled the spectacular recent advances. "It's been known in principle that whole genome association studies should be more powerful, but only in the last two years has it become affordable to do them with the large sample sizes we need," said Peter Donnelly, of the University of Oxford, who chairs the Case Control Consortium.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Since the genome was published, progress has been slower than people had hoped, but the pace has zoomed now. Each week and month, exciting new findings for important diseases are being published. That pace will continue. What we knew just a year ago is enormously different from what we know now."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This enhanced knowledge is changing the way scientists think about genes and disease. It is now recognised that there are very few conditions that are caused by single genes with big effects -the influence usually comes from dozens of genes, each of which has only a minor impact on its own. "We are mostly finding that for any given disease there are zero or at best one or two genes with large effects," said Mark McCarthy of the University of Oxford, who led the team that found FTO's effect on obesity.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Then there is a sprinkling of genes, perhaps five to ten, with modest effects of 10-20 per cent, and there may be many hundreds with even smaller effects."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For many conditions, indeed, these smaller effects may be all there are. Robert Plomin of the Institute of Psychiatry in London, who specialises in behavioural disorders such as autism, doubts whether whole genome association will even find many moderate effects in his field.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This means that the genome will rarely provide medicine with "magic bullets" that tackle disease by correcting faulty genes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, most of the variants that contribute to a high risk of breast cancer or diabetes are common, and are thus likely to have other important functions. We would use genetic engineering or gene therapy to alter them at our peril. Then there is the problem of numbers. So many different genes are playing a minor role that it is implausible to think we might correct them all.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The real value of this knowledge will thus be in understanding the basic biology of common diseases that affect millions, so scientists can design better drugs to target the processes that our genes set in train. It should also allow the development of tests for gene combinations that create a significant risk.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would then allow patients and their doctors to manipulate a factor that almost invariably interacts with genes to affect disease, and which is much easier to control: the environment. Women with a high breast cancer risk could be referred for more frequent screening. Those in danger of heart disease might change their diet and exercise patterns. In some cases, drugs will be appropriate, to change the biochemical environment in which genes operate in the body.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we are going to get out of this in the end is not genetic engineering, but environmental engineering," Dr Plomin said. "A lot is going to be about changing behaviour, about education. It's not always going to be: you've got this genetic problem and here's a pill. Most genetic effects are going to be too small for that."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">* GIVING UP THEIR SECRETS   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New data to be published in the journal Nature this week identified four new genes and one region of the genome that raise the risk of the disease   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sir, The most optimistic interpretation of your report ("Daily pill to beat genetic diseases", April 23) is that, of the 7,500 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients in the United Kingdom, around 300 could benefit. However, this type of treatment is not new and studies with similar drugs have shown, at best, only small changes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A specific gene therapy treatment has been developed by the UK Cystic Fibrosis Gene Therapy Consortium, funded by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust. This treatment is not designed to repair or assist a defective gene, but to add a healthy copy of the gene to affected tissues. The treatment is not mutation-specific and is, in effect, a "one size fits all" therapy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The focal point of our gene therapy research is the lung which, given that more than 90 per cent of CF sufferers die of lung disease, is an obvious first target.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, CF is a multi-organ disease. If gene therapy for the lung is effective, those with CF will still have problems with their digestive system and other organs. We hope to be able to prevent CF from being a life-threatening disease and to improve quality of life.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hope is high that the clinical trials which are about to start with our inhaled gene therapy will demonstrate real and effective management of the disease. We are, however, always careful to present our research in a realistic way, and never to offer false hope.   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah have announced that their baby son suffers from cystic fibrosis. Here, TINA LIGHTFOOT explains what it is like to bring up a daughter who has the disease while DR THOMAS STUTTAFORD looks at new advances in treating it  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although cystic fibrosis wasn't described until the Thirties, one of its characteristic features, excessively salty sweat, has been known about for centuries. A Swiss nursery tale includes the worrying warning line: "Woe is the child who tastes salty from a kiss on the brow, for he is cursed and soon must die." A medical textbook written in 1705 suggested that if a child's sweat was unusually salty, the child was bewitched and unlikely to survive. The association between the devil, witches and salt was then firmly established in folk law.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1938 cystic fibrosis was described in the American Journal of Diseases of Children and was accepted as a diagnosis, but it wasn't understood or widely known about until many years later. There was for example no mention of it in Sir Wilfred Sheldon's textbook of Diseases of the Infancy and Childhood published in 1951, and only a glancing reference in The Principles and Practice of Medicine, edited by Sir Stanley Davidson in 1952.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Retrospective studies have shown that during the First World War (1939-45), a child born with the condition was likely to live for just one year. Initially, neither GPs nor, surprisingly, paediatricians were enormously interested in the condition because they assumed that, as every system in the body was likely to become involved, the patient's life-span would be short and his or her existence miserable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This once-defeatist attitude has been reversed by an understanding of the causes of cystic fibrosis and the measures that can be taken to prevent the disease and lessen the impact of its symptoms. A once debilitated baby is now able to look forward to a reasonably good quality of life and to live to early middle-age. In fact, life expectancy has increased so rapidly over the past 50 years that it is now impossible to predict the likely prognosis of a baby.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much of the progress in treatment must be credited to the Cystic Fibrosis Trust ( www.cftrust.org.uk [http://www.cftrust.org.uk]) which has fought its corner so effectively that it has attracted top-class paediatricians and geneticists. Such is the interest in the condition now that there has been no lack of pharmaceutical research into its treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cystic fibrosis is the most common life-threatening and shortening genetic disease. The gene is carried by 3 per cent of the white population (it's less often found in non-Caucasian races). There are about 7,500 people in the United Kingdom with the condition -about half are children.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is inherited as the result of autosomal recessive genes; this means that its genetic nature is always inherited from both parents. As well as altering the salt content of sweat, it causes the mucus produced by exocrine glands to be thick and sticky so that essential organs become clogged.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most common manifestation is COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, better known as chronic bronchitis and emphysema, where the airways leading to the lungs become blocked with the sticky mucus so that the lung tissue beyond the obstruction becomes infected and destroyed and the patient becomes progressively more and more breathless.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the most dangerous times for a child with cystic fibrosis is immediately after birth as abnormal secretions into the small intestine can cause obstruction.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As this affects 15 to 20 per cent of children with the condition, it may be the first sign. It also attacks the pancreas in 70 to 80 per cent of patients, damaging their digestive systems. Without replacement therapy medication, these children would fail to thrive and in adulthood about 10 per cent develop diabetes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The condition is now managed by medication, including antibiotics -especially tobramycin and colistin that are delivered in ever more cunning ways. Muculitics, such as DNase (pulmozyme), are equally important in treatment and can ease the stickiness of the mucus. Digestive enzymes aid nutrition and daily physiotherapy also helps a patient to cough up the clogging mucus.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As cystic fibrosis is a multi-system disease, it must be treated with the holistic care that can be delivered only in specialist centres in which the staff, whether doctors, geneticists, nurses, dieticians or physiotherapists -treat 50 to 100 patients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neo-natal screening should be available throughout England -presently, it is available only in Scotland and patchily in England. Future research may prevent the condition with gene therapy but, until then, all babies should be tested at birth and testing for anyone with a family history should be routine.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">People with muscular dystrophy, the inherited, incurable muscle-wasting disease, could soon be treated with genetically modified stem cells taken from their own bodies, research has suggested (Mark Henderson writes).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dogs that have the canine equivalent of Duchenne muscular dystrophy -which in humans causes most sufferers to lose the ability to walk before their teens and die in their twenties as their hearts weaken -improved significantly after the therapy, scientists reported.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Italian team's findings, published in Nature, should allow human trials of the technique within two years. Experts have said that they do not know whether stem cells would have similar effects in humans but that the study offered the best evidence yet that the condition's effects could be stopped or reversed.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A NEW form of gene therapy could be used to treat impotence in diabetic men (Mark Henderson writes).  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Research in the US has shown that replacing a faulty gene in rats with the equivalent of diabetes can improve their erectile function, suggesting that a similar approach might be useful in diabetic men.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 70 per cent of diabetic men suffer from impotence at some point, and about half of them do not respond well to standard drug treatments such as Viagra. An effective gene therapy could be given as an injection, which might last about a month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study, a team led by Jesse Mills, of the University of Colorado Health Sciences Centre, in Denver, first induced diabetes-like symptoms in male rats, which developed erection problems as a result. The researchers then injected the animals' penises with extra copies of a gene involved in the growth of a key signalling chemical that is important to erections.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Diabetic rats that were given the gene therapy showed a significant increase in erectile pressure, compared with control animals. Dr Mills is now planning to conduct human trials of the technique, which he hopes will be ready for treating patients within five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Mills told the American Society for Reproductive Medicine conference that the gene therapy coupled with Viagra could restore 92 to 93 per cent of erectile function. He said: "We envision that diabetic men will be able to visit the clinic for an injection and for a month after they'll be ready to go."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SCIENTISTS are hailing gene therapy as the revolutionary treatment which could cure Parkinson's disease after tests proved successful.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A study has shown that 12 patients given gene therapy saw up to a 65 per cent improvement in symptoms and had few side effects in what Kieran Breen, the director of research at the Parkinson's Disease Society, sees as an exciting step forward.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These studies are still in their early stages but y ou realise that in 15 years it may be possible to treat Parkinson's in a completely different way, " he said. "If we are looking at one day finding a cure, then this sort of work could hold the key, " he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 120,000 people in the UK have Parkinson's, which causes rigidity, tremors and slowness of movement. Although non-fatal, the disease can result in severe disability and loss of quality of life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It is incurable and has to be controlled with drugs but this becomes more difficult and sufferers often must depend on professional care or relatives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new therapy uses a harmless virus to carry a gene called GAD directly into neurons in the region of the brain which is over-stimulated during Parkinson's disease. The gene therapy pioneered by a US biotech company showed improvements of up to 65 per cent in 12 patients who received the treatment for a year with no ill effects. Greater trials on hundreds of patients are now needed to discover whether using a virus to inject DNA into a cell could cause unforeseen problems.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Matthew During, who led the trial, announced the results at the annual meeting of the Society of Neuroscience in Atlanta, Georgia. "This trial is particularly unique and the clinical data unusually promising as the treatment was confined to one side of the brain, " he said, adding the next trial will involve both sides of the brain. </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A FORM of gene therapy that could prevent one of the commonest forms of blindness will soon be tested on patients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment for age-related macular degeneration, a progressive sight disorder that affects one in ten people aged over 60, has performed well in animals and should begin clinical trials within two years.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A similar gene therapy technique, which uses a genetically modified virus to ferry fresh DNA to cells, is also showing promise for a rare inherited sight disorder that blinds one in 100,000 children. According to scientists at the Institute of Ophthalmology at University College London, it offers the best hope of saving the sight of children with Leber's congenital amaurosis , who will otherwise go blind in their teens.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robin Ali, who is leading the institute's research team, said that preliminary work on both forms of treatment had been completed.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The blindness treatments are two of the most promising applications of gene therapy, a procedure with which scientists have been attempting for more than a decade to correct genetic faults that cause disease. The idea is to use a virus as a vector to carry packages of working DNA to replace faulty genes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In both the institute's gene therapies, a virus known as AAV is modified to carry packages of DNA before it is injected into the retina. In the macular degeneration treatment it carries a gene that blocks abnormal blood vessel growth, which is the main cause of blindness in the condition. It will not reverse damage, but Dr Ali is confident that it will stop the disorder from progressing.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The LCA treatment uses the AAV vector to carry a working version of a gene called RPE65 into the retina. When this gene is defective it leads first to the loss of peripheral and night vision, and eventually to total blindness. Most sufferers go blind in their teens.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr Ali said: "Age-related macular degeneration is one of the most common causes of blindness. We are looking at therapies that could treat some very important visual defects."   </p>

A technique for "patching over" the genetic defect in Duchenne muscular
dystrophy and restoring some muscle function has been found by
scientists at Hammersmith Hospital in London. So far, the experiments
have been tried only on mice but the results are encouraging enough to
hope that it may soon be applied to human patients, Nature Medicine
reports.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
About 100 boys, or one in every 3,500, are born each year with
Duchenne, the most serious and most common form of muscular dystrophy.
By the age of eight to 11 they cannot walk and most die from heart or
respiratory failure by the age of 30. The disease is caused by
mutations in the gene responsible for making dystrophin, a protein in
muscle fibres.

Cancer risk fails to halt 'bubble boy' gene therapy.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A gene therapy technique that has caused leukaemia in a three-year-old
French boy is to continue in Britain after experts concluded that the
benefits outweighed the risks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The French have called a moratorium while the case is investigated. But
the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee (GTAC) in Britain says that to
follow suit would condemn some boys to certain death.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Three to four cases of x-linked severe combinedimmune deficiency
(x-SCID) occur in Britain every year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Only boys are affected and they would, in the past, have been condemned
to life in a plastic bubble to protect them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
They cannot fight infection because their immune system does not
develop properly. Untreated, they are unlikely to survive beyond the
age of one.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So far, 11 children have been treated at the Necker Hospital in Paris,
and three children and one adult at Great Ormond Street Hospital for
Children, in London. The technique had been hailed as the first real
success for gene therapy until one of the French patients, a boy now
three, was found to have leukaemia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There is a safety risk but other options are so limited that on
ethical grounds GTAC decided that approval for the trial should
continue," Norman Nevin, the committee chairman, said yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technique involves removing bone marrow cells from the child and
infecting them outside the body with a disabled retrovirus to which the
correct version of the gene has been attached.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Retroviruses worm their way into the genes of the cells, incorporating
the new gene as an integral part of the genome.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When reinserted, the cells begin to work, slowly creating a functioning
immune system over a period of about six months. Once it is working the
child can be taken off antibiotics, and lead a normal life. All four
patients treated in London are doing well, with no evidence of
ill-health.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But doctors have always known of the risks. The retrovirus inserts
itself at random points along the genome, so it could locate itself
close to an important gene and disrupt its behaviour.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the French leukaemia case, the retrovirus landed close to an
oncogene, a gene known to promote cancer. The odds against this
happening are as long as ten million or more to one, according to Bobby
Gaspar, an immunologist at Great Ormond Street. But the effect had been
observed in experiments on mice.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yesterday the mother of the first patient treated, Rhys Evans, said she
would make exactly the same decision again. Marie Evans, from South
Wales, said: "When Rhys was admitted to Great Ormond Street Hospital he
was a very sick little boy who could barely lift his head. Gene therapy
was our only hope. It has saved Rhys's life; he is a happy, healthy
toddler now. We've just celebrated his second birthday, which is a
miracle."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Professor Nevin said there were 14 trials in the UK covering a wide
range of conditions including prostate and breast cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There is an exciting future for gene therapy," he said. "In five years
I expect the Great Ormond Street trials to have become routine
treatments for a lot of conditions."

Vital breakthrough for gene therapy - Technology - Analysis.
</b>

By Mark Court.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GENE therapy, a method for treating disease based on a rapidly evolving
knowledge of the role of genes in our bodies, is back in the spotlight
after Rhys Evans, a one-and-a-half-year-old boy with bubble baby
syndrome, a rare genetic disorder, was successfully treated at London's
Great Ormond Street hospital.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This treatment marked the first time that gene therapy has been used
successfully in the UK, bringing closer the possibility of its use to
treat a wide range of diseases from inherited disorders to killers such
as cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alan Kingsman, a world authority on gene therapy and chief executive of
the biotechnology company Oxford BioMedica, says: "It shows that a gene
can be used as a therapeutic agent."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Genes are the basic unit of inheritance and their role in cells is to
produce proteins, many of which are vital to the correct functioning of
the human body. Medical researchers have been aware for many years that
genes could be used in the treatment of disease but early clinical
trials failed, leading to caution and scepticism.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The successful treatment of Rhys Evans reinforces the growing belief
that gene therapy will play a vital part in the medicine chest of the
future.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Drug companies are also taking a growing interest, highlighted by the
recent acquisition of the US biotechnology company Collateral
Therapeutics by Schering AG, the German drugs group, for $200 million (
£139 million).
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A close look at the breakthrough by Adrian Thrasher, a clinical
immunologist at Great Ormond Street, gives a clear glimpse of the
potential for gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhys Evans suffered from a rare condition called severe combined immuno
deficiency disorder (SCID), which affects as few as 1 in 100,000 births
and results in the child having no resistance to infection. SCID is an
inherited disease in which a gene responsible for producing a protein
involved in the body's immune system - its natural defence network - is
faulty, leading to an inability to fight disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The problem can be traced to the development of white blood cells,
which are a key part of the immune system and are produced as needed in
bone marrow. They develop from stem cells, which have the ability to
mature into a wide range of different cells. To mature into healthy
T-cells, a type of white blood cell involved in the immune response,
they require a protein on their surface. In SCID babies this protein is
missing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Replacing the defective gene with a healthy one should, logically,
allow an SCID baby's immune system to develop normally. The process by
which Dr Thrasher achieved this formidable result involved taking bone
marrow cells out of the boy and then adding a modified virus that had
been genetically engineered to contain a healthy version of his
defective gene. The gene is packaged in a virus because viruses are
particularly good at getting into cells, depositing genetic material
and then replicating.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr Thrasher used a type of virus called an oncoretrovirus to deliver
healthy genes into Rhys Evans's bone marrow stem cells and then
injected the cells back into his blood. The cells found their own way
back to the boy's bone marrow and began to mature into properly
functioning T-cells, giving him a healthy immune system and allowing
him to live outside of his sterile bubble.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This pioneering treatment has been done only once before, at a Paris
hospital, and it heralds a new age for gene therapy. Professor Kingsman
says: "The question is how far can we extrapolate from SCID to other
illnesses."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He clearly believes the potential is huge. Oxford BioMedica is working
on gene therapy treatments for a wide range of illnesses including
cancers, Parkinson's and cardio-vascular disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He is working with Dr Thrasher on a disease called CGD, another rare
genetic disorder, though one that cannot be treated by using an
oncoretrovirus to deliver a healthy gene into a patient's cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Oxford BioMedica, however, has engineered a genetically modified
lentivirus, based on a virus that causes equine infectious anaemia in
horses. This modified virus, which has the ability to enter a stem cell
before the stem cell starts to divide into a particular type of cell,
opens up the possibility of treating a wide range of genetic disorders,
including CGD and sickle cell anaemia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Professor Kingsman says: "Lentiviral vectors have only recently been
developed to a state ready for clinical trials. In a month's time we
will go the US Food and Drug Administration to talk to them about
taking a lentiviral vector into the clinic to treat Parkinson's
disease."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Using gene therapy to treat a neuro-degenerative disease, which is not
caused by a simple genetic abnormality, underlines the potential. In
Parkinson's, the brain cells that produce dopamine, an important
neuro-transmitter, gradually die off leading to the symptoms of the
illness. Oxford BioMedica has packaged into a lentivirus three genes
that produce enzymes to enable brain cells that do not normally produce
dopamine to begin producing it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company's most advanced work is in treatments for cancer, where it
has a number of genetic approaches. For example, it is considering
moving into phase II or phase III trials of a cancer vaccine, which
combines a genetically engineered pox virus with the gene for a protein
found on many different types of tumour. When scratched on to the skin,
the modified virus is expected to stimulate the immune system to
produce antibodies against tumour cells, hence fighting off cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bubble boy Rhys Evans is paving the way for new medicines. As Professor
Kingsman says: "It is such an important result because it shows the
fundamental technology works."

Dying boy cured by pioneering gene therapy.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A BOY born with a deadly genetic disease that left him powerless to
fight infection has been cured by gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhys Evans, now 18 months old, is a normal, energetic toddler, romping
gleefully at home. But until he had the pioneering treatment at Great
Ormond Street Hospital for Children in London, he was hovering on the
verge of death.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The transformation has left his parents, Mark and Marie, from South
Wales, pinching themselves in disbelief. "If you'd seen how bad he
was," Mr Evans said yesterday. "He was skin and bone, too weak to hold
his head up. Now there's no stopping him."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
His wife, a 31-year-old teacher, said that she and her husband had been
devastated when they had learnt of their son's condition. "Now we live
at home like a normal family," Mrs Evans said. "He's been to the park
to play in the sand and get into mischief. He can walk and run around
like any normal toddler."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhys, born without a gene essential to the development of the immune
system, flourished while he retained the protection picked up from his
mother in the womb.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By the time he was ten months old, however, after a series of
life-threatening infections, he was alive thanks only to antibiotics
and intensive care. He had a condition called SCID - severe combined
immunodeficiency disorder.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Once, children with this condition were condemned to a life inside a
plastic bubble designed to protect them from infections. Today they can
be treated in intensive care units isolated from the rest of the
hospital, and visited only by the immediate family to reduce the risk
of infection. Without treatment, a child born with SCID faces death
within the first couple of years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A bone-marrow transplant can cure the condition, but finding a match
for Rhys proved difficult. He has no brothers or sisters and nobody on
the British bone-marrow register was a close enough match.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A match was eventually found in America, but by then Great Ormond
Street was ready to test a therapy previously used only in France. Mr
and Mrs Evans were offered the opportunity of gene therapy - inserting
the gene Rhys lacked into his bone-marrow stem cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
They took medical advice and decided to gamble on the experimental
treatment. One reason was that it did not involve the debilitating
chemotherapy necessary in a bone-marrow transplant between people who
are not related.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It was a very tense time," Mrs Evans said. "All we tried to do was to
keep Rhys as well as we could. We looked at both sides of the story and
decided to try the new therapy."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It involved removing a sample of Rhys's bone marrow, extracting the
stem cells from which the immune system develops and, outside the body,
treating them with a virus carrying the gene they lacked. The virus
invaded the cells and was incorporated into the cell's own genes, along
with the gene it carried. The "repaired" cells were then infused back
into Rhys's bloodstream, and his recovery began.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adrian Thrasher, the consultant paediatric immunologist who led the
gene therapy team, said that although there had been no complications
and the outcome was "really excellent", it might be premature to say
that Rhys was cured. "We will have to follow him up for years and
years, for 50 or even 70 years down the line, before we can be
absolutely sure," Dr Thrasher said. "But we're ecstatic about his
progress. We've been working in gene therapy for many years in the lab
and it's great to take that work into the clinic and see some
therapeutic success."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It took several months for Rhys to start developing normal immune
system cells, but now, nine months after the operation, he is
essentially normal. He is still taking antibiotics, but the daily,
hour-long infusions of immunoglobulin to boost his immune system are no
longer needed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The treatment used at Great Ormond Street is similar to that used
successfully at the Necker Hospital in Paris, which reported its first
success two years ago. The London team have made some modifications to
the virus to try to make its penetration into the cells more
efficient.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The research was made possible by the Jeans for Genes gene therapy
laboratory at Great Ormond Street, which opened last year. Jeans for
Genes is a charity initiative that has raised more than £12 million for
research into children's genetic diseases since it started in 1996.
This year's target is at least an additional £2.5 million. On Jeans for
Genes Day, October 4, thousands of people will wear jeans to work or
school and donate £1 each to the appeal.

BRITAIN'S first gene therapy trial to try to cure prostate cancer is
about to begin.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists will target a very toxic anti-cancer drug at 30 volunteers

the victims expected to nearly double in the next 20 years.

successful, it should help us to tackle some of the most
radiotherapy-resistant forms of the disease, " he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
First, guinea pigs will be given a harmless, inactive form of the
anti-cancer drug. Next, a genetically engineered virus will be injected
into their prostates. The virus produces a chemical that switches the
inactive drug into an active cell-destroying form. The virus will be
handicapped so it can't spread elsewhere in the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Twenty thousand British men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every
year - and it will kill half of them. The risk of falling victim grows
as a man ages. In the first part of the experiment, details of which
were given yesterday at the Global Conference for Cancer Organisations,
in Brighton, Dr James will inject the virus into 30 volunteers with
early disease to see if the virus gets into prostate cells effectively.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Patients will then receive drug infusions before the next virus
injections. The team will measure effectiveness by monitoring levels of
a chemical called PSA. These levels rise if prostate tumours grow and
diminish if they shrink.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Two years ago it emerged that a patient in an American research centre
died after receiving a similar sort of gene therapy - possibly due to a
rare immune reaction. Dr James said that he would take all possible
precautions. "There is a risk - but there's also a risk from prostate
cancer, " he said.

Scientists give gene therapy warning.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GENETIC therapies that alter the genes passed to future generations are not yet safe and should not be attempted by scientists, a major report commissioned by the world's largest scientific association says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A panel set up by the American Association for the Advancement of Science ruled yesterday that at present it would be "irresponsible" for scientists to use techniques that amounted to human genetic modification, even to prevent lethal inherited diseases such as Huntington's chorea and muscular dystrophy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So far, gene therapy has been used only in "somatic" fashion, to treat existing genetic disorders in mature body cells, and does not alter genes in reproductive cells that would cause new traits to be passed on to children.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even these treatments have proved controversial. Existing therapies have met with limited success and rely on use of a virus to transmit new DNA to defective cells. Last year a young patient died in a US clinical trial when his immune system reacted against a vector virus used in his treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Therapies involving inheritable genetic modifications (IGM) and raising ethical issues are not now acceptable, the association report said. Dr Mark Frankel, one of the report's authors, said: "IGM might change attitudes toward the human person, the nature of human reproduction, and parent-child relationships."

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A METHOD of gene therapy likely to be much safer than existing techniques has been tested successfully on mammals by a British company that intends to begin human clinical trials next year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists working for Eurogene Ltd, based in London, have transferred genes to rabbits using a genetically engin-eered virus that is harmless to humans, according to a report in this month's issue of Gene Therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The breakthrough, by a research team at the University of Kuopio in Finland, may pave the way for a safe "vector" for gene therapies to treat cancer and cardiovascular and neurological disorders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Eurogene researchers believe that the technique will prove safer and more effective as it uses a baculovirus, which is not pathogenic to humans and can carry larger quantities of genetic data. Current vectors are normally based on retroviruses, the class of viruses that includes HIV, or adenoviruses, one of which is the common cold. Both can endanger patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last year an American, Jesse Gelsinger, 18, died after taking part in a gene therapy trial at the University of Pennsylvania that sought to use a genetically modified adenovirus to cure his liver disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Pathogenic viruses are also inefficient, provoking an immune response that can destroy the vector before it has the chance to impart its genetic message to target cells.

Gene therapy shrinks tumours.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists have used a genetically engineered virus to shrink and in some cases eliminate cancerous tumours, it emerged yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tests were done on British and American patients with cancer of the head and neck. In 25 out of 30 patients who were treated with a combination of chemotherapy and the modified virus, the tumours shrank. In 19, they shrank by half or more and in eight the tumours disappeared and did not return after five months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The tests, using the virus ONYX-15, were carried out at M.D. Anderson Cancer Centre in Houston. In Nature Medicine, Dr Fadlo Khuri said: "This is the first time there has been a trial with more than just a few patients in it, where the tumours have gone away in a significant number."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Every year, 500,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with cancer of the head and neck; about 30 per cent die. Such cancers are treated at first with surgery, radiation therapy or both, but tumours return in about a third of patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David Kirn, now at the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, said the patients had been so close to death that although lives had in some cases been lengthened, none was likely to have been cured. He said the therapy, if used to treat patients where the cancer was in an earlier stage, could "lead to cures. This is a step in that direction."

Gene therapy 'cures' immune deficiency.

Three French babies have been successfully treated for a crippling disease by gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
They were born with immune systems so ineffective that the only way for them to survive was to live inside plastic "bubbles", cut off from the outside world and its germs. The babies were treated with a gene which triggered immune system cells into operation. So far two of the infants have now had a normal immune function for 11 months, and a third has made similar progress for four months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID, is a potentially lethal condition. It can be treated by bone marrow transplants, but French doctors from the Necker Hospital in Paris opted to try gene therapy, even though it has had generally unconvincing effects in other immune deficiency conditions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Science magazine reported how the doctors took bone marrow from the babies and selected blood stem cells, the cells that give rise to white blood cells. They infected them with a virus which had the gene lacked by the children gene attached to it. The virus carried the gene into the stem cells, which were then transplanted back into the babies. Within 15 days the team was able to find cells containing the inserted gene. They then gave the babies vaccinations and discovered that they produced the correct antibodies, impossible unless their immune systems had been repaired.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After treatment, the babies were able to leave protective isolation and return home. They are developing normally.

Gene therapy offers hope of heart disease cure.

By Nigel Hawkes science editor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
HEART disease experts are excited by a new study, which suggests that it may be possible to clear blocked arteries with an injection.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The blockages can cause heart attacks and it is thought that a simple method for removing them could, potentially, save thousands of lives.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A team at Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, the French drug company, and the Pasteur Institute injected mice, specially bred to develop heart disease, with the gene responsible for making a protein involved in transporting and clearing cholesterol from the body. In the animals' bloodstream, the gene made the protein, apolipoprotein E (apoE), which got to work. Within four days, changes were evident in the cholesterol levels of the mice and these changes persisted for at least five months in the mice given the largest doses of the gene.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
More remarkably, the fatty blockages in the arteries began to disappear. "Our first thought was to see if we could stop plaque development," Nicolas Duverger, of Rhone-Poulence Rorer, said, "but in fact we observed complete regression of the lesions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There were tremendous differences in the number of fatty deposits between our treated and untreated animals and we can say that there were almost zero fatty deposits in the blood vessels of the gene therapy group," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sir Charles George, medical director of the British Heart Foundation, said: "This research is very exciting. It suggests that apoE may have a profound effect in lowering blood cholesterol levels and in possibly reversing atherosclerosis [hardening of the arteries]. However, this research only demonstrated the effect in mice, so the application to humans is still unclear.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The British Heart Foundation is funding several studies researching the role of apoE, but even if research is positive, it could be at least ten years before the use of apoE is recommended for human beings."

Gene therapy brings new hope - Health.
</b>
</div><div class="author">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When I talk to people of my parents' generation or older they often comment on the remarkable rate of progress that has happened in medicine during their lifetime. When I talk to parents of children I am treating - children who often have chronic and incurable disorders - they voice their frustration that medical science seems to be moving so slowly. They ask when their child will be cured. How can there be such different perspectives?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Paediatrics did not exist as a medical speciality at the start of the century. Children were thought to be simply small adults, so their health needs were not seen as different. Most families would know of a child who had died, often in their own family. Nobody would have predicted that the average life expectancy for a woman today would be 79 years and for a man 74 years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As a doctor working in London then I would have seen infection as the main cause of illness and death in childhood, as it still is in many parts of the world. The top five children's diseases were gastrointestinal infections, smallpox, measles, diphtheria and scarlet fever. None of these would feature high on the list in the UK now. Gastrointestinal infections are still common, but treatable. Smallpox has been eradicated. Measles and diphtheria are rare, although keeping them that way is dependent on a high rate of immunisation. Scarlet fever, caused by streptococcal infection, has been controlled by the early use of antibiotics for bacterial throat infections.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today most families know nothing of serious illness or death among their children. But too many, unfortunately, still do. Of the five main causes of death in childhood today, injury is the most common, accounting for 37per cent of fatalities. It is hard to see what medical science can do to reduce injury: prevention is the key, rather than improvements in technology. Deaths from cancer (25 per cent) and birth defects (20 per cent), particularly of the nervous system, are also important.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Medical science already brings hope to some of these children. A boy recently returned to Great Ormond Street Hospital from Paris, where he was successfully treated with gene therapy for a rare immune deficiency. The genetics revolution will open up treatment possibilities that are only just imagined. It will lead to understanding not only of diseases in which there is a clear genetic defect, such as cystic fibrosis, but also those in which external factors can trigger the problem in a genetically susceptible individual. We all carry genetic defects so this is important for all of us and our unborn children.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Early next year the first draft of the human genetic code will be available through scientists working on the Human Genome Project. At first the information from this will be most useful for the diagnosis and better understanding of diseases. In time it should lead to genetic therapy and the possibility of manipulating the genome to cure diseases. Genetics has not always had a good press, especially this year, with concerns about genetically modified food. But the British Social Attitudes survey showed the public unambiguously supports genetic manipulation on clear medical grounds. Whether people will want to be tested for disorders that they or their children may develop in the future remains to be seen. Presumably that will depend on whether there is effective treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Our understanding of the development of the foetus will increase. In utero surgery has already been attempted, with varied results, but understanding what leads to birth defects will open up different options. Those of the nervous system are likely to be hardest to prevent or treat as we still know relatively little about how the brain works.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As we enter the next century we need to remember that infectious diseases still cause death and illness in childhood. They are conquered only when they are eradicated worldwide. It is easy to forget the benefits of immunisation when we have not seen the illnesses they prevent. With the ability to travel freely and the possibility of climate changes, new infectious diseases may be seen in the UK. Antibiotic resistance may challenge our ability to treat these, and others we now consider treatable.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Obesity will be one of the main chronic problems of childhood. What effect it will have on adult health is unclear, though it is known to play a role in the development of type 2 diabetes. Paediatricians are becoming aware of the long-term consequences of events in childhood on adult health and our understanding of this will increase.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new millennium brings hope for many families I know. Progress is being made at a heartening rate but seems frustratingly slow to those whose children are ill. We can acknowledge what has been achieved this century, but must also recognise what remains to be done.

Could gene therapy kill tumours? - Mind and Matter.
</b>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Trials have just started on women with ovarian and breast cancers. Anjana Ahuja reports
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Alan Kingsman, chief executive of Oxford BioMedica, ought to be feeling pleased with himself. His biotechnology company's first product - a gene therapy that appears to kill cancerous tumours - is about to go into clinical trials. If it works as well on human beings as it does on animals, there is the promise of great riches and the satisfaction of knowing that he has improved the lot of cancer patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But he does not buy into the euphoria. "A man is not a mouse," says Kingsman, who left his post as Professor of Biochemistry at Oxford University to set up the company three years ago. "What works in one won't necessarily work in the other. There is this notion that if a drug falls at clinical trials, the company is doomed. The public sees it as a failure and the City writes off the company. Developing drugs is a complex business. You throw as much science and knowledge at it as you can, but there are no absolutes."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The treatment about to be tested in cancer patients is designed to work alongside cyclophosphamide, a common anti-cancer drug. Cyclophosphamide becomes active only once it reaches the liver. An enzyme in the liver converts the inactive drug into a compound that kills rapidly dividing cells. After conversion, the toxic drug travels through the body to the tumour site, where it carries out its deadly work. But success comes at a price: once activated, the drug can destroy healthy cells as it journeys from the liver to the tumour. Also, because a lot of the active chemical is lost on the way to the tumour, high initial doses must be given.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists at Oxford BioMedica, which specialises in gene therapy, had a novel idea. The liver enzyme, which is called P450 and is crucial for activating the drug, is manufactured by a particular gene. Why not insert the gene straight into tumour cells? The gene would manufacture the enzyme within the tumour, triggering cyclophosphamide to become active only in cancerous cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So researchers developed a virus carrying the gene, capable of being injected directly into tumours. The virus would invade tumour cells and dump the P450 gene inside. Unlike other viruses, however, it would be engineered not to replicate, preventing it "leaking" from the tumour site. Instead of putting healthy cells at risk, this approach would target only enemy cells. "We hope to be able to reduce the dose but get a bigger therapeutic effect," Kingsman says. The therapy is about to be tested on a group of 20 women with breast and ovarian cancers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If successful, the therapy, called MetXia-P450, will still be several years away from cancer patients. Frustratingly, drug development is a long drawn-out affair. The first step is to test a prospective compound in living animal or human cells in the laboratory (in vitro). Ideally, the laboratory work should involve the target tissue, say cancer cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A compound that has a pro-mising effect on cells in a Petri dish may work differently in an entire organism. That is why animal testing is usually the next step. In vivo testing is an initial warning of both toxicity and efficacy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
These two stages are crucial to the drug's future development. The results are collated and presented to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), which oversees the licensing of drugs in Britain (in America it is the Food and Drug Administration), which then gives the go-ahead for tests on humans.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"You don't get anywhere near a human being without it being approved by the MCA," Kingsman says. "You have to present scientific evidence that there is a reasonable expectation that the drug works."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This may not mean that the drug is a potential cure; many drugs are designed to prolong life or improve its quality. This is a major target of drug companies, says Kingsman: "If we develop a drug that gives a father with a brain tumour an extra year with his child, then I am doing my job properly."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The MCA also checks whether drugs are of a sufficient quality to be tested on human beings. In some cases, therapies can be approved for human testing even if side-effects emerge during animal experiments - but the predicted benefits must outweigh the dangers. Companies involved in gene therapy must have their work approved by the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, which takes ethical issues into account.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Then comes a Phase I trial, which involves testing the therapy on healthy volunteers, to check if it is safe in human beings. Patients generally do not become involved until Phase II. Here, the drug will often be tested against another treatment, or a placebo, to determine which is more effective. Dosing is fine-tuned at this stage. Phase III, the final trial, can involve thousands of patients at different centres. This allows statistics to be gathered, which is vital in cases where the drug has a modest effect or where only a fraction of patients respond to it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, this format is not rigid - trials can be stopped early because results look pro-mising. It is then considered right to offer the therapy more widely. Some drugs, such as MetXia-P450, are tested on patients rather than healthy volunteers. This is the case with "hostile" therapies such as chemotherapy, which have nasty and sometimes dangerous side-effects. Once the trials are complete, the MCA decides whether the drug can be registered. Kingsman estimates that it takes almost a decade and tens of millions of pounds to reach that stage. The small biotech start-ups like Oxford BioMedica finance their research by doing deals with pharmaceutical giants, which pay vast sums to secure future licensing rights.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However coy Kingsman might be about his drug's prospects, he is optimistic that, a decade from now, our attitudes to cancer will change: "Completely eliminating cancer cells from a patient's body is a long way away. But I would stake my mortgage on there being dramatic new therapies in ten years' time."

GENE THERAPY PATIENTS SAVED FROM `TEST-TUBE EXISTENCE'.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
PATIENTS treated by gene therapy are no longer to be classified as genetically modified organisms, subject to special controls before being "released" into the environment. They had come under the same health and safety rules as plants and bacteria whose genes had been altered.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Volunteers taking part in the cystic fibrosis trial at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, for example, ought to have been reviewed to ensure they were safe to release. A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said: "If we had stuck to the letter of the law, we would have condemned these people to a test-tube existence."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The executive published proposals yesterday to exclude humans and human embryos from the category. "This is an example of how technological advances have outstripped the existing regulations," it says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The executive has also proposed a simplified system for classifying micro-organisms, such as bacteria, modified by genetic engineering. The system is designed to protect the public against the release of organisms that might cause damage or pass modified genes to other species.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new system classifies the organisms according to their potential harmfulness and will bring British regulations into line with a European Union directive due to come into force at the end of April. The proposals are now open to responses from interested parties.

GENE THERAPY TRIAL GIVES HOPE TO CYSTIC FIBROSIS SUFFERERS.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE search for a cure for cystic fibrosis, one of the commonest inherited diseases, has received a boost with a team of British doctors reporting a measure of success in repairing the gene defect in a group of patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The results are reported in the first issue of a new journal, Nature Medicine, and, although they are not a cure, they are very encouraging because they show that, in principle, faulty genes can be replaced by correctly functioning ones.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the trial, the correct genes were wrapped in fat particles called liposomes and sprayed into the noses of the patients. Tests showed that about a fifth of the normal functioning was restored to the cells lining the nose, which are similar to those of the lung. The effect wore off after a few days, but as a first attempt this can be regarded as a success.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The results were welcomed yesterday by the Cystic Fibrosis Trust and the Medical Research Council (MRC), which have both supported the research. For the trust, Dr Martin Scott called the results a significant step forward, while Dr Diane McLaren of the MRC said: "We're delighted to see such promising results. The findings are a major step towards the MRC's aim of developing treatments using gene therapy."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The work has been carried out by a team from the Royal Brompton Hospital, St Mary's Hospital Medical School, the MRC Human Genetics Unit in Edinburgh, and the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Pittsburgh. It is the biggest gene therapy trial for cystic fibrosis reported so far and involved 15 adult patients, nine of whom were given the gene and six who acted as controls.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In cystic fibrosis, a defect in a single gene on chromosome seven prevents sufferers from making a protein vital in controlling the flow of chloride ions across the cell membrane. The effect is principally felt in the lungs, causing them to fill with thick mucus and making them prone to infection. There are about 6,000 sufferers in Britain, and while treatments have greatly improved their chances, their life expectancy remains low.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gene defect was identified in 1989, creating the opportunity of gene therapy. In America, researchers have used a disabled version of a virus to carry the gene into the cells. The British team has chosen to use liposomes, fats that are very similar to the material making up the cell membrane. When such particles come into contact with cells, they merge with them like two soap bubbles.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The British patients showed no ill-effects from the liposome spray, unlike the American trial, which had to be curtailed when one patient developed an infection. The drawback to liposomes, as Dr Ron Crystal of the US National Institutes of Health points out in an editorial in Nature Medicine, is that they do not carry the corrected gene right into the nucleus of the cell where it is needed. This means that most of the DNA is wasted, necessitating frequent doses, he believes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The trial indeed shows that the effect was relatively transient, peaking after three days and then declining. Further studies must be designed to improve the efficiency of gene delivery, according to the authors of the study, led by Dr Natasha Caplen of St Mary's. Although the researchers describe the results as "encouraging", they say that better delivery and a more long-lived effect will be needed if the technique is to be effective clinically.

GENE THERAPY OFFERS HOPE OF CURING LUNG DISEASE - DR DUNCAN GEDDES.
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Nigel Hawkes, Science Editor.
</div><div>599 words</div><div>7 September 1994</div><div>The Times</div><div>T</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 1994</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A REVOLUTIONARY treatment for cystic fibrosis has produced encouraging results in its first human trials, raising hopes that an effective treatment for the disease may be available within five years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr Duncan Geddes of the Royal Brompton Hospital in London told the British Association conference in Loughborough yesterday that a small trial of gene therapy in 15 patients had produced a 20% correction of the gene defect responsible for the disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While that was probably not quite good enough for use on patients, he said, he expected that a better treatment would be available by the time they were ready to go to full-scale trials, which were expected to start in about 18 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defect in a single gene and is one of the commonest genetic disorders, leading to early death. About 5,000 people in Britain suffer from the condition.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The defective gene means that cells in the lung cannot transport salt and water properly, the surface of the airways dries out and lung damage follows. Once, cystic fibrosis sufferers would die before the age of five. Today better treatments have greatly prolonged life expectancy but few live much beyond their thirtieth birthday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Two trials in the United States have used viruses to carry the correct gene into the lungs, but in one of them a patient became seriously ill as a result of a viral infection. The method used at the Brompton is to surround the gene in liposomes, the fatty materials that make up the cell membranes. "We believee that this method may be safer," Dr Geddes said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gene, wrapped in its liposome package, has so far been tried only on the cells of the nose, which are similar to those of the lung. By measuring electrical charges inside the nose, and examining cells from the nose, it is possible to estimate how much of the gene has been incorporated and whether it is correcting the defect.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr Geddes yesterday declined to give details of the results, which are awaiting publication. But the printed version of his talk said: "The results were encouraging and showed approximately 20% correction of the gene defect."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because the therapy was applied only to nose cells, it had no effect on the condition of the patients who volunteered for the trial. But Dr Geddes was confident that the therapy would work, opening the way to the treatment of many more genetic diseases and a new chapter in clinical medicine. "We're about 20% of the way there, so we've still got 80% of the way to go, but we will get there," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Gene therapy research has provided its full share of excitement, nail-biting and frustration to our team. We all remain convinced that gene therapy will work and provide real benefits to people with cystic fibrosis."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Professor Bob Williamson of St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, a geneticist who is part of the trial team, said that the results had shown that gene therapy using liposomes was safe.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He added that large-scale trials would begin in 18 months and that he expected clinical use of the technique within four to five years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even if successful, the therapy will not eliminate the disease, because rules forbid tampering with genes that can be passed on to children. Carriers of the gene will continue to pass it on to their offspring but the therapy should enable those with the condition to live longer and healthier lives.

DOCTORS START GENE THERAPY TREATMENT FOR CYSTIC FIBROSIS.
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Nigel Hawkes, Science Editor.
</div><div>547 words</div><div>26 August 1993</div><div>The Times</div><div>T</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright Times Newspapers Ltd, 1993</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first British trial of a revolutionary new treatment for cystic fibrosis begins today at the Royal Brompton Hospital in London.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Six volunteers who inherited a faulty gene from their parents will be given the correct gene in the form of a spray into their noses and lungs. The hope is that it will put right the defect that causes their lungs to fill with thick mucus, making them prone to infection.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
About two million people carry the genetic defect, but it produces symptoms only when children inherit the faulty gene from both parents. Improved treatments have increased survival rates, but sufferers there are about 6,000 in Britain generally die in their 20s. The isolation of the gene responsible by researchers in Toronto in 1989 opened the way for the treatment, a landmark in the application of new genetic knowledge. The gene, which lies on chromosome 7, is responsible for producing a protein called Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulating factor (CFTR) which controls the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A child with the faulty gene in both copies of chromosome 7 is unable to produce the protein, causing an imbalance in the cells of the airways in the lung.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The trial will be conducted by the Brompton's specialist cystic fibrosis unit, under Dr Duncan Geddes and Dr Margaret Hodson, in collaboration with Professor Bob Williamson at St Mary's Hospital Medical School, and Dr David Porteous and Dr Julia Dorin of the Medical Research Council's human genetics unit in Edinburgh.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The spray will be a mixture of genes and fat particles called liposomes. To begin with, the mixture will be sprayed into the nose, whose cells are similar to those of the lung. If all goes well, the airways of the lungs will also be treated.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The fatty liposome particles are similar to the material that makes up the cell membrane, or wall, and will merge with the cells "like two soap bubbles coming together", Professor Williamson says. The process should insert the gene into the cells, where it will produce the missing protein.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Six men will be given the gene therapy while another three are given inactive liposomes to act as controls. Progress will be monitored using nasal electrical measurements developed by Dr Eric Alton of the Royal Brompton. Only Dr Hodson will know which patients are getting active treatment and which are controls. She will stop the trial if any ill-effects are seen.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One of the volunteers, Darren Keen, a 23-year caterer from Hemel Hempstead, Hertfordshire, said yesterday that he was just pleased to be able to help. "I've been assured there are no risks, and I know it isn't a cure," he said. He needs physiotherapy twice a day, and takes "about 70 tablets" every day to control the course of the disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr Geddes believes gene therapy may be more effective, though it cannot reverse the damage already done. The first results of the trial are expected in November and if they are good a bigger trial will start. If successful, the technique could become a mainstream therapy in about five years and herald a new era of treatment of inherited diseases.

A weapon to change the world - Gene therapy - Body and Mind.
</b>
</div><div class="author">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first proposal in Britain to use gene therapy against cancer, announced at the weekend by the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF), is a landmark in medicine. For the first time the public can glimpse the huge potential power over disease that molecular biology has made possible.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Understanding the genes that control the body makes it possible to home in on cancer cells and leave healthy cells undamaged. The superbly-detailed machinery of the cell can be used by doctors to support their efforts and not frustrate them. Instead of using a blunderbuss, lethal to both healthy and diseased cells, they can employ a rapier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The ICRF plan, still to be approved by the Clothier Committee which governs gene therapy, aims at the fastest-growing cancer in the Western world, malignant melanoma. The growth of this cancer is a result of the taste for sunbathing, which can induce changes in the cells that lie just below the skin and produce the pigment melanin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Caught early, melanoma can be treated successfully by surgery. But of the 3,300 or so people who develop the disease in the United Kingdom every year, more than a third will die. The disease is more common in women than in men, and occurs in younger age groups than other types of cancer. In Australia and New Zealand it is the commonest cancer among young adults.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The ICRF scientists have identified a specific feature in the melanin-producing cells that enables them to be targeted. An enzyme called tyrosinase, produced by the cells, is vital in the production of melanin. This enzyme, in turn, is produced in the cells by the action of a short length of the genetic material DNA, called a promoter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Every cell in the body contains the same piece of DNA, but only in the melanin-producing cells is it switched on. For some reason, still not fully understood, cells have the ability to pick and choose which among their huge repertoire of genes they will decide to use. This particular promoter gene is turned on only in the cells that produce the pigments in the skin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For this reason, it provides the key which gives easy entry into those cells. Using genetic engineering, the ICRF scientists have linked the promoter gene to a second gene, the function of which is to turn cells blue. The idea is to demonstrate that the promoter gene can get into the cell, and switch on any other gene to which it is attached. In experiments using mice, reported yesterday in Cancer Research, Richard Vile and Ian Hart from the ICRF laboratory in Lincoln's Inn Fields, London, have shown that the melanin-producing cells are indeed turned blue.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This, of course, is merely a demonstration that the method works. In actual therapy, the blue gene will be replaced by the gene for a naturally occurring substance called interleukin 2, which is known to have anti-cancer properties. In earlier trials, interleukin 2 has been injected directly into patients with melanoma, and has shown some useful effects. The trouble has been that it damages healthy and tumour cells alike, so that in doses large enough to knock out the tumour it has serious side-effects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By linking the gene for interleukin 2 to the promoter gene, the ICRF scientists will ensure that it is turned on only in the melanin-producing cells, not elsewhere. Interleukin 2 does not kill the cells directly, but stimulates the immune response to recognise cancer cells and reject them. This should mean that healthy melanin-producing cells are not damaged.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The design of the therapy thus involves two types of selectivity: firstly, only the melanin-producing cells will produce the interleukin 2, and secondly, only those that are cancerous will be recognised as such and attacked by the immune system. If all goes well, the tumour cells should be killed and the rest left alone. Better still, the large production of interleukin 2 by the cancer cells should stimulate the whole immune system against secondary cancers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To deliver the gene to the tumours, the team has found that the most obvious method of all direct injection seems to work well. In many proposed gene therapies, "vectors" such as viruses are being used to insinuate the gene into the cells, but Drs Vile and Hart have found that injecting the DNA into the tumours on the skin is enough. Somehow it finds its way through the cell wall into individual cells, where it begins to work. In principle, there seems no reason why the direct injection method should not be used for internal tumours.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If approval is given, the trials could begin on volunteers by the end of this year. Professor Adrian Harris, of the ICRF's Clinical Oncology Laboratory at Oxford, is optimistic that the method will work in a technical sense, as the mouse experiments have been so successful. But will it actually kill the cancer? "We believe so, or we wouldn't be applying to the Clothier Committee," he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Therapie
s against other cancers might be designed using the same principles, he believes. For example, some cancers have the ability to disguise themselves from the immune system by retracting the receptors on their cell surfaces that would otherwise make them distinguishable. "We could introduce a gene that would force them to identify themselves, so that the immune system could see them and destroy them," he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He emphasises that lengthy proving trials and safety tests will have to be carried out, so that it is likely, even if all goes well, to be ten years before the therapy can come into general use.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In America, a cancer therapy using the interleukin 2 gene has been tried on a desperately ill woman with a brain tumour. Doctors at the San Diego Regional Cancer Center were given permission for the therapy on compassionate grounds. It involves removing the woman's cells, inserting into them the interleukin 2 gene, and then replacing them in the bloodstream. The hope is that the effect will be to stimulate greater production of the foreign-cell killing T cells in the woman's body. Circulating in the blood, they will reach the brain and attack the cancer. No results have yet been reported for this trial, which is cruder in design than the ICRF method.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
What other common diseases might be treated by gene therapy? When it was first mooted, the idea was that its principal use would be to correct the genetic errors, caused by heredity or spontaneous mutation, which lie behind such diseases as muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now, trials are in hand or are planned for several such diseases, with the first British therapy to be approved aimed at a rare condition called adenosine deaminase deficiency, caused by a missing gene. The disease leaves victims without an effective immune system. A girl at Great Ormond Street Hospital, in London, will be treated by having bone marrow cells removed, treated to replace the missing gene whose task it is to produce the enzyme adenosine deaminase, and then replaced in her body. If successful, the cells will be able to produce the missing enzyme, without which the immune system cannot function. Gene therapy trials on two children in America, using roughly the same method, have produced encouraging results.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There are thousands of such conditions, and the genes responsible for them are being identified at an increasing rate, so the prospects for gene therapy are constantly widening. The Clothier Committee is considering an application from St Mary's Hospital, Paddington, west London, to use a mist of fat particles inhaled into the lungs to carry the corrected gene to where it is needed in cystic fibrosis patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In America, applications of the method are mutiplying so fast it is difficult to keep up. There are at least 37 proposed gene therapy experiments either approved or in the pipeline.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An even bigger potential benefit, however, lies in diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, where the cause may be only partially genetic but where the ability to alter brain cells might bring huge dividends.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Three papers published in the February issue of the journal Nature Genetics give a hint of what might be achieved. The same "blue" gene as used by the ICRF scientists has been attached to a virus vector, and injected directly into mice brains. The resulting blue colour of the brain cells shows that this method can be used to introduce genes into brain cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One possible use might be in stroke patients. The idea would be to reduce the effects of a stroke by introducing substances designed to minimise tissue damage to the brain. Alternatively, the technique might be used to try to correct the damage caused by degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's, or to target drugs directly at brain tumours. At present, these ideas are a long way from application. What is already clear, however, is that the range of potential applications for gene therapy is huge. The chances are that some disappointments lie ahead in medical research things seldom work as well as their originators hope but the prospects are exciting. A revolution in medical treatment could be at hand.

Doctors plan first gene therapy trial.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
BRITAIN'S first gene therapy trial will take place within the next few weeks at Great Ormond Street hospital, London.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patient is a child suffering from a congenital condition in which the body is unable to make a vital enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA). In the absence of the enzyme, toxic substances accumulate in the bloodstream and kill the lymphocytes, cells vital to the functioning of the immune system. Sufferers are vulnerable to infections and usually die in childhood.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A team led by Dr Gareth Morgan, senior lecturer in immunology at the hospital, will carry out the therapy, for which approval was given on Tuesday by a government advisory committee chaired by Sir Cecil Clothier. The patient has not been named.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The treatment will involve removing bone marrow cells, modifying them in the laboratory by inserting into their genetic material the missing ADA gene, and replacing them. That should enable the patient to produce the enzyme and allow the immune system to recover. Finally, the modified cells will be replaced in the bloodstream, to find their own way back to the bone marrow.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr Morgan said yesterday that the Clothier committee had approved a protocol for treating a specific patient. Doctors hope that the single treatment will have long-lasting effects, unlike the American experiments which altered blood cells only and needed to be repeated monthly.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The success of the American therapy the two children are doing well more than two years after they were first treated has provided great encouragement to those involved in gene therapy. But the total of ADA patients is small, probably no more than 40-50 in the world.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The full benefit of gene therapy will come only when it is applied to more common genetic diseases such as cystic fibrosis. A proposal to treat such patients has been made but has yet to be approved.

The first attempt to treat Aids by gene therapy has been given approval by the US Food and Drug Administration's vaccine advisory committee. The biotechnology company Viagene Inc proposes to remove immature skin cells called fibroblasts from HIV-infected patients and place them in a laboratory dish. A virus will then be used to carry a gene coding for an HIV "envelope" protein into the cells and they will be injected back into a patient's body. It is hoped the procedure will trigger an immune response that will wipe out HIV-infected cells while leaving non-infected cells unharmed.

Gene Therapy halts cancer in rats.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy, the latest treatment for a wide range of conditions from Aids to cancer, has received a boost from results published in this week's issue of Science.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
American scientists have shown that in rats a normally lethal brain cancer can be stopped by the use of gene therapy. They hope to be given approval to begin clinical trials on human patients by the end of the summer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One of the scientists responsible, Kenneth Culver of the National Cancer Institute, is also involved in the successful use of gene therapy to treat two girls with an enzyme deficiency. Almost two years after approval was given for that treatment, the girls are well, receiving injections of their own cells which have been genetically altered to make them produce the missing enzyme.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The cancer treatment operates differently, with Dr Culver and Edward Oldfield adding the gene of the herpes virus to the tumour cells. That makes the cells susceptible to anti-herpes drugs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The method involves inserting into a culture of mouse cells the gene of a virus known to be sensitive to ganciclovir, the anti-herpes drug. The mouse cells are then injected directly into the tumours in the brains of the rats. Once there, the virus spreads through the cells that are dividing and growing. In the brain, the only cells that do that are tumour cells, so this ensures that the virus genes end up only in cancer cells and not in normal ones.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A week later, after the genes had spread, the rats were given ten injections of ganciclovir over five days. In 11 of the rats, all the cancer cells died, although the virus gene was present in only 60% of them.

Recent progress in genetic science may lead to a reduction in disease, reports Nigel Hawkes
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The advance of genetic knowledge is in danger of telling us more about ourselves then we really want to know.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hardly a week passes without a new discovery. Last week it was the turn of asthma, with the news from Oxford that an asthma gene may be close to identification. Before that, scientists declared that they were pursuing the "Churchill gene" the magic ingredient which, it is surmised, enabled Winston Churchill to survive to a great age in spite of disregarding virtually every rule of healthy living.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Thousands of diseases, ranging from the relatively trivial to the life-threatening, are genetically determined. Some are caused by a single faulty gene out of the 100,000 we all carry; others, like cancer or heart disease, are obviously more complex. Some genetic defects are sufficient in themselves to cause diseases, while others only increase the susceptibility to disease. Everyone carries several gene defects which are potentially very damaging; whether they come to light or not depends on whom you marry, and on your lifestyle.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If a carrier marries another carrier, their children may suffer the full-blown condition. In more complex diseases where inheritance is only part of the picture, a healthy lifestyle may mean that the defect is never given the chance to express itself. The evidence is strong that there is a genetic component in diseases like breast or colon cancer, but it is probably the result of several genes rather than just one, and not everybody carrying those genes will develop the diseases. Environment, diet and other factors are equally or more important in these cases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first result of the discoveries is to make screening for disease, or susceptibility to disease, much easier. It is possible to screen for cystic fibrosis, for example, by analysing cells from the inner lining of the cheeks, collected by spitting a mouthwash into a test-tube. In the future such simple tests may tell us our chances of contracting, or avoiding, a whole range of conditions in which inheritance plays a part.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sir David Weatherall, professor of medicine at Oxford University, envisages a future in which we shall all "live by our genes", tailoring our lifestyle to the hand our own particular genes have dealt us. Of course, if we are unlucky enough to inherit the genes for classic genetic diseases like Huntington's chorea, which leads to dementia and death in middle age, there may be little that changing lifestyle can do to help. The situation is different for diseases that are only partly genetic in orgin. Anybody carrying the genes that predispose to cancer or heart disease would be counselled to conform to the rules of healthy eating, while an individual whose genes made them sensitive to hydrocarbons would be well advised not to work in a refinery. If allowed to, insurance companies might use the results of screening to set premiums or to deny cover to poor risks.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sir Walter Bodmer, director of the Imperial Cancer Research Fund and president of the Human Genome Mapping Organisation, is in no doubt that the tests will have a huge impact on medicine and on the way we lead our lives. "This is the preventive medicine of the future," he says. As an xample, he cites the planned trial of a drug, tamoxifen, which many specialists believe could be effective in preventing as well as treating breast cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sir Walter says: "At present, women are to be selected for the trial if members of their family have suffered from breast cancer a mother, a sister, an aunt. Obviously it would be much better if we could find specific genetic markers, which would give a stronger indication. Other examples are in bowel cancer and heart disease, and, further off, in mental illnesses like Alzheimer's, depression and schizophrenia."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Professor Bob Williamson of St Mary's Hospital Medical School in London sees screening as a way of giving people their own personalised healthy living plan. He says: "At the moment, there's simply too much advice about, so people ignore it. But if we can say, look, you are at particular risk of heart disease, you had better take some notice, then people may be prepared to listen."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The way screening is carried out, and its accuracy, is likely to be critical. In the 1970s a screening system for the genetic disease sickle cell anaemia was introduced in the US, but went badly wrong. There was unfair discrimination against healthy people who could no longer get jobs or insurance.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Trials organised by the Medical Research Council and the Cystic Fibrosis Research Trust are trying to find out the best way of screening. Dr Tony Jackson, chairmn of thust's Research and Medical Advisory Committee, says: "If we can tell people they are definitely not carriers or that they definitely are, then that's fine. But there are some, about 15%, where we have to
give them a statistical probability, and that sets up anxieties. They don't know what to do."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The issue will be even more important for diseases in which the genetic cause is less clear-cut. Women who discover they are carriers of the gene for diseases like thalassaemia or cystic fibrosis are usually delighted to be told, because it enables them to have the choice of an abortion if their children will turn out to have the condition. But a genetic test that indicated, for example, a one in five chance of a child suffering from schizophrenia might simply create anxiety.

Professor Williamson says that for diseases that are well-understood, this danger is much smaller. Studies of French Canadians by Dr Anna Kessling, a colleague of his at St Mary's, have already shown clear genetic differences between those at high and low risk of heart disease. The French Canadians are a special case, because they derive from a relatively small stock and have a narrow range of genetic variation. But Professor Williamson believes that for common diseases like cancer of the colon, effective screening of the more heterogenous British population may not be far away.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Screening will be given a great boost if attempts to repair genetic defects are successful. Then there will be a clear benefit to set against the fear that genetic knowledge will be used to deny jobs or health insurance. Already parents with children suffering from diseases like cystic fibrosis are anxiously calculating whether gene therapy can come quickly enough to save their children.

Hopes rise on GENE THERAPY FOR blood disease - Haemophilia B.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some of the first Britons to undergo gene therapy, given government approval last week, could be those with haemophilia B, a rare inherited disease that inhibits blood clotting. The treatment replaces missing or defective genes with healthy ones.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An agreement between Genetic Therapy, an American biotechnology company, and the British Technology Group in London, which supports and licenses research world-wide, gives the US firm the rights to research from teams at Oxford and Washington universities. They recently located the gene that controls production of factor IX, a blood protein, and unravelled its structure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
People with haemophilia B about 15% of haemophiliacs either produce too little or none of the protein because the vital gene is defective or missing. They can suffer uncontrolled bleeding if cut or bruised, and bleeding around the joints even after light exercise. At present they have to take transfusions of factor IX, made from concentrated human blood donations, which puts them at risk of diseases including Aids and herpes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy offers the chance of the missing factor being produced continuously, overcoming the problem of bleeding joints.

The first patient treated by gene therapy is making good progress, according to an American research worker.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patient, a girl aged four, is being treated for a genetic deficiency that destroys the body's ability to fight infections. Five months after therapy began she is showing improved immune function, Michael Blaese told the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The girl was born without the gene responsible for producing an enzyme called adenosine deaminase (ADA). Without ADA, toxins build up in the bloodstream, killing the cells that otherwise would fight infections. ADA deficient children are constantly ill; most die by the age of two.

Government backs human gene therapy tests.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first human tests of gene therapy, a technique that experts believe could prove as revolutionary as organ transplants did in the 1960s have been approved by an American government panel.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Countering fears that the therapy could lead to genetic tinkering in an attempt to improve the human race, doctors and scientists say it could eventually open a whole new area in medical treatment with the potential to cure many hereditary diseases, cancer and even Aids.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This is a truly historic moment," said Gerard McGarrity, president of the Coriell Institute for Medical Research and chairman of the expert advisory panel of the Washington-based National Institutes of Health, which has approved two specific gene therapy experiments on humans. "Medicine has been waiting for this kind of therapy for thousands of years."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
French Anderson, one of the technique's pioneers at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said: "This is the first step for what will almost certainly be a revolution in medical treatment... Over the next five to ten years it is likely that a broad range of serious diseases will be treated by gene therapy." Scientists have traced a number of inherited disorders, including haemophilia and cystic fibrosis, to malfunctions by genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The aim of gene therapy is to replace missing genes or enhance the performance of those that already exist. This generally involves removing immune-system cells from the patient, "splicing" specific genes into them and infusing them back into the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One of the experiments approved by the so-called Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee will be conducted on up to ten children suffering from a rare and devastating congenital immune-system defect, known as adenosine deaminase deficiency, or ADA. The other will attempt to treat up to 50 victims of metastatic melanoma, a fatal skin cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nobody knows for sure whether gene therapy will work, or what the risks are in tampering with the body's genetic mechanism. Steven Rosenberg, of the National Cancer Institute, told the committee that the gene he intended to use on the melanoma patients had been "almost miraculous" in reducing tumours on mice, but had been an "abysmal failure" when injected intravenously into humans.

John Newell
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Human gene therapy has been given provisional approval and an experiment should take place this year. It will demonstrate a possible cure for a disease caused by a defective gene by replacing it with a donated healthy version.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The American National Institutes of Health has approved a gene therapy proposal for treating children born with the rare disease known as the "bubble baby syndrome". These children have no natural defence against infection and must live in a sterile environment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There are other disorders of the immune system, in which a defective gene stops some of the white blood cells which normally protect us against disease from working properly, that are expected to become the next candidates.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If successful, the group of blood disorders such as haemophilia and thalassaemia anaemia caused by genetic defects are likely to be tackled by gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The scope for gene therapy has widened so much that scientists now are researching ways to use it to prevent or to treat diseases, including coronary heart disease and cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Genes have been shifted routinely from one living organism to another for years. Human genes shifted into laboratory cell cultures are being used to make the substances that protect our bodies against disease outside the body for use as medical drugs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Genes are being moved from one species of plant to another, or even from bacteria or fungi into plants, to give crops valuable properties such as resistance to disease or to herbicides which could not be provided by conventional plant breeding.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Transgenic" sheep have been bred with human genes added to make the sheep produce valuable substances, such as the clotting factors needed to treat haemophilia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But human gene therapy the development that excites and sometimes frightens people most of all is still to come. At a recent London meeting of scientists, Professor Richard Mulligan, of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, an acknowledged leader in gene therapy development, says it will first be used to treat immune system disorders caused by genetic defects. These disorders are incurable and often fatal and the technology needed for their treatment has already been developed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Such conditions are sometimes treated by killing the patient's own bone marrow, the tissue where the white cells are made, using radiation or toxic chemicals, and transplanting healthy bone marrow from a related donor into the patient to produce healthy white blood cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy for such conditions will be performed by taking a sample of the patient's own bone marrow, growing it in the laboratory and infecting the bone marrow with a virus called a retrovirus which naturally inserts its own genes into the cell it infects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The retrovirus used will be rendered harmless by removing some of its genes and inserting in their place the correct version of the gene which is defective in the human patient.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After being infected in this way with the wanted gene, the bone marrow will be grown in culture and then reimplanted in the patient. The hope is that it will supply enough healthy, normal white blood cells to cure the condition.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prof Mulligan says he expects to see such techniques being used for the first time within three years and making a major medical impact in 10 or 15 years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All the techniques required have already been tested in mice. After bone marrow, the next target for gene therapy is the liver. Defective genes in liver cells cause several common diseases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prof Mulligan's team has shown that by inserting the correct version of the gene into only 5 per cent of the cells of the liver of a rabbit affected by hypercholesterolaemia very high levels of blood cholesterol causing hardening of the arteries and coronary heart diseases it is possible to lower blood cholesterol levels by 30 per cent. Research is now showing that it will not always be necessary to put the wanted genes into the part of the body affected by a disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Professor Howard Green, of the Harvard Medical School, is planning to treat dwarfism, caused by a deficiency of the growth hormone normally produced by the pituitary gland, by implanting genes for growth hormones into skin grafts. The plan is to remove a small sample of skin cells from the patient and to insert the growth hormone gene into them using a retrovirus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Then the cells will be grown in tissue culture until there are enough of them to provide a sizeable sheet of skin. This will then be grafted on to the patient and hopefully will supply the missing growth hormone by diffusion down into blood vessels below the surface of the skin. Donor skin cannot be used because of rejection problems.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As well as treating many of the 2,000 diseases caused by signal genetic defects, which affect about 5 per cent of people, gene therapy may eventually become the preferred means of treating and preventing forms of
cancer and heart disease. It could happen within our children's lifetimes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But is it safe? Prof Mulligan has carried out tests and believes there is no risk that retroviruses used to carry new genes into cells might cause infectious diseases or cancer. Another concern is that such viruses might trigger the effects of oncogenes, the genes which can cause cancer if they are stimulated to act in the wrong place or at the wrong time.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
No sign of any such effects has been seen in 2,000 test tube experiments, but more precautions are still needed.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Prof Mulligan and others point out that the risks of gene therapy, when it is first used to treat fatal and incurable diseases, will certainly be less than those of other treatments when they were used for incurable cancers for the first time.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Government has formed a committee to investigate the ethics of gene therapy, which, advisers to the Department of Health believe, will lead to a treatment for certain inherited illnesses within three years. It intends to establish ethical guidelines before trials of a radical form of treatment begin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, Minister for Health, said that gene therapy would be permitted only for children and adults with a genetic defect. There was no question of allowing the replacement of genes in germ cells or embryos during in-vitro fertilization or test tube baby births.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A group of peers will seek to persuade the House of Lords next week to keep silent on the issue of abortion during their debates on the embryo research legislation (Sheila Gunn writes). Instead, they will urge the Government to give parliamentary time to a private peer's Bill dealing solely with the legal restrictions on abortions.
