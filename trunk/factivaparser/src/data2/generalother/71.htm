</div><div class="author">By Amy Dockser Marcus </div><div>1026 words</div><div>7 July 2010</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2010, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers have launched a new gene-therapy trial for children with a rare disease known as "bubble boy syndrome," reflecting fresh hopes that the strategy of delivering working genes can be used to treat many intractable ailments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new study, sponsored in the U.S. by investigators at Children's Hospital Boston and expected to open at five sites around the world, scientists plan to enroll 20 boys with SCID-X1, which stands for severe combined immunodeficiency, X-linked -- a genetic condition that affects boys and leaves them unable to fight germs. Without treatment, which is currently possible only by bone-marrow transplantation, most children die before age one.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study comes seven years after two similar trials in Europe -- one in Paris and one in London, involving a total of 20 children -- were temporarily halted when two participants were diagnosed with leukemia. Three others eventually developed the blood cancer, and one died. Those who survived were cured of SCID-X1, but the episode prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to put a hold on certain gene-therapy studies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While gene-therapy studies in other diseases have since gone forward, the new trial is the first involving SCID-X1 to take place in the U.S. since the hold was imposed. Researchers believe they have stripped out the feature of the treatment that caused leukemia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If the trial is successful, we think what we are doing can apply to other rare diseases as well," said David Williams, chief of hematology/oncology at Children's Hospital Boston and lead investigator for the U.S. sites.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In gene therapy, scientists try to correct a problem caused by a defective or non-functioning gene. A normal gene is delivered via what scientists call a vector, typically a virus genetically altered to contain human DNA. The idea is that this normal gene will begin producing a protein that has been missing or not working and cure the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The earlier SCID-X1 trials, along with the death in 1999 of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger four days after starting gene therapy at the University of Pennsylvania for a different genetic condition, intensified regulatory scrutiny and dampened enthusiasm for the new technology. Some scientists began to wonder whether gene therapy was too risky and too complex to become a safe and effective treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But recent findings from several studies are rekindling excitement for the approach. Last fall, a team led by researchers at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine reported they had successfully injected a gene via a genetically engineered vector into the retinas of 12 patients suffering from a blindness-causing genetic disease called Leber's congenital amaurosis. All patients had some improvement in eyesight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In another report last year, European researchers said they successfully delivered a gene into the blood cells of two patients with a rare, fatal brain disease called X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), the disease featured in the movie "Lorenzo's Oil." Patrick Aubourg, professor of pediatrics at University Paris Descartes, said the treatment halted progression of the disease. Three years later, the patients remain stable and can attend school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary findings helped Genetix Pharmaceuticals Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., raise $35 million in venture capital to finance additional research, said Nick Leschly, the company's interim president.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The data in these and other reports involve small numbers of patients, but "we're seeing the first evidence of real therapeutic efficacy," said Susan Robinson, chief executive officer of Seattle-based <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics Corp</span>., which is involved in an ongoing gene-therapy trial in Britain for Leber's congenital amaurosis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new SCID-X1 trial -- which is open in London and Boston and undergoing regulatory review in Los Angeles, Cincinnati and Paris -- researchers will take stem cells from a patient's own bone marrow, deliver a functioning gene into those cells in the lab and then infuse them back into the patient. If all goes well, the cells will start producing a protein that will multiply and provide a functioning immune system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, SCID-X1 is treatable only by bone-marrow transplantation, preferably from a sibling who is an exact bone-marrow match. When successful, that halts progression of the disease. But patients who must resort to marrow from unmatched donors require chemotherapy and face other serious complications.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So gene therapy, if successful, could not only avoid the need for chemotherapy but correct the genetic defect in one treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The possibility of curing a disease possibly forever after only one treatment is really amazing," says Dr. Williams of Children's Hospital Boston.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Williams wasn't involved in the original trial, but helped found the Transatlantic Gene Therapy Consortium seven years ago to set a new course for SCID-X1 trials following the leukemia problems. The group -- including researchers from the UCL Institute of Child Health in London, Necker Hospital in Paris and Hannover Medical School in Germany -- has vetted data, devised new laboratory experiments and redesigned the vehicle delivering the normal gene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As part of the redesign, the parts of the vector thought to have activated leukemia-causing genes have been taken out. The researchers successfully tested the new vector in animals and in lab studies and believe that the problem has been eliminated, says Luigi Notarangelo, the site investigator for the trial at Children's Hospital Boston. Study participants will be monitored for 15 years to rule out any cancer risk.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disease is very rare -- fewer than one in 200,000 babies are born with the X-linked version of SCID each year -- so the consortium adopted a common protocol in order to try to enroll patients more quickly.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meantime, St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Memphis, Tenn., is planning a separate gene-therapy trial for infants with SCID-X1. The St. Jude's researchers developed their own viral vector they say will lower the risk of leukemia. The investigators are hoping to begin enrollment in late 2010 or early 2011, a spokeswoman said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A small study showed that a form of gene therapy significantly improved the vision of patients left legally blind by a rare genetic eye disease. The benefit was especially striking among children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers said the findings amount to an important advance toward medicine's ambitious but generally unrealized dream of replacing disease-causing mutant or missing genes with normal DNA to treat and cure debilitating illnesses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study, 12 patients, including four children between ages 8 and 11 years old, underwent a surgical procedure in which a gene that makes a protein critical to vision function was injected into one eye. The second eye wasn't treated. While normal sight wasn't restored in any of the patients, all reported some improvement. Six gained enough vision that they may no longer meet criteria for being legally blind, researchers said, including the four children for whom substantial recovery of vision appears to have transformed their lives.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The children "were using Braille" in school before they were treated with the gene therapy, said Katherine A. High, co-lead investigator for the study. "Now they're reading books."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. High is director of the center for cellular and molecular therapeutics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, the main sponsor of the study. She and colleagues from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine are presenting the results at a meeting of the American Academy of Ophthalmology in San Francisco. The study was published online Saturday by the medical journal the Lancet.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Much more needs to be learned about the safety of the treatment, its durability and other factors. But so far, improvement in vision has persisted as long as two years after a single treatment without evidence of significant adverse side effects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One of the long-term goals of gene therapy is to develop medicines you can take off the shelf and inject into a patient -- medicine in a bottle," said Dr. High, who is also a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator. "This is an example of where that has worked. That's a big step forward for the field." Technical challenges and safety concerns have hampered gene-therapy efforts in recent years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients in the study suffered from a condition called Leber's congenital amaurosis. It is marked by a mutation in a gene known as RPE65. This results in a missing enzyme that leads to degradation of the retina and the disruption of vision processing in the brain. About 3,000 Americans are affected, of whom between 6% and 16% have the type of disease that affects patients in the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients have significant visual impairment beginning in infancy. The disease progresses slowly, and most of those who have it are totally blind by their 30s or early 40s. There are no effective treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jean Bennett, professor of ophthalmology at University of Pennsylvania and senior author of the study, and her husband, Albert M. McGuire, an eye surgeon at the university, developed the treatment over two decades of research. Dr. McGuire, co-lead author of the study, performed the procedure to inject the gene therapy under the retina in all of the patients in the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Corey Haas, now 9, is one participant who benefited markedly from the procedure. Before he was treated 13 months ago, he sat in the back of the class at school with a large computer screen and a teacher's aide to help him see class materials. Now he sits at the front of the class and can see the chalk board and other content without the assistance of a computer or an aide. Another boy, from Belgium, needed a teacher to run with him in races during school field days to stay on the course. He always finished last, Dr. High said. After the gene therapy, he ran the course on his own and finished fifth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another step is to treat both eyes in afflicted patients. Every patient in the study has asked for the procedure on their other eye, something researchers say is possible when they gain more confidence about the treatment's safety.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ethan Haas, Corey's father, said, "Just his total independence and his attitude toward doing things has changed a lot" since the procedure. Before the treatment, the boy's pupils were so dilated they "looked like an owl," Mr. Haas said. One day, while outside raking leaves after the treatment, he noticed his son's pupils were constricted as they adjusted to the light. He saw that Corey's eyes were blue. "I'd never seen that before."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was gratifying to read Samuel Waxman and Richard Gambino's account of progress and promising treatment. It offers a much needed perspective on the progress of the "war on cancer" ("The New Ways We Fight Cancer," editorial page, Oct. 18). Gene therapy is one such promising treatment, as alluded to in the piece, that represents a revolutionary opportunity to relegate cancer to a chronic yet manageable disease -- with limited collateral damage to the body in the process. Key to confronting the biological and technological challenges to gene therapy's success is the continued increase of financial and moral support for those "incremental and time consuming processes" inherent to all complex research. Key to that is setting the record straight on the promise of gene therapy in treating cancer and offering the public responsible, innovative and trustworthy opportunities to participate in the battle against cancer.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TAYLORVILLE, Ill. — A few hours before she died this summer at the age of 36, Jolee Mohr lay in a Chicago hospital so swollen by internal bleeding and failing kidneys that her husband decided against bringing their   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">5-year-old daughter to say goodbye. The girl wouldn't have recognized her mother.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robb Mohr couldn't bring himself to watch her die and he spent his wife's last hours talking with her helpless and puzzled doctors. One vowed to get to the bottom of the illness, and there were several clues to go on.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most unusual was this: Jolee Mohr got sick the day after her right knee was injected with trillions of genetically engineered viruses in a voluntary experiment to find out if gene therapy might be a safe way to ease the pain of rheumatoid arthritis. She was dead three weeks later.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The sponsor of this nationwide experiment,  <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics Corp.</span> of Seattle, has halted the work and 127 patients are being evaluated, according to a company spokeswoman. No other problems have been reported, and the company believes patients were adequately informed of the risks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U.S. health officials are investigating Mohr's death, and the case is expected to be discussed Monday by advisers to the National Institutes of Health during a meeting in Bethesda, Md. There's a lot at stake, including answers for Robb Mohr, and the interests of  <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics.</span> But there are also questions about how medical studies are done and how much study volunteers are told of the risks.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"To me, it's an avoidable death," Mohr said during an interview at his home amid the cornfields of central Illinois. "And you're going to have to really show me a lot of stuff to convince me that it wasn't."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Therapy anything but   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There have been more than 800 gene therapy studies involving 5,000 U.S. patients since the NIH approved the nation's first human gene transfer study in 1989. Yet there are no approved therapies despite 17 years of research, and the only major success — a cure for the rare inherited immune disorder known as "bubble boy disease" — came with a high cost: leukemia linked in 2003 to the virus that delivered the treatment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the 1999 death of Arizona teenager Jesse Gelsinger is the only reported fatality that has been definitively linked with a U.S. gene therapy study, an NIH spokesman said. And Dr. Theodore Friedmann, who once headed the NIH committee that oversees gene therapy experiments, said developments in medicine often come with problems, even death.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even if gene therapy is found to be the cause of Jolee Mohr's death, Friedmann said, the method remains promising.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There's no question that this event is tragic for the family and the woman involved," he said. "It does simply point to the fact that we have a lot more to learn."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When Dr. Robert Trapp of the Arthritis Center in Springfield told Jolee Mohr about the gene therapy study, she had lived with rheumatoid arthritis for 14 years, her husband said. She kept the pain, stiffness and swelling in her joints under control with medication, and rarely missed time at her data entry job.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study used a genetically engineered virus that can infect cells without causing human disease. In simple terms, the virus is used as a vehicle to carry a new gene into the body.  <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics</span> hopes the gene will help the body make a protein that would ease arthritis pain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To enroll in the study, every patient had to have some form of inflammatory arthritis. Jolee Mohr had faith in Trapp, her doctor for seven years, her husband said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You trust your physician. He's your doctor. You trust him like you do your minister," Robb Mohr said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bioethicists talk of a "therapeutic misconception" — a belief among patients in early-stage research that they will get better. Jolee Mohr thought the experimental treatment might relieve the chronic pain in her right knee, her husband said, though this stage of the study was simply to find out if the treatment was safe.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fine print   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jolee Mohr signed a 15-page consent form Feb. 12.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The form mentioned some scary possibilities. It said that the genetically altered viruses in the study — called tgAAC94 — "could spread to other parts of your body. The risks of this are not known at this time."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Altered viruses can "damage the DNA in the cells of your body by inserting itself into your genes," it went on. "If this happens, it could put you at risk for developing cancer."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And on page 9, it said unknown side effects could result in "pain, discomfort, disability or, in rare circumstances, death."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mohr was randomly assigned to get the highest dosing level. By all accounts everything was fine after the first shot, in February. But she got sick the day after her second injection, on July 2, vomiting and running a fever.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trapp, who did not respond to several requests for an interview, enrolled "seven or eight" patients in the gene therapy study, according to his attorney, David Drake. He described Trapp's enrollment procedures only as "standard," and he declined to comment on how much money Trapp's clinic received from  <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics</span>, fees meant to reimburse costs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The investigation into Mohr's death could have steep consequences for  <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics.</span> The company, which employs 70, has no products on the market and several years ago cut workers and several of its programs.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A very exciting lead product with the possibility to meet significant unmet need could be jeopardized," said CEO H. Stewart Parker when asked what was at stake for the company.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She said the company believes the study was conducted with the "highest level" of responsibility and that it followed federal guidelines.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph"><span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics</span> believes Mohr might have died of a fungal infection that could be blamed on anti-arthritis drugs she was taking, Parker said. She noted that key tests have not yet been done that could link Mohr's death to the gene therapy study; a spokesman at University of Chicago, which is handling the tests, said they are under way but that several are needed to determine the cause of death.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mohr's family asked the university to lead the investigation into her death, but the FDA is also investigating, spokeswoman Karen Riley said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NIH began developing guidelines on gene therapy in the mid-1970s and formed the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee to review studies, procedures and safety.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mohr's death tops the agenda for the committee's regularly scheduled quarterly meeting Monday in Bethesda, Md. University of Chicago doctors will present autopsy results, though the cause of death and what role the gene therapy might have played are not expected to be ready by then.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Robb Mohr will be there.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's great that there's companies out there wanting to help people, but I also think there's companies out there that are trying to make millions of dollars on people before they can truly understand what's going on," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days before she fell ill, the family went boating. The last family snapshot of Jolee was taken on the boat by their daughter, Toree, and Jolee beams at the young photographer.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My wife has never looked so beautiful," Mohr said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She had nothing to gain from this study," he said. "Why would a 36-year-old mother of a 5-year-old that's going to kindergarten want to participate in something just to see how safe it is on her body? Nothing adds up."   </p>

</div><div class="author">By James C. Mullen </div><div>1523 words</div><div>27 April 2007</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2007, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the past 30 years, biotechnology has come to represent an American success story. With 1,400 public and private companies employing tens of thousands of people, the U.S. is universally considered to be the global biotech leader. America can brag that its biotechnology companies capture about 75% of the global revenue, have a highly educated, well-paid work force, conduct most of their research, development and manufacturing here at home, and are a net exporter in foreign trade.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, in the pursuit of scientific excellence, several of the larger European pharmaceutical companies have chosen to "outsource" biotech-related R&D operations to the U.S. How many industries can make such claims?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But perhaps the most important metric for America's biotechnology industry is the impact on the lives of real patients. For 30 years, we have been helping patients suffering from cancer to multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis to rare genetic disorders. Simply put, the industry has helped transform science into real cures -- which has meant less death and disability for our patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet while we have seen great progress, the unmet need is considerable:</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- About 1,500 people die every day in this country from cancer;</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- An estimated 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease. This number has doubled since 1980.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- There are approximately 400,000 MS patients in the U.S. Every week, about 200 more patients are diagnosed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">-- Thousands of patients today suffer from rare genetic disorders. Many of us have never even heard of these diseases -- but they traumatize patients, and leave behind a trail of broken, frustrated families.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What will the next 30 years mean for our industry and the patients we serve? The answer will depend in large measure on what happens in Washington over the next two years. Unfortunately, in recent months our lawmakers have stirred up a witch's brew of initiatives that is cause for some concern -- not only for the biotech industry, but for all Americans. Congress should take care when enacting new legislation that may squander America's global leadership in biotechnology. This is especially true as it relates to pricing, safety and generics.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Historically, biotech innovation in the U.S. has benefited from relatively free pricing. This invisible hand has allowed us to attract patient investors to fund research projects that take approximately 10 to 15 years and $1 billion apiece to bring to market. That is why the early steps by the House of Representatives to repeal the new Medicare drug benefit's noninterference clause are so problematic for biotechnology companies. Forcing our companies to negotiate directly with the federal government sends a clear signal to investors that prices will be dictated -- not negotiated -- by the agency that runs Medicare.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">We've seen price-control attempts before on biotechnology, and the results were not pretty. During the 1993-94 health-care reform debate, the biotech stock index fell approximately 40%. The retreat by investors was felt by large and small companies alike.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Actually repealing Medicare's non-interference clause could have similar results. Driving investors out of the industry would inhibit our efforts to turn new scientific tools and pathways -- such as those emerging from the Human Genome Project, stem-cell research, and information technology advances -- into real medicines to help patients in need.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the Senate recently blocked a repeal of Medicare's noninterference clause, this issue may well surface later in the year. The better option is to continue to support the Medicare Part D drug benefit. Independent polls suggest choice and competition among plans is driving up the quality of care for senior citizens, while driving down costs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the same time, we are dealing with an irrational drug-safety scare. The Vioxx panic started the drumbeat for tougher drug safety laws and an overhaul of FDA oversight. But consider an exhaustive analysis of drug-safety data recently conducted by Ernie Berndt of MIT and Tomas Phillipson of the University of Chicago. With their team of researchers, they concluded, among other things, that Congressional efforts in the 1990s to speed up FDA review times did not fuel a drug-safety crisis. Rather, the data indicate that about 2% to 3% of approved drugs continue to be withdrawn -- the same rate as before passage of these reforms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So a very careful balance has existed at the FDA for decades that looks at the benefits and risks of potential treatments to determine if they should be approved. It is not a perfect system. But then again, in the real world one's appetite for risk depends in large measure on the disease from which one suffers. In fact, every day patients make this "risk-risk" calculus. They decide whether the potential risk of a therapeutic option outweighs the risk of a given disorder. Thus cancer patients are willing to tolerate chemotherapy in an attempt to rid them of their disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">I have recently seen this risk-risk proposition up close. In February 2005, <span class="companylink">Biogen Idec</span> and our partners at Elan withdrew from the market a highly promising MS therapy called Tysabri because we had suddenly seen a very rare and serious potential side effect. We immediately heard from MS patients who were disappointed, frustrated and scared. Some had limited therapeutic options, and many of them knew that their future involved disability to the point of requiring a wheelchair. They organized, made their voices heard, and demanded a return of this treatment. Today, Tysabri is back on the market -- in no small measure because of the efforts of these MS patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experience reinforced to me that while our patients want to be warned of known risks, they also understand their disease and want -- even demand -- the right to choose their own therapies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Congress would be wise to keep these MS patients in mind when crafting new drug-safety legislation that may place roadblocks between doctors and their patients' care. If the intent is to really improve drug safety, we should provide robust, steady funding for the FDA. Approximately 53% of the agency's operating budget currently comes from drug company user fees. That is too high, and it fuels a perception problem for an agency that regulates 25% of the U.S. economy -- and almost everything Americans put into their bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, we need a strong, predictable patent framework that protects the work of our scientists while rewarding innovation. In the rush to embrace all things that appear to drive down health-care costs, Congress should step back and move very thoughtfully on any legislation concerning generic versions of biotech drugs. More accurately termed "biosimilar" legislation, getting this wrong could result in reduced R&D spending, or possibly unsafe drugs being pushed through a scientifically-flawed regulatory process.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Could this happen? Yes, because unlike traditional pharmaceuticals, which typically come in pill form, biotech products are large protein-based therapies that are usually injected by patients. They have a complex, three-dimensional structure, and their manufacturing process involves living cells in bioreactors. To help illustrate the difference in complexity, one can compare the approximate molecular weight of the popular pharmaceutical, Zantac (350D) to that of Epogen (30,000D), one of the leading biotech drugs used to help cancer patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To be clear, when the science is ready, biosimilars should be approved in the U.S. But the science should be demonstrated through rigorous clinical trials to help ensure patient safety. In fact, the European approach may serve as a model. They have taken early and prudent steps to ensure that benefits, risks and incentives for innovation are weighed in the process. In short, they have constructed a framework predicated on sound medical science -- not on political science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, there are important signs that Congress is concerned about the future of biotechnology -- and the impact on our future patients. Additional funding for basic biomedical research, for example, will be a boost for our industry. So will additional resources for science education at all levels. And there is some reason to hope that moderate voices in Congress will temper the early rush to embrace troubling legislation.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But if we stumble, China, India, Singapore and other emerging countries will gladly seize the leadership role. They are actively courting global biotechnology firms, and offer a potent blend of financial incentives, improving intellectual property laws and a vast pool of scientific talent and expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Who are the patients of the future? We see them every day -- in the mirror, in our neighbors, our spouses and our children. Directly or through our families and friends, we will all face death from cancer or a rare genetic disorder. Or the frustration of Alzheimer's or Parkinson's diseases. Or an MS relapse that may put us in a wheelchair for the first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What Congress does and does not do over the next two years may well impact the future of biotechnology -- and all of us -- for decades to come.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOCTORS WIPED OUT melanoma by reengineering patients' own cells, marking the first time gene therapy has worked successfully against a cancer and raising hopes that the treatment can eradicate other forms of the disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Government scientists took healthy immune cells from patients with advanced forms of the skin cancer and taught the cells to recognize and destroy the cancer cells. Doctors then fed patients the tailor-made fighter cells intravenously, and their tumors gradually shrank.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just two of the 17 patients in the study are still disease-free a year and a half after the treatment. But doctors said the research proved that the technique could help patients battling many forms of cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can now convert normal lymphocytes into cells that can recognize very common cancers like breast, lung, ovary, prostate and so on. We haven't treated those patients yet, but this represents proof that this kind of approach can work," said study author Dr. Steven Rosenberg, chief of surgery at the National Cancer Institute.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The other 15 patients in the study, published in today's issue of the journal Science, grew low levels of the reengineered immune cells for at least two months. Since the trial began in December 2004, scientists have developed more advanced gene therapy techniques that could improve the results, Rosenberg said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is totally intriguing," said Dr. Anna Pavlick, director of the NYU Cancer Institute's melanoma program.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it's too soon to call the therapy a cure, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They didn't look at survival and they wouldn't be able to in this small group of patients. That's why it's a little bit premature to know how effective this is going to be, but nonetheless it is a treatment that needs to be studied in a larger number of patients," said Dr. Howard Kaufman, director of the tumor immunotherapy program at New York Presbyterian Hospital Columbia.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melanoma is one of the deadliest and fastest-growing cancers in the United States. An estimated 62,190 people will develop the disease this year, and 7,910 will die of it, according to the American Cancer Society.  </p>

<div id="hd" ><b class='enHeadline'>New Gene Therapy Appears to Shrink Tumors in Two Cases</b>
</div><div class="author">By Mark Schoofs </div><div>1254 words</div><div>1 September 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR THE FIRST time in the history of cancer treatment, gene therapy has apparently succeeded in shrinking and even eradicating large, metastatic tumors.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The therapy worked in only two of 17 patients who were treated. But many researchers are hailing the study, which was published yesterday in the online edition of Science, as groundbreaking because it provides compelling evidence in human patients that gene therapy can be effective against one of the toughest challenges in medicine: terminal cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moreover, the technique used in this pilot study -- genetically altering immune-system cells so that they target tumors -- could eventually be used against many different kinds of cancers, not just the cancer that afflicted patients in this trial, which was melanoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's very impressive," said David Baltimore, a Nobel laureate who is conducting similar research. Dr. Baltimore noted key caveats: Only a small number of patients responded to the treatment, and the study's lack of a control group means there is no way to be absolutely sure that the treatment was responsible for those patients' improvement. Because the patients had late-stage melanoma that almost never goes into remission on its own, had failed all conventional treatment and responded as soon as they were given the experimental treatment, "it's likely" that gene therapy is what worked against their cancer, said Dr. Baltimore. He cautioned that "likely and proven are two different things" but added that the study is "a significant step forward that tells me about directions to go in" with further research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings arrive on the heels of some positive developments for gene therapy, which involves inserting genes into a patient's cells to compensate for an inherited genetic defect or to enable the body to fight a disease on its own, without taking medicine. Many scientists believe gene therapy is the future of medicine, but the field has suffered from maximal hype, minimal success, and even a few disastrous side effects, including therapy-induced leukemia and death.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, over the past few years, research teams in Europe and the U.S. have reported success using gene therapy to treat a variety of inherited immune disorders. And this spring, a team at the Children's Hospital of Pennsylvania and Stanford University came tantalizingly close to alleviating hemophilia: They were able to prompt the body of one patient to produce enough blood-clotting factor on its own so that for 10 weeks he had no bleeding episodes or any need to have infusions of clotting medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These studies, though, all involved ailments caused by a single deleterious mutation inherited at birth. The new research contends with cancer, a much more complex disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was led by Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute, a veteran of both gene therapy and cancer research. Dr. Rosenberg, a surgeon who removed President Reagan's colon-cancer tumor in 1985, also helped pioneer immunotherapy, which tries to deploy the body's own immune system rather than toxic chemotherapy drugs and radiation to fight cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosenberg had already shown that certain tumor-attacking immune-system cells, called CD8 killer T-cells, could be taken out of patients, multiplied in test tubes, and then transfused back into those same patients. About half of the roughly 100 patients treated this way see their tumors shrink 50% or more, according to Dr. Rosenberg. One early patient, code-named Patient 9, responded particularly well, with his tumors shrinking in size more than 95%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But this strategy can work only in those lucky individuals whose bodies naturally produce T-cells that target their tumors. Many melanoma patients lack such T-cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus, for the new study, Dr. Rosenberg and his colleagues took Patient 9's T-cells and genetically isolated the component -- called the T-cell receptor -- that enabled them to home in on the tumor cell. Next, they removed T-cells from 17 melanoma patients and genetically spliced in Patient 9's receptor. Finally, they multiplied those cells and transfused billions of them into the patients, who underwent a rigorous medical regimen to help the cells grow in their bodies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two patients treated this way showed dramatic and durable regression in their tumors. In one patient, 41-year-old Thomas May, a quality engineer at Ford Motor Co. in Detroit, the cancer that had spread to his lung completely disappeared. In the other patient, 53-year-old Mark Origer, a postmaster and father of three in Wisconsin, a tumor in his armpit melted away and a golfball-sized metastasis in his liver shrank 89%, at which point it was surgically removed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. May recalls that before the treatment another team of doctors had recommended surgical removal of his entire left lung, and a melanoma expert had told him his diagnosis was probably a death sentence. Referring to Dr. Rosenberg's team, he says, "Those guys saved my bacon." As for Mr. Origer, when Dr. Rosenberg walked into the exam room and gave him the good news, he says he felt "euphoria."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Messrs. May and Origer remain healthy and free of cancer more than a year and a half after their treatment, say Dr. Rosenberg and the two patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No one in the study suffered adverse effects attributable to the genetically engineered T-cells, though experts caution that some gene-therapy side effects have only surfaced years later, and that adding new T-cell receptors could lead a patient's immune system to attack healthy tissue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's not clear why the response rate wasn't higher. One possibility: The receptor from Patient 9 turned out to be less powerful than Dr. Rosenberg originally hoped, and he now believes it may have been too weak to overcome the disease in most patients. But new techniques have enabled his team to identify other T-cell receptors that are much more powerful, and that target other cancers. In fact, Dr. Rosenberg's team recently engineered human T-cells to carry a T-cell receptor from an entirely different species: a mouse. In test-tube experiments, this mouse receptor targets tumors that human T-cells almost never can, including many breast and colon cancer tumors. The researchers haven't yet tested these mouse-derived T-cells in humans but plan to do so soon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another possible reason for failure: Genetically engineering a T-cell involves a host of technical elements, and shortcomings in any of them could undermine the treatment. For example, the new receptor can mix with the cell's natural receptor in a way that makes each of them less potent. Also, the gene for the receptor is delivered to the T-cells by loading it on a harmless carrier virus, called a vector. Since Dr. Rosenberg's team started the trial, better vectors have been developed, and that improvement could boost the proportion of patients who respond to the therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Finally, there is a sobering possibility: The tumor cells may have mutated to escape the T-cell attack, allowing them to keep growing unchecked. That is known to happen in some cancer cells, and points to a possible limitation to gene therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In any case, Dr. Rosenberg, like many other researchers, believes that gene therapy will eventually be shown to work best in combination with other methods of stimulating the immune system and disabling cancer cells. He and other teams are planning trials to test some of these approaches. </p>

<div id="hd" ><b class='enHeadline'>Gene Therapy Is Successfully Used To Treat Two With Rare Disease</b>
</div><div class="author">By Gautam Naik </div><div>447 words</div><div>3 April 2006</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2006, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- A team of international scientists has used gene therapy to successfully treat two patients with a rare but deadly disease of the immune system, marking a small step in the push toward DNA-based medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a study published yesterday in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers described how they introduced a corrective gene to undo the damage caused by a form of chronic granulomatous disease, or CGD. The rare affliction, which is more commonly inherited by men, makes patients extremely vulnerable to infections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gene therapy has continued to be difficult, but we are making progress," said Christof von Kalle, professor at the Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center and at the National Center for Tumor Diseases Heidelberg in Germany. Dr. von Kalle is one of several authors of the Nature Medicine study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics have suggested that gene therapy faltered because it moved too quickly from the lab into clinical trials. The field suffered a setback in 1999 with the death of a study volunteer at the University of Pennsylvania. A few years ago, 28 children participated in European gene-therapy trials aimed at treating another rare disorder called severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID. Of the 28 children, 24 were deemed to be successfully treated, but three others developed a leukemia-like disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the latest gene-therapy experiment, conducted by researchers in Germany, Switzerland, Britain and the U.S., two men with CGD were treated with gene therapy for 1 1/2 years. Each of the two patients had inherited a defective gene that makes it difficult for their bodies to produce a particular enzyme. As a result, their myeloid cells, a form of white-blood cell, can't mount the appropriate response against fungal or bacterial infections.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To fix the problem, researchers used a virus to ferry corrective genes for the enzyme into the patients. The appropriate genes got switched on. But in a surprise to the scientists, the gene-corrected blood cells also tripled in number, improving the performance of the therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinically, both patients are in good shape and no longer have to take round-the-clock antibiotics, Dr. von Kalle said. Abscesses that had formed in the lungs of one patient and in the liver of the other have disappeared. So far, neither patient is suffering negative side effects, he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment is one of the first to show that gene therapy can successfully treat diseases of the myeloid system. Scientists refrain from pronouncing their achievement a cure, until they verify the effects last over time. </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mike Castle lay motionless as surgeons drilled two holes into his skull and injected a virus deep into his brain. The virus carries a gene and a tantalizing hope: that just maybe it could stall the Parkinson's disease slowly crippling him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Illinois man is among a few dozen patients enrolling in the first attempts at gene therapy for Parkinson's, a milestone in the quest to better treat the degenerative brain disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a time of excitement and caution: These first three studies are to see if gene therapy is safe to try, not to prove if it works. Yet studies in monkeys suggest at least one of the approaches has the potential to finally target the underlying disease, not merely tame its symptoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's this delicate balance between giving [patients] hope but making it clear to them, and to the world, that this is still highly experimental," says William J. Marks Jr. of the University of California, San Francisco, who is leading the most closely watched approach -- using a nerve growth factor to rescue dying brain cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a gamble," agrees Leo Verhagen of Chicago's Rush University Medical Center, a co-researcher in the project who treated Mr. Castle. "This is the first trial that, if it works, could slow down the disease's progression," he explains. Yet to stress the experiment's unknowns, he bluntly told Mr. Castle, "We are happy if we don't make you worse."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parkinson's disease gradually destroys brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical crucial for the cellular communication that controls muscle movement. As dopamine levels drop, symptoms increase: tremors in the arms, legs and face; periodically stiff or frozen limbs; slow movement; impaired balance and coordination. About 1.5 million Americans have the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standard treatments are to replace lost dopamine with the drug levodopa, and a brain implant to control tremors. Both work for a while, but can't stop the disease's inevitable march. To do that, scientists have long sought ways to protect remaining dopamine-producing neurons, or nerve cells, and rescue dying ones. A candidate: growth factors, protective proteins naturally found in healthy brains.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the UCSF and Rush study, the brains of 12 patients are being injected with a harmless virus that carries the gene for one growth factor, called neurturin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neurturin is a sister to the better-known growth factor GDNF, an experimental drug believed to be showing promise against Parkinson's until a study infusing it directly into the brain was halted for safety concerns. Moreover, infusions don't allow the growth factor to spread deep enough to reach Parkinson's most crucial brain region, Dr. Verhagen says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists hope gene therapy can get around those issues. Rush neuroscientist Jeffrey Kordower found that monkeys with Parkinson's-like damage significantly improved within three months of receiving growth-factor gene therapy, as injured neurons were rescued. He co-founded California-based Ceregene Inc., which is developing the neurturin gene therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gene therapy offers another mechanism in which to get these growth factors into the brain," said Diane Murphy, a neurodegenerative disease specialist at the National Institutes of Health. "That's why people are interested in this, since the infusion methods seem to be problematic."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Aside from infection and bleeding as side effects of the brain injections, gene therapy's biggest risk is that it can't be switched off if side effects appear. But, "patients are more willing to take risks with something that may help in a more fundamental way," notes Ms. Murphy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why Mr. Castle, 46 years old, enrolled. Medication controlled his symptoms for over a decade, but he finds it increasingly difficult to walk, with episodes of stumbling and freezing. About two months after undergoing gene therapy, Mr. Castle says he notices small improvements in walking, episodes his doctors greet cautiously.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"As far as I was concerned, it was the opportunity of a lifetime," Mr. Castle says. "If it works, I'm ecstatic. If it doesn't, I'll be disappointed, but I'll at least know I tried." </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALAMEDA — After twelve unprofitable years, Avigen Inc. has decided to stop funding its experimental gene therapy platform and instead focus its limited capital on developing traditional pharmaceuticals. The move could mean added layoffs for the 60-person Alameda company, yet also renewed interest from Wall Street.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy has been touted for years as the possible cure for numerous ailments, but much of the promise remains unproven. To date, no gene therapy drug has been approved in the U.S.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avigen said Tuesday that it will preserve its ongoing clinical trials for its gene therapy treatment for Parkinson's disease through external funding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By doing so, the company expects to reduce its annual cash burn rate from $23 million in 2004 to $13 million in 2005. At the end of 2004, Avigen had $76 million in cash.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avigen will now focus on acquiring later-stage clinical drug candidates and developing its internal small molecule drug that treats neuropathic pain.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a research note, CIBC World Markets biotech analyst Tariq Kassum said Avigen's refocusing should lessen development risk and allow the company to mature more rapidly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We believe that discontinuing gene therapy, an unproven area, will ultimately generate more investor interest (at Avigen)," Kassum wrote.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Avigen said it is in advanced discussions with several parties on either selling off or merging its gene therapy program and expects to announce a decision in coming months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another option includes operating the clinical programs through academic institutions and then terminating internal operations and sub-leasing out the manufacturing space at its 112,500-square-foot Alameda complex, the company said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A person familiar with the company said a new round of layoffs also is likely. Avigen officials, who were presenting at the CIBC biotech conference in New York City, did not return calls seeking comment. Last July, Avigen laid off 39 percent of its work force.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">shortly after it ended clinical trials for its gene therapy treatment for hemophilia.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">My heart sank as I read Sharon Begley's straightforward "Science Journal" column on gene therapy ("Why Gene Therapy Still Hasn't Produced Major Breakthroughs," Marketplace, Feb. 18). I am the mother of four children born with severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome, which was mentioned in the column. A transplant of my bone marrow restored the T-cells of their immune system, which fight viruses and fungus infections. But the B-cell side, which protects against bacterial infection, is still incomplete.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Five years ago, Duke University, in conjunction with St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, told my husband and me that our children would be excellent candidates for gene therapy to restore their B-cell function and eliminate the need for periodic infusions of antibodies. But Jesse Gelsinger died a few months later. Leukemia struck the X-linked SCIDS trials. Research and hope ground to a halt.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But of all the bubble-bursting in your column, the point that most upset me was learning that biotech companies are searching for a quick, money-making hit and are unwilling to fund the long-term research and experiments necessary for a safe breakthrough.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- Federal health advisers recommended that gene-therapy treatments for children with a severe immune deficiency be restricted to those who have no alternative.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Food and Drug Administration convened the panel after a 3-year-old French boy became the third child to develop cancer after receiving gene therapy for treatment of X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, or X-SCID. The FDA had asked U.S. researchers doing similar work to put it on hold.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors and scientists on the advisory panel said they didn't want to withhold the therapy from children who have already failed to respond to bone-marrow transplants, an alternative treatment. But they noted that the number of such children -- who under Friday's recommendation would still be able to have experimental gene therapy -- is very small.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What is happening here today -- the big picture -- is that it shows the difficulty in developing any new class of therapy," said Dr. Daniel Salomon, professor in the Scripps Research Institute and a member of the FDA panel. "There was a period of time that there was a tendency to say gene therapy . . . had been safe. What's clear now is that [problems can develop in] some gene therapy for some diseases."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The panel recommended that gene-therapy trials could go forward for a similar ailment called ADA-SCID, finding it is a different issue and no reason to limit that treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten children suffering with X-SCID were basically cured in the French study, which at first was greeted with great excitement as a breakthrough in gene therapy, said Dr. Warren Leonard, panel member from the National Institutes of Health. But three later developed leukemia, and one of them died. </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">KATHERINE HIGH thought she was making progress. She and her team had managed to take the human gene that produces Factor IX, a blood-clotting substance that people with hemophilia lack, and slip it into a harmless virus called AAV. The virus played Trojan horse, carrying the gene into lab mice and dogs. There, it worked its way into the animals' DNA and produced enough clotting factor to cure their hemophilia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But when Dr. High, a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and her colleagues launched human trials in 2001, the picture darkened. They injected the gene-carrying viruses into the livers of seven patients. Two produced measurable amounts of Factor IX, 3% and 12% of the normal level. But within a few weeks the levels became undetectable, Dr. High reported last year. The patients' immune systems had apparently killed the cells containing the inserted gene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. High had some ideas about how to fix that. But in May the biotech company sponsoring her work bailed out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So it has gone for gene therapy, the great hope of the genetic revolution. The idea was simplicity itself: Use a safe virus to carry a healthy gene into the cells of patients who suffer from a genetic disease -- sickle cell, cystic fibrosis, hemophilia -- because their own version of that gene is kaput. Rather than treating the downstream effects of the broken DNA, gene therapy would fix what was actually broken.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IF ONLY. Since 1989 there have been more than 350 gene-therapy trials world-wide intended to help patients. Of the thousands in the trials, about a dozen, all children with a rare immune disorder, have been cured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was so much optimism and naivete," says Donald Kohn of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, who conducts gene-therapy trials with bone-marrow cells. "What worked so well in mice in the 1980s -- the reason for the optimism -- turned out to be very difficult to translate into humans."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For one thing, in mice the target cells tend to divide constantly and "easily take up the foreign gene," he explains. It wasn't unusual to get the gene into 50% of certain mouse cells. Not so in humans, where 0.1% is a triumph. In fact, in what seems like sheer spite on nature's part, human bone marrow cells that take in the foreign gene are also the ones that function for only a few weeks, leaving no lasting therapeutic benefit, explains Dr. Kohn; human cells in which the gene has a good chance of functioning over the long run resist taking it in.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No wonder the field seems cursed.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, 18-year-old volunteer Jesse Gelsinger died when he experienced a fatal inflammatory reaction to gene therapy. Last week the U.S. Justice Department announced a settlement with the scientist who ran that trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2002 and 2003, three little boys in what had been gene therapy's one successful trial developed a leukemia-like disease. The children had X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency, or X-SCID, a potentially fatal disorder related to "bubble boy" syndrome that leaves victims with essentially no immune system. The inserted DNA had found the one-in-a-million spot that activated a cancer-causing gene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FEW GENE-THERAPY trials end in tragedy, but most end in failure. In many cases, the inserted gene stops working. In the first trial of its kind, in 1993, Ronald Crystal of Cornell University's Weill Medical College used a cold virus to ferry into patients' lung cells a healthy gene meant to replace the one that causes cystic fibrosis. That part went fine. But the gene stopped working after a week. The patients' immune systems had noticed the virus and tore apart the cells harboring it and its DNA cargo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now gene therapy has encountered its most daunting obstacle yet: the impatience of biotech companies. The single-gene diseases it first targeted are almost all "orphan diseases," notes Dr. Crystal, meaning they claim no more than a few hundred victims at any one time. With the prospect of such a tiny market, companies sponsoring gene-therapy trials are increasingly unwilling to stick with any that encounter the slightest glitch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gene therapy has been `five years away' for 20 years," says biotech executive John Crowley, chairman and CEO of Amicus Therapeutics, North Brunswick, N.J. "When you have concerns about the economics of this, and add failure after failure, venture capitalists are saying there are better places to put our money."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Partly as a result, gene therapy is shifting to complex (and common) diseases. Of the gene-therapy trials now under way, 60% target cancer. Only 10% aim to treat the rare, single-gene diseases for which the technique was invented.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And today's dreams are much more modest. Gene therapy for cancer would induce a patient's immune system to kill tumor cells by tagging them with molecules that say "foreign." But because some cells would escape this fate and keep replicating, gene therapy would almost surely be just another arrow in a quiver that includes surgery, radiation and chemotherapy, says Dr. Crystal. Assuming it worked at all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- The Department of Justice announced civil settlements in connection with a gene therapy study at the University of Pennsylvania that ended in the death of a teenager in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The University of Pennsylvania and Children's National Medical Center in Washington each agreed to pay the government more than $500,000, U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania announced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Also, restrictive controls will be placed on the clinical-research activities of three investigators involved in the study, the U.S. Attorney's office said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, Jesse Gelsinger, an 18-year-old from Arizona, died at Penn's hospital soon after receiving an injection of therapeutic genes designed to address a rare genetic liver disease. The death led to tougher federal rules on studies of gene therapy, an experimental technique designed to correct defective genes that cause disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The government had alleged that the researchers and their institutions made false statements and claims in applying for government grants and in reporting data to the Food and Drug Administration. The government alleged that before the teenager's death, the study had produced "toxicities" in humans that should have ended the study, yet the study continued.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the settlement agreement, the University of Pennsylvania, Children's National Medical Center and the researchers didn't admit to the government's allegations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The family of the teen settled a wrongful-death lawsuit against his doctors and the University of Pennsylvania in 2000.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three researchers involved in the gene-therapy study were James Wilson and Steven Raper, both doctors at the University of Pennsylvania; and Mark Batshaw, a former Penn doctor and now chief academic officer at Children's National Medical Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the settlement, Dr. Wilson will not serve as sponsor of an FDA-regulated clinical trial for the next five years. He hasn't been involved with human research participants since January 2000, the U.S. Attorney's office said. Dr. Wilson faces other restrictions and also has agreed to lecture and write about lessons he learned from the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a written statement provided by Penn, Dr. Wilson said "reaching this agreement means that I may continue to devote myself fully and without restriction to my laboratory research and that I may conduct clinical research when it would be appropriate for scientific advancement." He said his research in the past few years has focused on discovering and designing "new gene transfer vectors for gene therapy and genetic vaccines."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the settlements, Drs. Batshaw and Raper must complete educational and training requirements related to protections for human participants in clinical research over a three-year period, according to the U.S. Attorney's office.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Children's National Medical Center said Dr. Batshaw wasn't available to comment. Dr. Raper couldn't immediately be reached for comment. </p>

<div id="hd" ><b class='enHeadline'>New Gene Therapy May Cut Damage Of Heart Attacks</b>
</div><div class="author">By Ron Winslow </div><div>568 words</div><div>3 August 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have developed a novel gene-therapy strategy that they say could one day help prevent or reduce the damage from heart attacks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach couples a therapeutic gene with a genetic sensor that can trigger release of the treatment when it detects that the heart muscle is being starved of oxygen -- a telltale consequence of a heart attack. In studies in laboratory rats, the scientists, from Brigham and Women's Hospital, Boston, and Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C., significantly reduced damage to the animals' hearts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nearly 900,000 Americans will suffer a heart attack this year, according to the American Heart Association. Crucial to their long-term prognosis is how quickly they get treated after symptoms begin.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While balloon angioplasty and devices called stents that prop open treated blood vessels as well as clot-busting drugs are effective treatments, patients are at risk of severe and irreversible damage to the muscle if the clot causing the attack isn't cleared within four to six hours. That's because heart muscle cells die if they are deprived of oxygen that long. If patients survive, they are likely to develop congestive heart failure, an increasingly common result of a weakened heart.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drugs that can protect the heart have been developed, but patients often fail to get to the hospital in time to benefit from them, said Victor Dzau, who became chancellor of health affairs at Duke University last month. He and his former colleagues at Brigham and Women's Hospital devised what they describe as the new "smart gene therapy" in what amounts to a pre-emptive strike to lengthen the time conventional heart attack treatments would be effective.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the rat experiments, scientists combined a gene that can detect oxygen deficiency with a second gene, called heme-oxgenase 1, that, in effect, puts heart cells into hibernation. The sensor gene was designed to activate the treatment when it detected a lack of oxygen and to turn it off when oxygenated blood was restored to the tissue.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists injected the treatment into heart-muscle tissue via a deactivated adenovirus, a common technique in gene therapy. Five weeks later, they induced heart attacks in the animals. Treated rats had a fivefold increase in activity of the treatment gene and substantially less damage to muscle tissue from one to four months after the heart attack. In addition, scientists found the treatment worked in some rats more than a year after it was delivered, suggesting that the therapy lies dormant until a heart attack creates conditions that trigger the genetic switch.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research was sponsored by the National Institutes of Health. The results appear this week in the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This shouldn't be a substitute for treatment to open vessels for a heart attack," said Dr. Dzau, principal investigator for the study. "But it could be a way of protecting the heart muscle when you need the time."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Dzau said it would be 18 to 24 months before the technique could be tried in people. Even if all goes well it would likely be several years before such a treatment reached the market. Among many questions is how patients would be determined eligible for the preventive strategy. </p>

</div><div class="author">By Gautam Naik </div><div>647 words</div><div>27 May 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- An intriguing animal experiment suggests gene therapy one day may offer hope to people with motor neuron disease, such as Lou Gehrig's disease, a debilitating affliction for which there is no cure.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the mouse experiment, described in today's edition of the British journal Nature, the therapy helped to slow the onset and progression of the disease, while increasing life expectancy by a significant 30%. Though the study has yet to be replicated in humans and the field of gene therapy still is in its infancy, the results are encouraging.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's certainly one of the best results we've seen in animal studies for any treatment," said Brian Dickie, director of research development at the Motor Neuron Disease Association in Britain. The experiment was conducted by Oxford BioMedica PLC, a British biotechnology company, and scientists from the University of Leuven in Belgium.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Oxford BioMedica said it plans to start human trials of the gene therapy in 2006.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The most common form of motor neuron disease is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or Lou Gehrig's disease, which causes the motor neurons in the brain and spinal cord to degenerate progressively. Patients suffer paralysis, and most die within three to five years of diagnosis. ALS afflicts about 100,000 people in Europe and the U.S., and there are few treatment options. The handful of drugs available today relieve symptoms and only one -- Rilutek made by Aventis SA of France -- has shown modest effects in slowing progression of the disease and extending survival.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy typically involves replacing, removing or introducing genes in order to treat disease. In Oxford BioMedica's experiment, researchers wanted to introduce a gene that would pump out a growth factor known as VEGF, which they hoped would prevent the spontaneous death of nerve cells that occurs in ALS.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The big challenge: how to introduce the gene via a simple injection into the muscle, and then get it to travel intact to the key site of action, the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company's researchers achieved this by creating a special delivery vehicle. The outer "capsule" was a modified horse virus stripped of its genes, into which was inserted the VEGF gene. Certain proteins on the surface of the virus also were replaced with proteins from a rabies virus, which are efficient in entering nerve cells. The entire delivery capsule was injected into muscle cells of mice that were bred to get a disease that closely resembles ALS in people. The gene then traveled to nerve cells and began producing sufficient amounts of VEGF.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon after, "the motion of the mice improved, and they were all able to feed," said Alan Kingsman, chief executive officer of Oxford BioMedica.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a vital move, the gene therapy was done after the mice first began to show symptoms, when about half of their nerve cells would have been dead. "As treatment of ALS patients is at present initiated only after diagnosis of the disease, such an experiment is important," the authors of the study noted.</p>

<div id="hd" ><b class='enHeadline'>Gene Therapy May Slow Spread Of Alzheimer's</b>
</div><div class="author">By Antonio Regalado </div><div>489 words</div><div>28 April 2004</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2004, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy could safely slow the progress of Alzheimer's disease, according to a small pilot study in patients suffering from the common and devastating brain illness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study represents the first attempt to use gene therapy to treat Alzheimer's, according to Mark Tuszynski, a neurologist at the University of California, San Diego, who led the effort.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Biotechnology company Ceregene Inc., of San Diego, owns rights to the approach and plans to finance a larger study that is to start this year. Ceregene is a subsidiary of Cell Genesys Inc., a gene-therapy company in Foster City, Calif. Dr. Tuszynski is a founder of Ceregene and holds stock in the company.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eight patients between 53 and 76 years old received the new treatment and were followed for up to two years. They experienced a 40% slowdown in how quickly their symptoms worsened. If those results hold up in larger studies, Dr. Tuszynski said, it could mean that a typical patient would gain an extra two years before requiring nursing-home or other full-time care.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alzheimer's strips its victims of their memory and ability to live an independent life within about seven years of diagnosis, according to Dr. Tuszynski. Although several drugs have been approved to treat Alzheimer's, they offer only limited benefits.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This could be a big advance over standard treatment if the effect holds up," said Dr. Tuszynski. He cautioned that the study was too small to prove with certainty if the technique is working.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy has a troubled history. The technology, designed as a way to add new DNA to a patient's cells, has yet to lead to any widely marketed medical treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study, scientists modified cells from the patients' skin by adding copies of a gene that produces nerve growth factor, or NGF. The modified cells were then implanted in patients' brains using a thin needle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The NGF protein is believed to protect neurons in the brain from dying. The treatment "could put off the long-term loss of the cells in the brain," Dr. Tuszynski said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceregene President Jeff Ostrove said his company had approval from the Food and Drug Administration to conduct further studies. The tests will begin later this year at a hospital in Chicago, Dr. Ostrove said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ceregene's studies, of approximately 40 patients, will look at the effect of inserting genes directly into the brain rather than using modified skin cells. The new approach is considered more commercially viable.</p>

<div id="hd" ><b class='enHeadline'>Personal Health (A Special Report): Taking Control --- The Genetic Front Lines: At the Salk Institute, the promise of gene therapy has never seemed brighter; But the risks have never been more obvious</b>
</div><div class="author">By Bernard Wysocki Jr. </div><div>1862 words</div><div>9 December 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R9</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LA JOLLA, Calif. -- More than a decade has passed since scientists began a form of genetic engineering known as gene therapy, injecting genes into living organisms as reinforcements in the body's battle against a variety of serious diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From the start, the technique seemed full of both promise and pitfalls. And these days, that tension is probably greater than ever before, because the scientific advances are looking so promising, while the risks have become all too obvious.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Perhaps no group of people understands the tensions better than the 70 scientists and staffers here at the genetics laboratory of the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, a 43-year-old private research institute perched on a cliff overlooking the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On the one hand, the scientific breakthroughs are coming fast and furious. Just four months ago, for instance, a team here announced a potential gene therapy for Lou Gehrig's disease, in which a gene for a growth hormone was packaged inside a virus and injected into mice. The gene was designed to instruct failing motor nerve cells not to die, and it produced stunning results, greatly prolonging the lives of the experimental mice. Here at Salk, as elsewhere, many more inventive therapies are in the pipeline, with some of the most promising treatments targeting Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Huntington's and other illnesses in which the main pathology is the death of neurons or nerve cells in the brain and central nervous system.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But while Salk and other research centers have been achieving these breakthroughs, at least one death and other serious calamities in gene-therapy trials -- none of them at Salk, which doesn't conduct experiments with people -- have cast a pall over gene-therapy research around the world. The troubles have reverberated here at Salk, which was founded by Jonas Salk, of polio-vaccine fame, in 1960 and has been a pioneer ever since in basic biological research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death of an 18-year-old patient, Jesse Gelsinger, came in 1999, during a clinical trial at the University of Pennsylvania. The injection of a gene, via a virus, into Mr. Gelsinger's liver to treat a rare liver ailment triggered an immune response that resulted in multiple organ failure similar to toxic-shock syndrome. Then last year in France, two of eight patients being treated for severe immunodeficiency syndrome developed leukemia. In the wake of that, the Food and Drug Administration curtailed a portion of the gene-therapy trials being conducted in the U.S.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Donald Kohn, a pediatrician at Children's Hospital in Los Angeles and president of the American Society of Gene Therapy, says that after the Jesse Gelsinger death, "the FDA said you have to come to a higher standard" in conducting clinical trials, including much greater documentation of all aspects of the trials. The new obstacles, Dr. Kohn says, have been a deterrent to conducting these trials in academia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kohn adds that while the promise of gene therapy remains great, the leukemia cases in France serve as a reminder that "there are a lot of biological issues we don't know about." As a result, he says, "bridging that gap" between running experiments in mice and running trials in humans is "challenging, and not as easy as we thought 10 years ago."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here at Salk, senior scientists who for years have pioneered the techniques don't minimize the risks of injecting viruses, as gene-delivery mechanisms, into the body. "The body knows these guys are not good guys," says Inder Verma, a professor at Salk. "They are foreign, so the body immediately mounts an immune response against them. That's why this child Jesse Gelsinger died."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The immune response is just one potential problem with gene therapy. Dr. Verma ticks off others: A gene designed to rid the body of one disease could lodge in the wrong place and cause diabetes, for example. Or the injected material could somehow trigger unprecedented growth in the form of tumors, including cancerous ones.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paradox of gene therapy is that some of the most potent viruses can be the most powerful forces for good, if properly harnessed. Dr. Verma has spent years developing one of the most powerful of these viral "vectors." It is a disabled form of the HIV virus, which ordinarily consists of nine genes. In the lab, scientists remove six of the genes responsible for the virulent infection associated with AIDS. Then, scientists further manipulate the "envelope" gene so that it attaches to cells in the right manner. Though disabled, this form of the HIV virus nevertheless remains an expert at breaking into cells, almost like a house burglar with special tools for door locks. For the gene therapist, this talent for breaking and entering is good, because the virus can then deliver its payload -- the new gene -- inside the cell. Moreover, while some viruses can enter only cells that are dividing, the HIV virus can enter nondividing cells, such as those in the mature human brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, Salk scientists used the disabled HIV virus in research on mice that had been bred with a human gene for Alzheimer's. Once the mice developed large plaques of beta amyloid, the telltale sign of degeneration in Alzheimer's patients, the Salk scientists zapped a memory center of their brains with the disabled HIV virus -- at first without any gene payload, in effect a trial run. On the computer screens used to interpret chemical changes in the brain, the brains of autopsied mice showed a fluorescent green, indicating that the virus had infected the memory center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Next, Robert Marr, a Salk postdoctoral fellow, packaged into the virus a gene for the enzyme neprilysin, believed to attack and reduce the plaques. Once again, the experiment worked -- with a stunning 49% reduction in plaques in the treated mice, based on autopsies.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These days, Dr. Marr is working with the nearby University of California at San Diego to give similarly impaired mice a battery of cognitive tests, to see whether these "Alzheimer's victims" have better memories if they get injected with the neprilysin-carrying virus. In one test, the mice -- which, like all mice, dislike water -- first swim around in a tub, searching for a small platform just below the surface. Then, to test their memories, the platform is withdrawn, but the mice still try to find the spot where the platform used to be. Letters or pictures on the walls around the basin provide visual cues, and a camera records the mice's every movement, plotting the course they follow as mathematical figures. The treated mice are supposed to find the spot where the platform used to be much faster than the untreated mice. So far, Dr. Marr says, the results look promising.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The Alzheimer's field is a pretty bright one for new therapies," says Dr. Marr.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a long ways from testing mice to testing humans. And with even the most promising science running up against the prevailing caution at the FDA and within the research world itself, it will probably be several years before human clinical trials of neprilysin begin. But, reflecting how far the basic science has come, that's a much shorter time frame than in the early days of gene therapy. In the case of one very small clinical trial, involving a human growth factor in the brain of elderly Alzheimer's patients, it took 12 years -- from 1989 until 2001 -- to move from the first published paper on the topic, by Salk faculty member Fred Gage, to the first experiments in a few people.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gene-therapy program for Lou Gehrig's disease, formally known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS, is also showing promise. The first result of the gene-therapy experiment in mice was announced only in August. But because Salk has partnerships for the research with a number of entities including Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Gage expects that human trials may begin within two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This breakthrough began with a remarkable finding by a Salk research fellow, Brian Kaspar. A few years ago, he discovered that a certain virus, called the adeno-associated virus, or AAV, could move in reverse direction -- that is, rather than just traveling from the brain or spinal cord to the motor muscles in the arms and legs, the AAV virus could start at the extremities and move back to the spinal cord.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gage recalls brainstorming with Mr. Kaspar, and they hit upon ALS as a disease that might be treated with this reverse-course, or retrograde, virus. If a virus packed with the right gene was injected into the failing muscles of a mouse -- or human -- suffering from ALS, the gene might produce a protein that traveled back to the source of the problem -- and attacked it at the source of the motor failure. The Salk scientists tested several genes, including one that produced a protein called insulin-like growth factor, hoping it would travel back to the spinal cord and slow or even stop the inexorable death of cells at the source.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one crucial test, Mr. Kaspar and his colleagues injected the muscles of mice, performed autopsies on them and looked for telltale fluorescent coloring to mark the spread of the "good" genes. "The computer lit up green," Mr. Kaspar recalls. "It was a happy day." More important, the drug slowed the progress of the disease. Symptoms appeared later in the treated mice than in the mice without the treatment. The mice had been bred with a particularly virulent strain of ALS, causing them to die within about 120 days of birth if not treated. But the treated mice had far longer life spans, in some cases extending to more than 200 days. The research was funded by Project ALS, the Christopher Reeve Foundation and two institutes within the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the results were published in the journal Science in August, Dr. Gage says, the acute tensions over clinical trials began to develop. Some of the problems are merely practical, if mind-numbingly complex: "How many injections? What muscles? What is the dose?" says Dr. Gage, listing the decisions facing the committee formed to prepare for human experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">(MORE)</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some advocates argue that because of ALS's deadly nature, the possible risks shouldn't stop a potential therapy from being deployed quickly. On the other hand, Dr. Gage says, given the current worries about gene therapy, he and others are moving very deliberately toward clinical trials, to be conducted by Johns Hopkins.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Here, the mood remains optimistic about the prospect that gene therapy will combat disease. "I think it's going to take a long time," says Mr. Kaspar. "But I have great hope."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors in New York yesterday made the first attempt to treat Parkinson's disease with gene therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a four-hour surgical procedure at the Weill Cornell Medical College, a 55-year-old man, suffering from the degenerative brain disorder, underwent an operation in which the therapy was administered to his brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers won approval to conduct the trial last year from the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rights to the technology are owned by a biotechnology company, Neurologix Inc., Fort Lee, N.J., but it wasn't involved in yesterday's experiment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The patient, producer Nathan Klein of New York's Long Island, was alert and doing well late yesterday. About 1.5 million Americans, and 10 million world-wide, suffer from Parkinson's, which affects people's ability to control their movements.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drugs can treat the early stages of the disease by increasing levels of the brain-chemical dopamine. But such treatments become less effective as the disease progresses.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gene-therapy experiment was led by Michael Kaplitt of Cornell and Matthew During of the University of Auckland in New Zealand. The surgery involved inserting viruses engineered to contain a gene called GAD, for glutamic acid decarboxylase.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once inside the brain, the gene produces a chemical called GABA, which calms overactive nerve cells in the brains of Parkinson's patients. Dr. Kaplitt said the goal of the procedure was "to re-establish the normal neurochemistry" of the brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The attempt to treat Parkinson's opens a new front for gene therapy in the brain, where scientists say the technology offers new ways to precisely control brain chemistry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Cornell researchers said they planned to treat 12 patients in all, at three different doses. The next surgery will take place this fall, Dr. Kaplitt said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two other companies, Ceregene Inc. of San Diego, a majority-owned subsidiary of Cell Genesys Inc., of South San Francisco, Calif., and Oxford Biomedica PLC of the United Kingdom each said they hoped to launch their own studies of Parkinson's gene therapy by the middle of next year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No gene therapy has ever been commercialized, although prior human and animal studies have demonstrated that it can work. Several hundred clinical trials have been approved over the last decade, mostly focused on cancer.</p>

</div><div class="author">By Antonio Regalado </div><div>482 words</div><div>8 August 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This week, scientists have opened a promising front against amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, the neurological disease that killed baseball great Lou Gehrig at age 37. In a study, researchers report that a gene-therapy treatment can extend the lives of laboratory mice with an ALS-like condition by 20%.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment marks the first time gene therapy has proved effective against the condition, said Jeffrey Rothstein, an ALS researcher at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, who along with scientists at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., presented the findings in today's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rothstein says a human test of the genetic treatment is being planned. The researchers hope to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration to begin a preliminary study of a similar treatment in patients within a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALS kills motor neuron cells that connect the spinal cord to the body's muscles, causing paralysis and death when breathing becomes impossible.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About 30,000 people in the U.S. have been diagnosed with the illness, for which there is no cure. According to the Muscular Dystrophy Association, the drug Riluzole is the only approved treatment, but doctors call it of limited use. Because of such factors, Dr. Rothstein said, "we think [the FDA] will let us go to trial a lot faster than usual."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work was funded by the National Institutes of Health, the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation and Project ALS, a charity in New York City formed by three sisters, one of whom has ALS. Valerie Estess, a founder of the group, said it may spend as much as several million dollars to underwrite tests of the treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cell Genesys Inc., of South San Francisco, Calif., said its majority-owned subsidiary Ceregene Inc., of San Diego, had negotiated an option to take exclusive commercial rights to the treatment. The companies have close ties with gene-therapy expert Fred Gage, who led the work at the Salk Institute.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy uses viruses to add genetic instructions to cells. The Salk researchers infected the muscles of mice suffering from an ALS-like condition with a virus containing a gene called IGF-1, which is known to counteract chemical signals that cause cells to die. The treated animals lived about 25 to 40 days longer than untreated ones, which died after about 120 days.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctored virus is able to travel into nerve cells inside the spinal cord, an area normally difficult to reach. "In terms of feasibility, this is a very important finding," said Serge Przedborski, a neuroscientist at Columbia University in New York.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy still faces some obstacles. Serious side effects in other studies have heightened concerns over the technology, which has yet to prove commercially successful. </p>

<div id="hd" ><b class='enHeadline'>FDA Halts Trials Of Gene Therapy As Child Falls Ill</b>
</div><div class="author">By Chris Adams </div><div>629 words</div><div>15 January 2003</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>D3</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 2003, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration halted more than two dozen gene-therapy trials after a second child treated in a French "bubble boy" disease experiment developed a leukemia-like condition, another setback for a field trying to regroup from the death of a teenage gene-therapy subject in 1999.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, a child in what had been considered a successful gene-therapy trial was diagnosed with the leukemia-like illness, prompting the halt of three similar studies in the U.S. The event was treated as an anomaly, an adverse reaction that scientists knew was theoretically possible but deemed far-fetched.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with a second illness, the FDA said the scientific community needs to come together to understand what is causing the ailments. In the interim, the FDA put what is known as a clinical hold on 27 additional studies that execute gene therapy in the same manner as the French trial -- using retroviruses to insert new genes in blood stem cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The actions last fall and yesterday bring to 30 the number of U.S. trials that have been halted, out of about 200 that are listed as active by the FDA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In October, we knew we had a promising therapy that had an adverse event that was serious, but we didn't know whether it was a one-in-a-million occurrence, or something else," said Phil Noguchi, an FDA official who oversees the field. "Now, we have a second leukemia."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment involved less than a dozen children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDA will hold an advisory committee meeting late next month to explore the issue, trying to determine if the disease being treated, the technique being used, the viral vector being used, or some other factor is causing the illnesses. "We need to understand what not to do," said Dr. Noguchi.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The children in France suffered from an immunodeficiency condition popularly known as the bubble boy disease. Early results of the French study, in which a normal gene was inserted into blood stem cells, showed that a majority of the children treated had promising results and could leave the hospital to lead relatively normal lives, the FDA said. The two children suffering from the leukemia-like condition have been treated with apparent success by chemotherapy, the FDA said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The American Society of Gene Therapy said it supported the FDA's action, which it said was necessary to help the field undertake a comprehensive review of the particular type of retrovirus experiments. The society also urged caution among researchers conducting such experiments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're distressed that a second event has occurred," said Joseph Glorioso, the group's president and a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. "I think the second event is a bigger setback, since these adverse events are far more frequent than anyone would have anticipated."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the related trials are now on clinical hold, the FDA said it would keep the door open to some experiments treating patients who have fatal or life-threatening disorders for which there are no viable alternative treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All 30 trials now under the microscope will likely be halted until at least after the FDA's meeting on the issue late next month.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While gene therapy once had great promise, it has failed to live up to expectations. In 1999, an Arizona teenager died while participating in an experiment, briefly bringing the field to its knees as researchers reassessed the risks involved in the cutting-edge treatments. The French trial was one that had helped revive the field, as its findings showed the potential of gene therapy to correct an otherwise fatal disorder. </p>

Gene Therapy Bolsters Weak Heart

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
CHICAGO -- Researchers reported more progress in efforts to use gene
therapy to help heart patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a trial involving 71 patients with severe chest pain called angina,
injecting a gene into the heart muscle prompted patients to grow their
own blood vessels to bypass obstructed arteries in the heart. Moreover,
the blood-vessel growth led six months later to a significant increase
in the time patients were able to walk on a treadmill before triggering
chest pain and other symptoms.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The findings add to an emerging body of evidence that gene therapy can
help restore blood flow to areas of the heart where the supply has been
severely restricted by blockages in the coronary arteries. For the 36
patients who got the treatment, exercise time six months later was
extended by an average of 1.1 minutes, or 28%, over such tests before
they were treated. About one-third of patients were able to extend their
treadmill-test time by more than three minutes. The 35 patients in the
control group were treated with medications and didn't significantly
improve on their treadmill performance.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Duncan Stewart, head of cardiology at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto,
said the additional exercise time translates into meaningful
improvements in daily lives of patients, all of whom were suffering from
intractable chest pain but weren't candidates for bypass surgery or
artery-clearing angioplasty treatments. He presented the findings at the
annual scientific sessions of the American Heart Association here.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study was sponsored by GenVec Inc., Gaithersburg, Md., which is
developing the treatment using a gene for vascular endothelial growth
factor, or VEGF. The gene was delivered via an inactivated virus called
an adenovirus through an incision in patients' chests. Two patients
given the treatment during the study died, compared with one in the
control group. Dr. Stewart said the deaths among gene-therapy patients
were related to the surgical procedure used to open the chest to deliver
the treatment rather than the treatment itself.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GenVec and other companies developing similar gene-therapy approaches
are beginning to test methods in which the gene is injected via a
catheter threaded into the heart. That would eliminate complications
related to surgery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Augustus Grant, president-elect of the American Heart Association and
professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, Durham, N.C.,
said the new report suggests the gene treatment is working but calls for
development of less-invasive ways to deliver it to patients.

Gene Therapy
For Parkinson's
Is Set for Trial
</b>
</div><div class="author">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE FIRST clinical trials of gene therapy to treat patients with
Parkinson's disease are expected to be under way by the end of this year
-- on the heels of new fears about using genes to treat diseases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers, who will conduct the Parkinson's trials at New York
Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Medical College of Cornell University, have
a go-ahead from a National Institutes of Health review panel that
oversees gene-therapy trials, the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, as
well as Food and Drug Administration approval.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That approval came before news last week that scientists in France and
the U.S. had suspended studies of a gene-therapy approach that appears
to cure a rare immune disorder dubbed "bubble boy disease" after a
French patient developed a leukemia-like condition.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yesterday, at a special FDA meeting called to discuss the boy's
illness, government advisers agreed that the gene therapy probably made
the French boy ill but said the risks weren't high enough to justify
stopping the experiments for children with the often fatal disease. They
also urged that parents and patients be warned about the risk of
retroviruses -- the kind used in the French toddler's case. The concerns
are reminiscent of the regulatory scrutiny and soul-searching that
followed the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger in a 1999 gene-therapy
trial at the University of Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Parkinson's researchers say they believe their trial will be safe.
They have revised their clinical models and safety protocol several
times, once at the request of the influential NIH review panel. They
have conducted five sets of tests in rats and a safety-test in seven
primates. In a paper published today in the journal Science, they said
the genes, inserted into viruses and injected into rats, appeared to
slow the progression of the disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, the researchers know they are venturing into a controversial
area. When they sought clearance from the NIH committee, "people openly
expressed surprise that this idea came to the panel," said Michael
Kaplitt, one of the Weill researchers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
More than 10 million people world-wide, including 1.5 million
Americans, are estimated to suffer from Parkinson's disease, a
degenerative neurological disorder that causes impaired movement and
other symptoms. Researchers believe Parkinson's is caused when nerve
cells that produce the brain chemical dopamine degenerate. The loss of
dopamine causes a terrible cascade of neural events, centering in the
subthalamic nucleus region and leading to an inability to control body
movements. Patients suffer a progressive loss of motor functions,
experiencing trembling, rigid muscles, slowed motion and a loss of
facial expression.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists are investigating numerous possible causes and cures for
the disease, which research is showing may develop through environmental
or genetic causes depending on the type. One of the most widely used
surgical treatments for Parkinson's is the deep-brain stimulation
technique, which involves inserting an electronic probe into the brain
to quiet the subthalamic-nucleus region. "Stimulation works but still
has its downsides," Dr. Kaplitt says. "There is lots of hardware on the
body," he adds, referring to electrodes and batteries among other
stimulation necessities.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Kaplitt and a senior research partner, Matthew During of the
University of Auckland in New Zealand, hope the gene-therapy technique
will provide a better alternative to deep-brain stimulation. The
gene-therapy surgery involves inserting the GAD (for glutamic acid
decarboxylase) gene into a nonpathogenic class of viruses, called the
adeno-associated virus, or AAV. The injected virus delivers the gene
into cells in the affected area of the brain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The GAD gene produces a brain chemical called GABA, which is released
by nerve cells to calm them down. The therapy works on the nerve cells
in the subthalamic nucleus region that have become overactive due to a
lack of dopamine.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers say their animal study, in addition to quieting
symptoms of the disease, indicates the therapy could arrest or delay
disease progression. They are now awaiting final approval from a
hospital review board before beginning the small clinical trial, which
was approved by the FDA Aug. 2. It would involve six-hour surgeries and
about two years of periodic monitoring of the 12 human patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All the patients are younger than 65, are advanced cases that have had
the disease for at least five years and are being selected through North
Shore-Long Island Jewish Health System in New York. "In the worst
scenario possible, they would just revert back to the deep-brain
stimulation treatment," says David Eidelberg, head of neuroscience at
North Shore, who is working with the researchers. "Patients are not
deprived of the alternative."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Joseph Glorioso, a physician at the University of Pittsburgh School of
Medicine and president of the American Society of Gene Therapy, says,
"I'm certainly in favor of testing because these patients have no other
options. He adds: "I'm not skeptical or enthusiastic. I just don't have
any idea how it is going to come out."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
William Langston, a physician and president of the Parkinson's
Institute in Sunnyvale, Calif., describes the new gene therapy as
interesting and promising, yet untested with a "long way to go."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"These studies are always risky," says Theodore Friedmann, a
gene-therapy expert at the University of California, San Diego, and the
chairman of the NIH's RAC committee. Dr. Friedmann confirms this is the
first such project involving Parkinson's disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Amy Patterson, the physician who is director of the office of
Biotechnology Activities at the NIH, says researchers have submitted
nearly 550 gene-therapy proposals in humans to the NIH for review,
starting with one in 1988 and 73 last year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The two main Parkinson's gene-therapy researchers have formed a
private Delaware-based company, Neurologix, that has raised about $2.5
million for research, including a large investment from Medtronic Inc.,
and intends to raise at least $500,000 a year to complete the trials.

WASHINGTON -- Scientists in France and the U.S. suspended studies of a
gene therapy that appears to cure the rare immune disorder dubbed
"bubble boy disease," after a French boy developed a leukemia-like side
effect.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is unclear if the gene therapy actually caused the boy's illness
and, if so, how often such a side effect might occur.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The three-year-old French boy received gene therapy during his first
month of life that worked well. But during late summer his body suddenly
overproduced white blood cells, a reaction doctors called leukemia-like.
He is responding well to chemotherapy, scientists said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nine other children given the same gene therapy at Paris' Necker
Hospital are doing well, and no other children world-wide given gene
therapy for this disease -- severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID --
have ever shown such a side effect.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Food and Drug Administration's scientific advisers will evaluate
the development, in consultation with the scientists from Paris, at a
meeting next week to determine what additional research or precautions
are needed before the gene-therapy studies can resume.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SCID is an inherited disease that occurs in about one in 75,000
births. Patients' bodies don't make certain proteins crucial to
developing disease-fighting immune cells. Without any treatment, SCID
patients die very young.

New Gene Therapy
Halts Progression
Of Heart Failure

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a potentially important advance for gene therapy, researchers said
they have developed a novel gene and a system for delivering it to the
heart that successfully halted progression of severe heart failure in
laboratory animals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If the results are borne out in further experiments, now under way at
the University of California at San Diego, initial tests in people could
begin in 12 to 18 months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The research, being published today in the journal Nature Medicine,
could provide a boost to the field of gene therapy, which has been
struggling in the aftermath of both a highly publicized death of a
patient and several studies that for the most part have yielded limited
benefit for patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the new study, led by Kenneth Chien, director of the Institute of
Molecular Medicine at UCSD, researchers succeeded in penetrating about
60% of the targeted cells with their therapeutic gene in hamsters bred
to develop progressive heart failure. In the 30 hamsters that got the
gene, heart function improved significantly over the seven-month study,
compared with 28 that weren't treated.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This is a technical tour de force," said Elizabeth Nabel, scientific
director for clinical research at the National Institute of Health's
National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, who wasn't involved in the
study. "The key to gene therapy in the heart is to get a gene in the
majority of [targeted] heart cells."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Typically, in studies of gene treatments to promote growth of blood
vessels in patients with diseased arteries, scientists have been able to
get the gene to take root in only a small percentage of cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Heart failure afflicts more than 4.5 million Americans. It occurs
when, as a result of a heart attack, high blood pressure or other
causes, the heart muscle becomes too weak to pump blood effectively to
the lungs and the rest of the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In their experiments, Dr. Chien and his colleagues focused on a gene
for a protein called phospholamban, which acts as a brake on a pump that
delivers calcium to heart-muscle cells. Calcium triggers contraction of
the heart; its availability in appropriate amounts is crucial to the
strength of each heart beat. In patients with heart failure, the
phospholamban brake "is on too tight," Dr. Chien said, and the heart's
pumping ability deteriorates. The researchers fashioned a mutant form of
the phospholamban gene to replace the dysfunctional normal gene --
hoping to restore normal function of the brake.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other gene-therapy experiments have used a deactivated adenovirus -- a
cause of the common cold -- to deliver genes, with limited success. The
Chien team chose instead a cousin known as an adeno-associated virus,
which provoked a much lower immune-system response from the hamsters,
one reason the researchers believe they were successful in reaching so
many cells. Treated hamsters had improved heartbeats and their disease
didn't progress.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"These results suggest that you can influence the course of a chronic
disease such as heart failure with a single delivery" of gene therapy,
Dr. Chien said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study was supported by the Jean Leducq Foundation, a private
philanthropy.

THREE YEARS AFTER an 18-year-old volunteer died in a gene-therapy
trial, chastened scientists are coming up with cautious, and more
realistic, ways of using genes as drugs against a host of tough-to-treat
problems, such as the acute pain caused by cancer, arthritis or
diabetes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A flurry of emerging research, largely in laboratory animals, suggests
that treating people by implanting genes into the body will likely work
best in a supporting, rather than a starring role. In these new efforts,
gene therapy is being used to enhance, for example, existing cancer care
rather than providing a wholly new approach to fighting tumors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Until 1999, many gene-therapy enthusiasts gushed about the promise of
treating -- even curing -- disease by inserting into patients healthy
genes to replace the malfunctioning ones. But in September of that year,
a relatively robust Jesse Gelsinger died unexpectedly during an
experiment at the University of Pennsylvania to treat a rare genetic
liver disorder he had since birth. His death was the first in the dozens
of human gene-therapy trials since the first patient experiment in 1990.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The young man's death stirred an intense backlash because the
experiment was carried out by a pioneering research team at Penn. An
investigation found that the researchers failed to notify subjects of
side effects seen in primate tests. Subsequent assessments showed  many
gene-therapy studies produced more toxicity than expected with little
sustained effectiveness.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Joseph Glorioso, a researcher at the University of Pittsburgh Medical
Center, is part of a growing group of scientists who believe
gene-therapy enthusiasts set themselves up for failure by trying to foil
very tough diseases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We've got to take a much more practical approach," Dr. Glorioso told
me during a recent visit to his office.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In late June, Dr. Glorioso's research team at Pitt will seek
government approval to use a new type of gene therapy to treat
terminally ill bone-cancer patients suffering pain resistant even to
morphine. If approved, it will be the first gene-therapy trial designed
not to "cure a disease, but to treat a condition that is a result of
disease," Dr. Glorioso says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, Dr. Glorioso's experiment is certain to stir up concerns.
That's because he plans to use a laboratory-mutated version of a herpes
virus, somewhat akin to the bug that causes genital herpes, to literally
carry a set of pain-defusing genes to nerves being damaged by the
cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The idea, he argues, isn't nearly as radical as it at first sounds.
All gene therapy is grounded in the discovery made that viruses that
normally cause illness can be exploited to transport genes into human
cells. That's what viruses do. When we get infected by influenza, the
virus makes us sick by invading a lung cell, inserting its collection of
genes into the cell's nucleus, and forcing the cell to make new copies
of the virus. These viral particles then furiously multiply by
colonizing other cells, and so on until our immune system fights back.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In most gene-therapy efforts, scientists stitch desired genes into
viruses whose ability to replicate has been removed. In trying to cure
cystic fibrosis, researchers inserted a healthy copy of the defective
gene that causes the respiratory illness into a defanged common cold
virus. Since the virus normally infects lung cells, it is able to ferry
the healthy gene. However, because the gene-bearing virus needed to be
administered for a long time, the patients' immune systems eventually
saw it as foreign.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new strategy requires only short-term exposures to the virus at
much lower doses than used in the past. Dr. Glorioso is utilizing the
herpes virus because it naturally targets nerve cells. To the virus,
which has had its duplicating machinery removed, the Pitt team has added
a gene that makes a protein called enkephalin. This protein naturally
works by blocking pain signals emitted from damaged nerve cells. In this
new vision, the herpes virus is simply a way of delivering a potent
painkiller to the site where it is needed most.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Studies in laboratory rats have shown this technique can significantly
dull pain response. In addition, the rats didn't develop the tolerance
that normally occurs after continued  narcotics use. "Our hope is that
the therapy will reduce the need for morphine, prolonging its
effectiveness," Dr. Glorioso says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As incoming president of the American Society of Gene Therapy, Dr.
Glorioso hopes to help to persuade his colleagues to pursue other
practical approaches. For instance, Dr. Glorioso points out that some
genes could be delivered to the site of a cancer, making some tumors
more vulnerable to radiation and chemotherapy. Other genes could be used
to protect cells near a cancer, allowing doctors to use higher doses of
cancer drugs. Genes that grow blood vessels could be inserted into heart
muscle during bypass surgery to strengthen damaged hearts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Trying to cure diabetes or hemophilia was just too high a bar," Dr.
Glorioso maintains, noting that when it comes to gene therapy, less
might accomplish more these days.

Gene Therapy Benefits 4 Sick Boys
</b>
</div><div class="author">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In an important coup for DNA-based medicine, French scientists report
that they successfully used gene therapy in four boys to correct a
genetic defect that causes a devastating immune deficiency.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study is the strongest indication yet that DNA-repairing
techniques can permanently fix an inherited disease. Researchers refrain
from calling it a cure, until they see whether the effects last over
time.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study tested the technique on five infants suffering from severe
combined immunodeficiency, or SCID, a rare disease that leaves them
unable to fight off infections. A medical consortium based in Paris
reports today in the New England Journal of Medicine that it was able to
correct the genetic defect in four of the five young boys by using a
virus to shuttle a normal gene into their bone marrow. Preliminary
results of the researchers' work were published in 2000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technology of gene therapy has faced many hurdles, and so far has
met with limited success when tested in humans. Ricardo Sorensen, a
pediatric immunologist at Louisiana State University's Health Sciences
Center in New Orleans, who has a patient who was treated in the study,
said, "At this point, he looks cured, though you can never tell how long
it will last."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Sorensen says his patient, Damian Rodriguez, now 2 1/2 years old,
"is leading an unrestricted life at home with his parents and his
brother."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The plight of children with SCID was popularized in the John Travolta
film "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble," about a boy in Texas who lived for
several years in a sterile environment. Girls also can get the disease,
but it is more common in males because one form is transmitted via the
maternal X chromosome.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Children promptly diagnosed with the disease no longer need to live in
a closed environment. About 80% of cases are curable with a transplant
of donor bone marrow, which can restore the ability to make
infection-fighting blood cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In fact, Damian's older brother, Austin, also had SCID, says Dr.
Sorensen, but he was treated with blood-forming stem cells from his
father. "Gene therapy is not the only treatment available," says Dr.
Sorensen. "But it will enrich our choices when it becomes available."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many observers say gene therapy moved too quickly from the laboratory
into clinical trials, and the field suffered a serious setback with the
death in 1999 of a study volunteer at the University of Pennsylvania
named Jesse Gelsinger.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, extensive studies continue. As of December, there were 388
active gene-therapy trials under way in the U.S., according to the
National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The findings reported today also could be important to publicly traded
gene-therapy firms, including Cell Genesys Inc., of Foster City, Calif.;
and Valentis Inc. of Burlingame, Calif. German pharmaceutical giant
Schering AG recently agreed to acquire a third player in the sector,
Collateral Therapeutics Inc.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rather than attempt to treat rare conditions such as immune
deficiencies, corporate efforts have targeted cancer and common blood
disorders such as hemophilia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Gene therapy is where antibodies were five or six years ago -- before
the first product but where things are showing some promise," said John
McCamant, an analyst with the Medical Technology Stock Letter in New
York. Cell Genesys, for instance, has a cancer treatment called GVAX
that is scheduled to enter Phase III clinical trials this year.

Gene Therapy

In Heart Studies

Shows Promise

New Blood Vessels Grow;

Blood Flow Is Restored

To the Damaged Muscle

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ANAHEIM, Calif. -- Researchers reported the most promising evidence

yet that gene therapy can help patients grow new blood vessels and

restore blood flow to damaged heart muscle.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a trial involving 19 patients, scientists said those who were

injected with a gene for a growth factor that triggers the development

of blood vessels reported less chest pain and improved exercise capacity

compared with patients given a placebo solution that didn't contain the

gene. Other more objective measures indicated that patients who got the

gene therapy had increased blood flow to the heart muscle.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, other researchers reported progress in using adult stem

cells to regenerate heart muscle and improve the heart's ability to pump

blood.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Both strategies are on the vanguard of a new generation of treatments

that heart experts hope will help patients overcome the consequences of

severe heart disease and improve the function of their hearts. But both

are in the early stages of clinical development, and researchers

cautioned that much work remains to be done to determine whether the

therapies will ultimately reach the market and prove helpful to

patients.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We are really in the infancy of these techniques," said Patrick

Serruys, a researcher from Rotterdam who is working on stem-cell

research. Both studies were presented at the annual Scientific Sessions

of the American Heart Association here.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gene-therapy study is the first randomized trial to evaluate the

effectiveness of injecting a gene for a growth factor known as VEGF-2,

or vascular endothelial growth factor-2, directly into the heart to

induce the growth of blood vessels. Several earlier studies had prompted

excitement about the technique, but because they lacked a control group,

it wasn't clear whether the gene treatment provided a benefit or whether

patients felt better because they knew they had been treated -- a

phenomenon known as the placebo effect.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the new study, "patients who got the active treatment got better,

patients who got placebo didn't get better," said Douglas L. Losordo,

director, cardiac catheterization laboratories, at St. Elizabeth's

Medical Center and an author the report.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers used a catheter threaded into the heart through a vessel

in the groin to deliver the VEGF-2 or a placebo to the heart tissue. At

follow up after three months, patients who got the growth factor

reported less severe angina, significantly lower use of nitroglycerin to

control the pain, and a substantial increase in their ability to

exercise on a treadmill.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a companion report, Peter Vale of St. Vincent's Hospital, Sydney

Australia, said a special mapping device that can identify areas of the

heart muscle that are normal, deprived of oxygen, or scarred, showed

that patients given the medicine had increased motion of the wall of the

heart, an indication that its functioning had improved. Placebo patients

didn't experience similar improvement.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The data are provocative, and they certainly are encouraging, but

they're not definitive," Dr. Losordo said.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study was sponsored in part by Vascular Genetics Inc., a Waltham

Mass., start-up that  licensed the VEGF-2 from Human Genome Sciences

Inc., Rockville, Md. Stephen A. Sohn, chief executive, said the company

is in discussions with the Food and Drug Administration to start a major

trial of the technique. It hopes to be able to file an application by

the fourth quarter of 2003 seeking approval of the treatment.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gene-therapy strategy was pioneered by Jeffrey Isner, a

researcher at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center and Tufts University,

Boston, who died suddenly of a heart attack about two weeks ago. He was

remembered by his colleagues as a passionate leader and investigator

whose patients were the beneficiary of his efforts.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Two reports on stem-cell therapy added to the limited but growing

evidence that adult stem cells might be enlisted to repair the damage to

the heart muscle caused by a heart attack. The weakened muscle

compromises the ability of the heart to pump blood effectively for many

patients, leading to a debilitating condition known as congestive heart

failure.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Philippe Menache, a researcher at Hospital Bichat, Paris, reported on

the experience of seven patients who were injected with muscle stem

cells harvested from their own thighs and injected into scarred sections

of the heart pumping chamber during bypass surgery.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A total of 18 sections of heart tissue were treated with the stem

cells, he said, and a subsequent analysis indicated tissue that had

previously been moribund began contracting again -- an indication that

new muscle cells had taken hold and were functioning. Whether the

technique is actually leading to the improvement isn't certain since it

is possible that the concurrent bypass operation could explain why heart

muscle would function better.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Dr. Serruys reported on a single patient who got the stem-cell

treatment via a catheter and didn't have bypass surgery or any other

treatment. Initial findings indicate that the patient's ejection

fraction, a measure of how much blood the heart pumps out during a beat,

improved to 45% from about 39%. Other measures supported the idea that

the patient benefited from the treatment.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Serruys' work was supported by Bioheart Inc., a closely held Fort

Lauderdale, Fla., start-up that hopes to begin testing the treatment on

U.S. patients early next year, with researchers at Mt. Sinai Medical

Center, New York, heading the study.

Gene Therapy
Gets Boost From
Hemophiliac Test
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Laura Johannes
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>1092 words</div><div>7 June 2001</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An unusual new type of gene therapy boosted levels of clotting factor
in the blood of a small number of hemophiliacs, allowing two severely
ill patients to live 10 months without spontaneous bleeding, Harvard
University researchers found.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study results, published in today's New England Journal of
Medicine, are far from the kind of proof needed to take the therapy to
market. In particular, it isn't clear if the salutory effect lasts long
enough to make the procedure practical. But the finding feeds the
reviving hopes that gene therapy, written off by many scientists as a
miserable failure, may yet work.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In gene therapy, healthy copies of genes are inserted into the body
to correct problems caused by defective or missing genes. Alarm over the
procedure's safety rose after the death of an 18-year-old patient at the
University of Pennsylvania in 1999. But since then, preliminary
successes have been seen in treating children with a rare immune-system
disorder, and in some forms of cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The hemophilia research team, which includes Boston's Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center and Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. of Cambridge,
Mass., is the second group of scientists in recent months to offer hope
that the nation's 17,000 hemophiliacs may one day live normal lives.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There's no doubt in my mind that gene therapy is going to cure
hemophilia. It's just a question of when," says Mark A. Kay, who heads
the gene-therapy program at Stanford University. Dr. Kay, part of a team
that recently used a different gene-therapy method to get promising
early results in hemophilia B, an unusual form of the disease, adds,
"It's not clear which approach will ultimately prove best."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hemophilia is widely believed to be one of the easiest targets for
gene therapy, and at least a dozen U.S. teams are working on it. The
disease, while devastating, has a very simple cause: Due to a genetic
defect, its victims lack one or more of the blood components that aid
clotting. As a result, they face danger from relatively small cuts and
are plagued with continual bleeding, which often occurs in the joints
even without injury.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since the 1970s, the availability of injectible clotting factors has
dramatically improved the lives of hemophiliacs. But the medications
have been no panacea. Many hemophiliacs contracted the AIDS virus from
the injections, which were made from human blood. Even today, with safer
products available, high cost limits their use primarily to stanching
heavy bleeding after it occurs, rather than preventing it. A single shot
to counter bleeding from a banged elbow could cost $2,000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Recently, a shortage of medication, caused in part by bacterial
contamination at a major U.S. plant, has forced patients to forgo shots
for minor bleeds. "What little I have in my refrigerator I am saving for
major events," says Mark Skinner, president of the National Hemophilia
Foundation, a nonprofit advocacy group.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Boston research, begun in 1998, was the first that attempted to
use genes to treat hemophilia A, which affects 80% of hemophiliacs. The
research also uses an unusual new approach, which scientists hope will
resolve longstanding problems with traditional gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Typically, a therapeutic gene is inserted into a virus, such as one
that causes colds, and the virus is injected into the patient. The hope
is that the virus -- which has been stripped of its disease-causing
components -- will infect cells, and thus transmit the healthy gene to
them. However, many experiments failed when patients' bodies mounted a
defense against the virus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's a vexing circumstance," says Francis Collins, head of the U.S.
National Institutes of Health's genome program. "How do you get
efficient gene delivery in the face of an immune system that is
basically designed to prevent intruders?"
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the approach devised by Transkaryotic, which funded the study,
scientists seek to disarm these defenses by using the patients' own
cells as a sort of Trojan horse to deliver the genes. A small clump of
skin cells are removed from the patients' arms with a scalpel. Then,
using a patented method, the company inserts the desired gene into the
cells. The altered cells are then implanted, in a one-hour operation,
through a small incision into the fat of the patients' abdomen. Once
there, they serve as a tiny manufacturing plant for Factor Eight, the
clotting protein missing in patients with hemophilia A.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The New England Journal study was primarily designed to test the
safety of the procedure, and researchers, out of caution, inserted cells
making only small amounts of the clotting protein. Still, the outcome,
in addition to demonstrating the procedure's safety, included a
surprising amount of therapeutic effect: Four of the six patients saw
significant increases in their levels of clotting factors for several
months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Two who kept detailed diaries reported that they were able to go
weeks or months without drugs, and 10 months without spontaneous
bleeding. The most visible effect was seen in one of these two patients,
who received the cells producing the highest level of clotting protein.
In the year before the treatment, he had experienced spontaneous
bleeding once or twice a week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Unfortunately, this patient's spontaneous bleedings resumed after
that, leaving him back where he started. "This could be a major
technical obstacle, since the procedure is so cumbersome it's not
something you can do every four to six months," says Stanford's Dr. Kay.
A more traditional virus-delivery method used in his study, a team
effort with Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, had very modest
effects, but one patient appears to be making some clotting factor two
years after treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Boston study's lead author, David A. Roth, an assistant professor
of medicine at Harvard and head of hemophilia research at Beth Israel
Deaconess, says scientists can probably produce a longer-term effect by
engineering the cells to produce greater quantities of the clotting
factor, and by implanting more cells into the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Transkaryotic hopes its technology, if it proves its mettle in
hemophilia, will have wide applications, from giving diabetics a steady
supply of insulin to correcting high-blood cholesterol. "There are a
large number of other diseases that will follow," says Transkaryotic
founder and Chief Executive Richard Selden. "But it's important to make
sure we are cautious. In gene therapy, if you move too quickly, you can
hit roadblocks."

Gene-Therapy Patients
Need Longer Follow-Up,
FDA Advisers Say

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
BETHESDA, Md. (Reuters) -- Participants in some gene therapy trials
should be closely followed for as long as 20 years after a study's
completion to guard against future complications, a U.S. advisory group
said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Currently, only organ-transplant recipients are monitored that long,
but the Food and Drug Administration advisers said so little was known
about the long-term consequences of gene therapy that it was better to
err on the side of caution.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 1999 death of Jesse Gelsinger, 18 years old, during treatment for
an inherited liver disorder led the FDA to tighten its oversight of
genetic research. The FDA had asked the advisory panel to review whether
new reporting and monitoring requirements set by the agency were
adequate to protect patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a second and final day of discussions, the panel also said that
giving the public more information about continuing trials involving
gene therapy was a good idea, although a balance was needed between the
public's need for reassurance and industry's desire to protect
proprietary information. Last week, the panel said it supported
independent monitors for gene-therapy studies. The FDA usually follows
the advice of its advisory panels. Panel Chairman Daniel Salomon, a
professor at the Scripps Research Institute, in La Jolla, Calif.,
acknowledged the public's grave concerns about the safety of gene
therapy or any genetic engineering, and said the panel should act to
reassure Americans by insisting on long-term follow-up.

Human Genome Sciences Inc. of Rockville, Md., is expected to announce
today that Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd., Japan's largest drug
company, will pursue about 100 potential drug-development targets that
could lead to milestone and royalty payments for HGS. These targets
resulted from genes uncovered by HGS and may lead to conventional
medicines and antibody-based therapies for diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, bone and joint disease, central-nervous-system disorders and
other illnesses of interest to Takeda. Takeda is one of five drug
companies that joined a human gene-finding consortium started by HGS in
1993. Under terms of their agreement, HGS is entitled to milestone and
royalty payments on products Takeda develops from genetic information
supplied by HGS. Takeda would make milestone payments to HGS as the
drugs are clinically tested; the companies didn't disclose their size.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If the medicines make it to market, HGS would collect royalties equal to
"middle to high single digit" percentages of sales, HGS Chairman and
Chief Executive William Haseltine said. HGS rose 50 cents to $43.69 a
share at 4 p.m. in Nasdaq Stock Market trading.

Gene-Therapy
Panelists Urge
More Reporting

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- A National Institutes of Health panel proposed beefing
up reporting on the field of gene therapy, outraging
biotechnology-industry advocates who say their right to keep trade
information secret would be trampled.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The agency's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee voted 11-0, with one
abstention, to boost the amount of data gene-therapy researchers have to
submit to the NIH and to create a new safety-monitoring board. The
proposal now goes to the NIH's acting director, Ruth Kirschstein, who
will decide whether to act on it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene-therapy research has been under a cloud since the 1999 death of
an Arizona teenager in a gene-therapy experiment and subsequent
revelations that researchers weren't properly reporting safety
information to the NIH. While researchers complained that the reporting
guidelines were confusing, the NIH began a series of meetings that
resulted in yesterday's vote.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The just-passed proposal would require the vast majority of
gene-therapy researchers to report to the NIH "serious adverse events"
that are unexpected and possibly related to the gene therapy. In
addition, researchers would have to submit annual reports on
experiments, and include such information as the doses being used, the
number of patients enrolled, and the status of the experiment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That information would be funneled to a new NIH Gene Transfer Safety
Assessment Board, and would be publicly available in all but
"exceptional circumstances." Such information is not now publicly
released by the Food and Drug Administration, which also oversees the
field, although that agency also has a proposal to make some of it
public.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The information would allow for "the identification of risky trends"
and provide "a greater sense of comfort on the part of the public that
nothing is being held back," said committee member Jon Gordon, a
professor at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Officials in the biotechnology industry, however, strongly argued
against the proposal. The Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade
group based here, said the "disclosure of serious adverse event reports
and annual reports . . . could cause substantial competitive harm" to
companies sponsoring gene-therapy work.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Dose-response information could tell the competitor which dose
levels work and which do not," the group said in comments submitted to
the NIH. Such information could allow a competitor "to duplicate a
company's work without the same expenditure of time and money."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The group also said the NIH was overstepping its authority and
duplicating the more established role of the FDA.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Researchers believe the death of an Arizona
teenager in a botched gene-therapy experiment was caused by a massive
immune system reaction associated with a protein used in the study.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
University of Pennsylvania scientists say the protein was intended to
carry new genes into Jesse Gelsinger's damaged liver, but instead
triggered an immune-system response that led to a coma and organ
failure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tests in monkeys suggest that the immune system tried to destroy the
foreign protein so much that it ended up eliminating proteins that cause
blood to clot.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger's Sept. 17, 1999, death, the first known to have been
caused by gene therapy, resulted in a lawsuit against the university and
potential action by the Food and Drug Administration against lead
researcher James M. Wilson.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Wilson, director of Penn's Institute for Human Gene Therapy,
discussed the findings at a closed-door medical symposium attended by
several hundred gene-therapy researchers this month in Snowbird, Utah.

He declined to comment until the findings are published in a medical

FDA Wants to Make Public Data
On Gene-Therapy Clinical Trials
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Chris Adams
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>486 words</div><div>18 January 2001</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B12</div><div>English</div><div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Food and Drug Administration is proposing to make public a host of
information regarding certain clinical trials, prompting the outrage of
biotechnology-industry representatives who say the disclosure goes
against years of FDA practice and could hurt the scientific process.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The proposal deals with clinical trials involving gene therapy and
xenotransplantation, two cutting-edge medical technologies that academic
researchers and biotechnology companies are seeking to study and
commercialize. The proposed rules, which still must be subject to public
comment and a final decision from the incoming Bush administration, are
intended to ensure "greater public confidence" in the technologies, the
FDA said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Both of these technologies hold great promise, but they may also
pose a remote but unique risk to the individuals who have volunteered to
participate in these types of studies," said FDA Commissioner Jane
Henney.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That sentiment was echoed by Ronald G. Crystal, a prominent
gene-therapy researcher at New York Weill Cornell Medical Center and the
founder of a gene-therapy company. "The fact is that gene therapy is
remarkably safe, but the public is concerned because they don't know
that," he said. "The only way we can convince them is through public
disclosure."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA is calling for several pieces of information to be routinely
released on its Web site about gene therapy and xenotransplantation
trials, including product- and patient-safety data, results from
preclinical and clinical trials, reasons for the study and written
informed consent forms.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA action comes more than a year after an 18-year-old Arizona
man died while participating in a gene-therapy trial. That death,
considered the first fatality directly linked to gene therapy, prompted
a wide-ranging review of the regulation of gene therapy. During that
review, federal officials took researchers to task for failing to
properly report patient-safety information.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While much of the information on clinical trials has been open to the
public through a separate oversight process at the National Institutes
of Health, the FDA has for years kept such information secret, in part
out of respect for company trade secrets. Michael Werner, bioethics
counsel for the Biotechnology Industry Organization, said the FDA
proposal is a major deviation from years of "regulation and practice
that said commercially confidential information will remain
confidential. They seem to be trying to reverse that longstanding
policy."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He also said the legal reasoning the FDA used could be applied to
scientific fields outside gene therapy or xenotransplantation. Further,
while some of the information in question already is publicly available
from the NIH, some information the FDA is calling for doesn't
necessarily go to the NIH, he said. Data from clinical trials that are
released can often be misinterpreted, he said, leading to public panic
and, possibly, a drop in participation in medical trials.

Gene Therapy
Curbs Diabetes
In Rodent Test

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
CALGARY, Alberta -- A single injection of a novel gene-therapy
treatment appears to have cured diabetes in rats and mice, according to
Canadian and South Korean researchers, who hope the approach eventually
will work in human diabetes patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Medical researchers at the University of Calgary and Yonsei Medical
School in Seoul say their gene-therapy agent put insulin-dependent
diabetes into extended remission in rats and mice. The short-lived
rodents are showing no signs of diabetes several months after treatment
and haven't developed any side effects, according to Ji-Won Yoon of the
University of Calgary's Faculty of Medicine, who led the reseachers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The promising approach, described this week in the scientific journal
Nature, raises hopes of a cure for hundreds of thousands of diabetes
patients who must regulate their blood sugar with daily insulin
injections. But the research is in early stages and won't be tested in
humans for several years. Gene therapy for other medical conditions has
proved especially difficult to apply in humans and has come under
intense criticism and scrutiny during the past year, following the death
of a young patient in a clinical trial.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Yoon and four other researchers created a genetically engineered
virus to carry modified human genetic material to the livers of rats and
mice whose pancreases were malfunctioning due to diabetes. Once
integrated into liver cells, the foreign genes performed a vital
function that is normally the role of specialized cells in the pancreas:
In response to high blood-glucose levels, they caused the secretion of a
hormone prompting the body to process glucose and reduce blood sugar.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The hormone, known as single-chain insulin analog, isn't found in the
body normally and isn't identical to insulin, the natural hormone
controlling blood sugar in healthy mammals. But the SIA hormone works
the same way as insulin and has a huge advantage over another natural
substance, pro-insulin, that is the direct product of the human and
mammalian insulin genes: While pro-insulin needs several enzymes to
convert it into active insulin, SIA needs no modification to do its
work.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The failure of the gene product to be metabolized into active insulin
is one of several problems that, until now, had foiled attempts to
develop gene-therapy treatments for diabetes, Dr. Yoon said, adding that
he found this problem so tricky to overcome that he almost abandoned the
project.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other pitfalls the researchers appear to have addressed include
failure of inserted genes to function reliably over long periods, as
well as failure of insulin genes to activate when blood sugar is high
and deactivate when glucose levels are low.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To circumvent this last problem, Dr. Yoon and his colleagues
introduced two foreign genes into the livers of their diabetic rodents,
not just one. One of the genes, sensitive to blood sugar, modifies the
action of the second, which is directly responsible for promoting SIA
production.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To address concerns about the safety of the viral carrier, the
researchers chose a virus that in other studies had been shown to be "a
safe and efficient gene-delivery system" that doesn't cause
inflammation. They looked for liver damage in the experimental animals
by performing histological examinations on infected liver tissue and
testing for the presence of marker enzymes for liver damage and for
antibodies to SIA. The examinations revealed no visible cell damage, and
all other tests were negative.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Yoon said the group will continue to monitor the rats and mice
involved in their study until at least a year after treatment. Then they
plan to try the same approach, spanning three to four years, in larger
animals such as dogs or monkeys before ultimately moving to human
trials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Dr. Yoon said he is optimistic that the gene therapy will work in
humans with diabetes. For a start, it uses human genetic material.
Secondly, Dr. Yoon's study shows that hormones controlling blood sugar
needn't be produced in the pancreas. This is important because, in human
insulin-dependent diabetes, also known as Type 1 or juvenile diabetes,
the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the specific pancreas cells
that produce insulin. Another promising approach to treating diabetes,
involving transplants of insulin-produing cells from healthy pancreases,
leaves patients dependent on immunosuppressive drugs to prevent
destruction of the transplanted tissue.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Canadian part of the study was funded by several government and
charitable foundations. Brain Korea 21 Project, an initiative of the
South Korean government, supports the work of Dr. Hyun Chul Lee, one of
Dr. Yoon's South Korean collaborators.

Bayer and Avigen Collaborate on Gene Therapy
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Stephen D. Moore
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>822 words</div><div>17 November 2000</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
German pharmaceutical giant Bayer AG will announce today a $60 million
collaboration with U.S. biotech firm Avigen Inc. on a gene-therapy
treatment for hemophilia B, a rare inherited blood-clotting disorder.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The transaction, which includes the purchase by Bayer of a 2.5% stake
in Avigen, is the latest step in an expensive research revival at the
German company. But it is a risky gamble. Despite enormous scientific
potential, gene therapy has fallen from favor as ballyhooed research
projects have flopped. And the first death apparently linked to gene
therapy last year has spurred a crackdown by regulatory agencies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Gene therapy is the ultimate biotechnology," said Tim Wilson, a
London-based drug analyst with Bear Stearns Cos. "But we've learned that
there isn't a single magic breakthrough that's going to make it happen.
It will be a trial-and-error process, and it doesn't look pretty right
now."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hemophilia B is a genetic disorder caused by the absence or
deficiency of a blood-clotting protein called Factor IX. Bayer officials
estimate that only 8,000 patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan might be
candidates for treatment with Avigen's gene therapy, called Coagulin-B.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But lab tests of Coagulin-B in mice and dogs suggest that a single
round of injections might restore lifelong production of Factor IX at
levels sufficient to transform severe cases of hemophilia B to moderate
ones. Currently, genetically engineered or plasma-derived versions of
Factor IX generate annual global sales of roughly $350 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hemophilia is an obvious gateway into gene therapy for Bayer. The
German giant is one of the world's dominant producers of Factor VIII,
the clotting protein used to treat Hemophilia A, the most common form of
the bleeding disorder. A handful of U.S. biotech companies -- from
Chiron Corp. and Targeted Genetics to Cell Genesys Inc. -- are racing to
develop Factor VIII gene therapies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bayer made a big push in the Factor VIII gene-therapy race in the
mid-1990s with a different U.S. biotech ally, "but the results were
really disappointing," admitted Anthony Nagle, a vice president
responsible for global clinical development of Bayer's hemophilia
products.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although a Factor IX gene therapy represents a far smaller market, it
also is less competitive, at least for now. "And we think the first
company to market will claim the Factor IX gene-therapy market," Mr.
Nagle added.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bayer officials believe Avigen has a lead of at least two years over
potential rivals. The Alameda, Calif., firm already has treated seven
patients with Coagulin-B in early clinical tests to demonstrate safety
and determine a dose that would assure sustained function of the
replacement Factor IX gene. If the current round of testing is
successful, Bayer would take over world-wide development.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Offering a likely development timetable, Mr. Nagle said the pivotal
phase of clinical testing could begin by 2002, followed by applications
for regulatory approval in late 2005 and a market debut the following
year. Bayer officials assume that regulators would require an unusually
long follow-up period to assess the efficacy and safety of early gene
therapies seeking clearance. Mr. Nagle also cautioned that recruitment
of patients also will be slow for such a rare disease. But if all goes
according to plan, Coagulin-B still might be one of the first gene
therapies on the market, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, Bayer reported a 24% rise in third-quarter net income to
534 million euros ($457.9 million) from 431 million euros a year
earlier, as sales climbed 22% to 7.68 billion euros from 6.28 billion
euros. The company's agriculture and health-care divisions were the key
drivers of profit growth; the revenue rise was swelled by favorable
exchange-rate fluctuations. Bayer reaffirmed forecasts calling for
double-digit percentage growth in full-year sales and operating profit,
excluding effects of acquisitions and divestitures.

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The family of a teenager who died during a
gene-therapy experiment last year has settled a wrongful-death lawsuit
against his doctors and the University of Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jesse Gelsinger, 18 years old, of Tucson, Ariz., died Sept. 17, 1999,
four days after starting the experiment. Mr. Gelsinger's death is the
first known to have been caused by gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Terms of the settlement weren't released. Penn released a statement
saying that it hopes the deal "will enable the Gelsingers to bring a
small measure of closure to their loss."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A call placed to the the Gelsingers' home in Arizona wasn't returned.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger suffered from an inherited disorder that inhibits
nitrogen processing in the body. The disorder usually kills boys at a
young age, but Mr. Gelsinger controlled his condition with drugs and a
low-protein diet.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers hoped to correct the problem by injecting into his liver
a cold virus that had been modified to carry a gene that would control
the condition.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But 24 hours after the therapy began, his condition deteriorated.
After two days, he slipped into a coma. He eventually was taken off life
support.

Gene Therapy
Gets a Boost
From New Study
</b>
</div><div class="author">

</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>1278 words</div><div>29 August 2000</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B1</div><div>English</div><div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists reported what they described as the first objective
evidence that gene therapy successfully helped patients grow new blood
vessels and significantly increased blood flow to heart muscle.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In fact, the study found that the treatment not only improved tissue
that had suffered from a restricted blood supply, as demonstrated while
the patient exercised, but it also appeared to rescue areas of the heart
that caused pain even when a patient was at rest -- a result that
surprised and delighted the researchers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report, being published today in the journal Circulation, is a
boost for proponents of gene therapy, a fledgling field that has been
mired in controversy for the past year after a young patient's death
raised regulatory concerns over human trials. It also follows recent
disappointing studies of gene-based therapy in heart patients that have
fueled skepticism over the technique.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This is a vote of confidence for gene therapy in cardiovascular
disease," said Jonathan L. Halperin, director of clinical cardiology at
Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. "They have demonstrated pretty
convincingly that they have improved the blood supply to suffering heart
muscle."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But Dr. Halperin, who wasn't involved in the research, cautioned that
it is too early to know whether such a treatment will ultimately help
large numbers of patients, or whether the initial benefits will
translate into sustained improvement.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report is based on the experience of just 13 patients. Even if
the results are borne out in subsequent larger studies, it is likely to
be several years before researchers know whether gene therapy can
predictably promote blood-vessel growth -- a process called angiogenesis
-- and thus play an important role in treating heart disease. Up to now,
favorable evidence has been based largely on such measures as how long
patients can walk on an exercise treadmill or reports of improvement in
chest pain, subjective criteria that can easily be influenced by factors
other than treatment. Randomized studies comparing the therapy to a
placebo, or dummy treatment, are needed to provide more objective
results.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new study, conducted by a group of researchers at Tufts
University School of Medicine and St. Elizabeth's Medical Center, both
in Boston, isn't randomized. But Jeffrey Isner, a Tufts researcher and
the study's principal investigator, said what makes it different is how
the effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated. The 13 patients -- all
of whom had chronic chest pain and had failed either balloon
angioplasty, coronary bypass surgery or both -- underwent an imaging
exam to determine which areas of the heart were deficient in blood
supply and a new cardiac mapping test that can distinguish between
normal and blood-starved heart tissue. Then they were given injections
of DNA for a substance called vascular endothelial growth factor, or
VEGF, directly into four sites in the heart muscle where blood supply
was blocked or compromised.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sixty days later, the imaging and mapping studies were repeated. Each
test showed that, on average, the amount of compromised heart tissue was
substantially reduced. In addition, while the tests were conducted
separately, the tissue identified as improved was essentially the same
in both. Dr. Isner said the consistency of the two tests amounted to
credible objective evidence of the effectiveness of the treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, the post-treatment tests showed that in five patients,
an area of heart muscle the researchers figured was particularly damaged
from lack of blood -- probably as a result of a major heart attack --
was completely revived. In four other patients, such a damaged area was
partially restored.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cardiologists refer to such damaged tissue as "hibernating" heart
muscle and it is especially difficult to rescue. Untreated, it
undermines the heart's ability to pump blood effectively to the rest of
the body and leaves patients vulnerable to congestive heart failure. "It
looked like an infarct [tissue damaged by a heart attack] just went
away," Dr. Isner said of the mapping results. "There must have been
something biologically meaningful happening here."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mt. Sinai's Dr. Halperin agreed that with the imaging and mapping
studies, "it looked as though areas of heart muscle that weren't dead,
but weren't functioning, seemed to be able to function again after the
angiogenic factor was given."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patients also reported improvement in symptoms and were able to
perform on an exercise treadmill for much longer periods than they were
before treatment, the study found. Dr. Isner said hardly any patients
reported any symptom improvement until at least six weeks after the
treatment, a delay he considers consistent with a plausible length of
time for new blood vessels to sprout and begin restoring blood flow to
heart tissue.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In an editorial accompanying the report, Cam Patterson and Marschall
S. Runge, cardiologists at the University of Texas Medical Branch,
Galveston, who weren't involved in the study, called it "a breath of
fresh air" given current criticism of gene therapy. But they stressed
that many hurdles must be cleared before any gene-therapy strategies
become available to patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, while Dr. Isner maintains that combining the imaging and
mapping tests amounts to a new way to objectively evaluate the effects
of angiogenesis therapy, the editorialists questioned whether the
mapping technique actually offers important "additional evidence" beyond
that obtained by imaging.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Isner and his colleagues face other skeptics. His technique
involves injecting "naked DNA" directly into tissue. That is considered
an inefficient, hit-or-miss tactic for repairing or enhancing the body's
genetic machinery because there is little certainty that the DNA will
find its way into the appropriate cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Several other researchers are using a deactivated virus, such as an
adenovirus (a cause of the common cold) as so-called vectors to carry
genetic material into cells, transferring new genetic instructions in
the process. The idea is that such a strategy will marshall a lot more
cells into action than the naked-DNA approach.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But use of viral vectors has raised safety concerns. Jesse Gelsinger,
an Arizona teenager whose death a year ago in a gene-therapy experiment
prompted intense regulatory scrutiny of the field, is believed to have
died from an immune-system reaction to the adenovirus used to transport
new genetic material into cells in his body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Isner maintains that the use of naked DNA avoids such concerns,
but he acknowledges that his technique might result in just one cell in
a hundred getting instructions to produce and secrete VEGF proteins
needed to spur blood-vessel growth. "But if that one cell were the
Arnold Schwarzenegger of cells and produced gangbuster amounts of the
protein," he said, it could be sufficient to do the job.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the study, Dr. Isner used a version of VEGF discovered by a
researcher at Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif. But
Genentech, which has tried without success so far to develop a protein
made by a different form of VEGF for angiogenesis, didn't sponsor the
study, which was funded by the National Institutes of Health and two
foundation grants.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Isner has led other trials using DNA for yet a third growth
factor licensed from Human Genome Sciences Inc. of Rockville, Md. Those
trials, sponsored by Vascular Genetics Inc. of Research Triangle Park,
N.C., were suspended by the Food and Drug Administration earlier this
year for what it termed violations in the handling of the experimental
studies. Dr. Isner said he has had a series of favorable discussions
with the FDA and is confident that the regulatory issues will be
satisfactorily resolved, enabling the trials to resume.

Health & Technology:
NIH Advisory Group May Recommend
Restoring Power to Gene-Therapy Panel
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Chris Adams

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- An advisory group at the National Institutes of Health
may recommend that a special gene-therapy panel be given greater
authority, restoring some of the power it had lost in previous years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, as of now, the group won't recommend that the NIH panel
return to its previous role of essentially approving all new
gene-therapy experiments, according to a draft report. That authority
was withdrawn in the mid-1990s, but recent controversies surrounding the
field have led to calls for its restoration. The Food and Drug
Administration has primary oversight over gene therapy and must approve
all new experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The advisory group will suggest that the NIH increase the size of the
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, that advises the NIH
director about gene-therapy matters, according to the draft. The group
also will recommend a change in the timing of approval for gene-therapy
experiments to give the agency greater say over the design of
experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The draft report, dated last week, eventually will be presented to
the NIH director; the issue will come up for discussion at a special NIH
meeting this week. The NIH director can ignore the recommendations or
implement them by changing NIH rules and guidelines.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The issue of the RAC's role is of vital importance to biotechnology
companies, which sponsor much of the nation's gene-therapy research. The
field has been under a spotlight since an 18-year-old Arizona man died
while participating in an experiment. Researchers were scolded for
failing to properly report safety data to the NIH, and the NIH was
criticized for failing to keep better watch over the field. That
prompted then-NIH Director Harold Varmus to convene a group to decide if
the RAC needed more power.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the report is still a draft and could change before acting NIH
director Ruth Kirschstein gets it, it has circulated among people in the
gene-therapy field. Industry representatives who have seen it said they
were pleased with some aspects, such as the recommendation not to fully
restore the RAC's approval authority. They were upset about other
proposals, such as recommendations to expand the RAC and devote more
resources to reviewing experiment-by-experiment safety data.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy - tinkering with disease where it first goes wrong, in the molecules and proteins on millions of gene strands - sounds like a medical dream come true, the ultimate high-tech cure for any and all deadly diseases. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the experimental tests required in gene therapy are an ethical and medical minefield fraught with the potential abuse of vulnerable, frightened human subjects, a disturbing intersection of medicine and multibillion-dollar drug companies and the too-real risk - sometimes - of death. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using the 100,000 genes in the human genome to cure disease is "intellectually appealing," said Dr. Ronald Crystal, a gene therapy scientist at Weill Cornell Medical Center. "People are worried, but they see the possible wonder of it in terms of treating human disease." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the past year, three experimental gene therapy tests - in Boston, Pennsylvania and Memphis - have been shut down by the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees all drug testing, following allegations that participants had not been fully informed of risks or properly screened. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients and their families are questioning the means, if not the results, of the trials. "The way it was presented to us, it was safe," said Paul Gelsinger, father of Jesse Gelsinger, who died in the Pennsylvania gene therapy trial. "The oversight in this was totally inadequate." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Allegations of improper conduct in testing are "certainly not helpful to this new class of medicines," said Dr. Savio Woo, a gene therapy scientist at Mount Sinai Medical Center and president of the American Society for Gene Therapy. "It damages the reputation of gene therapy in the minds of the public." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we don't know is, if obvious wrongdoings are the tip of the iceberg, or whether they are isolated and rare incidents," said Dr. Ruth Macklin, a bioethicist at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experimental drug study participants are very ill and turn to gene therapy as a last resort. Many die, usually from underlying disease. It can be difficult to separate the consequences of the treatment from the disease itself. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Treating patients in ways that may only help scientists and the drug companies that often bankroll their experiments raises anew ethical questions about what - and when - patients and the public should be told about experimental test results. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the center of the growing furor over human gene therapy is Boston researcher Dr. Jeffrey Isner. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this year, the FDA shut down Isner's experiments at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston with a growth gene called VEGF that, injected into the hearts of patients with inadequate arteries, is supposed to grow new blood vessels. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The FDA charged that Isner - who owns 5% of Vascular Genetics Inc., which funds his research - wrongly allowed a patient into the study who had cancer that may have been worsened by the experimental therapy, and improperly autopsied another's participant's heart after she died. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The benefits, if Isner's approach proved viable, would be sweeping and clear: Heart disease, much of which includes blocked arteries, is the No. 1 killer of men and women in the United States. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Said Sonya Hagopian, spokeswoman for St. Elizabeth's, "I have met a ton of patients who absolutely swear they are alive today because they were participants in the studies."  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IT WAS A YEAR ago that Dr. Eugene Albu offered himself up as a medical experiment - and, he felt, with good reason. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A surgeon at Bronx-Lebanon Hospital, Albu had prostate cancer, newly diagnosed and extremely aggressive. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His urologist gave him the standard options - radiation, surgery, radioactive seed implantation. And then he added one more. Mount Sinai Medical Center had a presurgery gene therapy clinical trial underway, and Albu fit the profile: men with advanced prostate cancer that had not yet spread. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Did Albu want to consider that? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the procedure - like gene therapy itself, so far - carries some risk and no certain benefits? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yes, even so. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After the therapy, Albu sat outside a Bronx-Lebanon operating room where he had just removed a patient's inflamed gallbladder and recalled his own experience as a patient and his reasons for choosing the less-traveled road. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I believed in the treatment," said Albu, a soft-spoken man of 74 whose gentle, unhurried manner belies the assurance associated with surgeons. "So I had, maybe, something to gain and nothing to lose." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As Albu well knew, human gene therapy was the brave new world of medicine. Ever since the first gene therapy experiment was performed on humans in 1990, the field has generated considerable hope, hype and, of late, criticism. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN SEPTEMBER, only four months after Albu received his treatment, the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger at the University of Pennsylvania put the experimental trials under the microscope. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea, and the hope, behind gene therapy involves treating, and some day curing, diseases by infusing patients with healthy DNA or by removing disease-causing genes and replacing them with healthy ones. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cancer patients, for example, genetic therapies are being developed to directly kill cancer cells or stimulate the body's immune system. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clinical trials performed on human patients are monitored by both the National Institutes of Health and the Federal Drug Administration, as well as by individual hospitals that are active in gene therapy research. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To date, no cures have been attributed to gene therapy, although anecdotal success stories continue to offer encouragement to patients who, too often, are running out of options. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When researcher-physician Dr. Simon Hall first met patient-to-be Albu, he was struck by the elderly surgeon's fierce determination. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Most of the patients I speak to take quite a bit of time making up their minds [whether to undergo experimental treatment]," Hall said. "But he had already made up his mind. He's a surgeon, and surgeons are trained to make quick decisions." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most patients bombard Hall with questions. Is the procedure dangerous? Will it delay my surgery? What side effects are likely? </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Albu asked very little. He had read the medical literature on the subject and, coincidentally, had attended a seminar on gene therapy six months earlier, little knowing the subject would soon turn personal. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But he listened carefully as Hall described the procedure: It would be a Phase I clinical trial, intended only to determine how large a dose can be safely given. There was no guarantee it would be effective, no promise of cure. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An adenovirus, which causes the common cold, would be injected directly into the prostate. The thymidine kinase - or tk - gene rides on the adenovirus, a microscopic hitchhiker with a mission. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A day later, he would receive the anti-viral drug ganciclovir intravenously for a week. By itself, ganciclovir is used to treat viral infections in AIDS or organ-transplant patients. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In combination, the theory goes, the tk cells and the ganciclovir will kill tumor cells and boost the immune system to destroy any stray cancer cells outside the prostate - a presurgery cleanup, in effect. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Flu-like symptoms are to be expected. Less common, but possible, are skin rashes or a bout of hepatitis. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And one more thing, Hall told Albu: "You could have a significant reaction and die." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the risk of death is minuscule, medical ethics dictate that patients must be told. Jesse Gelsinger had known the risks when he volunteered for a gene trial to cure his rare, often-fatal liver ailment. But after his death, Gelsinger's father questioned whether the then-healthy young man should have been included in the study. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Informed consent and the reporting of adverse reactions during clinical trials are major concerns to federal officials at the NIH and FDA charged with keeping patients safe. Since Gelsinger's death, the University of Pennsylvania has ceased all clinical trials on human subjects. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Albu's case, even surgery alone was a matter for debate. Prostate cancer progresses slowly, and surgery usually is not recommended in patients his age, when complications - incontinence and impotence - tend to be worse. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But nothing dissuaded Albu. He wanted to undergo the procedure. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I tried to emphasize that the potential benefit is really unknown," said Hall, who was surprised by Albu's determination. "He pretty much decided it was worth the gamble." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked about his reasons, Albu smiled and ran a hand through his hair. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If I know the prostate is in the laboratory and not in me, it is better," he joked, the accent of his native Romania inflecting his words. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AND ALBU felt he had much to live for. His wife of 52 years, "an old-fashioned marriage." His son and daughter-in-law and his adored granddaughters, ages 17 and 12. His work, as a surgeon and a teacher. His love of reading and watching TV and traveling, "everywhere - to New Zealand, Tasmania, Antarctica." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On June 1, 1999, Albu entered the hospital for the gene- adenovirus injection. As expected, he suffered flu-like fever and chills. Also as expected, a blood test showed his PSA - prostate specific antigen - shot up from an already-elevated 14.9 to 26.9. Hall attributed it to an inflammation from the injected virus. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The intravenous ganciclovir infusion caused no reaction, and he went home after a week to await his prostate removal surgery. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had been the fifth of six patients to receive the experimental treatment, and the oldest. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late June, Albu's prostate was removed. By July 21, his PSA level had fallen to .1, as expected after surgery. On Aug. 4, the reading dropped even further, to 0.07. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't make anything of it," Hall said of the lower reading, "but [Albu] thought it was because of the gene therapy." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The apparent good news was short-lived. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By December, Albu's PSA level had begun climbing again. It was only .13, but even that indicated the presence of malignant cells. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">HIS UROLOGIST put him on hormone therapy, a maintenance treatment that causes uncomfortable hot flashes. He complains about them, then shrugs. He still works a full hospital schedule, from 7:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's 74; he could easily retire," Hall said admiringly. "But he's up there operating, teaching." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the fall, after Gelsinger's death in Philadelphia, Mount Sinai voluntarily suspended clinical trials to allow for an internal review of all procedures, even though no known problems existed. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Albu, the trial was already over, and with no provable advantage. But because prostate cancer is a slowly progressing disease, Hall expects his former patient may live for another 10 or 15 years. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Outside Bronx-Lebanon's operating room, dressed in his blue surgical scrubs, Albu called himself "stubborn" and said that, except for moderate incontinence, he was feeling okay. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am alive," he said, his voice strong and determined. "I am operating. It's not easy, but I'm a tough old guy."Graphic: AN EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT FOR PROSTATE CANCERHOW IT WORKS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy is still in its early stages, but researchers believe it has tremendous potential to treat deadly and disabling illness such as cancer, cystic fibrosis and the overproduction of cholesterol and even to prevent disease. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Viruses, which target human cells, are a promising delivery system for therapeutic genes. They carry the genes to targeted cells. The combination of new genes and other drug treatments can kill off malignant cells without damaging healthy cells. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Basically, there are two types of gene therapy: somatic (body) gene therapy and germline (egg and sperm) gene therapy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In somatic gene therapy, the patients genome is altered in a corrective way, but the change isnt passed on to the next generation. This is the type of therapy being tested at laboratories around the world. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Germline gene therapy, not currently being pursued, would modify genes to pass changes along to ones offspring.DR. ALBU'S PROCEDURE1. The adenovirus, carrying the thymidine kinase (tk) gene taken from the herpes simplex virus, which does not occur naturally in humans, but is a cancer-cell killer is injected directly into the patients prostate. This, essentially, is a delivery system, placing the genes in position within the prostate to await the next step. 2. The next day, the patient begins a one-week intravenous course of the anti- viral drug ganciclovir. Ganciclovir is most commonly used to treat viral infections in organ-transplant recipients or patients with AIDS. In combination with the tk genes, it is supposed to kill tumor cells and boost the bodys immune system to destroy any stray cancer cells outside the prostate.3. The patient goes home for two to three weeks. During this period, researchers believe, cancer cells are dying, thus shrinking the tumor. Unlike chemotherapy, the treatment targets cancer cells without killing healthy cells. 4. The patient returns to the hospital for surgical removal of the prostate.5. Routine followup treatment, including PSA (prostate specific antigen) blood tests, which can indicate the presence of cancer cells.  </p>

University of Pennsylvania Will End
Gene-Therapy Research on Humans

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The University of Pennsylvania said its gene-therapy research
institute will no longer conduct studies involving humans, in its latest
response to the death of a teenager during an experiment there.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The institute will instead limit its research to animal experiments
and preclinical work, while other Penn departments take up gene-therapy
studies involving human subjects. University officials also said Penn
will strengthen oversight and monitoring of all clinical trials, among
other changes to its research policies, after criticism from the
government and an outside-panel report released yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The university-appointed panel, suggested Penn carefully review the
way it handles human subjects and ensure informed consent is properly
obtained from research participants. It said financial relationships
between researchers and private companies "may be ill advised."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The panel didn't make a judgment about the September death of
18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, who received treatment with experimental
gene-therapy for a rare liver disorder. Following the death, the FDA
halted six gene-therapy trials at the institute, citing violations of
federal rules.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
William Danforth, the panel's chairman, said the agency's criticisms
dealt mainly with "technical" errors, such as delays in the reporting of
adverse events. "The question is, did those things cause the death of
Jesse Gelsinger," said Dr. Danforth, a physician who sits on the board
of trustees at Washington University in St. Louis. "I think there is not
evidence for that."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
James Wilson, director of the institute, will remain in that
position. But changes in the institute's function will limit his role to
designing studies, not conducting them, said university President Judith
Rodin. The institute's staff and budget will be reduced and many of its
researchers will move to other departments, she said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The panel's report recommended the university review
conflict-of-interest issues between researchers and private companies
that fund gene-therapy trials. Dr. Wilson is the founder of Genovo Inc.,
a Sharon Hill, Pa., biotechnology company in which he holds an equity
stake. Genovo funds nearly one fourth of the institute's budget and has
rights to certain technologies that may be discovered there, a company
spokesman said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Wilson couldn't be reached for comment. In a prepared statement
released by the university, he said: "I am confident that the steps
outlined today will help position Penn in the future as a model
environment for the conduct and oversight of all types of clinical
research, especially gene therapy."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The government will turn its attention to the issue of gene-therapy
trials today at a Senate health-subcommittee hearing.

IRVINE, Calif. -- Shares of Nexell Therapeutics Inc. rallied in heavy
trading Friday, a day after the biotechnology company announced French
researchers had used its cell-culture containers in what Nexell said is
being hailed as one of the first successes in gene therapy.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nexell said that the French researchers had used its cell-culture
containers with stem cells containing a key missing gene to create a
treatment for X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency. At 4 p.m.
Friday in Nasdaq Stock Market trading, Nexell was up 55%, or $1.6563, at
$4.6875.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The disorder is rare, inherited and popularly called the "boy in a
bubble" disease because some patients must be completely isolated to
prevent infections. The disorder leaves victims unable to fight off
infection.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The French researchers reported their findings in the April 28 issue
of Science Magazine. The researchers reported results from two children
born with the disorder, in whom "sustained clinical benefit" was
observed 10 months after the treatment. Unlike other gene-therapy
experiments, the French team inserted the missing gene into the
patients' stem cells outside the body, and then transplanted the
corrected stem cells back into the patients.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This process was conducted in Nexell's Lifecell X-Fold containers
coated with RetroNectin, recombinant human fibronectin fragment,
supplied by Japan's Takara Shuzo Co., Biomedical Group1.

In the summer of 1997, Patricia Aneff's lung tumor seemed invincible.
It had nasty tentacles that made surgery out of the question. Three
rounds of chemotherapy "made me look like E.T. but didn't do zippo to
the tumor," says the Abilene, Texas, woman. "I didn't think I would live
to see the millennium."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Then Ms. Aneff became a test subject in an entirely new way to attack
cancer: gene therapy. A lab test found her tumor cells had defective
genes known as p53, whose function is to brake runaway cell growth. When
doctors injected her tumor with sound copies of p53, it shrank into a
little ball, and surgeons handily removed it. Mrs. Aneff celebrated New
Year's Eve with friends and then headed to a midnight church service.
She now appears to be cancer-free.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy seeks to treat diseases by using biological
sleight-of-hand to insert replacement genes into cells that have missing
or defective copies of those genes. It has come under heavy scrutiny
since the November death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, who had a
genetic liver disease, in a trial at the University of Pennsylvania.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Critics note that gene therapy has now been tried for a decade with
few positive results. In trial after trial, scientists have injected
genes to treat diseases such as cystic fibrosis, only to find nothing
happened, probably because the genes never got into cells where they
were needed.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But just as public opinion on gene therapy has soured, several
significant successes have been achieved. In preliminary trials at
Children's Hospital in Philadelphia, children with hemophilia were
treated with genes that helped their bodies make a blood-clotting
protein they lacked. Boston researchers have relieved chest pain caused
by clogged arteries by injecting hearts with genes that caused new blood
vessels to grow. And French doctors recently reported initial successes
in treating children with a rare genetic defect that destroys their
immune systems and forces them to live in isolation.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Only in cancer, however, has gene-replacement therapy progressed into
Phase III trials, the final-stage research aimed at getting Food and
Drug Administration approval. Pharmaceutical companies Schering-Plough
Corp. and Aventis SA, which is working with closely held Introgen
Therapeutics Inc., were so impressed with early results that they
recently launched large studies in ovarian and head-and-neck cancers.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is by no means certain the trials will succeed. Scientists fear
that gene therapy may kill only those cancer cells in the small area
around the injection, not the entire tumor. And even if it annihilates
the entire tumor, the therapy is powerless against any malignant cells
that may have migrated elsewhere in the body. Even with the best results
from these two tests, it will be at least three years before the FDA
approves gene therapy for cancer outside of clinical trials.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But these two final-stage trials represent a ray of hope. And
Introgen has also seen initial promising results in a Phase II, or
midstage, lung-cancer trial that is a follow-on to earlier trials
involving Ms. Aneff and others. In addition, doctors are testing p53
gene therapy for possible effect against prostate, breast and brain
cancers.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I don't think anybody harbors the illusion that you can take one
gene off the shelf, inject it, and bingo, all tumors disappear," says
James Zwiebel, an oncologist at the National Cancer Institute, which
finances several gene-therapy trials. Still, he says that eventually,
"it is very likely that p53 replacement therapy will become part of our
standard treatment for some cancers."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Over the past several years, about 600 people have been infused with
the p53 gene. The gene is known broadly as a "tumor suppressor," one of
whose jobs is to sense when there is a problem with a cell and direct it
to commit suicide. So it's a problem if the gene isn't doing its job.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The powerful role of p53 in human cancers was demonstrated by
researchers at Johns Hopkins University 11 years ago. The gene -- which
can be damaged by excessive sunlight, carcinogens such as cigarette
smoke, or random duplicating errors during cell division -- is believed
to be defective in 50% to 75% of human cancers, says Johns Hopkins
professor Bert Vogelstein, whose lab did the pioneering work.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To insert an intact copy of the gene into cells that lack one,
scientists use a virus. Its harmful core is removed, and the p53 gene is
inserted into the virus. The theory: The virus will do what viruses
normally do -- infect cells. But instead of bearing a pathogen, they
will carry in a beneficial gene.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In cancer, experimental gene therapy has caused some severe side
effects such as high fevers, but it has proved less toxic than
chemotherapy.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To date, 230 patients with head-and-neck cancer have been treated in
three Phase II trials, says Antoine Yver, senior director of oncology
gene research at Aventis, a drug company formed last year by the merger
of Hoechst and Rhone Poulenc. Some tumors shrank dramatically. Others
stopped growing -- not forever, perhaps, but long enough to buy the
patient a few more months.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Of the patients, 6% saw their head or neck tumors shrink by half or
more. While that was less than Aventis had hoped, by another measure the
therapy was working better than expected: Overall, 26% of patients found
their tumors either shrank or stopped growing. Looked at another way,
given that some patients had more than one cancerous growth, 60% of the
tumors injected either shrank or stopped growing for between two and 18
months.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This may not sound like much. But in the test group -- patients
expected to live only about four months -- even a few extra months of
life could be enough to win FDA approval, and possibly make this the
first gene therapy on the market.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One doctor who took an early interest in the gene was Jack Roth, a
lung-cancer surgeon who was frustrated by his enemy's power. "I was
operating on a lot of patients, but it was clear it wasn't working," Dr.
Roth says. "We needed to do something else."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Intrigued by the Johns Hopkins reports on p53, Dr. Roth began
experiments in which the gene was shot into lung cells of special mice
with human tumors. "The tumors didn't grow at all, or regressed," Dr.
Roth says. After dozens of animal studies, he founded Introgen in 1992
to raise money for human trials. The Austin, Texas, company has filed to
make an initial public offering; Dr. Roth owns 7% of it and stands to
benefit if its IPO is a success.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the first patient, a 60-year-old man with a lung tumor
unresponsive to radiation, the cancer disappeared. "It was very
exciting. It was the first clue something was going on," Dr. Roth says.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Then, in a reminder of the limitations of the therapy, the patient
died four months later from another tumor, in his kidney.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the patient's extra months represented an advance, the kind
of virus used was difficult and costly to manufacture. Seeking another
way to deliver the gene to cancer cells, Introgen turned to an
adenovirus, a virus of the sort that causes colds. It was emptied of its
normal contents, and p53 was inserted.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In association with Dr. Roth, Gary L. Clayman, a surgeon at M.D.
Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, began using the adenovirus for
experimental gene therapy on 33 people with head-and-neck cancer in
1995. Although steps had been taken to render the virus harmless, "we
didn't really know" whether it could still cause harm, Dr. Clayman says.
He wore a double set of gloves, washed carefully -- and worried about
bringing home a virus to his newborn son.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first few doses caused no ills, but no tumors shrank, either.
Then researchers increased the dose a hundredfold, and began to see
shrinkage. Introgen expanded the trials and began working with Aventis,
which is financing the work in exchange for possible future marketing
rights.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patients in the expanded trials, all with advanced cancer
unresponsive to other therapies, were expected to live only a few
months. Gene therapy clearly had an effect, halting the growth of some
tumors and shrinking some others. "The surprising thing for us
investigators was that it worked at all," says John T. Hamm, an
oncologist in Louisville, Ky. "Some people are disappointed that gene
therapy hasn't revolutionized the world yet. It's a question of glass
half empty or half full."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Leonard Taylor, a 50-year-old lawyer, was one of the lucky ones. He
had a golf-ball-size tumor on his neck, which hurt his ability to chew
and caused him to lose 40 pounds. It was too close to an artery for
surgery. Chemotherapy shrank it at first but stopped working after six
months.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Taylor then saw a newspaper ad for gene-therapy trials and signed
up. He got his first shot in June 1998. Within three months, he was
elated to find that the tumor had started to shrink. Now, nearly two
years later, it appears to have disappeared except for a mass of scar
tissue.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Doctors don't know if any live cancer cells are still present, so he
goes back every month for another gene-therapy shot. "We're out there
where no one has gone before," Mr. Taylor says. "We'll just take it one
shot at a time and see how it goes."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Though the Jesse Gelsinger death raised alarms about safety, gene
therapy for cancer is less toxic than chemotherapy. Two patients in
Introgen's initial trial died for unknown reasons, leaving open the
possibility that the therapy was responsible. But in a safety analysis
prepared for federal authorities, Aventis found that, of 307 patients
treated in Phase II trials for all types of cancer, there were no
deaths, and only 3% had serious side effects, the most common being
fever, infection or bleeding in the tumor. With chemotherapy, five times
that many would have had serious side effects, Aventis's Dr. Yver says,
and about 3% would have died. One reason for the relative safety of gene
therapy for cancer may be that genes are injected into the tumor or
right next to it, avoiding other parts of the body.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Shown this data, federal officials have largely let cancer trials
continue, while halting several gene-therapy trials for other
conditions. The government did stop an early-stage cancer trial at
Schering-Plough, involving colorectal and liver tumors, pending a safety
analysis. But Schering's final-stage ovarian-cancer trial will proceed.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now comes the real test: large Phase III trials comparing gene
therapy to standard treatments. In a trial Aventis and Introgen have
just begun, about 240 people with head-and-neck cancer will be randomly
assigned to get either the gene therapy or a mild chemotherapy drug. The
test subjects will have cancer that has recurred, and they will be too
frail for powerful chemotherapy or have cancer that hasn't responded to
it. They'll have a median expected survival of four months; the goal is
to see if the therapy can make them live about seven months.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It works. Tumors shrink," Dr. Roth says. "The question is, does it
work as well or better than existing treatments?"
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There is ample reason for concern. In 1996, Novartis AG began the
first Phase III trial of any kind of gene therapy, seeking to treat a
deadly brain tumor called glioblastoma. The idea was to insert a gene
that made the tumor vulnerable to a drug. Early trials had shown
dramatic tumor shrinkage. But the big, final-stage one found that it
didn't extend survival.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Aventis, hedging its bets, is also planning a separate trial to see
whether gene therapy can make cancer cells more vulnerable to
chemotherapy. A second 300-patient study will test p53 gene therapy in
combination with a strong chemotherapy drug in head-and-neck cancers,
compared with chemotherapy alone.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In lung cancer -- the most common cause of cancer-related death in
the U.S. -- Introgen is just beginning a midstage test of the use of p53
and radiation together. The company says in its IPO filing that the
results are "promising" and will be presented later this month before
the American Society of Clinical Oncology.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In trial subject Charles Rogers, 67, the treatment appears to have
killed a tumor about the size of a large lemon. "I can tell you I
wouldn't be here today without the gene therapy," says Mr. Rogers, a
retired insurance agent in Oklahoma. "It saved my life."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Yver is more cautious. "Normally, radiation alone does do
something in these patients, so it's hard to tell which therapy is doing
what," he says.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, Schering-Plough has licensed Johns Hopkins's initial
patents on p53 therapy from Genzyme Corp., a Cambridge, Mass., company
that owns the rights, and has tested p53 treatment in 200 patients in
various cancers, with mixed results. In ovarian cancer, it was pleased
with the outcome and has launched a final-stage study with patients who
have already had surgery.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There is no such thing as a magic bullet to cause all cancers to go
away," says M.D. Anderson's Dr. Clayman. "All cancer treatment is
incremental, and so is gene therapy."

FDA Criticizes
Isner On Studies
Of Gene Therapy
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Chris Adams
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>501 words</div><div>3 May 2000</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration harshly criticized a
prominent gene-therapy researcher for what it termed serious violations
in experimental studies, including the treatment of a cancer patient
investigators said shouldn't have been enrolled.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The studies were led by Dr. Jeffrey Isner, chief of vascular medicine
at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston and a researcher at Tufts
University. In March, the FDA said it was putting on hold a series of
gene-therapy studies led by Dr. Isner and sponsored by Vascular Genetics
Inc. of Research Triangle Park, N.C. At the time, the FDA didn't specify
the reasons for the clinical holds.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But on Friday, the agency sent a "warning letter" to Dr. Isner, which
said that a recent inspection "raised concerns about the quality of your
clinical research" and that the violations it cited "appear to be the
result of a serious lack of knowledge of your responsibilities as
principal investigator."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The warning followed a similar warning to the gene-therapy program at
the University of Pennsylvania. Last fall, an 18-year-old patient in a
gene-therapy experiment there died. His death, the first linked directly
to gene therapy, triggered a wide-ranging examination of the science and
regulation of the relatively young field.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Isner couldn't be reached for comment. A Vascular Genetics
official said the company had been working with the hospital and Dr.
Isner to correct problems even before receiving the FDA's letter and is
hopeful the research will be allowed to resume. A spokeswoman for St.
Elizabeth's said the hospital is still developing its response to the
FDA's warning letter. The FDA had no further comment about the letter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA said the Isner studies, which aim to develop gene-therapy
products for the treatment of vascular disease, enrolled a patient for a
study designed to exclude patients with evidence of cancer, though the
patient had a "prominent lung mass" later diagnosed as cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patient's enrollment "indicates a serious lack of study oversight
and supervision," the FDA wrote. "Treatment of subjects outside the
approved protocol may have exposed them to an unreasonable and
significant risk of illness or injury."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The letter goes on to note that "exclusion criteria" apparently
weren't assessed for two patients; that many subjects didn't have
complete physical exams during or after treatment; that informed-consent
forms were handled improperly; that a subject's death wasn't properly
reported to the institutional review board monitoring the experiment;
and that the examination of the heart of a patient who died was
improperly handled by Dr. Isner himself.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA is requiring Dr. Isner to respond within 15 business days
laying out a plan to correct and prevent future violations. Failure to
correct problems could result in enforcement actions, such as
disqualification from participating in future FDA-sanctioned research.

Gene Therapy: Expect Progress, Not Miracles
</b>
</div><div class="author">

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Twenty years ago Martin Cline, a specialist in blood diseases at the
University of California, Los Angeles, performed what was probably the
first attempt at human gene therapy. His ambition was to cure
thalassemia, an inherited and ultimately fatal anemia caused by genetic
defects in the production of hemoglobin. The plan was to extract the
bone marrow cells of patients, mix in copies of the normal human gene,
and return the altered cells with the expectation that healthy
hemoglobin would be produced. There was scant knowledge from experiments
in mice about how to introduce genes into cells effectively or the
long-term consequences of such manipulation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
UCLA refused permission for the gene-therapy attempt, so Dr. Cline
collaborated with clinics in Italy and Israel. He was severely censured
for this allegedly reckless foray into the uncharted territory of
inserting recombinant genes into human beings. As far as is known, the
attempt failed; while the therapy did not harm the patients, there was
no evidence of benefit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The field of gene therapy has continued to be a roller coaster ride
for virtually all those involved: suffering patients and their desperate
families, laboratory scientists and clinical researchers, university
hospitals and their ethical oversight committees, biotechnology
companies and their investors, the Food and Drug Administration, the
National Institutes of Health and Congress.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It seemed that the roller coaster had reached a nadir last year with
the toxic death of a young man at the University of Pennsylvania in a
gene-therapy protocol. The backlash around his death called into
question not only the scientific soundness of gene therapy, but also the
probity of scientists and clinical researchers, the stock prices of
biotechnology companies and the efficacy of governmental oversight.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now, less than eight months since the tragedy in Pennsylvania,
scientists in Paris have published the first convincing evidence of the
reversal of a human disease using gene therapy. How are we to greet this
news in light of earlier summits of hope and hype and the recent depths
of disappointment and despair?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The concept of gene therapy has had deep and widespread appeal, in
large part because of the simplicity of its logic. Inherited diseases
that are due to an absent or aberrant gene would seem to be to best
remedied by supplying the healthy, functioning gene. Cancer, which
occurs because of acquired mutations in genes that control cell growth,
would be most rationally addressed by providing normal genes that
restore restraint on the wild and aggressive cells. And for AIDS, a
disease that results from the destructive genes of HIV, treatment could
use artificial genes to neutralize those of the virus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Such treatment scenarios grip the imagination of biologist and
businessman alike, and gene therapy was marketed to the public as a near
panacea just around the corner. Further boosting its appeal were
expansive promises made in the race to decode the human genome. We were
told that we will soon hold in our hands the genetic keys to all our
biology and our pathology; gene therapy will use these keys to open up a
future free from disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Such overblown expectations gradually deflated as researchers
repeatedly failed to deliver significant clinical benefits. Genes
inserted into cells did not usually persist, but seemed to be "spit out"
by the cells. Those healthy genes that survived did not function at high
enough levels to substitute for the defective genes. Yet the French
researchers, led by Alain Fischer, were able to restore to health two
"bubble babies" with a severe inherited immune deficiency.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Interestingly, the French approach had similarities to the failed and
censured attempt taken by UCLA's Martin Cline. Bone marrow cells were
removed from the infants and, in the laboratory, the missing healthy
gene was introduced. The altered cells were then given back to the
children, and these cells grew so well, they restored the immune system.
This simple idea, once lambasted as ludicrous, is now acclaimed as
revolutionary. Why?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Over the past two decades, researchers gradually devised techniques
to isolate bone marrow stem cells and grow them in large numbers outside
of the body. Scientists steadily improved the delivery systems for
putting genes into cells; the French group assessed one such delivery
vehicle in mice and dogs, and then optimized it for the children.
Sophisticated DNA tests were developed that allowed researchers to gauge
the persistence of the healthy gene after it was put into animals. These
techniques converged in the repair of the infants' disabled immune
systems. They have enjoyed more than 10 months of health, and while we
wait anxiously for longer-term follow up to determine the ultimate
benefit of the treatment, we must acknowledge it as a clinical success.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Can similar techniques be used to cure other diseases? Laboratory and
animal data suggest a reasonable chance of near-term success of gene
therapy in certain forms of hemophilia. Hemophiliacs lack genes that
make proteins essential for clotting. These patients are usually
protected from severe bleeding by even low amounts of the clotting
proteins. Animal experiments have shown that it is feasible to provide
the healthy gene and achieve beneficial levels of the clotting protein.
Clinical trials in hemophiliacs are underway.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But it is unlikely that the many hundreds of other gene-therapy
experiments begun in cancer and degenerative neurological diseases will
dramatically succeed soon. Here the obstacles are much greater, and the
technology is not in hand to overcome them. In the case of most cancers,
the malignant cells have already spread throughout the body. Effectively
distributing therapeutic genes to liver, lung and bone would require a
quantum leap in delivery techniques. Similarly, we do not know how to
introduce genes throughout the brain and spinal cord in a uniform and
sustained fashion, or to fine-tune their functions, so as to reverse
maladies like Lou Gehrig's disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
As we celebrate the success achieved in France, we should remember
that there are rarely "eureka" moments in science. Athena does not
spring full-born from the head of Zeus. Rather, dreams become reality
through hard labor at the laboratory bench and at the patient's bedside.
Promises are fulfilled by cobbling together increments of knowledge
drawn from the many corners of biology and medicine. A roller coaster
ride is dramatic and dizzying, but ultimately returns us to our starting
point. Genuine scientific progress is made on a steady chugging train
that at times feels frustratingly slow, but delivers us to our
destination.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- In an exciting and long-awaited success, gene
therapy has restored apparently normal immune systems to two French
babies born with a rare, lethal immune disease sometimes called the
"bubble boy disease."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is too soon to know if the babies are cured, experts cautioned.
But the experiment, reported in the journal Science, finally provides
evidence that gene therapy can succeed at a time when skeptics are
harshly criticizing the field.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The clinical benefits we observe had never been achieved before,"
said the physician who performed the gene therapy, Dr. Alain Fischer,
describing his patients' rebound into healthy toddlers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It looks like this really worked," agreed Dr. Jennifer Puck, a
geneticist at the U.S. National Institutes of Health who plans to start
a similar gene-therapy study this fall at Duke University. "This is a
very important milestone."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The babies have SCID, or Severe Combined Immunodeficiency Disease;
their bodies can't make lymphocytes, the immune cells crucial to fight
infection.

It is "the first significant success" in gene therapy in 10 years of

Virus Revives Hopes for Gene Therapy

Primitive AAV Shows Promise
As a Safer Means to Carry

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An apparently harmless virus that's shaped like a soccer ball may give
a boost to the beleaguered field of gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since researchers began injecting patients with new genes to replace
damaged ones about a decade ago, their biggest challenge has been
devising a delivery vehicle that is safe, capable of bearing sufficient
quantities of healthy genes and able to target specific parts of the
body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last year's death of a young man from Arizona, Jesse Gelsinger, in a
University of Pennsylvania gene-therapy experiment highlighted the
potential danger of one of the most commonly used means of delivery --
adenovirus, a genetically engineered form of the cold virus. Attacked by
the body's immune system, adenovirus causes side effects that are
usually temporary flu-like symptoms. In the Gelsinger case, however, the
side effects fatally crippled the patient's lungs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger's death brought about a regulatory crackdown, including
stricter oversight of gene-therapy experiments at the University of
Pennsylvania and elsewhere. But it also sparked a race to create
gene-delivery vehicles that don't provoke an immune response.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A leading contender: the spherical adeno-associated virus, known as
AAV. A number of biotechnology companies are testing AAV, and some have
had results that show promise for patients suffering from a form of
hemophilia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This month, scientists with the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia,
working with the tiny biotech firm Avigen Inc. of Alameda, Calif.,
reported that two of the first three hemophilia patients treated with
minute quantities of AAV-borne genes showed signs of improvement. The
outcome suggested that the virus was effective in getting the genes
where they needed to be, without major side effects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Noting that the results are very preliminary, the Children's Hospital
scientists were excited nonetheless because the experiment was meant to
evaluate only the safety of the experimental therapy, not its
effectiveness.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Elsewhere, Targeted Genetics Corp., based in Seattle, expects to
begin tests of AAV gene therapy involving patients suffering from a more
common form of hemophilia in a year. Cell Genesys Inc., Foster City,
Calif., is considering a similar AAV patient trial.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists are focusing on hemophilia because it is viewed as one of
the most straightforward diseases to treat with gene therapy. People
with hemophilia are missing a gene needed to make one of two key
proteins needed for the blood to clot. Up to several times a week, they
must inject themselves with genetically engineered versions of the
protein to prevent spontaneous internal bleeding. But these medications
are expensive and often don't prevent crippling joint problems caused by
internal bleeding.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With gene therapy, researchers are hoping to use AAV to replace this
defective gene with healthy new ones, so that patients can produce
enough clotting protein on their own.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This method doesn't have to be particularly efficient to work: If the
new genes produce a mere 5% of normal levels of clotting protein, it
should be enough to alleviate most symptoms. By contrast, when dealing
with some other diseases, most or all of the defective cells have to be
corrected for the treatment to work.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Avigen's hemophilia results "are tantalizingly encouraging," says
Savio Woo, president of the American Society of Gene Therapy. Still, the
hemophilia tests are far from a sure thing, and a failure could raise
the question of whether any gene-therapy breakthrough is possible using
currently available technologies. Moreover, even if the AAV concept
works, it may be limited to a handful of diseases and not be useful in
gene-therapy treatments targeting acute diseases such as artery blockage
or advanced cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some scientists argue that none of the existing gene-therapy
technologies are not yet ready for prime time. Merck & Co., for example,
has spent years trying to perfect a gene-delivery approach involving an
improved, second-generation adenovirus, but the company has decided
against patient tests soon. "We think there is a lot more work that
needs to be done" on improving gene-delivery and manufacturing
techniques before such tests begin, says Roger Perlmutter, who heads
discovery research for the drug giant.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, Chiron Corp., Emeryville, Calif., is continuing a
hemophilia gene-therapy trial -- one that doesn't use AAV -- but
recently curtailed much of its other gene-therapy research effort to
reduce spending.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first approach to gene therapy entailed removing defective cells
before the new genes could be put in. That was a logistical quagmire,
and so scientists started looking for ways new genes could be directly
injected into the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
What they came up with was the adenovirus, a respiratory bug that
causes the common cold. With one injection in the lung, liver, or
muscle, it can quickly infect millions of cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By the early 1990s, many scientists across the country rushed to test
this method for terminal cancer, cystic fibrosis, and heart disease,
using genetically engineered adenoviruses that can't replicate inside
the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the downside of adenovirus soon became apparent. Besides the risk
of out-of-control side effects, there was the fact that the immune
system typically kills cells injected with new adenovirus-borne genes
within several weeks, thus limiting the treatment's effectiveness.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A handful of scientists recognized the problems of adenovirus early
on and focused their energies on AAV. One was Barrie Carter of Targeted
Genetics. Another was Avigen's founder, John Monahan. He created Avigen
in 1992 after another gene-therapy company he had worked for showed no
interest in pursuing AAV gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the time, little was known about AAV, and there was great
skepticism about the method. All viruses are primitive in that they
can't reproduce on their own, requiring help from human or animal cells.
But AAV is so primitive that it cannot reproduce except in the presence
of adenovirus -- hence the name adeno-associated virus. With this
limitation, critics said it would be impossible to manufacture AAV in
commercial quantities.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers at Avigen and Targeted Genetics spent years engineering a
way to manufacture AAV. They removed all the viral genes from its
center, leaving an empty viral shell to which a payload of genes to
treat hemophilia or cystic fibrosis could be added. Both companies now
say they have perfected production methods to make enough AAV for human
testing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, in the early 1990s, two academic researchers -- Katherine
High of Children's Hospital and Mark Kay of Stanford University School
of Medicine -- had independently become fascinated with treating
hemophilia patients by gene therapy. Both tried various approaches that
didn't work, and both eventually turned to AAV in frustration.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To their amazement, it worked. "I couldn't believe the data at
first," recalls Dr. Kay about the first time he used AAV to deliver
blood-clotting genes to lab mice. "It was the first time I have done an
experiment that had worked so well I couldn't see what the glitch would
be going forward."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last winter, teams led by Dr. High and Dr. Kay stunned scientists by
showing that a single series of AAV injections could essentially cure
dogs of hemophilia for months at a time. Today, two years after the
initial injections, these dogs are still producing high levels of blood
proteins, with no obvious side effects, Dr. High says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The big question is whether the AAV method can work in people. Drs.
High and Kay have teamed up with Avigen to test AAV in patients with
hemophilia B, while Targeted Genetics is gearing up for human trials of
AAV gene therapy for the more common form of the disease, hemophilia A.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists are cautious because so many previous gene-therapy
treatments that worked in animals have failed in people. Although the
Avigen results seem promising for hemophilia patients, much larger
trials are needed before the effectiveness of AAV can be assessed with
certainty.
</p>

           Delivering New Genes into the Body
  For gene therapy to be successful, researchers need a safe and
efficient way to deliver healthy new genes into the human body. One of
the more promising new vehicles is a genetically engineered version of
AAV, a harmless virus. Here is how AAV gene therapy would work for
treating hemophilia.
  1 In the lab, scientists first remove the viral genes from the AAV
virus.
  2 In place of the viral genes, the human gene -- in this case a gene
that produces blood-clotting proteins -- is inserted inside the virus.
  3 The gene-bearing viruses are delivered into the leg muscle or
liver.  The viral shell protects the clotting gene and helps transport
it to a cell.
  4 Once inside a muscle cell, if all goes well, the new genes will
eventually start producing blood-clotting proteins, alleviating the
symptoms of the disease.

Penn Is Adding Safeguards

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The University of Pennsylvania's gene-therapy program
said it has put in place research safeguards in the hope that federal
officials will allow it to resume human testing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Food and Drug Administration in January put more than six trials
at the Philadelphia school's Institute for Human Gene Therapy on hold.
In September an Arizona teenager died during an experiment there -- the
first death directly linked to gene therapy. A federal investigation
found Penn's program lacking in how it conducted the study.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The program responded with a point-by-point rebuttal conceding some
shortfalls in how it documented its study and its informed-consent
process, but said none of the errors were likely to have affected trial
results. The FDA responded to that response, and Penn returned the
latest volley on Friday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Penn's program seeks to convince the FDA it has proper oversight in
place to prevent the kind of lapses investigators found in the study
that led to the death of Jesse Gelsinger. Among other things, the
program said it is hiring an outside firm to monitor all its human
experiments. The FDA said it would review the letter.

Vical's Stock Falls Sharply on Report
Of Death in Gene-Therapy Experiment
  </b>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Vical Inc. became the latest biotechnology company to take a
gene-therapy roller-coaster ride, as its stock at one point in the day
tumbled 36% on a report that a patient had died in one of its
experiments. By day's end, the stock recovered some of what it had lost.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the highly charged atmosphere surrounding gene therapy -- a field
that has been rocked in recent months by the death of a young patient
and disclosures of poor government oversight -- any negative news can
hurt a company.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yesterday, a Washington Post article noted that a researcher
indicated a patient's death was "probably" related to his participation
in a gene-therapy trial conducted by the company, and that one of the
universities participating in the study had "halted" its participation.
The death and the university's reaction to it were discussed at a public
National Institutes of Health meeting on Wednesday.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At 5:30 a.m. Pacific time, Vical Chief Executive Alain Schreiber got
the first call from an analyst and began dialing his largest
shareholders. In Nasdaq Stock Market trading, the stock of the San
Diegobased company fell to as low as $36.50 from $57.0625 at 4 p.m.
Wednesday. At 4 p.m. Thursday, the stock was at $49.6875, down $7.375,
or 13%, on the day.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Schreiber placated investors, telling them the label "probably"
was chosen only because a researcher couldn't completely rule out the
possibility that an advanced cancer patient didn't die from gene
therapy. The patient's death, in 1999, took place more than two months
after being injected with a gene-therapy drug. The company said it feels
the death was due to the patient's underlying condition. But the
researcher on site was forced to pick among three options -- unrelated,
definitely related, or the middle option, "probably" related, Mr.
Schreiber said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It was the biosafety committee at another site involved in the study
that raised concerns about the death and asked for more information.
While it waited for the information, it chose to stop enrolling new
patients. The committee, at the University of South Florida, Tampa, will
review the information later this month. Research at about 40 other
participating sites continues, Mr. Schreiber said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite the turmoil at Vical, yesterday actually provided potential
relief for companies involved in gene therapy. A pivotal federal
committee agreed to go back to the drawing board in its efforts to
decide how quickly, and in what detail, side effects in gene-therapy
trials should be reported to the National Institutes of Health.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee was torn by dissenting
views about how much was too much. While a subcommittee suggested that
researchers continue providing the NIH with a host of safety reports,
other members of the committee questioned whether the NIH should even be
in the business of collecting such data. When no consensus emerged, the
committee threw the issue back to a working group to be reviewed in time
for the committee's June meeting.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The issue is of vital importance to gene-therapy researchers and
companies, because NIH records generally are open to the public. The
Food and Drug Administration, which also collects similar data, doesn't
release its records.

Health & Science:
Gene Therapy
To Be Given
Tougher Rules

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The federal government said it will require gene-therapy
researchers to submit more detailed information about their experiments
to regulators and acknowledged that the monitoring of some experiments
had been "less than adequate."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Trying to boost public confidence in the embattled gene-therapy
field, the Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of
Health jointly said they were increasing inspections of gene-therapy
trials and would begin a series of special forums to help address
concerns.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA is calling for researchers to routinely submit "monitoring
plans" that detail the steps they take in the experiment process. The
monitors are responsible for making sure patients' rights are being
protected and that the trial is running according to an agreed-upon
plan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Because of recent lapses, the agency said it needs to "take a more
proactive approach" and not simply review the plans after the fact -- or
after a problem comes to light. "These are important steps to ensure
patient safety," said Kathryn Zoon, the FDA official who oversees
gene-therapy regulation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new monitoring rules are designed to avoid the types of problems
evident in recent months as gene therapy came under heavy scrutiny
following the death of an Arizona teenager. The September death of Jesse
Gelsinger is considered the first fatality directly linked to gene
therapy, and it has prompted a wide-ranging review of the science and
regulation behind more than 350 experiments conducted to date. In
addition to serious questions about the way the experiment in the
Gelsinger case was handled, federal officials have taken several
researchers to task for failing to properly report patient safety
information.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jane Henney, head of the FDA, added that the new steps "will help
restore the confidence in the trials' integrity that is essential if
gene-therapy studies are to be able to fulfill their potential."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For its part, the NIH said it would hold quarterly forums to exchange
scientific data. The first such session will take place this week during
a meeting of the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, a special NIH panel
involved in overseeing gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The NIH panel also will hear from a number of researchers looking to
start new experimental procedures, as well as a proposal from
biotechnology critic Jeremy Rifkin, who is calling for an "immediate
moratorium" on most gene-therapy experiments, except in cases where the
experiment can be considered a treatment of last resort for a
life-threatening illness.

FDA Rejects Defense of Gene-Therapy Researcher

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration rejected the defense
offered by a prominent gene-therapy researcher whose experiment is
implicated in a patient's death, and demanded he correct what the agency
identified as violations of federal rules.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, Congress is raising more questions about the FDA itself
and whether it adequately monitored gene-therapy trials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researcher, James Wilson of the University of Pennsylvania's
Institute for Human Gene Therapy, was rapped by federal regulators for a
host of violations in the experiment that led to the death of an Arizona
teenager.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In originally citing Dr. Wilson's institute with a series of
shortcomings, the FDA in January put more than a half-dozen other
experiments being conducted by the Penn center on hold. Penn responded
with a point-by-point rebuttal that conceded some shortfalls in the way
it documented its study and its informed-consent process, but said none
of the errors were likely to have affected the experiment's final
results.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA, in a response late Friday, said that wasn't enough. It sent
Dr. Wilson a formal "warning letter," and kept the institute's studies
on hold. It said Dr. Wilson, one of the most prominent researchers in
the field, had "failed to fulfill" his obligations and "violated
regulations governing the proper conduct of clinical trials."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The death of Arizona teenager Jesse Gelsinger is considered the first
fatality directly linked to the relatively new field of gene therapy,
and it has prompted a wide-ranging review of the science and regulations
behind more than 350 experiments conducted to date.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a 20-page letter, the FDA attacked the institute's defenses on
several points. Among the most important were whether certain monkey
deaths in animal studies were reported properly to the FDA, and whether
Mr. Gelsinger should have participated in the experiment at all. In a
statement, Penn said it was reviewing the letter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Also on Friday, Sen. Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) stepped up his
investigation into federal oversight of gene therapy. In a letter to
Secretary of Health and Human Services Donna Shalala, he questioned how
often the FDA had investigated genetherapy experiments to catch the
types of problems apparent in the Penn experiment. Mr. Frist also
questioned why, given the information the FDA had in its possession, it
waited four months to shut down all of Penn's gene-therapy experiments.

FDA Suspends Series of Gene-Therapy Studies

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The Food and Drug Administration put a hold on a series
of gene-therapy studies sponsored by Vascular Genetics Inc., the latest
effort by the federal agency to get a handle on potential problems in
the field.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA wouldn't give details on why a set of Vascular Genetics
studies, which aim to develop gene-therapy products for the treatment of
vascular disease, was halted. The company would say only it was
providing the agency with information on its results to date. The
company, based in Research Triangle Park, N.C., added that it already
had completed the enrollment and treatment of patients in three studies
and was in the midst of a fourth when the hold letter came from the FDA.
The hold applies to all four studies, although it has only the practical
impact of stoppin g patient enrollment in one.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA is asking a host of questions about the company's results to
date, including questions about patients' conditions before and after
they were treated, a Vascular Genetics official said. "What they asked
is not unreasonable," said company President John Cumming. It also is
asking about the adverse events experienced by patients, including a
small number of patient deaths that the company said weren't linked to
the gene-therapy itself.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While not elaborating on the FDA's concerns, the studies' principal
researcher, Jeffrey Isner of Tufts University, said he was planning to
publicly give details of the results of the research at a scientific
conference. "I am looking forward to the opportunity to present the
results of these trials in two weeks, and at that time I believe the
safety and efficacy will be more than apparent," he said. Dr. Isner also
has an ownership stake in Vascular Genetics.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
William Haseltine, chief executive of Human Genome Sciences Inc.,
added that "there is nothing unusual" in the FDA request and that no
safety problems were seen in the trials. "We haven't seen any adverse
reactions we could attribute to the drug. None at all. Zero," he said."I
don't think it will be long" before the studies will be able to resume.
Human Genome, of Rockville, Md., is a major shareholder in Vascular
Genetics.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since the September death of a patient enrolled in a University of
Pennsylvania gene-therapy experiment, the field has been under a
microscope from public and federal regulators. While federal regulators
have uncovered widespread problems with the proper reporting of
trial-safety data to officials, for the most part they haven't uncovered
major safety problems with the gene-therapy itself.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even so, the FDA and the National Institutes of Health are scrambling
to monitor the field more closely, and many researchers feel the hold on
Vascular Genetics is an outgrowth of that effort.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. said Beth Israel
Deaconess Medical Center resumed its trial on the use of gene therapy to
treat hemophilia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The experiment, involving 12 patients, was suspended two weeks ago
even though no serious side effects had occurred in the trial. The
hospital at the time said it wanted to "hit the pause button" given a
national controversy over the safety of gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We're really pleased that our trial is up and running. There have
been no safety problems associated with the therapy," says company
spokeswoman Justine Koenigsberg.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Transkaryotic, a biotechnology concern, said it supported the
hospital's decision to suspend the trial, which was not harmed by the
hiatus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This past summer, Beth Israel halted a gene-therapy trial for cancer
patients because of a series of adverse events -- including two
unexplained patient deaths. The medical center maintains that there is
no evidence that the deaths, in patients already very sick with cancer,
were caused by the therapy.

Congressional Probes of Gene Therapy
Haven't Slowed Testing of Treatments

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- As Congress intensifies scrutiny of gene-therapy
experiments that have been linked to patient injuries and a death,
testing of similar novel treatments is moving ahead, with a government
panel set to review 10 new procedures next month.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So far, there is little evidence the controversy over the
experimental treatments has dissuaded patients from participating in the
studies. And the FDA has allowed two studies by Schering-Plough Corp. to
resume enrolling patients after the agency temporarily stalled the
trials last year.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"All of my patients have asked me about these things, so they are
well aware of what's going on," said Johannes Vieweg, a researcher at
Duke University involved in three experiments to develop therapies for
prostate and kidney cancer.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The intense scrutiny of gene therapy began last fall with the death
of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger while participating in an experiment at
the University of Pennsylvania -- the first fatality directly linked to
the 10-year-old scientific field. Gene therapy seeks to treat or cure
diseases by replacing or modifying the body's own defective genes. While
built on much hope in the early 1990s, it has yet to develop a cure, and
recent disclosures have tarnished its prospects further.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, researchers continue to move ahead. At a coming meeting of the
National Institutes of Health's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee,
members are set to review 10 new research proposals, while the normal
quarterly meeting brings just one or two, members said. The so-called
RAC committee only publicly reviews proposals it deems novel; the FDA
solely reviews more routine ones.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I thought that the Penn affair would have made people more cautious
about submitting new stuff, but that doesn't seem to be the case," said
RAC member Jon Wolff, a professor from the University of
Wisconsin-Madison Medical School. "Some people continue to push the
envelope. That surprised me."
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One recent disclosure of possible contamination in a gene-therapy
trial turned out to be a false alarm. Last week, St. Jude Children's
Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn., and the FDA said early tests
indicated it was possible a batch of genetic material used in a cancer
gene-therapy trial was contaminated by a hepatitis virus and by HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS. Yesterday, further HIV and hepatitis tests came
back negative, the FDA said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, some trials stalled amid all the questioning have resumed.
Last fall, Schering-Plough temporarily stopped enrolling patients in two
of its experiments involving liver cancer at the FDA's request. In
December, however, Schering-Plough, Madison, N.J., received the green
light from the FDA to restart enrollment of new patients, and has now
done so, the company said.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Congress is stepping up scrutiny of gene-therapy experiments to
determine the extent of problems and whether government oversight should
be intensified.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The House Commerce Committee has launched a bipartisan investigation
into gene-therapy trials, the research institutions that conduct them
and the government's watchdog role. A committee spokesman said that
Chairman Thomas Bliley (R., Va.) doesn't want to be "alarmist," but a
close look at the field is justified by a continuing stream of
disturbing information about experiments.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A spokeswoman for the Inspector General of the Department of Health
and Human Services said that office is likely to launch a probe into why
researchers and their institutions failed to report to the NIH hundreds
of "adverse events" that occurred in clinical trials. In many cases, the
problems, which included injuries to patients, were reported to the Food
and Drug Administration, but not to the NIH. The effort was requested by
Mr. Bliley and Rep. Fred Upton (R., Mich.), chairman of the committee's
oversight and investigations subcommittee.
  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, two Democrats on the committee, Reps. John Dingell of
Michigan and Henry Waxman of California, are compiling a separate report
of previously undisclosed information from NIH that will detail
additional problems. On the Senate side, Bill Frist (R., Tenn) is
considering whether to hold additional hearings into gene-therapy
oversight, saying that it is clear there has been "system-wide failure"
in monitoring the field. Still, he added, "we've got to make sure people
don't shut down research totally, because there is some promise in the
field."

Gene-Therapy Woes
Are More Widespread
Than Prior Data Show

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Problems involving gene-therapy trials are more widespread than
previously disclosed, according to Democratic congressional staffers
reviewing new information provided by the National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The NIH provided the information, which goes beyond what has been
publicly released, to several members of Congress, including Democratic
Reps. John Dingell of Michigan and Henry Waxman of California, both
members of the Commerce Committee. Aides said the data point out
problems in the way some trials have enrolled patients, lapses in
government oversight and a lack of coordination between the NIH and the
Food and Drug Administration, the federal agencies responsible for
overseeing gene-therapy experiments. They said the information indicates
the problems involve more research institutions than previously thought.
And they said it also shows, as previous information has, that
researchers haven't scrupulously reported "adverse events" such as
injuries in gene trials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The review comes amid rising congressional concern about gene-therapy
experiments. Sen. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) is weighing introducing
legislation that would strengthen government oversight of gene-therapy
research and require researchers to provide patients with more
information when they sign up for clinical trials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The furor over gene therapy was ignited last September by the death
of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, the first person whose death was
directly linked to gene therapy. His death is prompting intensified
scrutiny of the field and the more than 300 studies that have been
conducted.

University of Pennsylvania Fires Back
At FDA Over Gene-Therapy Review
</b>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The University of Pennsylvania, under pressure for the
death of an Arizona teenager in a gene-therapy experiment, fired back at
the Food and Drug Administration for the agency's harsh review of its
gene-therapy institution.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While conceding there were some shortfalls in the way it documented
its study and its informed-consent process, university officials and the
Institute for Human Gene Therapy said they "respectfully disagree" with
many of the FDA's main findings. Last month, the FDA halted more than a
half-dozen gene-therapy trials being conducted by the prestigious
institute and its director, James Wilson, citing serious deficiencies
uncovered in an inspection of the experiment that led to the September
death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The bottom line, the university said, was that none of the errors it
acknowledged making were likely to have affected the final results. "We
don't believe there was anything . . . that had any impact on the
unfortunate and tragic death," said Richard Tannen, senior vice dean of
the university's school of medicine. "We don't believe that it was
foreseeable, based on the best scientific information we had."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA said it had received the response and would "factor it into
our overall evaluation" of the university's program.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among the most serious of the FDA's allegations was that the
informed-consent process was inadequate. Paul Gelsinger, Jesse
Gelsinger's father, told a recent Senate subcommittee hearing that he
hadn't been adequately informed about the true risks his son was about
to undertake. "We gave consent, but in no way was it informed," he said.
The FDA had charged that "the consent process was not well-documented
for nine of 18 patients enrolled in the study."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The university conceded that there had been some problems with some
of the informed-consent paperwork but said patients were thoroughly and
adequately informed about the risks. "There were errors, but the
patients absolutely got well-documented informed consent," said Dr.
Tannen. Of 170 consent forms in the study record, the FDA found
documentation problems with 12, "such as witnesses or investigators
signing on the wrong date," the university said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"FDA's criticisms of documentation have been seriously misinterpreted
to mean that informed consent was not given in substance," the
university said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another FDA criticism was that the university changed the study
design -- it modified one of the criteria for accepting patients in the
study -- without FDA approval. The university said that the change was
sent to the FDA as part of a larger study revision and that, in a
conference call, the "FDA indicated that it had reviewed the revised
protocol and gave [the institute] permission to proceed with the study."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Several of the university's responses are similar -- that it did
fully apprise the FDA of study changes and results, even if it failed to
notify the federal agency in the precise time and manner expected.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For example, two patients had liver reactions that should have been
reported to the FDA before the study proceeded to the groups of patients
that included Jesse Gelsinger. The university concedes that the data
should have been submitted in October and November 1998 and that they
should have been discussed with the FDA. Even so, the university said
that it sent the FDA the information in January 1999 and that the FDA
had it "for more than six months prior to August 1999, when it approved
the continuation of the trial."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another of the more serious charges was that the university didn't
properly notify the FDA of monkey deaths in a related study. The
university said the deaths "were not considered significant" to Mr.
Gelsinger's experiment because of different procedures used in the two
studies.

Gene-Therapy Reviews Are Accelerated
Amid New Worries on Trial Tainting
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Chris Adams
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>549 words</div><div>14 February 2000</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Continuing disclosures about problems in gene-therapy
research are prompting an acceleration of federal reviews even as some
administration officials worry that they don't yet have a grip on the
frequency of such problems -- or what to do about them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Food and Drug Administration and the National Institutes of
Health, on orders from President Clinton, are speeding up review of
federal gene-therapy guidelines to see whether changes are needed.
They're looking closely at whether tougher rules are needed on such
matters as the amount of information provided to patients and whether
the informed-consent process needs to be strengthened. They have been
directed to report any recommendations to Health and Human Services
Secretary Donna Shalala as soon as possible.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The presidential directive was issued last week at the same time Mr.
Clinton issued an executive order barring federal agencies from
discriminating against employees on the basis of genetic tests. It is
intended to reflect the administration's determination to get to the
bottom of the problems. But it also highlights the uncertainty over the
extent and nature of the safety problems: Are they limited to a few
research centers or are they much more widespread?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, biotech-industry leaders are raising their own concerns:
that well-publicized problems involving gene-therapy trials could lead
to a political backlash resulting in excessive regulation. "There's a
concern that the current debate could spin out of control," said Carl
Feldbaum, president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The latest blow to the gene-therapy field involves the possible
contamination of a trial conducted by St. Jude Children's Research
Hospital in Memphis, which is being investigated by the FDA. While
hospital and FDA officials stress the results were preliminary and
subject to reversal, early tests indicated it was possible that a batch
of genetic material used in a cancer gene-therapy trial was contaminated
by a hepatitis virus and by HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
St. Jude said that of 19 children participating in the study, just
two young patients could have theoretically been exposed to the material
in question. Both children died last year from the cancer that brought
them into the gene-therapy trial in the first place. St. Jude said
"there is no evidence that any of the children who were treated were
harmed in any way."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The hospital received information on the possible contamination in
December after sending a batch of genetic material out for testing. The
lab sent a follow-up report last month.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The St. Jude researcher, Dr. Laura Bowman, called the chances that
there was real HIV contamination "vanishingly small." Further, there is
a "significant chance" that the results represented false positives,
meaning there was no HIV contamination, she said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even so, an FDA official said the agency was taking the test results
seriously and was "proceeding as though this were a positive." The
agency is investigating the hospital's clinical procedures, and put its
trial on hold until the investigation is completed. Further testing on
the genetic material in question should be done in about two weeks. The
problems were reported Friday by the Washington Post.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nineteen young brain cancer patients may have been exposed to the AIDS virus while taking part in a human gene therapy experiment at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, once more raising questions about oversight of the experimental treatments. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To make matters worse, researchers discovered the potential problem in December but waited until last week to report it to government monitors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This latest setback for the fledgling gene therapy field, first reported in The Washington Post, comes less than six months after the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger during another gene treatment at the University of Pennsylvania. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And it follows recent reports that more than 650 deaths and other "adverse effects" among gene therapy patients were not reported by researchers to the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are very concerned, because we stand to lose the public's trust, and if that happens, we all lose," said Dr. Savio Woo of Mount Sinai Medical Center, president of the American Society for Gene Therapy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Not only the investigators will lose, but the public will also lose, because this is a most promising new avenue of medical research." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new problems emerged in a clinical study being conducted by Dr. Laura Bowman at St. Jude's and Dr. Malcolm Brenner at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Recent tests on genetically engineered viruses previously injected into volunteer patients at St. Jude's showed that they may have been contaminated by HIV-1, the virus that causes AIDS, and by HCV, which causes hepatitis C. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though followup tests by the Food and Drug Administration may show there was no contamination, the study has been shut down by the FDA. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We really need to determine whether this is a true positive result," an FDA official said. "In many cases where there are positive preliminary findings, those findings are not confirmed on further testing." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most of the 25 volunteers taking part in the experiments at St. Jude's and Baylor have died from their cancer, a brain malignancy called neuroblastoma. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The surviving patients and their families were not informed of the possible HIV contamination until Thursday, when the researchers realized The Post knew about the problem. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in a statement posted on its Web site Friday, St. Jude's said there is "no evidence that any patient received vaccine that was contaminated." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We always planned to inform the parents when the final results are available," the statement said. "The incorrect information that has been in the media over the last 24 hours reinforced the decision made yesterday that the patients and parents had to be informed immediately so that they had access to correct information." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Baylor spokeswoman Claire Bassett stated that none of the six patients treated there received any of the suspect genetic material. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There are 157 gene therapy experiments currently underway in the U.S., and the lag in reporting adverse effects seems endemic to the field. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woo said two factors contribute to the underreporting problem. One is a widespread belief among investigators that they don't have to report adverse effects to the NIH unless they are directly related to the gene therapy. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet most of the medical problems that afflict gene therapy patients are caused by their underlying diseases. To date, out of about 4,000 patients who have undergone experimental gene therapy, Gelsinger is the only one whose death has been officially linked to his treatments. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woo also said the NIH and FDA need to come up with "a completely harmonized set of reporting requirements." Confusion among researchers about what has to be reported and when and to which agency creates a "breeding ground for breaches of reporting requirements." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Communication between the FDA and the NIH has been flawed. Though gene therapy has been around for 10 years, the FDA didn't start sending its own adverse event reports to the NIH until December in the wake of Gelsinger's death. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Appearing before a Senate subcommittee earlier this month, Jay Siegel, director of the FDA's Office of Therapeutics Research and Review, said patient safety must begin with the researchers. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While many of these new gene therapy and biotech products may have yet unknown risks, they also have potential for tremendous patient benefit," Siegel said. "When developing these new products, sponsors of clinical trials must accept responsibility to ensure that participants are not exposed to unknown reasonable risks and the experimental products are as safe as possible." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Paul Gelsinger, Jesse's father, addressed the same panel. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It looked safe," he said of the experiment that killed his son. "It was presented as safe. I encouraged my son to do this. But I wasn't given all the information. And some of the information I was given was not true."  </p>

Hospital Halts Trial
Using Gene Therapy
To Treat Hemophilia

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
BOSTON -- Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center said it had temporarily
suspended a 12-person trial on the use of gene therapy to treat
hemophilia even though the experiment had caused no serious side effects
in patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We felt it was better to hit the pause button and hear the national
discussion on gene therapy," hospital President Michael Rosenblatt said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The suspension of the hemophilia trial, reported in yesterday's
Boston Globe, follows the hospital's decision last summer to halt a
gene-therapy experiment for cancer patients. That trial was suspended
because of a series of adverse events -- including two unexplained
patient deaths. The medical center maintains there is no evidence that
the deaths of the patients, who already were sick with cancer, were
caused by the therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Transkaryotic Therapies Inc., of Cambridge, Mass., which sponsored
the trial, said it supports the hospital's decision, but expects the
program will be up and running again soon.

Safety of Gene Therapy Is Subject
Of Inquiry By Senate Committee
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Chris Adams
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>752 words</div><div>4 February 2000</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- In their attempt to understand whether gene therapy is
truly safe, some congressional and federal officials are wondering
whether other patients -- besides Jesse Gelsinger -- could have died
from the experimental procedure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While top gene-therapy experts' working assumption is that the
Arizona teenager was indeed the first to die, they concede they can't be
certain. Researchers indicated some deaths were "possibly" related to
the gene therapy itself, as opposed to a patient's underlying disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For example, Introgen Therapeutics Inc., of Houston, reported to the
National Institutes of Health that in one study two deaths couldn't
conclusively be explained, leaving open the "possibility" they were
related to the gene therapy itself. However, in the final analysis, the
company has "very little concern that the gene therapy could have been
involved," an Introgen official said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Patients in gene-therapy trials usually have life-threatening, often
terminal illnesses. "Patients in those trials die," Jay Siegel, a Food
and Drug Administration official, told a Senate hearing this week. "And
it is usually not possible to make a definitive determination" about the
cause of death.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It may well appear that the death is due to progression of the
cancer," he added. "But one cannot make definitive determination as to
whether the therapy may in some way have increased that likelihood."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the hearing, Sen. Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) grilled regulators about
whether there were more deaths related to the gene therapy itself among
the 4,000 or so participants in the experiments. Since Mr. Gelsinger's
death in September, the scientific field has been engaged in a
wide-ranging review of its past experiments, and researchers have
swamped the NIH with reports about any "adverse events" -- including
death -- among study participants.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Introgen experiment shows how difficult it is to always make a
concrete call about cause of death. About three years ago, in one of the
company's trials that introduced genes into the body to attack cancer
cells, a patient received five doses of a conventional chemotherapy drug
as well as the gene therapy. Two days after his last dose of the gene
therapy, the patient went to the emergency room, complaining of
shortness of breath, the company said. He died 30 days later, and "in
the investigator's opinion [the lung problems] . . . could possibly be
related to study treatment." An autopsy wasn't performed, NIH records
show.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The point is, the patient had worsening disease and a worsening
chest X-ray, and this was in the general area the treatment was being
administered," said James A. Merritt, vice president of clinical affairs
for Introgen, who also noted that all the participants were seriously
ill cancer patients. "You cannot exclude that there may have been some
contribution to his shortness of breath, the complication he had
immediately prior to death."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A second patient in the study died 19 days after his only dose of the
gene therapy. The cause of death was unknown, and no autopsy was
performed, Dr. Merritt said. The researchers suspected the man's cancer
killed him, although complications "possibly related to [the gene
transfer] cannot be ruled out," they reported to the NIH.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Essentially, there was no way to establish a cause of death," Dr.
Merritt said. While there was "absolutely no information in the record
that would lead us to suspect it was the drug, it had to be included as
a possible cause," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Likewise, researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in
Boston indicated that two study deaths were "possibly" related to gene
therapy, although they ultimately concluded there was "no evidence" to
link the gene therapy to the deaths. Essentially, the center said
participants were so sick that it became difficult to tell what caused
their deaths. The hospital said it needed to change its study design "to
enroll healthier patients so they could determine whether adverse events
were related to the gene or to the health of the patient."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even with the ambiguity, gene-therapy experts say the experiments
have been generally safe, although they say limits should be set on the
use of some types of therapy on certain patients. "There have been
toxicities, there have been adverse events," said Inder Verma, a leading
researcher. But the only death so far that has been directly linked to
the gene therapy, he said, is Jesse Gelsinger's.

Regulators Plan

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Federal regulators are planning to increase the
oversight of gene therapy and possibly boost the amount of information
publicly available about the embattled practice, which an important
senator said was being poorly overseen by government officials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A Senate subcommittee also heard testimony yesterday from Paul
Gelsinger, the father of the Arizona teenager who died undergoing an
experimental procedure in September -- the first death directly linked
to gene therapy. Jesse Gelsinger's death, and charges that researchers
improperly conducted the experimental procedure, triggered a
wide-ranging examination of the young field and the regulators who
oversee it.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger said he and his son were poorly informed about the
risks Jesse was about to undertake in the experiment. Until recently,
Mr. Gelsinger had publicly defended the University of Pennsylvania
researchers who injected his son with a genetically modified virus in
hopes of developing treatments for a rare liver disorder.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I lost all confidence in these men, and I had so much in them," Mr.
Gelsinger said of the Penn researchers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sen. Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) said repeatedly during the hearing that
the field of gene therapy suffered from a lack of oversight. Officials
at the National Institutes of Health, for example, recently concluded
that only 6% of so-called adverse events in one type of gene-therapy
trial were properly reported to the NIH. While blaming researchers for
neglecting to follow federal guidelines, the NIH also shouldered part of
the blame for not n oticing that so few reports were coming in from the
dozens of experiments under way across the country.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While there have been many deaths among gene-therapy participants --
some of which raised questions -- the FDA said, all but Jesse
Gelsinger's were ultimately linked to the patients' underlying disease,
and not the gene-therapy procedure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA said it planned to conduct more inspections to increase
oversight of gene-therapy experiments. The agency also plans to issue a
proposed rule to provide more information on gene-therapy trials to the
public. While the FDA is prohibited by law from releasing most
information on specific experiments, agency officials say the law may
allow them to increase disclosure of some information.

Health Institutes
Redoubles Scrutiny
Of Gene Therapy
</b>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The National Institutes of Health is redoubling efforts
to oversee gene therapy, paying particular attention to potential
financial conflicts of interest among researchers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the same time, it acknowledged partial blame for the widespread
underreporting of deaths and other serious adverse events in
gene-therapy trials, according to a letter to Congress.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, the NIH has asked the Department of Health and Human
Services' inspector general to review the circumstances that led to an
"inaccurate" letter being sent to several gene-therapy researchers about
the agency's reporting requirements. The May 1996 letter told
researchers they didn't have to submit certain data about their
experiments to the NIH, even though NIH rules at the time required them
to do so. The letters were sent on the authority of an NIH official who
later went to the University of Pennsylvania-one of the institutions
that received the letter.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last month, the NIH indicated it was reviewing the circumstances of
the letter. Now, "because of the seriousness of this matter," it has
been referred to the inspector general for review, the NIH said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The information was contained in a letter to U.S. Rep. Henry Waxman
(D., Calif.), who last month wrote to the NIH's acting director, Ruth
Kirschstein, about federal oversight of gene therapy. Rep. Waxman's
inquiry was prompted by last September's death of a teenager in a
gene-therapy experiment at the University of Pennsylvania.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Experts estimate hundreds of patients in gene-therapy trials have
died, but, for the most part, the deaths have been determined to be
related to the patients' underlying conditions, not the gene therapy.
September's death of Jesse Gelsinger was the first directly linked to
the gene therapy, and it triggered a wide-ranging examination of the way
federal regulators oversee the field and into the conduct of researchers
running more than 300 genetherapy experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today, a Senate subcommittee led by Sen. Bill Frist (R., Tenn.) is
expected to hear from Jesse Gelsinger's father, as well as gene-therapy
experts and federal officials who oversee the field.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among the topics discussed will be the widespread failure to report
information on adverse events -- deaths and other illnesses -- that take
place in gene therapy trials. Researchers have been required to report
such information promptly to the NIH, although most in recent years have
failed to do so. From all indications, the information was properly
reported to the Food and Drug Administration, which has more direct
oversight over the field.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some researchers have recently been criticized for ties to for-profit
companies that may prompt them to rush clinical trials. An NIH official
said the agency was looking at any financial ties that could bias or
influence the proper design of a gene therapy trial.

Patient Deaths Spurred Boston Hospital
To Reconsider Gene-Therapy Study
</b>
</div><div class="author">

</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>574 words</div><div>1 February 2000</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A gene-therapy trial conducted by Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center
in Boston was suspended last summer after a series of adverse events --
including two patients' deaths that possibly were related to the trial
-- caused the institution to question whether researchers could tell if
the procedure was safe.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While the researcher leading the studies indicated two deaths were
"possibly" related to the gene-therapy procedure, he ultimately
concluded they were not, according to National Institutes of Health
records. The medical center also says there is "no evidence" the deaths
were a result of the gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patients enrolled in the study were all dying from cancer and had
exhausted all other treatment options, making it difficult to determine
whether the gene therapy had hastened their death or their underlying
conditions were to blame.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even so, Beth Israel, a teaching hospital affiliated with Harvard
Medical School, decided to stop the study, saying its whole purpose --
testing the safety of the gene-transfer procedure -- was moot if
researchers were unable to determine the cause of a patient's death.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Information on the deaths was released at a public NIH meeting on
gene therapy in December, and was expanded upon in a report yesterday by
the Washington Post.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The patients were so sick that [researchers] were unable to
determine if the adverse event was related to the disease or the gene
therapy," Beth Israel spokesman Bill Schaller said. The hospital decided
it needed to change its study design "to enroll healthier patients so
they could determine whether adverse events were related to the gene or
to the health of the patient."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Food and Drug Administration, which has direct oversight of the
experiment, did not ask that the trial be stopped, as it has done for
other gene-therapy studies, Mr. Schaller said. In the past several
months, the developing field has been rocked by the death of an Arizona
teenager who was participating in a gene-therapy trial at the University
of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The FDA has shut down several other
gene-therapy trials out of concern for patients' safety.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A Senate subcommittee is scheduled to hold a hearing on gene therapy
tomorrow. One issue will be researchers' widespread failure to report
adverse events to NIH officials, as they are required to do. A letter
from NIH to Congress, which became public in early January, showed only
39 of 691 adverse events examined were properly reported by researchers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the case of the Beth Israel experiment, the lead researcher,
Richard Junghans, didn't report the adverse events to the NIH
immediately, a Beth Israel spokesman said, adding that he did report
them to the FDA when they occurred. The spokesman also said Dr. Junghans
notified the NIH of the deaths and other adverse events in an annual
report.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An NIH report summarizing the events said one occurred two hours
after a patient received a dose of genetically modified cells. The
patient "experienced mild chest pain," NIH records show. Two days later,
the patient was due to receive an outpatient transfusion but didn't keep
the appointment, and was later found dead at home.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The report stated that the researcher "feels that the death is
possibly related to the study medication" but "it should be noted that
the patient had a history of . . . heart disease."

Health & Science:
Congress, University to Study Problems
Leading to Death in Gene-Therapy Test

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Both Congress and the University of Pennsylvania promise
to explore apparent shortcomings in the gene-therapy death of an Arizona
teenager.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Friday, the Food and Drug Administration halted more than a
half-dozen gene-therapy trials being conducted by Penn's prestigious
Institute for Human Gene Therapy. All experiments being overseen by the
institute and its director, James Wilson, were put on indefinite hold
because of serious deficiencies uncovered in an inspection of the
experiment that led to the September death of 18-year-old Jesse
Gelsinger.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In response, Penn said it was appointing a high-level committee of
scientists not affiliated with the university to review the institute's
oversight and monitoring of clinical trials. The committee will report
directly to the president of the Philadelphia-based university, Judith
Rodin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the same time, a Senate public-health subcommittee is planning to
hold a hearing on Wednesday that will include testimony from Jesse
Gelsinger's father, Paul; FDA and National Institutes of Health
officials; and other gene-therapy experts. Penn's Dr. Wilson was invited
to speak but declined.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Recent events also appear to have caused a change of heart by Paul
Gelsinger, who previously had steadfastly supported the actions of the
Penn researchers and their leader, Dr. Wilson. Now, however, Paul
Gelsinger said that "everybody was wrong" and that he has retained an
attorney.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While not willing to elaborate, he said, "Obviously, if I have legal
counsel, that should say a lot . . . I can't go any further at this
point. I'll have a lot to say to the Senate."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Following up on a preliminary investigation released late last year,
the FDA detailed a host of problems with the experiment that resulted in
the death of Jesse Gelsinger -- the first death linked directly to the
relatively young field of gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger was a patient in a genetherapy experiment designed to
treat his rare liver disorder. His death stunned the gene-therapy
scientific community and cast a shadow over the entire field.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among other things, the FDA said the Penn research team did a poor
job of documenting the informed-consent forms that patients must sign
before being enrolled in such an experiment. In addition, the FDA said
the research team enrolled a patient who didn't meet eligibility
criteria and didn't inform the agency, in a timely manner, of monkey
deaths related to the experiment. Further, the FDA said the research
team continued the experiment even after patients experienced problems
that could have mandated a halt to the trial.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Perhaps most seriously, the FDA said that Penn's gene-therapy
institute "does not have a standard operating procedure to conduct a
clinical study." Because of that, Penn didn't have procedures in place
that would have let it better monitor the results of the Gelsinger
experiment and communicate them with the proper oversight officials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In December, the Penn researchers acknowledged they should have
informed the FDA sooner about certain patient reactions, although they
said there was nothing in earlier stages of the experiment that would
have predicted Mr. Gelsinger's death.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Phil Noguchi, an FDA official who oversees gene-therapy trials, said
an additional seven trials will be halted for "as long as it takes" for
the institute to come into compliance with FDA rules.

Gene Therapy Researchers Disagree
With Government Over Possible Lapses

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
BETHESDA, Md. -- In the first day of government hearings on the safety
of gene therapy, researchers argued the experimental therapies have
proved generally safe, though federal officials and a University of
Pennsylvania scientist disagreed over possible lapses in a recent
experiment that killed an Arizona teenager.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The crowded meeting of the National Institutes of Health's
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee was held to discuss gene-therapy
safety following the September death of Jesse Gelsinger, the first
fatality directly linked to the therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Federal officials listened to details about several experiments using
the same general type of adenovirus as that used in the Penn trial to
administer therapeutic genes to test subjects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The death in the Penn study has prompted concerns that the adenovirus
might produce serious immune-system reactions and that researchers may
have rushed too soon into human trials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers conducting these and other experiments said they had
observed hints of liver toxicity or other adverse events from using the
adenovirus. Even so, researchers said other studies hadn't uncovered any
reason to expect a reaction remotely as serious as Mr. Gelsinger's. Penn
researchers are scheduled to detail their experiment's findings today.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials said they were
concerned by two "protocol deviations" that took place in the Penn
experiment. Mr. Gelsinger was being treated for a rare liver disorder
characterized by elevated levels of ammonia in the bloodstream. He died
as a result of an apparent immune-system reaction to the adenovirus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a news conference after the daylong meeting, an FDA official said
one of the agency's "very preliminary" findings was that Mr. Gelsinger's
ammonia level before the therapy was higher than Penn researchers and
the FDA had agreed would be allowed. Mr. Gelsinger's ammonia was at an
acceptable level when he was picked for the study, but it had risen by
the time he was to receive the therapy. The FDA official also said the
Penn team failed properly to report significantly elevated liver-enzyme
levels in two patients who received the therapy before Mr. Gelsinger.
That information could have prompted a halt to the trial, the FDA said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
James Wilson, head of Penn's Institute for Human Gene Therapy, told
reporters he is "fully comfortable" with his team's decision to reduce
Mr. Gelsinger's ammonia levels and then proceed with the trial. Dr.
Wilson said the FDA was supplied with "comprehensive data" on toxicity
levels of the patients in question eight months before Mr. Gelsinger's
death.

Panel Set to Debate
Boosting Oversight
Of Gene Therapy

</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>416 words</div><div>3 December 1999</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The National Institutes of Health is convening a panel
to determine whether the oversight of genetherapy experiments should be
beefed up.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The move follows the September death of Arizona teenager Jesse
Gelsinger in a high-profile gene-therapy experiment, as well as concerns
that some researchers aren't properly reporting deaths or other adverse
reactions in their studies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The panel, brought together by NIH Director Harold Varmus, will
review the 1996 decision to downgrade the status of a special panel
called the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. Known as the RAC, the
committee several years before was charged with bringing public
oversight to the field of gene therapy, which seeks to treat illnesses
by replacing or modifying a body's defective genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For years, the RAC wielded the power to approve or reject every
gene-therapy proposal in the country. But in 1996, at the urging of
biotech companies, researchers, AIDS activists and patients' advocates,
Dr. Varmus proposed abolishing the RAC, saying its function duplicated
the Food and Drug Administration's approval authority.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the face of criticism from RAC supporters, Dr. Varmus dropped
efforts to eliminate the committee. But he restricted its reviews to the
most novel or controversial experiments. The RAC reviews about 10% of
gene-therapy proposals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Varmus said the RAC's current role is on target and the 1996 move
was necessary. "But there are people who think the events of the past
few months might not have occurred if the RAC still had the authority it
once had," he said, adding, "I don't believe that's true."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Wednesday Dr. Varmus wrote to Sen. Bill Frist, (R., Tenn.), who
had questioned his agency's oversight of gene therapy, saying he was
taking several steps to ensure researchers comply with NIH rules for
reporting deaths and other adverse events. Among other things, Dr.
Varmus said the agency is investigating whether two researchers violated
federal rules by not immediately reporting deaths in their studies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, University of Pennsylvania researchers in Philadelphia
conducting the study that led to Mr. Gelsinger's death said Wednesday
that the experimental drug they used-a modified cold virusstarted an
"unusual and deadly immunesystem response that led to multiple organ
failure." But they added that there were no hints that would have led
them to halt the experiment, and "no evidence of human error in his
clinical management."

NIH Parley to Scrutinize Gene-Therapy Death
---
Teenager's Fate Sets Off Debate About Future of the Field
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Robert Langreth and Chris Adams
</div><div>Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>1952 words</div><div>26 November 1999</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists from across the country will converge on the National
Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md., for a three-day meeting beginning
Dec. 8 to scrutinize the death of a teenager, Jesse Gelsinger, in an
experimental genetic-treatment study.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger was the last of 18 people in a University of
Pennsylvania study to undergo an experimental genetic treatment, called
gene therapy. The 17 people before him came out relatively unscathed.
Mr. Gelsinger died, the first fatality linked to gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 18-year-old's death, on Sept. 17, has stunned the gene-therapy
scientific community and cast a shadow over the entire field.
Researchers are struggling to explain exactly what happened and to
determine whether other deaths could occur in numerous gene-therapy
trials that are still going on.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It has also set off an emotional and contentious debate among
scientists, physicians and federal regulators that touches on everything
from whether gene therapy as a research field and business endeavor is
as promising as was once thought, to whether potential side effects and
even deaths in other gene-therapy experiments have been kept secret from
the public by institutions, companies or scientists.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The December meeting of the NIH's Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee
is sure to be among the most significant ever. The field was born amid
great hoopla in 1990, as scientists proposed to correct defective genes
by replacing them with healthy new ones. But despite hundreds of human
trials, gene therapy has yet to yield a cure or even a proven treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the meeting, the committee will grapple with why Mr. Gelsinger
died from the treatment when others didn't and whether he should have
been part of the experiment at all. But they also will explore whether
numerous other human trials involving similar gene-delivery methods are
safe.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At issue is a particular type of virus, adenovirus, which is often
used as a vehicle to insert new genes into the body, in an attempt to
repair a genetic defect or to treat diseases such as cancer. In Mr.
Gelsinger's case, a high dose of adenovirus conveying new genes was
delivered directly into a main blood vessel in his liver on Sept. 13.
Four days later, he died, apparently as a result of a reaction to the
treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
James Wilson, the research scientist who heads the University of
Pennsylvania's Institute for Human Gene Therapy, says his team has
developed some specific explanations for Jesse's death, but has not yet
been able to reproduce what happened by experimenting with animals.
Until the precise details of Mr. Gelsinger's death are nailed down,
however, "we should be extremely cautious" about conducting any
gene-therapy trial in which adenovirus is injected into the bloodstream,
Dr. Wilson says. An adenovirus is a form of respiratory virus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The NIH session will detail the results of a massive review of every
adenovirus study now under way -- indeed, data are still streaming in.
Already, some 70 academic and corporate sponsors of various research
protocols have notified the NIH of their own study results, and whether
they saw the kind of adverse reactions seen in the Gelsinger case. There
have been concerns among researchers that the adenovirus might cause
inflammation of organs. "There are researchers who say we never see any
inflammation at all to ones who say we've seen it occasionally," says
Philip Noguchi, a Food and Drug Administration official with oversight
over genetherapy tests.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger's family says its belief in the doctors and the
experiment has rarely wavered, although they are still waiting for some
answers. It was just three weekends ago that Paul Gelsinger climbed
Mount Wrightson in southern Arizona to scatter his son's ashes.
Accompanying him were the teenager's siblings, friends -- and
physicians.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jesse knew from the start that the University of Pennsylvania project
wasn't going to cure his illness, a rare liver disorder caused by a
defective gene, his father says. He participated because he wanted to
help others. "My kid went out so pure, you can't believe it," Mr.
Gelsinger says. "He never hesitated."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The first sign that Jesse had a problem came at the age of two years
and nine months, when he began refusing to eat anything high in protein.
The toddler had extreme mood swings, and sometimes was unusually
lethargic. The family doctor concluded that Jesse was probably anemic
and needed a high-protein diet, so the Gelsingers bulked him up on
peanut butter, bacon and other protein-rich foods.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One Saturday morning soon after the doctor's appointment, the child
got up to watch cartoons, fell asleep and couldn't be waked. "We ended
up putting him into a coma" as a result of the protein-packed diet, his
father says. He was rushed to the hospital and came out of the coma
after a day. He spent 11 days at the hospital and was ultimately
diagnosed with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, a rare condition
that prevented his body from digesting nitrogen in food protein and
flooded his bloodstream with dangerously high levels of ammonia, which
could send him into a coma and kill him.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For years, Jesse took several drugs -- sodium benzoate and amino
acids, among other things -- to help absorb excess ammonia, and he
strictly limited his protein consumption. As he got older, he had to
take an increasing number of pills -- some days as many as 50.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There were three terrifying crises over the years during which Jesse
slipped into a coma and had to be hospitalized. After the most recent --
last December -- he switched to a new medicine and a new protein-free
nutritional formula. Previously, he was so thin that friends nicknamed
him "Burnsie" after the rail-thin boss, Mr. Burns, on "The Simpsons"
television show. But with the new treatment, he had a hearty appetite
and gained 40 pounds, his father says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
His doctor, Randall Heidenreich at the University of Arizona, had
heard about the clinical trial under way at Penn, and mentioned it to
Jesse during the boy's semiannual visit in September 1998. "A lot of my
patients are always asking me, `Is there any new treatment out there?
Any cure?'" Dr. Heidenreich says. "The Gelsingers were like everybody
else, and always asked."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The young man and his father were intrigued, Mr. Gelsinger says, but
there was a hitch: Participants had to be 18 years old. Jesse was still
17.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The subject came up again last April -- two months shy of Jesse's
18th birthday -- and Mr. Gelsinger carefully read literature that Dr.
Heidenreich obtained from Penn. Father and son hoped to learn that the
experimental therapy might be a cure. But the literature quickly
dispelled that notion. This was an initial clinical trial designed not
to test effectiveness but simply to confirm the safety of the treatment.
The ultimate goal -- in future trials -- would be to use the gene
therapy as a "rescue treatment" for infants and children who were having
crises and needed to have their ammonia levels lowered quickly. Because
the new genes were eliminated from the body in a matter of weeks to
months, there was no possibility of a cure without further advances in
the gene-delivery technology.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I read the literature and said to Jesse, `This is not a cure,'" his
father says. "I told him, `This is a wonderful thing they are doing.
They are trying to save people.' I said, `There is no real benefit for
you.'" However, Mr. Gelsinger adds, "from the get-go, he wanted to
participate. He was excited and enthusiastic. He was looking long term"
to gene therapy's future.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger, who works as a handyman, told Jesse that the treatment
involved risks, including the possibility of dying; the doctors were
also upfront about the risks. "We looked at it and said there are risks,
but they're pretty slim -- one in 5,000, one in 10,000," Mr. Gelsinger
says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One thing Penn didn't mention on its patient-consent form is that an
earlier version of the adenovirus had produced some troubling results in
experiments in monkeys, Mr. Gelsinger says. Specifically, at very high
doses -- far higher than were being given to human patients in the trial
-- monkeys had died or had suffered liver damage. Mr. Gelsinger says,
however, knowing that fact wouldn't have deterred him or his son. The
researchers' "intent was as pure as my son's," he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Sept. 9, Jesse flew alone from his home in Tucson, Ariz., to
Philadelphia to undergo the treatment. Mr. Gelsinger, who planned to fly
in later, drove Jesse to the airport, gave him a hug and told him how
proud he was.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Jesse underwent a series of tests the next day, and the treatment
began early on the morning of the 13th, when a genetically modified
adenovirus was injected via a catheter into a main blood vessel in
Jesse's liver.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Later that day, a Penn physician involved in the trial called Mr.
Gelsinger to say all was well. He spoke with his son that night at
10:30. It was their last conversation. Jesse said he had a fever and
wasn't feeling well, but that wasn't surprising because adenovirus often
produces temporary flu-like symptoms.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At 10 the next morning, Mr. Gelsinger got a call from the doctor
saying there were complications. The young man had jaundice, a possible
harbinger of liver failure and a symptom that hadn't surfaced in any
other patients. The doctor said he was concerned and would keep him
posted.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Several hours later, Mr. Gelsinger learned that Jesse's condition had
worsened. Two hours after that, there was a third call from another
doctor: His ammonia level had risen alarmingly. Mr. Gelsinger caught the
last flight out of Arizona that night. When he approached Jesse's
hospital room the next morning, he says, "there was a lot of activity"
around the bed, and he learned that his son had slipped into a coma
hours earlier.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Early in the morning of Sept. 16, Jesse was hooked up to an
artificial lung in a last-ditch effort to save him. But by that point it
was too late -- several of his organs had failed. The next day, Mr.
Gelsinger reluctantly gave doctors permission to turn off the
life-support machines.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists at the University of Pennsylvania halted the trial and
immediately notified the FDA and the NIH about Jesse's death. Next came
the call for any similar gene-therapy reactions, the results of which
will be presented in December.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Soon after, as a precautionary measure, the government told
Schering-Plough Corp., which was not involved in the Penn trial, to stop
enrolling new patients in a gene-therapy trial for cancer involving
adenovirus, until an inquiry into Jesse's death was completed. Recently
released documents show that three patients in those studies have
suffered side effects such as changes in liver function and, in one
case, a stroke, after receiving genetherapy treatments; it has not been
determined conclusively whether the side effects were related to the
gene transfer itself or to the patients' underlying conditions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Gelsinger continues to agonize about whether he should have let
Jesse go to Philadelphia alone. "The only thing I regret is not being on
that airplane with him," Mr. Gelsinger says, "so I could have been there
with him when he went into his coma. It must have been awful for him"
without his family there.

Committee Pushes to Regain Authority
Over Experiments in Gene Therapy
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Chris Adams
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>1107 words</div><div>26 November 1999</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- Concerned about potential lapses in the oversight of
gene therapy, a little-known government committee is making a push to
reclaim some of the authority it reluctantly ceded to the Food and Drug
Administration three years ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even before the startling news emerged in September that 18-year-old
Jesse Gelsinger had died while in a gene-therapy experiment, the
Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or RAC, was reasserting its role in
the oversight of gene therapy because of concerns that patient safety
wasn't adequately protected in gene-therapy clinical trials. But Mr.
Gelsinger's death has given the RAC's efforts new momentum.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The RAC, which advises the National Institutes of Health, is making a
pitch to get an earlier look at proposed gene-therapy studies.
Currently, the committee gets study designs from researchers at the same
time as the FDA. But under proposed rules, the RAC could get the studies
when researchers seek permission from their local university review
boards, and before any patients are enrolled.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That would give the RAC an opportunity to challenge a researcher's
plan well before the FDA even sees it. "We want our discussion to be
early enough that it's valuable," says Claudia Mickelson of the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and chairwoman of the RAC.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another proposal from the RAC, published in the Federal Register this
week, is intended to clear up any confusion about what researchers must
report to the committee. Recently, it was discovered that some deaths in
gene-therapy experiments were immediately reported to the FDA, as
required, but not to the RAC. The FDA is required by law to keep such
information secret.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The proposed rules specify that any new deaths or serious illnesses
need to be reported to the RAC within 15 days, whether or not the
researcher says it was related to the experiment itself. French
Anderson, director of the Gene Therapy Laboratories at the University of
Southern California School of Medicine and one of the pioneers in the
field, said there have probably been hundreds of deaths of patients in
gene-therapy experiments -- deaths not related to the experiments but
instead to patients' underlying conditions -- that weren't immediately
reported to the RAC in recent years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Neither proposal would grant the RAC the authority it once had, in
which it could recommend to the director of the NIH approval or
rejection of any gene-therapy experiment in the U.S. Under changes made
three years ago, the RAC now reviews about 10% of the studies up for
consideration. The rest go directly to the FDA and the RAC declines a
full, public review of them.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The only way the RAC will be taken seriously is if researchers know
they have to come to it for approval," says LeRoy Walters, a professor
of ethics at Georgetown University and former RAC chairman.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Walters and 14 other former RAC members have written NIH Director
Harold Varmus and Secretary of Health Donna Shalala complaining the FDA
allowed changes to researchers' plans -- including the one involving the
death of Mr. Gelsinger -- without alerting the RAC. "We urge you to . .
. reassure both the public and policymakers that all major changes in
protocols will be promptly and publicly reported," the letter read.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But many in the scientific and biotechnology community oppose the
idea of reinstating the RAC's approval authority. "We flatly reject that
there needs to be another regulatory agency here," says Michael Werner,
bioethics counsel for the Biotechnology Industry Organization.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Historically, the RAC and the FDA have concentrated on different
aspects of gene therapy. While the FDA has generally been more focused
on the science, the RAC -- populated by ethicists and other
nonscientists -- has delved more deeply into ethical issues. The FDA
process is closed to the public, whereas the RAC was created to foster
public discussion of broad policy concerns as well as the merits of
specific experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
FDA officials like the idea of submitting studies to the RAC earlier
because it would prevent last-minute hitches that could hold up a study.
"I do think they are moving more and more toward a role that is more
critical," says Philip Noguchi, the FDA official who oversees
gene-therapy experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The RAC "still has enormous influence and that will become very clear
in the coming weeks" as it reviews the Gelsinger case and other matters,
says Dr. Anderson. "The RAC is there to provide public confidence, and
things are a little shaky right now."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The RAC, for all its bureaucratic ups and downs, has proven
surprisingly resilient. In 1996, after Dr. Varmus -- at the urging of
biotech companies, researchers, AIDS activists and some other patients'
advocates -- proposed abolishing the committee, supporters rallied. They
argued that the panel fostered important public debate. In response, the
NIH director dropped efforts to eliminate the panel, but restricted its
reviews to the most novel or controversial experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today, Dr. Varmus says curbing the RAC's role was the right move,
though he is open to examining the issue further. "We may have made some
misjudgments," he says. "But I'm not convinced of that yet."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Others say it is time to give the committee more muscle. "There is a
need for more active and more transparent oversight of the field than it
has had since the RAC powers were reduced," says Georgetown's Mr.
Walters.

Office Seeks to Increase Disclosure
Of Adverse Reactions to Gene Therapy
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Chris Adams
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>453 words</div><div>1 November 1999</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- A National Institutes of Health office proposes
increasing public disclosure of adverse reactions to gene-therapy
research, against the wishes of some companies that want to keep the
data confidential.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After some companies requested that certain patient safety data be
kept confidential, the NIH's Office of Recombinant DNA Activities set
out to draft rules that could expressly require that such information
not be confidential. While the rules would allow certain proprietary
information to remain secret, they wouldn't allow information on patient
deaths or other adverse reactions to be shielded from public view. The
proposed rules are expected to be discussed at a meeting next month,
after which they could be finalized and made part of the NIH's official
gene-therapy-research guidelines.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Office of Recombinant DNA Activities reviews the ethically
sensitive and scientifically challenging research involving gene
therapy, which seeks to treat diseases by replacing or altering the
body's own defective cells. The unit was founded, in part, to allay the
public's concerns about gene therapy. Under the proposed rules,
information from gene-therapy experiments could become public after
being submitted to the NIH committee -- even if the same information,
when shared with other agencies, would remain secret.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The gene therapy community in general has been a fairly open one,"
said Philip Noguchi, a gene-therapy expert with the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. As an example, the recent death of a patient in a
gene-therapy experiment was quickly reported by University of
Pennsylvania researchers in charge of the study.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In recent months, however, Schering-Plough Corp., of Madison, N.J.,
has requested that some patient data from its gene-therapy trials be
kept confidential, as they would be by the FDA. "We believe that some of
this information is proprietary competitive information," the company
said in a statement.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The NIH "would still get everything," company spokesman Robert
Consalvo said. "It's a matter of what would be available to the public."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Ronald G. Crystal, of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center,
said the public "clearly has to be protected . . . but the [NIH
committee] clearly is not set up to evaluate safety issues. They don't
have the manpower to do that."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
More than a year ago, Dr. Crystal requested the death of a patient in
one of his gene-therapy trials be keep confidential when he first
alerted the NIH about it. The death was not linked to the gene-therapy
experiment itself, and it was subsequently widely reported in scientific
meetings and medical journals, Dr. Crystal said.

Letters to the Editor:
Hidden Dangers of Gene Therapy
</b>
</div><div>703 words</div><div>27 September 1999</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>A35</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In his Sept. 8 editorial-page commentary "Better Genes for Better
Living," Henry I. Miller presents a splendid discussion of gene therapy
and genetic enhancement as the next phase in medicine. I would like to
add some key points he missed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Miller argues that gene therapy is just part of the vast
continuum of medicine. This is only partially true. There are actually
two radically different kinds of gene therapy: germline and somatic gene
therapy. In the former, alterations are made in the genetic material of
a fertilized egg or early embryo, and the organism produced has the
altered genetic material in every cell. Somatic gene therapy is done on
children or adults rather than on eggs. Only the specific tissue
affected by a disease, such as sickle cell anemia, receives the
corrected genetic information. The alteration can be very effective in
treating the disease in the individual, but it is not passed on to the
next generation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Germline gene therapy in humans is currently against the
recommendations of the prominent scientific and medical societies, and
with good reason. First, it is difficult to "target" a correction
successfully, resulting in the likely production of many abortive or
defective embryos as we try to achieve germline gene correction.
Secondly, many conditions, such as sickle cell anemia, seem like
diseases to us now, but may have been useful to humans in the
evolutionary past, and may be useful in the future. The corrections we
make in the germline will affect all future generations, and may have
unanticipated effects. We know, for instance, that sickle cell anemia
affords protection against malaria, and we suspect that many other
genetic conditions may protect against diseases such as bubonic plague
and cholera. Finally, we don't yet have complete control over the genes
we insert into cells, and the risk is simply too great that a corrected
gene for sickle cell anemia will wreak havoc somewhere else.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Miller's article moves right on to the immense possibilities not
just of gene "therapy," but of genetic enhancement as well. We recently
saw genetically engineered mice that were smarter than normal mice, and
we even saw the production of mice with an improved, more loving
disposition. No doubt we'd enjoy the possibility of making these types
of improvements in humans. But the matter of genetic enhancement is
quite different medically from that of gene therapy. In genetic
enhancement, we are tampering with a completely functional genome,
adding something to make it better. The risks of disrupting something
else in the process are significant, and we could be destroying a
perfectly good life in our attempt to make it "better."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some of the problems of germline gene therapy are magnified even
further in genetic enhancement attempts. While we're pretty sure that
the sickle cell anemia gene affects only the blood-forming tissues, we
know far less of the many genes that may be involved in candidate genes
for genetic enhancement. For instance, stature and personality are
affected by large numbers of genes, each of which plays a number of
different roles in the organism. We may think we're just increasing an
individual's height, but we may unexpectedly create all sorts of
physical or mental abnormalities. It's probably not worth the risk.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lastly, genetic enhancement assumes we can achieve improvement by
changing the DNA. But the traits we value most are influenced not only
by genes, but also by environment. Laboratory mice all live in a very
similar environment -- a cage in a university laboratory. Humans live in
different environments, and this in large measure accounts for the
differences between us. We can neither blame the genes for most of our
ills, nor expect to correct all of our shortcomings merely by
manipulating the DNA.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Continued research in genetics is essential to our future. Somatic
gene therapy for bona fide genetic diseases should be pursued with
vigor. But we have far more work to do, in science, society and
medicine, before we should even think about genetic enhancement or
tampering with the germline.

Gene Therapy:
Remember when biotech was going to make entrepreneurs
very, very rich? It has been quite a ride since then
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Rodney Ho
</div><div>3364 words</div><div>24 May 1999</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>R8</div><div>English</div><div>(Copyright (c) 1999, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.)</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
South San Francisco, Calif. -- In the 1990s, investors celebrated the
potential of a hot, young industry set to change the world.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
No, we're not talking about the Internet.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The euphoria was over biotechnology, the industry that seeks to
develop commercial drugs through breakthroughs in microbiology. In 1991,
the height of the biotech boom, investors flung more than $2.5 billion
at companies with names such as Biomatrix and ImClone. That year, Ernst
& Young predicted that total biotech revenue would swell to $75 billion
by the year 2000 from about $4 billion in 1991.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But in 1992 the party ended abruptly. Early that year, the Food and
Drug Administration rejected several promising drugs, including Centocor
Inc.'s Centoxin, a medicine meant to fight a deadly bacteria infection
common in surgery patients. Investors were stunned. It became clear that
biotech companies had oversold their abilities to come up with new drugs
targeted to specific problems and shorten the time it takes to develop
the medications. Speculative investors, who had run up the stocks, fled.
After quadrupling in value from Jan. 31, 1990, to Jan. 31, 1992, the
Hambrecht & Quist Biotech 100 Index sank 43% by September 1992.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The industry didn't wither away, however. Though far fewer
blockbuster drugs have made it into the market than anticipated, a
number of biotech companies have held on. Their tales illustrate the
difficulties the industry has faced in persuading investors that seeking
the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow -- a profitable drug that
saves lives -- takes time and patience.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cor Therapeutics Inc. of South San Francisco is one of 36 biotech
companies that went public during the frenzied year of 1991. Formed in
1988, Cor would have to wait another decade before it would find out
whether its anticlotting drug, Integrilin, had FDA clearance to go to
market. In that time, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. sold more than $600 billion
of products, Garth Brooks fans scooped up more than 80 million of his
records and the World Wide Web made the biotech craze seem like a
hiccup.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cor's origins go back to 1987, when venture capitalist Lee Douglas
trolled the labs at the University of California in San Francisco
looking for hot biomedical ideas to invest in. There he found Rusty
Williams and Shawn Coughlin, two academics who were pondering the
commercial and therapeutic potential of receptors. These are substances
on cell surfaces that act as docking areas for certain molecules to pass
along biochemical messages. Dr. Coughlin thought that the large
pharmaceutical companies weren't paying enough attention to certain
targets to treat the No. 1 killer, heart disease, and that studies of
specific receptors could bring about useful treatments. Mr. Douglas
agreed and formed Cor with four others, including Dr. Coughlin and Dr.
Williams.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One of Cor's many ideas quickly came to the forefront: a drug that
prevents platelets from sticking to each other and clogging blood
vessels, based on 17 years of research by a UC-SF professor and company
co-founder, David Phillips. This drug benefits people that have had
their arteries cleared of plaque in some way, such as angioplasty. After
the plaque is swept away, the artery walls are often damaged, causing
thrombosis, a condition in which platelets aggregate around the damage.
This could quickly cause a fatal new blockage. Cor's drug would block
the receptors that bring platelets together and prevent thrombosis after
coronary surgery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To develop the drug, two major venture firms gave Cor $2 million --
"chicken feed," in the view of Dr. Phillips, but enough for fellow
scientist Robert Scarborough to test various snake venoms for the
appropriate peptide that would block the clotting receptors. By late
1989, Dr. Scarborough perfected a copy of the venom peptide, which Cor
would call Integrilin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By that time, Cor already had competitors developing anticlotting
drugs. Centocor of Malvern, Pa., was in clinical trials with ReoPro,
which uses a different concept to achieve a similar nonclotting result.
Pharmaceutical giant Merck & Co. was developing its Aggrastat.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It was frantic.... I knew Merck had 20 chemists on it," Dr.
Scarborough says. "We had three." In this race, he adds, "I wouldn't
have bet on us if I were on the outside."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cor managed to keep pace, and by the spring of 1991, as it prepared
to start human clinical trials of Integrilin, the company went public.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The odds against the company were long: Just one in 10 drugs that
reach this stage gets to market. And then there was the fact that by
1991, the FDA had cleared fewer than 30 biotech-related drugs since the
first one was approved in 1982. Moreover, the market for initial public
offerings had stumbled, and Cor's original intention to sell more than
$30 million of stock at $12 a share quickly became unrealistic.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Vaughn Kailian, a former Marion Merrell Dow Inc. executive hired the
year before to be chief executive and help take the company public,
found the deteriorating market conditions frustrating. The day Mr.
Kailian had to decide on a price target for the company's first share
offering, he was holed up in a Sheraton hotel room in Stockholm winding
down from a long road show. He spent the day on his bed talking with
bankers 6,000 miles away in San Francisco. Hungry and tired, he sighed
and committed to an initial offering price of $7.50 a share and just two
million shares. "That would last us 12 months, tops," he says. "That
wasn't going to be enough."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In fact, he told investors, "We'll be back." And as luck would have
it, the market stormed back over the summer, enabling Cor to sell 2.3
million more shares in the early fall at $18.25 each.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
That kept Cor alive for two more years while it went through clinical
trials led by the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. Cor was
nothing if not opportunistic, aware the money spigots opened and closed
in a heartbeat. When the market revived again in 1993, Cor went back
twice that year for cash totaling more than $85 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
By 1995, the race had its first winner. Centocor got ReoPro on the
market in February. Merck was slightly behind Cor in clinical trials. In
June, Cor finished its first full-blown study of 4,000 angioplasty
patients. The test, which the company called Impact II, cost Cor $20
million, but it was crucial to receiving FDA approval.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Two days before Mr. Kailian was due to make a major speech at a
Goldman, Sachs & Co. investment conference, he received the Impact II
results at Duke: positive, but just barely. The study found the drug had
helped people, but not to a massive degree. This was bad news. He
brooded all the way back to San Francisco because he sensed this
wouldn't satisfy the FDA.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The federal agency wasn't the only one the company wasn't going to
satisfy. The news of the mediocre test results disappointed investors,
who sent Cor's stock price tumbling. It quickly dropped in half to as
low as $9. At the investment conference, Mr. Kailian hit the speaker's
dais at midmorning and decided to ditch his entire slide presentation
shortly after it began. He ordered the lights back on, read the top of a
press release about the study's disheartening results, and took
questions from the crowd for 35 minutes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He tried to mollify analysts, saying he was sure the drug worked --
Cor just needed to figure out why the results weren't better. His words
helped coax the stock up slightly to $10.25 that day, but investors
remained lukewarm for months. Cor later discovered it hadn't given
patients enough of the drug to make it as effective as it could be.
Nonetheless, the FDA wanted to study the results and convened a special
advisory committee of doctors. To nobody's surprise, the committee
concluded Integrilin needed more study.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
So Cor's fate rested on an even bigger study, which the company
called Pursuit. This study used a higher dosage of the drug on a wider
variety of patients -- including those with unstable angina, severe
chest pains that often lead to heart attacks. The study, which wound up
using 11,000 patients in 27 countries, was far too expensive for Cor to
go it alone. So the little company hooked up with a major pharmaceutical
corporation. Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J., agreed to split
North American rights to Integrilin and receive more extensive marketing
rights outside the U.S. In return, Schering-Plough would pay  most of
the cost of Pursuit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Even with a deep-pocketed partner, Cor was running low on money by
the fall of 1996. The company began pondering whether to raise more
capital in a weak position or tough it out until Pursuit results were
out the next year. The company's top brass was uncertain. Mr. Kailian,
in what he says was the most difficult decision of his tenure, decided
Cor should wait.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In mid-1997, the Pursuit results showed that patients with violent
chest pains who took Integrilin were 10% less likely to die or have a
heart attack than those who hadn't, a statistically significant
difference in the world of biotech. If used widely, Integrilin could
save thousands of lives a year. Cor thought Pursuit would give
Integrilin enough credibility to receive FDA approval.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hoping to get in the market as quickly as possible, Cor sidetracked
other projects and had employees frantically compile all the necessary
papers to file to the FDA by Oct. 1, 1997. That would make sure
Integrilin would get on the FDA advisory committee's docket in January.
Merck had already filed for Aggrastat. "This was life or death," Mr.
Kailian says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Jan. 28, 1998, the FDA gathered the special advisory committee of
doctors again to review the new data. Though the advisory committee's
recommendations are nonbinding, the FDA gives them special
consideration. Packed before hundreds of analysts and competitors,
scientists from Cor and Duke University parried with the panel over both
studies. It didn't go smoothly.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The panel was missing its principal medical reviewer, Robert Temple,
who was, coincidentally, getting an angioplasty. "The committee was
getting hung up on data missing from 12 patients," says Mike King, a
BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst who follows the biotechnology
industry and was at the meeting. "It was surreal, Kafkaesque."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Kailian likens it to "watching sausage being made. And we were
the sausage."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the end of the day, the panel gave Cor less than half a loaf: It
approved the drug for use with angioplasty patients, but not for the
bigger market in unstable angina. This would severely limit the drug's
overall potential. The stock price was cut in half to $9.4375.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I was shocked," Mr. Kailian says. He got the Cor group together and
told them to buck up over the next 60 days to provide a rebuttal for the
FDA. A flurry of faxes ensued as the FDA pored over the data.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
April 1 arrived, deadline day for a final response from the FDA.
Ellen Martin, Cor's regulatory affairs vice president, ate lunch at her
desk, within earshot of the relevant fax machine. At 2:48 p.m. Pacific
time, she heard the whir of the first page come over. But the first 17
pages of mostly boilerplate material didn't tell her what Cor wanted to
know: Did the company have FDA permission to use Integrilin for the
broadest range of patients with acute coronary disease?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After four agonizing minutes, which Mr. Kailian likened to "watching
Astroturf grow," page 18 came out. The answer was yes. The FDA had
overturned its own advisory committee's recommendation. Ms. Martin
handed the relevant page to her boss, who gave her a bearhug, lifting
her off the ground. Ms. Martin, who had been at Cor for several years,
simply felt battle-weary relief.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A real celebration couldn't happen yet. As a public company, Cor
couldn't release this crucial information companywide until it did so
publicly. Because the market was already closed, Cor officials decided
to wait until the morning. So only a handful at Cor knew that day what
had happened. Many other employees gathered in the parking lot the next
morning to learn the news. Cor had its press release on the newswires by
4 a.m. Pacific time and taped to all major doors at the office.
Early-morning commuters would have seen Cor employees dancing in the
parking lot as the early-spring sun rose.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the euphoria, even conservative Cor officials got ahead of
themselves, predicting Integrilin sales of $20 million to $40 million in
its first five months. Actual Integrilin sales in that time span totaled
just $12 million. Centocor, with a four-year head start, remained the
market leader. And Merck ended up beating Cor to the punch by two months
with its Aggrastat product. Cor's stock price remained stuck in the
doldrums, staying mostly in the $7 to $15 range through early spring of
this year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonetheless, 11 years and more than $160 million later, Cor can
proudly say it's no longer just a research-and-development company. It
now has nearly 100 salespeople pounding hospital hallways for new
business.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cor headquarters was a bustling place one recent Friday. A dozen
cardiologists flown in from around the country were visiting the
facility to learn more about Integrilin. Staff members were putting the
finishing touches on the 1998 annual report. Tech people were grappling
with the notorious Melissa virus, which clogged the company's e-mail
system. Mark Perrin, operations head, had just returned from a national
sales meeting and was cheered by accelerating sales, with projected
revenue of $60 million by year's end. Dr. Scarborough, vice president of
medicinal chemistry, toiled away on patent applications for an oral
version of Integrilin, a way to help Cor become a multiproduct company.
He already has 30 patents to his name. ("I feel like a patent attorney
at times," he jokes.)
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Kailian, an easy-going 54-year-old married man with two adult
children, typically works in blue jeans and sweaters, though he's
dressed formally this day for the cardiologists' benefit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I only wear suits and ties for people who can write a check to the
company," he says with a grin. His office is scattered with family
pictures and wry mementos, such as a piece of driftwood so he can "knock
on wood" whenever he says something positive. "I've actually broken it
into two," he says. And there's a gift a friend gave him: a tin cup, to
represent the begging he's had to do over the years for money. "You just
don't know when the last dollar you raised is truly the last dollar," he
says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Cor took advantage of a friendly marketplace earlier in the decade to
get as far as it has. And most other companies -- 25 of 36 -- in Cor's
class of 1991 survived. Several have FDA-approved products on the
market. Four -- Icos Corp., IDEC Pharmaceuticals Corp., MedImmune Inc.
and Sepracor Inc. -- have market capitalizations of more than $1
billion, a threshold that helps attract large investors. "If you bought
the entire class of 1991 that year, you'd have a decent return today,"
says James McCamant, editor of Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley, Calif.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But traders today are either going blue chip or chasing the hottest
Internet stock, leaving smaller, cash-strapped biotech companies in the
dust. There have been virtually no biotech IPOs in recent months.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Still, as the biotech industry matures, there are positive signs on
the horizon. The FDA has cut down the time it takes to get drugs through
the pipeline, and approved a record number of biotech drugs last year.
And Ernst & Young says the next decade promises a bigger crop, with more
than 300 biotech products in clinical trials for AIDS, cancer,
Alzheimer's and other diseases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the meantime, Mr. Kailian is planning another challenge: skydiving
with his son, Michael, a member of the elite U.S. Army Golden Knights
parachuting team. "It should be easy," Mr. Kailian says. "I've been
flying without a chute for years."

Race Is On in Gene Therapies for Heart Disease

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
DALLAS -- Floyd Stokes was so hobbled by the severe chest pain called
angina that he couldn't walk more than 100 yards and had to manage his
1,800-acre peanut farm from his pickup truck.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Then, in May, researchers at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston
injected his heart with an experimental gene that promotes blood-vessel
growth. Three weeks later, his pain was gone. "I can work as hard as I
want and walk anywhere I want to," Mr. Stokes said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The 58-year-old DeLeon, Texas, man is one reason several
international research teams are locked in a hot race to develop genetic
treatments for cardiovascular disease, the leading killer in the
developed world. The researchers are experimenting with a variety of
competing techniques, using genes and proteins, to induce the heart to
grow its own vessels to circumvent blockages that cause chest pain and
heart attacks, and to restore life-sustaining blood to the heart.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists caution that this research is in very early stages. Only a
small number of patients have been treated, and not everyone has been
helped. Rigorous scientific trials that are needed to prove such
treatments work are just getting under way.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But in several studies being delivered this week at the American
Heart Association's annual Scientific Sessions here, researchers are
reporting that the approach appears to be safe and, as Mr. Stokes's case
suggests, that there are indications the treatment holds promise.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We are encouraged by the safety and apparent efficacy" of the idea,
said Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's and the Tufts University School of
Medicine and the leader of the group that treated Mr. Stokes.
"Generally, there is a recognition that (this) constitutes a new form of
therapy for cardiovascular disease."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some enthusiasts believe that eventually the techniques could replace
coronary-bypass surgery for many patients. But initially the researchers
are focusing on about 100,000 patients a year with so-called peripheral
vascular disease, or blockages most commonly found in the legs, who
might be candidates. They are also focusing on what Stephen Ellis, a
cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, estimates could be as many as
250,000 patients a year who, for various reasons, aren't good candidates
for bypass surgery or balloon angioplasty. With such market potential,
most of the research groups are already connected with companies seeking
to commercialize the technology.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Isner's group, for instance, is working with Human Genome
Sciences Inc., Rockville, Md., and is testing direct, or naked, DNA that
produces a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF.
The material is injected into the heart through a small incision in the
chest. Among 16 heart patients treated and analyzed so far, all have
reported sharply reduced chest pain. Among 11 followed for at least
three months, six, including Mr. Stokes, are free of chest pain, Dr.
Isner said. Use of nitroglycerin tablets to treat chest-pain symptoms
declined to an average of 2.5 pills a week for each member of the group,
from 60 before treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A group headed by Ronald G. Crystal, a researcher at New York Cornell
Medical Center, New York, reported promising results among 21 patients
treated with a VEGF gene that was transferred to heart muscle with a
so-called adenovirus that delivers genetic instructions to the nucleus
of cells. The work is supported by GenVec Inc., Rockville, Md., and
Warner Lambert Co., Morris Plains, N.J.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Crystal said it is too early to characterize the clinical benefit
but said there weren't any adverse effects reported and that "all the
trends are going in the right direction."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Collateral Therapeutics Inc., San Diego, is launching a 100-patient
trial to test whether another substance, fibroblast growth factor, will
induce growth of vessels and improve blood flow in the heart.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meanwhile, a group at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's
Hospital, Boston, is seeking to improve results of bypass surgery in
peripheral vascular patients by immersing replacement vessels in a
genetic bath before the procedure. Michael Mann, a leader of the team,
said that in a small, randomized trial involving 33 patients, those
given the treatment had a lower failure rate and were less likely to
need a second procedure after an average of seven months than those who
didn't get the treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers from the Univeristy of Kuopio, Finland, and the Medical
College of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, also reported favorable results in
early experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Over the next year or two, we will see data emerging that will prove
or disprove whether this therapy is effective," said Dr. Crystal.

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is the second in a Daily News series on New York's leading medical researchers the scientists who are working on the cures of tomorrow. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You can talk about prevention of disease by genetic screening until your face turns blue," says Dr. Savio Woo, who specializes in the molecules of human genes. "The problem is, what do you do with patients who manifest disease at this moment?" </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woo thinks genes can do more than tell people whether they are at high risk for disease. He thinks that one day, a full understanding of the most basic cell mechanisms will cure many common illnesses from cancer and diabetes to heart disease. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His therapy for colon cancer that migrates to the liver is in preliminary trials on humans done to make sure that a technique is safe before doctors test to see if it works. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woo starts with viruses infectious organisms that are adept at invading human cells. "Viruses have co-evolved with us," he says. "Transferring their genetic material into our cells is how they survive. They do it very efficiently." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woo uses different viruses, including one that triggers the common cold. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">First, he and his 12-person lab team strip viruses of harmful elements. Then they load them with better genes material from healthy genes available to researchers as a result of earlier studies. Finally, the team injects them as "vectors" what Woo calls "transfer vehicles" that ferry the improved genes into the cells. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If they perfect the technique, they will be able to use it "to treat a whole bunch of genetic diseases," Woo says. He works with mice, rats even a group of hemophiliac dogs in North Carolina to test basic approaches to cancer, diabetes and hemophilia. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the dog study, Woo has put a gene that encodes a blood clotting factor into the livers of hemophiliac canines. As a result, the dogs are "making a sufficient level of clotting factor, which has partially corrected {their disease} for over four years," Woo says. Though one animal's treatment has been especially successful, the dog is notably ungrateful "The dog doesn't like me," the genial scientist says, with a laugh. But the animal "is looking very smart, very good." Woo's next step is to make the treatment last longer. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With diabetes, Woo is doing something different. "If patients have diabetes because they lack the ability to produce insulin from the pancreas, why not deliver the insulin gene to other organs, to help the patient produce insulin?" he says. Because too much insulin can be deadly, "We need to produce a way to regulate it, too." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy for cancer is more complicated, Woo says, because there are so many kinds of the disease. His innovative approach works well in animals that have cancer of the colon, breast, brain and ovary: He delivers toxin genes that make tumor cells sensitive to usually ineffective drugs. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The {genes} don't hurt the healthy tissues, and they kill the bad ones a different way of doing chemotherapy," Woo says. "We ask the cells politely to commit suicide." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though the method buys time for patients, the cancers recur. And "the suicide gene is not very effective with metastasis," Woo says. "So the idea is, why not deliver, along with the suicide gene, some genes that will take the immune system into action?" </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When the initial trial is complete on the suicide gene, "We want to do Phase 1 studies on the combination approach hopefully, later this year." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The possibilities seem endless. "Can we deliver a gene or two to correct or alleviate symptoms?" the scientist wonders. "Let's say a patient has heart disease can we deliver a gene to a patient, so we can help the patient get rid of {high} blood cholesterol? Why not?" </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Dr. Michael Blaese, at the Human Genome Research Project in Bethesda, Md., Woo strives to "apply fundamental science" to the treatment of various human diseases. "What they are doing is very hard, and it is also very early in the process of trying to use the tools that genetic engineering has given us. It is sort of like Christmas morning, and you tear the paper off the package and there is this wonderful shiny thing and you don't know what to do, but it sure looks great." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Woo was born in China but studied medicine in the United States. He spent 20 years at Houston's Baylor University before coming to Mount Sinai in 1996. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In his free time, Woo enjoys museums and the city's cultural opportunities. But he spends hours trying to secure financing for his research. Most of the money, including his salary, comes from the National Institutes of Health. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Woo, research is a process. In 1983, he cloned the human genome for PKU, a genetic disorder that leads to retardation. Today he has developed PKU mice, "and we have been delivering the normal gene into the livers of these mice, and we can correct the PKU {problem}," Woo says. "But we need a more efficient vector because it works only temporarily." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So now, in addition to everything else, he is working on ways to make better vectors. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SIDEBAR: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">THE HUMAN NUMBERS </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 16 million Americans have Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes, 5.4 million of whom don't know it, according to the Joslin Diabetes Center; 5% to 10% have Type 1 diabetes, formerly known as early onset or juvenile diabetes. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">564,800 people will die of some form of cancer in 1998, says the American Cancer Society; it is the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">16,959 Americans have a form of hemophilia, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE WOODLANDS, Texas -- Genemedicine Inc. said it received four U.S.
patents covering various aspects of gene therapy, including three
through an exclusive license it holds with Baylor College of Medicine in
Houston.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy uses the delivery of genetic material to targeted cells
in the body to produce either immune responses or proteins that can have
a therapeutic effect.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patents cover: a manufacturing technology that Genemedicine said
eliminates the need to use antibiotics in producing nonviral
gene-therapy products; a method of delivering genetic material to the
eye; a method for restricting the expression of the proteins or immune
responses to specific tissues within the body; and the rights to a gene,
encoding a receptor for very low-density lipoproteins, that is expected
to offer a way of treating high-cholesterol levels and possibly certain
cardiovascular diseases, using gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Genemedicine said the method for restricting gene expression and
enhancing its effect on specific tissues could undergo active clinical
trials within two years; the commercial application of uses covered by
the other patents remains further off.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">DOCTORS WERE IN THE HOUSE, THE HALL, the hotel and on every street corner in Orlando, Fla., as 37,000 of them mostly cardiologists attended the American Heart Association's 70th Scientific Sessions last week. The doctors spent much of their time examining 4,298 research papers. Among their findings: </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy can aid patients with atherosclerosis, the condition where arteries thicken usually because of fat deposits. In an experimental procedure at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston, doctors injected growth DNA into the legs of patients with blocked circulation. The genes triggered new blood vessels in 70% of the treatments, and patients reported significantly less pain. The approach may one day be used along with standard procedures like coronary bypass surgery, and will probably help the estimated 100,000 to 200,000 Americans with severe leg blockage avoid possible amputation. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A diet rich in fish is better than one that sticks to vegetables only, heart researchers in Seattle found. Eating lots of fish lowers lipoprotein (a), a blood fat that increases the risk of heart attack. Scientists drew some of their data from studies of two Bantu tribes of East Africa, one living by a lake and eating fish, the other settled in farmland and vegetarian. The lake-dwelling Bantu diet is 23% fish protein, balanced by 70% carbohydrates and 7% fat. The vegetarian Bantu diet is 11% protein from maize and rice, 82% carbohydrate, and 7% fat. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">High blood pressure can make orgasm more difficult for women. Male sexuality and hypertension have long been studied, with problems linked to drugs used to combat hypertension. But a new study of women's sexual experience found that those with hypertension were less likely to achieve orgasm, less likely to have adequate vaginal lubrication. Researchers at the Mary Imogene Bassett Research Institute in upstate Cooperstown studied 211 pre-menopausal Caucasian women, tabulating their feelings about sexual quality, desire, arousal, frequency and satisfaction. High blood pressure is a reading of 140/90 or more; it afflicts 45% of women ages 55 to 64, 60% ages 65 to 74 and 75% of those over 75. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">FOR A FEW HOURS ON THURSDAY, TIMES Square will become the "Commit to Quit" Cafe for the 22d annual Great American Smoke-Out featuring actress Debi Mazar, 33, who will attend what the American Cancer Society is hyping as the first-ever "Non-Smoke Break." </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mazur started smoking when she was 12 and has tried, and failed, to quit several times. She's using nicotine replacement therapy which has been shown to double the success rate for quitters, according to the American Cancer Society. </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's good news for the 16 million American smokers who try to kick the habit each year only 1.3 million succeed.

Insider-Trading
Charges Filed
In Sandoz Deal
---
Several Defendants Cited
In Case Involving Offer
For Genetic Therapy

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- The Securities and Exchange Commission filed insider
trading charges against a current and a former official at Ruder-Finn
Inc. involving the New York public-relations company and Sandoz Ltd.'s
tender offer for Genetic Therapy Inc.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ruder-Finn represented Sandoz, the Swiss pharmaceutical giant, in the
acquisition.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a suit filed in New York federal court, the SEC said Susan
Smirnoff, a Ruder-Finn senior vice president, passed inside information
about the Sandoz acquisition to her husband, Kirk J. Zachary, who made
$5,527 by trading on Genetic Therapy call-option contracts. Ms. Smirnoff
and Mr. Zachary were accused of insider trading.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a separate suit, filed in federal court in Savannah, Ga., Susan
Hirsch, a former Ruder-Finn senior account representative, was accused
of improperly passing information about the tender offer to her brother
Gregory Hirsch, a Savannah certified public accountant. The SEC alleged
that Mr. Hirsch purchased Genetic Therapy common stock and options
jointly with a friend in Savannah, Danny Kaminsky, before the tender
offer was announced in July 1995. Messrs. Hirsch and Kaminsky, who the
SEC said made a profit of more than $250,000, also were accused of
insider trading.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ms. Smirnoff and Mr. Zachary agreed to settle the lawsuit without
admitting or denying the allegations, an SEC attorney said. They will
forfeit the $5,527 in trading profit plus another $728 in interest, and
Mr. Zachary will pay an additional fine of $5,527. They also agreed to
permanent injunctions barring them from violating securities laws in the
future. Neither defendant could be reached for comment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Savannah suit seeks essentially the same result as the New York
settlement: disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and injunctions
against future violations. But Bruce Baird, an attorney representing
Gregory Hirsch, noted that the SEC's complaint rested on an SEC
enforcement tool known as the "misappropriation theory." The validity of
that theory is scheduled to be argued in a case before the Supreme Court
next month. Mr. Baird said his client "plans first of all to see what
the Supreme Court has to say." Other defendants couldn't be reached.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ruder-Finn said Ms. Smirnoff had been suspended pending a meeting of
the firm's executive committee to discuss the matter and that Susan
Hirsch had left the company more than a year ago. Ruder-Finn Chairman
David Finn said the company "deplored" and "was upset about" the alleged
behavior.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bernard Bressler, an attorney representing Ruder-Finn, stressed that
the public-relations firm wasn't accused of wrongdoing in either of the
two cases and that the company was cooperating with the SEC. "The
information was misappropriated from us," he said.

France Pursues Global Leadership in Gene Therapy

Government, Rhone-Poulenc Seek Payoff
From Genetic-Research Triumphs
</b>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
PARIS -- From the days of Louis Pasteur to the identification of the
AIDS virus a few years ago, French medical researchers have earned
respect and a fair number of Nobel Prizes. But the brainpower rarely has
brought commercial success.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now, the French government and a major French drug maker are trying
to turn this country's widely acclaimed achievements in genetic research
into global leadership in gene therapy, a potentially lucrative but
still experimental effort to use genes to treat cancers, heart disease,
AIDS and inherited ills. The government is urging academic scientists
and private industry to set aside differences and forge strong research
alliances.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among the initial liaisons, Genopoietic SA, a fledgling biotechnology
company, in partnership with pharmaceutical giant Rhone-Poulenc Rorer
Inc., recently launched France's first clinical trial of a gene therapy,
targeting severe brain cancers and a skin cancer called melanoma.
Rhone-Poulenc officials predict that at least three more gene-therapy
trials will be introduced within a year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Officials at France's national health service are finalizing plans
for a national network of gene-therapy centers to be built over the next
few years. And the government says it may spend one billion French
francs (currently $206 million) to foster start-up companies and boost
gene-discovery efforts until the year 2000.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
France's decision to go for gold in the global biotech race is a
welcome change, some scientists here say. "We have plenty of ideas, but
we aren't very good at developing products from them," says David
Klatzmann, a founder of Genopoietic and professor at Paris hospital
Pitie-Salpetriere. Success could encourage U.S.-style scientific
entrepreneurs, a rarity in France as many geneticists prefer the
security of academic posts.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But gene therapy is still mostly a dream. About 500 patients have
been treated in roughly 100 trials approved by regulators so far, mainly
in the U.S. "Nobody has yet proved conclusively in the clinic that gene
therapy works," acknowledges Jean-Francois Mayaux, a senior
Rhone-Poulenc researcher.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhone-Poulenc is betting, however, that gene therapy will live up to
its advance billing. The company "missed the boat" during the initial
phase of the biotechnology revolution, says Manfred Karobath, the firm's
research director, "so we were looking for a new technology that was
still around the corner, but at the same time something that major
competitors hadn't jumped on yet."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company is heartened by recent French advances. In a
technological tour de force 18 months ago, the nonprofit French research
institute, Genethon, produced the first comprehensive human-genome maps.
The maps divide the huge DNA molecule into smaller, more easily handled
molecular landmarks that researchers can use to find their way around
the gigantic and largely unchartered terrain in which all 100,000 or so
human genes reside. Those maps have become indispensable tools for gene
hunters around the world.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now the race is shifting into the potentially more profitable field
of gene therapy. Genopoietic's anti-cancer therapy infiltrates tumor
cells with a "suicide" gene that, once inside a tumor, makes it
vulnerable to a well-known antiviral drug, ganciclovir. The company
hopes to complete a small safety test in a dozen patients by year end,
and, if positive, seek regulatory approval to test it on several hundred
more patients. The company says research groups in the U.K. and U.S.
also are interested in testing the therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhone-Poulenc initially had turned to the U.S. to buy its way into
the gene-therapy business, shelling out $115 million in late 1993 for a
37% stake in Santa Clara, Calif.-based Applied Immune Sciences Inc.
Other U.S. scientists and biotechnology firms were then recruited for a
trans-Atlantic research network called RPR Gencell, unveiled late last
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But initial development of the company's gene-therapy products will
be concentrated in France. Rhone-Poulenc is building a 50-million-franc
pilot factory for small-scale production of gene-therapy products during
clinical trials. And the Gencell network has a strong Gallic tilt,
boasting prominent French members from the Institut Gustave Roussy, one
of the world's leading cancer centers, to the Institut Pasteur. France,
says Rhone-Poulenc's Dr. Karobath, "had a reservoir of avant garde
technology which was above that of many other countries. And as the No.
1 pharmaceutical company in France, we are well-positioned to harness
that base on an almost exclusive basis."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
France has other advantages as well. Tinkering with DNA has sparked a
popular outcry and regulatory constraints in some European countries,
such as Germany and Switzerland. But French public opinion is staunchly
behind gene research, largely the result of aggressive lobbying by
France's influential Muscular Dystrophy Association, which was a
co-founder of Genethon and helps fund the institute with money from the
estimated $60 million it raises each year in a nationwide telethon.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But gene therapy is much more expensive than gene mapping because of
the massive cost of clinical trials. Financial strains are forcing the
association to reconsider its aversion to industry-propelling Genethon
into the Gencell network.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Yet even with its world-class gene hunters and an apparent head
start, Rhone-Poulenc can't match the financial firepower of bigger
rivals moving into gene therapy. So the French government is pitching in
with its proposed gene-therapy centers and its research funding.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
There are signs the Gencell link is encouraging interest in patenting
among French labs. "France -- and Europe in general -- have lost a lot
because we didn't have the patenting culture that has always existed in
the U.S." says Jacques Mallet, head of a lab probing the genetic basis
of mental diseases at state research agency CNRS and a Rhone-Poulenc
consultant.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Mallet says when he suggested patenting some discoveries made in
his lab a few years ago, officials at the state agency laughed. But it
was no joke when similar advances patented by U.S. rivals were exploited
as the technology base of some fledgling biotechnology firms.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhone-Poulenc can't afford similar gaffes. After agreeing last year
to set up a joint lab with Michel Perricaudet, a star scientist at
cancer research center Institut Gustave Roussy, the company immediately
dispatched a patent lawyer to review his work. The attorney wound up
staying five months and churning out more than 50 patent applications.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Rhone-Poulenc scientists concede the payoff from gene therapy may be
years off. "Some people are watching for a clear clinical trial result
or other good news, says Dr. Karobath. "But I'd assume that in three to
five years, every major company will have a gene-therapy program."

Genetic Therapy
Wins Patent for Use
Of Gene Treatment

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Genetic Therapy Inc. received rights to a broad
patent covering a wide range of experimental "gene therapy" techniques
being tested against cancer, AIDS and other illnesses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The biotechnology company received an exclusive license for the
patent from the National Institutes of Health. However, it isn't clear
how valuable the patent will be to the small company, because it may be
years before anyone can commercialize the technique, said Brandon Fradd,
an analyst with Montgomery Securities in San Francisco. Still, he said,
the breadth of the patent helped drive up Genetic Therapy's shares,
which rose $1.50 to $10 in Nasdaq trading yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The company said the patent covers all commercial uses of "ex vivo"
gene therapy, in which human cells are removed from a patient, modified
with an implanted gene and then re-introduced to the patient. About 70
of the 100 approved human gene therapy experiments involve ex vivo
techniques; the rest involve in vivo direct insertion of a gene, or
genes, into the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patent was awarded to French Anderson, who helped pioneer gene
therapy while at NIH in the late 1980s. Genetic Therapy was given the
license at no charge for providing crucial funding and other support for
the first human tests of gene therapy that Dr. Anderson conducted in
1990 on two young girls born with a life-threatening immune deficiency.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The patent results from the successful gene treatment, which opened
the way for the testing of a wide range of gene-based therapies. Dr.
Anderson, who is now at the University of Southern California, is
chairman of Genetic Therapy's scientific advisory board.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The patent's importance may mostly be as a scientific and
psychological boost," said Mr. Fradd, the analyst, noting that most
other companies in the field probably will try to commercialize only in
vivo forms of gene therapy not covered by the patent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
James Barrett, president and chief executive at Genetic Therapy, said
he believes the patent is especially valuable because it will encourage
collaborations with other gene therapy investigators and larger drug
makers. The patent also covers the company's gene therapy that is being
tested in patients with breast cancer, AIDS, and Gaucher's disease.

ROCKVILLE, Md. -- Human Genome Sciences Inc.'s vast store of human
genes will be tapped for human gene therapies under an agreement the
company reached with Genetic Therapy Inc., a fledging biotech company
founded by a pioneer in gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
HGS has a technique for rapidly identifying fragments of DNA that are
parts of human genes, usually before the functions of the genes are
known. Earlier this year, it said it had parts or all of more than
45,000 genes in its files, believed to be the world's largest
collection of human genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Genetic Therapy, in Gaithersburg, Md., counts W. French Anderson as
one of its founders. Dr. Anderson, currently at the University of
Southern California, gained fame for developing genetic therapies for
cancer and other disorders while at the National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under the agreement, the two companies will develop gene therapies
using HGS's genes and Dr. Anderson's therapy techniques. The companies
plan to develop gene therapies both on their own and in collaborations
with major drug companies, said William Haseltine, chairman and chief
executive of HGS.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A long-term agreement that HGS has with SmithKline Beecham PLC isn't
affected by the pact with Genetic Therapy since "with some exceptions
the use of our genes for human therapy was excluded" from the
SmithKline Beecham arrangement, Dr. Haseltine said. SmithKline Beecham
has rights to HGS genes that can be used for making pharmaceuticals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On the Nasdaq Stock Market, HGS shares closed at $16.50, up $1, or
6.5%; Genetic Therapy shares closed at $9.75, up 75 cents, or 8.3%.

Medicine:
New Weapon in Gene Therapy May Be
A Switch That Tells Cells When to Fight
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Jerry E. Bishop
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A biologist and a chemist may have found a way to install a
biological "switch" in human cells that could turn genes on and off
as needed. The discovery may open a new way to treat human ills with
gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In existing gene therapy, a patient's cells are removed,
implanted with a gene that tells cells to manufacture a protein that
helps fight or resist disease and then reintroduced to the
bloodstream.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But now researchers are talking about a new era of "regulated
gene therapy," in which one pill switches on a protein-making gene,
and then a second pill turns it off.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It may be possible, for example, for a diabetic to get an
infusion of cells engineered with the gene switch and the insulin
gene. Then, instead of taking several injections of insulin a day,
the patient could take nontoxic pills to switch the insulin gene on
and off as needed. Chemotherapy for cancer may someday be a matter
of taking a pill to switch on poison-making genes in cells that have
been designed to home in on a tumor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Last week, Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc., a fledgling Boston
biotechnology company, announced that it had licensed the
technology.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's the first time anyone has been able to regulate gene
expression," says Ariad President Harvey Berger, who predicts that
the first human experiments using the new technique might begin as
early as next year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The invention -- by chemist Stuart L. Schreiber of Harvard
University and biologist Gerald R. Crabtree of Stanford University
-- has been stirring enthusiasm among biologists, gene therapists
and biotechnology researchers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Michael Blaese, chief of clinical gene therapy research at the
new National Center for Human Genome Research in Bethesda, Md.,
notes that the problem with current gene therapy is that the
implanted gene functions continuously, supplying, for instance, a
child with a missing protein to avert mental retardation. "But many
genes in the body, such as the one for insulin or for various
hormones, work only intermittently," he explains. The new
gene-switch technique "offers gene therapy a really unique set of
tools."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers are even designing a "fail safe" switch that will
cause the genetically engineered cells to self-destruct if they
malfunction, cause unwanted side effects or have simply finished
their job.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The invention hinges on the workings of cell receptors --
specialized proteins on or near the cell's surface. These receptors
are designed to grab hold and react to chemical signals drifting by
in the bloodstream. Each protein receptor reacts to one particular
chemical signal and no other.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When a receptor is tripped by a passing chemical, it launches a
train of signals that reach into the nucleus of the cell where the
genes reside. The signals tell the cell to start reading the
"message" written in a particular gene: instructions to begin making
a certain protein. For instance, a rising concentration of glucose
in the blood trips a receptor that turns on the insulin gene in
certain cells in the pancreas gland.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Drs. Schreiber and Crabtree created a synthetic receptor, derived
from one found in white blood cells, called T-cells, that helps
fight off invasions of foreign tissues. The T-cell receptor consists
of several identical but separate proteins that hang side by side
just below the cell surface.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The receptor lies dormant until some chemical permeates the cell
and links two or more of the proteins together. This linking tells a
gene in the T-cell to begin making proteins that launch an attack
against, say, a transplanted kidney.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
What intrigued the two scientists about this T-cell receptor was
that a molecule of a Japanese drug, FK506, will bind to one of the
receptor's proteins and prevent it from linking up to a neighboring
protein. The drug thus blocks the receptor from turning on its gene,
which explains why it is so effective in preventing the rejection of
transplanted organs.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The two scientists figured out how to use FK506 to activate the
receptor and turn on the gene. They welded molecules of FK506 to
opposite ends of a "linker" molecule to create a kind of
dumbbell-shaped molecule, dubbed FK1012, Dr. Schreiber explains.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When FK1012 seeps into a cell with the receptor, one end will
bind to one receptor protein and the other end to a neighboring
protein, thereby creating the link that activates the receptor and
turns on the gene.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The scientists can package the components needed to make the
receptor into a gene cassette along with a "gene of interest," which
controls the relevant protein production. The cassette can then be
spliced into whole cells such as T-cells. Whenever the researchers
want to turn on the gene of interest they merely add a little
FK1012. To turn it off, they add a modified version of FK506.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The trick, says Dr. Schreiber, has worked in test tubes. "Next,
we'll try to introduce the system in simple organisms like the fruit
fly or a nematode," he says. "A little way down the road we'll put
it into mice."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For their own basic research, Drs. Schreiber and Crabtree say
they intend to insert a particular gene and the switch into mice and
then turn the gene on or off at any stage of a mouse's development,
from embryo to adulthood, to see what the gene does.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For human therapy, Ariad envisions taking a patient's own T-cells
and, in the test tube, inserting the synthetic receptor and a gene
of interest into the cells. The cells are returned to the patient
who takes a pill of FK1012, or some similar drug, whenever he needs
to turn the gene on and a pill of FK506 to turn it off.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The synthetic receptor would also give gene therapists a
fail-safe switch. Nature has programmed all cells to die whenever
their role in life is finished. The researchers hope to install a
second synthetic receptor in the gene cassette. Then, when the cells
have completed their gene therapy or if something should go wrong, a
simple pill could switch on the apoptosis signals and the cells
would commit suicide.

Foreign Gene Is Implanted in Tumors
In Advance for Gene-Therapy Medicine
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Michael Waldholz
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>704 words</div><div>1 December 1993</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>PAGE B8</div><div>English</div><div>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers successfully implanted a foreign gene directly into
tumors of five skin-cancer patients, a noteworthy advance in the
highly experimental field of gene-therapy medicine.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers at University of Michigan Medical Center said the
gene tricked the body's immune system into launching an attack
against the tumors as if they were foreign, transplanted tissue. The
experiments are considered important because they provide the first
evidence that genes injected directly into human cells can take
hold, function and stimulate the immune system without causing
unwanted toxicity.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The experiment wasn't designed to evaluate the technique's
ability to shrink tumors. But the researchers were heartened when
the gene-triggered attack caused a tumor in one patient to
disappear, although there was no measurable shrinkage of the other
tumors. The cancer, a type of melanoma, was in an especially
advanced, lethal form that hadn't responded to conventional therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We view this as very encouraging," said Gary Nabel, the lead
investigator at the Ann Arbor, Mich., facility. Dr. Nabel said that
since the technique is relatively simple and safe, the initial
success clears the way for testing direct gene therapy against an
array of illnesses. The Michigan researchers are developing the
technique with Vical Inc., a San Diego biotechnology company
interested in using it initially against cancer and heart disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, Dr. Nabel said, "It is premature to say this is going to
be an effective treatment for melanoma."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nonetheless, based on the five-patient test, Dr. Nabel and his
colleagues recently received federal approval to test the
gene-injection idea in 24 additional patients in much higher doses
and against cancer of the colon and other cancers.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The preliminary test results, reported in the current issue of
the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, follow three
years of research in which Dr. Nabel and his wife Elizabeth and
their colleagues at Michigan have attempted to develop a simple yet
safe way to deliver therapeutic genes to the site of disease. Most
other efforts at using gene therapy to treat inherited diseases and
other conditions have attempted to deliver genetic material encased
in deactivated viruses. Viruses are useful because they naturally
incorporate their genes into the nucleus of cells they infect.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But "there has long been a concern that using viruses can pose a
risk," says Jeff Leiden, a researcher at the University of Chicago
who is seeking to use direct gene therapy against heart disease.
"The Nabels believed it was possible to inject genes directly into
human cells, and this new report shows they were right."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the experiment, the researchers sought to make the melanoma
tumors appear as foreign tissue to the immune system. They used a
gene that produces a protein that, like an I.D. badge, sits on the
surface of cells and signals the immune system whether a cell is a
friend or foe. The gene codes for what's called a transplantation
protein, a surface badge that causes the immune system to reject
transplanted tissue.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Michigan group encased the gene in a liposome, a fatty globe
of material that helped the gene slide into the tumor cell's inner
reaches. In the test, the scientists found that once inside the
cell, the gene produced the new foreign protein, which emerged on
the cell's surface. The foreign protein then triggered the immune
system to produce white blood cells whose normal job is to kill
invading bacteria or viruses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We suspect tumors grow when they somehow evade detection from
the immune system," Gary Nabel said in an interview. "Our goal with
this technique is to alert the immune system to the tumor."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The scientists found that in one patient, the gene injected into
a tumor cell generated an attack that wiped out the tumor and also
stirred an attack on tumors elsewhere in the patient's body. Dr.
Nabel said the key to the technique will be its ability to stimulate
a bodywide immune-system attack, since it will be impractical to
directly inject the gene material into every cancer cell.

Gene Therapy Method May Offer Hope
In Treating Anemia With Protein EPO
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By Jerry E. Bishop
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>553 words</div><div>10 November 1993</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>PAGE B5</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
ATLANTA -- Medical researchers said they are experimenting with a
gene therapy technique to provide patients suffering from severe
anemia with a long-lasting internal source of erythropoietin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Erythropoietin, or EPO, is the protein the body uses to stimulate
production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells. Patients with kidney
failure, AIDS and other life-threatening diseases often need
additional EPO to raise their red blood cell count in order to
overcome their anemia. Currently, they must receive repeated
infusions of a genetically engineered form of EPO.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gene therapy approach to providing a patient with a
continuous source of EPO is still in the stage of animal experiments
and thus may well fail to work. However, if the animal experiments
are successful, the technique probably will be ready for its first
human trials in about a year, Jeffrey Leiden, a University of
Chicago scientist working on the technique, told reporters during
the annual scientific sessions of the American Heart Association.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technique's possible development is of considerable interest
not only to AIDS and kidney patients but also to Amgen Inc., the
Thousand Oaks, Calif., biotechnology company. Amgen produces and
sells about $500 million a year of a genetically engineered form of
human EPO, trade-named Epogen. Johnson & Johnson sells another brand
of the same product under the name Procrit. Dr. Leiden, who is an
adviser to Vical Inc., one of the biotechnology companies interested
in the new technique, said the gene therapy approach to treating
anemia is potentially useful in the 50,000 AIDS patients and 85,000
kidney patients who currently must receive infusions of Epogen.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We at Amgen will be watching developments as they occur," a
spokesman said. "The data are obviously extremely early, and a lot
can happen during the clinical trial process." A spokesman for
Johnson & Johnson declined to comment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Leiden said he and his colleagues are working on the idea of
inserting the human gene for EPO into immature muscle cells, called
myoblasts, grown in the test tube. Myoblasts are unusual because
when transplanted or injected into a patient, they can lodge in the
patient's own muscles and function there.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The hope is that once the myoblasts establish themselves in the
patient's body, they'll steadily secrete human EPO into the
bloodstream, obviating the need for repeated infusions of
genetically engineered EPO. Dr. Leiden noted that AIDS patients and
patients in kidney failure require infusions of EPO two or three
times a week, even daily in some cases.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Leiden said the use of genetically altered myoblasts is being
considered for a number of other diseases. Myoblasts carrying human
genes for the proteins that cause blood to clot are being developed
as possible treatments for hemophilia, for example, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The scientist said that within a year, researchers should be
ready to ask federal agencies for clearance to begin human trials of
gene therapies using myoblasts. He cautioned, however, that since
Amgen's EPO is already available, there may not be as much urgency
to approve the gene therapy approach for life-threatening anemias as
there might be for a disease which can't yet be treated.

Gene Therapy Repairs
Some Cells in Patients
With Cystic Fibrosis

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
DALLAS -- Researchers said they used gene therapy to repair some
human cells that carry the genetic defect that causes cystic
fibrosis, an inherited disorder characterized by respiratory
infection and malfunction of the pancreas affecting about 30,000
people in the U.S.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers at University of Iowa College of Medicine said an
experiment involving cells in the noses of three patients showed for
the first time that human cells can be repaired using gene-therapy
technology. But the researchers have yet to show the technique can
provide a clinical benefit to patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's a very important step forward because it shows you can
correct cells" in human subjects, said Ronald Crystal, a
gene-therapy researcher at Cornell University Medical Center, New
York.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Iowa research team, led by Michael Welsh, corrected the gene
defect by infecting nose cells with a cold virus in which the
cold-causing part of the virus was removed. Cells removed from the
nasal lining showed that the human protein that is defective in all
cells in cystic-fibrosis patients was properly working. The Iowa
team presented its research at a cystic fibrosis conference here.
The research will be fully reported next week in the scientific
journal Cell.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This year, Dr. Crystal's lab at Cornell used a similar technique
to transfer a healthy gene to the lung tissue of four patients. But
there is little evidence that those cells have been repaired. Six
separate laboratories in the U.S. and one in Britain are developing
similar research efforts.

Researchers Get Approval From Panel
For Test on Gene Therapy Against HIV

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers at the University of California at San Diego got a
green light from the federal Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee to
conduct a safety test of a new gene therapy against human
immunodeficiency virus, or HIV.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The proposed clinical test is the second proposed gene therapy
against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, to receive the committee's
approval. Still pending is approval by the director of the National
Institutes of Health, and the Food and Drug Administration.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers Flossie Wong-Staal and David Looney and their
colleagues at the university plan to recruit six HIV-positive
volunteers to receive a single dose of genetically altered cells.
This initial dose is solely for purposes of assessing safety and
"will probably not be enough to affect progression of their
disease," the university cautioned in a statement.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Wong-Staal, who formerly worked in the laboratory of Robert
Gallo of the National Cancer Institute, plans to draw volunteers'
blood and isolate certain white blood cells to use as carriers for a
therapeutic gene. Then these blood cells will then be reinfused into
the patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At the heart of the therapy is a molecule discovered last year by
Dr. Wong-Staal and colleagues that can thwart the AIDS virus by
cutting its genetic material known as RNA, or ribonucleic acid. Once
inserted into the blood cells, the molecule, known as a "hairpin
ribozyme," inhibits the virus in two ways: by preventing HIV from
infecting new cells, and also by disabling HIV inside an
already-infected cell so that new copies of the virus can't be
released to spread the infection.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Pending final approvals, the safety trial should begin within the
year as a prelude to a larger study of the treatment's
effectiveness, the university said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Wong-Staal said in a statement she believes "At its root, HIV
is a genetic disease; the virus integrates itself into the genetic
code of the infected cell. This makes us hopeful that there may be
an effective treatment for HIV at the genetic level."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among the many hurdles faced by gene therapy researchers is the
search for a longer-lasting method to deliver and maintain the
therapeutic gene in the body. To this end, Dr. Wong-Staal's group is
also working on the next stage of their project to insert the
"hairpin ribozyme" into long-lasting stem cells. Stem cells, which
give rise to all of the body's red and white blood cells, can
survive for decades in the bloodstream, potentially sustaining the
gene therapy for the lifetime of a patient.

dystrophy, according to University of Michigan researchers. But, the
researchers caution, it will be years before the treatment can be
tried in humans.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy is an experimental procedure to correct a medical
disorder by replacing or counteracting a faulty gene. Gene therapy
approaches are being tested to treat a wide variety of genetic
diseases, such as cystic fibrosis, hemophilia, immune system
disorders, and Gaucher's disease. Previous attempts at using gene
therapy to treat muscular dystrophy demonstrated its potential but
produced only limited results.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A study reported in this week's Nature, however, provided strong
evidence of gene therapy's ability to cure disease, in this case,
Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We now have confidence, which we lacked up until this discovery,
that this research will pay off," said Donald Wood, director of
science technology for the Muscular Dystrophy Association.
Encouraged by the latest results, the association will focus its
research efforts on the gene therapy approach, Dr. Wood said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The findings will be highlighted on the association's annual
fund-raising telethon next month, Dr. Wood said. The group spends
about $20 million a year on muscular dystrophy research and
partially funded the University of Michigan study, published in
today's Nature journal. Government and nonprofit foundations also
provided funding.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Duchenne muscular dystrophy, the most common form of childhood
muscular dystrophy, affects one out of every 3,500 males. (Females
can carry the disease but rarely develop symptoms.) The disease is
caused by a defect in the gene that makes dystrophin, a critical
protein necessary to keep muscle tissue from breaking down. The
defective gene's failure to produce dystrophin causes muscles to
progressively weaken, leading to paralysis and the patient's death
from heart or respiratory failure, usually by his mid-20s.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A milder form of the disease, Becker muscular dystrophy, results
from different defects in the same gene, which still is able to
produce some dystrophin. About 350,000 patients world-wide have
Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophies.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A gene therapy technique for muscular dystrophy reported two
years ago showed that a corrected form of the defective gene
injected into leg and heart muscles of mice produced dystrophin, but
it worked only in muscle tissue near the injection site. Any viable
treatment for the disease needs to reach all muscles in the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The dystrophin gene is the largestknown gene, too large in fact
to work with in the laboratory. In the University of Michigan study,
researchers constructed a miniature version of the gene made up of
just the portions responsible for dystrophin production. In doing
so, however, they lost the genetic information that controls when,
where, and how much protein is produced. These "switches," for
example, make sure the protein is produced only in the specific
muscle cells where it is needed and isn't produced in other cells,
such as in the liver or skin.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers replaced the lost switches by splicing onto the
miniature genes similar controlling mechanisms found in other genes.
They then injected copies of the new gene into fertilized eggs of
mice that had the naturally occurring, defective dystrophin gene. As
the embryonic cells multiplied, so did the corrected gene, spreading
the genetic information throughout every cell in the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After birth, the mice grew up disease-free. The researchers
tested strips of diaphragm muscle, which controls breathing, from
normal mice, untreated mice with the genetic defect, and treated
mice with both the defective and corrected gene. The diaphragm
muscles of normal and treated mice functioned similarly, but the
untreated mice had severely damaged and impaired diaphragm muscles.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers also measured blood levels of an enzyme, creatine
kinase, which helps maintain muscle energy levels. The enzyme is
normally present only in trace amounts in the blood, but in muscular
dystrophy patients, it is released into the bloodstream as muscle
tissue breaks down. There weren't any significant differences in
creatine kinase blood levels found in the normal and treated mice,
but the untreated mice had 10 times higher levels.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The corrected gene produced as much as 50 times the normal amount
of dystrophin, but the treated mice didn't exhibit any side effects.
"We were unable to find anything remotely wrong with these mice,"
said Jeffrey S. Chamberlain of the University of Michigan and lead
researcher in the study.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study shows that if scientists can get a version of the
corrected gene into a patient's muscle, it will correct the symptoms
of the disease, Dr. Chamberlain said. But, he warned that the method
used in mice is "too crude" to use in human embryos. Instead,
researchers are searching for viruses that can carry the corrected
gene into every muscle tissue.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This study is a big step but still just the first step," Dr.
Chamberlain said.

DNA Injection
In Gene Therapy
Is Called Success

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
SAN FRANCISCO -- Scientists at the University of California
reported success with a new model of gene therapy involving direct
injection of DNA, the raw material of genes, into mice.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The group eventually aims to apply the technique to a search for
gene therapy against the life-threatening lung disease cystic
fibrosis.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most experimental gene therapy involves a complicated process of
removing cells, genetically engineering them in a test tube and
re-infusing them into the patient.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, Robert Debs of UCSF's Cancer Research Institute said he
successfully inserted a new gene into many tissues and cells by
directly injecting DNA encased in liposomes, a fatty substance used
in drug delivery. It's a method that has attracted interest, but
only limited success.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"People have tried direct injection of DNA before and gotten low
level expression of the gene in one tissue type," Dr. Debs said in
an interview. "This is certainly the first time we've gotten
expression in most cells and all tissue types."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Debs said the gene had been taken up and expressed by the
majority of T-lymphocytes, white blood cells crucial to the immune
response. A wide range of organ systems had taken up the gene,
including lymph nodes, spleen, mammary gland and bone marrow.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It looks like these liposomes are universal carriers that can
reach most kinds of cells," he added. Dr. Debs and his co-workers
published their findings in this week's issue of the journal
Science, which described their report in its weekly press advisory
as a "breakthrough."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The research's next phase involved injecting a gene called CFTR
-- which carries the mutation responsible for cystic fibrosis --
into mice, sheep and rhesus monkeys.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It's worked well in all three species," he said. "We've seen it
expressed in target cells of the lungs of mice for up to six months
after a single injection, and in ongoing studies in monkeys for at
least four weeks."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Debs team is working with the private, year-old biotechnology
company Megabios Corp. of San Francisco, which is backed by venture
capitalists William Brown and Frank Caufield.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
With its focus on cystic fibrosis, the UCSF-Megabios group enters
a field staked out four months ago by Genentech Inc. of South San
Francisco and a private collaborator, GenVec of Montgomery County,
Md. GenVec is developing technology that uses a disabled version of
the virus that causes the common cold as a carrier for inserting the
corrective gene into lung cells.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- Michael D. Casey, a top Johnson & Johnson
manager, moved to Genetic Therapy Inc., a small biotechnology
concern here, to become its president and chief operating officer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Casey, 46 years old, was president of J&J's McNeil
Pharmaceutical subsidiary, which was merged with another J&J unit,
Ortho Pharmaceutical Corp., this year in a cost-cutting move.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Casey succeeds M. James Barrett, 50, as president of Genetic
Therapy. Mr. Barrett remains chief executive officer and becomes
chairman.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Casey said he made the move to the smaller company because he
saw health care moving toward technologies like the company's gene
therapy products. "I believe that the field is emerging and is
prepared to break loose," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Mr. Casey declined to divulge his compensation, which he said was
comparable to his package at J&J, but acknowledged that the equity
portion was higher at Genetic Therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Noting other recent moves by pharmaceutical executives to small
biotech companies, John T.W. Hawkins, the executive recruiter who
arranged the Genetic Therapy placement, said, "The equity play is
obviously the draw for many of these executives in evaluating small
and emerging companies." But, he added, "fundamentally, it's the
excitement and challenge of building an emerging pharmaceutical
company" that attracts the executives.

SAN FRANCISCO -- Gene-therapy efforts to treat immune-system
diseases advanced over the weekend with a new procedure to help
newborns by altering blood cells from their umbilical cords.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new procedure represents a gain from previous attempts at
gene therapy of a genetic disease, in which deficient white blood
cells were extracted from children with the disease, genetically
made correct, and then returned to the body in repeated infusions.
Using the umbilical cord, scientists hope to get closer to the
source of genetic diseases by altering stem cells, which are in the
bone marrow and give rise to all the other cells of the blood
system.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the latest procedure, the cells of two newborns, one in Los
Angeles and the other in San Francisco, were extracted from the
umbilical cords for insertion of a missing gene that will boost
their immune systems, said the University of California at San
Francisco.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The university said the procedure is the first ever using the
umbilical cord, and is being carried out in collaboration with the
National Institutes of Health. The university is doing the procedure
with the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles, which has the
sophisticated cell-separation equipment necessary for the procedure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Los Angeles baby, born last Tuesday, has received its
engineered cells, and the San Francisco baby is expected to receive
its cells in the next two days. Both suffer from severe combined
immunodeficiency, a rare genetic disorder which renders the body
totally helpless against infectious diseases.

Bayer Unit and Viagene
Join on Gene Therapy
To Treat Hemophilia

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
PITTSBURGH -- Miles Inc., the U.S. unit of Bayer AG, said it
reached a three-year agreement to collaborate with Viagene Inc. of
San Diego on a gene therapy system to treat Hemophilia A.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The deal makes Miles the first major pharmaceutical concern to
back research for gene therapy treatment for hemophilia, experts in
the field say. Gene therapy is basically a delivery system that uses
de-activated retroviruses to carry therapeutic genes to living
cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under terms of the agreement, Miles will invest $9 million and
contribute a certain blood-clotting gene, Factor VIII, licensed from
Genentech Inc. of South San Francisco. Viagene will supply a
particular type of virus called a retrovirus that would carry the
Factor VIII to living cells, enabling patients to produce their own
blood-clotting protein, which hemophiliacs lack.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Viagene would have the manufacturing rights and Miles would have
world-wide marketing rights. Miles would have the right to buy out
Viagene's manufacturing rights.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The treatment is years away from beginning clinical trials and is
at least a decade away from market, said George Scangos, senior vice
president of Miles' pharmaceutical division. But if the treated
cells continue to manufacture blood-clotting protein, Hemophilia A
patients could theoretically be cured with just one gene therapy
treatment, instead of the weekly Factor VIII infusions they require
now. Even if the treated cells can produce Factor VIII for only a
few weeks, that would dramatically reduce the number of treatments
required.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The treatment could eventually replace a synthetic Factor VIII
product, Kogenate, which Miles has been developing as an alternative
to Factor VIII, which is derived from plasma. Miles said it has
spent $250 million developing Kogenate over the past decade, and
hopes to get Food and Drug Administration approval for the product
later this year.

`Gene Therapy' for Gaucher's Disease
Shows Promising Results in Test on Mice
</b>
</div><div class="author">
By David Stipp
</div><div>Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</div>
<div>722 words</div><div>3 December 1992</div><div>The Wall Street Journal</div><div>J</div><div>PAGE B6</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
University of Pittsburgh researchers reported promising results
in mice with a potential "gene therapy" for Gaucher's disease that
eventually may replace Ceredase, a Genzyme Corp. drug whose high
cost has sparked controversy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The study indicated it would be possible to transfer a gene into
certain cells of people with the disease that would permanently
correct a genetic defect underlying their disorder. The potential
treatment, however, is at least several years away from wide-spread
use in patients, and its development may face economic stumbling
blocks. The Pittsburgh study is reported in the current issue of the
Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gaucher's disease is a rare, inherited disorder caused by a
defective gene that usually produces an enzyme needed by cells to
break down certain molecules. The disorder causes the build-up of
waste products in cells, inducing liver enlargement, anemia and
other problems. Currently, the only widely used treatment for it is
Ceredase, which replaces the missing enzyme.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ceredase has been cited often by drug-industry critics in the
national debate about sky-rocketing health-care costs. A
congressional report this fall stated that the drug can cost
individual patients up to $500,000 annually, potentially exhausting
their medical benefits within a few years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Genzyme, a Cambridge, Mass., biotechnology concern, disputes the
report, asserting that an individual's costs of the drug typically
fall to $60,000 or less annually as doses are gradually lowered in
the first two years of treatment. But even at lower doses, assert
critics, the required lifelong treatment with the drug could
eventually exhaust patients' benefits, which typically have lifetime
caps of $1 million.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy might someday replace Ceredase with a permanent cure
for the disease, said John Barranger, who led the Pittsburgh study.
His team stitched the gene for the Gaucher's disease enzyme into
certain viruses, then allowed the viruses to infect bone marrow
cells extracted from mice. The viruses transferred the gene into the
cells, which were reintroduced into mice after their existing bone
marrow cells had been knocked out by radiation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In later tests, the scientists found that the genetically altered
marrow cells had proliferated, as they had hoped, into microscopic
factories producing the enzyme in copious quantities. The
researchers hope next year to begin human clinical trials with the
technique, which also has been tested in animals with promising
results by a team at the National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But questions remain about using the method in humans, including
whether it would work without destroying patients' existing bone
marrow cells before introducing the new ones, said Dr. Barranger. If
that is required, the procedure probably would be too risky to
pursue as a therapy. The cost of long-term studies on the procedure
may also deter its commercial development, given that an effective
drug exists to treat Gaucher's disease, said Alison Taunton-Rigby, a
Genzyme senior vice president.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Separately, researchers reported in today's issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine that Ceredase's costs could be
drastically cut by using more frequent, lower doses than are usually
given. The researchers at Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla,
Calif., reported that in 14 patients treated with small doses of
Ceredase given three to seven times a week, "approximately the same"
results were attained as have been reported in patients who received
four to five times as much of the drug in bi-weekly doses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers, led by Michael Figueroa and Ernest Beutler,
recommend that the high starting doses of Ceredase now usually given
be cut to about a fourth as much in doses given thrice weekly.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
More frequent doses, however, have drawbacks, including the cost
of added intravenous infusions and inconvenience to patients of
often returning to outpatient clinics for treatments, said a Genzyme
spokeswoman. Norman Barton, a National Institutes of Health
researcher who helped develop Ceredase, also questioned whether the
patients in the Scripps study were generally representative of
Gaucher's disease patients. He noted that 11 of the 14 Scripps
patients had had their spleens removed due to the disease,
potentially altering their response to the drug compared with
patients who still have their spleens.
