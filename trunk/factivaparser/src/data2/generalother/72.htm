<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a rare success for the much-headlined vision of gene therapy, scientists said they had corrected flawed DNA in an 18-year-old man suffering from a debilitating form of anemia. The unnamed patient received a gene that corrected a blood disorder known as beta-thalassaemia and three years on, his health is "remarkable" and his quality of life good, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Beta-thalassaemia occurs when a patient is unable to produce enough beta-globin, a component in hemoglobin, which is used by red blood cells to transport oxygen around the body. The body's organs, depriving of sufficient oxygen, can be badly damaged without regular, and lifelong, blood transfusions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The alternative treatment is bone marrow transplant, but only a small minority of patients have access to this because of difficulties in finding the right type of donor.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Clad in a yellow gown, blue foot covers, hair net, face mask and latex gloves, Paula Cannon pushed open the door to the animal room. "I hate this smell," she said, wrinkling her nose.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The stink came from scores of little white mice scurrying about in cages. Some of the cages were marked with red biohazard signs, indicating mice that had been injected with HIV.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet, in some of the animals -- ones with a small genetic change -- the virus never took hold. Like mouse, like man? Maybe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In early 2007, a patient in Berlin needed a bone-marrow transplant to treat his leukemia. He was also HIV-positive, and his doctor had an idea: Why not use the marrow from one of the rare individuals who are naturally resistant to HIV and try to eradicate both diseases at once?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It worked. Sixty-one days after the patient's transplant, his virus levels were undetectable, and they've stayed that way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since news of the man's cure broke, HIV patients have been telephoning doctors to ask for bone-marrow transplants. But it's not that simple. The treatment is too risky and impractical for widespread use.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A bone-marrow transplant -- it's a horrible process you would not wish on your worst enemy unless they needed one to save their life," said Cannon, a biology professor at USC's Keck School of Medicine. There are gruelling treatments to prepare a patient for transplant; the danger of rejecting the marrow; and the risk of graft-versus-host disease, wherein the marrow attacks the patient.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And that's assuming the patient can find a matching donor -- a difficult proposition in itself -- with the right HIVresistant genetic constitution, which is present in only about one per cent of the Caucasian population. But there could be another way.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead of sifting through the sands for a rare donor and then subjecting a patient to the dangers of a bone-marrow transplant, Cannon and her colleague Philip Gregory, chief scientific officer at the Richmond, Calif.-based biotech company Sangamo Bio-Sciences, began to think: They could use gene therapy instead, to tweak a patient's own cells to resistance -- and recovery.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The mouse "cure," they say, suggests they're on the right track.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, with $14.5 million US from the California Institute for Regenerative Medicine, the San Francisco-based stem-cell research-funding centre created by 2004's Proposition 71, Cannon, Gregory and researchers at the City of Hope cancer centre in Duarte, Cailf., are working toward bringing the technique to clinical trials within four years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cannon and other HIV researchers insist that, despite cancers and deaths associated with past gene therapy trials, it's the right way to target the disease. They cite recent successes, including treatments that cured children with the "bubble boy" syndrome and helped blind children regain their vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I don't think anyone would want to do gene therapy if there were an alternative," said Caltech biologist David Baltimore, one of the many L.A.-based researchers pursuing gene therapy strategies to prevent or cure HIV. "I think it's absolutely necessary. Nothing else will work."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Since AIDS emerged in the early 1980s, development of anti-HIV medications has turned the disease from a virtual death sentence into a chronic, manageable condition. But the clamour for a cure hasn't quieted.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Vaccine trials have failed; drug-resistant strains are on the rise; and the meds, which can have uncomfortable side effects such as fatigue, nausea and redistribution of body fat that creates a so-called buffalo hump, cost about $20,000 a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A bone-marrow transplant is about five times as expensive, but it would have to be done only once. The question was, could researchers create bone marrow stem cells that -- just like the marrow the Berlin patient received -- lack the crucial gene, CCR5, that normally lets HIV into the key immune cells it destroys?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 2006, Gregory asked Cannon if she was interested in testing whether a tool his company developed, called a zinc finger nuclease, could do the trick.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Zinc finger nucleases are genetic scissors, cutting DNA at a specific site -- say, in the middle of the CCR5 gene. When the cell glues the gene back together, it usually makes a mistake, resulting in a gene that no longer works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It just jumped out at me as, 'Oh my gosh, that's actually something that could work,'" Cannon said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team spent about a year optimizing the procedure for treating delicate stem cells with the CCR5 snippers. They tested the method using so-called humanized mice -- ones engineered to have a human immune system -- because HIV doesn't infect normal mice. When stem cells were treated with the molecular scissors before being injected into mice, the resulting immune system lacked CCR5, exactly as the scientists had hoped. These mice acted just like the Berlin patient -- they fought off the virus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ready to make the leap from mouse to man, Gregory found a third leg for the team: researchers at City of Hope, who had extensive bone marrow transplant expertise.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They brought Paula's data to us and we said, 'Wow, this looks fantastic,'" said Dr. John Zaia, City of Hope's deputy director for clinical research.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers there are now working toward clinical trials, optimizing every element of the treatment for safety, effectiveness and reproducibility.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To receive FDA approval for clinical trials -- a goal they hope to achieve in three to four years -- the researchers must prove that they can safely and reliably prepare the cells. Once they get the green light, the first cases will probably be people like the Berlin patient who need bone marrow transplants to treat AIDS-related lymphoma.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They'll modify the patients' cells in the stringently sterile manufacturing lab that DiGiusto designed with details such as cove moulding and seamless floors so there are no corners or cracks to collect dust. Anyone who enters must wear a full bunny suit, much like the one Cannon wears in her mouse room, to keep from contaminating the delicate cells.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers have discovered antibodies that can protect against a wide range of AIDS viruses and say they may be able to use them to design a vaccine against the fatal and incurable virus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bodies of some people make these immune system proteins after they are infected with the AIDS virus, when it is too late for them to do much good. However, a properly designed vaccine might help the body make them much sooner, the researchers reported in today's issue of the journal Science.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am more optimistic about an AIDS vaccine at this point in time than I have been probably in the last 10 years," said Dr. Gary Nabel of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, who led the study.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two of the antibodies can attach to and neutralize 90 per cent of the various mutations of the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, Nabel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is an antibody that evolved after the fact. That is part of the problem we have in dealing with HIV: Once a person becomes infected, the virus always gets ahead of the immune system," Nabel said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we are trying to do with a vaccine is get ahead of the virus."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AIDS infects about 33 million people globally, according to the United Nations AIDS agency UNAIDS. It has killed 25 million people since the early 1980s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virus is difficult to fight in part because it attacks immune system cells and because it mutates constantly, making it a moving target for drugs or the immune system. Researchers have been looking for parts of the virus that do not mutate so they can design vaccines that will protect against these constantly changing versions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nabel's team found two of the antibodies in the blood of a patient infected with HIV who had not become ill despite the infection.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition to creating a vaccine, it may also be possible to design gene therapy to help patients make these antibodies themselves or use an older technique that transfuses the antibodies directly.</p>

<div>410 words</div><div>9 July 2010</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2010 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team of Canadian researchers have discovered a way to slow the spread of melanoma cells, a finding that could offer hope for those who suffer from one of the most deadly forms of skin cancer.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's important research," said Dr. Victor Tron, head of pathology and molecular medicine at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., where the study took place.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The group of nine researchers learned over the course of three years of experiments that melanoma, a rare skin cancer that causes 75 per cent of skin cancer deaths, can be slowed when a little known gene called MicroRNA 193b is added to the cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In theory, the findings will help doctors provide gene therapy for people with cancer, which could slow down the spread of melanoma and make patients more receptive to chemotherapy or other drugs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It may even stop melanoma all together," said Tron, who has been treating people with skin cancer for more than 25 years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings, published in a recent issue of the American Journal of Pathology, were the result of a trial-and-error process that began with the understanding that 193b was an important gene.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What scientists discovered was the gene, present in benign human cells, is noticeably absent from malignant ones. When added to melanoma cells, it works by regulating a protein called cyclin D1 which causes melanoma cells to multiply.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you don't have enough of that 193b, you have too much of the cyclin D1, which causes our cells to grow quickly. And really, cancer is a problem in part of cells growing too quickly," said Tron.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Once you put in the 193b back into the cells, they start doing their business. So they're going to stop making the cyclin D1 or regulating it, and the cells basically slow down to a real profound effect."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 193b gene is one of 1,000 microRNA genes that regulate some 30,000 protein-making genes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tron said researchers are also studying other microRNA genes to determine what role they play in slowing melanoma growth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melanoma, a growing problem, affects up to one in 70 Canadians, said Tron. He recommends people monitor their moles and notify a doctor if they change colour or grow.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's something that we all have to be aware of and look out for."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A research team from the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute is embarking on a five-year, $1.4-million project to develop a new gene therapy to prevent blindness due to retinal diseases.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retina is the inner lining of the eye that senses light. Millions of North Americans suffer from diseases such as retinitis pigmentosa, glaucoma, retinal ischemia and age-related macular degeneration. Although the causes differ, these diseases all end in the same: Retinal cells die, leading to blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researcher Catherine Tsilfidis, who's also a University of Ottawa medical professor, has shown that a gene called XIAP can prevent retinal cell death. The gene can be delivered to the eye using a virus called Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV). The goal of the project is to begin testing the therapy in patients within the next five years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The project is being funded by the Foundation Fighting Blindness, a private charity and the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The discovery of a 4.4-million-year-old skeleton, human-kind's oldest known ancestor, was the greatest scientific breakthrough of 2009, the prestigious journal Science said on yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fossil, known as Ardi, topped a list of the 10 greatest scientific advances for the year, which also featured the discovery of water on the moon and the use of ultra-thin carbon atom sheets in experimental electronic devices.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ardi, or Ardipithecus ramidus, was the subject of 15 years of painstaking examination by anthropologists who said the find, in what is now Ethiopia, provided untold insights into human evolution.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At 1.2 million years older than "Lucy," previously the oldest known human ancestor, Ardi helped shatter popular myths about the direct similarity between humans and modern apes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of the traits found in Ardi's skull, teeth, pelvis, hands and feet, showed that African apes have evolved extensively since sharing a common ancestor with humans.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"(Ardi) changes the way we think about early human evolution," said Bruce Alberts, Science's editor.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among the other developments listed by the journal were the discovery of previously unknown pulsars by NASA's Fermi telescope, including one located 4,600 light-years from Earth.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The observations helped explain how a pulsar - the rapidly-spinning and highly-magnetized core of a exploded star - works, and how they contribute to electromagnetic radiation in the universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Astrophysics provided two more of the top 10 advances of the year, including NASA's discovery of ice water on the moon.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In October the U.S. space agency slammed a missile into the permanently shadowed Cabeus crater, near the moon's southern pole, at around 5,600 miles (9,000 kilometres) per hour.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was followed four minutes later by a spacecraft equipped with instruments that detected significant amounts of ice water.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NASA was also praised by Science for astronauts' repairs of the Hubble space telescope, providing unprecedented images of our universe.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Meanwhile physicists working with bizarre crystalline materials managed to create magnetic ripples that could help confirm the existence of monopoles, a theoretical particle with only one magnetic pole.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And physicists operating an X-ray laser at Stanford University got fresh snap-shots of chemical reactions in progress and molecules 10,000 times smaller than a human hair.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The year also saw the advances in the way we use materials, including graphene - highly conductive sheets of carbon atoms.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists examining the ultra-thin structures were able for the first time to manipulate them into nano-scale electronic devices, raising hopes that the advance could spark an entire industry.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the biological sciences breakthroughs were made in gene therapy and signal pathways, which offer the hope of extending human life.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While gene therapists developed new ways to treat brain disease, hereditary blindness and some immune disorders, those working on signal pathways developed a drug that extended the life-span of mice by around 10 per cent.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was the first time the drug, rapamycin, had been proven to work on mammals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As climate change topped the political agenda, scientists grasped a clearer picture of plant molecules that could allow them to develop new ways to protect crops against drought.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the coming year Science's editors said they expect breakthroughs in stem cell research, cancer cell metabolism and the mapping of the human genome.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the White House set to decide on funding, the future of human space flight and NASA's quest to return man to the moon by 2020 and establish lunar bases for further exploration to Mars, may also be decided.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have managed to halt a rare and fatal brain disease with an experimental gene therapy technique using a deactivated version of the AIDS virus, a study has shown.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The international team used a disabled form of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) to deliver working genes to two boys with the brain disease X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). Their success may help shape future treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patrick Aubourg of Inserm- Université Paris Descartes, who led the study, said it was the first time scientists had successfully used an HIV-derived delivery technique for gene therapy in humans, and the first time gene therapy had been used effectively in a severe brain disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Up to now we have treated two boys ... and we can say with confidence that more than two years after gene therapy their brain disease has been arrested," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Featured in the 1992 movie Lorenzo's Oil, ALD is a rare hereditary condition caused by a deficiency of a protein involved in fatty acid degradation. Sufferers gradually lose the myelin sheath, a protective layer coating the brain's nerve fibres, leading to disabilities such as blindness, deafness, seizures and progressive dementia. X-linked ALD, the most common form, affects boys from about 6 years old, and they usually die before reaching adolescence.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disease can be halted using bone marrow transplants because the donor marrow includes cells that develop into myelin-producing cells.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian scientists have developed a new process to heal damaged lungs before they are transplanted into a patient's body, which could triple the number of successful lung transplants and have future implications for healing other organs.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For the first time, researchers at Toronto's McEwen Centre for Regenerative Medicine and the Toronto General Hospital have successfully used gene therapy to repair injured human donor lungs. Their study was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When an organ donor succumbs to brain death, the lungs can become inflamed, causing injury and making them unfit for donation or difficult for the recipient's body to accept. Lead researcher Dr. Shaf Keshavjee says around 20 to 30 per cent of people who receive a lung transplant die from complications. And, he says, more than 80 per cent of donor lungs are damaged.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new process, which uses a machine called the Toronto Lung Perfusion System to warm the lungs to body temperature, continuously pumps a solution of oxygen, proteins and nutrients into injured donor lungs, mimicking normal physiological conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves," said Keshavjee. "It opens the door to genetically prepare organs to donate."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study found that the lungs maintained on the machine, which was developed in Toronto, did not deteriorate and remained stable, and those which received the gene therapy improved blood flow throughout the lungs and their ability to take in fresh oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers found the lungs begin producing the new anti-inflammatory proteins about six hours after insertion.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Part of the problem with the current method of storing transplanted organs -- cold preservation -- is that the organ is only reliable for up to 12 hours. With this technique, the lungs can be preserved for up to 24 hours, said Keshavjee.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With cold preservation of organs, scientists essentially cool them down to slow the dying process, but with this new technique, they are keeping the lung alive and repairing it at the same time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The scientists have performed successful transplants on animals. Keshavjee believes they will be ready for clinical human trials within two or three years. He also believes the technique will eventually triple the number of lungs suitable for transplant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Between 1997 and 2006, 299 Canadians died while waiting for a lung transplant.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Canada, the number of people waiting for a lung transplant has doubled in the past 10 years, with 252 Canadians waiting to receive a lung transplant in 2006, compared to 119 in 1997.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Toronto has long been a world leader in lung transplantation. The first successful lung transplant was performed in Toronto in 1983 and the first double lung transplant was completed there three years later.</p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exhilarated scientists on Saturday announced they had used gene therapy to restore eyesight to children blighted by a rare, inherited form of creeping blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Youngsters were able to walk unaided around dimly-lit obstacles, take part in lessons at school without extra help--and one child saw the colour of his father's eyes for the very first time.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The revolutionary treatment targets a disease of light-catching retinal cells called Leber's congenital amaurosis, or LCA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Caused by flaws in any one of around 13 key genes, LCA triggers severe loss of vision and abnormal eye movements in early infancy, usually leading to total blindness in the 20s or 30s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors led by Jean Bennett of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine tested a way of tackling this tragedy by inserting a corrective gene in a disabled cold virus.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their study was published online by The Lancet on Saturday, coinciding with a presentation at a conference of American ophthalmologists in San Francisco.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modified virus was injected into the eyeball and infected the diseased cells--in effect, acting like a Trojan horse to deliver the right DNA to the retina. Twelve patients aged eight to 44 years were recruited in the small, experimental study, and were given the treatment in the eye that had the worst vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the patients recovered normal sight, but all of them had an at-least 100-fold increase in so-called pupillary light response, meaning the constriction of the pupil when exposed to light. Six of the 12 recovered sufficient sight that meant they may no longer be classified as legally blind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The best results were among four children aged eight, nine, 10 and 11. All four gained vision that enabled them to walk unaided along a dimly-lit simulated street route.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Another child, who since birth, could only see light and shadows, stared into his father's face and said he could see the colour of his eyes. Later they played soccer together," the university said in a release. Normally reserved, researchers used such words as "dramatic" and "spectacular" to describe the outcome, even though the trial is only a Phase 1 test, the first and most cautious level of a three-phase process to assess prototype treatments for safety and effectiveness. It comes less than six weeks after another breakthrough in gene vision therapy, in which two monkeys were cured of colour blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene medicine is one of the most alluring areas of biotechnology, offering the theoretical promise of blocking or reversing inherited disease.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">U. S. scientists have replaced genetic material in monkeys using a method that could prevent dozens of incurable hereditary diseases from being passed from mother to child, said a new study on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think this technique could be applied very quickly in humans, and that it will work," said Shoukhrat Mitalipov, who led a team of researchers at the Oregon National Primate Research Center.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Many of the procedures we developed could be simply mirrored to existing clinical in-vitro fertilization (IVF)procedures used in humans," he told journalists by phone.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In experiments on rhesus monkeys, hereditary material was removed from an egg containing defective mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA, and inserted into a healthy donor egg stripped of its own heriditary package, called a spindle.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The modified eggs were then fertilized with sperm, implanted in females and carried to term.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So far we have produced four infants by this method"--named Mito, Tracker, Spindler and Spindy -- "and they are all healthy," said lead author Masahito Tachibana.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In humans, the new procedure would allow a couple to have a child who is biologically their own, but who is free of any condition associated with maternal mtDNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mitochondria, found in the fluid inside an egg cell, are tiny structures that produce energy to power the cell's activities. Unlike DNA, which is a merger of male and female chromosomes, mitochondria are transmitted only from mother to child.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the last 20 years, mtDNA has been directly linked to more than 150 incurable human conditions.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier studies have estimated one newborn in 200 carry mtDNA mutations which--even if they do not cause disease in that individual --can become more concentrated over generations.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One in 3,500-to-6,000 people are thought to have mutations in the mtDNA that may or will cause disease. Some are rare and crippling degenerative disorders uniquely caused by mutations in mtDNA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MERRF, for example, begins in childhood and leads to epilepsy, muscle wasting, deafness and dementia. Another condition, known by the acronym LHON, causes blindness, impaired co-ordination, mild dementia and heart defects.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But mtDNA have also been linked to cancer and diabetes, along with neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's and Huntington's.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Whether mutation in mtDNA can cause any of these diseases by itself, or whether it always acts in concert with other genetic or environmental factors, is still unclear. In either case, though, the technique could pave the way for gene replacement therapy that simply removes disease-causing mitochondria from a family's hereditary chain.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year after receiving gene therapy for a condition that causes total blindness by age 30, three people continue to show improved vision, U.S. researchers said Wednesday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Improvements in the vision of the three volunteers -- all legally blind and in their 20s -- has not deteriorated over time, doctors involved in the experiment reported in New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the three has also developed a kind of "second sight" because her brain has learned to tap information from an area of the retina rejuvenated by gene therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The three -- two men and the woman -- suffer from a form of Leber's congenital amaurosis, an otherwise-untreatable condition that robs infants and children of most of their vision.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiment was one of several attempts by various research teams to fix genetic problems by injecting properly functioning DNA into a virus and using the virus to deliver the healthy DNA to individual cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months after doctors injected three patients in the eye with healthy versions of the gene, all of them could detect dim lights they were unable to see before the treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the case of the woman, she uses her right eye -- initially her worst -- to read the dashboard clock in her parents' car. The researchers found that she was seeing the light using a portion of the eye that had been injected with the healthy DNA, and not the usual spot used for reading and seeing detail.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tiny synthetic particles carrying a payload of toxin worked as well as chemotherapy at killing ovarian cancer cells in mice, without the bad side-effects, U. S. researchers said on Thursday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said the treatment, which relies on the use of nanotechnology to deliver genetic material into cells, could be ready for human clinical trials in as little as a year.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What we did was deliver DNA that basically tells cells to die. But it is only turned on in ovarian cells," said Dan Anderson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who worked on the study published in the journal Cancer Research.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study highlights the potential of nanotechnology--the design and manipulation of tiny synthetic particles -- as a non-viral way of getting DNA into cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People have had interesting success with viruses, but viruses have been fraught with certain safety problems," Anderson said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His team's solution was to create an "artificial virus"--a biodegradable polymer that can get inside the cell and be absorbed by the body, in much the same way biodegradable sutures work.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We think that has got a variety of advantages--in particular, safety," said Anderson, who worked with a team at the Lankenau Institute in Pennsylvania. "In this case, we show they have potential as therapeutics for ovarian cancer."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team tested different compounds until they found a biodegradable polymer that would make a suitable delivery vehicle.</p>

</div><div class="author">RICHARD INGHAM   </div><div>AFP</div>
<div>353 words</div><div>16 February 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The world's largest experiment using gene therapy to combat the AIDS virus has yielded "a major advance," demonstrating that the technique is both beneficial and safe, scientists said yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Data from an advanced phase of the test process confirm that the quest to use transplanted genes to roll back the human immunodeficiency virus is valid, they said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors led by Ronald Mitsuyasu of the University of California in Los Angeles</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">recruited 74 HIV-infected volunteers for the experiment, whose results are reported online by the journal Nature Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Half the group were given blood stem cells that had been infiltrated by a crippled virus containing a key gene, while the other were given a harmless lookalike substance.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gene encodes something called an RNA enzyme, or ribozyme for short - a small molecule that, like a spanner thrown into a machine, is intended to block HIV from replicating once it infects a cell.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stemcells are progenitor cells, which means that when they replicate, future generations of those cells will carry the same genetic code.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The goal was to see whether these novel stem cells, by being shielded from HIV thanks to the ribozyme, would survive the body's immune defences and whether HIV, denied a haven for reproduction, would retreat.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Forty-eight weeks after the so-called OZ1 experiment began, there was no statistical difference between those who had received the gene and those who were given the placebo.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But at the 100-week mark, there was encouraging news: In the gene group, the viral count was significantly lower. And the count of CD4 cells - immune cells that are depleted by HIV - was higher.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">None of the gene group experienced any adverse reaction to the therapy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment "is safe and has efficacy, albeit modest," the study says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It shows the potential of the gene therapy approach for the treatment of HIV and represents a major advance in the field ... (it) can be developed as a conventional therapeutic product."</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dagmar Jamieson dreams of the day when she may see her son face clearly. Legally blind and diagnosed with Stargardt macular dystrophy, also known as Stargardt's Disease, her central vision is obscured.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's like someone put Vaseline in the middle of the lenses on my glasses," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More than two million Canadians suffer from some form of visual impairment. Stargardt's Disease is an inherited eye disorder that causes the loss of central vision and affects people in their pre-teen or teen years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jamieson first noticed that something was wrong when she started Grade 5.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She had trouble seeing the blackboard and the teacher's face. Things slowly eroded from that point on and, after countless tests, she was declared legally blind.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was a shocking experience and no one in my family knew how to deal with it," she says. "I was a young individual heading into my teenage years and it was somewhat devastating. I struggled with admitting I was blind for many years."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now married with a 10-year-old son named Alex, Jamieson finds creative ways of coping.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Because I have peripheral vision, I can walk around quite well. I love to entertain and cook, and some of my friends don't even know that I can't see."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Voice-activated and specialized technology also helps her live a relatively normal life, although some common situations can be very difficult.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I force myself to walk into rooms (at social functions) where I don't know anyone. It can be very intimidating because I can't recognize faces. However, things usually have a way of working out," she says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When Alex was young and we were in a room full of people, he would come up and pat me on the leg so that I knew he was there."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Jamieson has adapted and adjusted to her blindness, she knows that she is missing out.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thanks to recent medical research developments, she now has hope that someday she may actually see Alex's smile. Recent gene therapy clinical trials in the U.S. and United Kingdom have shown that gene therapy may help treat inherited blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She says, "I believe that one therapy or breakthrough will open doors for others. I can't even begin to express what it would mean to me if I could see. It would absolutely make a difference in my life and in the lives of people around me."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bill Stell, professor at the University of Calgary faculty of medicine and director of research for the Foundation Fighting Blindness explains how this treatment works.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gene therapy is simply a way of treating disease by introducing new genes into diseased tissue so that the product of the new gene combats the disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most commonly, the treatment is for a 'loss-of-function' or genetically recessive function. That is, a gene that provides an essential function has been damaged, so its function has to be replaced.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This is what was done in the recent trials for gene therapy of LCA (Leber Congenital Amaurosis)."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are many people who are still buried under the depressing outcome of vision loss," says Jamieson. "However, these new studies are raising hope for treatment. Blindness is associated with a white cane and it's so much more than that. It's very surprising to know how many people are suffering from vision loss in one sense or another."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Dr. Stell and Jamieson are optimistic that more clinical trials and research will bring great progress in treating Stargardt's Disease and other visual impairments, the reality is that research is expensive.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To that end, the Foundation Fighting Blindness is hosting a special fundraising event called IN/Sight -- Dining in the Dark on Oct. 2 at the Hotel Arts.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The evening promises to be a feast of the senses that invites patrons to enjoy some of the evening blindfolded. The dinner includes a gourmet menu, paired with a specialty wine list overseen by wine critic Geoff Last from Bin 905.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A highlight promises to be the premiere of Fade to Light written and directed by Calgary's award-wining playwright and Calgary Herald columnist Eugene Stickland. Heard entirely in the dark, it is a poetic meditation on the nature of vision featuring two voices, male and female, as well as a piano.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Without sight, your other senses are heightened," Jamieson says. "People will be wearing blindfolds throughout dinner and the play. There are restaurants around the world that have been using this concept of enjoying food blindfolded. You become a lot of more aware and in tune with the experience. You are forced to slow down, enjoy the food and miraculously, no one spills!"</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IN/Sight -- Dining in the Dark takes place on the eve of the 2008 Alberta Vision Science Symposium and many renowned scientists will be in attendance at the event.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Money raised will stay in Western Canada and fund the Stargardt Project headed up by Dr. Bob Molday at the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This research not only provides the evidence on which future therapy for Stargardt-like disorders will be based, sparing teens from the devastating consequences of early-onset, progressive blindness.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But it also will provide invaluable information and experience that will accelerate the development of gene therapies for other disorders," Stell says.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Jamieson and others like her, it will be an evening full of hope and light.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MINNEAPOLIS</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">MINNEAPOLIS - Batman has always been a hero to Anna and Eric Baker. Not the comic book variety, but a furry, 38-pound, bat-eared one who patiently lets their toddler climb all over him.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, if all goes well, he may also become a hero for the thousands of people -- and tens of thousands of dogs -- who each year have brain tumours diagnosed that are equally fatal in both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Earlier this month, Batman was the first patient to get an experimental therapy that researchers at the University of Minnesota hope will cure his brain cancer. If it works for Batman and other dogs, they say, it holds enormous promise as an effective treatment for people, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Batman has joined a relatively new field of research called comparative oncology, in which researchers leverage what they learn from pets for both animals and people. Advances in molecular and genetic testing show that many diseases in animals don't just look the same in humans, they are the same, said Dr. Jaime Modiano, professor of comparative oncology at the university's veterinary school.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The approach is gaining momentum because testing experimental treatments in animals is also a lot faster and easier than testing them in people. There is no federal regulatory approval process, for one. Since dogs and most other animals don't live as long as humans, both their diseases and treatments progress or fail seven to 10 times faster.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That means the Bakers will know within three to seven months, rather than years, whether Tuesday's surgery and the experimental treatment will prevent Batman's cancer from returning.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The price is right, too. Because it's part of a federally funded cancer research trial, the Bakers are spared a $6,000 to $9,000 vet bill for surgery and painful radiation that might have done their dog as much harm as good.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He was always the most popular member of our family," said Eric Baker, 45. "Now he's the most popular and the most famous."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And the one with the best medical care," added Baker's wife, Anna, 37.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She and her husband, who live in Minneapolis, found him while they were graduate students in Berlin in 1999. They threw a party. Two hundred people and one bat-eared dog showed up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He is 10 years old now. Two weeks ago, he had a seizure. In a matter of days, he had two more. A university vet said he might be fine. Or he might have a brain tumour. Only a $1,400 MRI could tell them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They faced the dilemma that many pet owners confront. Should they spend thousands for diagnostic testing and treatment that might -- or might not -- extend his life a little, but could also make him miserable? Eric Baker is out of work and their debts are piling up.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Should I let my dog die because I didn't have the money," Anna said. It might be different if Batman was near the end of his life, but he was still lively. "I could no more do that to him than I could for a person," she said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then they got a call from Dr. Elizabeth Pluhar, a veterinary neurological surgeon at the university. She had a proposal. If he had a tumour, Batman could be the first of 50 dogs they hope to enrol as part of a research trial to test a combination of gene therapy and vaccine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both are experimental treatments for human types of cancer, but so far neither has proven to work especially well.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Just across town, Dr. John Trusheim is experimenting with a cancer vaccine in people with brain tumours. By coincidence, the first Minnesota patient got his first injection just last week, said Trusheim, a brain-cancer specialist at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While vaccines have had limited success on other types of cancer, scientists are eager to try it with brain cancer, Trusheim said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're up against a tumour that has just a miserable prognosis," Trusheim said. Such tumours kill 13,000 people a year and are the leading cause of cancer deaths in children.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early studies of the human vaccine, called DCVax, showed it slowed tumour progression by several months, he said. But the results of this study, which will involve hundreds of patients nationwide, won't be known for at least two years.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Ohlfest, head of the neurosurgery gene therapy program at the university's Masonic Cancer Centre, is combining a vaccine with what is known as gene therapy. After surgically removing the tumour, the remaining cancer cells are triggered into producing a protein that makes them visible to the body's immune system. A vaccine made from dead brain-tumour cells directs the body's immune system to attack and destroy new tumour cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both he and Trusheim say it's the first time a combination therapy has been tried beyond mice, where it has cured them three-fourths of the time, which Ohlfest said is remarkable success.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It may take a decade or more to win approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to try the combination therapy in people, Ohlfest said.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">OTTAWA</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By giving animals healthy food, a neuroscientist from Boston found, you can teach an old rat new tricks.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And Jim Joseph of Tufts University learned much more: Fresh fruits and vegetables gave animals healthier hearts and blood vessels, healthier muscles, less cancer and less diabetes compared to meats, bread, pasta, cheese and other foods heavy in protein and energy.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Joseph and Dan Nadeau, an endocrinologist in Maine who also teaches at Tufts, near Boston, have packaged their knowledge of food into a book that's two-thirds research written for lay readers and one-third recipes.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In The Color Code, they argue the same chemicals that make fruits and vegetables rich in colour - red berries, green spinach, orange carrots - are the ones we need to protect our cells, and our DNA itself.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But no pills, please: The two authors also say scientists don't do an apple any favours by sucking one chemical out of it, ignoring a dozen others, and packaging just that one in a "supplement" tablet. A beta-carotene pill isn't a carrot.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the USDA Human Nutrition Research Centre on Aging, which is located at Tufts, Joseph wanted to test whether antioxidants would help their memory.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It turned out 20 older rats - similar to people aged 65 to 70 - fed a six-week diet rich in spinach, strawberries and blueberries had far better memories than their neighbours served ordinary rat food, little beige pellets of protein, fat, vitamins and carbohydrate.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They kept their balance better, too.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They started to act like younger animals. That's the revolutionary thing," Nadeau recalled in an interview.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And he says early results from a small human study of 16 volunteers indicate that elderly people who suffer some memory loss, but not dementia, also develop better memories with a daily addition of blueberry juice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That was just one experiment, but the authors collected a variety of studies that point to a central theme: When eaten, the dark-coloured chemicals that protect a plant from ultraviolet light also protect our own cells.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The result is cells that resist DNA damage, which is the starting point for cancers. Protected cells also resist inflammation, said Nadeau. And a flood of research shows that inflammation leads eventually to a variety of diseases, from cancer to damaged blood vessels and heart disease.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The idea is that you can use these powerful antioxidants in foods and prevent disease in a way that is totally non-toxic," he said.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canada Food Guide preaches the same message, in a shorter form: It recommends eating deep-coloured fruits and vegetables every day.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These foods are also low in calories.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you fill your diet with these foods, you're often taking out a lot of bad foods," said Nadeau, who treats a lot of people who are obese, diabetic, or both.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, research has not gone as far as the doctor would like.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"People who grow berries - they don't have the $1 billion to do major studies."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many studies run on grants of $5,000 from a government branch or $10,000 from a growers' association.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among others, Nadeau cites some blueberry research from Agriculture Canada.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The lack of research frustrates Nadeau. Why, he asks, does gene research get all the big bucks?</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that if you eat the right foods, you're actually performing gene therapy very inexpensively."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An example: lay out a typical lab array of human genes. Spread green tea extract over them.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"All the genes you want turned on are turned on, and all those you want turned off are turned off. Same effect with blueberries, and I expect you could do it with Concord grapes as well," said Nadeau.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also wonders whether some brain disorders might be the result of bad eating habits. A diet of cola and fried chicken and french fries doesn't give the body the chemicals it needs to build a healthy brain.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These (junk foods) aren't even really foods. They're food-like substances. "It seems to me the people who eat the best are the ones who eat a lot of fruits and vegetables and take the crap out of their diet."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- - -</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mealtime biochemistry</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Many fruits contain four or five types of anthocyanins, a group of antioxidant chemicals.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Wild blueberries have 25 to 30 types, and also have anti-inflammatory and cancer-fighting chemicals. The anthocyanins are what make the berries blue, and large amounts are also present in Concord grapes and grape juice.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- The stuff that makes curry yellow is curcumin, found in turmeric. It's a major cancer fighter, but also a natural COX-2 inhibitor. That means it turns off the COX-2 gene, which makes inflammatory chemicals. Other COX-2 inhibitors include the drugs Vioxx and Celebrex.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- Beta-carotene was suspected of fighting cancer, until a test found large amounts of the chemical actually led to an increase in cancer rates.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- "In excessive doses, virtually all antioxidants can behave as pro-oxidants," actually promoting the attack on cells by oxygen compounds.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- Gene therapy for a rare type of inherited blindness has improved the vision of four patients who tried it, boosting hopes for the troubled field of gene repair technology, scientists said Sunday. Two separate teams of doctors reported successes in using gene therapy to treat Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Hundreds of thousands of people with failing eyesight have been given fresh hope of a cure after gene therapy techniques were used to treat a teenager.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment transformed the life of a visually impaired 18-year-old. Healthy genes were injected into one eye, leading to a significant improvement.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique could be ready for use within two years to treat people suffering from some inherited diseases of the retina.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within five years it could be ready for testing on people who suffer age-related macular degeneration.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the trial carried out by a team at the University College of London and Moorfields Eye Hospital, the world's first gene transplant for blindness produced an unprecedented improvement in Steven Howarth's sight.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The student suffered from a genetic mutation called Leber's congenital amaurosis, which usually begins affecting sight in early childhood and eventually causes total blindness during a patient's 20s or 30s.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Born with no peripheral or night vision, Howarth noticed an improvement after the two-hour operation. "Now, my sight when it's getting dark or it's badly lit is definitely better," he says. "It's a small change -- but it makes a big difference."</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctors injected genes only into Howarth's worse affected eye and used the lowest dose in what was strictly a safety trial.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Robin Ali, head of the research team, said he believes this is a proof of principle for treating a vast range of blinding conditions, from 100 other inherited kinds to the most common of all, age-related macular degeneration.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy for a rare type of inherited blindness has improved the vision of four patients who tried it, boosting hopes for the troubled field of gene repair technology, scientists said yesterday.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two separate teams of doctors reported successes in using gene therapy to treat Leber congenital amaurosis, or LCA.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LCA damages light receptors in the retina. It usually begins affecting sight in early childhood and causes total blindness by the time a patient is 30. There is no treatment.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both teams used a common cold virus to deliver a normal version of one damaged gene that causes the disease, called RPE65, directly into the eyes of patients.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although both trials were only testing for safety, patients reported they could see a little better afterwards, the researchers told a meeting of eye specialists in Florida and also reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Katherine High of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and colleagues said all three of their volunteers had improved vision after the treatments.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Robin Ali of University College London and colleagues said one of their three volunteers got better.</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because the patients were adults, already had severe sight loss and received only low doses of treatment, researchers had not expected to see a benefit at all.</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CHICAGO -An experimental gene therapy treatment for chronic pain enabled rats with this condition to go symptom-free for three months, a study released yesterday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences said. The rats were injected with a gene that tricks the body into releasing endorphins, a natural painkiller, in the nerve cells surrounding the spinal cord. Researchers are hopeful that the therapy could potentially be used to treat people with severe or chronic pain, sparing them some of the debilitating side effects of the opioid drugs currently on the market that act systemically, rather than locally.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS - Doctors have for the first time successfully used gene therapy to treat children with a rare disease of the nervous system that gained worldwide recognition thanks to the Hollywood movie Lorenzo's Oil, a European health group said Monday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The European Association for Leukodystrophy (ELA) said the breakthrough was unveiled by French researchers at a congress in Rotterdam of the European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The therapy targeted faulty genes that cause adrenoloeuko- dystrophy (ALD), one of a group of inherited disorders known as leukodystrophies in which the myelin sheath protecting nerve cells in the brain becomes damaged.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disease, transmitted through the mother, affects boys, initially affecting their speech, co-ordination and socializing, and leads to progressive dementia and death.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A team led by Patrick Aubourg, a professor at the Saint Vincent de Paul Hospital in Paris, used a harmless version of the AIDS virus as a Trojan horse, introducing the corrected gene to fix the flawed chromosome in bone marrow taken from the children.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bone marrow was then reinjected into the patients.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ALD occurs because a flawed gene on the child's X chromosome does not produce a key enzyme to break down an accumulation of so-called very long chain fatty acids in the brain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months after the therapy, the results have been encouraging, showing a pickup in production of this enzyme, ELA said.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 36-year-old Illinois woman who died last month after being treated with an experimental gene therapy was infected with a fungus that usually causes only a mild illness. But the infection spun out of control and ravaged her organs, suggesting that her immune system was seriously impaired, said a doctor who is part of the medical investigation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman's body was also teeming with a cold-sore virus that the body normally keeps in check, another indication of a faltering immune system. And because of a tear inside her abdomen -- perhaps caused by infection, perhaps by injury -- she had an internal blood clot the size of a watermelon.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">No formal cause of death has been declared for Jolee Mohr, who died July 24. Mohr had been generally healthy until July 2, when trillions of genetically engineered viruses were injected into her right knee in an experimental treatment for her rheumatoid arthritis.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The injected viruses were genetically modified so they would suppress the immune system -- which is responsible for the inflammation of rheumatoid arthritis -- only in her knee. Doctors hope that tests on tissue specimens and blood samples will tell whether the treatment's effects somehow spread from the joint to other parts of Mohr's body.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The picture will be complicated, however, because Mohr was also taking conventional immune-suppressing drugs for her arthritis. One of those in particular, adalimumab, whose brand name is Humira, is known to make patients susceptible to histoplasmosis, the kind of fungal infection that Mohr had. Inexplicably, Mohr suddenly became ill in July, even though she had been taking that drug for years and the fungus that causes histoplasmosis is ubiquitous in the area where she lived.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The company behind the medical experiment,  <span class="companylink">Targeted Genetics</span> of Seattle, has said the treatment has an excellent safety record and that none of the more than 100 other volunteers who got the injections suffered anything more than short-lived side effects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The fungus found throughout Mohr's body is Histoplasma capsulatum. It is common in airborne dust and bird droppings in the Mississippi and Ohio river valleys and generally causes a mild respiratory illness when inhaled. But in people whose immune systems are compromised -- because of AIDS or cancer chemotherapy, for example -- the fungal cells can spread to other organs and blossom quickly into fatal infections.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was in her liver. In the blood. It was essentially everywhere," Hogarth said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Experts in gene therapy are eagerly awaiting the test results. A link to the death would be a painful setback for the research field, which attempts to treat diseases by giving people new genes.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gene therapy holds a great deal of potential," said Arthur Nienhuis of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, who is president of the American Society of Gene Therapy. He noted that after more than a decade of failures and a handful of instances in which gene-based treatments caused leukemia in volunteers, the approach has recently produced what appear to be its first cures.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS - The first attempt at gene therapy against Parkinson's disease has yielded promising results -- and is safe, according to early data from a ground-breaking experiment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The pilot study, conducted among 11 men and one woman in New York, marks the first-ever use of a "Trojan horse" technique against the tragic disease.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It involves taking a gene and tucking it inside a disabled cold virus, which is then injected into a key area of the brain. The harmless virus "infects" the local cells and thus stealthily delivers the corrective piece of genetic code.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12 volunteers, all of whom have advanced Parkinson's, showed significant improvement in trembling, jerkiness and other symptoms, and none had any side-effects, according to an assessment carried out a year after the operation.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The paper, appearing Saturday in the British journal The Lancet, could be an important spur for gene therapy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the 1990s, the dramatic rise of biotechnology spurred hopes of a new dawn for medicine in which inherited diseases could be wiped out by replacing the faulty genes in targeted cells with the right ones.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This bright vision darkened as scientists realized that substituting one gene with another can have far-reaching consequences elsewhere.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In 1999, an 18-year-old American volunteer, Jesse Gelsinger, died after his immune system ran amok following a gene transplant to fix a liver enzyme deficiency.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in 2002, French researchers were stunned when three out of 10 children they had cured with corrective genes to fix an inherited immunodeficiency disorder, suddenly developed leukemia.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In this climate of deep prudence, researchers led by Matthew During, a professor at Cornell University's Weill Medical College, were placed under tight constraints in their experiment, which aimed primarily at testing for safety.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parkinson's is an incurable, degenerative disease of the central nervous system that causes uncontrollable shaking, along with impaired speech and movement. In approximately one third of cases it also results in dementia. The disease affects at least one per cent of people over the age of 65.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cause is a loss of dopamine, a chemical messenger that helps direct movement. Attempts to treat Parkinson's have focussed essentially on providing a pharmaceutical substitute for dopamine or on restoring or protecting dopamine-producing cells.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During's team aimed at part of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus, which becomes hyperactive as a result of Parkinson's and blocks signals to the nervous system, hampering motor control.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner to pinpoint their operations, the team delicately delivered a gene that controls the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) into the volunteers' subthalamic nucleus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea was to use the gene as a switch to reverse the subthalamic nucleus's activity, turning it into an inhibitor rather than exciter of motor output signals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within three months of the operation patients reported substantial improvements, and the improvement continued until 12 months, the endpoint of the trial.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers say the results, while preliminary, are encouraging, especially as U.S. health watchdogs only gave them cautious authorization for a gene transplant on one side of the brain, not both.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON - In a major breakthrough in gene therapy, the technique has been used for the first time to successfully treat a degenerative brain disease.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a pioneering U.S. study, researchers used the treatment to bring about significant improvements in the mobility of Parkinson's sufferers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They said it could also herald a breakthrough in the treatment of other neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer's or epilepsy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12 patients involved in the study -- a world-first human gene therapy trial for a brain disease -- all reported a substantial reduction in their symptoms after having a human gene injected directly into their brains.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Within months, their ability to move had improved on average by 30 per cent. Some reported a 65-per-cent improvement in their mobility.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nathan Klein, 59, the first to undergo the pioneering treatment told the Daily Telegraph that before the gene therapy, he had been "in a state that nobody could survive."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said: "The treatment saved my life."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prof. Matthew During, one of the lead researchers, said: "Klein has further improved, I saw him just a week ago and he looked great, further improved since I had last seen him 18 months ago."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parkinson's robs sufferers of the ability to walk and even eat, causes long motionless periods known as "freezing" as well as head and limb tremors.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As the disease progresses, higher doses of drugs are required, leading to side-effects that include involuntary movements.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sufferers include the former world boxing champion Muhammad Ali and the actor Michael J. Fox.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">STUDY SUBJECTS GIVEN INJECTIONS   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research team lead by Dr. Michael Kaplitt said: "We believe this is a milestone -- not only for the treatment of Parkinson's disease, but for the use of gene-based therapies against neurological conditions generally."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Kieran Breen, the director of research and development for the U.K. Parkinson's Disease Society, said: "There are many potential ways to treat or cure Parkinson's, and gene therapy is one potential route holding a lot of promise.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The results of the study are encouraging in terms of safety and efficacy and we look forward to seeing the results of the larger trial planned for later this year."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The research team, from the New York-Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center and the New Jersey-based company Neurologix, report their findings in Friday's edition of Lancet.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parkinson's occurs when the brain cells -- neurons -- that release the messenger chemical known as dopamine die. Protein deposits also form in the brain, and levels of another messenger chemical called GABA -- which calms overexcited brain cells -- drop.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The study, begun in 2003, was carried out on 11 men and one woman with an average age of 58, who had all had severe Parkinson's for at least five years and for whom current therapies were no longer effective.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They were given injections of billions of copies of a genetically altered virus into part of the brain called the subthalamic nucleus.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The altered virus carried the human gene for an enzyme, called GAD, which helps to make GABA. Once implanted, the brain cells of the patients started to make the GABA chemical, said During.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To show that the treatment was truly having an effect, the doctors injected the virus into the subthalamic nucleus of each of the 12 Parkinson's patients, but only on one side of their brains. One reason for this was out of concern for the patients' safety, after high-profile deaths caused by gene therapy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months after the injections, the patients had shown up to 30-per-cent improvement in movement which lasted over the full year of the study. Several patients showed improvements of up to 65 per cent.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As predicted, the improvements were seen in the side of the body controlled by the brain hemisphere that had received the treatment.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">There were also strong trends toward reductions in movement difficulties linked to drugs and improved daily living.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Will these remarkable improvements persist? Only longer follow-up can tell, but prior studies in animals, including primates, suggest that the transplanted gene does stay active for years," Kaplitt said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This breakthrough trial has implications that go far beyond Parkinson's research. It's taken us nearly two decades of hard work to get here, but the success of this trial lays the foundation for the use of gene therapy against neurological diseases generally."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">RESEARCHERS PLAN LARGER STUDY   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers are planning a larger Phase 2 study in Parkinson's disease this year and a preliminary trial with epilepsy sufferers.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This ground-breaking study represents not only an encouraging first step in the development of a promising new approach to Parkinson's disease therapy, but also provides a platform to translate a variety of new gene therapy agents into human clinical trials for many devastating brain disorders," said Paul Greengard, chairman of the Neurologix Scientific Advisory Board and a Nobel prize winner.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alan Kingsman of  <span class="companylink">Oxford Biomedica</span>, who is on the verge of testing his own gene therapy treatment for Parkinson's by the end of the year, also lauded the results. "This is very good news for the field of gene therapy for neurological disorders," Kingsman said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It represents the first of a number of gene-based products that will bring increasing benefit to patients with devastating diseases such as Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, in an accompanying comment in Lancet, Dr. Jon Stoessl, of the Pacific Parkinson's Research Centre at the University of British Columbia, sounded a note of caution.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He questioned the advantages of gene therapy over deep-brain stimulation, a current method for treating Parkinson's disease by implanting ultra fine electrodes to stimulate the brain.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"During and colleagues ... should be congratulated," he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They made an important step in showing proof of principle, but much work should be done before neurologists and neuroscientists will regard this therapy as an effective approach."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">During's laboratory grew copies of the human gene used in the therapy in bacteria from DNA isolated from a human sample, a standard method whereby the gene multiplies along with the bacteria.   </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON - A gene therapy treatment that helped make cells more sensitive to the body's own painkillers not only helped ease arthritis pain in mice but also reduced other symptoms, researchers said Friday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers are now trying to get permission to try the treatment in people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This therapy can simply be injected anywhere in an injured joint, and the treatment will find the nerve endings," said Dr. Stephanos Kyrkanides of the University of  <span class="companylink">Rochester Medical</span> Center in New York, who led the study.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers used a well-tested method of gene therapy, employing a virus called an adeno-associated virus to carry a new gene into the body. In this case, the new gene was one called the human mu-opioid receptor -- a kind of molecular doorway that the body's natural painkillers use to get into cells.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The more of them a cell has, the more sensitive it is to these painkilling chemicals.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Kyrkanides team had mice genetically engineered to develop osteoarthritis in the same way that people do. They injected their gene-engineered virus into various joints.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"That strategy not only significantly reduced the pain behaviour in the mice with arthritis, but it also helped to minimize the arthritis pathology itself," Kyrkanides said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This suggests that the pain receptors play a role not only in the pain but also in the joint damage caused by arthritis, he said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Osteoarthritis affects close to 10 per cent of men over the age of 60 and 18 per cent of women over 60 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. Aspirin-type analgesics can help, but they have often-deadly side-effects.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">SHOULD WORK ON HUMANS   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Kyrkanides said he believes his gene therapy system would work in people, as all mammals have the same opiate receptor system.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We used the actual human gene in our therapy," he said. "I am certain that if the human gene had a therapeutic effect in mice, it will certainly have it in humans as well."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy has a mixed record. The idea is to replace faulty genes, or to amplify the effects of genes that people already have.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But many experiments have failed to show lasting effects in people.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In addition, one 18-year-old gene therapy volunteer was killed by an immune reaction to the virus that carried the gene.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A world-renowned U.S. geneticist known as the "father of gene therapy" was jailed for 14 years by a court in Los Angeles yesterday for molesting a girl during martial arts lessons.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">William French Anderson, 70, whose work in the field of genetics has received global acclaim, was convicted last July of sexually abusing a girl under 14 as well as three counts of lewd and lascivious acts with a child.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson, a runner-up for Time magazine's prestigious Man of the Year award in 1994, was accused of sexually abusing the victim, who is now in her adulthood, over a period of several years beginning when she was 9 or 10.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They met when the girl and her family moved to California from China and her mother began working for Anderson at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine, where he was director of Gene Therapy Laboratories.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Prosecutors alleged Anderson molested the girl while he taught karate to her, and accused him of performing "medical exams" on her while she was naked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was not just a mentor/mentee relationship, not just a father/daughter relationship ... there was the secret dirty side to that relationship," said Deputy District Attorney Cathryn Brougham.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anderson's defence lawyers claimed the girl's family were trying to extort Anderson by alleging abuse when in fact, they argued, Anderson was guilty only of pressuring the child to do well in school.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a tape-recorded conversation played to jurors during last year's month-long trial, the girl is heard confronting Anderson about the sex abuse. Anderson tells the girl: "I just did it, just something in me was just evil."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Asked in court about his response, Anderson said he thought she was referring to the emotional abuse he'd inflicted on her. "Pressuring her, causing her to crash, ruining her life, that was evil," he said.  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The future for gene therapy -- the insertion of specific engineered genes into a patient's cells or tissues to treat a disease -- is looking brighter today than it has in a very long time. U.S. researchers are reporting that two male patients with advanced forms of deadly skin cancer had their cancers eliminated after they were treated with genetically altered versions of their own immune cells. By doctors' estimates, both men had only three to six months to live before taking part in the gene therapy experiment. They have now been cancer-free for more than a year-and-a-half.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In short, researcher Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the U.S. National Cancer Institute and his colleagues have achieved a significant first: curing human cancer with modified genes. The success was not an unqualified one. Dr. Rosenberg and his team used gene therapy on 17 melanoma patients in total. For 15 of these individuals, the therapy was ineffective, apparently in large part because the super-charged immune cells did not remain in their bodies as long as they remained in the bodies of the two men who were cured.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the signs are promising. Until recently, gene therapy was considered very risky because it has caused leukemia in several cases where it was was used to treat patients with a disease of the immune system called X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (XSCID). (These patients did develop full immune systems thanks to the gene therapy, but they later suffered the deadly blood cancer.) The sobering results led to the medical community taking a very cautious attitude toward the experimental therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">However, new U.S. research from St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital has shown that mice mimicking XSCID patients are unusually susceptible to cancer as a result of gene therapy, implying that the therapy does not pose the same risk for people with other diseases. Also encouraging is new research from the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, which shows that gene therapy is effective in treating ovarian cancer in mice. Finally, researchers at the same institution have successfully used gene therapy to speed up the healing of damaged skeletal muscle in mice.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are warning that it will be a long time before these and other small triumphs translate into the widespread use of gene therapy to cure human disease. And they are right to proceed with caution: Clearly animal models will never perfectly predict a treatment's effect on humans, and curing two out of 17 patients, while better than nothing, is not a great percentage. But the technology is obviously steadily advancing, and with it the potential for life-saving treatments for a wide array of currently incurable diseases.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TORONTO - U.S. researchers have genetically engineered immune cells in the blood, transforming them into tumour fighters that eliminated melanoma in two men with an advanced stage of the often deadly disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While 15 other patients with melanoma were not helped by the modified T-cell treatment, its success in the two who responded was hailed Thursday as a significant step forward in the field of gene therapy for cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Principal researcher Dr. Steven Rosenberg of the National Cancer Institute said his research team hopes to expand clinical trials of the gene therapy for patients with other types of advanced malignancies, including breast and colon cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It represents the first time that we've been able to do gene therapy . . . and treat cancer patients, to genetically engineer human cells and cause cancer regression," Rosenberg, the NCI's head of surgery, said Thursday from Bethesda., Md. "So we're very enthusiastic about it as a new approach."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the therapy "had no impact" on the other 15, who have since died, Rosenberg said his team has found a way to strengthen the genetically engineered T-cells in the hope of improving the success rate among other patients with advanced melanoma.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have receptors, that is genes, that are 10 to 100 times more powerful than the ones we used just a couple of years ago, so I have every expectation that we're going to be able to improve upon this dramatically."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brad Nelson, director of the B.C. Cancer Agency's Deeley Research Centre in Victoria, said that although the clinical trial was small, its results represent "a really important step forward."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Where this is an advance is it might allow an off-the-shelf approach . . . and for any patient you could take a blood sample from them and genetically engineer any old T-cell in their blood sample and it could now become a tumour killer," said Nelson, who specializes in adaptive T-cell therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This will be a boost for the gene therapy field, which has had some setbacks."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Rosenberg's lab took normal T-cells that don't recognize cancer from the melanoma patients, who had run out of treatment options. The researchers altered the T-cells so a receptor protein carried on their surface would recognize molecules called antigens on the tumour cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">These newly armed T-cells were grown in the lab, then injected into the patient's bloodstream, much like a transfusion. In 15 of the 17 patients who received the therapy, the fortified T-cells remained in the body, but grew at low levels over a few months. The 15 eventually succumbed to the melanoma.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only two saw their cancer disappear. They are currently disease-free and their super-T-cell levels remain high two years after treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm cured for now," said one of the two, Mark Origer, 53, of Watertown, Wis., who saw his tumours start to shrink just a month after his December 2004 treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Origer told The Daily Telegraph how, after five years of losing the battle with the disease, he was made well enough to attend his daughter's wedding last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She wanted me to be there for her, and she wanted me to be there for me," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A year ago, only a small cancerous spot on his liver remained, which surgeons later removed. A checkup from NCI doctors this week confirmed that Origer is still cancer-free, he told The Associated Press.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I know how fortunate I am to have gone through this and responded to this," he said. "Not everybody's that lucky."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Still, the researchers admit there's no guarantee that the cancer won't come back.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An estimated 4,500 Canadians will be diagnosed this year with malignant melanoma, and almost 900 will die, says the Canadian Cancer Society.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Despite optimism about the experimental treatment's promise, Nelson cautioned that safety of gene therapy remains a concern, since it is T-cells that go awry in autoimmune diseases such as Type 1 diabetes, in which they attack healthy insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nelson said Rosenberg's paper, published Thursday in the journal Science, "doesn't talk much about autoimmunity."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Those T-cells will now become activated by the tumour but they still have their other receptors that they were born with," he said. "So now that they're activated . . . what is stopping that T-cell from going into the pancreas, in diabetes for instance, and starting to destroy the pancreas?"  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LOS ANGELES - Scientists for the first time have genetically modified tumour-fighting immune cells, allowing patients to rid themselves of an aggressive form of cancer, according to a study released yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The technique, used to cure two patients with advanced melanoma, paves the way for a new approach to fighting cancer by harnessing -- and boosting -- the body's immune system, instead of relying on toxic chemotherapy and radiation treatments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers from the National Cancer Institute, whose findings were published online by the journal Science, say the strategy could be adapted to treat breast, prostate, lung, colorectal and other common cancers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's obviously very exciting," said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Steven Rosenberg, chief of the National Cancer Institute's surgery branch and senior author of the study, said the results reaffirm the promise of gene therapy after several high-profile setbacks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been hyping gene therapy for a long time," he said. "This is the first example of where we can actually use it to treat a cancer patient."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosenberg and others cautioned that it would take several years to translate this initial success into a practical therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They added that there is still more failure than success with the technique. Fifteen other melanoma patients enrolled in the study failed to show sustained improvement from the modified immune cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the success with two patients, who are cancer-free more than 18 months after their treatment, was enough to demonstrate the possibility of a new front in the long, intractable war against cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The important thing is this approach worked," said Dr. Margaret Kemeny, director of the Queens Cancer Center in New York. "Can they make this approach work more often? That is the question."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Melanoma accounts for only four per cent of skin cancer cases, but it is the most lethal type.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosenberg had previously discovered that some melanoma patients are able to generate a type of immune cell, called T cells, that recognize the tumour cells as unwanted intruders and respond by attacking them. His research team removed white blood cells from patients with metastatic melanoma and isolated the most aggressive tumour-fighting T cells. Those cells were multiplied in the lab while patients underwent chemotherapy to clear out their own immune systems. Once the slates were clean, patients were injected with concentrated doses of their own most-powerful cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The experiments showed promise, but about half the patients didn't have any T cells that were able to target melanoma, Dr. Rosenberg said. So he decided to give ordinary T cells the genes they would need to become attack cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One patient, 53-year-old Mark Origer, had tried drugs, surgery and an experimental vaccine before enrolling in the gene therapy trial. By the time he had his first checkup about a month after getting the souped-up T cells, his tumours had shrunk in half.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I was euphoric," said Mr. Origer, who was diagnosed with melanoma in 1999.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had waited so many years to find something that was working."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The T cells eradicated the tumour under his arm and shrivelled another tumour in his liver by 89 per cent. He has been cancer-free since the remaining mass was surgically removed in October.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy devised by U.S. scientists has cured two dying men of cancer by using genetically modified versions of their own cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both were suffering from advanced melanoma that had metastasized throughout their bodies when the treatments began, but were pronounced cancer-free 18 months later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The hope is the technique could be customized to attack other common cancers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Although scientists remain cautious because there have been many false dawns in the use of gene therapy, the results show, in principle at least, that aggressive cancer can be treated this way, even after it has spread and the outlook is grim.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success using the patients' genetically modified white blood cells is reported today in the journal Science by a team at the U.S. National Cancer Institute led by Dr. Steven Rosenberg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Both patients are still free of the disease after 18 months," he said. During the study, tumours shrank in other participants, all of whom had exhausted other forms of treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is the first time, with all the hype of gene therapy, we have managed to use genetic engineering to treat cancer patients," Dr. Rosenberg added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mark Origer, 53, a postmaster from Waterdown, Mass., and one of the two patients, said after five years of losing the battle with the disease he was well enough to attend his daughter Katie's wedding last year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"She wanted me to be there for her, and she wanted me to be there for me," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was diagnosed with melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, in 1999 when his wife spotted a small dark mole between his shoulder blades.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A cyst that grew on the same area of his back in 2002 was found to have malignant cells and the cancer continued to spread until, in June 2004, it was found in his liver. He underwent chemical and surgical treatments, but none could stop the cancer spreading.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In December, 2004, he was given the gene therapy and was discharged the same month. By January, 2005, his tumours had shrunk by half and by last September, when he attended his daughter's wedding, one small spot remained in his liver which surgeons removed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last week, doctors said he was completely clear of cancer cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of the 17 patients with advanced skin cancer who underwent gene therapy, the treatment worked only on Mr. Origer and "Thomas M," aged 39, clearing the disease from liver, lymph node and lung.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists believe they can improve the response and adapt it to fight other cancers, notably breast, colon and lung.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These results represent the first time gene therapy has been used successfully to treat cancer," said Dr. Elias Zerhouni, director of NCI's parent agency, the National Institutes of Health. "Moreover, we hope it will be applicable not only to melanoma but also for a broad range of common cancers, such as breast and lung cancer."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment relies on the body's protective immune system, in this case a type of white blood cell, or lymphocyte, called a T cell. Although they attack tumours, these alone are no match for an aggressive cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosenberg created billions of T cells by removing the patients' cells and modifying them so they developed a certain receptor, a protein that helps them to recognize and kill tumours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genetically engineered cells were transfused into 17 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, where the disease had spread. The study shows that the engineered cells can shrink large tumours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosenberg has found a more potent class of receptors, up to 100 times more effective at helping immune cells attack the cancer. His team has also engineered immune cells to attack breast, lung and liver cancers.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists believe they can improve the response and adapt it to fight other cancers, notably breast, colon and lung.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These results represent the first time gene therapy has been used successfully to treat cancer," said Dr. Elias Zerhouni, director of NCI's parent agency, the National Institutes of Health.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Moreover, we hope it will be applicable not only to melanoma but also for a broad range of common cancers, such as breast and lung cancer."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment relies on the body's protective immune system, in this case a type of white blood cell, or lymphocyte, called a T cell. Although they attack tumours, these alone are no match for an aggressive cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosenberg created billions of T cells by removing the patients' cells and modifying them so they developed a certain receptor, a protein that helps them to recognize and kill tumours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genetically engineered cells were transfused into 17 patients with advanced metastatic melanoma, where the disease had spread. The study shows that the engineered cells can shrink large tumours.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Rosenberg has found a more potent class of receptors, up to 100 times more effective at helping immune cells attack the cancer. His team has also engineered immune cells to attack breast, lung and liver cancers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have now expressed other lymphocyte receptors that recognize breast, lung, and other cancers," he said. "They are present on half of all common cancers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We can, with these powerful receptors, convert any patient's normal cells into cells that will recognize these common cancers."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Trials will start within a month, subject to approval by the U.S. authorities, though Dr. Rosenberg did not want to identify which cancer types would be involved.  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stem cells, gene therapy and deep brain electrical stimulation are exciting neurology researchers, but will these innovations turn out to be effective therapies for children with cerebral palsy?   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've been promised gene therapy for the last 20 years and it still hasn't materialized," British pediatric neurologist Peter Baxter said yesterday.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But there's lot of effort and a lot of gifted people really trying to find better ways to help children achieve more," said Baxter, co-chairperson of the panel on advances in cerebral palsy at the 10th International Child Neurology Congress, which runs through Friday in Montreal.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stem-cell growth is often hard to direct or control, he said. But a key line of therapy under investigation involves inserting a reed-thin wire deep into the brain for electrical stimulation. It's been used on adults with Parkinson's disease, he said, but it's not known whether it's effective on young patients with cerebral palsy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Little is known about the causes of cerebral palsy, an umbrella term for a complex condition that affects 15 million children worldwide. The disorder affects two children out of 1,000. The diagnosis of cerebral palsy, using a series of tests, often comes when a child fails to reach a developmental marker. For example, not lifting the head by age 3 months could be an indicator.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Motor disability varies in type and severity and may involve speech and breathing problems, floppiness or spasticity, balance and co-ordination.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most treatment is directed at improving a child's quality of life.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Milivoj Velickovic Perat, of the University Pediatric Hospital in Ljubljana, Slovenia, dismissed the possibility of stem cell therapy for cerebral palsy.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also warned against fake remedies and treatments that "were not proven effective," including biofeedback, acupuncture and the controversial hyperbaric oxygen therapy, which involves entering a sealed chamber and breathing air saturated with a higher percentage of oxygen.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anyone can understand parents' desperate desire to help their child, pediatric neurologist and congress chairperson Michael Shevell said.   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But after a double-blind, placebo-controlled Quebec study published in the Lancet showed "no difference" between a group of children who received a placebo and those getting hyperbaric oxygen, Shevell said, "On a scientific basis, I cannot recommend it."   </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Families affected by cerebral palsy and epilepsy are invited to discuss the disorders with local experts at two public forums, running concurrently, from 3-5 p.m. today at the Hilton Bonaventure Hotel, 900 la Gauchetiere St. W.   </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sheryl Ubelacker TORONTO -- It's one of those questions that has baffled humans for millennia: What came first, the chicken or the egg? For scientists seeking a way to give sight to genetically blind chickens, it was definitely the egg.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers from the University of Florida injected healthy genes through the eggshells of chickens with an inherited disorder that causes them to be born blind. When the treated chicks hatched, not only could they see, but their vision was "amazing," said neuroscientist Sue Semple-Rowland, the principal researcher.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More importantly, the gene-transfer raises high hopes for developing a treatment to restore sight in children with a similar condition, called Leber congenital amaurosis Type 1, or LCA1.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I firmly believe this will work," Semple-Rowland said from Gainesville, Fla. "We're really, really close to making it possible to treat kids with various forms of LCA with gene therapy and have them have a relatively normal life in terms of vision."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While there is much work still to be done, she predicted a treatment for humans could come within just a few years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The breakthrough with the chickens took 20 years of painstaking work by Semple-Rowland and her colleagues to determine what caused the birds' blindness, to isolate the defective gene and then to figure out how to fix it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her lab modified a virus to carry a normal copy of the gene that is defective in the chickens. Of seven chicks injected in-utero, six could see after hatching, said the scientists.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">John Moore rolled into St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto last summer in an electric wheel chair. His ailing  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">heart was so weak he could not walk more than a few steps.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore was checking in for a pioneering gene therapy experiment involving 110 Canadians from Vancouver Island to Quebec City. As part of the experiment, participants either had millions of genes injected into their hearts, or they received placebo, or dummy, treatment as part of the control group. Either way, Moore felt he had nothing to lose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore, 67, says the injections were painless. "You don't even feel it," he says. But the subsequent improvement in his health has been remarkable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A few weeks ago Moore strode back into St. Michael's for his six-month follow-up with a big grin on his face. "I feel great," says Moore, who now walks a couple of kilometres a day and is packing for a two-month vacation in Florida.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He's gone from a cardiac cripple, literally, to leading a normal life," says Dr. Duncan Stewart, director of cardiology at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital, who heads the trial.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore's wife Phyllis is even more animated. "It's like a miracle," she said in an interview from their home in Windsor, Ont., after Moore strapped on his runners and headed to the treadmill for his daily workout.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Under the rules of the blind research trial, the medical team cannot crack its files to see if Moore got the gene injection or the dummy treatment until all 110 patients complete their treatment later this year. Moore may well just be experiencing a dramatic placebo effect, the researchers caution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gene therapy trial is the first of several Canadian projects to use genes, stem cells, and genetically enhanced "super cells" to try to halt and undo the ravages of heart disease, the country's No. 1 killer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stewart's gene therapy trial, the first of its kind in North America, entails injecting multiple copies of a gene directly into damaged heart muscle to stimulate growth of blood vessels. The genes, produced in bacteria and wrapped in biological packets known as plasmids, are injected into the heart muscle through a catheter. The idea is that the genes will migrate into the cells, turn on and start pumping out the growth factors to stimulate formation of new heart vessels.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are very hopeful this is going to work," says Stewart, who is collaborating with doctors and patients in heart centres in Quebec City, Montreal, Toronto, Edmonton and Victoria.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While Stewart says the project results could "change the whole landscape for gene therapy," he and his colleagues are also exploring other options.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardiologists in Montreal plan to harvest potent stem cells from patients' bone marrow and redirect them to the damaged cardiac tissue to prevent scarring and cell death after heart attacks. Left unchecked, the heart withers after an attack and scars so badly it is unable to pump blood adequately.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're waiting for the green light from Health Canada," says Dr. Samer Mansour, a cardiologist at the Hotel-Dieu Hospital and Universite de Montreal.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even more ambitious projects are in the works at the University of Toronto, where gene and stem cells are morphing into what some of the researchers are calling "super cells".  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cardiac surgeon Dr. Terrence Yau, at Toronto General Hospital, and his team want to deliver close to a billion genetically enhanced cells to patient's scarred heart muscles when they undergo bypass surgery. Yau is hoping to start the project, involving about 75 patients, this year. He says stem cells would be harvested from the patients' bone marrow a few weeks before the operation, loaded up with new genes in the lab and then injected into the heart during surgery.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"One thing that is very clear from the work done with animals is that implanting the right kind of cells can have a dramatic effect on heart pumping function," says Yau.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stewart and his colleagues plan to take a similar tack in treating people who have just had a heart attack. They are designing a project, which will involve about 90 patients, to harvest potent cells from the blood and genetically enhance them in the lab. The cells would then be infused into the heart to try minimize damage to cardiac muscle and stimulate new blood vessel formation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Exactly how stem cells, both the regular and genetic enhanced varieties, work their magic is still poorly understood. There is evidence the cells morph into heart cells. Other experiments indicate they fuse with the damaged and dying heart cells and help keep them alive. The cells may also excrete compounds that stimulate regeneration, says Noiseux.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctors stress the need for collaboration and well-designed, small trials to clarify the mechanisms and come up with effective treatments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Moore, meantime, is ready to sign on for the upcoming experiment with genetically enhanced cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I told him to put my name down for that one too," says Moore. "We got a lot of living to do yet," adds his wife Phyllis.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the key differences with the biotherapies is the tinkering is going on inside the beating hearts of such people as 72-year-old George Morrow of Qualicum Beach on Vancouver Island.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The retired engineer, who worked in the aerospace industry, had a quintuple bypass at age 58. That operation bought Mr. Morrow 10 years, before his arteries clogged up again and heart pains and angina returned with a vengeance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One specialist told Mr. Morrow in 2001 that there nothing more conventional medicine could do for him. "He told me I had 18 months max,'" he recalls.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Being adventurous, altruistic and out of other options, he signed on for the gene therapy experiment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He did not notice much improvement after the injections and cannot walk too far, or too fast. "About a quarter mile and that's about it," he says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In Windsor, Mr. Moore's health followed a similar trajectory.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had a massive heart attack and a triple bypass when he was 43. Twenty years later excruciating chest pains and heart attacks returned. His heart grew so weak he retired from Chrysler, where he was maintenance foreman, and found himself spending most of his time in an electric wheelchair. "I was suffering badly," he says. "I couldn't walk 10 to 15 feet without getting angina."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore says his health turned around after the injections last August. He says he felt noticeably better by the end of September and was soon strolling down the halls in his apartment building, then around the building beside the Detroit River.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore figures he must have received the gene treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Stewart cannot say whether he did but says he was pretty impressed when Mr. Moore walked into the clinic for his final checkup a few weeks ago.

Dr. Stewart cautions the results will not be known for several months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Moore, meantime, is ready to sign on for the upcoming experiment with genetically enhanced cells.  </p>

<div>609 words</div><div>13 December 2005</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A17</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2005 Edmonton Journal  </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON - Mike Castle lay motionless as surgeons drilled two holes into his skull and injected a virus deep into his brain. The virus carries a gene and a tantalizing hope: that just maybe it could stall the Parkinson's disease slowly crippling him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Illinois man is among a few dozen patients enrolling in the first attempts at gene therapy for Parkinson's, a milestone in the quest to better treat the degenerative brain disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's a time of mixed excitement and caution: These first three studies are to see if gene therapy is safe to try, not to prove whether it works. Yet studies in monkeys suggest at least one of the approaches has the potential to finally target the underlying disease, not merely tame its symptoms.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's this delicate balance between giving (patients) hope but making it clear to them, and to the world, that this is still highly experimental," says Dr. William J. Marks Jr. of the University of California, San Francisco, who is leading the most closely-watched approach -- using a nerve growth factor to rescue dying brain cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a gamble," agrees Dr. Leo Verhagen of Chicago's Rush University Medical Center, a co-researcher in the project who treated Castle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first trial that, if it works, could slow down the disease's progression," he explains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet to stress the experiment's unknowns, he bluntly told Castle, "We are happy if we don't make you worse."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Parkinson's disease gradually destroys brain cells that produce dopamine, a chemical crucial for the cellular communication that controls muscle movement. As dopamine levels drop, symptoms increase: tremors in the arms, legs and face; periodically stiff or frozen limbs; slow movement; impaired balance and co-ordination. It afflicts about 1.5 million Americans and approximately 100,000 Canadians.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Standard treatments are to replace lost dopamine with the drug levodopa, and a brain implant to control tremors. Both work for a while, but can't stop the disease's inevitable march.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To do that, scientists have long sought ways to protect remaining dopamine-producing neurons, or nerve cells, and rescue dying ones. A candidate: growth factors, protective proteins naturally found in healthy brains.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the UCSF and Rush study, the brains of 12 patients are being injected with a harmless virus that carries the gene for one growth factor, called neurturin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Neurturin is a sister to the better-known growth factor GDNF, an experimental drug believed to be showing promise against Parkinson's until a study infusing it directly into the brain was halted for safety concerns. Moreover, infusions don't allow the growth factor to spread deep enough to reach Parkinson's most crucial brain region, Verhagen says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists hope gene therapy can get around those issues. Rush neuroscientist Jeffrey Kordower found that monkeys with Parkinson's-like damage significantly improved within three months of receiving growth-factor gene therapy, as injured neurons were rescued.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He co-founded California-based Ceregene Inc., which is developing the neurturin gene therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Gene therapy offers another mechanism in which to get these growth factors into the brain," said Diane Murphy, a neurodegenerative disease specialist at the National Institutes of Health. "That's why people are interested in this, since the infusion methods seem to be problematic."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA - Harvey Harris settled into the bed at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, ready to endure yet another round of tests to check the aggressive cancer growing in his chest.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wasn't feeling optimistic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By most counts, Mr. Harris should have been dead by now. He had mesothelioma, caused by a lifetime spent working around asbestos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six months earlier, after conventional chemotherapy had failed him, Mr. Harris decided to try an experimental treatment. He was infused with hundreds of billions of viral particles genetically engineered to rev up his body to attack the cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then, in July, he ventured even further into unproved territory. He became the first patient in the clinical trial at Penn to get a second dose of the gene drug.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Soon he would have an answer. Had the gene therapy stopped the cancer?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Or was the tumour, which enveloped his right lung like a rind, now advancing, steadily robbing his energy and breath?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris braced for the worst. The day before, he'd had a CAT scan near his Gibbsboro, N.J., home and then held up the film to a skylight in his family room. To his eye, the cancer looked worse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sick as he felt, Mr. Harris, a slight, balding man, was full of plans. He was only 61.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Jeanette, his wife, was throwing him a birthday party in a few days, and for the first time in more than a decade, he and his three grown children would all be together.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As well, for the first time in his life, he had plenty of money.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He was close to dozing off when the nurse appeared at his bedside.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She was holding his CAT scan report, which had just been faxed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris had not expected to know a thing until he met later in the week with Dr. Daniel Sterman, who led the clinical trial.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now, out of the blue, his fate was right in front of him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- - -  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of all the cancers, mesothelioma is among the most merciless.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancer, which attacks the linings of the chest and abdomen, can be hard to detect and often advances rapidly. Patients usually die within eight to 14 months of diagnosis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The cancer is primarily caused by exposure to asbestos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The disease has long been a focus for Dr. Sterman and his team. They began testing gene therapy on the disease 10 years ago with a different drug. The first of 34 patients from that trial is still alive, as are two others.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Back then, the field of gene therapy was hot.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But in 1999, the field nearly imploded when a teenager died in a gene-therapy trial at Penn, then a national leader in the field. Federal investigators ordered a halt to the university's eight trials, including the one for mesothelioma, after the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger. They said patient safety could not be guaranteed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene-therapy trials did not resume at Penn for more than three years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Currently, the university has three trials, including the one for mesothelioma.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- - -  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One February morning in 2004, Mr. Harris was dressing for work when he became so short of breath he could barely walk.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He made it downstairs to the sofa and collapsed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For months he had been feeling winded and tired, but checkups found nothing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On that day, the pressure in his chest was unbearable. His doctor sent him to the hospital.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The diagnosis of mesothelioma baffled him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"What the hell is that?" he asked.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As it was, he had a classic history for the cancer. In the navy, he had chipped asbestos off pipes. Then, he'd worked for nearly 13 years at the Owens-Corning Fiberglas plant in New Jersey, where he routinely handled asbestos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You inhaled the dust constantly," Mr. Harris testified for a lawsuit he brought against asbestos manufacturers.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His longest stretch of employment, about 17 years at the Naval Air Station in Pensacola, Fla., also involved asbestos.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His doctor told him that removing the tumour wasn't an option. He began chemotherapy. His pain was so bad he couldn't sleep. So he cruised the Internet, looking up mesothelioma.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From what he read, he felt he'd be in the ground in six months.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Then he discovered that at a medical centre just across the river, something new was being tried.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ten days before Christmas, he went to see Dr. Sterman.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- - -  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris felt an instant connection with the young doctor. He also sensed Dr. Sterman's passion as he talked about his team's research.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Penn is testing a gene drug, made by Biogen Idec, on mesothelioma and other chest tumours. The drug consists of a cold virus genetically altered to carry the gene for interferon beta, a natural human protein that helps fight disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The treatment involves infusing 900 billion viral particles into a small space at the bottom of the chest cavity. If all went as planned, the gene-carrying viruses would be taken up by the tumour cells, and production of interferon beta would begin. The interferon beta, in turn, would marshal immune cells into action.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris appreciated the doctor's candour in saying his chances for a recovery were remote. The gene drug was being tested in a "Phase I" clinical trial, designed to study safety, not effectiveness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On March 7, after his cancer doctor said more chemo was pointless, Mr. Harris became the 10th patient to get the gene drug at Penn. He knew there were risks in taking an unproved drug. But he had to try something; he couldn't just sit back and die.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over the next few months, he stood to become a well-off man, from settling his lawsuit with 13 companies that made asbestos-containing products.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He had his family and a new wife.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He also wanted to get back to his pottery and sculpture.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I let the clay dictate to me what it wants to do," was how he described his method. "Then at a certain point I have to take back over."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Maybe he could do the same with his cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- - -  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In late May, Dr. Sterman sat before a bank of computers, studying the before and after images of Mr. Harris' lungs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now that he had received one dose of the drug, Dr. Sterman wondered, could he get a second?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sterman had never given a repeat dose to anyone in the experiment, though he had certainly thought about it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With one dose, up to 30% of mice with large mesothelioma tumours had been cured; with two doses, close to 70% had.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sterman knew that what worked in mice often didn't work in people. But the mouse results offered a rationale for allowing a second dose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For Mr. Harris to qualify for a second dose, his cancer would have to be considered "stable."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sterman and his nurse coordinator took careful measurements on the screen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found only a slight progression; his disease was stable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Now Dr. Sterman would have to get the second dose approved by the hospital's institutional review board and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He went off to see Mr. Harris, who was waiting in an exam room.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The measurements we took are almost identical, which by our criteria means you have stable disease," Dr. Sterman explained.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris, sitting on the exam table, clapped at the news.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sterman drew a diagram to show what might be happening.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We haven't stopped the tumour from growing, but we may have slowed its rate of growth."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris let out a relieved "thank you."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I'm going to go home and kick up my heels," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- - -  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">On July 18, Dr. Sterman examined Mr. Harris one last time before administering the coveted second dose.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Do you feel like a pioneer?" he asked, checking Mr. Harris over.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I feel like a pilot, ready to take off," Mr. Harris said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sterman picked up a thick syringe of solution containing 900 billion viral particles. Slowly, he injected it into a catheter leading to Mr. Harris' chest cavity. It took about two minutes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Afterward, Dr. Sterman sat on Mr. Harris' bed and watched the monitors tracking his patient's blood pressure, heart rate and breathing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The next hour would be critical.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Sterman believed in the treatment, but still, he was on guard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The death of Jesse Gelsinger was not far from his mind.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It would be 60 days until follow-up PET and CAT scans would show whether Mr. Harris's cancer had responded. But there were more immediate concerns.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was possible he could have an acute immune reaction right after the injection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At first, the time passed uneventfully.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">By late afternoon, the chills and fever hit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctor reassured Mr. Harris that flu-like symptoms were to be expected. It meant that the viral particles were active.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">All through the night, the fever and chills continued.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He tried to sleep but was too scared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sometime before dawn, he fell asleep. When he woke, it felt like a new day.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He wondered what there was to eat.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">- - -  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Mr. Harris was running late. It was Sept. 15, the day he would learn if his second dose had done any good.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Two days earlier, the nurse had given him a preview of what the doctor's verdict might be. The way he figured it, no matter what his prognosis was, 19 months had passed since he was diagnosed, and he was still alive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Uh-oh, got bad news," Mr. Harris said, taking a read of Dr. Sterman's face as he sat down in the exam room.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"No, I don't. No, I don't. In fact, I've got good news," Dr. Sterman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctor explained that the CAT scan showed no signs that the cancer had progressed. Even better, the PET scan, which measures the level of cancer activity, showed some improvement since the second dose. At the base of his lung, some cancer might have cleared.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Hot dog!" Harris yelped.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists have taken a new step in the quest for gene therapy for muscular dystrophy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three years after researchers experimenting with mice discovered that gene therapy might one day work, another team has found a way to deliver such therapy throughout the body.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Pittsburgh researchers were able to deliver a miniature gene -- similar to the defective gene involved in muscular dystrophy -- throughout the bodies of mice, showing that systemic therapy is possible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their findings are reported in the online edition of Proceedings of the National Academy of Science.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers used a miniature gene, similar in function to the defective one, and showed it could be delivered to muscles throughout the mouse, and the animals exhibited some improvement.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"While we have much farther to go until we can say gene therapy will work in children, we have shown here a glimmer of hope by presenting the first evidence of a successful gene therapy approach," said Dr. Xiao Xiao, associate professor of molecular genetics and biochemistry. Co-author Dr. Chungping Qiao said it's probably unrealistic to expect complete success using the mini-gene.  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian researchers believe they have unravelled one of the biggest mysteries of why some fetuses don't grow normally -- a discovery that could lead in a year to a simple blood test to detect babies at risk of being born too small.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fetal growth restriction is the second leading cause of death in newborns in the developed world, behind premature birth. About three per cent of babies are affected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a significant number and they are way over represented in the intensive care units," says Dr. Andree Gruslin, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at the Ottawa Hospital.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Growth-restricted babies are born with scrawny limbs, tiny muscles and loose, dry skin. They're five times more likely to die in the weeks after birth than normal babies, and those who survive are at increased risk of heart disease, diabetes and other complications when they become adults.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some weigh as little as 450 grams (0.99 pounds) and many of the babies can't be carried to term. Dr. Gruslin once followed a woman who suffered eight miscarriages before finally having a baby that grew normally.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These were real losses. This woman was losing pregnancies at 24 weeks, 28 weeks," says Dr. Gruslin, an associate scientist at the Ottawa Health Research Institute.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Perinatal losses are extremely traumatic and when they're repeated, they're horrible. There's also a feeling of what have I done? Have I caused this? What is wrong with me? So (there's) a lot of guilt as well, and a lot of anxiety."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It was already known that the placenta, which provides oxygen and nutrients to the baby, needs to grow properly to support the fetus. The organ breathes for the baby and acts as a kidney and liver.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We know that babies that are born too small also have very small placentas," says Dr. Gruslin. "We thought, if we could understand what controls growth of the placenta, then we could understand what controls growth of the baby."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her team's study is published today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They looked at a molecule called insulin-like growth factor II, or IGF-2. Previous studies in mice had shown that, if the gene that makes the protein is knocked out, the babies are born extremely small and with small placentas.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But for IGF-2 to work, it needs to be cut into smaller pieces so that it can be processed. The Ottawa team went looking for the scissors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the collaborators already knew that a particular enzyme found in the ovaries and testes could cut the IGF-2 protein. In the new study, they found the same enzyme in the placenta.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When IGF-2 was cut and made fully active, it allowed placental cells to invade the mother's uterus.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If that doesn't happen, then you have miscarriages and fetuses that are growth restricted," Dr. Gruslin says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The team compared blood samples from eight women who had normal babies with seven whose babies were born small. The mothers of the small babies had a lot more IGF-2 that wasn't processed, meaning the enzyme wasn't working properly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The wonderful thing that could come out of this, and this is obviously years and years away, is gene therapy for these infants," Dr. Gruslin says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">More immediately, the researchers are working on a blood test that could detect the defective enzyme as early as the first trimester of pregnancy. Those babies could then be closely monitored and delivered early if they're at risk of dying in the womb.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What typically happens now, is the problem isn't detected until the woman's uterus is measured with a measuring tape during a routine prenatal visit. "But it's not 100 per cent, it's not very sensitive and so a lot of cases are missed. And a lot of cases come and it's too late," Dr. Gruslin says. "We don't have an extremely good way of picking them up."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Carole Aylwin of Gatineau was 17 weeks pregnant when tests showed her baby wasn't growing normally. Three weeks later, doctors discovered more problems with fetal blood flow, and that the placenta was thick and dense.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At that time they started to tell us the outcome most probably was going to be negative," she says.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Her son, whom they named Gabriel, was delivered stillborn last October when Ms. Aylwin was six months pregnant. "You're never prepared for that kind of experience," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ms. Aylwin is now 13 weeks pregnant. So far the baby appears to be developing normally.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO, Fla.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">ORLANDO, Fla. -- Dozens of rodents scurry about in a lab at a Philadelphia veterinary hospital. These genetically altered mice and rats are much bigger and stronger than what you would find in a pet store.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They have already provided tremendous hope, possibly holding the keys to long-sought medical cures. As with many scientific advances, however, the experiments being conducted on these muscle-bound rodents are also a source of growing concern.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy, experts say, could change everything. Especially in the sporting world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This will make steroids look like a walk in the park," said Dr. Bob Goldman, a leading steroids expert for 25 years. "No one will even be talking about steroids. They'll be totally moot. It's like comparing an abacus to a supercomputer."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy is the medical community's attempt to manipulate existing genes to strengthen and change people's physical makeup and, potentially, their athletic performance.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Though gene therapy is in its early stages, the promise it holds for future medical advances is vast. Genes that cause cancers and other diseases might be eliminated. Others might be introduced to help stave off diseases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And still others might be used for purposes other than their original intent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's why sports officials are closely monitoring developments in the field. They have seen the damage that steroids have wreaked and know that gene therapy, which thus far is undetectable through testing, might render 20th century sporting records meaningless.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most experts agree that the use of gene therapy in sports is three to 10 years away, but that doesn't mean they're not scrambling now. The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA), which regulates and tests for banned substances in sports, is so worried it has already banned the procedure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, scientists have not figured out a way to detect gene therapy, which means that someday, athletes could change their genetic makeup with no risk of getting caught.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are some athletes who are desperate to get ahead," said Dr. Peter Davis, director of the U.S. Olympic Committee's Coaching and Sport Sciences Center. "It is an arms race. They're desperate for an edge."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The controversy isn't cut and dried. Scientists and sports officials are still debating what's right and wrong. Though most in athletic circles view this new science as a threat to the purity of sport, the dissenting view is gathering momentum.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Either way, many experts think fundamental change is unavoidable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You won't even be able to put tomorrow's athletes on the same playing field with some of today's athletes," Goldman said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The supersized rats are part of Dr. Lee Sweeney's pet project. Sweeney is a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania who injected his rodents with a gene called IGF-1.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">His research is intended to battle diseases, not to build better athletes. If scientists can develop ways to strengthen muscles, gene therapy can change the life of someone suffering from a degenerative disease, such as muscular dystrophy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweeney studied three groups of mice for eight weeks: a group that was not injected; a group that received treatment and exercised for the testing period; and a third that received the gene but did no exercise.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When we did those first tests," Sweeney said, "I think we were all surprised."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After less than two months, the mice grew more than 15 per cent in muscle volume and strength with no exercise. The muscles of those that exercised grew by 20 per cent to 50 per cent, and their strength almost doubled. Not only that, but in the ensuing weeks, Sweeney found that the  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">IGF-1 mice lost their strength much more slowly.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It didn't take long for Sweeney to realize that his work could translate to athletes. No scientist in the United States is doing legal gene therapy research with the intent of improving athletic performance, but most agree that its reach will still stretch deep into the sports world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some fear that successful gene therapy will be performed on athletes in time for the 2008 Olympics. "I wouldn't be surprised if within the next year or two, it happens," Sweeney said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Among more than a dozen sports experts interviewed by the Orlando Sentinel, most agreed gene therapy should be banned from athletics. It's not a unanimous opinion, though. One noted ethicist offers an alternative view, saying governing bodies might have trouble banning it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We don't outlaw things simply because they give you an advantage," said Michael Josephson, founder of the Josephson Institute of Ethics. "Steroids is where people are sacrificing their future for today. That won't necessarily be the case with gene therapy. Sports will have to evolve with science."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said the primary reason for most banned substances is that they are either illegal or harmful. It's possible gene therapy would be neither. Others say using gene therapy would give an athlete an unnatural advantage over competitors not  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">treated.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The idea of a level playing field is naive," Josephson said. "Why is it more unfair than someone who has a personal trainer or had a private lesson from a very early age? What bothers me is this: Do you think you can ban this and you've suddenly made sports fair?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There are advantages everywhere, physical, psychological. If you have an athlete, and something psychologically is holding him or her back from performing to their potential, what do you do? You send them to a psychologist, and he tries to help and make a better competitor. No one is going to ever say that's unfair."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Andy Miah is a Scottish lecturer at the University of Paisley who authored the book Genetically Modified Athletes: Biomedical Ethics, Gene Doping and Sport. He argues that gene therapy shouldn't be banned, comparing the procedure to cosmetic surgery -- something that might ruffle feathers but isn't necessarily immoral.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Contemporary elite sport is all about performance enhancement, and gene doping is consistent with this philosophy," Miah said. "With gene doping, we are essentially talking about creating people with different kinds of genes or altering genes of people who already are alive. Well, we alter our bodies and minds in all sorts of ways, so I do not see the distinction."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many of those leading the battle against steroids downplay the threat posed by gene therapy, saying it's too early to tell what effect today's research will have on tomorrow's sporting world.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The potential is certainly there," said Larry Bowers of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency. "There are so many technical difficulties and dangers right now that I hope would deter athletes from using it for a period of time still."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweeney, the Pennsylvania scientist, got a glimpse of the future after his experiments showed muscle growth of up to 50 per cent in his mice and rats.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">As soon as his research hit medical journals, his e-mail inbox started to fill up. The requests came from grandparents suffering from muscular dystrophy. They came from the wealthy, hoping for as long a life as possible. And they came from athletes and coaches, thinking they might have found the magic pill.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The subject line of the e-mails were all similar: I'll be your guinea pig.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Sweeney even heard from a high school coach interested in improving the skills of his entire team. Sweeney told them all the same thing and then deleted the e-mail. Before long, though, another e-mail would arrive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I tell them that it would be illegal, that it's not something we're ready to do or able to do. I was surprised I still heard back from them," Sweeney said. "Their response is, 'I don't care.' That surprised me."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many experts look at the current steroids controversy and say it proves at least one thing: Athletes are willing to do whatever it takes to excel on the field. It's the same hypothesis that Goldman's research has been supporting for years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Goldman, a Chicago doctor, has done a similar experiment several times during the past 20 years, surveying almost 200 athletes ages 16 to the mid-30s. He asks each: "I have a magic pill that would ensure you win every single competition, but you will die in five years. Will you take it?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't realistic in this day to think a professional athlete would cite ethical reasons in turning down the offer to get bigger and stronger, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're talking about $100-million contracts. Forget morals and ethics. We're living in a very different world than when people played sport because they enjoyed competition and camaraderie," Goldman said. "You get a player who's 32, and if he can just play another year or two, he'll make enough money to support his family forever."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bowers is used to fighting a faceless enemy. He's the executive director for the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency and has been at the front lines of the battle against steroids. His outfit is trying to understand what gene therapy might do to an athlete's molecular makeup and whether it can ultimately be detected.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Thus far, they have found nothing.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I haven't thrown in the towel," Bowers said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Bowers questions the ethics of any scientist, doctor or practitioner who administers such a treatment, asking "whether it's good medical practice to treat someone with gene therapy when they don't have a disease."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That raises a problem for scientists. In the future, they say, it will make more sense and provide added health benefits to administer gene therapy to people at a young age, rather than waiting for them to start feeling the effects of diseases and illnesses.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is an interesting long-term issue for society," Sweeney said. "Some of these things that we're developing are to prevent weakness in the elderly, and they would work much better if we're able to treat them when they're younger. You want to reach them when they're 25 rather than when they're 50. (But then) you're impacting them when they're in their peak athletic period."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Most fear that gene therapy in sports will surface as an underground treatment long before it's legal for doctors to perform the procedure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the procedure eventually receives U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, one scientist suggests it could be as simple as day surgery: A doctor issues a prescription; a patient checks in for an afternoon appointment; the treatment is administered; and the patient returns home.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it might be several years before the authorities approve gene therapy, Sweeney said there's more time for it to hit the black market.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Scientists in other countries certainly would be capable of doing this," he said. "It's a matter of having enough money to have facilities to do it. But it's not that difficult. There are a lot of people trained as technicians in labs here and in Europe who could reproduce it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think that's what agencies like WADA are afraid of. Some other country where it's not regulated, somebody might set up a for-profit clinic and treat anybody."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Paul Gregorevic is a scientist at the University of Washington who said gene therapy will  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">likely be an expensive procedure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The other thing is going to be, where do you get it from?" he said. "You can't just call someone up out of the phone book and ask for these sort of things."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others suggest that could change farther down the road. It has been 15 years since the start of the Human Genome Project. With thousands of genes still being analyzed, researchers across the globe say big cures lie in tiny strains of genetic code.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think there's no doubt that gene therapy will work," said Dr. Mark Kay, a Stanford geneticist and president of the American Society of Gene Therapy. "I think from the standpoint of putting genes into people's cells to correct diseases, there's no controversy."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's easy to envisage the evolution. The disconnect between the playground and TSN highlight reels might be astronomical.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">What makes gene therapy unique is that the sports community is able to approach it differently from the steroids controversy. Instead of being reactive, those who govern sports can anticipate the change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now, it's all theory," said Davis, the official with the U.S. Olympic Committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Anti-doping officials are forced to deal with gene therapy as an imminent threat, even as they continue to battle the steroids controversy, struggling to keep sports as clean as possible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Geneticists and sports officials listen closely for word of any scientific advancement. They know that China has the first licensed gene therapy product on the market, a British company is researching gene therapy in horses and a U.S. pharmaceutical company may be close to a human trial.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You have some other countries that are very motivated from the sports angle," said Goldman, the Chicago-based steroids expert. "During the Cold War, you remember the Russians and the East Germans were very motivated in this area. There is a lot of money to be made in the former Soviet Union, some parts of Europe, some Asian countries -- we don't know what they're doing."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Until there's an admission on someone's part, some say it will be difficult to determine when the first athletes receive gene therapy treatments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Others suggest that it will be blatantly obvious for fans, critics and anyone who flips on the television and notices that a molecular tweak has resulted in a massive change.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Cheating is a part of sports," Goldman said. "You do the best you can, but you're never going to stop it. Just like you can't stop crime and can't stop disease. The cops and doctors do the best they can, though."  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person died after their brain was injected with millions of genetically engineered skin cells. A second had serious complications.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the remaining six volunteers involved in the first gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease have shown a reduction in their rate of cognitive decline, according to a report today in the journal Nature Medicine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The results of the California experiment are so "positive" that doctors are now embarking on a second trial, this time injecting millions of genetically altered viruses into the brains of six Alzheimer's patients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Canadian specialists warn there are plenty of risks and unknowns. There are also concerns about the manner in which the California experiment was designed and is now being presented.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The two patients seriously harmed by the brain injections have been "effectively erased" in the researchers' upbeat statements that the gene therapy had "no long-term adverse effects," says Francoise Baylis, a bioethicist at Dalhousie University.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is plainly false," Baylis said. "Two of eight subjects suffered significant adverse effects as a result of the researchers' efforts at gene delivery."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The trial, led by Dr. Mark Tuszynski, a neurologist at the University of California San Diego and a biotechnology entrepreneur, was designed to test the safety of drilling small holes in patients' heads and inserting genetically engineered skin cells into their brains. The cells were fitted with a gene to produce nerve growth factor, a natural protein that can prevent cell death and stimulates cell function.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After extensive testing in animals, the doctors recruited five women and three men with early Alzheimer's disease to undergo brain injections in 2001 and 2002. Skin cells were taken from the volunteers' bodies, to avoid immune reaction when injected into the brain, and then re-engineered to produce nerve growth factor.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers initially injected the cells into patients who were lightly sedated but still awake. Two patients "abruptly moved when the injection needle was in the brain," which caused bleeding, says the Nature Medicine report. One of the patients died five weeks later.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remaining six volunteers were put under general anesthesia for the injections, without complication.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the doctors acknowledge the problems with the first two injections, they stress the positive. Brain scans and cognitive tests on the six patients over the last two years indicate the injections slowed their cognitive decline by 36 to 51 per cent, say Tuszynski and his team. The researchers also documented increased metabolic activity in the brains of the patients who are still alive, and "robust growth" of brain cells near the sight of injection in the patient who died.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One person died after their brain was injected with millions of genetically engineered skin cells. A second had serious complications. But the remaining six volunteers involved in the first gene therapy for Alzheimer's disease have shown a reduction in their rate of cognitive decline, according to a report published today in the journal Nature Medicine. The results of the California experiment are so "positive" that doctors are embarking on a second trial, this time injecting millions of genetically altered viruses into the brains of six Alzheimer's patients. Dr. Jack Diamond, scientific director of the Alzheimer Society of Canada, describes the results of the California study as "modest, but not compelling." He says it will take much more detailed study to determine whether the nerve growth triggered by the gene therapy stimulates the "right kind of connections" in the brain. An estimated 350,000 Canadians have Alzheimer's disease and related dementias today.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON - The first attempt at gene therapy for Alzheimer's patients appeared to significantly delay worsening of the disease in a few people who have tested it so far, scientists reported yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Far more research is needed to see if the experimental treatment, which requires a form of brain surgery, really helps. But if the approach pans out, researchers say delivering protective substances, called growth factors, into a diseased brain holds the potential to rescue some dying brain cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In one patient, the brain tissue showed new growth, which was a first, according to a study published in Sunday's edition of the journal Nature Medicine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It won't cure the disease," said the lead researcher, Dr. Mark Tuszynski of the University of California, San Diego. That is because Alzheimer's destroys different types of cells in different areas of the brain; the new gene therapy targets just one of those.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The preliminary success indicates that similar approaches might help other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's, Dr. Tuszynski said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers took skin cells from eight patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's and modified the genes to secrete a protein found in healthy brains called nerve growth factor, or NGF. Earlier studies had shown that injecting NGF-producing tissue into the brains of aging monkeys could reverse deterioration. Doctors drilled holes into the patients' skulls and implanted the NGF-producing skin cells directly onto Alzheimer's-injured spots.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Six patients were tracked for almost two years. Tests involving memory and other skills found their rate of cognitive decline slowed by 36 per cent to 51 per cent, better than is usually seen with medication, Dr. Tuszynski reported.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fifteen years after experiments with human gene therapy began in earnest, a U.S. federal drug advisory panel will discuss today the death of a French child in one such experiment and why, after so many years of hope, the technology has been such a disappointment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three major gene therapy trials in the United States have been suspended pending the outcome of the meeting. Dr. Donald Kohn, the principal investigator in one of those trials, said that the type of immune deficiency in his trial's patients was different from that in the French research and that the genes that were made the target of the therapies were therefore also different.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For years, gene therapy was heralded as a technology that would soon yield blockbuster drug innovations. The National Institutes of Health issued thousands of grants to pursue the research, hundreds of patents have been granted on the technology, and more than 150 biotechnology companies have been created in the last 15 years to exploit it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy's disappointing history is mirrored in other medical technologies once highly promoted, like the decoding of the human genome. Reaping the fruits of such technological advances is taking much longer than executives in biotechnology and pharmaceuticals once suggested.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A single change in a human gene may hold the key to preventing people living with HIV from progressing to full-blown AIDS, researchers said on yesterday.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They found a crucial difference between a gene in humans and one in rhesus monkeys that blocks infection of the virus in the animals -- a finding that offers new insights into the origins of AIDS and gene therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Had the gene been the same in humans, scientists at the National Institute of Medical Research in London believe, there may not have been the AIDS epidemic that now affects 40 million people worldwide.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If it had recognized HIV, we probably would never have had AIDS. I believe it is a key change," said Dr. Jonathan Stoye, head of virology at the institute.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists had been aware that it was much more difficult to infect monkey cells with HIV than human cells in laboratory experiments, which suggested there was something different in the animal cells that blocked infection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A gene called Trim 5 alpha was later found to be the reason why. In monkeys, but not in humans, it stops the virus from replicating.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Stoye and his team studied differences in the gene products of the monkey and human Trim 5 alpha genes. They pinpointed one specific change in a protein that was important in blocking HIV. By substituting a human protein with a monkey-derived protein they found they could make the human cells resistant to HIV.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The discovery has significant implications for the development of effective gene therapy to combat AIDS," said Stoye, who reported the findings in the journal Current Biology.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He and his team believe introducing the gene carrying that single change back into human cells would make those cells resistant to HIV infection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy is an experimental technique which introduces genetic material into cells to fight disease. The technique has been used for Parkinson's disease and in trials for illnesses such as cystic fibrosis and cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you have HIV this might be a form of therapy to prevent progression to AIDS," said Stoye.  </p>

</div><div class="author">Meredith Macleod  </div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>724 words</div><div>10 May 2004</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2004 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMaster's Dr. Jack Gauldie will soon get the results of animal trials that hold the promise of creating a SARS vaccine.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That would mark a huge breakthrough in combating the deadly virus that killed 774 people last year, including 44 in Canada, and sickened thousands.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But beyond infectious diseases like SARS, the research of Gauldie and others working in gene therapeutics holds the potential for the true "cure" of a range of genetic diseases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gauldie, a pre-eminent gene researcher and director of McMaster University's Centre for Gene Therapeutics, will talk about the vast new frontier of work tomorrow night in a lecture called Genes as Medicine: From Growth Factors to Vaccines.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's the last in a season of Science in the City lectures sponsored by McMaster University and The Spectator.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gauldie will begin with a whirlwind tour of the basics of gene research: What is a gene? How can it be isolated? How can we use genes to deliver medicine and vaccines to an ailing body?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists know a whole lot about the sequencing of the human genetic code and continue to identify new genes among the 30,000 found in humans. Researchers understand how the human body can replicate genes placed into cells from outside and then produce the necessary proteins to carry out the functions of the human body.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The problem is in the delivery. Finding the best way to get into the correct cell and orienting the gene the right way so that it works permanently, is the challenge, says Gauldie.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Right now we don't know how to do it easily, safely and so that it's easily reproducible. We know how to get the gene from outside to inside the cell but once inside it's not working as well as we would like it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gauldie's work focuses on using the common cold virus -- adenovirus -- to deliver vaccines. Since the virus easily makes its way into cells through the nose, throat or lungs, researchers have found a way to "piggyback" a gene-based vaccine onto the virus.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's too dangerous to work with the SARS virus to develop a vaccine," said Gauldie. "But we know the genes of the virus and have identified one of them that is the code for the protein that sticks on the outside of the SARS virus. It's called the spike protein."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">That's the gene that is injected into the common cold virus. In that way, the SARS virus is crippled because it can't replicate itself. The SARS protein is delivered into the cell, which triggers the body's immune system to start fighting.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"So now we have immunity without having the true virus."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gauldie expects to have the results of vaccine trials on mice and ferrets in a couple of weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The same basic delivery principle can be adapted to a whole host of diseases including cancer, diabetes, cystic fibrosis, arthritis, HIV, hemophilia, hepatitis, respiratory problems and growth deficiencies.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It's really cutting-edge stuff. Scientists have only known enough about the human gene makeup for about 10 years. But Gauldie says it will only be 10 or 15 years before gene therapy is a commonly-used treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Things go wrong when genes don't work right or they're working too hard or there's too many or too few or they're in the wrong sequence. This is a new way of treating disease at that level."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Critics of gene-based medical research argue it's a slippery slope down from manipulating genes to fight disease to human cloning or messing around with human evolution.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are so far away from that, that we can't even think about how to do that," said Gauldie.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tomorrow's Science in the City lecture is free and open to the public. It will be held in The Spectator auditorium, 44 Frid St. Doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the talk begins at 7 p.m.  </p>

Toddlers' cancer imperils future of gene therapy: Virus technique

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Canadian scientist who pioneered the gene therapy technique that
apparently caused cancer in two French toddlers says researchers will
probably abandon its use.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"After this, I can't imagine anybody's going to want to do this now
unless they're really sure they've solved this problem," said Alan
Bernstein, president of the Canadian Institutes for Health Research.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration suspended 27
clinical trials that use retroviruses to insert genes into blood stem
cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This is the second time since October health officials have halted
such clinical trials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Trials were also halted temporarily in 1999 when a Pennsylvania
teenager died after undergoing gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers fear the the controversy will cast a shadow over all
viruses used in gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"The public doesn't make any distinction," said George Karpati, a
researcher at the Montreal Neurological Institute. "They will just use
the same umbrella for all [viruses] and it will have a negative effect
on gene therapy in general, and we are bracing ourselves for that."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To date, just 40 gene therapy trials on humans have been conducted in
Canada. Although 14 are ongoing, none involves the technique under
suspicion. The majority involve the use of adenovirus, which is
considered much safer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists have long warned the use of retroviruses to deliver genes
could cause cancer, because they permanently invade the DNA of cells. In
1988, Dr. Bernstein's lab in Toronto was the first to use retroviruses
to put new genes into the blood stem cells of mice. In clinical
meetings, he and other scientists expressed concern the retroviruses
might disrupt human cancer genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"That appears to be what's happening here," Dr. Bernstein said. "But
it seems to be happening with much higher frequency than one could ever
have imagined."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The setbacks have deflated much of the hype for gene therapy, which
seemed to have boundless potential a decade ago.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Initially, it looked like it was going to be pretty simple," Dr.
Bernstein said. "You take an individual with a genetic defect where we
know what the gene is. We know that it's only one gene that's altered
and we know if we can put the gene back in, we can fix the defect."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But experiments showed success would be elusive. In some genetic
disorders, the damage is irreversible. Sometimes, the new genes didn't
"turn on," or the damaged cells were too difficult to reach. Finally,
the medical procedure itself could prove harmful.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After a decade of research, the treatments in France were considered
the only unblemished success. Nine out of 11 young boys treated for
X-SCID, a fatal deficiency of the immune system known as "bubble-boy
disease" were essentially cured of the disease. They left hospital and
began normal lives.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But three months ago, one of the boys developed a condition similar to
leukemia. A few weeks before Christmas French researchers let the FDA
know a second boy had fallen ill.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers are shocked. Most believed the chance of a retrovirus
invading the DNA near a cancer gene was remote, since the human genome
is at least 30,000 genes long.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers say not all gene therapies using retroviruses pose this
danger. Five Canadian trials have used them in the past without mishap.
But the French technique used retroviruses to insert genes into
blood-producing stem cells. This is considered risky because these cells
multiply quickly, and leukemia is a disease in which white blood cells
proliferate out of control.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Despite the problems in France, some scientists say gene therapy still
has a promising future.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Anthony Ridgway, a manager at the biologics and genetic therapies
directorate of Health Canada, said Health Canada would closely
scrutinize any future human trials that use retroviruses and stem cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He noted boys with X-SCID often die of infections at a young age, and
the risk of possible leukemia might be one worth taking.

Parkinson's gene therapy ready for human trials: Deep brain
surgery
</b>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A gene therapy experiment to counter the devastating effects of
Parkinson's disease was so successful on rats that scientists are now
getting ready to try the operation on people.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technique -- which involves infecting neurons deep in the brain
with a gene to "reset" a cluster of cells that causes the impaired
movement of Parkinson's -- appears to delay or even halt progression of
the incurable disease in mice and monkeys. The findings appear today in
the journal Science.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
An estimated 100,000 Canadians have Parkinson's disease. Symptoms
usually start with mild tremours and eventually leave patients unable to
move.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
People with the disease suffer a loss of certain nerve cells in the
brain that make dopamine, a signal transmitter. Loss of dopamine causes
some neurons to fire uncontrollably.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The most common treatment is synthetic dopamine, taken as a drug
called levodopa, and its many variants. But as the disease progresses,
patients need increasingly large doses of the drug to control their
symptoms, and the drug comes with side effects, such as dyskinesia --
involuntary movements and tics.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
For patients who no longer respond to drugs, surgeons may perform a
pallidotomy. This involves drilling a hole in the skull and inserting an
electric probe to destroy part of the global pallidus, which most
experts believe is overactive in Parkinson's patients. Another option is
thalamotomy, which is similar to pallidotomy but targets a specific
group of cells in the thalamus (the brain's message relay centre). This
is the operation Michael J. Fox, the Canadian actor and Parkinson's
sufferer, underwent.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A promising new alternative is deep brain stimulation (DBS). In this
technique, surgeons implant a very thin electrode into the brain and use
small electrical pulses from an implanted device, similar to a cardiac
pacemaker, to stimulate the brain and block brain signals that cause
Parkinson's symptoms. It usually targets cells in the thalamus or
subthalamus. Michael Pitfield, the Canadian senator, underwent this
procedure last year and reports his symptoms have been reduced.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, surgery and DBS both have limitations and side effects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Our approach is based on a similar rationale, but we use gene therapy
to adjust the chemical signalling of these brain areas to a more normal
setting," says Michael Kaplitt, director of stereotactic and functional
neurosurgery at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York. "This
exploits the best parts of current therapy but makes it more powerful,
less invasive and potentially safer."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Kaplitt and co-investigator Matthew During, a professor of molecular
medicine at the University of Auckland, inserted the GAD gene into a
virus known as adeno-associated virus. The GAD gene makes a protein that
dampens the activity of neurons. Then the researchers put the virus into
the subthalamic nucleus -- an area near the back of the brain which is
involved in limb control -- where it infected the hyperactive cells and
delivered the GAD gene. This appears to reset the brain network and
restores normal movement.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We are very encouraged that in addition to the affect this therapy
has on quieting symptoms, we present evidence that suggests it may
arrest or delay disease progression," During says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Results in animal studies have been so encouraging, U.S. authorities
have granted permission to conduct a small, Phase 1 clinical trial in
humans to assess the technique's safety. It is expected to begin in a
few months.

Successful gene therapy halted to study side effect: Cured
'bubble boy disease'

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
French doctors have suspended studies of the first gene therapy ever
to work -- a treatment that appears to cure the rare immune disorder
dubbed "bubble boy disease" -- because one of the boys treated has
developed a leukemia-like side effect.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is unclear whether the therapy caused the boy's new illness and, if
so, how often such a side effect would occur.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The boy is responding well to treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The other seven children given the same gene therapy at Paris's Necker
Hospital are doing well, but France's public health agency announced
yesterday all the families had been notified about the possible risk.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
U.S. regulatory officials have put on hold three clinical trials for
the same therapy that had been poised to start soon, while doctors
update the patient consent forms with information about the French
illness. And several patients given similar treatment dating back 10
years have been contacted to have the possible risk explained, said Dr.
Phil Noguchi of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA's scientific advisers will evaluate the possible risk, in
consultation with the scientists from Paris, at a meeting next week.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is unusual for a single side effect to generate such public
attention -- in studies of regular drugs, many people typically must
become ill before research is put on hold.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, gene therapy has been a publicly charged topic since the 1999
death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger in a University of Pennsylvania
study of a completely different disease generated headlines.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Although this is a sobering event," airing potential side effects
very publicly is good for the still-evolving field of gene therapy, Dr.
Noguchi said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The bubble-boy gene therapy remains very promising, he stressed.
Without treatment, these children die -- and even regular therapy brings
a risk of death without the promise of a full cure that the gene therapy
appears to provide.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Indeed, the boy with the leukemia-like syndrome this year survived an
infection that, prior to his treatment, likely would have proved fatal,
Dr. Noguchi said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
At issue is severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID, an inherited
disease that occurs in about one in 75,000 births.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The best-known victim was David, the "bubble boy" from Houston, Tex.,
who lived in a germ-proof enclosure until his death at age 12 in 1984.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The French boys treated with the gene therapy had X-linked SCID, a
severe form of the disease that strikes only boys. They lacked a crucial
protein because of a genetic mutation that prevented their bodies from
making essential disease-fighting immune cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Alain Fischer at Necker Hospital drew bone marrow from the boys,
culled stem cells from it and mixed them with a virus in which a gene
that makes the missing protein had been inserted. When the boys' cells
were injected back into their bloodstreams, they worked properly.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Some studies in the United States have found partial success with a
similar gene therapy given to children with a different form of the
disease, called SCID-ADA.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">AMSTERDAM  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The remnants of lunch were on Wilco Conradi's rosy cheeks when the two-year-old grabbed a large ice cream and ran back to the table.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Let's see if this tastes OK," he said, climbing onto his mother's lap and drawing a giggle.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This summertime outing at the zoo once was unthinkable for the Dutch boy, who lived his first months in a germ-proof plastic enclosure after being born with severe combined immunodeficiency, or SCID. The plastic enclosure protected Wilco from infections that would have killed him.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the blond, blue-eyed boy underwent a new gene therapy technique that apparently cured his disease and allowed him to leave his plastic bubble. He needs no medication or special treatment and eats a regular diet.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He can go to school, go on vacation and live like any other child," said his father, Theo Conradi. "Just look at him!"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilco is among the first four boys to undergo the new treatment -- all with successful results -- for the inherited disease that occurs in about one of every 75,000 births. The disorder, which is carried by women but afflicts only boys, has plagued Wilco's family for generations, killing one of his uncles and two cousins.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The illness renders the immune system ineffective against microbes ordinarily harmless to people with normal resistance. The best-known victim was David, Houston's famous "Bubble Boy," who lived in a germ-proof plastic enclosure until his death at age 12 in 1984.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Many afflicted babies are saved by bone-marrow transplants, but for the rest of their lives must take monthly intravenous infusions of antibodies culled from donated blood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Wilco was a baby when he received the experimental treatment at the Hopital Necker-Enfants Malades in Paris. After receiving a single injection of genetically modified stem cells, Wilco now has a normal immune system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In April, the experimental procedure passed its first major test when Wilco got sick.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"He had chicken pox and recovered on his own," said Dr. Nico Wulffraat, an immunologist at the Wilhelmina Children's Hospital in Utrecht. "Normally, that would have been lethal."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boy has no signs of complications -- such as fever or infection -- that could indicate problems, Wulffraat said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Everything looks right, but we are closely following his case," Wulffraat said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Several other children have now received the same treatment."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Similar gene therapy might be used to fight other inherited disorders, Wulffraat said, "but these children will have to be followed for a long time" to know the long-term results.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the Artis Zoo in downtown Amsterdam, Wilco scampered off with his 12-year-old sister, Petra, to play on the slide as his parents explained how the treatment lifted what seemed like a family curse.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Their second child, Wilma, died of a brain tumour a year before Wilco was born.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It feels like we have been given a second chance," said Wilco's mother, Roelien.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But it is still difficult to treat him like a normal child."  </p>

Gene therapy being tested on heart patients

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In theory, gene therapy offers hope as the answer to myriad medical
problems. But can theory translate into reality?
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Terence Deane is keen to find out. So keen that he signed up to be the
first subject in a clinical trial that should determine whether
delivering a gene that promotes blood vessel growth to the heart will
ease the suffering of people like him, known in the cardiac care
community as "no option patients."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Deane, 58, suffered a heart attack nearly a decade ago and has battled
severely clogged arteries ever since. He is no longer a candidate for
arterial bypass surgery or angioplasty (a procedure in which a blocked
artery is cleared using a small balloon inserted via a catheter).
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Chest pain is a constant companion, forcing him into early retirement
and making him think twice about many of the small tasks most people do
as a matter of course. "The quality of life is very poor," said Deane,
who lives in Windsor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A week ago, doctors at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto made a small
incision in his groin. They threaded a catheter bearing a small needle
up to his heart and injected blood-starved portions of that organ with
either the gene treatment -- known as vascular endothelial growth factor
-- or a placebo. The trial is a randomized, double-blind one, meaning
neither the researchers leading the study nor Deane will know until the
trial is over whether he received the placebo or the growth factor. The
trial is expected to last two years.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Duncan Stewart is the lead investigator of the trial, which will
eventually enrol 110 similar patients at cardiac centres in Toronto,
Victoria, Montreal, Edmonton and Quebec City. The lead hospital is St.
Michael's, where Stewart is head of cardiology.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Previous studies at St. Michael's have confirmed the safety of the
procedure. But Stewart believes this is the first clinical trial in
North America to test the efficacy of using gene therapy to increase
blood flow to the hearts of patients like Deane, who make up about 15
per cent of cardiac patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The process of developing new blood vessels occurs constantly in the
body. Often when an arterial blockage occurs, the body compensates by
developing secondary routes into the heart.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There's a lot of patients walking around with blocked arteries, a
single blocked artery, that are feeling perfectly fine," said Dr.
Michael Kutryk, a co-investigator on the trial.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"And the reason is that something within them has allowed them to make
blood vessels very well from other blood vessels in the heart. They
compensate. And some individuals don't make those blood vessels as
well."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers hope that by giving these patients a gene that
encourages blood vessel growth, they'll be able to do what healthy
individuals do naturally.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"What we're trying to do is add additional fuel lines," Stewart said.
"The body does this on its own. It's just that in people like Mr. Deane,
it's not efficient enough."

Bursting the bubble; The technique is risky and experimental, and
the jargon is difficult and medical sounding, but a radiant two-year-old
girl from Jerusalem named Salsabil is giving doctors the world over
confidence that gene therapy may yet live up to the incredible promise
that heralded its first attempt 12 years ago.

Steve Connor
</div><div>1223 words</div><div>28 June 2002</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>B04</div><div>English</div><div>

</div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Her name is Salsabil. She is an Arab-Israeli from Jerusalem.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Her survival is living testament to the growing realization that gene
therapy may have come of age after many years of false hopes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Doctors throughout the world are growing increasingly confident about
the future of gene therapy, a technique where "healthy" genes are
injected into a patient to replace their defective DNA.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Salsabil was born in February 2000 into a family with a history of the
SCID gene disorder.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One of her siblings had died of the disease and an older sister,
Tasmin, had survived only after a transplant of blood cells from the
umbilical cord of a younger, unaffected brother.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Unfortunately for Salsabil, there were no suitable donors for either a
bone-marrow transplant or for stem cells from the umbilical cord blood.
At seven months of age doctors decided gene therapy was the only option.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The team was led by Professor Shimon Slavin, Shoshana Morecki and
Memet Akar of the Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Centre in
Jerusalem. They worked with Claudio Bordignon and colleagues at the San
Raffaele Institute for Gene Therapy in Milan.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Israeli surgeons extracted bone marrow from Salsabil and mingled the
cells with a genetically engineered virus containing a healthy copy of
the affected gene.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The virus, engineered to be harmless, automatically injects the human
gene directly into the nucleus of the bone-marrow cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Before the doctors transfused the bone marrow back into Salsabil, they
performed a radical procedure to increase the chances of the technique
working. They subjected Salsabil to a mild form of chemotherapy --
called non-myeloblative conditioning -- to suppress her defective bone
marrow cells and prepare the ground for the transfused cells to
multiply.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Bordignon said yesterday: "Non-myeloblative conditioning means you
don't really wipe out the bone marrow, you just give one of the drugs
used for a transplant, at a much lower dose, to make 'space' for
engineered marrow to seize, expand and grow better."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It worked. Within weeks of having a transfusion of her own marrow,
Salsabil began to show signs of recovery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The infused stem cells migrated naturally to her bone marrow and began
making several of the key cells of the immune system, such as the white
blood cells known as B and T lymphocytes. Within months, Salsabil began
making her own antibodies for the first time, when before she had to
rely on those in her mother's milk. She responded normally to a tetanus
vaccine and even survived chickenpox.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Within a year she had shrugged off the respiratory infections, chronic
diarrhea and scabies that had plagued her since birth. She was allowed
home and needed no treatment. She was effectively cured of a disease
written in her genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I would call this a cure," Slavin said. "We have achieved
100-per-cent replacement of her defective bone marrow cells. She is a
cute little girl. The concept can be applied to all genetic diseases
where there is a need to engineer stem cells to produce normal products,
especially when patients have no matched donor available for safe bone
marrow transplantation."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It is not the first time that doctors have cured SCID children with
gene therapy, but it is the first time a child has been cured of such a
complex form of the disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Salsabil suffered from a lack of an enzyme called adenosine deaminase
(ADA), which results in a number of abnormalities of the immune system
and is considered the most complex and most difficult SCID to treat.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
W. French Anderson of the University of Southern California, who was
the first to try to treat ADA deficiency by gene therapy, said yesterday
the Italian-Israeli study was an important advance for the entire
concept of gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"This gives a boost to the whole field because it proves our basic
premise, that if you can get enough gene-engineered cells into the
patient it will cure the disease," he said. "That is very important and
this is very exciting."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It was not always so. After the initial hype that heralded the first
gene therapy attempt by Anderson in 1990, the prognosis did not look
good.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy alone did not cure in the way it was meant to and two
little girls -- Ashanthi deSilva and Carly Todd, the first gene therapy
patients in America and Britain respectively -- had to rely on more
conventional treatment to survive.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There was initially a great burst of enthusiasm that lasted three,
four years where a couple of hundred trials got started all over the
world," Anderson said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Then we realized that nothing was really working at the clinical
level." The worst moment came in September 1999 when an American patient
called Jesse Gelsinger died after a gene therapy injection into his
liver.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
No one knows why he died, but it may have been linked to the virus
used in the experimental procedure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists had to redouble their efforts to ensure the safety of any
viruses used in the many and varied trials, which included attempts at
treating cancer with genetically modified cells as well as treatments
for some of the 4,000 or so inherited disorders caused by a single
defective gene, from cystic fibrosis to haemophilia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Finally, in April 2000, scientists in France reported their first
unequivocal success with gene therapy -- on children with another form
of SCID.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This year, doctors at the Institute of Child Health at Great Ormond
Street Hospital in London reported similar success on an 18-month-old
called Rhys Evans who had an SCID caused by a defect in the "gamma c"
gene.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Today Rhys is a healthy two-year-old with no signs of the inherited
disorder that had confined him to a solitary antiseptic hospital room.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Like Salsabil, he mixes freely with other children -- an activity that
might have killed them both before the treatment -- and he now lives the
normal life of any toddler.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Adrian Thrasher, the consultant immunologist at Great Ormond Street
who treated Rhys, said the research from Jerusalem was very encouraging
for the treatment of immunodeficiency by gene therapy. He hopes the
treatment may now be extended to cover other inherited illnesses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There are more than 4,000 genetic conditions, and at least 80
different immune diseases alone," he said. "The technique will have to
be worked out for each individual condition."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Treating diseased cells in the bone marrow is technically easier than
treating the defective genes of, say, nerve tissue or heart muscle.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although gene therapy has now proved effective in curing one or two
diseases, nobody can yet be sure that such treatment can be made to work
in each of the thousands of genetic disorders affecting children.
</p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PARIS  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the most striking success yet for gene therapy, French doctors have apparently cured four little boys of the rare and deadly immune system disorder dubbed "bubble boy disease."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The boys, followed for up to 21/2 years, now have healthy immune systems, are growing normally and live at home after spending their first months in a sterile environment because they could not fight off disease.  </p>

Researchers link attention deficit disorder with immune system:
Gene therapy possible if findings are proven correct

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Israeli scientists say attention deficit hyperactivity disorder could
be caused by the immune system. Their study is the first to report such
a possibility. If the findings are borne out by further research, they
could have significant implications for the way the condition is
treated.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers say many children with AD/HD have a subtle variation
in a gene that makes interleukin-1, which protects the brain from
damage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
If the link is proved, fetuses could someday be treated by gene
therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
AD/HD is a common disorder. It afflicts 4% to 10% of school age
children and can have devastating effects on children and their
families. Untreated, it can lead to failure at school, depression,
behavioural problems, low self- esteem and substance abuse.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The disorder is routinely treated with the drug Ritalin, but the
safety and efficacy of this approach is hotly debated.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Studies of families suggest AD/HD is often inherited from parents, but
scientists have had difficulty pinning down the actual genes, believed
to be part of the dopamine system in the brain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Now, a study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry suggests
the culprit may lie elsewhere.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In recent years, scientists have focused their attention on IL-1. In
the brain, IL-1 helps maintain the organ's ability to recover from
injury and adapt to change, as well as respond to stress. Recent
theories suggest IL-1 may be involved in psychiatric disorders such as
depression.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The protein also advances the maturity of brain cells that are
important for movement and cognition, known as dopaminergic neurons.
Scientists believe these cells, which foster attention and impulse
control, do not function properly in children with AD/HD.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
When researchers at Hadassah-Hebrew University Medical Center in
Jerusalem began looking at IL-1 genes, they found a significant number
of children with AD/HD carried a particular sequence. This raises the
possibility that genetic differences in the immune system may lead to
childhood AD/HD.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There are many [interleukins] in the immune system," said one of the
researchers. "So it's possible this mechanism is very complex. But this
study suggests we are looking in the right direction for the problem."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers say if AD/HD is found to be a genetic disorder, it may be
possible to treat it with gene therapy, by loading "correct" IL-1 genes
into a harmless virus and then infecting fetuses in the womb, as their
brains are developing. However, they stress the link between the immune
system and AD/HD would need much more scientific proof before such an
approach would be tried.

Foe turned friend: Canadian and other researchers revive hopes
for safe gene therapy using HIV

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The virus that causes AIDS has been re-engineered by a team of
Canadian and U.S. scientists to cure genetic disease. The scientists say
they have corrected sickle-cell disease in mice by taking HIV virus,
gutting it, and then stuffing it with the genetic material needed to
cure the disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The work, detailed today in the journal Science, is being described as
a major breakthrough that renews faith that gene therapy will eventually
cure human disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"I've been a skeptic," says co-author Dr. James Ellis, a senior
scientist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. "But this is
convincing demonstration that gene therapy can work in animals."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Until a few years ago, gene therapy was hailed as the best way to cure
genetic diseases. A wide range of ailments, from cystic fibrosis to
cancer, are linked to gene mutations. Once the genes associated with the
disorder were identified, scientists believed it would be relatively
easy to find a way to introduce the correct genes and fix the
conditions.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But instead of leading to quick cures, gene therapy has been plagued
with problems. Perhaps the most tragic involved Jesse Gelsinger, an
18-year-old from Arizona, who died in 1999 when his lungs shut down
after he was given a massive dose of a modified cold virus, which was
intended to ferry healthy genes to his cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gelsinger was not particularly sick when he agreed to give gene
therapy a whirl. He suffered from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency,
a rare metabolic disorder he was able to control with a low-protein diet
and drugs. He had decided to take part in the experiment at the
University of Pennsylvania to help others who were more severely
affected. Shortly after doctors infused Gelsinger with weakened cold
viruses carrying repair genes, he developed a high fever, slipped into a
coma and died.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After Gelsinger's death, U.S. health officials discovered at least six
other unreported deaths involving gene therapy. The deaths led to the
curtailment of human trials, which have been running far ahead of the
science. It turns out many of the so-called "gene therapies" had never
been shown to work in animals, let alone people. Researchers were
advised to stop trying unproven treatments on people and urged to get
back to basics: find viral vectors (neutered viruses that ferry new
genes into cells) that were safe and would not trigger fevers or
disease; and prove the vectors could deliver genes that would function
properly once inside cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The task has proven much harder than originally expected. Only certain
viral vectors appear capable of delivering new genes to target cells.
The repair kit needs to include not just the desired gene but also
mechanisms to turn it on and to produce the right amount of proteins.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
You need to insert a "cassette" of genetic instructions, says Dr.
Ellis, whose Toronto team designed the control mechanisms used to turn
on the replacement gene used in the sickle-cell experiments.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While it may sound diabolical to use HIV to help treat disease,
scientists say the virus's uncanny ability to sneak into cells is
enabling them to deliver replacement genes as never before.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We're turning a foe into a friend," says collaborator Dr. Keith
Humphries, at the Terry Fox Laboratory in Vancouver. He says using HIV
was the turning point in a decades-long search for a way to repair the
genes that cause sickle- cell disease, one of the world's leading
genetic disorders.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"HIV will carry things other viruses simply spit out," he says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The scientists stress the HIV vectors are "neutered" and gutted so
they cannot reproduce or or cause disease. "These things can't even
reproduce on their own," Dr. Humphries says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Sickle-cell disease, a serious and often fatal blood disorder, is
common in individuals of African, Mediterranean, Indian, and Middle
Eastern descent. It occurs when someone inherits the sickle-cell
mutation from both parents. Their body manufactures an abnormal version
of hemoglobin in their red blood cells that distort into the telltale
sickle shape. The sickled cells can get stuck in blood vessels and block
blood flow, leading to anemia, stroke and organ damage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The mutation responsible for sickle-cell disease was first discovered
in the 1950s and has long been recognized as a promising candidate for
gene repair.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But the task proved daunting. The "replacement part" is relatively
large and proved difficult to transport and control inside cells. Dr.
Humphries and colleagues Dr. Connie Eaves in Vancouver, Dr. Ellis in
Toronto and a dozen others in Boston and Paris decided to join forces.
The team, led by Philippe Leboulch of the Harvard Medical School and
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have worked together for years
and the scientists are thrilled to have finally come up with a repair
mechanism that works beatifically in mice and looks promising for
humans.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We're smiling," Dr. Humphries says.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers created mice with sickle-cell anemia. Then they
designed a gene to counteract the flawed genes in the mice and loaded
the genetic cargo into a neutered HIV vector. Unlike less invasive
viruses, HIV can readily sneak into non-dividing cells and get through
the nuclear membranes. (As if using HIV were not strange enough, gene
therapy researchers at the University of Pennsylvania are trying to fuse
HIV with Ebola virus to create a gene therapy vector to treat cystic
fibrosis.) The HIV vector ferried the anti-sickling gene variant to bone
marrow cells that had been taken from diseased mice. The gene
incorporated itself into the stem cells that are found in blood marrow
and give rise to red blood cells. The altered bone marrow cells were
then transplanted back into the mice, which had had their remaining bone
marrow destroyed by radiation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The new gene was rapidly expressed in 99% of circulating red blood
cells, preventing sickling and other signs of the disease. Ten months
after transplantation, the stem cells with the new genes were still
generating healthy blood cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gene repair worked in two different mouse models. There was an
eightfold reduction in sickled cells in one set of mice and elimination
of sickled cells in the second. Other side effects of sickle-cell
disease -- spleen enlargement, a urine concentration defect, and
dehydration of red blood cells -- were also corrected in the mice.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"They were basically cured," says Dr. Humphries, who speculates such
gene repair would offer "life-long" cure if it could be made to work in
people.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The Vancouver team is now trying to repair diseased human bone marrow
cells in the test tube and will implant them into mice to see if they
function properly. They also hope to start trails on other animals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers are optimistic that HIV vectors will be safe for use
in humans. But they stress the need for research to ensure the vectors
could never recombine to take on any of the deadly characteristics of
HIV.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After the earlier controversy over gene therapy, scientists are
proceeding cautiously. They are reluctant to predict when gene repair
could be tried in humans, saying much depends on the outcome of the
current phase of animal research.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"But there are real grounds for optimism," Dr. Humphries says.

Genetic therapy to replace doping?

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Erica Bulman LAUSANNE, Switzerland -- The International Olympic Committee
on Monday braced itself for the onset of a problem more formidable and
dangerous than doping: genetic modification of athletes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Meeting with some of the world's leading genetic experts, representatives
of the IOC medical commission examined the potential impact of gene
therapy in sport and the ethical implications of genetically modifying
athletes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Major advancements have been made recently in the field of gene therapy,
which involves injecting the body with new genes that produce therapeutic
proteins meant to block disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technique -- still in the experimental stage -- is designed to treat,
cure or prevent disease. But authorities fear some will try to use gene
therapy to secure a competitive edge.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"There is an important mutation on the horizon," said Prince Alexandre de
Merode, chairman of the IOC's medical commission. "The application of gene
therapy is not feasible today and we know of no cases of abuse yet, but it
could become as important and widespread a problem as traditional doping
in sport."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Embryos
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Relating it only to sport, the experts defined gene therapy as the
"transfer of genetic material to humans for the treatment or prevention of
diseases or disorders." However, the definition applied only to
non-permanent modification of a person's body that will not transfer to
offspring.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The group did not delve into the possibility of altering embryos in the
womb to engineer designer athletes, a potential problem experts imagine
happening only in the distant future.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Currently there aren't even any gene therapy medicines that are approved
worldwide for any human use; these gene therapy medicines are now only
being developed," de Merode said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"So to come up with an individual completely different to others, who can
run much faster, be the man or woman of the century -- it won't come
tomorrow, but maybe 10 to 20 years' time," he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Among the procedures under consideration to ferret out genetic cheats is
the detection of antigens -- or the presence of antibodies generated in
the blood as a result of gene therapy use. Other methods include scanning
and analysing footprints of genes, or protein in blood and saliva.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists agreed that gene therapy medicines -- and their possible abuse
by athletes -- could be expected in three to five years.

Researchers take step toward silencing flawed genes: Therapeutic
benefits

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
PARIS - German scientists say they have taken a step toward gene
silencing, the ability to block the action of specific genes in humans
that could eventually have immense therapeutic benefits.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Flawed genes are the cause of an array of inherited diseases, from
Alzheimer's and types of cancer to cystic fibrosis, and it is one of
medicine's great goals to find ways of stopping them from working in
order to brake the spread of the ailment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Great excitement was generated a few years ago by a ground-breaking
technique that "silenced" specific genes in laboratory plants and
insects but, disappointingly, failed to work on lab mammals.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technique entails making a molecular strand of chemicals that is
an exact match for the targeted gene sequence, and introducing it into
a cell. Enzymes in the cell then break this double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
into smaller pieces called short interfering RNA (siRNAs).
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In ways that remain hazy, these siRNAs then break up the gene's
messenger RNA that matches their own sequence. Messenger RNA is the
gopher of DNA, playing among other things a vital role in creating
proteins, the body's essential unit.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Successful in the fruit fly Drosophila and its tiny laboratory pal the
nematode worm, dsRNA has sadly had the effect of a nuclear bomb when
used on mammal cells, closing down the cell's entire protein production
rather than targeting specific genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A team of scientists led by Thomas Tuschl, a cellular biochemist at
the Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry in Goettingen, say
they have sidestepped this catastrophic response by using siRNA strands
rather than dsRNA, the British weekly Nature reports.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Their idea is that these shorter pieces can creep in stealthily to
work on the complex DNA of mammal cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tuschl took a range of mammal cells, including human embryonic kidney
tissue and Chinese hamster tissue, and introduced into them a gene for
luciferase, the enzyme that gives fireflies their eerie glow. Luciferase
genes are frequently used by biotech engineers, as they give a simple
visual indication as to whether the gene is operational or not.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The siRNA introduced into these cells was able to reduce the
functioning of the luciferase gene, although it was not silenced
totally, as has been the case in lab plants and insects.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
However, Tuschl went on to prove that his siRNAs were also effective
at targeting several naturally occurring, rather than transplanted,
genes in these cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Brenda Bass, a biochemist at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City,
said the technique, if refined, had enormous potential.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene silencing techniques have had "a huge impact in studies of
non-mammalian systems," she said. "Use of siRNA in mammalian cells could
be just as far-reaching, with the applications extending to functional
genomics and therapeutics."

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Boston -- And, though the findings announced Monday at a San Francisco conference were preliminary, supporters of gene therapy saw them as part of a welcome trend. It's at least the third report in the past year of small successes with gene therapy, which previously has disappointed despite hundreds of experiments over the past 20 years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These are the first positive results from a trial of gene therapy for hemophilia A," which causes abnormal bleeding in about 13,500 Americans, said Dr. David Roth of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, the principal investigator. The safety trial in a small number of patients is sponsored by Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. of Cambridge.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy is a relatively new arm of medicine in which copies of normal genes are used to replace or compensate for malfunctioning genes in the patient.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The announcement came yesterday from the Canada Foundation for Innovation (CFI), which handed out a total of $363 million to 59 universities, colleges, hospitals, and not-for-profit research institutions across Canada.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMaster was awarded $9.6 million to build and equip its Centre for Molecular Medicine and Health. McMaster president Peter George predicts the research centre will become a world leader.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Jack Gauldie, chairman of pathology and molecular medicine, said the work includes looking at how gene therapy can be used to treat diseases such as cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Molecular investigation in medicine is a recognition that we need to move to more basic levels to understand the problems associated with disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is an institute that will have both basic investigation as well as clinical investigation.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In true McMaster fashion, this is bench to bedside research -- laboratory to patient research."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMaster will investigate a wide variety of approaches to putting new molecular and genetic discoveries into practice to fight disease. In gene therapy, genes are used like drugs to fire up the immune system.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The new building, which was rejected for federal funding last year, will be adjacent to and integrated with the health sciences centre and the life sciences centre.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gauldie said the size, complexity and specifics of the structure are still to be determined.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It will be a significant addition to the existing capacity for research at McMaster."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The Canada Foundation provides 40 per cent of the project cost. McMaster anticipates getting a matching amount from the provincial government, through the Ontario Innovation Trust, and the university is responsible for raising the remaining 20 per cent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMaster's second-biggest award from the CFI was $5.2 million for biomolecular research.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">With the contributions from the province and McMaster, the total will be almost $13 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">This initiative also will have a major impact on the development of new drugs and new approaches to therapeutic intervention in diseases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Brian McCarry, professor of chemistry, said about a third of the money will be used for research lab space, and two-thirds for equipment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is going to look at the interaction of proteins and DNA with small molecules. It's a drug discovery approach."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McCarry said it will bring chemistry and biochemistry techniques together to solve common research problems. "(The CFI) funded us for every penny we asked for. This is very unusual, so they clearly saw the value of this."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMaster will receive $2.6 million for information technology and communications research, another university priority. The balance of the funding is split among three smaller projects.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George, the university president, is jubilant about the announcement. "It's a brilliant result and we're very happy."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMaster is in sixth place on the CFI funding list for universities.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're a much smaller institution than most of them, so in per capita terms, adjusted by size, we have done extremely well."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McGill University topped the list with about $61 million.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">George noted that McMaster faculty were involved in five successful joint funding applications, including one from St. Joseph's Hospital. St. Joseph's will get about $2.7 million to study the neurobiology of stress, mood and anxiety disorders.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's fabulous news for the community," said hospital executive vice-president Kevin Smith.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The money will be used to purchase a type of magnetic resonance imaging machine. Smith said it will enable the hospital "to take a snapshot of the brain" as it is working. "You can introduce a stimulus, a drug ... and then watch how the brain reacts to that," he explained.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's also very helpful for looking at blood flow."  </p>

<div>772 words</div><div>28 April 2000</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>C04</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2000 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New York -- The work involved three babies who could not grow complete immune systems. The only other treatment for the condition, a form of severe combined immune deficiency, is a bone marrow transplant, which works just 60 per cent of the time. Otherwise, patients must live in germ-free bubbles or fall prey to the ever-present microorganisms that most people easily fend off.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health and Science: F10  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a report of the work, to be released in today's issue of the journal Science, Dr. Alain Fischer, a professor of pediatric immunology at the Hospital Necker-Enfants Malades in Paris and his colleagues describe the course of two of the babies, ages 11 months and 8 months at the time of treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Three months after their gene therapy, the researchers recounted, the babies were home from the hospital, living like any other children. Ten months later, their immune systems were normal. Ordinarily, infants born with SCID (pronounced like skid), die before their first birthdays unless they remain in a germ-free environments.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a footnote, the researchers said they had successfully treated a third baby, who was a month old at the time. In a telephone interview, Fischer said he had since treated two more babies and was waiting to learn whether the effort succeeded with them as well.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are very happy and the families are very happy," Fischer said. "It is a success today. Then the next question is, 'How long will it be a success?' It may be that after some time there will be a decline in these cells and that sooner or later we will have to treat them again. We hope that if this happens it will not be for a very long time."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy experts were exuberant.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a very exciting study," said Dr. R. Michael Blaese, who was a member of a medical team at the National Institutes of Health that attempted the first gene therapy on a human patient nearly 10 years ago.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Blaese, now the head of the human therapeutics division at ValiGen in Newtown, Pa., added: "This would probably be the first example in any disease where gene therapy could be a fully successful treatment. You can't distinguish these patients from normal."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The success comes after a tumultuous decade in which, according to the National Institutes of Health, more than 390 gene therapy studies were initiated, involving more than 4,000 patients and more than a dozen medical conditions.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While those doing the research always expressed confidence in its promise, critics said many of the companies formed to capitalize on the technology exaggerated preliminary data in hopes of raising capital.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, at times, some scientists promised more than the technology was ready to deliver, leaving the field a target for accusations that patients were being endangered by reckless experiments that were doomed to failure.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The babies treated by Fischer had a rare disorder known as severe combined immunodeficiency-X1, or SCID-X1, which almost exclusively affects boys, occurring once in every 75,000 live male births. It is caused by mutations that destroy the function of a gene that is needed to make T cells, a class of white blood cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In a sense, the condition is a perfect target for gene therapy. With scid-X1, the cells that need a new gene are readily accessible in the bone marrow, which is relatively easy to remove from the body.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even better, if functioning genes actually get into the marrow cells of patients with SCID-X1, those genetically corrected cells will proliferate and displace cells with the defective gene. That is because, as the body tries to grow a complete immune system, it sends waves of chemical signals to the bone marrow to stimulate it into providing T cells. T cells with the defective gene start to grow and then die.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Any cells with a functioning gene will be fuelled by the body's hormones and will grow rapidly to populate the bone marrow.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Fischer said he began working on gene therapy for SCID-X1 in 1993, as soon as the missing gene was identified.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He studied the treatment in mice and in the laboratory, attempting to insert the gene into patients' cells for six years before trying to treat patients.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last year, he said, he decided "there was a serious chance that the treatment could work in this particular disease," and the success with the first babies was the result.  </p>

Another blow delivered to experimental gene therapy

Los Angeles Times
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
WASHINGTON -- In yet another blow to experimental gene therapy, the Food
and Drug Administration said yesterday that it has launched an
investigation into whether trials at two research centres accidentally
exposed young cancer patients to the viruses that cause AIDS and Hepatitis
C.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The agency also suspended the studies for the treatment of children with
brain cancer at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tenn.,
and Baylor College of Medicine in Houston.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We are taking this very seriously," said one FDA official who requested
anonymity.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The agency is conducting its own tests on samples of gene-based medicine,
which uses a special virus known as an adenovirus to transmit the
engineered genes. At issue is whether this virus somehow became
contaminated, either through manufacturing or in the laboratory.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers at St. Jude apparently learned through independent testing of
the possible problem and notified the FDA Feb. 4.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The families of the children treated were to have been notified within
the last several days but an FDA official said that none of the patients
yet "has been tested for HIV, as far as I know."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He added: "We are very concerned about the potential impact of this news
on parents and families and are working to ensure that they are informed
as quickly as possible."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The children were being treated for neuroblastoma, a brain cancer. The
experiment involved removing a patient's own cancer cells, modifying them
with an immune system gene and then inserting them back into the patient
to try to stimulate the immune system to attack the cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Many of the children since have died of cancer, the researchers said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a statement issued yesterday, St. Jude said "there is no evidence that
any of the children who were treated were harmed in any way by the
vaccine."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A Baylor spokeswoman said that the contaminated samples apparently came
from St. Jude and that none had been found in the therapy administered to
children at Baylor.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The FDA stressed that the findings were preliminary and that the
sensitivity of the test used -- known as polymerase chain reaction or PCR
-- often produces "false positive" results.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy researchers, working at what is widely regarded as the
cutting edge of treatment for many disorders, attempt to replace or repair
damaged or missing genes with healthy ones. Hundreds of gene therapy
studies are currently under way, treating nearly 3,000 patients.

Gene therapy blamed in young man's death September fatality first of its

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
PHILADELPHIA -- In a setback for one of the most exciting fields of
medical research, investigators confirmed a young man who died during a
gene-therapy experiment in September was killed by the treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The preliminary report on the death of Jesse Gelsinger of Tucson, Ariz.,
found an infusion of corrective genes, encased in a weakened cold virus,
triggered an extreme immune-system reaction that caused multiple organ
failure, said James Wilson, director of the University of Pennsylvania
Institute for Human Gene Therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gelsinger, 18, is believed to be the first person to die as a direct
result of gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The case has stirred debate over using patients in gene-therapy
experiments who are not close to death. Gelsinger had a severe gene
disorder controlled by drugs and diet but was relatively healthy when he
began the therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition, the results could delay experiments that use viruses to
transport the corrective genes into the body -- currently the most common
treatment method.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"People say: 'I have a disease and I want gene therapy. I don't care
about the risks,' " bioethicist Arthur Caplan of the University of
Pennsylvania said yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"Then someone dies and everyone says: 'How could you let this happen?'
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"It will slow it for a while, then the pressures will build again and it
will get going even faster."
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gelsinger died Sept. 17, four days after researchers injected the
modified cold virus and engineered genes into an artery leading into his
liver. He suffered from ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency, a genetic
disorder that leaves the body unable to produce enzymes that remove
ammonia from the body. Ammonia is a byproduct of protein processing.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Most victims of the rare disorder die as infants. Gelsinger had a mild
form that he kept in check with medications and low-protein foods.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Researchers said they still do not understand precisely why Gelsinger
died. Seventeen other patients had been through the procedure without ill
effects; and none of the studies on animals indicated that there would be
an immune reaction such as the one that killed Gelsinger, Wilson said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The preliminary investigation suggests that the cold virus should not be
injected into the bloodstream or liver the way it was done in Gelsinger's
case, Wilson said. But it has caused no problems in some other patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gelsinger's father, Paul, has said his son knew there was a chance he
could die from participating in the study but he accepted the odds because
he wanted to help himself and others.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LONDON -- "This is obviously going to open up the debate again in the field of germline gene therapy," said Norman Nevin, chairman of Britain's Gene Therapy Advisory Committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Eileen Utterson, vice-president of Chromos Molecular Systems of Burnaby, B.C., announced the achievement at a London biotechnology conference earlier this week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's the first time an artificial chromosome has ever been shown to be inherited in any mammal," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Utterson said the company planned to use the technology, which does not interfere with the cell's own genetic machinery, to create genetically modified animals with milk containing pharmaceuticals.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">She insisted it will be tightly regulated and will not be used for human germline gene therapy, which means breeding in or out particular characteristics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We are in control of the technology, and we don't want to engage in germline gene therapy," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists routinely create transgenic animals, where genes have been altered, for research purposes. Gene therapy in humans involves introducing a specific gene to target cells to fix a defect such as cystic fibrosis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Because it is so difficult, gene therapy is usually restricted to a less risky procedure of adding therapeutic genes to specific tissue so it can be taken up by enough cells to correct the problem. Any changes are not passed on to offspring.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"However, if genes could be ferried into embryos in an artificial chromosome that would safely be inherited without interfering with the rest of the genome, which is the collection of all genes, germline therapy might not be so risky," New Scientist said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Chromos's experiments with mice suggest that this should be possible," it added.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Chromos said it was working on human artificial chromosomes that could be used for conventional gene therapy. Japanese and American scientists have also created synthetic miniature human chromosomes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In an editorial, New Scientist said artificial chromosomes could change attitudes about gene therapy and genetically engineered embryos. Some scientists already believe genetically engineered embryos are the best way to deal with some inherited diseases.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"In polls, a sizable minority consistently says it would accept genetic engineering for the treatment of serious illnesses. If artificial chromosomes really can be made safe, their invention could nudge more people this way," the magazine said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It would be a mistake to expect the taboo on human genetic engineering to last forever," it added.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">WASHINGTON -- "To our surprise, this technique nearly completely reversed" the effects of aging on a group of key brain cells that had shrunk in elderly Rhesus monkeys, said Dr. Mark H. Tuszynski of the University of California, San Diego.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Tuszynski is senior author of a study appearing today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The studies reinforce a new understanding of how the brain ages and suggest that neurons in the older brain don't die at first, but go into shrunken atrophy, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We've all heard the dogma that we lose 10,000 neurons a day after the age of 20," Tuszynski said. "Well, that is false. That doesn't happen."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">An actual count of the cells in the cortex, a key area in the thinking part of the brain, shows that very few cells are lost with age, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">CONTROL NEURONS  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Instead, he said, his team found it was control neurons in another part of the brain, called the basal forebrain, that were most dramatically affected by aging. These cells, Tuszynski said, had shrunk in size and had stopped making some regulatory chemicals, a change that seriously affects the thinking cortex.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"These cells are like the air traffic controllers of the brain," the researcher said. "They are on the ground, deeper in the brain, controlling the activities of cells up there in the cortex. They control the flow of information in the cortex."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers found that about 40 per cent of the basal forebrain cells could not be detected in old monkeys, and the other 60 per cent had shrunk in size by 10 per cent.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cells were not dead, Tuszynski said. By inserting genes for nerve growth factor, or NGF, into the brain, he said, the cells were revived and restored to nearly full vigour.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We restored the number of cells we could detect to about 92 per cent of normal for a young monkey and size of the cells was restored to within 3 per cent," he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">It isn't known yet if the restored cells also reinvigorated the old monkeys' thinking and memory, but that is now being tested in another group of old monkeys, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the therapy is so promising the researchers applied in June to the Food and Drug Administration to test the gene therapy technique in humans with Alzheimer's disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If the FDA gives its approval, NGF genes will be injected into the brains of Alzheimer's patients to see if they will restore some cognitive powers gradually destroyed by the disease, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Alzheimer's disease does not occur in animals exactly the same as it does in humans, Tuszynski said, so the only way to test the gene therapy technique is in human patients. The early trials, called Phase I, would involve only a small number to determine safety. It could be years before the technique's full value is proven, Tuszynski said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">REVERSIBLE  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Bradley Wise of the National Institute of Aging said the study is important because it suggests that "the decline in the numbers and size of neurons with aging may be reversible."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"A lot of studies have been done in rats in this area, but this is a step forward because it used primates (Rhesus monkeys)," Wise said. However, he cautioned that "a lot of work will have to be done," including determining how long the gene treatment lasts, before the technique could be used routinely in humans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In their experiment, the University of California, San Diego, researchers used eight monkeys with an average age of 23, the monkey equivalent of the late 60s to 70s in humans.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Skin cells were taken from each of the monkeys. Into these cells, the researchers inserted a gene that makes human nerve growth factor, an essential chemical found in the brain. The modified cells were then injected into the forebrain of four of the monkeys. Four others, acting as controls, got injections of skin cells without the NGF gene.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once in the brain, the modified cells began making NGF.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">After three months, the researchers examined the brains of the eight monkeys. The control monkeys showed a brain cell loss expected for animals their age. But the brains of the monkeys with the NGF genes injections had an almost youthful appearance, Tuszynski said.  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The drug is so far only available to patients whose cancer has spread to other parts of their body.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Andrew Arnold, head of medical oncology at the Hamilton Regional Cancer Centre, said breast cancer that has spread is incurable, but very treatable.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He has been involved in the clinical trials with Herceptin for about five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of his patients, Sharon Ihrig, is a living testament to Herceptin's value. She was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1991 and underwent a lumpectomy, chemotherapy, and radiation treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But the cancer continued to spread - through her bones, then her pelvis and her lower back. In 1996, Arnold invited her to participate in the Herceptin trials.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The 12 participants were all in very advanced stages of cancer; only two are still alive. Ihrig is one of them.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"My experience with Herceptin has always been good," she said. "I think it's great (that it's now available for use.) I know how it's helped me. I feel fine."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ihrig has now been on the drug for almost three years, with no side effects. Her two teenagers don't seem to worry as much.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Health Canada's approval will probably mean she'll be able to get treatment closer to her St. Catharines home; she has always had to make a weekly trip to the Hamilton clinic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Brian Leyland-Jones, chair of oncology at McGill University, describes Herceptin as a change in paradigm.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"At the end of the last century the only treatment for breast cancer was surgery. At the beginning of this century, we had radiation therapy, and in the '40s and '50s, chemotherapy was brought in.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This represents the very first biological therapy in breast cancer. It is the first drug in 40 years that has produced improved survival in advanced breast cancer with basically no side effects and that's why it's so exciting."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herceptin, or trastuzumab, is best used in conjunction with chemotherapy drugs. In some cases, women suffered heart failure when using the two drugs. Doctors believe Herceptin may be the cause.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Used alone, the most common side effects of Herceptin are chills and fever after the first injection.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Leyland-Jones said one patient likened taking Herceptin alone to taking water. "There's basically no side effects from it at all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"When it's combined with chemotherapy you get the same side effects that you get with chemotherapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"And yet it adds survival benefits without any increase in toxicity."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Patients on Herceptin will take it indefinitely, or until doctors have discovered how long it needs to be taken. Intravenous injections are administered once a week for 15 to 30 minutes, although trials are now being conducted to see if the drug can be given once every three weeks.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">About one-third of patients who have breast cancer have an overproduction of a protein called the human epidermal growth factor receptor-2, or HER2, on their cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Every normal cell has two copies of a gene that produces the HER2 protein; some cancer patients have an overproduction of this protein on their cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Patients who test positive for HER2 carry a particularly poor prognosis without treatment," Arnold said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Doctors have long been aware that some types of breast cancer progress more rapidly than others. About 10 years ago, the HER2 protein was discovered to be a problem in most of the patients who died within a short time of being diagnosed with cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A biotechnology company, Genentech, was then able to develop an antibody that knocks out the breast cancer cells to allow the patient to better respond to chemotherapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Only about 15 people in a hundred benefit from Herceptin by itself. If it wasn't so effective with chemotherapy drugs, it wouldn't have been developed at all.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The main point, Arnold said, is that people live longer if they receive Herceptin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think it's important for the future," he continued. "If it works in advanced breast cancer, what happens if we use it earlier on?"  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For now, North American trials have only begun to study the effects of Herceptin on patients with early-stage breast cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Cancer Care Ontario has agreed to fully fund only those women who test positive for HER2, who are in advanced stages of breast cancer, and who have tried at least two forms of chemotherapy to no avail.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is going to be one of the most expensive new drugs ever introduced," Arnold explained. Therapy costs about $2,700 per month.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Herceptin has been available in the U.S. for about nine months, but Arnold said only those with good insurance policies can afford it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I think the guidelines that are being published in Ontario are designed to make sure the people who need the drug get it, and that limited resources don't get used up in funding the drug inappropriately."  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">LEXINGTON, KY. -- "What we're trying to do is to correct the genetic defects that allow cancer cells to grow out of control and produce tumours," said Dr. Holly Gallion, an obstetrician-gynecologist at the university who is the principal investigator on the study.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">TWO-YEAR STUDY  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university plans to enrol about 12 women in the two-year study. All will get standard surgery and chemotherapy treatments. But half also will receive a solution containing millions of healthy copies of the so-called "p53" gene.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">When it works properly, the p53 gene suppresses cell growth and prevents tumours. But when the gene is faulty, cell growth runs wild, leading to various kinds of cancers, including ovarian cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers hope that, by replacing defective p53 genes, they can slow the growth of ovarian cancer tumours and improve survival rates for victims.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">If trials go well, the treatment could be approved for general use within about five years, they said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Someday, researchers think, genetic therapies -- combined with surgery and chemotherapy -- might offer a cure for ovarian cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Surgery and chemotherapy now are the standard treatments, and they work if ovarian cancer is caught early. But, since the disease has only vague symptoms, three out of four cases have spread by the time of diagnosis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gallion said that only about 20 per cent of women with advanced disease are still alive after five years.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ovarian cancer kills roughly 14,500 American women and 1,500 Canadian women annually. About 2,500 new cases are diagnosed in Canada each year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's clearly really important that we have other ways to help these women," Gallion said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One key challenge in gene therapy is getting healthy genes into cancer cells where they can work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">University of Kentucky researchers hope to do that by using a common cold virus as a "bus" to carry healthy p53 genes into the cancerous cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Healthy p53 genes will be inserted into the cold virus, which has been modified so that it cannot reproduce. Introduced into a cancer patient's body, the virus will naturally invade cancerous cells, taking the healthy genes along with it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Inside the cancer cell, the healthy genes should start to override the effects of the defective p53 genes already present, slowing the cancer's growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The goal is to try and convert cancer cells back to a more normal physiology," said pharmacist Daniel Wermeling, director of the Kentucky Center for Clinical Research and Investigator Services.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">According to Gallion, ovarian cancer is an ideal candidate for gene therapy since it usually remains in the abdominal area. That means doctors will be able to concentrate large amounts of genetic material at the site of the disease, she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The genes will be introduced through a small catheter about once a month for five consecutive days, along with standard therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Side effects should be slight, because genetic material is not toxic, university officials said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Early trials using the p53 gene have been promising in slowing cancer growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you look at the cells under a microscope after treatment, they really can look like normal cells," Gallion said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gallion and Wermeling cautioned, however, that while researchers hope gene therapies one day will lead to a cure -- or a prevention -- for ovarian cancer, that day is still in the future.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">And, Gallion noted that only about 10 per cent of ovarian cancers are caused by inherited defective genes. The rest occur at random, usually in women over 50.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We really don't know," she said, "why women get ovarian cancer."  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Even though the proposal received one of the highest ratings for scientific content and technical expertise, it was rejected by the Canadian Foundation for Innovation, an independent agency endowed with $800 million in federal funds for scientific research.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The decision by the agency also puts in jeopardy $13 million in matching provincial money that was to fund additional personnel and projects at the centre. McMaster is committed to provide the remaining $4 million to $5 million of the $30 million project.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">At the very least, the centre has been delayed by as much as two years, said Dr. Jack Gauldie, director of the gene therapeutics initiative and chairman of the department of pathology and molecular medicine at McMaster.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the worst-case scenario, Gauldie said there's a danger the centre may have to relocate. In fact, Gauldie said there has already been interest expressed from other places.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It's a major blow," Gauldie said. "We're in a bit of limbo at the moment. We have to regroup and retarget ourselves to figure out how we are going to put the building in place in order for the expansion to occur.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The province has seen this as a very high priority and wants to put money into the operational part of it.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But the federal funding authority seems to think we don't need the building," he added, "and, of course, we need it desperately."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">To Gauldie, this is another example of Canada's lack of commitment to research funding, which makes this country less attractive for top-notch scientists.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"The federal government must awaken to the fact that it has to commit the monies to research, otherwise we keep sliding backwards," Gauldie said. "We've become a Third World science country."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university can re-apply for the next round of grants, but those won't be determined until next September. In the meantime, the search will begin for private funding.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It was designated as our highest priority," said Dr. Gerhard Gerber, vice-president of research and international affairs at McMaster University. "It has an impact on a number of initiatives which have had major investments already made.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Clearly, it's going to happen. It will just happen on a modified time scale."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The university has also asked for an explanation why the proposal was rejected despite the fact it was held in high regard.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We're one of the foremost places in the country carrying out this work," Gauldie said. "It isn't quite clear why we did not receive the support.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I suspect that the only recourse will be something of a political nature, which I doubt will have much success. Somebody has taken a decision and is not likely to backtrack."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapeutics is a medical field still in its infancy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The idea is to develop products that will introduce new genes into the body to bring about specific actions for short periods of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Unlike gene therapies that would permanently alter the genetic makeup of a person, a gene therapeutic would only be taken for one or two weeks, much like an antibiotic.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some of the gene therapeutics being developed at McMaster are ready to be tested in clinical trials early next year.  </p>

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Washington -- Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said old mice gained 27 per cent of the muscle lost to age when they were injected with a gene that prompts muscle-cell growth.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For younger mice, the gain was about 15 per cent, said Dr. H. Lee Sweeney, the study's senior author.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Before the technique is ready for humans, however, there are both ethical and safety questions to be resolved, Sweeney said. For athletes, he said, the injections could be the "perfect performance-enhancer."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You build muscle mass and strength even without exercise. And it is not detectable in the blood."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Olympic athletes are routinely tested for drugs that artificially improve strength and performance. Most such drugs are now outlawed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The safety issue arises because the same gene that causes muscles to grow can also cause the overgrowth of unwanted cells.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Abnormal growth could be a health risk. For instance, you wouldn't want your heart to grow larger."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Nonetheless, the experimental gene therapy offers the promise of correcting one of the major problems of aging -- muscle feebleness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some experts estimate humans lose 10 per cent of their muscle strength and mass each decade after the age of 50. Weakness from old age can cause falls, broken bones and loss of the ability to walk or care for oneself.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The gene therapy will next be tested on rabbits and then on monkeys. Even if those studies go smoothly, it will be at least two years before the gene therapy is ready for human experiments.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
DALLAS - INSERTING GENES into patients' heart muscle has caused it to
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
grow new blood vessels that can restore the organ to new life in much
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
the way a bypass does for a less-sick heart, researchers said
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The procedure involved inserting the gene for a protein called
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
vascular endothelial growth factor or VEGF directly into patients'
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
blood-starved heart muscle, Dr. Jeffrey Isner, professor of medicine
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
at Tufts University School of Medicine in Boston, told the American
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Heart Association meeting.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
VEGF encourages growth of a network of tiny blood vessels in a process
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
called angiogenesis. Those who underwent the procedure had blocked
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
coronary arteries, reducing the blood flow to the heart muscle.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This reduction caused chest pain called angina every time the patients
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
exerted themselves, calling on their hearts for more effort.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While Isner and others termed the results preliminary, he said they
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
are very encouraged.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Floyd Stokes, 58, a DeLeon, Texas, peanut farmer, received the gene
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
May 26.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
He had bypass surgery after a heart attack in 1989, but he never felt
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
top notch after that, he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
After a second heart attack in September 1997, he did not know where
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
to turn, but then his wife Jean read about Isner's work. Isner had
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
begun his gene therapy experiments in legs with blocked arteries, but
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
he was awaiting approval to move to the heart.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stokes waited with him. The gene insertion, made through a tiny
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
incision in the chest, left him only a little sore.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Three weeks later, Stokes awoke and told his wife, ``I feel better
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
than I have in 15 years.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
From being a pickup truck farmer, he has returned to strenuous labour,
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
he said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Stokes is one of 16 patients who has undergone the gene therapy
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
insertion, but Isner said as many as 250,000 patients each year have
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
inadequate blood flow to the heart and cannot undergo bypass surgery
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
or balloon procedures to open their coronary arteries.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
All 16 patients had one to three heart attacks. Eleven had undergone a
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
balloon procedure and 15 at least one bypass procedure. The average
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
number of such surgeries was two, Isner said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The small incision in the chest and the injection of the gene took
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
about one hour in the operating room, said Isner. Most patients left
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
the hospital in three or four days.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Tests demonstrated the gene was causing heart muscle cells to make
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
VEGF for at least two weeks, long enough to encourage growth of new
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
blood vessels, Isner said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Prior to the procedure, all the patients could not walk more than 100
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
feet and could not work because of excruciating chest pain.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Six of the 11 patients studied for at least three months have no chest

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
pain.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Ottawa -- Twelve years ago, Doctor Ronald Worton and his team at Toronto's Hospital for Sick Children discovered the gene linked to Duchenne muscular dystrophy. And it could be another dozen years or more before they find a way to correct the genetic flaw that leads to the incurable, muscle-wasting disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, as far as one of the world's leading geneticists is aware, "there has been no successful gene therapy done in humans, ever.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There have been lots of attempts for different diseases, different genes," said Worton, now chief of research at the Ottawa General Hospital and professor of medicine at the University of Ottawa.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"But nothing yet that would be considered to be a cure."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers still believe gene therapy could be to 21st-century medicine what vaccines were to this century. And its greatest potential may not be in the treatment of rare, genetic diseases, but in much more common killers such as cancer. But huge hurdles remain, and some experts say it is time for a reality check.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"Our enthusiasm for something that would turn the tide for people who are desperately ill clouded the thinking of almost all of us," said Dr. Doris Zallen, a former member of the United States government's recombinant DNA advisory committee.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">From 1992 to 1996, Zallen's group reviewed and approved some 160 gene therapy experiments in the United States. So far, she said, the success "has been far less than everybody hoped for."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Yet gene therapy has been so oversold by researchers, private investors and the media that some people wrongly believe that "cures" for genetic diseases already exist, said Zallen, who recently published a book on genetic testing called Does It Run in the Family?  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I interviewed a lot of people who had the opportunity to have genetic testing and I was struck by the number of people who said they didn't need genetic testing because there was gene therapy," Zallen said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"They had been misled by all of the articles and all of the enthusiasm in the press to assume there was gene therapy the way there's antibiotic therapy."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In fact, researchers are finding that correcting a bad gene is nothing like killing a germ.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For more than a decade, scientists have been furiously isolating and decoding the more than 100,000 genes that make up the human genome. (Genes carry the information that determines our physical characteristics passed down from parent to child. Genes produce essential proteins that, when missing or defective in some way, can cause disease.)  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers have isolated the genetic flaws that cause inherited breast cancer, colon cancer, cystic fibrosis, obesity, alcoholism, aging -- even a rare form of baldness.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Find the defective gene, the theory has gone, and you may be able to find a way to fix it, either with drugs or by putting a good gene into the body.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"There was a bit of a cowboy attitude of, 'Oh, it's easy, we'll just shoot genes into tissues and the genes will function and take over and correct the defects,"' Worton said. "In fact, it's not that simple at all."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">One of the biggest problems has been finding a way to get the genes into enough cells. Worton uses the example of trying to use gene therapy to treat cystic fibrosis.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"You're dealing with millions of millions of cells lining the lungs. You've got to get your gene copy into many of those cells. One or two per cent isn't going to do it."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Once the gene is inside the cells, the next problem is getting the gene to produce, or express, the missing protein -- and to keep producing it for long periods of time.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers also still have to find the most effective way to get the genes into the target cells. A number of groups, including researchers at McMaster University, are using adenoviruses, the common cold virus, as genetic moving vans, or so-called vectors.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">McMaster's Dr. Robin Parks has developed a vector that uses a completely disabled cold virus to deliver foreign DNA into the body. That approach appears to be overcoming problems with first-generation vectors, which still had snippets of viral genes that caused the body to launch an immune response that interfered with the gene's work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Another type of gene therapy involves not so much replacing a defective gene as using genes to treat diseases, such as cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Some researchers are putting genes into tumour cells that produce a protein that appears to make the cells more sensitive to drugs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers at McMaster are using their adenovirus vectors to get proteins into tumours in lab animals that can boost the body's immune response.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But gene therapy research is still in its early days, said Worton. And no one can predict which diseases may be the first to benefit.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Last fall, United States scientists reported that they had used a viral vector to deliver good copies of the muscular dystrophy gene into mice with the disease.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">But "muscular dystrophy is going to be a really difficult one because there is so much muscle in the body that you have to get the genes in to," Worton said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He, too, believes it is important people understand the limits of gene therapy.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Worton and others still believe gene therapy will be a significant part of medicine in the 21st century.  </p>

Molecular biology is providing hope where chemotherapy has
disappointed
By Leigh Hopper
Cox News Service
AUSTIN, TEXAS - On Jan. 21, 72-year-old Jean DeVito of Houston
underwent abdominal surgery to have a recurrent ovarian cancer removed
and to have two small catheters implanted. Seven days later, a
solution containing a modified virus was poured into the abdomen
through the catheters to coat any remaining ovarian cancer cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
DeVito was turned to her left, then to the right, helping the fluid
swish around her abdominal cavity. With that simple motion, she
entered a new world of cancer treatment in which molecular biology is
providing hope where chemotherapy has disappointed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It's ''the first trickle of a tidal wave,'' said Timothy Thompson,
professor of urology and cell biology at Houston's Baylor College of
Medicine. Thompson, who is developing ways to treat prostate cancer
using the same gene-bearing virus, predicted: ''This is going to be
the future of medicine.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Ovarian cancer researchers at Baylor and at Houston's Methodist
Hospital are studying for the first time how so-called gene therapy,
surgery and chemotherapy might all be combined to treat recurrent
disease. The approach has cured mice with ovarian tumors. Ovarian
cancer is so aggressive that mice with untreated disease died in less
than a month. But the mice that received gene therapy were alive six
months later and found to be free of cancer.
''That's very, very encouraging. We're not just talking about the
response that influences the tumour 'somewhat' but we're talking about
curing animals that should have been dead after 20 days,'' said Dirk
Kieback, DeVito's doctor and an associate professor of obstetrics and
gynecology at Baylor. Ovarian cancer affects one in 75 women and
accounts for more deaths than any other gynecological cancer in women,
Kieback said. About 36,000 women die from ovarian cancer each year.
One reason it's so deadly is that ovarian cancer is difficult to
detect at an early stage. Symptoms are vague or nonexistent. By the
time it is found, the cancer has spread beyond the ovaries and the
abdomen may be filled with tiny tumors, like rice scattered in a wet
sack.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
While ovarian cancer usually stays in the abdomen rather than
spreading to organs, the number of nodules and their small size make
it hard to surgically remove each one. The cancer is notoriously
resistant to many key chemotherapy drugs. The cancer kills the person
as tiny tumors grow into bigger ones, siphoning off blood and
nutrients from the rest of the body, enveloping the intestines and
obstructing bowel function.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
But some of these very traits - the fact that the cancer usually stays
in the abdomen, and that the tumors start out scattered and small -
may mean this type of cancer is ideally suited to therapy with
gene-bearing viruses.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In gene therapy, the injected viruses zero in on cancer cells, which
happen to be particularly receptive to the virus. Each virus is
carrying a gene that makes the cancer cells susceptible to a drug
circulating in the bloodstream.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
THE GENE sets up a microscopic factory within the cancer cell,
converting the drug, acyclovir, into acyclovir monophosphate. This is
further metabolized by the tumour cell, creating a toxin that kills
the cell. By this mechanism, the cell commits ''suicide,'' which is
why this form of gene therapy is also dubbed suicide gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The toxin bleeds over into adjacent cells, killing them as well. The
''factory'' dies with the cell, so the patient experiences no
permanent genetic change.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In this scenario, the virus-infused solution can reach all of the
tumors. The tumors' small size increases the ratio of surface area to
volume, meaning enough genes can penetrate enough exterior cancer
cells to kill the tumour.

manufacturing facility in California from Lynx Therapeutics Inc. for
about $11 million in cash and stock.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Inex shares (IEX/TSE) jumped 10% on the news yesterday, to close at
$5.50, up 50 cents.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Shares in Hayward, Calif.-based Lynx (LYNX/NASDAQ) closed unchanged at
US$17.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Inex will pay US$3 million in cash plus 1.2 million shares for the
package.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The deal will add about $2 million to the company's annual operating
costs and trigger a 20% jump in its spending on research and
development, it said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Inex specializes in gene therapy and technologies for delivering drugs
to specific sites within the body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The acquisition will give it rights to several drugs in the antisense
field, a subsector of gene therapy.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
"We intend to develop our own antisense drugs with assets acquired
from Lynx, while continuing our ongoing partnering initiatives with
other developers of gene-based products," said chief executive James
Miller.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Inex acquires LR-3280, an antisense therapy already in phase 2
clinical trials for the treatment of restenosis, a narrowing of the
arteries after heart surgery.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Lynx had already signed up partners Schwarz Pharma AG and Tanabe
Seiyaku Co. Ltd. to develop and market the drug.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Under the terms of the deal, Inex will be eligible for up to US$8.5
million in milestone payments, which are triggered by such things as
progress through clinical trials, Miller said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Included in the package are the rights to some leukemia and brain
cancer treatments in the early stages of clinical trials.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Seven members of Lynx's scientific staff will join Inex and will be
based at the newly acquired facility in Hayward.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The plant is capable of producing antisense drugs in sufficient
quantities to meet commercial demand, Inex said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Orlando, Fla. -- So far, doctors from Boston have tried the gene therapy on people with dangerously clogged arteries in the legs, where it seems to have spared some from threatened amputations.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">For several years, scientists have talked about manipulating genes to cure a variety of human ills. But until now, there has been little firm evidence that it will do any good.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is the first time that any gene therapy has been shown to be clinically successful," said Dr. Jeffrey Isner of St. Elizabeth's Medical Centre in Boston.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Reports by Isner and another team working on a different gene therapy approach were presented yesterday at a meeting of the American Heart Association. If their promising but preliminary findings stand up to more rigorous testing, gene therapy may someday prove to be an important way to control heart disease, the biggest killer in North America.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"This is opening a door to genetic therapy in cardiovascular disease," said Dr. Valentin Fuster of Mount Sinai Medical Centre in New York City, incoming president of the heart association.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">So far, 20 patients with severely clogged arteries in their legs have received injections of laboratory-made versions of the human gene that makes vascular endothelial growth factor, a protein that prompts blood vessel development in the womb.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Of these, Isner said 16 have responded by growing new blood vessels that carry blood around the blockages.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said he has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for permission to start the therapy on patients with blockages in their hearts, which biologically are virtually identical to clogged leg arteries. He hopes to begin those experiments by early next year.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Drs. Michael Mann and Victor J. Dzau of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston are using gene therapy to try to make traditional bypass surgery work better.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Over time, about half of the blood vessels used to reroute blood in the heart or the legs also become clogged. Their goal is to alter the grafts genetically so this does not happen.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The doctors said they hoped to try the same procedure in coronary bypass operations within the next year.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
CANADA'S TOP heart doctors are in Winnipeg this week for a five-day
major medical conference on heart disease and its treatment.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
More than 2,000 cardiac specialists from Halifax to Vancouver are here
until Thursday to discuss everything from a potential cure for some
heart disease with gene therapy to new coronary drugs and surgical
techniques.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Heart disease is the leading cause of death among Canadians,
accounting for 79,000 deaths from heart attacks and strokes every
year.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The conference is sponsored by the Canadian Cardiovascular Society,
the research and medical arm of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of
Canada.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Winnipeg researcher Dr. Lorrie Kirshenbaum is to be given the Young
Investigator award at the conference Tuesday in recognition of his
work on the genetic causes of heart disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Recognized as one of Canada's medical research stars, Kirshenbaum has
a five-year $250,000 grant from the Heart and Stroke Foundation. He
will study the role of a tumour-suppressor protein in cell death
related to heart disease at his laboratory in the Institute of
Cardiovascular Sciences of the St. Boniface General Hospital Research
Foundation.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The work holds promise for gene therapy where doctors may someday
inject genes into heart tissue to prevent heart disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other developments to be released at the conference include studies
about a new drug by multinational drug maker Smith-Kline Beecham to
combat congestive heart failure, and a warning women are at higher
risk for heart disease than previously believed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In addition to medical and surgical developments, the conference is
also hosting at least one session related to the Winnipeg pediatric
cardiac surgery inquest. Hearings have been ongoing for the last 18
months into the deaths of babies after open-heart surgery. Mortality
rates forced Health Sciences Centre to suspend the program in 1994.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Nurses with the Variety Heart Centre, who once referred children to
HSC for surgery, have been transferring children out of province for
surgery since 1994. They are to discuss their experience at a session
Tuesday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Efforts to pool resources to make a formal regional pediatric cardiac
prairie program, with surgery based in Edmonton, have been under
discussion since the Winnipeg program closed.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the society which represents
cardiologists, cardiac surgeons and heart researchers across Canada.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Winnipeg was chosen for the meeting because it hosted the group's
first convention in 1947.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other cardiac-related professional societies for nurses,
technologists, perfusionists, who run heart-lung machines in
open-heart surgery, and rehabilitation specialists are holding
meetings at the same time.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"It is a particularly horrifying thought," said Dr. Vivienne Nathanson, head of science and ethics for the BMA.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If you were a dictator somewhere in the world and you wanted to get rid of a group of people in your population who were opposing you -- whether you are talking about Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda, Bosnian Serbs or 1930s Germany -- you could use this," she said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Gene therapy homes in on genes that certain people have that are different and can cause disease. For example, people with cystic fibrosis have easily identified mutations, as do some sufferers of breast cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">New genes, or therapeutic proteins, can be delivered using engineered DNA -- the basic genetic building material.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">A race war would not be possible -- races are too genetically diverse and what people recognize as "race" has little genetic basis. Instead, what can be targeted smaller groups that have genetic similarity.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Genes targeted by such weapons could control a person's appearance -- height or hair colour -- or how their bodies process certain drugs.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"If that is the case, and it is likely to be the case, then it is possible to say we may have a weapon which was a virus or a chemical compound which has a genetic targeting component," Nathanson said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Such compounds could be delivered as a gas or spray, or put into the water supply. They could kill, make people infertile or cause the birth of deformed children.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Philadelphia -- Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials. Nevertheless, "a treatment based on the new strategy ... may have the potential to benefit many patients," the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Individuals with the disease have a non-working version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the study at the University's Institute for Human Gene Therapy, researchers altered a common-cold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The virus, which also was altered to minimize its susceptibility to the immune system, was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the experiment, between 30 to 40 per cent of the muscle fibres in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing.  </p>

Gene therapies offer hope against range of ailments

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GENE THERAPY is an experimental science to correct defective genes
that cause disease by replacing them with healthy genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Scientists are still learning how to get the good genes inside the
cell and have them stay there as a permanent part of a person's DNA.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Three leaders in genetics research who visited Winnipeg recently
included:
n  Dr. Michael Blaese, chief of the clinical gene therapy branch of
the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. He was one of two
doctors who gave a dying girl a second shot at life in 1993.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In a painless procedure, Blaese gave the child who was born with no
immunity to disease the one thing she needed. It was an infusion of
genetically altered T-cells with the enzyme compound she lacked at
birth.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The disease is called severe chronic immunodeficiency syndrome (SCID)
and it is caused by a variety of genetic deficiencies but in this
girl, the problem was the absence of adenosine demainese - the ADA
gene. Without it white blood cells self-destruct, leaving the body
without protection from foreign intruders. The syndrome was
immortalized in song by Paul Simon and in a Hollywood movie The Boy in
in the Bubble, the life of David who was born without an immune system
and lived inside a bubble scientists made for him.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Blaese's teacher was one of David's doctors in Houston and it was the
sight of this boy who never felt the touch of a human hand that
motivated Blaese into genetic research.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
David died after a failed bone-marrow transplant at age 13.
''Mother Nature has been working on this problem for several million
years. We've only been working a few years,'' Blaese told University
of Manitoba graduate students in medical and genetic research.
n  Frank Graham is a biologist on a research team at McMaster
University in Hamilton that is using Interleukin 2, 4 and 12 in
experiments to cure breast cancer in mice. About half the animals
treated by injection have gone into complete and permanent remission.
The gene therapy involves using an adenovirus - so common that they
are responsible for most colds.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The part that causes infection is removed at the same time that
scientists plug genetically altered anti-tumour cells directly into
the DNA of the mice. The shots appear to act like a vaccine against
certain tumours. The mice who were cured died of old age.
n  Dr. Michael Hayden, a medical geneticist at the University of
British Columbia, is using gene therapy in an effort to stop a form of
brain tumour that grows so fast it generally kills its victims within
a year. By using different types of viruses as carriers of genetically
altered material, Hayden hopes to inject the new genes directly into
the tumour and let them gobble it up until it disappears. The genetic
material would stop eating once it reached the margins of the tumour,
leaving healthy tissue intact.

WASHINGTON - AN experiment in three HIV patients has shown for the
first time that gene manipulation can protect immune system cells from
infection by the virus that causes AIDS, researchers say.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The experimental therapy at the University of Michigan involved
inserting altered genes into white blood cells from HIV patients,
expanding the number of the altered cells in the laboratory and then
injecting the cells back into the patients.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A report on the research is to be published today in the Proceedings
of the National Academy of Sciences.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Dr. Gary Nabel, professor at the University of Michigan Medical
Centre, said the work showed for the first time in clinical studies
that gene therapy can be used to prolong the survival of CD4 T-cells,
the white blood cells that are the primary target of HIV, the virus
that causes AIDS.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In the study, Nabel and his colleagues targeted an HIV gene called REV
which is essential for the reproduction of the virus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers drew blood from three HIV patients and then separated
from that blood the CD4 T-cells that are attacked by the virus. One of
two altered genes were then inserted using gold micro particles as the
transfer mechanism.

TORONTO - SCIENTISTS racing to discover ways to combat AIDS are

Special delivery in gene therapy
</b>
</div><div class="author">
Victoria Griffith Financial Times of London

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In an early gene therapy trial last year, scientists at the US
National Institutes of Health observed a disturbing reaction in
one of their cystic fibrosis patients. The patient, who had
received gene treatment for the disease through a ''crippled''
virus - one that has been distorted to destroy its infectious
potential - reacted with chest inflation, fever, headache and low
blood pressure.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Although the patient did not become seriously ill, the incident
raised a red flag in the fledgling gene therapy industry.
Scientists feared the patient had reacted not to the gene itself
but to the viral ''vector'' - the package in which the gene was
delivered.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Since then, the sector has focused on gene delivery mechanisms as
the key to making gene therapy commercially available. ''This is
our holy grail,'' says Marc Schneebaum, chief financial officer
for Genetic Therapy, a prominent gene therapy company. ''If we
could solve the delivery challenge, this industry would take
off.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy has attracted growing attention since 1990 when
scientists first used the technology to cure ADA syndrome - an
inherited failure of the immune system to develop, sometimes known
as ''bubble boy'' disease.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The goal of gene therapy is simple: to treat diseases by correcting
the genetic makeup of defective cells. At least 35 gene therapy
treatments are in trials in the US. However, they face tremendous
challenges in coming to market.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Placing genetic material into cells can be a herculean task. Even
viral vectors, the most cunning of all delivery systems at
squeezing through cell walls, reach their targets less than 20% of
the time. Of that 20%, just 10% of the genetic material makes it
inside the nucleus.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
''In some cases, delivery is more difficult than {scientists} had
originally expected,'' says Douglas Armstrong, chief executive of
Aastrom Biosciences. Because of their talent for invading cells,
viral vectors became an early favourite of gene therapy
scientists. But viruses are dangerous substances. Even when
crippled they may be recognised as an intruder by the immune
system.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In some cases, the crippled virus may simply be killed by the body,
rendering the gene therapy treatment inside the viral envelope
ineffective. In other cases, the immunological response may cause
inflammation and other symptoms. Scientists also fear a worse
scenario - that the virus may reform and re-activate itself inside
the patient.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Other challenges abound in gene therapy. Scientists are still
wrestling with targeting issues - getting the genetic material to
enter only the desired cells. If the genetic code gets into the
wrong cells, the patient may become seriously ill. Even when the
material reaches the right place, there is a chance the gene could
interfere with the healthy mechanisms in the cell, or cause the
cell to start dividing rapidly, in a cancer-causing reaction.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A further question is control of the therapy once it is in the
body. Scientists may succeed in getting cells to manufacture
insulin in diabetic patients, but they want to ensure they can
control the dosage.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Companies are working on a number of approaches to the gene
delivery dilemma. To target cells better, scientists at companies
such as Genetic Therapy and Viagene have been working on
perfecting molecules on the surface of vectors to bind only with
target cells, rather like jigsaw puzzle pieces.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
To exert better control over gene treatment, Viagene is working on
a kamikaze mechanism. ''If we inject a certain chemical into the
patient, we may be able to convert the cells altered by genetic
therapy to toxic form,'' says Robert Abbott, chief executive of
the group, ''They would then essentially self-destruct.''
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The type of vector used in gene therapy is vital. Since the
problems with viral envelopes emerged, scientists have struggled
to make crippled viruses innocuous. Genzyme is trying to find a
way to disguise the virus to prevent an immune reaction by the
body.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Another approach is to create lipid envelopes to carry genes. This
approach has become increasingly popular in the past two years.
However, lipids are notoriously ineffective - less than 5% of the
treatment is likely to make it to the genes - and they may be
harmful.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
One gene therapy company, Applied Therapeutics, is trying to create
the best of both worlds by using a lipid studded with viral
proteins. Vical is collaborating with Merck on the injection of
naked DNA strands into patients. The method avoids any negative
vector effect. Like lipids, however, delivery to cells is
tremendously inefficient. DNA injection, moreover, can only be
used in specific instances, such as for injection into tumours.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The method that may be closest to market is ''ex vivo'' gene
therapy - extracting human cells for treatment before replacing
them in the body. It works best for blood-borne illnesses such as
haemophilia, Aids and leukaemia, and is also being used to
''immunise'' patients against the toxicity of chemotherapy in
cancer treatment. The method is expensive and does not work for
all diseases, but may yield the first commercial products in the
field. It is the only proven gene therapy treatment in the field
so far, having been used by French Anderson at the NIH to treat
bubble boy syndrome in two girls in 1990.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
In March, Genetic Therapy obtained an exclusive licence to an NIH
patent on ex vivo treatment. While the licence does not prevent
other companies conducting research in this area, any corporation
bringing an ex vivo product to market would have to make an
agreement with GTI. With gene therapy companies promising
treatments for everything from cystic fibrosis to cancer, the
stakes are high in a race to find safe and reliable delivery
mechanisms. Over the next few years, however, it is unlikely any
one method will prevail.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">NEW YORK -- Lungs clogged  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In cystic fibrosis, the lungs are clogged by a sticky mucus that leads to fatal infections. The disease is caused by a faulty gene. Gene therapy is aimed at delivering a working copy of this gene to the lungs, but scientists use nasal tissue for initial experiments because it is more accessible.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the new work, working copies of the gene were attached to the bubbles and sprayed repeatedly into the noses of nine patients. The gene was sucessfully implanted in at least seven patients and found to be active in five.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Researchers found that the procedure partially corrected an abnormality in an electrical charge that is seen in tissue from cystic fibrosis patients, but the effect disappeared within a week.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers, mostly from London and Edinburgh, report the work in the January issue of the journal Nature Medicine. They said the procedure probably needs improvement before it could be useful as a treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The work represents the first time the gene has been delivered to the nasal passages of patients without using a virus, and "I think that's a very important milestone," said Robert Beall, president of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation in Bethesda, Md.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The bubbles, called liposomes, may provoke less of an immune system response than viruses, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Scientists are also trying to create viruses that avoid this problem, he said. The concern is that the immune system might attack cells that take up the gene, interfering with the therapy.  </p>

YOKOHAMA, JAPAN - The youngest people in fected with AIDS will be
among the first to receive its most dramatic new treatment - genetic
manipulation that arms blood cells with a virus-killing protein,
researchers said yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The fact that scientists would even consider tinkering with the

</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Doctors would remove blood from the umbilical cord that connected the
baby to its mother. The blood contains stem cells, which ordinarily
live in the bone marrow and make new blood cells.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Next, they give these stem cells a new gene, one isolated from a virus
that infects tobacco plants. This gene produces an enzyme called a
hairpin ribozyme. It destroys the RNA that HIV uses for its own genes.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The gene-altered stem cells are injected into the baby, where they
continue to make white blood cells containing the ribozyme gene. If
one of these new cells is attacked by the AIDS virus, the gene would
prevent it from becoming established.

SAN DIEGO - Scientists say they may have made a break through in
fighting brain cancer.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The researchers at the University of California at San Diego reported
yesterday that they used genetically engineered cells to eradicate
brain tumors in laboratory rats and prevent the tumors from growing
back.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The technique apparently acted as a vaccine to stimulate an immune

glioblastoma that almost always recurs and is almost always fatal, the
researchers said.

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The procedure is similar to one that has been used elsewhere in trials
to treat people with the tumors.
''We are excited about this finding because it offers the chance that
the immune system can be harnessed to fight brain cancer,'' Dr. David

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">PHILADELPHIA -- "I feel much better in the sense that I can do more physical activities now, such as skiing and dancing," the seamstress and part-time bank teller said Thursday. "I was limited before."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman asked to remain anonymous.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"We have demonstrated the long-term safety and efficacy of gene therapy in this patient," said Dr. James Wilson, head of the Institute for Human Gene Therapy at the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"By so doing, we have opened the doors for the potential of gene therapy in treating various forms of inherited, lethal disorders."  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The findings are reported in the latest issue of the journal Nature Genetics.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the gene therapy described, defective genes in human cells are replaced with properly functioning genes.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman suffers from a lethal inherited disease called familial hypercholesterolemia. In it, a defective gene stops the liver from removing a type of harmful cholesterol from the blood.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Too much of the cholesterol can build up and cause severe heart problems.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman had a heart attack at age 16 and a coronary bypass at 26. Two of her brothers had the disease and died of heart attacks in their 20s.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I had nothing to lose," the woman said of the experimental treatment.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Both her parents have the disease, and her nine-year-old daughter appears to have it. Her parents are still alive.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In the gene therapy treatment, begun in June 1992, Dr. Wilson's team removed 10 per cent of the woman's liver.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Using a virus into which a normal version of the gene had been spliced, researchers inserted the gene into cells in the removed liver portion, then injected the cells into a vein leading to the woman's remaining liver.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Incidents of the disease are unusually high in Quebec, where its roots are traced to early 18th century French immigrants, said the woman's Canadian physician, Dr. Paul Lupien.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Wilson said the woman's cholesterol level fell by 25 to 30 per cent within five months after the start of the therapy. The level had been five times higher than normal before the treatment began.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The woman will need medical supervision for the rest of her life to ensure the permanently inserted genes continue to work.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">"I am certainly going to live to 90 years of age, and more, possibly," the Quebec woman said.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In announcing the grant yesterday at McMaster's Health Sciences Centre, London Life president Gordon Cunningham said, 'We hope the work being undertaken here will have a profound impact, giving future generations of Canadian women a chance at a full and healthy life.'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">Dr. Gauldie said the goal of the research he will be doing, with doctors Frank Graham and William Muller, is to turn cells from breast cancer tumors into vaccines that will stimulate the body's immune system and prevent the metastatic, or spreading, phase of breast cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">'The metastatic phase is the dangerous part,' Dr. Gauldie said. 'We want to convert the body's response into one that will recognize, fight and kill cancer. The body does this for many things, but not for solid tumors.'  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">He said results of the research should be applicable to any solid tumor cancers, such as melanoma, lung cancer and gastro-intestinal cancer.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">The researchers believe that, by using a previously-studied benign virus to transfer cytokine genes -- small proteins that modify the body's immune response -- into the body of a breast cancer patient, the effect of a vaccine will be achieved.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">They plan to explore the method using a breast cancer model, developed by Dr. Muller, that will allow the researchers to manipulate metastasis in mice, and then stimulate the immune system to fight the cancer, he said.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">While the gene therapy would not prevent breast cancer, it would provide a way to halt its progress once diagnosed.  </p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">In that way, Dr. Gauldie said, it is similar to the experimental interleukin-2 treatment received by former Quebec premier Robert Bourassa for melanoma.  </p>

<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
GENEVA - There could be a cure for hemophilia, using gene therapy, by
the year 2000, the World Health Organization predicted yesterday.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Gene therapy is the insertion into cells of a synthetic, normal gene
to replace the defective one that causes hemophilia.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Hemophiliacs' blood cannot clot properly so if they cut themselves
badly they may bleed to death without a speedy transfusion of blood
products containing clotting factors.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
It effects 100,000 to 350,000 males worldwide.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
The UN agency said the conclusion that a cure was ''within reach'' was
made after three-day talks in Geneva by international experts.
''The first cases of cure of the disease through the technique of gene
therapy will be achieved, given essential further developments, by the
end of the decade, the experts predict,'' the WHO said in a statement.
''Their predictions for the first gene therapy cures for the disorder
are based on their assessments of the latest scientific progress in
the field,'' it added.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
Research is being carried out mainly in Britain, the United States and
Japan, the agency said.
</p>
<p class="articleParagraph enarticleParagraph">
A cure would also remove the risk to hemophiliacs of contacting AIDS
after blood transfusions. More than 1,000 Canadians, many of whom are
hemophiliacs, contracted the virus that leads to AIDS after getting
contaminated blood products in the 1980s.
