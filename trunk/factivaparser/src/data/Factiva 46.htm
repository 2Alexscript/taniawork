</p>
<p>If, as some researchers suspect, the H1N1 virus is poised for a new wave of infection this fall, it's imperative that governments get the lines of communication as open as they can be.</p>
<p>People are going to have questions. If those questions go unanswered, there will be many unnecessary visits to clinics and doctors' offices, and a lot of unnecessary stress. Rumours and misinformation will rush to fill even the smallest gap in public education.</p>
<p>The fact that information now knows no borders might, in a way, add to the confusion, since public-health recommendations in the United States and Europe can differ from the recommendations in Canada. If, for example, Canadians aren't clear on when it's appropriate to use antivirals, there could be overuse or misuse, which might lead the virus to become drug-resistant.</p>
<p>Each country is also formulating priority lists for who gets the vaccine, and those lists are not the same. Canadian officials will, therefore, have to work all the harder to make this country's strategy and guidelines clear.</p>
<p>On a local level, people need detailed, up-to-date information about such things as where and when they can get the vaccine if they are in an at-risk group. Parents need to know what's happening in schools.</p>
<p>This summer, the City of Ottawa decided it would only make spokespeople available to talk about H1N1 at weekly press conferences, and not in between. The thinking was that since the outbreak was relatively stable over the summer, restricting media interaction to press conferences would make for the most efficient use of staff. If something significant arose, the city communications staff said they would inform the media.</p>
<p>That plan might have been well-intentioned, but public information on a vital public health matter should be available for the asking at any time, rather than when government deigns it convenient. The city is revisiting its H1N1 communications policy for the fall; it would do well to have knowledgeable spokespeople available when journalists call.</p>
<p>Timing matters when it comes to getting information out during a pandemic. And if it turns out that H1N1 is having a lower impact in Ottawa than expected, the public needs to know that too. There's no point in causing economic harm -- especially during a recession -- by leading people to avoid crowds, parties, shopping malls and workplaces if there's no need to do so.</p>
<p>Of course, communication works in both directions. We're all in this together, and all Canadians have a responsibility to inform themselves and protect themselves. If you're feeling sick with flu-like symptoms, stay home from work and don't socialize. Wash your hands. Cough and sneeze into your sleeve. Eat your fruits and veggies to keep your immune system strong. Keep an eye out for friends and neighbours, especially people who might be at particular risk of developing complications if they get the flu.</p>
<p>Simple advice, maybe, but sometimes the simple things make a difference.</p>

</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>What it is: The new H1N1 flu virus is a respiratory illness that causes flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Who it affects: Youth more than other age groups. Half the people in Ottawa with swine flu have been children and teens.</p>
<p>Severity: Most cases have been mild in Ottawa.</p>
<p>How it spreads: In the same way seasonal flu does -- person to person, through coughing, sneezing, or touching contaminated objects. People can infect others from the day before their symptoms develop to seven days after they become sick.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Fever, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches, fatigue, severe headache, sore throat, lack of appetite, possible nausea, vomiting, diarrhea.</p>
<p>Severe symptoms: High fever, difficulty breathing.</p>
<p>If you have ...</p>
<p>1) mild flu-like symptoms: Stay home from work or school. Sleep, drink plenty of fluids, stay away from others. Avoid tobacco smoke, use cold compresses for comfort.</p>
<p>2) severe flu-like symptoms: go to your doctor or a hospital emergency room.</p>
<p>3) flu-like symptoms and a chronic medical condition, such as asthma, diabetes or cancer: speak to your doctor. Most people can battle the virus on their own, but people with a chronic illness might need antiviral medication early.</p>
<p>4) flu-like symptoms and are pregnant: Speak to your doctor about antiviral treatment. Pregnant women, especially those in the third trimester, are at greater risk for complications.</p>
<p>If your symptoms are moderate and you can't decide what to do: Call Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000, or the city's Public Health Call Centre at 613-580-6744.</p>
<p>Am I Better?</p>
<p>Your bout with H1N1 is over when you feel well and no longer experience symptoms, usually 24 hours after the break of a fever. If a cough lingers, it's fairly normal, and not a reason to stay home.</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>Wash hands frequently, with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.</p>
<p>Stay at least two metres away from people who have flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Carry hand sanitizer for use in crowded places.</p>
<p>Do not share things that go in the mouth.</p>
<p>Clean surfaces in your home on a daily basis.</p>
<p>If you have to cough or sneeze, cover your mouth with the inside of your elbow.</p>
<p>If the virus spreads, you might want to avoid crowds to avoid exposure.</p>
<p>Masks are not a good form of prevention because most people use them incorrectly, and contaminate themselves when they put the mask on and take it off. If you're sick, you can wear a surgical face mask to avoid exposing others, especially when you leave home. Also, caretakers should consider wearing a surgical face mask. After you take the mask off, throw it in the garbage and wash your hands.</p>
<p>Surgical face masks can be purchased at your local pharmacy, and are usually labelled "N-95," meaning that the mask has a 95-per-cent rate of filtration efficiency.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>Antivirals: Tamiflu and Relenza effectively treat the virus, but most patients recover without medication. Antivirals are best for moderate to severe cases, and people who have complications. Antivirals have been distributed to each province on a per capita basis. Prescriptions come from your doctor.</p>
<p>Vaccines: Immunization is likely to begin in November. The federal government is purchasing 50.4 million doses of H1N1 vaccine from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. Provinces and territories will be responsible for delivering the vaccines. As of yet, no decisions have been made on who will get priority for vaccines.</p>

<p>July 24</p>
<p>Countries affected: 160+</p>
<p>Deaths: 800</p>
<p>6 Mexican officials declare an alert following an outbreak of "swine flu" in the town of La Gloria. About 60 per cent of the town of 3,000 are affected.</p>
<p>13 The first recorded fatality occurs, a 39-year-old woman in Oaxaca, Mexico.</p>
<p>16 Mexico contacts Pan-American Health Organization, an arm of the World Health Organization, over the illness.</p>
<p>22 The Mexican health ministry issues a nationwide alert and samples are sent to Canada for testing.</p>
<p>23 U.S. public health officials announce that seven people in California and Texas have been diagnosed with a flu virus known as H1N1, but all seven recovered. Canadian public health authorities announce that the Mexican "swine flu" virus is the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>24 The WHO announces that around 800 suspected cases of H1N1 have been recorded in Mexico, including 60 suspected deaths. Health authorities around the world go on alert.</p>
<p>25 An emergency committee of the WHO meeting in Geneva warns that the virus has "pandemic potential." Mexico orders isolation of sick people and closes many public establishments.</p>
<p>26 Canadian officials confirm four cases of H1N1 on the country's east coast.</p>
<p>27 WHO raises its alert level from 3 to 4 on a scale of 6, meaning there is sustained human-to-human transmission of the virus causing outbreaks in at least one country and signalling a "significant increase in risk of a pandemic."</p>
<p>28 Costa Rica confirms instances of H1N1, the first country in Central America to be hit by the virus. Israel confirms its first case of swine flu, the first Middle Eastern country.</p>
<p>29 Ten New Zealand students are confirmed to have H1N1 flu after returning from a study trip to Mexico.</p>
<p>29A 23-month-old Mexican child is the first confirmed death in the United States and the first one outside Mexico. WHO raises alert level to 5, calling on countries to prepare for an "imminent" pandemic. The first cases involving people who had not visited Mexico are confirmed in the United States, Spain and Germany.</p>
<p>30 WHO adopts the term "influenza A (H1N1)" after veterinary experts say disease is not occurring among pigs.</p>
<p>30 Egypt says it intends to slaughter its entire pig population, even though no cases have been detected there and despite the WHO pronouncement that H1N1 cannot be caught from eating properly prepared pork. This leads to clashes with the Christian minority, who keep most of Egypt's 400,000 pigs.</p>
<p>30The Netherlands, Switzerland and Ireland confirm instances of the virus.</p>
<p>1 Police in Hong Kong seal off the Metropark hotel after test results on a 25-year-old Mexican man confirmed he has the virus. The WHO warns that the traditional flu vaccines have little effect against the virus.</p>
<p>2 South Korea confirms its first instance of the virus, isolating a 51-year-old woman who had returned from a trip to Mexico. France, Denmark and Italy report their first confirmed cases of H1N1. India says it is monitoring a suspected case of H1N1.</p>
<p>4 China defends its decision to quarantine 70 Mexican citizens due to fears of the H1N1 virus, despite complaints from Mexican authorities over discrimination. Portugal confirms its first case of H1N1.</p>
<p>6 A 33-year-old teacher from Texas, is the first U.S. citizen to die from H1N1.</p>
<p>8 Canada reports its first swine flu death after an autopsy shows H1N1 in the body of Tina L'Hirondelle, a 39-year-old with a history of asthma and diabetes, who died on April 28 in hospital in High Prairie in northern Alberta.</p>
<p>9A woman in her 20s is the first Australian to test positive for H1N1 but is no longer infectious. She tested positive after flying into Brisbane on a flight from Los Angeles.</p>
<p>10 Japan and Norway report their first cases. The Japanese cases are a teacher and two students who had been on a high-school trip to Ontario.</p>
<p>11 China confirms its first case of a Chinese citizen infected with H1N1.</p>
<p>12 Finland, Thailand and Cuba join the list of nations with reported cases.</p>
<p>19 A sharp rise in Japanese H1N1 cases, to 176, puts pressure on WHO to raise its alert to the highest level. Japan closes more than 1,000 schools and kindergartens.</p>
<p>20 Confirmed cases pass the 10,000 mark, with 80 confirmed deaths.</p>
<p>24 18 U.S. soldiers at a military base in Kuwait test positive for H1N1.</p>
<p>9 H1N1 pandemic is described as "very close" by a WHO official.</p>
<p>11 WHO declares a H1N1 pandemic, raising its alert to the maximum level 6. A total of 74 countries are now affected by the virus, with 27,737 cases including 141 deaths.</p>
<p>14 The first U.K. death from H1N1 is reported, the first confirmed death outside the Americas. The patient, who had underlying health problems, died at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Scotland.</p>
<p>22 The first Canadian case of swine flu that is resistant to the antiviral drug Tamiflu is reported in a 60-year-old Quebec man, age 60. It was not transmitted to anyone else. Raises a red flag but flu experts are far from pushing the panic button. Four other such isolated case were reported earlier in Japan, Denmark and Hong Kong.</p>
<p>24 The WHO reveals that "160 out of 193 WHO member states now have cases, so we are nearing almost 100 per cent but not quite yet." It says the pandemic have resulted in around 800 deaths, with the United States, Argentina and Mexico the three countries to have recorded the highest number of fatalities. The WHO finds, from data from Canada, Chile, Japan, Britain and the U.S., that the majority of cases are occurring "in younger people, with the median age reported to be 12 to 17 years." Those 60 and older appear to have more resistance to the virus.</p>
<p>27 The WHO says that more than 20 countries and overseas territories have first lab-confirmed cases of H1N1. These include holiday destinations such as the Seychelles, Turks and Caicos, St. Kitts and Nevis, Netherlands Antilles, Belize and France's Reunion Island, as well as isolated spots such as Tonga and American Samoa in the Pacific and the Solomon Islands in the Indian Ocean. H1N1 also found its way to Bhutan in the Himalayas and Andorra, an independent state tucked between Spain and France. Conflict-ridden Afghanistan and Sudan have also had their first confirmed infections.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Plan set but work continues; Critics say greater sense of urgency and national health 'czar' needed</b>
</div><div>Andrew Mayeda   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1096 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>When the second wave of the swine-flu outbreak lands this fall, Canadian public health officials will be armed with a national pandemic plan that's been years in the making.</p>
<p>Insiders say Canada is better prepared than it was during the 2003 SARS outbreak, which triggered a major overhaul of how the country responds to health emergencies.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada, created in the wake of SARS, has drafted a 550-page national pandemic influenza plan that makes recommendations on everything from how doctors should diagnose the virus and how researchers should collect and test lab samples to what temperature should be maintained at temporary morgues.</p>
<p>But critics say crucial parts of the plan remain vague. In a recent editorial, the Canadian Medical Association Journal (CMAJ) called for a greater "sense of urgency" about the second wave of the outbreak, and made a number of proposals to improve Canada's response, including the appointment of an independent national public-health "czar."</p>
<p>The easiest way to create such a position, according to the CMAJ, would be to expand the powers of Canada's chief public health officer. Currently, the chief public health officer largely plays an advisory role to the federal health minister, as well as to provincial health authorities and the public. But in a pandemic, Canada needs someone in charge who has the independence to rise above politics, and the authority to compel the provinces to take action, said CMAJ editor-in-chief Paul Hébert.</p>
<p>"First and foremost, you need an authority figure to manage the crisis, like in any crisis. You need a general," Hébert said in an interview.</p>
<p>PHAC insists it has the situation under control.</p>
<p>Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones told the House of Common health committee this month that PHAC's work could be compared to a duck moving smoothly across a pond with its legs furiously paddling beneath the water. "There's an incredible amount of work going on."</p>
<p>More details about the pandemic plan should become clear next month. On Sept. 2, Butler-Jones will start two days of meetings in Winnipeg with provincial public health officials, intensive-care specialists and medical experts. Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq will meet with the provincial and territorial health ministers on Sept. 18 in the same city. Here's what we know so far:</p>
<p>n Under a long-term contract with drug giant <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> (GSK), Canada has reserved enough vaccine to immunize the entire population. (For more on the vaccine, see page B7.)</p>
<p>But concerns are growing the vaccine won't be ready in time. The government has said it will be available in November, but some experts predict the outbreak could be in full swing by then.</p>
<p>"It's coming a little late, to be honest, because the first peak sounds like it will be in November-December. Ideally, you'd want to vaccinate six weeks ahead of that," said Hébert.</p>
<p>Until the vaccine is ready, health authorities hope the use of antiviral drugs such as Tamiflu will keep the virus at bay. The government has a stockpile of more than 50 million doses of antivirals, but that wouldn't be enough to treat the entire population, since several doses are prescribed with every treatment.</p>
<p>n The pandemic plan recommends a number of strategies to make room for flu patients, such as cutting down on non-critical surgeries, encouraging residential care, or moving non-flu patients to extended-care or psychiatric facilities.</p>
<p>PHAC estimates a pandemic could cause 15 to 35 per cent of the population to fall clinically ill, requiring the hospitalization of 34,000 to 138,000 people. Officials say such volumes could overwhelm hospitals and put the entire health-care system under stress.</p>
<p>"It wouldn't take much, given the way it's affecting people, to overwhelm the system," said Hébert, noting the virus appears to affect fewer people than the seasonal flu, but in a more "devastating" way. "It's becoming an (intensive-care unit) epidemic."</p>
<p>As the pandemic progresses, federal authorities could recommend calling up retired or part-time health-care workers, as well as volunteers from organizations such as the Red Cross.</p>
<p>n Frontline health-care workers say the flow of information from public health authorities has improved since SARS, but some worry there will be a shortage of supplies such as masks.</p>
<p>When the swine-flu outbreak started this spring, family practices had trouble getting enough high-efficiency masks for doctors and patients to wear, said Jan Kasperski, chief executive of the Ontario College of Family Physicians. "This time around, we were certainly getting good information, but we did have a few difficulties getting the supplies that we require," she said.</p>
<p>n For the moment, PHAC says "proactive" school closures aren't necessary, given the economic and social costs that would trigger. Local school boards will make the call on whether to close individual schools if an outbreak hits. (See story on page D1.)</p>
<p>The national pandemic plan notes Ottawa has the power to declare a Public Welfare Emergency under the Emergencies Act, the successor to the War Measures Act.</p>
<p>Once such a national emergency is declared, the federal government could effectively shut down schools, ban public events and assume control of emergency rooms. But the plan notes that it is unlikely that the central government would use the Emergencies Act, which has never been invoked in such a way.</p>
<p>n The outbreak will be monitored as it unfolds by the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, along with public health labs in each province and territory. By the time the second wave hits, these labs might actually have scaled down diagnostic testing, because researchers and doctors should already have a handle on the nature of the virus. Instead, the labs will likely focus on tracking the geographic spread of the disease, as well as the effectiveness of antivirals and the vaccine.</p>
<p>n In May, PHAC rolled out a public-awareness campaign that included print ads in newspapers across the country, as well as transit ads and posters at airports, reminding Canadians to wash their hands and take other precautions. The agency has also launched a website called fightflu.ca to provide updates and information to the public.</p>

<p>Allison Stuart, the senior public servant at the centre of Ontario's pandemic preparations, sighs heavily when asked what she was doing when SARS hobbled the provincial health system six years ago.</p>
<p>"You're gonna make me do this?" she says.</p>
<p>It's hard to tell if she's joking. Ontario officials have been heavily criticized for their handling of SARS, the mysterious respiratory disease that made its way into Canada in March 2003, killing 44 people.</p>
<p>"The wonder is not that the health system worked so badly during SARS," Justice Archie Campbell wrote in his commission's 1,204-page report released in early 2007, "but that it worked at all."</p>
<p>Campbell blasted the province for failing to protect doctors, nurses and other hospital employees in their workplaces. Seventy per cent of the 330 people who contracted SARS in the province were infected in a health-care setting. Two nurses and one doctor died.</p>
<p>From there, the commission's criticisms expanded.</p>
<p>"The lack of preparations against infectious disease, the decline of public health, the failure of systems that should protect nurses and paramedics and others from infection at work -- all these declines and failures went on through three successive governments of different political stripes," he wrote.</p>
<p>Stuart, who was the Ministry of Health's lead executive during SARS, remembers those troubled times well. It was her job to manage the ministry's response, then implement that plan -- or, in bureaucrat-speak, to "push that response out to" -- the health sector.</p>
<p>She said the system was utterly unprepared for the task.</p>
<p>"For many people in health, when we think of emergencies we think on an individual basis, somebody coming into an emergency room who's really, really sick, bleeding, or having a heart attack or something like that. We tended not to think of emergencies as something the health-care system would be the lead on ... as a system challenge."</p>
<p>Among the province's failings, the lack of effective communications was high on the list.</p>
<p>"We didn't have really good ways of making sure the right information was getting to the right people at the right time," Stuart says. "I remember that first night, I had a staff member who had to individually phone each hospital."</p>
<p>Stuart, who, as an acting assistant deputy minister charged with public health, is at the forefront of today's pandemic preparations, says things have changed since SARS, beginning with Ontario's first pandemic plan tabled in 2004.</p>
<p>The province has implemented a 24-hour communications cycle, which includes fixed points for daily happenings. Updates to the media, for example, are to occur daily at 3 p.m. All 36 local medical officers of health are to teleconference each day at 1 p.m. And a nightly bulletin is to be issued at midnight to ensure that in the morning, the entire health-care community has the same information.</p>
<p>"We want to provide a rhythm to communications in an emergency," Stuart explains. "We use a 24-hour clock and there are certain points on that clock that will not move. For example, if we were doing daily media updates, that happens at 3 o'clock. We work with that as a reality."</p>
<p>Dr. Arlene King, who was recently named the province's chief medical officer of health, has a different perspective. As the technical lead for the federal government when SARS hit, King was responsible for gathering information from provinces and territories and passing that on to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>It was a "challenging" task, she says.</p>
<p>In the wake of SARS, a new structure was put in place to organize all the top brass of provincial and territorial public health organizations, says King. That new public-health network has alleviated some of the confusion that occurred during SARS.</p>
<p>King now leads the Ministry of Health's executive emergency management committee, which has been given new digs in an undisclosed office building in downtown Toronto.</p>
<p>From there, a group of about 15 staff monitors the course and behaviour of a potential pandemic, gathering information and preparing the provincial response on a 24-hour basis. An executive committee with representation from various affected ministries meets there often and holds daily conference calls with a range of health agencies, including hospitals, long-term care homes, public health units, provincial labs, federal and provincial governments and other ministries.</p>
<p>"It's not the best strategy to have to introduce yourself in the middle of an emergency," says Allison Stuart, referring to the chaotic communications that occurred during SARS. "You want to have a relationship there, where you know the players. And I believe that's well-implemented now."</p>
<p>The health ministry's emergency-management committee has honed its skills during several smaller incidents over the past number of years. They include an emergency evacuation of a remote native community, a power outage in a Sudbury hospital and a suspected infectious disease outbreak on a VIA Rail train in northern Ontario.</p>
<p>"There's never going to be a point where I would say we're done," says Stuart. "But do I think we're in reasonable shape? Yes."</p>
<p>Despite the government's claims, however, there are critics who say they have not gone far enough.</p>
<p>Linda Haslam-Stroud, president of the Ontario Nurses' Association, says the initial response to the first wave of the illness in the spring exposed a range of weaknesses in the system. While acknowledging that the lines of communications have improved since SARS, she says nurses were still unclear about how H1N1 was transmitted, in much the same way as they were during the outbreak six years ago.</p>
<p>She says hospitals also failed to screen new patients upon entry.</p>
<p>"Patients shouldn't be coming into (emergency rooms) and sitting in a waiting room exposing other patients to potential H1N1," she says. "They should be screened, given the appropriate protective equipment and then isolated."</p>
<p>Haslam-Stroud says H1N1 didn't become the full-blown outbreak that was feared, but if it did, hospitals would be unable to deal with any surge of admissions.</p>
<p>Moreover, nurses feel the government is slipping when it comes to applying the precautionary principle -- or, put simply, erring on the side of caution -- trumpeted in the SARS commission report.</p>
<p>That discussion crystallized on the use of N95 masks. Rather than ensuring all front-line health care workers received the masks immediately, Ontario public health officials held a prolonged debate over their effectiveness.</p>
<p>British Columbia, on the other hand, adopted measures to reduce the risk of infection, even in the absence of clear scientific evidence.</p>
<p>Haslam-Stroud credits the province for stockpiling the masks, but says nurses at some long-term care homes didn't have access to the masks during the recent H1N1 flu outbreak, a fact she attributes to a lack of proper planning.</p>
<p>"It's been six-plus years. You would think that with all the money put into debates, discussions and consultations that we would have this totally ready to go. And I really think we're not there," she says.</p>
<p>"Nurses want to be there for their patients. However, they're not willing to put their lives and their families' lives at risk."</p>

</p>
<p>Dr. Isra Levy delivers the latest information on swine flu in his melodious South African accent, reading from a two-page text for some time. A television reporter in need of the <span class="companylink">Reader's Digest</span> version stands up and asks him just to deliver the message in his own words. A bemused Levy replies that those are his own words.</p>
<p>Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, is no master of the 10-second news clip. He doesn't boil down complex issues into a single pithy line and he still isn't comfortable with the business of being photographed hundreds of times at news conferences. He is soft-spoken.</p>
<p>But his quiet, low-key approach to running public health in Ottawa has met with success at City Hall. He is listened to carefully and has won much respect from city council members.</p>
<p>In the city's top public health job for the past year, Levy (pronounced Leevee) is the key city official in Ottawa's preparations for a swine-flu pandemic. He doesn't like to say that.</p>
<p>He would prefer for journalists and the public to know that the city's elaborate response to H1N1 is based on plans crafted years ago and a team effort, which is true. In his briefings, he regularly highlights the work of other senior public health officials.</p>
<p>But in Ontario, the medical officer of health in each municipality has enormous legal responsibility in any health crisis, especially one involving a contagious disease, including the power to shut businesses and schools.</p>
<p>As well, in Ottawa, physicians in this job have often taken leadership roles in city public debates. In fact, previous occupants of the job have sometimes clashed with council members and other community leaders.</p>
<p>Dr. David Salisbury, the last person to hold the job, grew frustrated at council's questioning of public health measures such as programs to reduce the spread of disease by handing out needles and crack-pipe equipment to drug addicts. Salisbury felt pinned in by the sound-bite political environment of City Hall and wanted the science of public health debated and controlled by a separate board of non-politicians.</p>
<p>The medical officer of health before Salisbury, Dr. Robert Cushman, upset some residents with an aggressive campaign to bring in "the gold standard" in smoking bylaws for Canada. That law, bitterly opposed by some but forcefully advocated by Cushman at the council chamber and in the media, eliminated smoking in public places such as restaurants and bars, far before other municipalities. The Ottawa experience helped pave the way for bans across the country.</p>
<p>Levy's style is something different. Certainly he is a strong public health advocate. He hasn't cut a single program in public health offered by his predecessors. But he does a lot of listening.</p>
<p>On the explosive drug-equipment issue last year, he listened to the concerns of upset city councillors and appalled residents, some of whom started patrols in their neighbourhoods to gather addicts' used needles.</p>
<p>Levy stood by the need for such programs to limit the spread of disease among addicts but he cranked up programs to recover used needles. Chris and Lisa Grinham, who last year reported that they had collected 2,000 needles in their Lowertown neighbourhood, recently posted a message on their website, Safer Ottawa, saying they were winding down their efforts.</p>
<p>"The last few months of this summer have proven to be very encouraging," they said. "It has gotten to the point that we would go days without finding any discards."</p>
<p>In an interview, Chris Grinham said he was deeply skeptical of city officials a year ago when he couldn't get a response to his e-mails and felt that the former medical officer of health, Salisbury, was dismissive of their concerns. When they called city officials to clean up drug equipment, it would take up to 48 hours for someone to arrive.</p>
<p>When Levy moved into the job he promised action. He expanded the city's efforts to collect old needles. He gave the Grinhams his personal office phone number and his cellphone number and asked for some patience. Then, the needles started to be collected -- and quickly. Chris Grinham says that needles are picked up by various city staff members -- parks maintenance, road crews, bylaw officers and the city's needle-hunter crew -- typically within 15 to 20 minutes after a call to 311. The Grinhams have only collected eight needles themselves so far this year.</p>
<p>"Isra has made good on his promise. We're very grateful for that," said Chris Grinham, noting that the city's needle hunters are "all over the neighbourhood."</p>
<p>"On needle exchange, he (Levy) listened a lot," says College Councillor Rick Chiarelli. The councillor says that some medical officers of health take on the role of health evangelists who can abide no dissent from the accepted public health line. But Levy "is respectful to all sides," willing to make changes when presented with facts or good arguments. When councillors raise a concern, "he actually goes away and thinks about it," says Chiarelli.</p>
<p>Mildly criticized at a press conference by a reporter for a lack of concrete advice for parents about swine flu, the bespectacled, greying Levy responds by saying the point was "well taken." Then he recites the key messages public health has been trying to get across to families: wash your hands frequently, sneeze and cough into your sleeve and stay home when you are ill.</p>
<p>Gloucester Southgate Councillor Diane Deans, chairwoman of the community and protective services committee, says that Levy has "far exceeded" her expectations. The city made him acting medical officer of health in 2008, then scrapped a search for a permanent appointment to the post when he performed strongly in the role.</p>
<p>Deans notes that he listens carefully to what citizens have to say and expresses appreciation to his staff for their work. He calls council members "day and night" to ensure they are kept informed about what's going on. Deans says he seems to thrive on being at the centre of the city's 730-employee (including part-time workers), $45-million public health operation.</p>
<p>"He's very diligent. He loves his job," says Deans.</p>
<p>River Councillor Maria McRae says that residents and councillors feel comfortable talking to Levy on issues ranging from speeding traffic to the feces of Canada geese. She says his "even-keeled" and "steady" approach to issues like H1N1 is a welcome antidote to the alarmism of CNN.</p>
<p>"He is one of our best kept secrets," says McRae.</p>
<p>Levy made the decision to get into public health when he was in his fourth year of medical studies in South Africa. He came from a family with a strong social conscience and said living in Africa showed him how important sanitation, clean water and shelter are to the health of a population. His first practical experience of administering public health was in a township in South Africa, where he and colleagues vaccinated the citizens against measles and polio, diseases that were still hitting that population hard in the 1980s.</p>
<p>Levy, who is 47, married his wife, Jacquie, in South Africa. They made the decision to come to Canada, rather than the United States, partly because he has a sister who lives in Toronto. In the late 1980s, Levy worked as a general practitioner in Newfoundland and Saskatchewan on a program for under-served rural communities.</p>
<p>He did epidemiology studies at the University of Ottawa and worked for the federal government and the Canadian Medical Association in health-policy posts. In 2006 he joined the city as associate medical officer of health. He enjoys keeping a hand in clinical practice, treating patients for a few hours most weeks at a clinic in the Hampton Park Plaza.</p>
<p>Levy says medicine is "a wonderful marriage of art and science," where it is important for the physician to understand not only the physical dynamics of illness and cure but who the person is and where he or she is in life.</p>
<p>Levy says his relationship with the elected council is crucial. He is interested in what city councillors have to say because it's important to be respectful but also because those councillors reflect the views of the city's general population.</p>
<p>"You're always science-based," says Levy. "But so much is about the human interaction."</p>
<p>With the current swine-flu file, Levy knows he has a very tricky issue to manage. On the one hand, he notes there is an obligation to get plans in place to deal with a pandemic that could affect a huge part of the population, threatening the lives of some. On the other hand, he must strike the right tone in his communications to the public so as not to sound panicked.</p>
<p>Levy says he doesn't want to sound like Chicken Little, the nursery tale character who said the sky was falling after an acorn fell on her head.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How scared should we be?; The majority of infectious disease experts predict H1N1 will return this fall, stronger than before. Others are more skeptical, saying this is yet another false alarm from the World Health Organization</b>
</div><div>Mohammed Adam   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>1439 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>For most infectious disease experts around the world, including Ottawa medical officer of health Dr. Isra Levy, there is no doubt swine flu will return this fall and winter. The only question is whether the H1N1 virus will mutate into a more deadly form or weaken and fizzle out. It is a guessing game, and no one knows for sure.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization, however, says by the time H1N1 runs its course, two billion people, about 30 per cent of the world population, will be infected. Millions could die. Making vaccines available quickly is critical.</p>
<p>"There is every reason to believe that when our schools and universities and other places reopen, and we've come back to our traditional flu season, the second wave of H1N1 virus will be more serious -- unless we get really lucky," says Dr. Brian Ward, a McGill University infectious disease specialist.</p>
<p>"The virus is still around and ready to explode. We are potentially looking at a very big mess," William Schaffner, a U.S. flu expert, told the Washington Post.</p>
<p>Earl Brown, a virologist and director of University of Ottawa's Emerging Pathogens Research Centre, says what experts are grappling with, as H1N1 weaves its way through the southern hemisphere, is how serious it will be when it returns to North America.</p>
<p>"Is it going to be 1918 and shake your boots or is it going to be more of the 1957 and 1968 pandemics? Right now, it looks like '57," Brown says.</p>
<p>The 1918-19 H1N1 Spanish flu killed more than 50 million people worldwide, while the 1957 avian flu took about two million lives. Given the 1957 flu is said to have had three to four times the death rate of the common flu, an H1N1 outbreak of similar intensity could kill at least 9,000 Canadians. Worldwide, the number of dead could hit two million.</p>
<p>So how scared should we be of this looming storm?</p>
<p>Really not very much, say some experts like former Ontario chief medical officer of health Dr. Richard Schabas. Despite spreading to more than 160 countries on all continents, the virus has only caused mild flu from which most people have recovered, Schabas says .</p>
<p>Relatively few have died. Indeed, since the novel virus erupted in Mexico in April, it has killed about 1,300 people worldwide, and nearly 200,000 confirmed cases in 168 countries and territories have been reported. The World Health Organization believes about one million people have been infected. In Canada, swine flu has killed 72 people and hospitalized more than 1,300 so far -- all in all not the kind of numbers that presage Armageddon, says Schabas.</p>
<p>More significantly, in southern hemisphere countries such as Australia and New Zealand, which are in the middle of their flu seasons, H1N1 has so far been relatively mild, suggesting there might not be a virulent second wave in Canada. Schabas says the WHO and most of the public health officials in Canada have handled the H1N1 outbreak badly, using harsh rhetoric and projections that often fly in the face of the evidence. He says the constant drumbeat of impending calamity only helps to fan public hysteria.</p>
<p>"They've consistently exaggerated the impact of H1N1, they've consistently exaggerated the potential impact of H1N1, and they've been intent on presenting this as some sort of impending public health disaster when the evidence has been very strong from earlier on that this is nowhere near as serious as they've been presenting it," says Schabas, now medical officer of health for Hastings and Prince Edward Counties.</p>
<p>As experts go, Schabas is in the minority. To bolster his argument, he points to several false alarms the WHO and others have sounded on the "next big pandemic."</p>
<p>Indeed, from the avian flu to SARS, experts have called it wrong time and again. In 1976, a huge scare swept through the U.S. after a young soldier died of what later turned out to be swine flu. Fearing a new "killer epidemic," government officials rushed through a massive vaccination program against the supposedly deadly flu that ended up claiming only the life of the soldier. More people actually died of complications from the vaccination than the swine flu that never was. In 2003, when SARS burst out from China, predictions of another global catastrophe filled the headlines and the airwaves. Millions could die, experts said. In the event, SARS fizzled. About 800 people died.</p>
<p>The predictions were equally dire in 2005 when the H5N1 avian flu fear gripped the world. The H5N1 virus decimated poultry around the world and there were fears that it could spread to humans. At the time, the WHO said it was only a pandemic threat, and projected that if it developed into the real thing, a low-level pandemic would claim the lives of two to seven million people. Up to 100 million could perish in a worst-case scenario. Until now, fewer than 300 have died, but H5N1 avian flu is still considered a potential pandemic threat by the WHO.</p>
<p>"We were told SARS was going to be a pandemic. It didn't happen," says Schabas. "We were told bird flu was going to be a terrible pandemic. It didn't happen. And then in April we were told to brace ourselves for the terrible wave of swine flu. It didn't happen.</p>
<p>"Now, they are saying 'brace yourselves for the terrible second wave of swine flu.' It is not going to happen. They are exaggerating the danger, basically scaring people."</p>
<p>John Herbert, executive director of the Ottawa Homebuilders Association, reflected Schabas's skepticism when he told the Citizen that his members are not making any contingency plans to deal with swine flu. They think the danger is manufactured.</p>
<p>"People think the health authorities and the media are crying wolf, and they don't see it as a legitimate threat," he says.</p>
<p>But flu experts like McGill's Ward reject the scaremongering accusations against public health officials as nonsense. As with avian flu and SARS, public health officials just don't know if they are dealing with a mass killer or a bogus threat, he says. And just because SARS didn't kill millions doesn't mean H1N1 or a future virus won't. The science is not advanced enough to predict with certainty what might happen every time a new virus erupts. Ward says public health officials simply can't afford to be complacent in the face of a virus that has the potential to kill millions. If they were to assume that H1N1 is benign, and it turns out to be worse, the very people who are now criticizing them would be the first in line to ask for their heads. He says the critics "are right until they are wrong" and then, everybody pays.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Libman, director of the division of infectious diseases at McGill University, says critics of the way the WHO and public health agencies have handled the H1N1 outbreak remind him of how New Orleans dealt with the threat of flooding.</p>
<p>"They sat there for years and years in New Orleans, and every year a hurricane goes a little to the left, and then a little to the right, but everybody knew that sooner or later one of them was going to hit," says Libman.</p>
<p>"They didn't know if it was going to be next year or 50 years, but even though they knew it would happen, they didn't prepare for it. And when it happened, they weren't ready. The fact that you've heard it all before is not a reason not to prepare properly."</p>
<p>Brown, the University of Ottawa virologist, acknowledges that H1N1 could easily fizzle out, proving the critics right. But it is showing such a nasty streak in laboratory tests on animals that one can't rule out completely that it could spring a surprise.</p>
<p>"This is not a black-and-white situation; the future is not that clear," Brown says.</p>
<p>"You have to take it seriously but it is not like the end of the world."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine flu could overwhelm ICUs: WHO; H1N1 'has rapidly established itself' to become dominant strain of influenza</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>681 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization is warning countries to prepare the intensive-care units of their hospitals for a surge of swine flu cases in the coming months.</p>
<p>In a pandemic update Friday, WHO advised countries in the Northern Hemisphere to get ready for a second wave and said doctors from around the world are reporting "a very severe form" of the disease, particularly in young and otherwise healthy people.</p>
<p>The update did not specify how many of these severe cases have been reported, but said in these patients the virus directly infected the lungs and caused extreme respiratory failure. Saving their lives depended on highly specialized and demanding care in ICUs, "usually with long and costly stays," WHO said.</p>
<p>The update confirmed the H1N1 virus "has rapidly established itself" and is the dominant strain of the influenza virus that is circulating in most parts of the world.</p>
<p>At least 2,185 people have died from the swine flu and there have been life-threatening cases, but the majority of cases around the world continue to be mild, according to the report, and the strain shows no signs of mutating into a more lethal form.</p>
<p>"While these trends are encouraging, large numbers of people in all countries remain susceptible to infection," the update said</p>
<p>Even if the cases remain mild, the effect of the second wave could still be significant because of the number of people who may fall ill, and a higher number of severe cases could strain health-care systems," according to the report.</p>
<p>"Larger numbers of severely ill patients requiring intensive care are likely to be the most urgent burden on health services, creating pressures that could overwhelm intensive care units and possibly disrupt the provision of care for other diseases," said WHO, which advised that preparedness measures should anticipate the increased demand on ICUs.</p>
<p>The effect of swine flu on ICUs and their ability to effectively treat patients with severe forms of the flu is on the agenda of a two-day conference being held next week in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Public health officials, ICU specialists and other experts from across Canada and the world are expected to review strategies to prepare for the anticipated second wave of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Canada's public health officials are hesitant to make predictions about how many people could contract the virus during a second wave, or when it will arrive.</p>
<p>On Friday, Chief Public Health Officer Dr. David Butler-Jones and Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq appeared before the House of Commons health committee for the second time this month.</p>
<p>They were questioned about preparedness for the pandemic's second wave, and in particular on plans to help First Nations communities cope with outbreaks.</p>
<p>The federal government, which is responsible for health-care for aboriginal Canadians, faces ongoing criticism over its response to outbreaks on several reserves in the spring in northern Manitoba and on what it is doing now to help communities prepare.</p>
<p>The committee heard from a long list of witnesses, including Shawn Atleo, the newly elected national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, Ron Evans, Manitoba's grand chief, and other representatives of the aboriginal community.</p>
<p>After Aglukkaq outlined measures the government has taken to help First Nations, New Democratic Party MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis said the minister presented a "rosy picture" and that it "flies in the face of everything we are hearing from First Nations communities."</p>
<p>"I don't think anybody here today would dare suggest that we are as prepared as we should be at this point at the end of August," said Wasylycia-Leis.</p>
<p>Chief Evans said the government "dragged their feet" when his community asked for help, and said he is concerned the swine flu will hit reserves again before the vaccine is ready to be administered in mid-November.</p>
<p>The pandemic is an opportunity to address the poor living conditions and serious health issues in many First Nations communities, Evans said.</p>

<p>Few First Nations communities have flu plan, leaders say</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq says 90 per cent of First Nations communities in Canada have a flu pandemic preparedness plan, but native leaders say that misrepresents the grim reality. Aglukkaq acknowledged that the first round of the H1N1 virus last spring hit Canada's remote native communities hard, but she said a plan is in place for the coming flu season. Few of the native chiefs and health care workers who followed Aglukkaq at the parliamentary committee hearing Friday seemed to agree. One northern Manitoba chief, Sydney Garrioch of the Keewatinowi Okimakanak, said only two of 30 communities in his territory have a flu plan in place.</p>

<p>Alberta delays decision to lift</p>
<p>ban on hunting grizzly bears</p>
<p>Alberta is delaying a decision on whether to lift a ban on hunting grizzly bears until next year and will base its decision on science and an independent review, a government official says. The move comes after the Alberta Fish and Game Association urged the province to immediately reinstate the hunt, saying grizzlies are becoming bolder and the best way to keep the bears wild is to allow them to be hunted again. At the same time, environmental groups are calling for the iconic animals to be declared as threatened and the ban on hunting maintained.</p>

<p>The RCMP won't be laying any charges against anyone who may have helped fugitive U.S. reality TV actor Ryan Jenkins in his run home to Canada. Police say there is no evidence to support criminal charges because a warrant for Jenkins' arrest wasn't issued until the day after a woman apparently checked him into a Hope, B.C. motel. U.S. authorities believe Jenkins fled California last week after allegedly murdering his wife, former swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore.</p>

<p>A British pilot was seriously injured today when a vintage biplane crashed at the Gatineau, Que., airport. The plane, which officials say was a Tiger Moth that had been used for training during the Second World War, crashed about 50 metres off the runway in a grassy open field. Howard Cook, of Duxford, England - an internationally known vintage plane pilot - was taken to Gatineau hospital with injuries, including broken legs, facial cuts and a back injury, which are not believed to be life-threatening. Cook and the plane were to have participated in a weekend vintage air show.</p>

<p>Two violent home invasions</p>
<p>in two days probed by police</p>
<p>Two violent home invasions are being investigated by police in Calgary. Thursday afternoon, two or three men forced their way into a home, pushing a woman well over 80-years-old to the floor before leaving her tied up for several hours. The men robbed the house of an undisclosed amount of cash and took other items as well. Then early Friday morning, three or four men forced their way into another Calgary house and tied up four people before ransacking the home, stealing cash and valuables. The description of one of the suspects is a close match in both cases and at least one of the robbers was armed with a handgun.</p>

<p>Ottawa to force railways</p>

<p>For nearly a decade, countless Canadian freight trains traversed the continent on potentially faulty wheels - several of them derailing as a result - while recall "shortfalls" by Canadian National Railway and inaction by Transport Canada hamstrung efforts to get them out of service. Now, Ottawa is cracking down on Canadian railways to force them to keep track of their parts in hopes of eliminating the systemic problems that allowed the wheels to remain in use for more than eight years. Legislation is being drafted to impose tough tracking requirements, similar to those already in place for aviation companies, Transport Canada spokesperson.</p>

</p>
<p>A day after Premier Gary Doer pulled the plug on his 23-year political career to become Canada's ambassador to the U.S., the contenders to replace him largely avoided the limelight as they pondered their futures.</p>
<p>Senior ministers said they needed at least the weekend to see if they have the family, political support and intestinal fortitude to take over as NDP party leader and assume the province's biggest political job.</p>
<p>Many said Friday they had no idea Doer would resign Thursday and until now hadn't contemplated a run for the leadership.</p>
<p>"I really don't want to speculate about the leadership," said Labour and Immigration Minister Nancy Allan, thought by some to be interested in Doer's old job. "I'm just still grieving."</p>
<p>An official for Family Services Minister Gord Mackintosh said he is also taking the weekend to decide what he should do.</p>
<p>The same was true for Intergovernmental Affairs Steve Ashton, one of the few ministers Friday to meet with reporters. "I certainly will be looking at it," the longtime Thompson MLA said, adding he will be talking to party members in his constituency and across the province before making a decision.</p>
<p>All three said they had no inkling Doer would step down when he did.</p>
<p>The party executive is meeting Monday evening to set a time and place for a leadership convention. Provincial party president Lorraine Sigurdson said Friday it would be difficult logistically to hold the convention before mid-October.</p>
<p>Ashton said most leadership contenders would want to know more about the timing and format of a convention before throwing their hat into the ring.</p>
<p>None of the names bandied for the leadership would confirm they were running on Friday.</p>
<p>"I'm still sitting on the fence," Winnipeg Centre NDP MP Pat Martin said. "No one can commit to anything until they know what the rules are."</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald was not available Friday, saying through an intermediary that her top priority now is preparing for a potential flu outbreak. The spokesman said that Oswald will discuss her future with her family.</p>
<p>The timing of the convention will be crucial for many candidates, who will have difficulty marshalling support and selling memberships if the timeline is tight.</p>
<p>Under party rules a delegate to a convention must have been a party member in good standing for at least 30 days. A constituency's delegate strength at convention will be determined based on the number of eligible members it has 30 days prior to the convention.</p>
<p>That constraint won't give candidates enough time to sell memberships as there's pressure on the party to decide Doer's successor quickly, as early as four to six weeks, Martin said.</p>
<p>The pressure to decide the leadership quickly is to show that the government can function smoothly without Doer at a time when the economy is just recovering and there is a threat of an H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure people will want to throw things open," Martin said.</p>
<p>Martin's federal colleague, Winnipeg North NDP MP Judy Wasylycia-Leis, said she doesn't want the job.</p>
<p>"I'm flattered, but I'm just not at all interested in pursuing the leadership," she said Friday.</p>
<p>She said that Bill Blaikie, a former colleague of hers in Ottawa, likely isn't a serious candidate. "I only see him being involved in government," Wasylycia-Leis said of Blaikie.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Tory Leader Hugh McFadyen said the pressure on the NDP to replace Doer quickly, and to show party harmony to Manitobans, could mean the leadership race will be more of a coronation than a contest.</p>

</p>
<p>Brooke VanAssen can't do many of the things other kids her age take for granted: scrub her teeth, roughhouse, gnaw at the inside of her cheek or absent-mindedly pick her nose, as all children do but never admit. These things put her at risk of hemorrhaging.</p>
<p>Under the apple of her left cheek is a tangled mass of abnormal blood vessels fed by Brooke's carotid artery.</p>
<p>Her gums and the inside of her cheek are purple, so to run the soft bristles of a toothbrush along them could cause them to bleed. If Brooke was hit by a baseball, fell off her bike or sneezed violently, the mass of veins and arteries swelling her face could burst.</p>
<p>Brooke, 9, has an arteriovenous malformation in her face. It is a rare congenital disorder that affects less than one per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Treatments haven't worked.</p>
<p>In the past two years, the gnarled mass has tripled in size and fills 70 per cent of her sinuses. The bone under her last two teeth has been worn away by the pulsating balloon of blood flow, much like a rock is worn away by rushing streams.</p>
<p>Her parents will soon face bills of more than $120,000 US for hospital and medical fees so that Brooke can get specialized treatment from an American doctor who says he can cure the young girl.</p>
<p>They flew to Denver, Colo., for the first of several treatments after the Alberta government denied funding for the out-of-country trips, saying comparable treatment was available in Canada. Jodi and Rob VanAssen disagree and will be taking Brooke to the U.S. for at least three more appointments at $35,000 to $40,000 each time.</p>
<p>"Brooke's worth that kind of money," said Rob VanAssen, Brooke's father. "We had to do it and we can't afford it ourselves, but we trust and know the Lord is in charge of all things."</p>
<p>"The power of prayer has been awesome," said Jodi VanAssen, Brooke's mother.</p>
<p>While both are angry with the government's decision to turn down their funding request -- they have appealed the decision and expect to hear back early this month -- they are turning toward their small farming and church community for financial and emotional help.</p>
<p>The VanAssens, who have six children, haven't made a profit on their pig farm for the past three years. Hog prices recently fell from, hit hard by the fear surrounding the H1N1 swine flu virus.</p>
<p>Now, on top of a struggling farm, they have a daughter who wanders upstairs during the night, crying because she's had nightmares about losing her face and worried about the money it will take to fix it.</p>
<p>"How do you comprehend that as a nine-year-old?" Rob asked.</p>
<p>The couple may consider taking out a loan to help pay the medical bills, but members of the Canadian Reformed Church in their small farming community of Neerlandia, about 135 kilometres northwest of Edmonton, set up a trust fund for donations. Brooke's school held a barbecue and an Edmonton church held a garage sale. A bucket for donations was set up at the farmers' market in nearby Barrhead. Strangers from the Westlock have even driven to Brooke's home to drop off money.</p>
<p>Enough has been raised to cover Brooke's first two medical visits.</p>
<p>"It gives us confidence that people believe in the decision we've made," Jodi said. "But ultimately, we know it can't last."</p>
<p>The problems started two years ago when Brooke began waking up each morning with a pool of blood on her pillow. Doctors made various diagnoses: an infection, a rare but severe bacteria treated with strong antibiotics, a birthmark in her cheek.</p>
<p>Then, on Valentine's Day 2007, Brooke almost bled to death when an Edmonton dentist extracted a molar, thinking there was something beneath the tooth.</p>
<p>She fainted in her father's arms and was taken by ambulance to the Stollery Children's Hospital where she received a blood transfusion.</p>
<p>Eventually, doctors diagnosed Brooke with an AVM, or arteriovenous malformation, in her cheek. Some AVMs go unnoticed or can be safely cut out, although there is no guarantee they won't grow back. They can occur all over the body, in the lungs or heart, on feet or fingers, even the brain, where bleeding can lead to a stroke.</p>
<p>The congenital lesions are present at birth, created in the womb when more "primitive" blood vessels are supposed to be reabsorbed by the fetus and replaced by more mature blood vessels. This reabsorption doesn't happen in some babies, leaving these abnormal vessels to grow into knots.</p>
<p>In Brooke's case, cutting out the AVM isn't an option.</p>
<p>"If you have to live without a jaw bone, it's not so easy," said Dr. Lyle McGonigle, Brooke's pediatrician. "It's a difficult thing to treat and it's a bad AVM. It's in a bad place and it's difficult to get at. It has lots of feeding vessels. I think it's pretty dangerous,"especially as Brooke begins losing her baby teeth.</p>
<p>Doctors in Edmonton began treating her with embolization, using glue to create clots in the blood vessels. The work is complex and comes with some risk. If the wrong vessels are plugged, blood could stop feeding Brooke's nose, eye or cheekbone, potentially killing the tissue and parts of Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"It's probably been somewhat effective, but not very effective," McGonigle said of Brooke's early treatments. "In Brooke's case, it's hard to know what the right therapy is. I can tell you she needs therapy and she needs aggressive therapy."</p>
<p>McGonigle wrote an official letter to the province's Out of Country Health Services Committee, requesting funding coverage for the VanAssens to send Brooke to the United States for a different type of embolization therapy by Dr. Wayne Yakes. McGonigle said he isn't convinced the American-based therapy is more beneficial to Brooke, but believes the government should financially support the parents' decision.</p>
<p>"Dr. Yakes is very aggressive in attempting to clot off AVMs and he does it with a technique that is not universally accepted and has high risks and high side effects," McGonigle said. "(Brooke) needs treatment and she needs aggressive treatment and the parents have decided that's the treatment they want after studying the available information to them. I think that is therapy we probably should be paying for her."</p>
<p>Yakes, who invented a different embolization process in 1983 and established Colorado's Vascular Malformation Center in 1991, said his treatment is the only curative, rather than palliative, one.</p>
<p>He said plugging the vessels with glue actually spurs new growth because endothelial cells lining the blood vessels sense decreased oxygen and seek to fix the problem by causing white blood cells to rush to the blocked sites to carry out the glue particles. The endothelial cells also spark the growth of new blood vessels to the area and stimulate the AVM.</p>
<p>Yakes said the glue treatment must be done over and over again without any definitive cure.</p>
<p>His treatment uses alcohol to destroy the endothelial cells lining the blood vessels in the AVM. When the endothelial cells die and peal off the vessel walls, platelets rush to patch the sites. They clump together and clot the blood flow permanently, Yakes said. He, too, must be careful not to block crucial blood flow to parts of Brooke's face.</p>
<p>"It's not experimental at all," said Yakes. "It's been proven in literature on every continent."</p>
<p>Yakes said 80 per cent of the cases he treats with alcohol are cured. He sees about 1,000 patients each year from around the world, and helped train doctors in Cairo, London, Korea, Japan, New Zealand and Europe. He's currently working with experts from the Czech Republic.</p>
<p>He said Brooke's treatment is going well so far.</p>
<p>"She is such a tough little kid," he said in a telephone interview. He is also helping the VanAssens by providing multiple treatments at each visit, but only charging for one. "We're unfortunate that the (Alberta) government refused to do anything to help and they count their health-care services the best in the world. Denying this child, I think that's unconscionable."</p>
<p>John Tuckwell, spokesman for Alberta Health, said he can't comment on Brooke's case, but said the committee that looks at applications for out-of-country health care makes its decisions based solely on medical advice. The committee isn't even told how much the treatments cost.</p>
<p>Tuckwell said the committee tries to determine if the treatment is available elsewhere in Canada rather than another country.</p>
<p>In its letter to the VanAssens, the committee said it denied funding because embolization treatment with glue is available in Alberta and Toronto, even though "it may not be the technique and/or particular treatment the parent prefers."</p>
<p>"Canadian resources have not been fully utilized," the letter reads.</p>
<p>Rob and Jodi VanAssen said their decision has nothing to do with preference, but is necessary for their daughter.</p>
<p>"We are upset. We are very disappointed," Rob said. "The minister of health is putting a stranglehold on our health-care system."</p>
<p>"It's not about preference. It's about a cure," Jodi said. "To them, our daughter is a number with a big dollar sign beside her name. But she's our daughter. How can you say a life isn't important?"</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic movies have their own odd appeal</b>
</div><div>Peter McKnight   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>1302 words</div><div>29 August 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Not long after the Second World War, North Americans were revelling in a Japanese invasion. Japanese monster movies were all the rage, with Godzilla and friends raging down the streets of Tokyo and across movie screens throughout the continent.</p>
<p>What a difference a few years make. Despite recent American remakes of Godzilla, and despite director J.J. Abrams' attempts to create a homegrown, made-in-America monster with Cloverfield, the giant monsters have recently been buried by tiny ones.</p>
<p>Specifically, by microbes. The last few decades have witnessed a veritable pandemic of pandemic flicks, in which little monsters do what Godzilla never could: destroy not just Tokyo, but the world.</p>
<p>We've seen, for example, a lonely Vincent Price in the The Last Man on Earth (1964), which was remade as The Omega Man starring Charlton Heston in 1971, which then became a vehicle for Will Smith in 2007 as I am Legend. There was also a fourth version, I am Omega, starring straight-to-video martial artist Mark Dacascos, but forget I mentioned it.</p>
<p>Although each of these movies differs in details, the plots are similar enough -- humanity has been wiped out, except for a lone human and a not-so-merry band of photophobic deformities, as a result of those damnable scientists creating biological weapons or a cure for cancer that goes awry.</p>
<p>Then there was George Romero's 1968 classic Night of the Living Dead -- the granddaddy of zombie flicks -- in which our metabolically challenged anti-heroes first rise from a cemetery. We later learn, while they're chewing their way through a shopping mall in the sequel Dawn of the Dead, they were the product of a plague.</p>
<p>Next came Michael Chrichton's The Andromeda Strain, first filmed in 1971 in a faithful adaptation of the book, and "re-imagined" in a 2008 TV miniseries.</p>
<p>Here a satellite containing an alien microbe falls to Earth, and earthlings soon start falling themselves, and falling over themselves in search of an antidote.</p>
<p>In 1995, we saw Outbreak, probably the least fantastic of the pandemic movies in that not a single zombie or alien made the cut. Then again, having Dustin Hoffman scurrying around trying to save the world is probably fantastic enough.</p>
<p>The Brits got in on the action with 28 Days Later (2002) and its sequel 28 Weeks Later (2007) -- is there a prize for guessing what the third instalment will be called? Oh, wait, I just read that 28 Months Later will be released in 2011. Anyway, here we had a virus, released when animal rights activists vandalized a lab, turning people into, you guessed it, flesh-eating zombies.</p>
<p>Not to be outdone, the Spanish produced REC (2007) -- remade in English as the vastly inferior Quarantine (2008) -- in which a rabies-like virus, stolen by a doomsday cult from a military research lab, magically transforms people in an apartment building into -- do I have to tell you?</p>
<p>That's just a small sample of the worldwide end-of-the-world-in-a-microbe mythos. But how did the little monsters come to eclipse the big ones? And how did we come to be awash in viruses and bacteria? Blame Richard Matheson. The celebrated sci-fi author, who penned many of the original Twilight Zone episodes and a series of acclaimed novels and short stories, is also almost single-handedly responsible for the disease-apocalypse scenario, and for the rise of the zombie.</p>
<p>The year was 1954, the very year that Godzilla first strutted his stuff for Japanese audiences. In that year, Matheson also strutted his stuff, publishing the novel that would become his most famous: I am Legend.</p>
<p>Not that I am Legend. Not the one with Will Smith, or Charlton Heston, or Vincent Price. Matheson rejected all three treatments since they were insufficiently faithful to his vision.</p>
<p>Matheson's vision had Robert Neville, an apparently lone human at war with people who were infected by a bacterium and now resemble vampires.</p>
<p>Neville meets a woman, Ruth, who also appears uninfected, but is sympathetic to the vampires.</p>
<p>Eventually he discovers that Ruth is infected, that the vampires have begun to rebuild society and that they hate Neville for killing some of their members.</p>
<p>Neville is ultimately captured by the vampires, and comes to realize that he has become the biological deviant, that he is the sole survivor of an obsolete race, that he -- not the vampire -- is now legend. Upon realizing this, and with Ruth's help, he commits suicide.</p>
<p>One can readily see here the genesis of the pandemic-apocalypse theme as well as the zombie motif. George Romero in fact admitted that Night of the Living Dead was "ripped off" from I am Legend, and Stephen King, whose novel The Stand concerns a human-made superflu, has admitted a debt to Matheson.</p>
<p>King's recent novel Cell, which involves zombies, is dedicated to Matheson and Romero.</p>
<p>This explains the inspiration for pandemic films, but not their appeal. There's an easy answer for this, though: Unlike Godzilla, who, let's face it, is pretty hard to miss, microbes are, by definition, invisible. We never know when we're coming into contact with a virus or a bacterium and hence they produce the greatest fear of all: fear of the unknown.</p>
<p>And that fear is exacerbated by the breakdown in communications that inevitably follows an outbreak.</p>
<p>The appeal of movies also depends on the cultural milieu in which they arise. Many Japanese movie monsters were in some way associated with atomic weapons -- Godzilla, for instance, was the product of atomic radiation -- which is entirely understandable given that they were spawned in the only country that has experienced the horrors of nuclear war.</p>
<p>Similarly, and despite the fact that pandemic movies are virtually never scientifically accurate, these films rose to popularity in the age of AIDS, a time when some feared the disease would render I am Legend more science than fiction.</p>
<p>Reports of other exotic viruses, such as Ebola -- Outbreak concerned an Ebola-like virus -- and Hantavirus solidified this fear, and with new viruses such as H1N1 making appearances, dangerous microbes continue to occupy our imagination more than our bodies.</p>
<p>The invisibility of microbes also allows them to act as metaphors. For example, since I am Legend was published during the height of the "red scare," when people feared that undercover communists were threatening America, many commentators interpreted the novel as a narrative about communism.</p>
<p>Matheson has explicitly denied that this was his intention, but one can see Ruth, the apparent human who is actually working for and from the other side, as a metaphor for the undercover commies that Senator Joseph McCarthy sought to expose.</p>
<p>Microbes work equally well as a metaphor in the age of terrorism, since just as we never know who might be infected, people were oblivious to the fact that those quiet young men down the hall were preparing a terrorist attack on 9/11. Much like in pandemic movies, you can never tell for sure whether or when your neighbour might morph into a flesh-eater.</p>
<p>Given this state of affairs, the prognosis for pandemic flicks is good: They are likely to have a long and healthy life, even though they're more fiction than fact, more tale than truth.</p>
<p>They are, one might say, their own curious form of legend.</p>

<p>Federal health officials say they are trying to speed up the delivery of Canada's swine flu vaccine, but won't rush into making it available before it's been thoroughly tested and approved.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, said Thursday in a call with reporters the vaccine is expected to be ready in mid-November and the government is aiming "to see if we can shorten that timeline."</p>
<p>He said the government is working with GlaxoSmith</p>
<p>Kline, the manufacturer, and Health Canada, the regulatory body, to get the vaccine "as early as possible," but he emphasized the importance of ensuring the vaccine's safety.</p>
<p>"Rushing into a vaccine before we've done appropriate testing and regulatory approval would not be wise in this context," he said. Canada is experiencing mostly mild cases of the swine flu, the health care system is able to manage the serious cases and early treatment of the illness is proving effective, he said, explaining the context.</p>
<p>Questions about rushing the vaccine were raised this week in the United States by a report from President Barack Obama's advisory council on science and technology. It recommended federal officials help drug companies speed up their supply of swine flu drugs and vaccines so that some shots could be administered in mid-September instead of mid-October.</p>
<p>Concerns have been raised in Canada also about whether the vaccine's scheduled delivery in November will be too late for a second wave of the pandemic, which could be sparked by children returning to classrooms where influenza viruses are easily spread.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said the best-case scenario would be for Canada to experience a typical flu period, meaning a peak of cases in January and February, because Canadians who want or need the swine flu vaccine would certainly have it by then.</p>
<p>When the second wave of the pandemic will come remains a question mark, however, and Butler-Jones said as soon as the vaccine is ready it will be shipped out to the provinces and territories, who are responsible for delivering health care.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, what is paramount is that we do have, in fact, a safe, effective vaccine and we are able to get it into people's arms before we get to the bulk of the pandemic later in the season," he said.</p>
<p>Each province and territory has their own plan for how the immunization programs will operate, which include, for example, who will be authorized to give the shots. Some provinces, such as Alberta, are looking at having pharmacists and paramedics trained to do the injections.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said vaccines have a long history of being safe and that Canadians should get the swine flu shot, but that it is an individual choice.</p>

</p>
<p>With the aim of speeding up the passenger-screening process and enhancing airport security, the Regina International Airport is doing a test run on new pre-boarding screening procedures.</p>
<p>The 14-week trial by the Canadian Air Transport Security Authority (CATSA) began Wednesday and ends Dec. 1.</p>
<p>"We hope this is going to allow it (CATSA) to increase and improve on the security-screening experience for the travelling public, not only here at the Regina airport but -- if they are successful -- then throughout Canada,'' Jim Hunter, president and CEO of the Regina Airport Authority, told reporters on Thursday.</p>
<p>CATSA regional manager Alex Hauszner said the pilot project will help CATSA educate passengers about avoiding unnecessary metal detector alarms, and identifies ways to make the best use of available resources and space while maintaining high security standards.</p>
<p>It will not involve the hiring of any additional staff or the purchase of any additional equipment, he said.</p>
<p>"It is not about revolution, but about evolution. We certainly want to tweak different aspects of the screening process at various stages of the trials to see what positives and what gains we get out of that expeditious handling of the passenger because the passenger experience is critical for us, just as the security aspect is critical,'' Hauszner said.</p>
<p>The pilot project involves four distinct phases, each of which will introduce gradual modifications to two of the airport's four passenger screening lanes.</p>
<p>The changes include new procedures for passengers who set off the metal detector alarm, new pat-down techniques, larger X-ray bins, and different locations and roles for screening personnel.</p>
<p>"The intent is that we expedite the screening. So at the first phase, it is about educating the passenger in terms of divesting properly,'' Hauszner said.</p>
<p>Hauszner added he had the opportunity to observe the implementation of the first phase of the new screening procedures on Wednesday and on Thursday morning and gather feedback from passengers and screening officers.</p>
<p>"They have already noticed a difference in terms of efficiency and expediting the flow (of passengers) on that line. And this is phase one and we are looking at some other tweaking as we move along in the different phasing (of the trial). This is tentatively very positive already,'' Hauszner said.</p>
<p>While screening for passengers who could potentially be carriers of the H1N1 virus is not part of this pilot project, Hauszner said CATSA is aware of the issue and there is planning under way.</p>
<p>"It is definitely on the front burner,'' he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Once the Liberals' top cause, EI is now just one file among many; Party says it won't topple Tories over unemployment</b>
</div><div>BILL CURRY </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- Employment insurance was the big issue in June as Michael Ignatieff and Stephen Harper locked horns in a classic minority Parliament power play, but Liberals now say it's just one file among many and EI will not trigger a fall vote.</p>
<p>After a flurry of news conferences and private meetings, the Liberal Leader and the Prime Minister agreed in June to a bipartisan panel on reforming Canada's safety net for the unemployed, and a summer election was avoided.</p>
<p>But Mr. Ignatieff's campaign co-chairman and a Liberal member of that panel are now saying that even if it fails to produce a deal, Liberals will not force an election on EI alone.</p>
<p>Liberal Senator David Smith, co-chairman of the national Liberal campaign, said EI is not a “defining issue” that merits bringing down the government.</p>
<p>That still leaves open the possibility of a no-confidence vote on other issues, such as the state of the economy, but the senior Liberal is clearly throwing cold water on election speculation as MPs prepare for next week's caucus retreat in Sudbury.</p>
<p>“I don't see an election being fought over unemployment insurance,” said Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>“It's an important issue and it's an issue that we want to address … but I don't see that as the defining issue that would trigger an election.”</p>
<p>The senator, who takes part in regular conference calls with senior Liberals across the country, went on to question the need for an election at this time. His comments are in sharp contrast to more hawkish statements coming from Liberals over the summer. As recently as Monday, the Liberal Party was sending out private talking points stating that “Stephen Harper's got to go.”</p>
<p>Mr. Smith isn't using those talking points.</p>
<p>“Michael and the Liberal Party remain committed to wanting to see Parliament work, to want to hold them accountable. Does that mean, on every single issue, when you've got the NDP and Bloc [Québécois] voting on matters that could be deemed confidence to bring them down, that we have to push the button every time?” he asked, noting that polls consistently show Canadians do not want an election. “We just don't have to be in a constant shootout at the O.K. Corral for an election every time Parliament meets and there's a vote of substance in the House.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister's Office jumped on Mr. Smith's comments yesterday, expressing hope that the upcoming Parliamentary session will move past election speculation. “We're pleased that cooler heads have prevailed and there will not be an election this fall,” said spokesman Dimitri Soudas.</p>
<p>The senator's comments are the latest twist in the continuing political theatre over EI.</p>
<p>Mr. Ignatieff's approach to rattling sabres with the Prime Minister triggered much debate and second-guessing among Liberals as to the wisdom of the strategy. Subsequent polls showing a dip in Liberal support gave credence to Mr. Ignatieff's internal doubters.</p>
<p>A well-informed party source said disappointing internal polls have cooled the Liberals' enthusiasm for an election. Canadians, the source said, just don't grasp Mr. Ignatieff's vision for the country and have not warmed to him since he became leader.</p>
<p>The Prime Minister also recently played down election talk and divisions over EI. He told reporters last week the positions of both sides are “a bit different,” but EI reforms would be announced in the fall.</p>
<p>Marlene Jennings, who is one of three Liberal MPs on the six-person panel, agreed that an election will not be triggered solely on the issue of EI, and insisted that was never in the party's plans. She said the Conservatives are attempting to portray the Liberals as a single-issue party, when in fact the Official Opposition has a long list of concerns, including the economy, agriculture, the salmon shortage in British Columbia, consular cases, the H1N1 virus and medical isotopes.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario high school teachers who are pregnant or immune-compromised should not have to work in a school where they would be exposed to the human swine flu, their association says.</p>
<p>Ken Coran, president of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers' Federation, said they're developing plans in case an H1N1 pandemic materializes in schools this fall and winter. Teachers who are considered particularly vulnerable would be taken out of class if there was an "elevated" chance of contracting the illness, although there are no plans to outright close schools.</p>
<p>"There's a lot of situations where someone's immune system could be depleted to some degree which means they would be more sensitive to getting various diseases," Coran said. "And when someone is pregnant that is obviously one of those situations where their immune system would be not as strong as in other times... we would say stay at home."</p>
<p>Teachers who come down with the flu would stay out until they're no longer contagious, he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Students' first lesson is battling flu; School boards bracing for second wave</b>
</div><div>Eva Ferguson   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>

<p>Today:</p>
<p>Staff, students review flu prevention lessons</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>It wasn't just the usual repertoire of reading, writing and arithmetic.</p>
<p>Students back at school for their first day Thursday received some serious lessons in flu prevention as health experts brace for a second wave of the H1N1 virus this fall-- fearing it could be worse than the first wave last spring.</p>
<p>Principals and teachers held meetings this week in preparation for the kids' first day back, reminding staff who work with students to again teach them about proper hygiene, rigorous hand-washing, coughing and sneezing etiquette and optimum nutrition to prevent the spread of disease.</p>
<p>And, as a companion to newsletters and information packages being sent home over the next several days, the Calgary Board of Education has just introduced a new page on its website geared solely to H1N1 flu awareness.</p>
<p>The link includes a series of kid-friendly posters, pod-casts and funny videos about how to prevent the spread of viruses.</p>
<p>The series of videos speaks especially well to school-aged kids at all levels, a generation who has grown up on computers and loves to download different types of media.</p>
<p>"We would hope all the teachers are talking about H1N1 again this week," said Ted Flitton, spokesman for the board, and part of a new H1N1 team created within the CBE.</p>
<p>"But as staff passes information on to kids, it's important to remember that a stand-and-deliver message can always use some retooling."</p>
<p>"So we're asking parents and teachers to refer to the website and work this into their lesson plans and curriculum."</p>
<p>Janet Sutherland, spokeswoman for the Calgary Catholic Board, added that kids in their schools are also being reminded and parents directed to an informational letter on the board's website.</p>
<p>The flu has caused 1,462 deaths worldwide since it was first detected in April. As many as 66 Canadian deaths have been linked to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Flitton said 19 kids within their schools contracted the flu last spring.</p>
<p>But at an annual meeting of Canadian doctors earlier this month, federal health minister Leona Aglukkaq told Canadian doctors the expected fall surge in H1N1 cases could challenge Canada's medical community like nothing before.</p>
<p>"What may come this fall is something that could test all of us, possibly to a limit we've never experienced."</p>
<p>Alberta Health Services has confirmed their basic flu vaccinations will be available at public health centres sometime in mid-October.</p>
<p>But spokesman James Finstad explained that since the World Health Organization has not yet developed a vaccine for H1N1, Alberta Health Services will have to wait until November to see whether they can roll one out for the public.</p>
<p>"That is all still in the planning stages at this point."</p>
<p>But parents worry their kids could already be sick by mid-November, and they'd like to see a vaccine provided sooner to kids right in the schools.</p>
<p>"Every year we go to the health centre for the flu shot, but it's so busy, it's really difficult," said Helen Scott, a volunteer mom at Grant MacEwan School.</p>
<p>"It would be nice if they could just give all the students the shots they need, right in the school."</p>
<p>Scott adds many kids in her son's junior high are already battling sore throats and coughs.</p>
<p>She is especially worried about him getting H1N1 since he's asthmatic with several allergies.</p>
<p>A major new university study issued last week concluded the best way to contain a flu pandemic is to vaccinate all schoolchildren and their parents.</p>
<p>The report, released Aug. 20 by Yale and Clemson universities, says it's best to vaccinate those most likely to transmit viruses, rather than those at highest risk for complications.</p>
<p>Sue Pullman, a lunchroom supervisor at Grant MacEwan, says all of her staff are being especially vigilant about ensuring kids are washing their hands everyday before they eat lunch.</p>
<p>Many parents, she added, are starting to put hand sanitizer and disinfectant wipes in their kids'lunch boxes too.</p>
<p>Jackie Bayliss, a Grade 6 student at the school, says hand sanitizers in classrooms and hallways are helpful in reminding kids to keep hands clean. The CBE is working to get hand sanitizers installed in all of its classrooms this year.</p>
<p>"I know it's really important to always wash your hands so you don't get sick."</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>Healthy Advice</p>
<p>Cover Up When Coughing Or Sneezing</p>
<p>Cough or sneeze into a tissue and then throw it away. Cover your cough or sneeze if you do not have a tissue. then clean your hands, and do so every time you cough or sneeze.</p>
<p>Singing Happy Birthday</p>
<p>Wash your hands with soap and warm water for 15 to 20 seconds; about the time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.</p>
<p>Gel Sanitizers</p>
<p>If using gel, rub your hands until dry. the alcohol in it kills the germs on your hands.</p>

<div>Q: Queries - Quibbles - Quirks</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Rx for improved health care</b>
</div><div>Stephen Duckett   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>1043 words</div><div>28 August 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>In the past couple of weeks a great deal of attention-- and there will be more--has been focused on the changes underway in Alberta's health system. We welcome it.</p>
<p>The transformation and the challenges we face are unprecedented. And because we all have a stake in the outcome, it will be critical to our success that we engage the people we serve and the 90,000 dedicated, informed health-care experts on our front lines.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that we are not creating a health system for this year or next, but for generations to come. We are stepping forward at the earliest stages and being transparent about what we think needs to be done, and why. Our plans and proposals are not carved in stone because we know that we do not have all of the answers.</p>
<p>The most significant changes within Alberta Health Services will centre on the balance of hospital and community-based care --providing the right care in the right place.</p>
<p>Every day, hundreds of patients across the province are in hospitals because we do not have the broad scope of community-based care that would provide better treatment and support closer to their homes. There has been plenty of speculation about what that means for our patients, so let me be absolutely clear: no hospital spaces will be closed unless and until community-based beds and services are in place. Full stop.</p>
<p>We recently announced a decision not to redevelop one of our psychiatric hospitals, Alberta Hospital Edmonton, and instead focus on creating more community-based mental health spaces. I was not surprised by some of the opposition to the decision. We all feel strongly about the interests of all of our patients. But that does not change the fact that the decision was based on the best medical evidence and advice. We can and will balance our budget. We can and will be international leaders in the transformation of health. But most importantly, we can and will put the needs and interests of our patients first.</p>
<p>Health care in Alberta is good, often excellent and in some areas world-leading. You are more likely to survive a heart attack in Alberta than anywhere else in the country. People survive strokes in Alberta at a rate well above the national rate. Our researchers and clinicians develop approaches and protocols that are picked up internationally as the best practices available anywhere. More than in any other province in the country, Albertans rate their own perceived health as excellent or very good.</p>
<p>Under the previous system, though, not everyone in Alberta had equitable access to the best possible health care. Artificial boundaries and inter-regional rivalries created unacceptable barriers. Financially, it is fair to say that the system was on the verge of collapse. We have a long way to go to stabilize it. The old model left us with a huge accumulated deficit, and the first thing to do when you are in a hole is to stop digging.</p>
<p>Our current spend was not sustainable. So, the next phase of a multi-year framework to develop a balanced budget will begin next week. Alberta Health Services entered the 2009/2010 budget year with a projected deficit of $1.3 billion. During the first phase of cost reduction, $650 million in potential annualized cost savings were identified and are being reviewed. Some are underway.</p>
<p>In the second phase, AHS will consult with staff to identify a further three per cent in annual cost savings. This week we also announced an early retirement/ buyout option for employees.</p>
<p>We will keep a close eye on the uptake and if it becomes apparent that we need to slow it down to ensure we have enough staff that is exactly what we will do. There are many people who might want to retire and in some cases we'll have to say, 'No, we need you to stay.'</p>
<p>But first, we will tackle this budget deficit by focusing on duplication and non-clinical opportunities to reduce spending. We've already identified several strategies in that area, including procurement, which is expected to save us at least $200 million. By purchasing as a single system, we can save $2 million on the products we need for arthroplasties--the replacement of hips, knees and shoulders giving out among the aging population. By moving to a single vendor for cardiac supplies, along with a backup vendor, we can save about $3.5 million dollars. We are beginning to realize millions in savings from consolidating back office functions in areas such as payroll, human resources, health records, and information management.</p>
<p>Back to patient care. A cornerstone of the plan to reduce the seasonal impact on our emergency departments this winter is our pandemic and seasonal influenza vaccination campaigns. Every Albertan is eligible for free H1N1 and seasonal influenza vaccine this year. We'll be running immunization clinics in mass venues as well as at Community Health Centres across the province. The more people we can protect against influenza viruses, the fewer we'll have needing care for influenza complications in hospital.</p>
<p>In the next few weeks we will talk more about performance targets--where we are setting the bar--and my personal commitment to access, quality and sustainability. Not one: All three.</p>
<p>There are tough decisions to come. Those decisions will be better informed through the constructive engagement of our staff, physicians, and you, the people we serve. I would rather be criticized for not having all of the answers today than for not spending enough time listening to the people who will helps us achieve all three goals: access, quality and sustainability.</p>
<p>In the few months since I moved here from Australia lots of people have already weighed in--I've seen and heard lots of good ideas, so that tells me this is the right way to go about balancing our budget while maintaining a commitment to put patients first.</p>
<p>It's time to get the discussion moving. I invite you to be part of it.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Superboard wait-times plan invites skepticism</b>
</div><div>Sarah Chernik   </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>386 words</div><div>28 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A19</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Re: "Superboard plans to cut wait times; Skepticism greets CEO's speech due to health budget constraints," The Journal, Aug. 26.</p>
<p>Let's see if I have this straight. Currently the health-care system is only allowing internal hires and has a hiring freeze on new staff, including new nursing graduates. As a result, many recent nursing graduates are leaving the province.</p>
<p>In other words, the supply of new nursing labour has been impeded --a problem that is likely to be felt for several years to come.</p>
<p>Turning to the labour supply currently in our health-care system, it is clear that there has been a shortage of allied health professionals and nurses for years. Waiting lists reflect that there is simply too much work in the system for the current number of staff and facilities to handle.</p>
<p>Yet this article implies that staff will be expected to take on additional duties. Even more confusing is that the duties mentioned--discharge planning and determining if patients are in need of actual emergency care --are something staff already do (triage is the usual term used for the latter).</p>
<p>One of the largest and most recognized problems contributing to longer waiting times is conspicuously absent from the article--the lack of proper long-term-care beds in the province. This lack has created a bottleneck as these patients are finished with the acute(hospital) portion of their treatment, but their medical conditions are too great for them to return home, even with home care. As long as these types of patients are occupying hospital beds, new patients can't be moved in to these beds, which begs the question, if capacity isn't going to be added to hospitals to increase the number of beds available and more long-term-care centres aren't going to be built, how will this bottleneck be resolved?</p>
<p>Finally there is H1N1 and the predictions of global pandemic this fall. Let's be clear--all duties related to H1N1, especially any preventive measures such as vaccinations, would be in addition to the workload that staff already has. So how can vaccinating for a potential future problem reduce the existing wait lists, which have nothing to do with H1N1?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Hospitals seek life-saving ventilators; Extraordinary measures may be needed to help patients breathe, doctor says</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>973 words</div><div>28 August 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Eastern Ontario hospitals are asking the province to double the number of specialized ventilators available to treat patients with life-threatening breathing problems in preparation for further outbreaks of the H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>The region has up to eight oscillation ventilators -- four at The Ottawa Hospital and the rest divided between the University of Ottawa Heart Institute and the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. The life-saving machines, which cost about $60,000 each, allow high pressures to be built up in the airways to completely open up the lung.</p>
<p>"We may have to double the number that we currently have," said Dr. Redouane Bouali, who leads a regional network of critical-care physicians.</p>
<p>The need for the extra ventilators has become apparent as more is learned about the H1N1 virus. Patients who become critically ill frequently develop severe lung injury, requiring extraordinary methods of mechanical ventilation to help them breathe for longer periods of time.</p>
<p>Oscillation ventilators are so specialized that even the most advanced teaching hospitals, which tend to have the highest levels of medical technology, often have only a handful of the machines.</p>
<p>Bouali, who's also a critical-care physician at The Ottawa Hospital, said provincial health officials have agreed to buy more oscillation ventilators and are ordering them. He expects the machines to arrive before the start of the fall flu season in October.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as part of pandemic planning, the region's most advanced intensive-care units are gearing up to make a specialized procedure called ECMO more widely available to treat critically ill flu patients, said Bouali.</p>
<p>The procedure, known as extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation, is a form of heart-and-lung bypass that helps patients breathe by infusing more oxygen into the bloodstream.</p>
<p>Both ECMO and oscillatory ventilation could be in greater demand this fall if, as predicted, a resurgence of flu leads to more critically ill patients.</p>
<p>In Eastern Ontario, pandemic planning among critical-care physicians has been guided by the experience of Australia, which has been battling the H1N1 virus since July, when the winter months in the southern hemisphere typically usher in the flu season. In consulting with his Australian colleagues, Bouali learned about the importance of having enough oscillation ventilators and ECMO capacity.</p>
<p>"According to the experience that the Australians have, we would probably need to have access to these technologies right away because we heard from them that the patients get sick very quickly," said Bouali.</p>
<p>In particular, those who were treated in advanced-level ICUs within 24 hours of developing severe breathing difficulties had a greater chance of being stabilized, said Bouali. That was especially the case for high-risk groups such as pregnant women and patients with obesity, heart and lung troubles, or weakened immune systems.</p>
<p>But the Australian example also showed that a surprising number of young patients with no pre-existing illnesses also needed extraordinary ventilation measures, said Bouali.</p>
<p>In total, Eastern Ontario hospitals have identified more than 350 ventilators, including oscillation devices already in stock, across the region. Emergency planners are working on ways to triage and transfer patients who need extraordinary ventilation.</p>
<p>Also in place is a plan to cope with a potential surge in critically ill flu patients. Over the past year, 18 hospitals, including The Ottawa Hospital and CHEO, have tested common steps they should follow when faced with overcrowding in intensive-care units.</p>
<p>The plan, devised after the 2003 SARS outbreak in Toronto, is designed to give patients quicker access to the region's 110 ICU beds during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Eastern Ontario is probably better prepared than some other parts of the province because it was one of the regions selected to test the plan.</p>
<p>What's more, since the first cases of H1N1 were reported in late April, critical-care physicians and nurses have been meeting regularly to share information and help each other prepare for the worst, said Bouali. "I think the experience of SARS has pushed people to learn from that. Honestly, I have the feeling that we're better prepared today compared to what happened in 2003."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in preparation for the resurgence of the H1N1 virus, the city's public-health officials are spending the next month finalizing plans for a network of clinics to assess and treat flu patients who don't have family doctors, or who can't get appointments quickly to see them.</p>
<p>"We're planning for two streams of access to care during a pandemic," said Dr. Nadine Sicard, Ottawa's associate medical officer of health.</p>
<p>"One is for people who have a family-care provider, and we're working with family physicians to try to see what are their needs and how we can support that. And then there will be another stream for people that don't have a family-care provider so they could still access care should they need it during a second wave of a pandemic."</p>
<p>A coalition of family physicians, family health teams, university and college health services, community health and resource centres and urgent-care clinics is working with public-health officials on how these flu centres would be run. They are also discussing the conditions that would trigger the establishment of the flu centres, which could be ready to operate within 48 to 72 hours of being activated.</p>
<p>"There are multiple data sources that we would probably use to make an informed decision about when to trigger them," said Sherry Nigro, the manager responsible for pandemic planning at Ottawa Public Health. Such sources include the number of patients visiting hospital emergency rooms with flu-like symptoms and the amount of flu-related calls being fielded by the city's flu hotline.</p>

</p>
<p>THE premier had barely finished his resignation address Thursday when observers started wondering who would be a good fit to fill Gary Doer's shoes.</p>
<p>All potential replacements are cabinet ministers and most are familiar to Manitobans. None was available to speak on Thursday as the party decided to give the day to Doer and his accomplishments -- and not insider politics. Here are the possible contenders:</p>
<p>Finance Minister Greg Selinger</p>
<p>Selinger, a former St. Boniface city councillor, was first elected as an MLA in 1999 and has served as finance minister since. Long considered by political observers as a front-runner, he has not indicated he will seek the leadership. He's bilingual, well-spoken, a tough combatant in the legislature. "If Selinger does run, it should give us some indication that the books look good and that's really bad news for the Tories," one observer said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Theresa Oswald</p>
<p>First elected in 2003, the former teacher might be perhaps the first out of the blocks in the upcoming leadership race. The website draftoswald.blogspot.com popped up by midday Thursday promoting her as the province's first female premier. But how much involvement Oswald actually has with the site is unknown. Last year she asked that it be removed. She's managed the politically risky health portfolio "quite successfully," said University of Manitoba political scientist Paul Thomas, who said Oswald "seems to be down-to-earth and very human in the way she presents herself and her ideas." She will face a tough test this fall on the front lines of the government's defences against the looming second wave of the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Elmwood MLA Bill Blaikie</p>
<p>The former longtime MP was elected last spring in a byelection and until Thursday was considered a shoo-in for cabinet. Now he could toss his hat into a leadership race -- something that had been speculated when he decided to end his political retirement and run for provincial office. A preacher prior to politics, Blaikie wouldn't give the opposition much to shoot at in terms of ethical concerns, said U of M political scientist Jared Wesley.</p>
<p>Intergovernmental Affairs Minister Steve Ashton</p>
<p>The Thompson MLA was first elected in 1981 and is popular throughout the North. His daughter is recently elected Churchill MP Niki Ashton. Not considered a front-runner but, given the fact the new leader will be elected by delegates -- not a membership vote -- he could play a role in deciding the outcome.</p>
<p>Competitiveness, Training and Trade Minister Andrew Swan</p>
<p>The Minto MLA and lawyer was elected in a 2004 byelection. He was elevated to cabinet more than a year ago and was considered to be a candidate for attorney general. Swan has been a rising star in the Doer cabinet. Some NDP insiders say that since he and Hugh McFadyen were both classmates at Silver Heights Collegiate, Swan could counter the youthful advantage the Tory leader has on his side.</p>
<p>There are also several NDP MLAs, including at least three cabinet ministers, who are said not to be running in the next provincial election, which is slated for October 2011.</p>
<p>In an earlier interview with the Free Press, he had planned a cabinet shuffle for this fall, but with his resignation, likely to take effect in early October, that shuffle will be done by his successor.</p>
<p>"I would recommend to the incoming person that there's an opportunity here for renewal not just in leadership, but the team in cabinet," Doer said. "We have a ton of talent.</p>
<p>"If you continue to renew and be energetic and govern in a new way for all people, the party will be in very good shape and the province will be in very good shape."</p>
<p>He said a new leader brings in new people and they bring in new ideas.</p>
<p>"You cannot just stand on, 'Oh, I won so elect me again.' You need renewal."</p>

<p>FORMER ALBERTA PREMIER RALPH KLEIN</p>
<p>'During premiers' conferences we put our political differences behind... He gave me a trip to see the polar bears at Churchill... It was a retirement gift'</p>
<p>B.C. PREMIER GORDON CAMPBELL</p>
<p>'I think he's someone who looks for solutions... who's been willing to look at the world and deal with the facts that are there on behalf of the people of his province'</p>

<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Les MacPherson's recent column, Flu pandemic panic leaves sanity behind, especially after reading H1N1 pay for MDs (SP, Aug. 22).</p>
<p>Give me a break!</p>
<p>The article states that physicians may be paid more than $500 an hour for night shifts spent working with patients who have H1N1 influenza. To top it off, discussions will begin next week.</p>
<p>In order for physicians to work with H1N1 patients, a positive diagnosis must be made, which involves the expertise of medical laboratory technologists who perform myriad tests on specimens from patients from the entire Saskatoon Health Region. Doctors and nurses are not the only health-care workers involved in this influenza pandemic.</p>
<p>By the way, we at the Service Employees International Union have been without a collective agreement since April 1, 2008.</p>

<p>Children are 14 times more likely to be sickened by swine flu than adults 60 and older, the age group that is typically the most at risk for influenza, according to a U.S. study of the disease.</p>
<p>Kids aged five to 14 became ill with swine flu, also known as H1N1, at a rate of 147 per 100,000 people, according to the study of 1,557 confirmed illnesses, including seven deaths, in Chicago from April to July, months when the flu virus usually doesn't spread.</p>
<p>The findings were reported Thursday by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.</p>
<p>U.S. health officials are planning a vaccination campaign that will focus on those who are disproportionately affected by H1N1, which include children, pregnant women and adults with underlying health conditions.</p>
<p>A separate CDC study from New Zealand showed swine flu targeted younger people and dominated other virus strains after circulating for one month during the winter, when influenza is more active.</p>
<p>The highest concentration of cases occurred in South Auckland, where people went to the doctor with flu symptoms at a rate of 1,308 per 100,000 in a single week, from July 6 to July 12.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian doctors probing the worst cases of swine flu in Canada have made a striking finding: 40-year-olds, many previously healthy, appear most at risk of developing severe H1N1 disease.</p>
<p>The finding is based on global reports of illness and case reports from critically ill patients in intensive-care units across the country. The investigation confirms the virus behind the first flu pandemic of the 21st century does not fit the typical patterns of influenza.</p>
<p>Significant, doctors say, is its ability to cause serious disease in previously healthy people.</p>
<p>"Although there are certain people who become critically ill with this virus that have co-morbidities, it has been remarkable for its ability to cause illness in patients who don't have chronic illness and are not weakened from some other medical condition," says Dr. Robert Fowler, assistant professor in the departments of medicine and critical care medicine at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>"That's novel. It makes it difficult, therefore, to define a segment of the population that is so-called high-risk and should maybe therefore be considered for vaccination before other groups, or potentially for early therapy before other groups," said Fowler, a member of the Canadian Critical Care Trials Group.</p>
<p>The researchers are working with the Public Health Agency of Canada and various provincial groups to try to learn more about what predicts severe illness with H1N1, "and what we're going to need to treat patients as they come in greater numbers in the fall," Fowler said.</p>

<p>The researchers are working with the Public Health Agency of Canada and various provincial groups to try to learn more about what predicts severe illness with H1N1, "and what we're going to need to treat patients as they come in greater numbers in the fall," Fowler said.</p>
<p>The picture that is emerging shows:</p>
<p>-Of those who have become critically ill with H1N1, the most commonly affected age is around 40. "They're surprisingly young," Fowler told Canwest News Service. Seasonal flu normally is most dangerous to the very young and those over age 65.</p>
<p>Among critically ill cases of H1N1, there is a spike in numbers in the under-five group. But the median age for severe illness requiring critical care is around 40.</p>
<p>Experts suspect people over 65 have some immunity to the pandemic virus, because they were likely exposed to a distant cousin of H1N1 that circulated in the 1950s.</p>
<p>-Only about a third of patients who required critical care had a major underlying illness. Normally people most at risk of life-threatening flu complications are those with chronic underlying health problems. With H1N1, most critically ill patients "will have something on their past medical history list, but often not that big a deal," Fowler said.</p>
<p>-Patients who become critically ill frequently develop severe lung injury, requiring not just mechanical ventilation, "but really extraordinary forms of mechanical ventilation" for prolonged periods, up to weeks at a time, Fowler said.</p>
<p>-Critically ill patients often need to be heavily sedated, and frequently receive medications to completely relax their muscles so they don't fight or work against the ventilator.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Harper sails through an easy summer</b>

<p>MONTREAL</p>
<p>It is hard to think of a summer when a prime minister has had it as easy as Stephen Harper. Without a regular venue from which to rain on the Conservative parade, the opposition leaders vanished from the national scene for days and even weeks on end since Parliament adjourned last June.</p>
<p>In Quebec, Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe went missing for so long that rumours of his impending retirement were running rampant when he resurfaced (as he usually does) in mid-August.</p>
<p>Having shot blanks at the Conservatives for the first half of the year, Michael Ignatieff opted to keep his powder dry for most of the summer, presumably to concentrate on lining up his ducks for a fall election.</p>
<p>As for the NDP, it was largely preoccupied with its bi-annual convention.</p>
<p>A dry opposition season was compounded by an exceptionally storm-free Canadian political horizon.</p>
<p>No unforeseen major crisis interfered with the Prime Minister's agenda; many of the controversies that preoccupied the media either lacked traction with a distracted public or did not have enough merits to have lasting power. Wafergate -- as the 10-day debate over the fate of Harper's communion wafer was dubbed -- was a case in point. Even the premiers -- who usually use their annual summer retreat to engage in a ritual round of federal bashing -- took a pass when they met in Regina earlier this month. Some of them actually had kind words for Harper's government.</p>
<p>The distribution of billions of dollars of federal stimulus money has at least bought a lot of goodwill.</p>
<p>A bridge-rebuilding ministerial mission to China earlier this month went without a major hitch.</p>
<p>On the two fronts of most concern for the government and the public, things took a timid turn for the better.</p>
<p>The economy continued to sport more green shoots, inspiring much optimism in many forecasting quarters.</p>
<p>And while it may only be a reprieve, the H1N1 virus was sufficiently contained to allow for the normal reopening of Canadian schools.</p>
<p>Harper lost two of his senior communications staffers this summer and yet rarely have so few filters seemed to stand between his message and the public.</p>
<p>On that score, his trip to the North last week was a public relations success. The photo opportunities alone had to be a dream come true for the Conservative image-makers who are currently crafting the party's election ads.</p>
<p>As a bonus, while Harper basked in the spotlight, many commentators were sharpening their claws on the visibility-challenged Ignatieff -- deemed by most as the political loser of the summer season.</p>
<p>The polls though tell a more ambiguous story. While they confirm the momentum of Ignatieff's honeymoon as leader is spent, they do not show a solid transfer of affection to the Conservatives.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, an Ipsos poll reported a double-digit Conservatives lead on the Liberals but its findings were offset by two others -- done over the same period but with larger samples -- that came up with a statistical tie between the two main parties.</p>
<p>According to Harris/Decima and Ekos, the end of an otherwise splendid government summer finds the Conservatives scoring five or six points below their 37.7 election score, going nowhere fast in Quebec and involved in highly competitive battles in most other regions outside the Prairies.</p>
<p>With the going about as good as it can get for a government, the Prime Minister still has a hard time catching a break in public opinion.</p>

<p>Beat Disease With Nutrition</p>
<p>Info - With the school season upon us, calgary-based dietitian Kim wagner jones recently e-mailed me with some information on how people can strengthen their bodies to prevent catching h1n1 or any other illness.</p>
<p>The idea is to boost the immune system by incorporating disease-fighting nutrients.</p>
<p>Here are some of her tips: - Eating regular meals containing nutritious foods on a daily basis is fundamental to promoting optimal health. every nutritious meal should contain generous quantities of fruits, vegetables and good-quality lean protein. Breakfast is not optional and it must always include fruit. - Make time mid-day and at supper to recharge your immune system with a powerhouse of nutrients. your plate or lunch bag should be loaded up with colourful vegetables and some fruit for dessert. Include whole grains and a lean protein such as turkey, bison, lean beef, fish or cottage cheese. - Stay well-hydrated by drinking ample water throughout the day. Keep a favourite cup, mug or water bottle nearby to provide a constant reminder. send kids to school with a water bottle and encourage them to drink it all before they get home. - Make a plan. ten minutes of menu planning before a trip to the grocery store will ensure you have the necessary ingredients.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Camrose barbecue fires up to support pork farmers</b>

</p>
<p>Organizers of the world's longest barbecue are heating up the coals for another world-record cooking event--this time in support of the province's ailing pork producers.</p>
<p>The event was launched in 2004 by Dallas and Kyle Ramey to support farmers, ranchers and the Alberta beef industry during the BSE crisis. The last one was held in 2006.</p>
<p>"The unfortunate thing about what I do is, I hold crisis rallies," Dallas said on Wednesday. "The reason for this event is because people are really having hard times. We hope to raise awareness of the pork industry and hopefully clear up misconceptions that you can contract H1N1 from Alberta pork--we saw similar things with the BSE issue.</p>
<p>"We want to let people know that Alberta pork is safe and showcase the people who work in the industry and all the good things they do. Hopefully, we will raise enough awareness to convince some of the pork producers to stick in the business, because there are so many of them leaving every day."</p>
<p>The event started Wednesday and ends at 10 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p>Over the Wednesday lunch hour, a steady lineup of people pulled into the UFA parking lot for a pulled pork sandwich and drink. While some volunteers wearing black aprons served up the barbecue onto buns, others shredded the next batch of cooked pork with forks and spatulas.</p>
<p>Ramey said the beef barbecues he organized got worldwide attention and received positive feedback from Alberta beef producers.</p>
<p>"Obviously, beef is a bigger industry in Alberta than pork, but they are both as equally important. I think we were able to raise awareness and the feedback from the beef producers was positive and it did convince some to hang in there. We are hoping for similar feedback for this one."</p>
<p>The event is in the parking lot of the Camrose UFA, at 4904 39th St.</p>

</p>
<p>Union leader Réjean Parent borrowed a line from Hamlet to describe the Quebec government's education plan yesterday.</p>
<p>"Words, words, words," the head of the Centrale Syndicale du Québec said at a news conference marking the end of the summer vacation.</p>
<p>Flanked by fellow union leaders, Parent lambasted the Charest government for inaction on dropout rates, violence in schools, the quality of French-language instruction and the accommodation of special-needs students.</p>
<p>Parent gave the province's tepid response to the H1N1 threat as an example of what he called a "lack of firmness" in Quebec's resolve.</p>
<p>"Concretely, what do we do? How do we prepare?" he said.</p>
<p>The criticisms came just as Education Minister Michelle Courchesne, is supposed to deliver a long-awaited action plan on keeping kids in school.</p>
<p>Kim Ledoux, a spokesperson for the minister who said in June the plan would be ready "for back-to-school time," could not say yesterday when it would be published.</p>
<p>The province's dropout rate, which rose from 26 per cent in 2000 to 29 per cent in 2007, is not getting the attention and action it merits, the union leaders charged.</p>
<p>"It's false to say we haven't done anything," Ledoux said, citing the action plan, improvements in the teacher-to-student ratio and a $100-million investment for special-needs teachers.</p>
<p>But Parent said an action plan misses the point.</p>
<p>"Our education system is not working for over a third of its students," he said, citing Quebec's graduation rate, stuck at about 70 per cent since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>"We need action, not more words," Parent said.</p>
<p>In neighbouring Ontario, the graduation rate has climbed nine points to 77 per cent since 2003, with a target of 85 per cent set for 2012.</p>
<p>Manon Bernard and Jean Falardeau, presidents of the Fédération des syndicats de l'enseignement and the Fédération des professionnelles et professionels de l'éducation respectively, complained that special-needs students are being "left to their own devices."</p>
<p>"What are the guidelines? What support is there? How will special-needs students be integrated?" asked Bernard, who said she will be watching closely to see if the province follows through on its promise to reduce Grade 3 class sizes by 20 per cent in low-income areas this school year.</p>
<p>Falardeau said the number of students with behaviour problems, autism, learning disabilities and other challenges is on the rise, while the number of specialists being hired to handle them - 178 in the past three years - is insufficient.</p>
<p>The result: troubled students waiting four to five months to see a psychologist, and most never seeing a guidance counsellor at all.</p>
<p>"The students are often left to their own devices," added Diane Cinq-Mars, president of the Fédération du personnel de soutien scolaire.</p>
<p>"We have to stop being firemen. We're often reacting too late, arriving when the solution is already unacceptable to the child or parents."</p>
<p>Ledoux countered that the provincial government has coughed up $100 million, enough money to hire 1,800 new special needs teachers, since 2006.</p>
<p>Schools across Quebec welcome the province's 1.8 million students back from summer vacation today, tomorrow and next week.</p>

<p>Every weekday on FullComment.com, the blog of the National Post comment section, Chris Selley summarizes the offerings of Canada's leading pundits. Printed below are excerpts from Wednesday's Full Pundit compilation. A SLOW, EASY SUMMER IN OTTAWA</p>
<p>The Toronto Star's Chantal Hebert thinks the polls, taken as a whole, show a very simple truth: that "the momentum of [Michael] Ignatieff's honeymoon as leader is spent," but that this has not resulted in "a solid transfer of affection to the Conservatives." This could be disturbing for Conservatives, however, considering the fact Stephen Harper has enjoyed what Hebert deems a very "easy" summer. There was no "unforeseen major crisis," she notes, and those crises that may have been foreseen -- H1N1 and the economy, most notably -- did not prove disastrous. All told, it seems all signs point to an ongoing political shouting match in which all parties pledge to make Parliament work while doing no such thing. Fun!</p>
<p>THE LIBERALS PONDER THE POLLS</p>
<p>In the Montreal Gazette, L. Ian MacDonald sinks his teeth into this week's Ipsos poll showing the Conservatives 11 points up on the Liberals -- which will, he says, "give the Liberals serious pause about the possibility of forcing an election." He concedes, however, that a Decima poll released the next day shows the Tories and Grits in a dead heat, but says "all that tells [the Liberals] is that, at best, they might form a weak minority government." Hmm. But they thought they were in a dead heat before, right? And yet some of them were still dying to hit the hustings. Sadly, we suspect the partisan minds in question will simply dismiss the Ipsos poll as an outlier and carry on.</p>
<p>WHY AMERICANS YELL AND WE COWER</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail's John Ibbitson provides a welcomely clear-eyed examination of the difference between Canadian and American political debates. More than anything else, he suggests, it's this: "Americans yell at each other in full confidence that their country is the finest</p>
<p>THE $2.5-MILLION APOLOGY</p>
<p>The Toronto Sun's Peter Worthington believes the treatment Suaad Hagi Mohamud received at the hands of the Canadian High Commission in Nairobi was "unconscionable," but considers her lawsuit against the Canadian government "unseemly" because "in many cases when litigants insist 'it's not about the money,' it's only about the money." Well, isn't that charming. Perhaps Worthington can check himself into a Kenyan jail for nine days in an attempt to quantify her ordeal. place on Earth and that it will always endure. Canadians keep their voices down for fear an honest argument would wreck the country." While this is certainly understandable given our countries' different histories and circumstances, it is also nothing to be proud of.</p>
<p>ALBERTA'S PLAN: CUT SPENDING AND PRAY</p>
<p>The Edmonton Journal's editorialists, and the Journal's Graham Thomson, shake their heads with a mixture of sadness and righteous fury at the suddenly dire, if not Don Gettyesque, state of Alber ta's finances. And they are particularly unimpressed with Premier Ed Stelmach's plan to deal with the situation, which they see as basically "rid[ing] out the storm in the hope of smoother sailing ahead," as Thomson puts it -- or, as the Journal less charitably puts it, "whistling past the graveyard."</p>

</div><div>By Mia Rabson    </div>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal health minister's claim First Nations are adequately supplied for a widespread outbreak of H1N1 this fall is "nonsense," says one Manitoba chief.</p>
<p>That is just one of the things Garden Hill Chief David Harper plans to tell a parliamentary health committee Friday. It is the second special meeting of the committee this month. Both were called for by opposition MPs who say the government is not acting quickly enough to be prepared for a potential widespread outbreak of H1N1 this fall.</p>
<p>Harper is one of several Manitobans expected to testify at the committee about the experience of his reserve and others in Island Lake, which were hit hard by H1N1 in the spring.</p>
<p>Also listed as witnesses are Manitoba chief medical officer of health Dr. Joel Kettner and Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs Grand Chief Ron Evans.</p>
<p>Manitoba MP Joy Smith chairs the committee.</p>
<p>Harper said he wants to get across to the health minister and MPs that he does not feel things have improved since the spring. "We don't want to go through what we went through again," he said.</p>
<p>Garden Hill and St. Theresa Point were hit hard by H1N1 in May and June. Hundreds of people were sick in the two reserves, and dozens of patients were flown to Winnipeg for emergency medical treatment. Manitoba sent several doctors to the Island Lake region to help out.</p>
<p>Harper said when he checked this week there were 154 doses of antiviral medication available at the nursing station. The U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention recommends an adult receive five doses to treat someone who already has symptoms of influenza, which means the antivirals in Garden Hill are enough to treat about 30 adults.</p>
<p>Harper said he plans to also ask the government to make plans to have planes on standby to fly out patients who are sick, and to have doctors ready to spend weeks at a time in the communities during flu season.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan's agriculture minister feels the name calling needs to stop.</p>
<p>Arguing that the influenza pandemic has wrongly marred the pork industry's image, Bob Bjornerud has banded together with counterparts from the U.S. and Mexico to urge that the flu virus be referred to as H1N1, not swine flu, as it was originally labelled.</p>
<p>A joint statement regarding the flu terminology was signed by delegates from the three countries at the recent Tri-National Agriculture Accord in Gimli, Man.</p>
<p>While H1N1 influenza has taken hold as the official name, it's sometimes still referred to as swine flu, said Bjornerud.</p>
<p>"The hog industry, as we know, doesn't need any more bad luck going on and I think it was a poor choice of names for influenza," Bjornerud said.</p>
<p>He was referring to trade issues with the United States and the impact of the high Canadian dollar hampering the swine industry.</p>
<p>Summer is barbecue season and the pork industry does not want consumers to shy away from their products, he said.</p>
<p>Officials have reiterated that properly handled and cooked pork does not present a threat to consumers.</p>

<p>Manitoba First Nation leaders whose communities were hit hard by H1N1 influenza this spring will tell their stories to the Parliamentary health committee Friday.</p>
<p>Opposition members of the committee have called for the second special meeting this month on H1N1 planning and preparedness. The opposition MPs were dismayed at the first meeting, when Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq announced after an hour she couldn't stay any longer, because they did not get a chance to ask the minister about the pandemic's impact on First Nations.</p>
<p>The Liberals and New Democrats said they wanted more time to talk to her about the problems experienced by First Nations, particularly in the Island Lake region of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Chiefs of two of those reserves are scheduled to testify at Friday's meeting, as are Manitoba chief public health officer Dr. Joel Kettner and Ron Evans, grand chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.</p>
<p>Thus far, the Public Health Agency of Canada has not determined why communities such as St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill have seen a disproportionate number of cases of H1N1. They are looking to see if there are genetic factors involved in the outbreaks there or if they were due only to the poor living conditions and a high rate of chronic health problems.</p>

<p>Don't wait until H1N1 influenza finds your family, says Vancouver Island Health Authority's chief medical health officer, Richard Stanwick. Start preparing now to reduce any impact on your family.</p>
<p>What's not known is when - and to what degree - the H1N1 pandemic will hit. The return to school could see a spike in flu cases ahead of the usual mid-winter flu season, according to Stanwick.</p>
<p>"Kids are the prime reason for the spread of a virus through the community," says Stanwick, both a pediatrician and epidemiologist.</p>
<p>Coughing kids spread viruses among themselves and then take them home to potentially infect their parents. This is one argument for first immunizing school kids and their parents to stall the spread of H1N1. Usually, immunization programs first target the very old and very young, chronically ill, pregnant women and health care workers, he says.</p>
<p>"People who are sick need to stay home. You don't have to be there. Cemeteries are filled with irreplaceable people," Stanwick says. This not only applies to work or school, but family visits, playdates and community events.</p>
<p>Your family's best defence against H1N1 is to stay healthy, he says. This includes the obvious - eat right, get enough sleep and exercise. "If people need a reason to stop smoking, this is it," he adds.</p>
<p>The key to combating any flu is frequent hand-washing, Stanwick adds.</p>
<p>Viruses can last on an unwashed hand for minutes and hard surfaces for hours. Inadvertently touching your eyes or nose introduces the virus to your body.</p>
<p>Use soap and water or a hand sanitizer for 20 seconds - a good gauge is as long as it takes to sing Happy Birthday, he says. Parents using, for example, public transit can carry alcohol gel packs or wipes when wall-sanitizers or soap and water are not handy.</p>
<p>Avoid coughing into the bare hand. Use a handkerchief. A better alternative, according to Stanwick, is coughing into the crook of your arm - an area less likely to be in contact with others or your own eyes or nose.</p>
<p>Now is the time to stockpile household cleaning supplies and a seven-day supply of non-perishable food, Stanwick says. Renew any prescriptions early.</p>
<p>There could be shortages during a flu crisis. Parents - sick themselves or home with a sick child - might be unable to leave the house to shop.</p>
<p>Further, he says, now is also the time to set up online banking to avoid unnecessary outings.</p>
<p>Plan for alternatives for child care, Stanwick says. Decide which working parent's medical plan is the most amenable to staying home with a sick family member. Also, if possible, arrange now with your employer to work from home to avoid exposure or to care for a family member.</p>
<p>Think twice before booking the family's spring break holiday, Stanwick says.</p>
<p>"It's a bit of a risk. We don't know how other countries will respond," he says.</p>
<p>In a virulent outbreak, other countries might close their borders or confine visitors to their hotels, Stanwick says. Buy cancellation insurance if booking a trip now for what could well be the height of the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Ultimately, surviving the flu pandemic requires a "collective effort," he says. This means neighbours should plan ahead to assist each other as needed during a flu pandemic, as with any disaster such as an earthquake.</p>
<p>"It's your neighbour who's going to dig you out, not the fire and police," Stanwick says.</p>
<p>HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK OF FLU</p>
<p>- Wash hands often with soap and warm water or use a hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>- Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue when coughing. Cough or sneeze into your sleeve.</p>
<p>- Refrain from touching eyes and nose</p>
<p>- Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables. Get lots of sleep and regular exercise.</p>
<p>- Get an annual flu shot and an H1N1 one when available.</p>
<p>- Stay home if you are sick or feel unwell.</p>
<p>- Avoid crowds.</p>
<p>START BUYING NOW</p>
<p>- Non-perishable food items, such as canned or frozen soups, juices, fruits and vegetables, canned fish, crackers, peanut butter</p>
<p>- Household cleaning supplies, such as bleach or disinfectant, dishwashing soap and paper towels.</p>
<p>- Basic over-the-counter medications such as acetamino-phen (Tylenol or Tempra) for fever. No Aspirin for those under 19 years.</p>
<p>- Prescription medications (two to three months' supply, if possible).</p>

</div><div>Jodie Sinnema </div>
<div>Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>803 words</div><div>26 August 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal </div>
</p>
<p>Patients who need hospital beds after heading to emergency for care should see their waiting times cut in half in the next three years, says the boss of Alberta's health superboard.</p>
<p>"It can be done, but only if we move quickly and decisively," Stephen Duckett, CEO of Alberta Health Services, told the Rotary Club of Calgary on Tuesday, according to his speaking notes. "We cannot and should not be intimidated by the size of the challenge."</p>
<p>On the same day Premier Ed Stelmach talked about a $6.9-billion projected provincial deficit that critics say will inevitably cut into the health system, Duckett said waiting time targets for emergency visits and surgery will be published in the next few weeks. Current waiting times -- some of which Duckett described as unacceptable --will also be released in a quarterly report.</p>
<p>Alberta's wait-list registry, launched in 2003 to allow patients to compare waiting times between the old health regions for different procedures, such as hip replacements, has been out of commission since earlier this year. The recorded waiting times were inaccurate, a spokesman for Alberta Health and Wellness said.</p>
<p>Patients who have had elective or cancer surgery postponed at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, or those experiencing burgeoning waits for MRIs at the Grey Nuns and Misericordia hospitals, all because of budget restrictions, haven't been able to find out how those waiting times compare.</p>
<p>Last November, Edmonton hospital patients had to wait 22 to 28 hours from the time they walked in to emergency doors to the time they were transferred out of the ER to a proper bed.</p>
<p>Dave Eggen, executive director of Friends of Medicare, questioned how the province will reduce waiting times when the health region already faces an expected $1.1-billion deficit.</p>
<p>"Anything short of a magic act couldn't reduce actual wait times without increasing capacity throughout the acute-care system," Eggen said.</p>
<p>Commenting on Duckett's speech, Eggen said: "I don't know what he has in mind, but let's not pretend you can do it without building your actual capacity."</p>
<p>In his speech, Duckett said nurses will help bring down those waiting times by offering "discharge counselling" to patients after they've been treated by a doctor. They could arrange home-care assistance or a prescription, Duckett said.</p>
<p>Nurses could also help determine if the patient doesn't even need care in emergency, he said.</p>
<p>Waiting times will also be brought down over the winter months by implementing a free vaccination campaign against the H1N1 flu virus, Duckett said.</p>
<p>But he said while there may be a shift in the balance of hospital beds to community-based care--for example, the closure of mental health beds at Alberta Hospital Edmonton in favour of community-based programs-- patients will always come first, he said.</p>
<p>"No hospital spaces will be closed unless and until community-based beds and services are in place. Full stop. Period."</p>
<p>Stelmach echoed Duckett's remarks. He said the decision to abandon plans to renovate two old buildings at Alberta Hospital and replace closed beds with beds in the community reflect what people in the mental-health community want.</p>
<p>"In all honesty, let's start putting the patient first," Stelmach said. "I think many people would sooner live in a community-based (facility) as opposed to being institutionalized."</p>
<p>Eggen said that explanation doesn't work.</p>
<p>"Closing those beds is not a policy innovation, it's a cut," Eggen said. "Mr. Stelmach should refrain from being doctor, pretending his cuts are in the best interest to patients when he's talking about closing beds and putting people into the community."</p>
<p>Eggen said Duckett needs to stand up for public health.</p>
<p>"The temptation is very strong to cut and Mr. Duckett will get instructions to cut from the Alberta government. He needs to be ready for that and he needs to stand firm."</p>
<p>Stelmach wouldn't speculate how the projected deficit could affect upcoming contract negotiations with the nurses'union, but said nurses are a vital part of health delivery.</p>
<p>But Liberal MLA Laurie Blakeman questioned how the province could negotiate an hourly fee for doctors who are to be part of the flu pandemic plan. The fee for an overnight shift could be $518 an hour.</p>
<p>"Where is that pot of money where they're able to pull that kind of money from?" Blakeman asked.</p>
<p>"I think what we're going to hear down the road is 'Sorry, we spent so much money on H1N1 that we're going to have to cut even more of your health services, and your deficit is going to be even higher in health care.' "</p>

<p>Long-term tamoxifen use linked to second cancer</p>
<p>A study suggests long-term use of tamoxifen is linked to an increased risk of a second type of breast cancer.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers looked at more than 700 women who had been diagnosed with breast cancer and compared them to nearly 400 diagnosed with both a first and second breast cancer.</p>
<p>Tamoxifen is an estrogen-blocking drug researchers say has been shown to reduce the risk of dying of breast cancer.</p>
<p>Researchers found women who received tamoxifen for five or more years lowered their risk of developing the more common type of breast cancer that responds to estrogen-blocking therapy.</p>
<p>But the study found the risk of another rare subtype of the disease increased by more than 400 per cent.</p>
<p>Lead author Dr. Christopher Li says it's important to remember any treatment has both risks and benefits, and that tamoxifen has been shown to lower the risk of recurrent breast cancer in women.</p>
<p>Some parents may refuse pandemic vaccinations</p>
<p>A study says parents and health- care workers may refuse to vaccinate their children during a pandemic -- or get immunized themselves -- if they believe a vaccine's risks outweigh the benefits.</p>
<p>B.C. researchers asked people how willing they would be to accept a new vaccine during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Many said they wouldn't be vaccinated because of concerns about insufficient testing and safety.</p>
<p>Those who expressed a fondness for alternative medicine were far less likely to endorse vaccination.</p>
<p>And some said they could simply protect themselves against infection through hand washing and a healthy diet.</p>
<p>Researchers say while those measures are important, they are not enough to prevent illness.</p>
<p>The researchers say people who refuse vaccinations put other members of the public at greater risk. And with an outbreak of the H1N1 virus expected this fall, they stress the importance of having people vaccinated.</p>
<p>The vaccine against H1N1 is currently in production and testing, and should be available by the end of December.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea increases risk of death 45 per cent</p>
<p>Severe nightly episodes of interrupted breathing during sleep double the risk of death for middle-age men, according to a study being called the largest conducted on the disorder.</p>
<p>Even men with moderate sleep apnea -- anywhere from 15 to 30 instances of oxygen deprivation per hour -- appear to be 45 per cent more likely to die from any cause than those who have no nighttime breathing problems.</p>
<p>As many as 1 in 4 men is believed to suffer from sleep apnea, researchers said.</p>
<p>Sleep apnea, typically characterized by loud snoring, is often linked to obesity. Women also are affected by the disorder but to a lesser degree.</p>
<p>The study, led by Johns Hopkins pulmonologist Dr. Naresh M. Punjabi, is published online in the Public Library of Science, Medicine.</p>
<p>Men with apnea were more likely to die regardless of age, gender, race, weight or whether they were a current or former smoker, or had other medical conditions.</p>
<p>Researchers found that repeated episodes of apnea resulted in oxygen deprivation where blood oxygen levels dropped below 90 per cent.</p>
<p>If the heart doesn't get enough oxygen, it doesn't pump well. As few as 11 minutes a night spent essentially holding one's breath -- 2 per cent of an average night's sleep of seven hours -- caused the risk of death to double, Punjabi found.</p>
<p>Imitation promotes social bonding and friendship</p>
<p>If you want someone to like you, try imitating their actions.</p>
<p>U.S. researchers say capuchin monkeys playing with a wiffle ball preferred the company of researchers who mimicked their motions over researchers who didn't.</p>
<p>The researchers say imitation promotes social bonding, encourages strangers to become friends and underpins the formation of social groups.</p>
<p>The study is in the current issue of Science.</p>

<p>There won't be any extra pay for Manitoba doctors should they find themselves on the front lines of an H1N1 flu outbreak this fall.</p>
<p>Manitoba won't follow Alberta's lead and offer physicians bonus rates to fight the pandemic. Both the Manitoba government and Doctors Manitoba, formerly the Manitoba Medical Association, say the current agreement addresses compensation for after-hours work.</p>
<p>"The contract was finalized in September 2008 and we expect that this structure will be sufficient for our ongoing H1N1 response," a Manitoba Health spokesperson said.</p>
<p>The Alberta Medical Association is working on a "physician financial support program" with proposed rates of $518.45 an hour for night shifts, $403.24 an hour for evenings and weekends, and$259.23 an hour for weekday shifts.</p>
<p>Doctors who don't opt for the hourly rate could be paid on a fee-for-service basis or under a guaranteed salary. The scheme would apply if a public health emergency was declared.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan health officials are in discussions about compensating physicians for working in the event of an H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>

</div><div>Tony Lofaro   </div>

</p>
<p>As part of a political protest, piglets were abandoned Tuesday outside the Ottawa constituency office of Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty and Agriculture Minister Leona Dombrowsky's office in Belleville.</p>
<p>The piglets were housed in makeshift wooden pens, and some food and water had been left for them. At both offices, posters left behind criticized Ontario's handling of the H1N1 swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The posters appeared to have been left by disgruntled pork producers.</p>
<p>One sign read: "Due to misnaming an influenza swine flu, our industry has been devastated." The sign said farmers had lost the market for pork and were being forced to euthanize stock.</p>
<p>The piglets left outside McGuinty's office were turned over to the Ottawa Humane Society, which was to put them on a foster farm. In Belleville, humane society officials were also looking to place the piglets.</p>
<p>"Essentially abandoning animals is inappropriate and quite possibly, illegal," said Bruce Roney, executive director of the Ottawa Humane Society. "It's to get attention to something, presumably, and that's not our concern. We just don't feel that animals should be used in this way."</p>
<p>OHS inspectors were to look into whether charges would be laid against the owner of the animals, although there was no evidence to indicate who the owner might be, Roney said.</p>
<p>No one from McGuinty's Kilborn Avenue office wanted to speak about Tuesday's incident, but Dombrowsky felt compelled to talk about what happened in Belleville.</p>
<p>"These poor defenceless little animals were left in front of my office, and, when the animal control officers came to pick them up, they found the animals to be very distressed," she said.</p>
<p>"I grew up on a farm, and I just know we would never abandon animals. I don't know any farmers in my community who would just abandon animals. I was just surprised (by the incident), and this goes beyond my experience as a farmer's daughter or an individual who knows a lot of farmers, or even as minister of agriculture."</p>
<p>She said that there were "challenges" in the pork industry, but added that the provincial government was working with the federal officials to help pork producers. Two weeks ago, the federal government pledged $92 million to the pork industry with a view to assist producers to get out of the business and to restructure farms so they become profitable.</p>
<p>She said the financial aid by the federal government was supported by the Canadian Pork Council.</p>
<p>"The Ontario Pork Industry Council is pleased that there is now a national program for their producers, so there is something out there to assist the industry as it goes through this very difficult time," she said.</p>

<p>THE acting head of the Southern Chiefs' Organization says First Nations readying for a second wave of H1N1 shouldn't forget the potential help from traditional medicine.</p>
<p>Acting grand chief Norman Bone said he wanted to promote the fact that First Nations have access to traditional remedies to improve their health and treat the flu and can take matters into their own hands, rather than wait for funding announcements.</p>
<p>"It's more taking a step, doing what we can for ourselves," he said, adding that the SCO would also welcome federal or provincial funding for traditional treatment, if an arrangement could be made.</p>
<p>Bone declined to say what types of roots, herbs or other remedies would be used to treat or prevent H1N1, based on the advice of elders. He said he's not suggesting people avoid vaccines in favour of traditional medicine: "What I'm also promoting is the use of both methods."</p>

</div><div>Jeff Bell </div>
<div>Times Colonist</div>
<div>718 words</div><div>25 August 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist </div>
</p>
<p>With the start of the 2009-10 school year approaching, health officials say B.C schools are unlikely to be closed due to the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Six B.C. schools had short-term, flu-related closures last spring, including Hans Helgesen Elementary in Metchosin, but increased knowledge about the virus in the months since has led to a different approach.</p>
<p>Dr. Perry Kendall, provincial health officer, said school closures earlier in the year were done "out of an abundance of caution" when not as much was known about the virus.</p>
<p>"We do not recommend routine school closures with this virus. It's similar to the normal influenza virus in terms of its impact and severity, so we expect the schools will stay open even if they are reporting relatively high levels of absenteeism."</p>
<p>Emphasizing basic hygiene and stressing the need to keep children with flu-like symptoms at home will be key measures for schools, Kendall said. He said school settings are more easily controlled than other gathering points in the community.</p>
<p>"The most likely reason for closing a school ... is probably because there is an insufficient number of teachers to operate a safe environment for the children."</p>
<p>Kendall said the H1N1 flu likely will begin to appear in schools as early as September.</p>
<p>"With back-to-school, what we know about the influenza virus is that typically the viruses are introduced into the younger population, who have no resistance. We can expect quite reasonably that when the kids come back to school they'll bring the virus back with them, and we'll see a sort of seasonal flu outbreak -- only we'll see it probably in the fall rather than in the winter and spring."</p>
<p>He stressed that the experience from around the world -- most recently from such countries as Australia, New Zealand, Chile and Argentina -- is that the H1N1 virus seen so far can be considered much closer to a moderate flu outbreak than any sort of "worst-case scenario."</p>
<p>School absenteeism hasn't been much above normal in either Australia or New Zealand.</p>
<p>"The big difference is that if you were born before 1957, it does look as if you have an innate immunity from having met previously, when you were younger, circulating H1N1 viruses, which gives you some resistance to this one."</p>
<p>Kendall said that in B.C., only two per cent of H1N1 cases have been in people older than 55, while 75 per cent of cases have been in people younger than 39.</p>
<p>There have been 42 serious cases in B.C. requiring hospitalization, Kendall said, and four deaths. The deaths have come in people with underlying conditions.</p>
<p>"To put that in perspective, in an ordinary flu year we may see anywhere between 200 and 800 deaths from influenza and its complications."</p>
<p>Those in the risk group for complications with H1N1 are similar to what is seen with regular seasonal influenza. It includes women in their second to third trimester or early post-partum period, people with underlying respiratory conditions like asthma, and people with cardiovascular disease and diabetes. The list can also include healthy children younger than five.</p>
<p>Kendall said Canada and other countries are anticipating an H1N1 vaccine that is currently under development but unlikely to be licensed for use until the end of October or sometime in November.</p>
<p>"So we'll get out vaccine at the end of November. Our plan is to have everybody who needs to be vaccinated with the appropriate number of doses by the end of December."</p>
<p>Those in risk groups for complications should consider establishing a "flu plan" in co-operation with their doctors, said Dr. Bonnie Henry of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Comprehensive information on H1N1 has been posted at www.gov.bc.ca[http://www.gov.bc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca]. HealthLink B.C. is also available with information by dialing 8-1-1.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Farm cash takes a hit</b>
</div><div>Angela Hall </div>
<div>The Leader-Post</div>

</p>
<p>Saskatchewan farmers brought in less cash from the market over the first half of 2009 compared to the same period last year, despite some good news in the crop sector, according to new Statistics Canada data released Monday.</p>
<p>Crop sales remained strong in early 2009 as producers made hay off the large 2008 crop, with crop receipts up 1.9 per cent. But livestock receipts took a hit and declined more than eight per cent, in part due to hog receipts that fell from the already low levels of last year.</p>
<p>Including government program payments, total Saskatchewan farm cash receipts declined two per cent to $4.76 billion for the January to June 2009 period, compared to the same six months last year, Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>Greg Marshall, president of the Agricultural Producers Association of Saskatchewan, said the dip in overall receipts is a concern, especially with ongoing challenges that may not be short-lived, such as a new U.S. labelling law affecting livestock exports from Canada.</p>
<p>While farmers are trying to remain optimistic about the prospects of a good fall harvest despite a late start to the growing season and questions about quality, the situation for cattle and hog producers is a worrisome one, said Marshall.</p>
<p>"Feed will be an issue this fall, going into the fall. Good quality hay is simply not around. That may be offset if there is a frost because cereals will get cut for feed," he said. "But with the trade issues in livestock it's just very worrisome. The livestock industry is changing dramatically."</p>
<p>The Statistics Canada report noted a number of other factors that are also impacting the livestock sector, including inventory reductions, the economic crisis that put downward pressure on the U.S. demand for live animals and the H1N1 flu pandemic. Originally dubbed swine flu, the moniker helped drive down hog prices just as producers were anticipating a much-needed recovery.</p>
<p>Nationally, farm cash receipts fell 1.4 per cent from January to June when compared to 2008, largely due to a 32.7-per-cent drop in program payments that offset single-digit increases in crop and livestock receipts of 2.4 per cent and 1.6 per cent, respectively.</p>
<p>Gail-Ann Breese of Statistics Canada said crop receipts are significantly higher than the previous five-year average.</p>
<p>"It's mainly the marketings that are driving the increase in crop receipts of the first half of this year," she said, noting that prices are down from the peak they hit in 2008 but still remain above recent historical levels.</p>
<p>Hog receipts increased 10 per cent nationally based on stronger prices, but last year the hog receipts were the lowest since 1999, Breese said. Cattle receipts declined three per cent despite improved market prices, as fewer animals were sold for export or slaughtered domestically, Statistics Canada said.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada noted that the measure of farm cash receipts reflects gross revenue for farm businesses, not their bottom lines, which would also include expenses and loans and depreciation of assets.</p>

</p>
<p>Those interested in experiencing First Nations culture will have an opportunity starting today.</p>
<p>The Cowessess First Nation is hosting its third annual cultural gathering on the old RCMP firing range located near the Paul Dojack centre in northwest Regina. The event will continue until Friday.</p>
<p>"Starting at 10 a.m., on most days, there will be healer sessions, where people will have an opportunity to see a First Nations healer," said Alvin Delorme, tribal manager for Cowessess.</p>
<p>The event is open to the public. Delorme added that it's an individual's choice to participate in any of the ceremonies.</p>
<p>Delorme said the gatherings are about providing people with an opportunity to access traditional and modern medicine.</p>
<p>For example, a person can access the services of a traditional healer in the morning, and in the afternoon attend a seniors' foot clinic.</p>
<p>"We're incorporating a bit of western-style (medicine) because of diabetes," explained Delorme.</p>
<p>Information booths on H1N1 and HIV/AIDS will set up for anyone wishing to access that type of information.</p>
<p>Delorme said the event began two years ago as part of an informational and traditional healing opportunity for residential school survivors.</p>
<p>"Urban aboriginal people don't have access to traditional resources (and) to elders," said Delorme. "It's very important that we make First Nations culture available to urban people."</p>
<p>He said Cowessess committed to hosting the event for four years and this year represents year three in that commitment. It was at the first event that Cowessess partnered with Regina Police Service and Eagle Moon Health with the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region.</p>
<p>Delorme said this year's event will have some changes.</p>
<p>"Each day we have a different ceremony. We have the ghost dance, horse dance, rattle dance, chicken dance, but not necessarily in that order. When we say 'dance,' it's a ceremony," said Delorme. "The ceremonies are new this year. We didn't do them the last two years we've done this so we're excited about this third year. For me, this will be the first time seeing these big ceremonies."</p>
<p>Also new this year is a one-day competition powwow on Wednesday.</p>
<p>"In the previous years we held a round dance," said Delorme. "Traditionally, round dances are supposed to be held when there is snow on the ground and last year we started our round dance in August and this year we don't want to be responsible for a cold winter!"</p>
<p>More information on the gathering can be found on the Cowessess website (www.cowessess.ca[http://www.cowessess.ca]).</p>

</p>
<p>Pharmacists and paramedics could be called on to help inject the H1N1 vaccine this fall alongside nurses and doctors as part of a provincial plan to protect as many Albertans as possible from the new flu strain.</p>
<p>"This is one potential," said John Tuckwell, spokesman for Alberta Health and Wellness. "The immunization is the best defence against the virus and so our goal is to get as many Albertans vaccinated as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>Pharmacists were given additional responsibilities in April 2007, allowing them to refill prescriptions, change drug therapies or administer injections without direct physician instruction as long as they take training courses and successfully apply for certification. About 300 pharmacists out of a total of just under 4,000 in Alberta are authorized to give injection drugs, the Alberta College of Pharmacists says.</p>
<p>Last week, it was revealed doctors could receive as much as $518 an hour to work at night during the pandemic, while nurses will receive no extra pay because they are not self-employed but under contract.</p>
<p>Tuckwell said the province is also looking into changing legislation to allow paramedics to give vaccinations under the provincial H1N1 pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"They have those kinds of skill sets already," Tuckwell said.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Joffe, an infectious disease expert at the Royal Alexandra Hospital who previously described the H1N1 pandemic as "the major health-care challenge of the last 40 years," said the more people helping, the better.</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50 million doses of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>

</p>
<p>With the recent announcement by the Alberta government that doctors would be paid in excess of $500 per hour to treat H1N1 flu patients, and nurses would be paid nothing more than their regular pay, I decided to do a little research into my growing suspicion that the H1N1 flu scare is just that--a scare.</p>
<p>I discovered that the "flu," in its various mutations and with its various complications, kills approximately 36,000 Americans each year, and kills 700 to 2,500 Canadians each year. According to Wikipedia, there have been a total of 2,702 deaths worldwide attributed to H1N1.Quite a difference!</p>
<p>I cannot say that H1N1 will not become a pandemic, but I wonder if this flu strain has been exaggerated into a monster for political reasons. Certainly, the statistics do not support the fear that has been generated either by government medical experts or the media. So what is going on here?</p>
<p>As to why doctors in Alberta would be paid a significant salary to attend to H1N1 patients, but nurses would not, I have to question what is going on. Surely, if the government feels that H1N1 is a dreaded disease, anyone who serves the public and is in the line of danger should be equally compensated for facing that danger. Perhaps this government, as it has done in the past in other situations, is simply using a perceived health threat to sow dissent and distract the public from focusing on the real health-care issues.</p>

<p>Would someone please explain why doctors should be paid up to $518.45 per hour during an H1N1 outbreak, when we are having to cut the number of RNs to save money?</p>
<p>RNs are trained in many diagnostic procedures and obviously have more contact with disease. If we are to pay "danger pay" to doctors, maybe we should employ more, not fewer, RNs who will work because they have a passion and expect only a fair wage.</p>
<p>Since nurses are no longer allowed to voice their opinions about the health-care system, we must fight for them.</p>

<p>Did the Alberta Medical Association miss the memo? The Alberta health-care system is broke. That means expenses have to be reduced, not increased. So why is it that Alberta doctors will be receiving $518 per hour for seeing H1N1 patients? Isn't diagnosing and treating illness part of their basic job description? What is the estimated cost of this extra fee? And what happens if H1N1 turns into a real epidemic?How will the extra cost be paid then?</p>
<p>Since the reductions must be found within Alberta Health Services'budget, no doubt other health-care and administration employee numbers will be reduced and Albertans will see further delisting of services and longer wait times for procedures. Is that right?Why is it that the average Albertan always pays the price?Can this deal be scrapped?Who should Albertans contact to register their opinion on this travesty of justice?</p>

<p>Re: "No flu pay for nurses;Doctors could earn as much as$518 per hour in a public emergency," The Journal, Aug. 21, and "Docs' flu pay 'outrageous'; National nurses union condemns Alberta deal," Aug. 22.</p>
<p>Once again the "outrageous" pay that doctors make is splashed across the front pages of The Journal. Two days in a row no less!</p>
<p>I take issue with being accused of "stooping so low in case of a public crisis." Linda Silas, the president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses, has missed the point that was clearly stated by Dr. Noel Grisdale the head of the Alberta Medical Association.</p>
<p>Doctors are not negotiating "extra payments" behind the scenes or trying to take advantage of a public crisis, as implied by the "stunned" Silas. In fact, most physicians probably first heard about this through the news. Silas herself even states that this was not discussed at a national CMA meeting she attended.</p>
<p>I first heard about it after being up 36 hours straight when a nurse came cheerily up to me to tell me how I'm going to be "making thousands, but not the nurses." Doctors are not "under contract" and the vast majority of us are self-employed. We are also not unionized and we do not strike. The doctor's office you visit is paid for by the physician. And everything in it: the office nurse, the secretary, the office space and the supplies. Not by Alberta Health or anyone else. It is a fixed expense. So if we are called in to work in the hospital in the event of a swine flu crisis (which we will do without hesitation, despite the risks), who do you think pays for the office that is now empty?</p>
<p>This is a negotiated salary to pay physicians who have been pulled away from their offices where the overhead costs on average 30 to 40 per cent. So yes, $518 per hour (after hours only, mind you) is a big salary in absolute terms but of that, a physician will see $310 per hour for a graveyard shift and $156 per hour during daylight hours after they have paid for their offices. Let's put that into perspective. Most physicians have at least 12 years of post high school education. I am now on my 15th year with two more to go. Most physicians have accumulated huge debts to pay for their education (the average is well over $100,000 probably nearing $200,000). Yet Silas and most of the general public seem to feel that that is outrageous. I have had several people come up to me already saying how I'm going to be "making thousands." I know people on the oil rigs who make more money per hour than what has been negotiated for doctors and they certainly don't have the debt. I'm just curious how much Silas pays her hairdresser on an hourly basis. Let's not even mention lawyers or CEOs. And don't even consider professional sports players, with their multimillion-dollar contracts to play half a year. They certainly don't get as much front page attention as we do.</p>
<p>I certainly did not go into medicine for the money. As I approach my 40th birthday still carrying a huge student loan debt, I have a really hard time swallowing such naive comments as those of Silas. I applaud the AMA for trying to avert a public crisis and its continued efforts to deal with overwhelming overhead expenses that we, as self-employed physicians, face.</p>

</p>
<p>The fractured U.S. healthcare debate, replete with wild distortions of Canada's medicare, must seem incomprehensible to many north of our border.</p>
<p>News images of fabricated "death panels" or traumatized seniors on U.S. Medicare -- a government-funded program -- urging legislators to keep the government's hands "off my Medicare" must seem especially hard to fathom.</p>
<p>Equally puzzling, no doubt, has been the reaction of the administration and many of its allies in Congress whose response to the attacks is to move further away from comprehensive reform.</p>
<p>Entering the year with a Democratic president and strong majorities in both houses of Congress, and a clear public mandate to end our long health-care nightmare, President Barack Obama and Congressional leaders decided to compromise from the outset, and not pursue the most effective reform, Medicare for all.</p>
<p>Gambling they could bring along conservative opponents, the administration and Congressional leaders instead advanced a more limited plan that preserves the role of the insurance industry. Prospects of broader reform were further undermined by some liberal and progressive groups and labour unions, who chose to merely endorse the proposals of the administration and top Congressional Democrats, rather than fighting for a national system like single-payer, which many of them have long endorsed.</p>
<p>Overnight, the left flank was effectively gutted from the beginning of the fight. Most of the pressure has thus come from the right and those who embrace the status quo -- leading to further compromises by both Obama and the leading Democrats.</p>
<p>This retreat was clearly articulated by the former president, Bill Clinton, who chastised a conference of worried netroots activists Aug. 13, saying "I want us to be mindful we may need to take less than a full loaf."</p>
<p>But mobilizing activists for a half loaf has proven to be a challenge, as the White House and Congress have learned to their dismay in recent weeks as they struggle to counter those denouncing them from the right.</p>
<p>Even the grassroots network built by candidate Obama that set new standards for campaign activism last year has, the New York Times noted Aug. 15, failed to produce much enthusiasm for the current health plan, and most liberal constituency groups have not fared much better.</p>
<p>What's left is a proposal that will force the uninsured to buy private insurance with subsidies for low-income earners and only limited constraints on industry price gouging and care denials that characterize the collapsing insurance-based system.</p>
<p>In sum, it looks like another massive corporate bailout, following the earlier version for the banks, this time for an equally unpopular insurance industry, which will fuel even more public cynicism of the reform process and political system.</p>
<p>To residents of all other industrialized countries, terrors over a government role in promoting and protecting the health and safety of its citizenry, and the reluctance of political leaders to effectively respond to these attacks must be especially confounding. Among major nations, only in the U.S. is health care not a fundamental right, but bartered for profit by a maze of health-care corporations. The result is that the U.S. continues to fall far behind other industrial nations in a variety of measurements, from access to care to equality in treatment, and even in the much discussed issue of waiting times for medical care.</p>
<p>While the U.S. spends twice as much as every other nation on per capita health care, there remain more than 45 million Americans with no health coverage and tens of millions more with insurance who are routinely denied medical care because their insurer doesn't want to pay for it.</p>
<p>Medical bills account for 62 per cent of personal bankruptcies. Half of all Americans skip doctor visits or immunizations for their children because of high out-of-pocket costs, troubling news indeed with the U.S. already leading the globe in swine flu infections and deaths.</p>
<p>The nation's registered nurses and many doctors continue to press for real change, a national or single-payer system that would look familiar to Canadians and the rest of the industrial world. It is still possible to achieve stronger reform, but time is running out.</p>

</p>
<p>Struggling <span class="companylink">Japan Airlines Corp</span>., which is in the midst of major restructuring, is considering slashing 5,000 jobs in three years.</p>
<p>The planned job cuts would be equal to about 10 per cent of the company's workforce, Kyodo News Agency reported yesterday, citing unnamed industry sources.</p>
<p>Company officials could not be reached for comment. The number of workers at JAL, Asia's biggest airline group, stood at 48,930 at the end of April, according to the corporate website.</p>
<p>The money-losing airline hopes to cut the jobs through early retirements by March 2012, Kyodo said. The airline aims to unveil a massive restructuring program by the end of September.</p>
<p>Hit by plummeting demand in a slumping global economy and swine flu fears, JAL incurred its biggest-ever quarterly net loss of 99 billion yen ($1.1 billion) in the three months to June.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- Parents and health-care workers are reluctant to be immunized or vaccinate their children against a pandemic virus for fear that a drug would be brought to market with insufficient testing, a new Canadian study has found.</p>
<p>As governments worldwide place orders for the new H1N1 drug, the hesitancy to receive a vaccine shot presents a new hurdle for public health authorities as they attempt to contain the spread of the pandemic influenza virus.</p>
<p>The study, published yesterday in the Emerging Health Threats Journal, found that those surveyed believed they were at low risk of being infected, and, as a result, they were tentative about being vaccinated.</p>
<p>“Across the board, most people said they would need to know a lot more information about the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine, and a lot more about how risky the disease is before they would consider using it,” said Natalie Henrich, co-author of the paper and an assistant professor at the University of British Columbia. “People felt there was a lot they could do to protect themselves without needing a vaccine.”</p>
<p>Canada has ordered 50 million doses from <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which is contracted to produce pandemic flu vaccine for Canadians. And while most cases have been mild, there is no predicting the severity and timing of the pandemic strain's behaviour going into the fall. It could gain strength as early as next month with the aid of classrooms serving as incubators.</p>
<p>Prof. Henrich acknowledged that if the strain turns more virulent, more people will likely line-up for vaccinations.</p>
<p>The researchers conducted 11 focus groups in Vancouver before the onset of the current pandemic, and asked 85 participants how willing they would be to accept a new vaccine in the event of a pandemic. The groups consisted of health-care workers, parents, new immigrants and university students. The sample size may be small, but the responses given serve as an indication of the work officials have ahead of them in getting the public and health-care workers to receive vaccinations.</p>
<p>The public will need to be reassured that a vaccine is just as necessary as hand washing and other social distancing measures, Prof. Henrich said.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada stressed yesterday that it has strict rules before rolling out a vaccine.</p>
<p>“Public safety is paramount: we will strike the right balance between the need to have an H1N1 vaccine available quickly, and the imperative to ensure that vaccine is safe and effective,” the agency said in an e-mail.</p>

<p>As we head towards fall, signs of an economic spring are everywhere.</p>
<p>The "R" word in economic forecasting circles is now recovery, not recession, as optimists point to a raft of good news that includes:</p>
<p>- A resurgence in real estate activity in both the U.S. and Canada. The news here is particularly encouraging: Canadian housing sales in July were the best on record for the month and also marked a sixth consecutive month-over-month increase, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.</p>
<p>- Signs that Canadians are indulging in some strong retail therapy, with Statistics Canada reporting sales up in nine provinces in June. Saskatchewan's 2.3-per-cent increase in retail sales was second only to Manitoba's 2.8 per cent. New Brunswick was the only province posting a decline (0.2 per cent), but that followed a month (May) in which the province had posted the largest growth in sales nationally.</p>
<p>- Growing strength in the stock market: the TSE slumped to below 7,500 a few months ago, but is now above 10,700 and recently was briefly over 11,000.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Dow Jones index has calmed U.S. investors' nerves as it hits the 9,500 mark, well ahead of its 6,469 low point.</p>
<p>- Oil -- one of Saskatchewan's key exports -- has rebounded past $70 a barrel, more than double the $33 a barrel it fetched a few months ago.</p>
<p>Bank of Canada governor Mark Carney said in July that the recession was over, predicting "We are on track for the recovery both in Canada and globally."</p>
<p>And U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke also recently said the economy is on the verge of growing again. Banks and other financial experts have joined the chorus singing "happy days are here again".</p>
<p>Saskatchewan has relatively been unscathed by the recession. The most serious impact has been a slump in potash prices and sales that has left the provincial government short of $1.3 billion in</p>
<p>revenue.</p>
<p>In other provinces -- particularly Ontario -- thousands of jobs have been lost and one of the lingering effects of the recession all forecasters agree on is that there will still be high overall unemployment in Canada, the U.S. and other countries for several years even if the recovery continues uninterrupted.</p>
<p>Another legacy of the recession is the billions of dollars in stimulus packages governments have been forced to spend to keep economies moving. At some point, those debts must be paid and there are fears taxes might have to be increased as well as programs cut to balance budgets in future years.</p>
<p>If we're looking for a positive legacy to emerge from the meltdown, it would be a move away from the easy credit that got the world into a mess it won't soon forget.</p>
<p>And even as better times are forecast, there's a feeling that we're all from Missouri now: we'll believe in the recovery when it happens. Extreme caution is justified; if the H1N1 pandemic sickens millions this coming winter, the world could slump into a new recession.</p>

</p>
<p>Many small business owners prefer to avoid creating a contingency plan. But if you need motivation to address contingency planning, look no further than your family, your employees or your clients. Consider how they will be affected by an interruption or profound failure of your business.</p>
<p>Contingency planning simply looks at all the potential threats you may be exposed to and answers the question 'How would my business survive and thrive if... ?'</p>
<p>Planning for the unexpected means you have developed strategies to keep your business moving forward in the event of fire, theft, technology failure, liability claims or the death or disability of an owner, key employee or business partner. Identifying these risks and making appropriate provisions through insurance coverage, succession planning, or establishing processes are all part of creating effective contingency plans. It's really no different than preparing a will that takes care of your children, or having insurance in place.</p>
<p>There are many things outside of your control in business, but you can control how you respond when unplanned events occur. Consider the potential implications of threats such as the H1N1 pandemic. Do you have effective strategies and plans in place if you become ill or, worse, if several employees become ill? Are there key suppliers or service providers which your business relies on? Do you have contingency plans in place to mitigate interruptions to those services if they could no longer deliver due to a strike, for example?</p>
<p>Having a Plan B doesn't necessarily mean making provisions for disastrous circumstances. It could also be about making sure your business is prepared to handle a rapid growth strategy. Do you have a plan in place that would allow you to ramp up quickly to meet the exponential new demand for your product or service?</p>
<p>To unlock the growth potential of your business, be sure to include contingency planning as a key part of your management plan. The continuity of businesses over time -- often over generations -- and the livelihood they provide you and your employees bear testimony to the benefits of effective contingency planning. - David Wilton is director, small business, for Scotiabank.</p>

<p>Public health officials anticipate a surge in the number of cases of the H1N1 flu virus after schools reopen in September, but there are no plans for widespread school closures. Dr. Perry Kendall, B. C.'s chief provincial health officer, said yesterday that although the spread of the virus could potentially be curtailed by pre-emptive school closures, the social costs for parents and the workforce would be too great. "There would be a limited benefit for a lot of social disruption," Dr. Kendall said. "We do not recommend routine school closures." Prevention, education, and the immediate isolation of children who do get sick will be the focus, rather than keeping healthy children out of schools. "My guess is we'll see the virus amplify in September, with the number of cases going up in October," Dr. Kendall said.</p>

<p>The English Rugby Football Union decided to take no disciplinary action against suspected cases of fake-blood injuries, despite having evidence that the practice is widespread, and knowing the names of four Harlequins players who have colluded in such deception in recent seasons.</p>
<p>In a decision that will raise questions about rugby's commitment to rooting out cheating, the RFU said it would not hold a fresh investigation into the four previous occasions in which Harlequins faked blood injuries because it would "continue to attract comment and speculation, which might further damage reputations."</p>
<p>Harlequins former director of rugby Dean Richards was banned for three years after wing Tom Williams was instructed to fake a blood injury last season.</p>
<p>Players are allowed to be substituted if they are bleeding.</p>
<p>- False Imprisonment, Says Spur:</p>
<p>Tottenham Hotspur soccer player Jermain Defoe is to start legal action against Essex police for wrongful arrest and false imprisonment.</p>
<p>Defoe, 26, was stopped in his Range Rover and arrested on suspicion of driving while disqualified.</p>
<p>According to Defoe's lawyer, Nick Freeman, the Spurs striker was not disqualified from driving at the time of his arrest. He had previously been banned but this ban was not in effect at the time, as it was pending appeal.</p>
<p>Freeman said his client was suing the police as a matter of principle, and that should he win, any money would be donated to charity.</p>
<p>- Swine Flu Havoc in Japan:</p>
<p>The entire squad of Japan's Nippon Ham Fighters baseball team is being quarantined and tested for H1N1 influenza after three players contracted the virus.</p>
<p>Six sumo wrestlers and officials and a member of Japan's under-19 women's soccer team have also picked up the H1N1 flu over the past week.</p>
<p>Japan confirmed its third fatality from the disease on Wednesday in Nagoya. The country has confirmed over 5,000 cases of the flu.</p>

<p>Usual Suspects' first rule of journalism: There is no problem you can't make worse by laundering it in the media. Just ask Jim Balsillie and Eugene Melnyk. Or Dany Heatley and Patrick Kane. Years from now students of the fourth estate will look back at this past week and say, “This was not their finest hour.”</p>
<p>There was a time when discreet, private assassination was the preferred method of blackballing a sports rival such as Balsillie, the Research In Motion billionaire. But the subtler arts have given way to a more public process of story leaks, open letters and good-old intemperate media availabilities with reporters.</p>
<p>When NHL commissioner Gary Bettman declared that a queue-jumping Balsillie was not grovelling, er, dignified enough to own an NHL franchise (losing scads of money in Nashville or Phoenix being more dignified than making piles of dough in Hamilton), the battle for hockey hearts and minds went directly to the media and the blogosphere.</p>
<p>Despite the efforts of a U.S. bankruptcy judge (the felicitously named Redfield T. Baum) at a compromise in the Fight Of The Phoenix, neither side budged. Salvoes from both sides have continued to any reporter who could spell bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The melée culminated last week in an extraordinary public dis from Ottawa Senators owner Melnyk, who took umbrage with Balsillie intimating that he – along with several other NHL team owners who've had brushes with authorities – was hardly qualified to judge the RIM co-CEO's moral and ethical fitness as an owner. Claiming he'd been unable to reach Balsillie personally, Melnyk told a waiting world, “You should look around at the friends you are losing and the damage you are causing to yourself, the NHL and all Canadians.” All Canadians? Gee, we thought swine flu was dangerous …</p>
<p>With Balsillie – his king exposed, his Canadian rooks vanquished – down to his final moves in Phoenix, we may be spared further public amusements as Bettman delivers the Coyotes to his preferred suitor, Jerry Reinsdorf. And reporters spell-check the term Pyrrhic victory. But then, there's always Tampa. Or Atlanta. Or Florida.</p>
<p>Nothing To See Here</p>
<p>Dany Heatley and Patrick Kane both engaged in a little pre-emptive media spinning last week. To avoid distracting reporters from pressing Olympic issues – such as, “Is the Canadian jersey too boring?” or, “Why is Brian Burke's tie always undone?” – both star players fessed up (sort of) to the summertime blues.</p>
<p>In Kane's case, it was a 4 a.m. tussle that produced charges of misdemeanour assault and theft in connection with an alleged attack on a Buffalo taxi driver over a fare. In a burst of candour, the Chicago Blackhawks' young phenom told reporters at the U.S. Olympic orientation camp that he was embarrassed but had nothing more to say. Legal stuff, guys. Really, would love to say more but … whoa, gotta' go skate with Team USA.</p>
<p>Heatley, who can make the Sphinx seem chatty, was a little more forthcoming. The reason he didn't accept a trade to the Edmonton Oilers from the Ottawa Senators was nothing against Edmonton. It's just he wanted to explore options somewhere else. (Maybe where the airport isn't 100 miles from the city.) So, until other clubs had a chance to make a pitch for him and his $7.5-million (U.S.) annual salary-cap hit, he was going to sit tight. He might return to Ottawa. He might go to Edmonton. Or he might … whoa, gotta' go catch a plane to Calgary for the Canadian Olympic camp.</p>
<p>The real purpose of the non-disclosure disclosures was not to shed light on the issues but to allow both Kane and Heatley to tell pesky reporters, “Guys, I already addressed that in my press availability. Next question?” Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>Greener Pastures</p>
<p>Former NHL head coach Gary Green is stepping down from full-time hosting duties on XM Satellite Radio's NHL Home Ice this season. Saying he will continue with his NHL Network TV gig and some Home Ice appearances, Green tells Usual Suspects that his stadium-arena-architectural business (BBB Architects and its subsidiary group, Stadium Consultants International) demands more full-time attention.</p>
<p>“I really enjoyed doing the radio show, but the preparation didn't leave much time for the architectural work,” he says.</p>
<p>Green's firm is working on the “new” New York Rangers' Madison Square Garden, the New York Islanders' Nassau County Coliseum and a possible new Taylor Field in Regina. The firm also did Toronto's Air Canada Centre, BMO Field, and Vancouver's GM Place.</p>
<p>Joe Thistel, director of programming for Home Ice on XM, says Phil Esposito's duties will also be reworked. The Hall of Fame star will not be a host this season, but will have a “significant” presence on the satellite hockey network. “We're working out the details,” Thistel says.</p>

</p>
<p>Several Montreal schools got a taste of the disruptive effects of swine flu last spring.</p>
<p>The Akiva School had a few officially diagnosed cases of H1N1 in June. At the peak about 80 children were absent, said head of school Cooki Levy.</p>
<p>"Some really were sick. Some parents were just nervous that their child would get sick. And some were just the normal absentees that one would have anyway.</p>
<p>"But we definitely had a significantly increased absentee rate in the spring," Levy said of the private Jewish elementary school in Westmount.</p>
<p>School staff learned a few things from the experience, Levy said. "Generally we're very conscientious about communication in our school," she said. "But I think I recognized at some point that parents needed to hear from us almost daily."</p>
<p>At Parkdale Elementary School in St. Laurent, dozens of students were absent in early June. Réal Thibault, the chairperson of the school's governing board, said he learned of an H1N1 case at Parkdale, but not through official channels. Parents should be advised in such circumstances, contends Thibault, whose daughter got sick.</p>
<p>Akiva had strict guidelines that a student couldn't return to school until they had been fever-free for seven days, Levy said.</p>
<p>"We installed hand sanitizers in every classroom, near every doorway, every exit and entrance to the school. And we had a whole hand-washing campaign with the kids."</p>
<p>There was no outbreak among staff, which a parent who is a pediatrician chalked up to vigilance about hand-washing, Levy said.</p>
<p>Staff had to tread a fine line with students, she said.</p>
<p>"On the one hand, you want to teach them good habits and good hygiene and so on. On the other hand, we didn't want to scare them. So it was really the teachers talking about how disease spreads and what you do to prevent it."</p>

<p>Preventing H1N1 At School</p>
<p>Advice - Most Calgary school kids will be hitting the books next week.</p>
<p>With everyone in close quarters again for the year, colds and flus are bound to circulate.</p>
<p>The folks at Clorox, the bleach company, have come up with a few tips to help protect kids from the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>This advice could just as easily apply to other flus and colds, too, and to adults just the same.</p>
<p>Here's some of their advice for kids: - Cover your mouth and nose when you cough or sneeze. Cough or sneeze into your elbow or a tissue. Throw out the tissue and wash your hands afterward. - Avoid close contact with other kids who are sick or have symptoms. Avoid scheduling play dates and after-school activities with other children who are sick. - Teach kids to wash hands regularly with soap and water, especially after they cough or sneeze. (sing happy birthday or the ABC song while they wash to make sure they're cleaning their hands for enough time.) - Carry an alcohol-based hand cleaner and use it when a handwashing sink isn't immediately available. - Stay home when you're sick.</p>
<p>'Secret' Teacher Comes To Calgary</p>
<p>Event - The real stimulus package to help you survive this economic downturn is spirituality and optimism.</p>
<p>That's one message Michael Bernard beckwith, a teacher featured in the secret, will bring to Calgary oct. 21.</p>
<p>As founder of the Los angeles-based agape international spiritual centre, Bernard beckwith will talk about recovering from the recession using spiritual methods of "healing and transformation," a news release says.</p>
<p>He also promises to: - Move from coping to co-operating to communion through the power of creativity; - Develop your innate capacity to manifest your highest purpose, and; - Recognize the influence of your intention and thoughts upon your life.</p>
<p>The event starts at 7:30 p. m. and will be held at the Epcor Centre's Jack Singer Concert Hall. The event is hosted by the centre for positive living.</p>
<p>Tickets cost $69, $79, $99 or $169 for the VIP pass.</p>
<p>Each ticket includes a copy of Michael Nautilus's book Spiritual Liberation, Liberate your Spirit and Fulfil Your Soul's Potential.</p>

<p>Re: "Alberta braces for flu outbreak," Aug. 17.</p>
<p>Much has been written about H1N1, including Canada's preparedness. That is all laudatory, but I wonder why nothing is written about Latin America. It is winter there and the weather may be conducive to serious problems. Yet nothing appears in the papers. Does that mean there are few problems there? If so, why should Canadians be so concerned about it? Why ignore the situation? Or is it not comparable?</p>

</p>
<p>Re: Remember the lessons of the 1976 swine flu outbreak, Aug. 20.</p>
<p>Frank Kuschnereit is right in implying that no matter what we do in medicine there will always be a risk of an adverse event.</p>
<p>However, in his letter to the editor, he fails to mention that protecting against adverse outcomes and death from natural infection far outweighs the risk of an adverse vaccine event.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, these kinds of comments undermine public health efforts and continue to propagate falsehoods that quickly disseminate in the press. It is sexier to report on the horrible side-effects that are perceived to arise from vaccination campaigns than to report on the number of lives saved.</p>
<p>Vaccines have become victims of their own success. Few remember or were born when children where handicapped or condemned to an iron lung because of polio or that children died of encephalitis as a complication of measles or suffered neurological complications from meningitis.</p>
<p>The influenza vaccine has received considerable bad press as a result of the 1976 vaccination campaign. Fear is exacerbated by inaccurate facts -- including many original findings that have since been debunked.</p>
<p>For those interested in factual data, refer to a recent publication in the Journal of Infectious Diseases (JID, 2009, 200:321) which reviews influenza vaccines and their association with Guillain-Barré Syndrome.</p>
<p>The 1976 swine flu vaccination campaign is perceived as a failure only because, unlike the H1N1 virus, the 1976 swine flu virus never transitioned into the community. If it had, the death toll would have been the same as or worse than seasonal flu which in Canada claims at least 5,000 lives every year, a mortality rate higher than the worst swine flu vaccine adverse event rate.</p>
<p>If such had been the case, the campaign would instead have been hailed as a resounding success.</p>
<p>We need governments to spend more than the $400 million that is already being spent on further influenza vaccine research and development -- and to expand funding for pandemic preparedness, surveillance, public health intervention, communication, diagnostics and therapeutics.</p>

<p>Canada's pork industry has been thrown a lifeline ... hasn't it?</p>
<p>That's what you had to wonder when you measured the responses to the new $75-million federal program designed to set the pork sector on a new course, through increased marketing and fewer producers and hogs.</p>
<p>As the Canadian Pork Council explains it, the three-part program will provide loans to farmers "that still have an opportunity to survive," help those who need to leave the business through an orderly transition program, and - for those who remain-help create more demand for Canadian hog and pork products with Canada's international trading partners.</p>
<p>Some liked it. Two days after the announcement, Ottawa issued a news release drawing the media's attention to favourable responses from the council, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture and the Keystone Agricultural Producers in Manitoba.</p>
<p>"As the transition plan is implemented, a leaner, greener and more innovative industry will emerge - one that is prepared to capitalize on both domestic and international opportunities," the council forecast.</p>
<p>It made no mention of the $800 million it had earlier asked Ottawa for to save the industry. The federal government rejected that request because it was feared the Americans would call it an unfair subsidy and retaliate with a stiff border tariff or something equally punitive.</p>
<p>For its part, the Canadian Federation of Agriculture said the help was appreciated. "The pork sector's impact on the economy is significant and Canada cannot afford to risk losing this vital industry," the federation said. However, it and the Keystone group warned the industry remained in dire straits and far from recovery.</p>
<p>And not everyone is pleased with the program, for different reasons.</p>
<p>Some farmers are opposed to its very foundation - that is, transitioning farmers out of the hog business. They're not convinced there are too many hogs and too many hog farmers. They say that's just a part of the problem, citing high feed prices and a bad public image caused by H1N1 flu as well.</p>
<p>Still others questioned the program's financial commitment.</p>
<p>"The Canadian industry is currently losing $30 million a week. The situation is deteriorating daily," wrote industry observer Jim Long, in his weekly Pork Commentary e-newsletter. "The industry is in crisis ... (Ottawa) has been working on this for months. It's too little too late."</p>
<p>Back in Guelph, the George Morris Centre issued a report on the situation, saying the assistance package "does not account for policy failures that will only sow the seeds of future challenges and additional requests for support." The centre believes policies for the red meat sector are not well co-ordinated with those for biofuel, or trade management with the U.S.</p>
<p>Al Mussell, senior research associate and co-author of the report said the sector's woes are mainly due to "segmented Canadian policies that are at odds with one another, and which fail to grasp the significance of hog production and pork processing in the broader Canadian economy."</p>
<p>He thinks it's crazy to subsidize both biofuel development and hog production, because the two compete for same basic feedstocks.</p>
<p>I see his point.</p>
<p>But the government was long criticized for doing nothing. And now, at least it's done something to try to help. I, too, don't think transitioning people out of farming is the answer, but I also don't think Ottawa could continue dragging its feet and letting the sector plummet further.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Stronger oversight for public health</b>
</div><div>669 words</div><div>24 August 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada has endured the ravages of SARS and the havoc wreaked by a listeriosis outbreak in recent years. Both episodes exposed the glaring shortcomings in our public health protection systems, notably the inability of federal and provincial authorities to seamlessly share information and resources - and act decisively.</p>
<p>Now, with many worried about the spectre of a future Swine flu pandemic, it's worth asking if we have learned any of the painful lessons of the past. The evidence suggests we are lagging.</p>
<p>At root, Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, lacks the autonomy and clout he needs to fulfil his mission to protect the lives of Canadians. Indeed, there's a very real risk that Canada's public health watchdog won't be able to provide a full measure of protection from pandemics and other threats.</p>
<p>Last week, the Canadian Medical Association Journal catalogued some of those gaps, arguing for a "health care czar" to deal with any H1N1 flu pandemic down the road.</p>
<p>Such a czar would go too far; it's not a good fit in Canada's complex constitutional setting. But the journal was correct in highlighting a public health gap that must be addressed.</p>
<p>The system's weakness was painfully apparent in last summer's bungled listeriosis crisis. Local public health agencies, provincial health ministries and federal health and agriculture officials were all involved in handling that outbreak, but no one assumed full responsibility.</p>
<p>Twenty-two people died. Some might well have been saved if a stronger federal health authority had produced a faster, more coherent response.</p>
<p>Failure to adequately monitor and disclose the deadly spread of SARS prompted the World Health Organization to warn against travelling to Canada in 2003. The Public Health Agency of Canada was established in the wake of that blunder to speak with an independent voice on health matters and take the lead in times of crisis.</p>
<p>But, fully six years after the SARS outbreak, this agency still depends on provinces and municipalities to provide data on an outbreak. Auditor General Sheila Fraser last year concluded that Canada's national public health agency remained dependent on the goodwill of provinces and territories and, as a result, was "not assured of receiving timely, accurate and complete information."</p>
<p>Yet today, long after the auditor general highlighted the problem, Ottawa still lacks a signed agreement with the provinces on sharing potentially life-saving public health information.</p>
<p>It wasn't supposed to be this way. The national public health agency was originally envisioned as a broad, independent shield offering protection to all Canadians without political interference.</p>
<p>It has fallen short of that ideal. Rather than being free of the political process, Butler-Jones, the country's first chief public health officer, is classed as a deputy minister serving the Minister of Health.</p>
<p>Ostensibly, he has freedom to speak publicly on health matters and report on issues of concern. But it would be naive to expect Butler-Jones, or any future public health chief, to be oblivious to political pressure.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, the Canadian Medical Association Journal called for a health care czar to handle the response to H1N1, with "executive powers across all jurisdictions," including authority to transfer health care equipment, and personnel, from one part of the country to another.</p>
<p>But with responsibility for delivering health care falling under provincial jurisdiction, such a shift in responsibility disregards the country's constitutional realities. Moreover, up until this point, the impact of the pandemic has been relatively mild. While it has taken more than 65 Canadian lives, even an average flu season can kill well over 4,000.</p>
<p>Rather than rushing ahead in a panic over H1N1, and turning to a czar, Ottawa would better protect Canadians by taking measured and careful steps toward boosting the power and autonomy of its chief public health officer.</p>
<p>And improving the mechanisms for federal-provincial co-operation - and decision-making - in times of crisis.</p>

</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>

</p>
<p>The federal government is not giving any guarantees that Amos Okemow School in Gods River will be open by the time 300 students want to return to class on Sept. 8.</p>
<p>The school has been closed for repairs since the fire commissioner ordered it shut down last month. Indian and Northern Affairs Canada will only say that the school will open as soon as possible. Federal staff met with Manto Sipi Cree Nation officials last week, a spokeswoman for the department said.</p>
<p>"The advance of the school's annual maintenance funds will help address the electrical repairs cited by the chief. An assessment of the electrical and other costs is being done by an outside firm and will help determine if additional measures are necessary," the INAC official said.</p>
<p>"INAC officials met with representatives of Manto Sipi and committed an additional $35,000 for water and sewer repairs for the school and its portable classrooms. As well, the department agreed to ahead of schedule to accommodate other repairs," she said.</p>
<p>Chief Oliver Okemow said the school needs $75,000 in electrical repairs, which will take two weeks to carry out.</p>
<p>"It was brought to their attention in May. They've had all summer to rectify it," Okemow said. "It would only take a couple of weeks."</p>
<p>Okemow said the fire commissioner will not allow the kindergarten to Grade 11 Amos Okemow Memorial School to reopen until repairs are made.</p>
<p>"We have to look at the electrical, and at the sprinkler system -- there's one there, but it's not working," said Okemow, who said the school also needs a new fire alarm system.</p>
<p>There is nowhere else to hold classes, the chief added. "The buildings (in the community) we identified have no running water. With H1N1 coming, that's not advisable," he said.</p>
<p>Thompson is about 125 kilometres to the northwest, but there's no road, he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>AFTER-SOVIET CLEANUP - Winnipeg firm building lab to contain warfare bugs</b>
</div><div>By Bartley Kives </div>
<div>1427 words</div><div>23 August 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>Anthrax initially gives you flu-like symptoms if you inhale it. After several days, you lose the ability to breathe and likely die.</p>
<p>Hemorrhagic fevers start off with head or stomach aches before you bleed from the nose or gums and bruise all over. If you don't seek treatment, the dehydration will finish you off.</p>
<p>Brucellosis will make you sweat profusely and cause severe joint and muscle pain. It probably won't kill you -- but you'll keep the nasty affliction for life.</p>
<p>All of these diseases are naturally present in the former Soviet republic of Kyrgyzstan, a mountainous nation sandwiched between China and Kazakhstan. Varieties of these bugs were turned into biological weapons by Soviet scientists.</p>
<p>Now, a group of Winnipeg architects and engineers is working to keep people in Kyrgyzstan safe from these horrific diseases -- and prevent terrorists and rogue states from acquiring and deploying them as weapons of mass destruction.</p>
<p>Smith Carter Architects and Engineers are putting the finishing touches on the design for a Level III biological containment laboratory slated to be built in Bishkek, the Kyrgyz capital, with the help of $30 million in Canadian funds.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg firm quietly went to work on the $3.6-million design job last year after winning an open government bid, largely because of its experience as a designer or consultant on more than a dozen biological containment labs around the globe.</p>
<p>The Kyrgyz containment lab is modelled loosely on the Level IV Canadian Science Centre for Human and Animal Health on Arlington Street. The Winnipeg facility, completed in 1997, was among the first in the world to combine labs for both human and animal pathogens -- a move that proved to be prescient, considering the rising threat of diseases that can pass from livestock, primates and other animals to people, such as avian flus, tropical fevers and flus like H1N1.</p>
<p>Canada's interest in relatively obscure Kyrgyzstan, a landlocked central Asian nation of about 5.4 million people, stems almost entirely from global security concerns.</p>
<p>Existing labs in Kyrgyzstan are neither safe for the scientists who work there or secure enough to prevent dangerous pathogens from falling into the wrong hands, said Trevor Smith, the federal official in charge of Canada's efforts to help reduce the spread of biological and chemical weapons around the world.</p>
<p>Employing former Soviet weapons scientists in state-of-the-art facilities aids the non-proliferation cause, added Smith, noting the wages for Kyrgyz scientists -- as little as $20 a month -- make them targets for unscrupulous people with deep pockets.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to make sure people who are in possession of Soviet-era weapons knowledge are not inclined to share that knowledge with terrorists or rogue states that may proliferate the technologies," Smith said in a telephone interview from Ottawa.</p>
<p>Central Asian nations are a special problem, given the presence of both deadly pathogens and scientists who know how to turn those bugs into weapons in countries such as Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, he said.</p>
<p>Soviet scientists led the world in biological weapons research, largely because the U.S.S.R. ignored a landmark 1972 treaty that led the U.S. and other western nations to dismantle their weapons programs and destroy stockpiles of biological agents.</p>
<p>As former Soviet weapons engineer Ken Alibek, an ethnic Kazakh, writes in his 1999 memoir-cum-expose Biohazard, Russian biological warfare experts were horrified to learn at the end of the Cold War that they and they alone ignored the 1972 non-proliferation treaty while their American counterparts stopped conducting bio-weapons research.</p>
<p>Although it's relatively easy to reproduce a few anthrax spores in a laboratory or a grow a petri dish full of tularemia, turning horrible diseases into weapons is a lot more complex, Alibek writes.</p>
<p>Many deadly diseases are not very infectious, requiring scientists to explore ways of infusing them with genetic material from more virulent but less deadly diseases. Other candidates for biological weapons are not hardy enough to withstand exposure to the air or extreme temperatures.</p>
<p>There are also technical considerations that go into the "dispersion technology" required to create a biological weapon. Anthrax, for instance, which is rarely transmitted from one person to another, must be turned into an aerosol with very specific properties in order to become effective as a weapon of mass destruction.</p>
<p>If the aerosol is too fine, people will breathe it in and out without getting infected. If the particles are too large, the spores will fall on the ground without making anyone sick. Turning anthrax into a weapon requires a highly specialized skill set -- a knowledge base that still exists in the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Eliminating all stockpiles of deadly pathogens is not an option in countries like Kyrgyzstan, which needs to store samples of anthrax, brucellosis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever and cholera to conduct tests in the event of a natural outbreak, Smith said.</p>
<p>"We can't just go into the Kyrgyz Republic and tell them we're going to destroy all the anthrax like we do with the sarin and soman and VX," he said, referring to chemical weapons.</p>
<p>The response is the Level III containment lab planned for Bishkek, which will replace existing facilities that have broken locks, insufficient fencing, windows without bars and horribly inadequate means of protecting the scientists who work with deadly pathogens, Smith said.</p>
<p>All biological containment labs must protect their workers, resist intrusion and attack and employ a series of redundant processes to help prevent pathogens from escaping to the outside world, said Scott Stirton, Smith Carter's chief executive officer.</p>
<p>All biological containment labs employ similar means of filtering air, cleaning liquid effluent and separating technicians from the pathogens they handle, Stirton said.</p>
<p>But security measures are not the same everywhere in the world. The Arlington Street lab in Winnipeg, for example, was designed to prevent vehicles from launching an Oklahoma City-style truck-bomb attack and has bullet-resistant windows, among other security features.</p>
<p>A lab in Kyrgyzstan, where public utilities are not as well developed as they are in Canada, also must be able to operate during a power blackout or water shortage, Stirton said. The Bishkek facility will also be impervious to bombs and will even be able to keep operating in the event one part of the facility is damaged or destroyed by a catastrophic attack, he said.</p>
<p>Smith Carter, which has helped build containment labs in Canada, the U.S., Mexico, the U.K., Kenya, India and Singapore, does not have a single template for its facilities. An international panel of containment experts helps the firm avoid a cookie-cutter approach when it designs a lab, Stirton said.</p>
<p>"Our team has to be sensitive to the needs and resources in Kyrgyzstan and not just impose a North American approach," he said, adding the building design takes into account the availability of construction materials in Central Asia and the ability for local contractors to conduct the work.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Canada was a world leader in biological containment, as other western countries mistakenly believed the fight against emerging diseases had already been won, Stirton said.</p>
<p>But the Sept. 11 attack in 2001 and the subsequent anthrax scare changed attitudes in the United States, which has been aggressively building new facilities - and, like Canada, spending money on non-proliferation measures around the world.</p>
<p>The $30 million earmarked for the Level III lab in Kyrgyzstan is part of a larger $1-billion Canadian effort to restrict the spread of biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and technologies over 10 years.</p>
<p>At the Trieste, Italy G8 conference in June, Canada announced $180 million in new non-proliferation projects, including millions for security upgrades at Russian nuclear facilities, employment programs for former weapons scientists and dismantling nuclear submarines, along with the well-underway Bishkek laboratory design.</p>
<p>"Kyrgyzstan is in a very dangerous part of the world. It's very close to Afghanistan. For lack of a better word, it's a really tough neighbourhood and there is cause for concern the dangerous materials they have are not as secure as they need to be," says Smith in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Winnipeg's Smith Carter, meanwhile, is ecstatic to be involved in a project that helps make the planet a little bit more secure.</p>
<p>"Our profession has always had altruistic values," CEO Stirton said. "This is one project where we believe we can make a difference."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Suicide an epidemic among First Nations</b>
</div><div>Doug Cuthand </div>

</p>
<p>Prime Minister Stephen Harper visited the Arctic last week. The weekend preceding his visit, a photo was taken of two 10-year-old boys sleeping outside an Iqaluit supermarket. It was 6:30 a.m. and one of the boys was wearing shorts.</p>
<p>The photo was carried across the country and brought to light the extent of social problems in Canada's North. However, before we conclude that this is an issue for Nunavut, we should take a long, hard look in our own backyards.</p>
<p>Aboriginal communities across Canada, but more so in remote areas, face serious social problems. High unemployment, alcohol and substance abuse coupled with poor living conditions have created a society in crisis.</p>
<p>And of course we have the lingering effects of the residential schools, which still cast a long shadow across Indian country.</p>
<p>The heaviest burden falls on the young, as evidenced by the high rate of youth suicide. Our young people are committing suicide at a rate that's anywhere from five to six times that of the general population. One-third of all deaths of aboriginal youth aged 10 to 19 are attributable to suicide.</p>
<p>The rates vary regionally, but in all cases we have an epidemic on our hands. The suicide rate for Inuit youth is the highest in the world, at 11 times the national average.</p>
<p>This is a problem that our leaders would rather avoid. It's not upbeat and it's not based on land claims or treaty rights. It's a social problem that has a wide variety of roots and causes. It is not a simple problem with a quick fix.</p>
<p>Harper's response, while in the Arctic, was to focus on economic development programs. He thinks the crisis could be solved with the help of an economic development office.</p>
<p>To a certain extent he is right, although it's simplistic and naive thinking. The North needs economic development, but it can't be viewed in isolation. There is much more to it. In fact, I have known hard-working and self-sufficient people who lost a child to suicide. The reasons are deeply embedded in our society.</p>
<p>We are living in a period of rapid social change, and not always for the better. Young native people today are not speaking their mother language, so many of the old stories and teachings are not available to them. The outside culture has been introduced through television and our people are on the outside looking in.</p>
<p>The worlds of Toronto, New York and California are far different from the one they inhabit. They are shown a world they may never join, but they look at their own world and perceive only emptiness.</p>
<p>Today, it's very hard to grow up as an aboriginal person. Young people face a world that is far different from that of their parents and grandparents. It is a world of diminishing opportunities, with pressure to succeed. It's also one dislocated from aboriginal language and culture, especially for urban youth.</p>
<p>Alienated young people are often depressed and vulnerable to addictions. Many self-medicate by turning to alcohol and drugs. Small issues become magnified. For example, a breakup with a girlfriend or boyfriend is a leading cause for suicide.</p>
<p>Young people who are already at risk find themselves overwhelmed by problems that all youth face at some time in their lives. Some can handle them, while others fall into depression and opt for suicide.</p>
<p>Economic development sounds like a quick fix. It appeals to the elites in Indian country. Development money goes to those in business, with the hope they will hire aboriginal people. Other programs such as suicide prevention, family counselling and youth counselling services are regarded as pedestrian and get overlooked.</p>
<p>In fact, suicide prevention is a complicated issue. Its roots are in the families, communities and society as a whole. The effect of suicide on the families is devastating. Parents are racked with guilt and pain, friends suffer the loss and over the course of the year teachers deal with the loss of several students.</p>
<p>Some communities have experienced the loss of one community member on average each month. This constant mourning can drive a whole community into shock and depression.</p>
<p>But when one considers that suicide is the cause of death for one-third of our young people, it can't be ignored. If suicide were a disease, it would be considered an epidemic in our community and medical resources would be brought in.</p>
<p>At the moment there is a lot of concern about the H1N1 virus and the threat it poses to aboriginal communities. Health professionals are warning that the flu could harm the aboriginal population, chiefly because of poor living conditions and overcrowding.</p>
<p>The outbreak will have passed in a few months, but suicide will continue to be the epidemic that most threatens Canada's aboriginal people.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cattle, hog inventories down, Statistics Canada says</b>
</div><div>Neil Scott </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network</div>
<div>500 words</div><div>22 August 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix </div>
</p>
<p>More troubling news for the beleaguered livestock industry came Friday from Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>A report showed that inventories of cattle and hogs were down nationally, including in Saskatchewan. The report compared numbers from July 1, 2008, with July of this year.</p>
<p>Low livestock prices are blamed on the high value of the Canadian dollar, drought, high feed costs, the international recession and problems getting exports into the U.S.</p>
<p>The drop of approximately 15,000 cattle in Saskatchewan -- the numbers changed to 3.370 million from 3.385 million -- was modest compared to the decline in the hog herd.</p>
<p>There were 810,000 hogs in Saskatchewan this July, which was down by 161,000 from a year earlier.</p>
<p>"Our industry is on the verge of collapse. We're in a desperate situation,'' said Joe Kleinsasser, chair of Sask Pork.</p>
<p>"I anticipate we're going to drop even more. I wish I had a solution,'' Kleinsasser added.</p>
<p>A major restructuring of the industry is needed, which would include less reliance on exports to the U.S., where the recession, concerns about H1N1, the high Canadian dollar and the country of origin labelling program have had their effects, Kleinsasser said.</p>
<p>While Kleinsasser is hoping the pork industry can start to rebound by early next year, he said the short-term isn't good as a restructuring process continues.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud said the numbers released Friday were "kind of surprising,'' because they weren't quite as bad as anticipated.</p>
<p>The drop in the province's cattle herd was fairly modest, Bjornerud noted.</p>
<p>"That's a good sign'' that could indicate the industry might start recovering, Bjornerud said.</p>
<p>While conceding that many Saskatchewan producers are experiencing continuing tough times, he said the province's industry "is situated in a good position'' to be more prosperous once the problems are solved.</p>
<p>Jack Hextall, president of the Saskatchewan Cattlemen's Association, said he anticipates the tough times for the province's beef industry will continue for the immediate future.</p>
<p>"It's going to take time to fix this,'' Hextall said. "It's tough slugging."</p>
<p>But a declining supply of beef cattle, combined with increased demand for product as the recession recedes, should eventually push prices for beef and livestock upward, Hextall said,</p>
<p>"In the long term, there's a brighter outlook,'' he said.</p>
<p>The data released Friday indicated the sheep herd in Saskatchewan had declined to 114,000 head in July this year from 125,000 a year earlier.</p>
<p>Across Canada, the number of cattle was 14.8 million head, down from 15.2 million a year earlier. There were 12.1 million hogs across the country in July, down from 12.9 million a year earlier. The number of sheep was unchanged at 1.06 million.</p>

<p>The City of Saskatoon says it's prepared for the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic, if it comes this fall.</p>
<p>The city is arming employees with "education, policy, and procedure," to make sure city work continues and employees are prepared in the case of a flu outbreak, said Ray Unrau, the city's emergency measures co-ordinator.</p>
<p>Previously known as swine flu, H1N1 has been linked to 66 deaths in this country, and more than 1,800 worldwide, according to the latest numbers.</p>
<p>Any skeptics of the seriousness of H1N1 need only look to New Zealand, Unrau said, where those sick from the virus have overwhelmed hospital intensive-care units.</p>
<p>There are a long list of policies in place for city employees, the most obscure of which is a "social distancing" policy, where city employees are encouraged to stand six-feet apart when talking to avoid spreading the virus.</p>
<p>"Employees have to know that it's not acceptable to share pencils or be a close talker," Unrau said.</p>
<p>The city isn't taking the extreme measures a few U.S. cities have implemented, where sick employees are quarantined at work.</p>
<p>"The best defence is not creating a bubble around all our employees," he said.</p>

<p>A price tag of $50,000 was approved by city council Monday for the Saskatoon stage of the Olympic torch relay on Jan. 11, 2010.</p>
<p>The money will pay for the torch relay party in Kiwanis Park, including providing heated tents, portable toilets, and, of course, entertainment.</p>
<p>The city won't, however, be following International Olympic Committee guidelines, which apparently don't allow people to distribute political materials during the relay, said city manager Murray Totland.</p>
<p>The B.C. civil liberties association wrote to council expressing their concern with the policy as an affront to freedom of expression.</p>
<p>"We have no intention of enforcing that criteria," Totland said.</p>

<p>Another wave of walkway wars that pit neighbour versus neighbour is set to begin in the city.</p>
<p>A sneak preview took place at the city's planning and operations committee this week, where residents of Crimp Place in Fairhaven argued the walkway connection to Fairmont Drive, shared with Sask. Housing-owned apartment complexes, should be closed.</p>
<p>Adjacent homeowner Quinton Matzner told the committee that vandalism, litter, needles, noise and drug activity have spurred the Crimp Place residents to fight a six-year battle to close what he said was an underused and dangerous walkway.</p>
<p>Fairmont Drive resident Mark Kleiner, on the other hand, argued the walkway was the only safe passage for neighbourhood kids and joggers to get to the nearby park because of the traffic problems on busy Clancy Drive, the closest through street.</p>
<p>He said closing the walkway would be "a travesty for our children." Kleiner was joined by Jocelyn Selinger and her young son, who said that if the walkway was closed her kids would "lose their freedom."</p>
<p>Those arguments were countered by Crimp Place resident Shannon Berikoff, who held her three-year-old son Gabriel in her arms throughout the meeting. She said she often worries about young children playing in the catwalk with no shoes or supervision despite the presence of needles.</p>
<p>"I want this to be a safe place for my child to play," she said.</p>
<p>Since the meeting, Berikoff reports the residents are working together to come up with a solution that doesn't pit "us against them."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>A "very minor" concern prompted Brevoort Park resident Scott Epp to write city council about some curious graffiti on his street sign.</p>
<p>Someone painted over the "T" in Tucker Crescent, turning it into an "F."</p>
<p>"I wonder what people would think if they knew we lived on a street called that," he wrote.</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>Does not voting count as a "yes" vote or a "no" vote?</p>
<p>That was the question councillors debated during discussion of a change to the way tenants vote if a landlord wants to convert their apartment building to condominiums.</p>
<p>Then, Coun. Glen Penner made a point to his fellow councillors Monday night, given the low voter turnout in municipal elections of late.</p>
<p>If not casting a ballot is counted as a no, Penner said, "none of us would be elected in October."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The 39-day strike, explained sort of; The city admits it was ready to make concessions on pay and sick bank months ago. So why didn't it?</b>
</div><div>Sandro Contenta </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>1849 words</div><div>22 August 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>MET</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>It is the first day of David Miller's summer vacation. The mayor is sitting on the patio of a cafe in the Junction neighbourhood, sipping coffee in a pink Toronto FC jersey. The stress of a 39-day city workers' strike begins to lift.</p>
<p>"Good luck to you," shouts a woman from the sidewalk. "I know it's not easy."</p>
<p>"It's okay," Miller replies. "Thank you very much."</p>
<p>"That's funny," he tells the Star. "I get this sort of stuff everywhere."</p>
<p>Later, a pickup truck rolls by. The driver honks and gives the mayor a thumbs up.</p>
<p>"You can see how angry people are," Miller jokes. "You know when Torontonians are upset: They don't look at you - they look down when you walk by. They certainly don't give you the thumbs up."</p>
<p>Two people don't make a public opinion poll, of course. But like green shoots in recessionary times, Miller is happy for any sign that public anger might be waning, now that city workers are back on the job after the 39-day strike that ended late last month.</p>
<p>"Everybody involved got blamed by the public - and we should have," he says when asked about his popularity plunging during the strike. "People were justly frustrated, as I was. If you had polled me about the strike I probably would have said the same thing."</p>
<p>The frustration was warranted. Three weeks after the end of the bitter strike, key players involved say it should never have happened.</p>
<p>The mayor is questioning his own strategy, and Ann Dembinski, president of one of the two striking unions, is furious about the sick plan compromise that made the contract settlement possible.</p>
<p>They reveal a deal blocked for months by venomous labour relations, entrenched positions and miscalculations. The outcome suggests there will not be labour peace any time soon.</p>
<p>"They've sent labour relations back decades," says Dembinski, president of the city's inside workers in CUPE local 79. "It was the nastiest round of bargaining I've ever been in - by far."</p>
<p>Miller, as pro-union a mayor city hall has ever had, insists he achieved his bottom line - limited wage increases and an eventual end to a bank of unused sick days that is a $140 million liability for the city. He maintains he did it despite conservative councillors bent on sabotaging his every move.</p>
<p>But he failed at his preferred objective, the one his negotiators clung to during seven months of bargaining: an immediate end to the sick bank. Instead, it will be phased out.</p>
<p>In hindsight, Miller says the city could have been more flexible on both wages and the sick bank.</p>
<p>"Could we have given our bargainers flexibility beforehand? Maybe. Those are things we could have done differently.</p>
<p>"If I had to do it over would I try to do that? Well, given what I know now, yes, possibly," Miller says, quickly adding that in any event, union demands were too high to avoid a strike.</p>
<p>Miller had targeted the unions' sick bank, which lets employees accumulate up to 18 sick days a year and cash them out at half their value on retirement. The maximum payout, for those with at least 25 years of service, is six months' salary. The unions vowed a fight to the finish.</p>
<p>The compromise gives current employees the option to bank unused sick days, or cash them out and join a new, short-term disability program. New hires don't get the sick bank option; they will be covered by the short-term disability plan.</p>
<p>This "grandfathering" model has been used in some municipalities for almost 30 years. Mississauga, Oshawa and Etobicoke, before amalgamation, struck similar deals - all without a strike.</p>
<p>Why was Toronto different? Why did daycares have to close and mounds of garbage rot in city parks for the city to reach a deal other municipalities obtained without a walkout?</p>
<p>It is all the more baffling because a phase-out plan, according to Miller, was part of the mandate council's employee labour relations committee gave negotiators as far back as last September. Yet he says they never proposed it in bargaining, waiting instead until sometime after July 15 - at least 24 days into the strike - for mediators to raise the option.</p>
<p>Negotiations began in January with locals 79 and 416 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees, which together represent 30,000 inside and outside workers, including garbage collectors. It was the kind of atmosphere where one side said good morning and the other wondered what was really meant.</p>
<p>The tension began in 1998, when the provincial government merged seven municipalities into one - the current city of Toronto. The shotgun wedding resulted in the compression of 52 collective agreements into six.</p>
<p>The city and unions have since been trying to iron out conflicting job descriptions, working conditions and seniority rights. Some solutions - including those that ended a 2002 strike by city workers - were imposed by arbitrators.</p>
<p>The latest negotiations began with both sides far apart. The city flatly rejected union demands for wage-increase parity with police and firefighters - 3 per cent in each of three years. Unions in turn insisted on keeping their sick banks. Local 79 refused to even discuss that matter.</p>
<p>"Our bargaining team said absolutely not - we don't want to hear anything on an alternative sick time plan," Dembinski says. By June, local 79 and the city weren't talking.</p>
<p>Outside workers in local 416 had plenty to discuss. President Mark Ferguson says the city wanted changes to contract language on working conditions, grievance procedures, seniority and the process for layoffs.</p>
<p>"I had never come across such a draconian set of proposals during my 10 years as a trade unionist," says Ferguson, 40, relaxing in the backyard of his modest Aurora bungalow.</p>
<p>The city tried to divide and conquer, he believes, by sparing local 79 similar demands.</p>
<p>Ferguson says that by June 21, after six months of bargaining and with a midnight strike deadline looming, no more than 20 minutes had been spent discussing the city's bid to replace the sick bank.</p>
<p>Less than three hours before deadline, Bruce Anderson, the city's chief negotiator, tabled a proposal to buy out the sick days workers had banked. The city offered "pennies to the dollar," Ferguson says. Besides, so many "concessions" remained on the table that a strike by then was inevitable, he adds.</p>
<p>"If in fact the city had given us some sort of signal that they were interested in the sick bank and the sick bank alone, then a deal could have been achieved much sooner," he says.</p>
<p>"The city is immobilized," he charges. "It's such a large organization that they have real difficulty in turning around proposals in a reasonable amount of time."</p>
<p>If grandfathering of the sick bank was part of the city's negotiating mandate, why wasn't it offered before the strike deadline? Why didn't the city offer it at all?</p>
<p>"You'd better be ready to be fired as a negotiator if you have that in your arsenal and you don't deploy it to avoid a strike," says a national labour expert, who asked to remain anonymous.</p>
<p>Anderson says the city's preferred option was to eliminate the sick bank altogether. He argues it would have been bad strategy to improve the offer while unions were rejecting existing proposals and refusing to move an inch. Besides, both sides were still far apart on other matters.</p>
<p>"I can categorically tell you that we would have not had a deal had we discussed (grandfathering) three months prior," says Anderson, the city's head of human resources.</p>
<p>Councillor Doug Holyday, former mayor of Etobicoke, confirms that the option of phasing out the sick bank was discussed months earlier at council's labour relations committee. But he says Anderson thought it would be too complex to administer.</p>
<p>The city also believed the union would let the strike deadline pass without a walkout.</p>
<p>"I expected them to keep negotiating and reach an agreement," Miller says.</p>
<p>Miller says most of the non-monetary issues were resolved by early July. On the 8th, council's labour relations committee agreed to sweeten the wage offer and give city negotiators more flexibility to strike a deal - something Miller now says he might have done sooner.</p>
<p>In an unusual move that incensed the unions, Miller made the offer public a day after presenting it to them. He telephoned to warn union leaders minutes before doing so.</p>
<p>The offer was a 7 per cent pay hike over four years. Miller says city negotiators knew they could eventually settle for 6 per cent over three years, which in the end they did. He also unveiled a website that let workers calculate how much they would receive by selling their banked sick days. For most, the buyouts ranged from $500 to $8,500.</p>
<p>Miller says his office was then swamped with calls from strikers eager to cross the picket line. About 1,000 returned to their jobs or applied to do so, he adds.</p>
<p>"If we had not gone public they would still be on strike - until the province legislated them back to work because of health concerns around H1N1," Miller says.</p>
<p>But union leaders insist the public offer shored up the strikers' resolve. Says Dembinski: "It showed they were taking money that should have been for our wages and using it to buy out our sick time."</p>
<p>A breakthrough came July 14, when local 416 made clear it was prepared to negotiate the sick bank.</p>
<p>What changed?</p>
<p>Ferguson says the union realized that a short-term disability plan, which pays workers only when injured or ill, would be better for junior members. Last year, the city says about 300 members of the striking union locals lost pay while ill or injured because they didn't have enough banked sick days to cover time off.</p>
<p>Clinching the issue was a mediator's proposal of a "grandfathering" option, Ferguson says.</p>
<p>Dembinski was livid. She still doesn't approve of anything other than the old sick bank - even though she and her bargaining committee unanimously recommended the final settlement to members.</p>
<p>"I can say that we never agreed to it," she says. "I disagree still with giving (sick plan) options."</p>
<p>She makes clear, however, that the prospect of local 79 staying out on strike while 416 settled would not have been pleasant.</p>
<p>All agree the contract offers some improvements, particularly with new apprenticeship and training programs and internship for youth from at-risk neighbourhoods. The unions are also ecstatic the city has recognized family day as a holiday.</p>
<p>Still, few expect the conflicts from amalgamation and the bad blood to be gone by the next round of bargaining. Does another strike loom in 2012?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Colleges study how to beat swine flu; Post-secondary plans range from online lessons to hand sanitizers and profs prepared to pinch-hit</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>

</p>
<p>Post-secondary institutions are preparing for the return of students in two weeks with battle plans for swine flu that include room service in dorms, designated washroom stalls and ubiquitous hand-sanitizing stations.</p>
<p>In preparation for a second wave of the H1N1 influenza virus, administrators spent the summer fine-tuning pandemic plans that include major education campaigns during orientation week.</p>
<p>"We're in full flight here, putting communiques together for student orientation ... We're planning all kinds of things," said Susan Lilholt, spokeswoman for the Ontario College of Art and Design.</p>
<p>At the University of Toronto, training for resident dons begins Monday and H1N1 is high on the agenda.</p>
<p>"Dons are getting trained on what to do when a student gets ill. Obviously, we would try to isolate that student from the general population, bring them meals to their rooms," explained university spokeswoman Laurie Stephens.</p>
<p>Infected residents who are well enough to travel to the cafeteria will be required to wear masks and take their meals back to their rooms, she said. Some washroom stalls and sinks in the dorms will be designated for use by ill students.</p>
<p>The university is installing 150 additional hand-sanitizing stations, bringing the total to 1,115. Some had been in place before H1N1 hit.</p>
<p>Post-secondary institutions are also making plans to deal with potentially high rates of absenteeism - from putting lessons online and hiring contract teachers to getting professors to pinch-hit for each other. "The professors are being actively coached and advised on making these plans in the event that they are away," Stephens said.</p>
<p>All pandemic plans consider worst-case scenarios, including the remote possibility of widespread serious illness that would force institutions to temporarily close.</p>
<p>"There are lots of strategies we are looking at in terms of how we can work away from the facility if it were necessary to close, but we don't anticipate that," Lilholt said.</p>
<p>Institutions are using posters, email, student handbooks and websites to hammer home messages on proper handwashing techniques, correct ways to cough and sneeze, and staying home if ill.</p>
<p>"If we can be very proactive on that side, then we can go a long way to prevent H1N1 from taking hold in this institution," Humber College spokesperson Sylvia Kowal said.</p>
<p>Humber administrators are even taking to the airwaves to get out the message on the college's own radio and TV stations. With three campuses, the college also has the option of moving students to other campuses if necessary.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious disease prevention at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, credited the institutions for being so proactive. "They're on it. It's nice to see they are so prepared," he said.</p>
<p>The measures will also help reduce the number of colds and other influenza viruses, he said, citing studies that show hand washing more than five times a day cuts respiratory infection rates by almost 50 per cent.</p>

<p>Brett Favre's decision to come out of retirement and sign with the Minnesota Vikings continues to reverberate around the NFL. Man, that guy comes back more often than beer at a high school party ... Favre was to play in Friday night's pre-season game against the Kansas City Chiefs. The contest was delayed for an hour while Favre wavered on the coin toss ... Here's Janice Hough, the Left Coast Sports Babe: "At least we won't have to worry about seeing Favre on the celebrity version of Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? He could never get past 'Is that your final answer?' " ... "Personally I cannot imagine an NFL without Brett Favre," noted comedy writer Alex Kaseberg, "primarily because he won't give me a freaking chance."</p>
<p>Erstwhile New York Giants receiver Plaxico Burress -- who accidentally shot himself in the right thigh in November -- pleaded guilty Thursday to one count of attempted criminal possession of a weapon and accepted a plea bargain of two years in prison. It'll be interesting to see how Burress shakes free of the tight man-to-man coverage in the big house ... The NFL already has announced Burress won't be suspended when he gets out, meaning he can resume his playing career if some team's willing to give him a shot ... If a team signs Burress, will it be rebuilding or just reloading? ... If you're interested, you can order a Philadelphia Eagles jersey for your dog with Michael Vick's name on the back. It comes with instructions on how to make your dog roll over and play dead.</p>
<p>A felony robbery charge against Chicago Blackhawks star Patrick Kane has been dismissed, but the NHLer still faces two misdemeanors for his role in an alleged scrap with a Buffalo cab driver over 20 cents. All Kane wants is a fare trial ... According to the blog Coming Down the Pipe -- operated in part by former Global Regina sports reporter Dean Millard -- the AHL's Norfolk Admirals are trying to line up an outdoor game on the deck of the aircraft carrier USS Eisenhower. Wouldn't that make it an Ike hockey game? ... Perhaps the Admirals should consider signing The Golden Jet (Bobby Hull) and Bomber (Ken Baumgartner) to one-game contracts for that contest.</p>
<p>Phoenix Suns guard Steve Nash complained recently that his former teammate, Cleveland Cavaliers centre Shaquille O'Neal, took Nash's idea for a reality show and turned it into Shaq Vs. If that's true, Shaq has recorded the first steal of his Cavs career ... In the wake of the stunning finish at the PGA Championship on Sunday, Late Show host David Letterman offered his "Top Ten Tiger Woods Excuses" earlier this week. The list included "Spent the previous night with John Daly," "Would you practise if you had a hot Swedish wife?" and "What do you expect? Y.E. Yang wins everything!" ... John O'Hara, 23, blew a .289 on a breathalyser after he was pulled over in Gary, Ind., while driving three other people home in a golf cart. O'Hara apparently took too many shots on the 19th hole.</p>
<p>This week's wacky soccer story comes from Pohnpei, one of the four states that comprise the Federated States of Micronesia. Officials on Pohnpei have hired 25-year-old Briton Paul Watson to coach the island's national team, which has never won a game in its history. If Watson can turn around the Pohnpei side, he'd be a natural to join another team with a similar winning percentage -- provided the Toronto Maple Leafs would hire him, of course ... "Three members of the Nippon Ham Fighters baseball team are suffering from swine flu," scribbled Gary Loewen of the Toronto Sun. "Hopefully they will be cured soon." ... The last word this week goes to Chicago Cubs legend Ernie Banks, who was asked during a recent appearance on Denver's KCKK radio why he signed every autograph request he got as a player. Replied Banks: "I wanted to sign every kid's autograph that came up to me because I thought, 'One day, I might have to ask this kid for a job.' "</p>

<p>Re: "Alberta braces for flu outbreak," Aug. 17.</p>
<p>Examination of our preparations for the arrival of a severe H1N1 outbreak, and our preparations for severe global warming leads to an interesting comparison. In the case of H1N1, it is recognized that to prepare for the worst is prudent, and that the possibility of a severe pandemic is significant enough to warrant action, even if the probability of an occurrence is less than 100 per cent.</p>
<p>Organizations are encouraged to create action plans and are provided government assistance. Public support for pandemic planning is widespread. Organized resistance to the possibility of a severe outbreak and to funding prevention is absent. The acceptance of the body of evidence assembled by the scientific community could be said to be universal.</p>
<p>In the case of global warming, the evidence is denied, to prepare for the worst is ridiculed. The scientific community is treated with disdain. "The science is not there" has become a common debating point. Any action to reduce global warming is actively resisted at every turn, most notably at governmental levels. Both events portend doomsday scenarios, but one is taken seriously and the other is not. Interesting times we live in.</p>

<p>Too much compassion</p>
<p>We can't tell which nauseates us more: the hero's welcome afforded to Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Ali al-Megrahi when he deplaned in Libya, or the Scottish government's fatuous decision to release him.</p>
<p>Megrahi's bomb, aboard a Pan Am flight in 1988, killed 270 people over the Scottish town of Lockerbie. Convicted of murder in 2001, he served only eight years of a life sentence before Scotland released him from prison on compassionate grounds. He is said to have terminal cancer.</p>
<p>What a travesty. Should a man to whom compassion is a mystery - say, someone who blew an airliner full of innocent people out of the sky - be given compassion? Not in this case, anyway.</p>
<p>An absolute mistake</p>
<p>An editorial in the Canadian Medical Association Journal invites Ottawa to name a national "health czar" with legal authority to tell the provinces what to do about swine flu if the pandemic becomes a full-blown public health crisis.</p>
<p>Everybody knows medical students work hard, but perhaps the good doctors skipped some political-science classes: Health is a provincial responsibility in Canada, and good luck to the federal bureaucrat, no matter how autocratic his title, who tries to push the provinces around.</p>
<p>Federalism works for Canada, but it does have its costs, and inefficiency is one such cost. Federal and provincial officials are trying to work out effective responses to a flu crisis, and we expect that they'll do reasonably well.</p>
<p>But a top-down model didn't work out too well for the real czars, finally, and it won't work in pandemic response, either.</p>
<p>SIGNS OF LIFE</p>
<p>The Canada Revenue Agency has finally managed to schedule a meeting with the Swiss bank <span class="companylink">UBS</span>, beginning the process of finding out if that bank's illicit activities in the U.S. were duplicated here. It's about time.</p>
<p>The U.S. has hammered a big spike into the fortress of Swiss bank secrecy, and the crack it created is spreading. Meanwhile, Britain has worked out a deal with Liechtenstein which will partly lift the veil of bank secrecy there. The U.S. government will pursue other Swiss banks, and is turning its attention to Singapore. Big countries are pushing hard to end bank secrecy, the enabler of tax evasion on a grand scale.</p>
<p>Canada, finally, has joined the parade, in a small and diffident way.</p>
<p>Better late than never.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Extra fees for treating flu patients 'outrageous'</b>
</div><div>Tiffany Crawford   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>It's "outrageous" that any Canadian doctors should be negotiating extra fees for treating H1N1 flu patients during a pandemic, says the president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses.</p>
<p>Linda Silas said she was "stunned" to hear doctors in Alberta have negotiated a special payment rate as high as $518 an hour, in the event the provincial government is forced to declare a public health emergency over the flu pandemic. Alberta nurses, who are salaried employees of the health system, will not be offered enhanced payment.</p>
<p>Silas, whose organization represents 158,000 nurses in every province except Quebec, called the plan "utter nonsense."</p>
<p>"It's total craziness. I'm surprised the government and the AMA [Alberta Medical Association] would stoop so low in negotiating an outrageous rate in case of a public crisis," she said.</p>
<p>"Yes, nurses are under contract; well, so are doctors. None of them work for free. When we are talking about a public crisis that may happen, we think it's ridiculous."</p>
<p>Saskatchewan may follow Alberta's example. Health officials there will meet next week with the medical community to discuss plans for compensating front-line physicians in the event of an H1N1 flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Silas said Alberta's approach will set a precedent for other provinces to follow, adding that . governments should negotiate how to protect front-line healthcare workers from infection, not how much to pay them.</p>
<p>"If I was negotiating doctor's salaries in New Brunswick, of course I'd be asking for the same thing," she said.</p>
<p>"They are ... doing something outrageous."</p>

<p>The real games driving the next federal election may have less to do with policy or polls than skiing, skating and scoring.</p>
<p>Amid the madness swirling over a reason for Canada's opposition trio to defeat the Conservative government --billions more for employment insurance reform? On the eve of an economic recovery?Are they insane? --there is the weirdest consideration of them all.</p>
<p>The 2010 Vancouver Olympic Winter Games, some backroom boys insist, could force a vote this fall to avoid an election conflict early next year.</p>
<p>Ask a Liberal or a New Democrat why this Conservative government has to be defeated just 10 months into its theoretical five-year mandate and they say the Olympic Games complicate the government's logical demise during February or March budget confidence votes.</p>
<p>There are two theories bolstering this seemingly disconnected logic.</p>
<p>Some figure Finance Minister Jim Flaherty might be just Machiavellian enough to drop his budget while the torch relay is still nearing the Olympic cauldron, forcing a campaign during the Games. Seems far-fetched to me, but so was the idea of inserting a ban on political party financing in last fall's economic update.</p>
<p>The second political consideration is that Canada will finally score a bunch of gold medals as the host country. Montreal's Olympics in 1976? Nadda. Calgary's in 1988? Gold medal meltdown.</p>
<p>But Vancouver, well, there are mighty high expectations Canadians will finally hear their national anthem played on a domestic podium. That, the backrooms fret, would send a giddy electorate dancing on happy feet into polling stations where they might be more inclined to vote Conservative, a particularly important consideration in the crucial election battleground of southern British Columbia.</p>
<p>Yes, avoiding an election based on the men's hockey team landing gold is a tad odd, but so were reports Prime Minister Stephen Harper will base his campaign on seeking a majority mandate, at least until a new Ipsos Reid poll came out Friday that showed the Conservatives surging ahead and flirting with 40 per cent voter support.</p>
<p>But has the Olympic afterglow ever influenced an election outcome? The short answer is . . . maybe.</p>
<p>An analysis of prior host countries and subsequent election results does not suggest a good or bad incumbent correlation, but national patriotism and pride are intangibles when voters enter a polling station.</p>
<p>Canada's two Olympic tours of duty clearly did not resonate at the ballot box. The Calgary Games were followed eight months later by a federal election where Brian Mulroney reclaimed a majority from a single-issue campaign over free trade. It would be difficult to link fallout from the Montreal Summer Games of 1976 to an election three years later where a guy named Joe Clark briefly interrupted the Liberal reign.</p>
<p>Look hard and you might see a vague pattern in the American experience. Bill Clinton was handily re-elected following the Atlanta Games of 1996 and Ronald Reagan crushed Walter Mondale after the Los Angeles Games of 1984. But how to explain poor ol' Jimmy Carter, who got thrashed despite the patriotic fallout from the U. S. hockey team's Miracle on Ice at Lake Placid in 1980?</p>
<p>If nothing else, this shows the lunacy that has ensnared Ottawa as a listless political summer limps toward a fall with nothing on the agenda beyond a date for another neverendum referendum on a minority government.</p>
<p>Lost in the election speculation is any consideration of what's best for economically apprehensive Canadians.</p>
<p>This Parliament has, despite its venom-laced bickering, passed a robust agenda to tackle the recession, dealt with law-and-order concerns and kick-started another military equipment buildup.</p>
<p>To force the second $300-million election in a single year over a standardized and enriched employment insurance plan or to avoid a scheduling conflict with next February's Olympics borders on contempt for the voter.</p>
<p>Just in case they need a decent reason to avoid a November vote, consider this: If swine flu returns with a vengeance, any fall campaign would be reduced to empty rallies and door-knocking contact with voters through surgical masks.</p>
<p>When a sports event is an excuse to move up an unnecessary election, surely a pandemic is a reason to delay it.</p>

</p>
<p>SANTIAGO, Chile -- Chile said Friday that tests show H1N1 flu has jumped to birds, opening a new chapter in the global epidemic.</p>
<p>Top flu and animal-health experts with the United Nations in Rome and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta were monitoring the situation closely, but said the infected turkeys have suffered only mild effects, easing concern about a potentially dangerous development.</p>
<p>Chile's turkey meat remains safe to eat, they said, and so far there have been no signs of a potentially dangerous mutation.</p>
<p>Chile's health ministry said it ordered a quarantine Friday for two turkey farms outside the port city of Valparaiso after genetic tests confirmed sick birds were afflicted with the same virus that has caused a pandemic among humans.</p>
<p>So far, the virus -- a mixture of human, pig and bird genes -- has proved to be very contagious but no more deadly than common seasonal flu. However, virus experts fear a more dangerous and easily transmitted strain could emerge if it combines again with avian flu, which is far more deadly but tougher to pass along.</p>
<p>The farms' owner, <span class="companylink">Sopraval SA</span>, alerted the agriculture ministry after egg production dropped at the farms.</p>
