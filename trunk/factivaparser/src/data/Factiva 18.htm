<p>Canada's blood donation system has taken a minor hit so far because of the H1N1 pandemic but Canadian Blood Services is bracing for a deeper impact as the flu season wears on and the number of donors could drop.</p>
<p>Ron Vezina, national director of media relations for Canadian Blood Services, says the agency is still meeting demand from hospitals for blood and there is no cause for great concern at this point. The agency however, is trying to build its inventory to mitigate the threat posed to it by high donor, volunteer and staff absenteeism in the coming weeks. "From our point of view, it's (an issue) of supply. That's why we want to ramp up before great numbers of people start getting sick," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>While Vezina said CBS is "still in good shape," there has been "an operational impact."</p>
<p>The charitable organization that manages the country's blood supply system is comprised of of 4,000 staff and relies on 17,000 volunteers to operate 19,000 mobile donor clinics every year and 41 permanent collection sites.</p>
<p>That's a substantial workforce and, like any employer, Canadian Blood Services has had to prepare for volunteer and staff absenteeism. The work CBS is engaged in, however, is a life-and-death matter and it acknowledges that absenteeism could affect its ability to collect, test, process and distribute blood.</p>
<p>Some mobile clinics at schools, community centres, office buildings and at other public places were bumped in recent weeks because the facilities were needed for H1N1 vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>Vezina said they've seen an increased number of cancelled appointments over the last six weeks. The CBS estimates that about 700 appointments per week have been cancelled or the donor didn't show up.</p>
<p>While thousands of units of blood haven't been lost because of the flu pandemic, the agency is anticipating a drop in donations and is working hard to ward off that threat.</p>
<p>"The holiday season is...always a challenging time," he said.</p>
<p>There is no risk of getting the flu from giving or receiving blood.</p>

<p>Five more Albertans have died after catching the H1N1 flu, but health officials say a total of 34 deaths so far isn't unusual during a flu season.</p>
<p>"We're not out of range," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>While more people will get sick during this pandemic since no one has built up immunity, between 11 and 91 people die during the regular flu season.</p>
<p>To prevent the spread of the flu, the province is expanding its vaccination campaign as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, people with chronic conditions aged 10 to 17 and 55 to 64 began lining up for their shots alongside pregnant women, kids under 10 with various chronic health conditions and caregivers of infants under six months old. Today, the group expands to include those aged 45 to 54 with chronic conditions.</p>
<p>While there are 200,000 doses leftover from last week on top of another 237,000 received Thursday, the Westmount clinic hit a glitch Monday morning when nursing staff opened the new fridge holding 3,600 doses and discovered a faulty breaker failed to set off the fridge's alarm. The inside of the fridge was 28 C, said Dr. Marcia Johnson, deputy medical officer of health for Alberta Health Services.</p>
<p>The H1N1 vaccine is supposed to be kept between 2 C and 8 C.</p>
<p>"We don't want this to happen. That's why we have these alarms, that's why we have these special fridges," Johnson said. "With many of these programs, we have bells and suspenders and a little bit of Scotch Tape and you're counting on a number of different strategies to keep things safe."</p>
<p>While the incident is being investigated, the 3,600 doses are in quarantine at the Edmonton vaccine depot. The manufacturer will be working with the health region and Alberta Health and Wellness to determine if the vaccine remains effective and can still be used.</p>
<p>Health department spokesman John Tuckwell said evidence suggests the vaccine can be stored in room temperature for up to 48 hours without being compromised.</p>
<p>"There is a chance it is still effective and we don't want to throw it out," Johnson said.</p>
<p>Alberta's vaccine shortage will remain for the next two weeks, Corriveau said. He hopes to open vaccination clinics sometime next week to a second tier of risk groups, including seniors, police, paramedics and firefighters, but said he's expecting an even smaller shipment of the vaccine than this week. Of the 237,000 doses received Thursday, almost 127,000 are unadjuvanted, meant only for pregnant women. Regular doses are preferred for the general population since the additive boosts immunity.</p>
<p>"We have at least one more week of tight supply," Corriveau said. "In Alberta, we're very near that peak (of the flu's second wave)."</p>
<p>The five newest deaths included two middle-aged adults from Edmonton, a man and a woman. Two middle-aged men from the Calgary area and a middle-aged woman from northern Alberta also died.</p>
<p>All 34 people who have died have been adults, and 33 had underlying health problems.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Albertans unhappy with province's handling of pandemic, poll says</b>
</div><div>Allison Cross   </div>

<p>Albertans are the least satisfied Canadians when it comes to their province's handling of the H1N1 pandemic, according to poll results that may reflect a provincial vaccination effort that saw hockey players treated before people in high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Results of a nationwide EKOS poll released on Thursday show that 58 per cent of Albertans surveyed said they disapproved of the way their provincial or local services had dealt with the H1N1 pandemic, while 26 per cent said they approved.</p>
<p>Nationally, 42 per cent of Canadians approved of their provincial and local officials' handling of the pandemic, while 35 per cent disapproved, the poll results suggested. Twenty-three per cent skipped the question.</p>
<p>There were 1,745 people surveyed for the poll from Nov. 4 to Nov. 10. The margin of error was plus or minus</p>
<p>2.4 percentage points nationally, but shot up to 7.3 percentage points for the Alberta results.</p>
<p>Alberta was the only province, according to the survey, where more people disapproved than approved of how local agencies had handled the pandemic.</p>
<p>Alberta's vaccination effort has been roundly criticized in that province.</p>
<p>Alberta was one of the jurisdictions that initially offered the vaccine to all residents, not just those in high-risk categories. Clinics were unable to meet the subsequent demand and had to temporarily shut down, then reopen to only serve high-risk groups.</p>
<p>Controversy erupted when it was revealed that players with the Calgary Flames and their families had access to the vaccine ahead of the children and pregnant women who were considered to be at high risk. Two health officials were fired in the fallout from the scandal.</p>
<p>Another public opinion poll, released Tuesday by Angus Reid, also found Canadians are critical of the government's handling of the flu virus.</p>
<p>Of the 1,003 Canadian adults surveyed online in the last week of October, 36 per cent said they were satisfied with their provincial government's level of preparedness for H1N1, which represented a 20-point drop since a survey conducted in October.</p>
<p>The margin of error for the Angus Reid poll was 3.1 per cent, 19 times out of 20.</p>
<p>Premier Ed Stelmach said on Thursday the disappointment Albertans feel about the government's handling of H1N1 vaccinations may outpace feelings in the rest of the country because the province didn't use all the tools at hand, specifically getting support from municipalities.</p>
<p>"Maybe it's because we went to treating everyone and there were significant lineups and we could have done the job better in terms of involving Alberta's emergency management," Stelmach said.</p>
<p>The premier explained the province feared calling the H1N1 vaccination campaign an emergency issue. But, the province could have and should have drawn on the emergency management services of municipalities, and all government supports from the solicitor general's department to the department of health.</p>
<p>Stelmach said he had a good conversation with Prime Minister Stephen Harper earlier this week, and the federal government has assured the provinces there will be a smooth supply of H1N1 vaccine doses.</p>
<p>On the recent deaths of patients in connection to swine flu, Stelmach said, "It is tragic to the families that lose loved ones to influenza and again could have been people that maybe some of their health conditions were predisposed to something else." With files from Trish Audette</p>

</div><div>Sharon Kirkey   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>928 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>All but the youngest children need only a single half-dose of H1N1 vaccine, federal health officials have decided-- a decision that means many parents of healthy children who have already endured waits hours long to have them vaccinated will not have to line up again for a second shot.</p>
<p>The new recommendations for vaccine dosing for children between three and nine years of age will free up vaccine and make more shots available to the general public sooner, officials say.</p>
<p>About two million doses of H1N1 vaccine will be shipped to the provinces next week, Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health</p>
<p>on Thursday evening.</p>
<p>"We're starting to get to the point for a fairly steady flow out there," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>In Canada, 26 new deaths related to H1N1 were reported to the Public Health Agency of Canada between Tuesday and Thursday of this week, bringing the total number of deaths to 161.</p>
<p>Seven more H1N1 deaths were announced on the Prairies on Thursday, including five in Alberta and two in Saskatchewan, while deaths were also announced in Ottawa and St. John's, N.L.</p>
<p>Based on what's known so far, children and young adults have the highest rates of H1N1, and health officials in the United States warned on Thursday that the pediatric death toll from the pandemic could be much greater than what is normally seen with seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Against that backdrop, the World Health Organization has issued new guidelines that could push wider use of flu drugs in children and adults to keep H1N1 infections from progressing to more severe or fatal disease.</p>
<p>The vast majority of people infected with H1N1 have mild symptoms and recover fully without any medical treatment. But H1N1 can cause severe pneumonia even in healthy young people, and the virus can take lives within a week, Dr. Nikki Shindo, a medical officer with WHO's Global Influenza Program , said in news briefing from Geneva on Thursday.</p>
<p>"The window of opportunity is very narrow to reverse the progression of the disease," Shindo said. "The medicine needs to be administered before the virus destroys the lungs."</p>
<p>"We have heard that doctors involved in caring for very sick patients in intensive-care units regretted that the patient arrived too late, and even the most sophisticated medical procedures could not save their lives," she said.</p>
<p>"We asked the doctors,'What could have been done differently to avoid the tragic outcomes?' All of them answered, without exception, that things may have been very different if they had been treated with antiviral medicine early."</p>
<p>Vaccines and anti-virals are the cornerstones of Canada's strategy to fight human swine flu, and children six months to under five years of age were among the priority groups first targeted for vaccination when the shots were released Oct. 26.</p>
<p>At that time, federal public health officials recommended children under 10 receive the adjuvant vaccine in two doses, administered at least 21 days apart. Each dose contains half the adult dose.</p>
<p>But preliminary findings from a Spanish study of healthy children suggest a single half-dose of adjuvanted vaccine provides sufficient protection against the virus in healthy children ages three-to nine-years-old. Adjuvants are compounds added to vaccines to boost the body's immune response to the shots.</p>
<p>"We're reasonably confident that one dose will be sufficient," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>According to the updated recommendations:</p>
<p>-Children between six months of age and under three years of age should receive two half-doses of adjuvanted vaccine, administered at least 21 days apart. The recommendation for this age group remains unchanged.</p>
<p>Children with chronic health conditions who are over three-years-old and under 10 should receive their first half-dose of the H1N1 flu vaccine as soon as possible, and a second dose 21 days later. The vaccine has not been approved for children under six months of age.</p>
<p>-Healthy children over three years of age and under 10 should only receive a single half-dose of the H1N1 vaccine, and do not need to return for a second vaccine for now--a recommendation that may be updated as more information becomes available.</p>
<p>The recommendations have been reviewed with the Canadian Paediatric Society and the provinces and territories, Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>In the U.S., health officials said Thursday an estimated 22 million Americans had been infected with H1N1 from April through Oct. 17, and that an estimated 3,900 people have died so far in the first six months of the pandemic, including 540 children. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 98,000 people have been hospitalized, including 36,000 children.</p>
<p>The numbers--based on statistical modelling and flu-related hospitalizations covering 10 states--are several-fold higher than earlier estimates.</p>
<p>"We are going to continue to have challenges with this pandemic," Dr. Anne Schuchat, director of the CDC's Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said. "I think it's important for all of us to remember it's a marathon and not a sprint."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said there is no evidence H1N1 has peaked. "We're continuing to see more cases, more people presenting with (flu-like symptoms), more prescriptions for Tamiflu. The Americans are five or six weeks ahead of us in terms of their second wave of the outbreak. We've still got a long way to go."</p>

</p>
<p>Toronto --</p>
<p>Ontario's troubled Health ministry has lost its deputy minister.</p>
<p>Ron Sapsford, who has held the position since 2005, informed the province on Friday morning that he will leave in January.</p>
<p>Mr. Sapsford was on the defensive last month, when he was called before an all-party legislative committee to testify about his role in the eHealth scandal. Although he oversaw Ontario's efforts to digitalize its health records, he denied having known about the controversial consulting contracts and expense filings that led the provincial opposition to complain of a "billion-dollar boondoggle."</p>
<p>"From my point of view, all the rules were in place and understood," Mr. Sapsford told the committee, saying he had warned eHealth chairman Alan Hudson and chief executive officer Sarah Kramer - both of whom have since left those roles - that they should follow proper procedures.</p>
<p>Despite the recent controversy, Mr. Sapsford was well-regarded by fellow civil servants.</p>
<p>"One of the best deputy ministers of health I have seen and worked with," Tony Dean, the former cabinet secretary and head of the Ontario Public Service, said Friday.</p>
<p>The news of Mr. Sapsford's departure comes just a month after David Caplan stepped down as health minister because of revelations in the provincial auditor-general's report on eHealth.</p>
<p>With Dr. Hudson also no longer involved in provincial health policy, after several years as Premier Dalton McGuinty's point-man on reducing waiting times, the government's largest ministry is experiencing almost complete turnover in its senior leadership.</p>
<p>In a statement, Health Minister Deb Matthews thanked Mr. Sapsford for his service, noting he is the longest-serving deputy minister of health since the 1970s.</p>
<p>Ms. Matthews credited Mr. Sapsford with introducing innovative family health teams and nurse practitioner clinics, and said changes made under his leadership have made the public health system able to better cope with the H1N1 flu.</p>

</p>
<p>Parents eager to take their children to H1N1 vaccination clinics and parents who dread waiting in line twice will benefit from a double dose of good news delivered Thursday.</p>
<p>Toronto health officials announced clinics will soon vaccinate healthy school-age children. Federal health officials, meanwhile, announced that healthy children 3 to 9 years old need only one shot, not the two originally recommended.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada said clinical trials in Europe have shown that a single half-dose is sufficient for these children.</p>
<p>"This is good news for parents of healthy children and for Canadians," said chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones. "It frees up resources that can be devoted to immunizing priority at-risk populations, which means that the H1N1 vaccine will be available for the general public sooner."</p>
<p>Dr. David McKeown, Toronto's medical officer of health, said he is expecting an announcement from the province Friday about vaccinating school-age children, who were not on the previous priority list.</p>
<p>"Our clinics will be ready to immunize children as soon as the province makes the announcement," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Health ministry spokesman David Jensen said the province is still deciding when to expand the priority list and what ages to include.</p>
<p>McKeown said Toronto will not hold vaccination clinics in schools, saying this would be difficult and inefficient. Instead, existing clinics will be kept open seven days a week starting Monday, after they close Sunday to give staff a rest. Children will also be able to get vaccinated by physicians.</p>
<p>H1N1 rates are still on the rise in Toronto, McKeown said, and do "not yet show any sign of levelling off or declining."</p>
<p>To reduce pressure on hospital emergency rooms, the city is opening five flu assessment centres to offer treatments and referrals but not vaccinations.</p>
<p>Federal recommendations for children between 6 months and 3 years and those with underlying health conditions won't change. These children should still obtain two half-doses of the version of the vaccine that contains an adjuvant, a chemical additive that stretches supply and boosts immunity. The two doses should be administered at least 21 days apart.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones said federal recommendations were never meant to be "set in stone," but to "evolve based on new knowledge and evidence."</p>
<p>Results of more research might bring further changes.</p>
<p>But that day might not come until demand has waned. Dr. Donald Low, laboratory director at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, believes H1N1 has peaked in Canada and the country should be virtually free of the ailment within a month.</p>
<p>This would certainly please Canadian Blood Services, which has seen an uptick in cancelled donation appointments, from 13 per cent to 15 per cent, because of illness.</p>
<p>Concerned that H1N1 will cause an even greater decline, blood agency officials are appealing to members of the public to roll up their sleeves.</p>
<p>"We've got a robust and healthy inventory, but we'd like to have more as a contingency," said spokesman Ron Vezina.</p>

<p>Waterloo, Ont. -- At first, I thought your front-page headline Vaccinating The Nation: $1.5-Billion And Climbing (Nov. 12) was referring to the number of hockey players and highly paid executives in Canada who got their swine flu shots. In my fairly wide circle of, clearly, obedient friends and relatives (ages 8 to 97), I know of no one who has yet been allowed to be vaccinated. We're not too sure what to do about it, but it's all getting pretty tiring. Could someone just cut to the chase and tell us where and when we can get vaccinated?</p>

</p>
<p>LAKE PLACID, N.Y. -- Canadian figure skater Kevin Reynolds has a tall order this week in his quest to get to the Olympic Games in his home province of British Columbia.</p>
<p>He finished fourth in Canada last year, but based on last year's results at the world championships in Los Angeles, there are only two berths for Canadian men.</p>
<p>After an eighth-place finish at his first Grand Prix, Cup of China, several weeks ago, Reynolds, 20, is at Skate America this week to make amends and show why he should be part of the race for the two spots.</p>
<p>The Olympic spots will be awarded at the Canadian championships in London, Ont., in January.</p>
<p>His big goal this season is the 2010 Olympics, he said yesterday after practice. “It's a very tight race between the second to fifth men in Canada. I'm just aiming to skate the best I can at nationals and see where the chips fall.''</p>
<p>He said competing at the Olympics in his home province has been his dream since the Vancouver Olympics was announced in 2003. “I remember where I was when they announced it,” he said. “I was training that day and there were all these cameras there. It seems like yesterday.”</p>
<p>Reynolds was a child prodigy, winning national titles at the lower age levels. His forte was jumping. Since then, he has become known as Canada's Quad King, even as a junior. At the 2008 Canadian championships, he became the first Canadian man to land a quadruple-triple-triple jump combination.</p>
<p>But he realizes now that jumps just aren't enough, so he has gone to Shae-Lynn Bourne to design his new short program to a jazz medley. Last year, he tried to increase his presentation marks by having his choreography done by Russian diva Tatiana Tarasova. He managed to finish fourth in both of his Grand Prix events.</p>
<p>This year, to work with Bourne, he travelled to Toronto and spent a week creating the short program in the Elvis Stojko Arena. “That was an interesting experience, working with her,” he said. “She's so free. She has a totally different style of movement than the Russian choreography that I had last year.”</p>
<p>Reynolds went for jazz because he's worked with jazz in the past and likes the style of music. “It really fits me,” he said. “I'm feeling comfortable with it.” His long program is a Led Zeppelin medley, created by coach Joanne McLeod and former ice dancer Megan Wing.</p>
<p>But the world didn't get to see his new programs at their best at his Grand Prix in China a few weeks ago, because Reynolds had a close encounter with the H1N1 virus and the Chinese protocol for dealing with it.</p>
<p>He finished only eighth at Cup of China, weak and ill.</p>
<p>Reynolds fell ill on the Sunday before he was to leave for Beijing, and had a fever on Monday. He was to leave on the 11-hour flight from Vancouver on Tuesday.</p>
<p>When he arrived in Beijing, temperature sensors in the airport picked up a temperature of 38.2 degrees, which was .7 degrees above the threshold that China's influenza program allows.</p>
<p>Reynolds said three officials dragged him aside to a small room to check his temperature.</p>
<p>“They all shook their heads and I was dragged to isolation until they could bring an ambulance to the tarmac,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Reynolds, with mask on, was escorted by ambulance with Canadian team doctor Jim Bovard to a nearby Chinese hospital, where medical people took blood samples and swabs to see if he had the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>McLeod was left behind to gather the luggage.</p>
<p>“With all the work you do, you're so determined to skate, you're trying not to psychologically think or feel sick,” McLeod said.</p>
<p>Reynolds has yet to see the results of the blood tests, but Chinese officials told him to stay in isolation at his hotel. Reynolds stayed in isolation the rest of that day, and part of the next, but then attended a practice under Bovard's supervision.</p>
<p>He was determined to skate. “I went there to do a job, and to skate and that's what I did,” Reynolds said.</p>
<p>Reynolds said Dr. Bovard believed the skater had a mild case of H1N1.</p>
<p>Reynolds said he lost a couple of pounds over the ordeal, and his legs felt weak. He couldn't land a quad all week.</p>
<p>But particularly over the past couple of days, Reynolds has found the strength in his legs again.</p>
<p>Yesterday in practice at the 1980 Olympic rink, Reynolds was solid, landing an effortless quadruple Salchow – triple toe loop combination. His confidence is growing.</p>
<p>He'll need it. This week, he competes against world champion Evan Lysacek of the United States and Tomas Verner of the Czech Republic, fourth in the world last year, but a versatile skater that has what Reynolds seeks – both technical and artistic power.</p>
<p>Florent Amodio of France, a former world junior champion, and Brandon Mroz of United States are also in the field.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Second H1N1 wave takes lethal toll on Canadians; Tally of dead has surpassed 190, but the season's peak isn't even here yet, chief national public health officer says</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO AND KAREN HOWLETT   </div>

</p>
<p>TORONTO -- A sudden spike in H1N1 deaths over the past week reveals that the pandemic virus is taking a far greater toll on Canadians during the second wave, raising fears that it is just as severe, if not worse, than seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Ontario's confirmed tally of fatalities jumped to 61 from 37 last week; five more people died in Alberta since Tuesday; Quebec confirmed four deaths in the past 24 hours; and British Columbia recorded eight more deaths over the past week.</p>
<p>More than 190 Canadians have died from H1N1 – and with additional deaths expected, health officials say there is a heightened urgency to get more people vaccinated quickly, especially the young who have been so badly affected.</p>
<p>The death tally, which in the spring averaged two to four a week, is at least three times higher during this second wave as the virus spreads. “We haven't seen the peak yet, in my view,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said yesterday. “We will continue to see, unfortunately, more people in ICUs and hospitals, and, unfortunately, more deaths as well.”</p>
<p>The youngest victim so far was a two-month-old baby boy from London, Ont., who died earlier this month. H1N1 disproportionately affects younger people because it resembles a strain of flu that circulated before 1957, to which older people have been exposed.</p>
<p>Health officials on the ground are seeing more Canadians filling emergency rooms or showing severe H1N1 symptoms. In B.C., for example, there have been 202 new severe cases identified since the beginning of the month, for a total of 601 since April when the virus was first identified.</p>
<p>Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases prevention and control at the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said that as more people begin coming down with the virus, the death tally will continue climbing for a few more weeks.</p>
<p>“To my mind, it's purely a marker that there's more flu out there,” Dr. Gardam said. “The virus has not mutated. It's no more nasty than it was before. There's just more people with it.”</p>
<p>Some health officials have questioned the intense government focus on H1N1, saying it is a mild virus that has killed fewer people than the seasonal flu. The seasonal flu kills about 4,000 people each year and results in the hospitalization of tens of thousands more, but those deaths are estimated, whereas H1N1 deaths are confirmed.</p>
<p>“It's not fair to make the comparison,” said Kumanan Wilson, Canada research chair in public-health policy at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute. “On the ground level, this is definitely not that much milder than the seasonal flu as those mortality stats would suggest. It's as bad, if not worse as regular seasonal flu. That's the clinical experience.”</p>
<p>In the United States, numbers released yesterday show swine flu has killed an estimated 3,900 Americans, including more than 500 children, between April and mid-October; it has infected an estimated 22 million people and put 98,000 in hospital. The count is an extrapolation based on data from 10 states.</p>
<p>“What we are seeing in 2009 is unprecedented,” said Anne Schuchat of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And there's still a long flu season ahead. “I think projecting out forward is difficult.”</p>
<p>In Canada, about seven million doses of vaccine have so far been distributed to provinces and territories, and more will keep flowing over the next few weeks. Canada has ordered 50 million doses. Dr. Butler-Jones said surveys are being conducted and modelling done to get a sense of how many Canadians had the flu. But he said there's no reason to extrapolate the number of deaths in Canada, because health authorities are closely tracking that data.</p>
<p>“I'm sure that there's some that we're missing. But most are getting picked up, particularly the ICU ones, and obviously the deaths. So I don't think we're missing a lot in terms of the severe cases,” he said.</p>
<p>“We don't know for sure how many Canadians have had the flu … [but we'll] try and get some estimates as we go forward.”</p>

<p>Life manages to make you feel insignificant as a human. The 10-part nature series crisscrosses the world to reveal a stunning array of animals and their particularly clever survival skills. Deciding whether or not to get the H1N1 flu shot seems puny by comparison. Life (Sunday, 9 p.m., Discovery, Discovery HD) features an intoxicating blend of majestic high-definition footage, with a narrator (David Attenborough) gifted in the art of storytelling. Orchestra swells every time a beastie shows a feat of ingenuity ramp up the drama like it's a Stephen King thriller; there's the capuchin monkey who wields a rock like a hammer, the seal who must outwit a pod of whales, the baby penguin about to meet its maker and the terribly seductive Venus flytrap – each drama draws you in with its ruthless life and death consequences.</p>
<p> Filmed over four years, the cinematic feel of this documentary series is breathtaking, and that's after watching it on a computer screen – watching Life on a large TV in high definition should be something else. Repeats Thursday at 8 p.m. and Friday at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Also airing this week</p>
<p>Inside the Saudi Kingdom, Passionate Eye (Sunday 10 p.m. on CBC News Network). Made for the BBC, this is a rare inside look at the slow changes occurring in Saudi Arabia. A candid interview with a prince from the royal ruling family and an invitation to follow him around and hang out with his family give Westerners a fascinating taste of a very different world.</p>

</p>
<p>A severe nursing shortage has plagued remote Manitoba First Nations for the last three years, forcing two nursing stations to temporarily close and a dozen others to work with a mere fraction of their regular staff.</p>
<p>Data obtained through a federal access-to-information request reveal that the majority of Manitoba's 21 nursing stations were short an average of 45 per cent of their nurses between 2006 and 2009.</p>
<p>Health Canada data show that 13 of all nursing stations on northern Manitoba reserves were short more than half their regular complement of nurses for an entire year. Eight communities were short more than half their nursing staff for multiple calendar years.</p>
<p>For one year, two remote northern communities -- Shamattawa and Pauingassi -- averaged zero staff, and the nursing stations were forced to close for days at a time until relief staff could be flown in.</p>
<p>First Nations leaders say the chronic shortages make it more difficult to recruit nurses to northern communities and result in stressed-out, overworked staff who are more apt to make mistakes.</p>
<p>A recent Free Press investigation into tuberculosis revealed that a 2006 outbreak in Garden Hill went undetected for eight months after infectious patients said they visited the nursing station but were told to go home and take Tylenol. At the time, the nursing station was short five nurses.</p>
<p>"I think the longer we wait, the more lives we're going to lose," said Shamattawa First Nation Chief Jeffrey Napoakesik. "There's only so much this person can do with a stethoscope."</p>
<p>Health Canada refused an interview request from the Free Press. A federal spokeswoman sent an email statement denying that any nursing station in a Manitoba community was temporarily closed due to staff shortages -- even though their own federal data obtained by the Free Press refute that.</p>
<p>"In the past, there have been occasions where nursing stations have been closed due to staff shortages. However, in the last three years this has not occurred," the statement said.</p>
<p>The statement said some nursing stations have been temporarily closed due to "weather conditions."</p>
<p>Napoakesik said the nursing shortage was so bad in Shamattawa in 2007, the nursing station was forced to shut down for days at a time until relief nurses could be flown in.</p>
<p>Things haven't improved much since. Current data from 2009 show Shamattwa has the second-worst shortages in the province and is short 72 per cent of its regular full-time nurses.</p>
<p>"I remember that year that Health Canada (said they) would have no choice but to close the nursing station because there was no staff at that time," Napoakesik said.</p>
<p>About 1,350 people live in Shamattawa, a fly-in community on the north shore of God's River, 750 kilometres north of Winnipeg. Napoakesik said a doctor flies in twice a month, but there are still not enough nurses or doctors to deal with the health needs of a growing community. He said the nursing station is slated for an upgrade, since the medical equipment is so out of date there are no longer parts made to repair a broken X-ray machine.</p>
<p>The fallout, Napoakesik said, is a lack of access to proper medical care. Last week, he said, an elderly man died of a cancer that went undetected at the nursing station for a long time. Napoakesik said the community is upset that the man was not flown out for treatment and was told there was nothing wrong with him.</p>
<p>"This has to stop," said Manitoba Keewatinowi Okimakanak Grand Chief David Harper, the head of the lobby group that represents 30 northern First Nations.</p>
<p>"They (nurses) are not doctors and they're stressed out. We applaud their work and what they're trying to do, but there's going to be times when mistakes happen, and mistakes have happened."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, six-month-old Chace Barkman died of meningitis after his parents were repeatedly sent home from the Garden Hill nursing station with instructions to treat the baby's fever with a cool bath and Tylenol.</p>
<p>By the time he was flown for emergency treatment in Winnipeg, it was too late, and he died eight days later.</p>
<p>Harper said there needs to be a better way to recruit and train nurses from northern communities, because nurses are reluctant to sign up to work under the current high-stress conditions.</p>
<p>He said programs to train licensed practical nurses are underway in Oxford House and St. Theresa Point, but there are no LPN positions available in any nursing station.</p>
<p>"The numbers of nurses per population in First Nations communities is a third of what it is in the Canadian average," Harper said. "We don't have proper medical care."</p>

<p>Pandemic</p>
<p>preparation</p>
<p>Will there be extra staff during a pandemic?</p>
<p>Health Canada said in an email statement that the federal government contracts with nursing agencies to fill vacancies in nursing stations.</p>
<p>While they didn't say what that means for a pandemic, a spokeswoman for the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority said there are more than 100 doctors, nurses and medical residents who have signed up to volunteer to help out in northern communities in the event pandemic flu hits a remote First Nation.</p>
<p>The Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs reports that more than 40,000 people on reserves have been vaccinated against H1N1 -- close to half of the population in The stats</p>
<p>Who was the most short-staffed?</p>
<p>Health Canada supplied the Free Press with average nurse-shortage percentages for each calendar year between 2006 and 2009.</p>
<p>2006 -- Pauingassi, short 100 per cent of its nurses</p>
<p>2007 -- Shamattawa, short 100 per cent of its nurses</p>
<p>2008 -- Wasagamack, short 88 per cent of its nurses</p>
<p>2009 -- Pauingassi, short 79 per cent of its nurses</p>
<p>Who had the most staff?</p>
<p>Pukatawagan had a full complement of nurses for 2006, 2007, and 2008 -- the only community that recorded no nursing vacancies during that time. But the community has been short an average of 48 per cent of its nurses in 2009.</p>
<p>In 2009, the lowest vacancy rate in a nursing station was recorded in Garden Hill, which is short 21 per cent of its regular full-time nurses.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Don't forget steps to fend off common cold; Annoying seasonal sickness has been ignored during H1N1 fever</b>
</div><div>Jennifer Sygo   </div>
<div>For Canwest News Service</div>
<div>952 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Victoria Times Colonist</div><div>VTC</div><div>Final</div><div>D8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Victoria Times Colonist   </div>
</p>
<p>With all the H1N1 discourse and debate, the nation's focus is definitely on flu season. With so much attention given to the prevention and treatment of the flu, it seems that the other big winter illness -- the common cold -- is getting less attention. While the cold is typically the gentler sickness of the two -- it still allows many to go to work and school, for example, while the flu usually lays people up for a week or more -- it is still a drain on us, both as individuals, and as a wider population.</p>
<p>To protect ourselves from getting a cold or the flu, physical barriers usually rule the day: hand-washing, not sharing cups or water bottles, or staying out of busy public places altogether are strategies that we hear about over and over again.</p>
<p>But what about your diet? Is there anything you can take that will make you less likely to get the cold? And once you're in the clutches of one, is there anything that can make a cold's duration shorter or its symptoms less severe? While there are numerous purported cold remedies on the market, here are the highlights of a few popular nutritional supplements and their possible benefits -- or lack thereof -- in preventing the common cold.</p>
<p>VITAMIN C</p>
<p>When it comes to cold prevention, who doesn't think about popping some vitamin C? After decades of recommendations based largely on the prevention of scurvy, vitamin C made its way into our collective consciousness with two-time Nobel laureate Linus Pauling's assertions that mega-dosing was a pathway to good health. Now, many of us don't think twice about popping several thousand milligrams at a time, and there is a widely held belief that taking vitamin C at the onset of a cold will hold it at bay.</p>
<p>But what does the research say? In 2007, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews -- basically, the granddaddy of evidence-based reviews on medical research -- published an updated review of vitamin C and the common cold, and found that, in a nutshell, yes, taking vitamin C regularly can reduce the length one suffers from a cold -- by eight per cent in adults and 14 per cent in children. But when taken after the onset of symptoms, there was no effect on the length or severity. In other words, megadosing on vitamin C after you feel your first sniffle doesn't seem to do much.</p>
<p>Although most of us may not benefit from taking vitamin C for a cold, there is some evidence that athletes training at a high level (marathon runners, for example), and those exposed to extreme cold temperatures can benefit from popping a few pills.</p>
<p>VITAMIN D</p>
<p>The sunshine vitamin plays a role in immune system function, and according to early evidence, it might help to prevent respiratory tract infections. A study published in the February edition of the journal Archives of Internal Medicine found that people with a lower circulating level of vitamin D had a higher likelihood of developing a respiratory tract infection.</p>
<p>But a more recent study, published in the October issue of Epidemiology and Infection, found that subjects given 2,000 IU of vitamin D over a 12-week period were no less likely to develop a respiratory tract infection. Since there is very limited research on the role vitamin D plays in the development of the common cold, the bottom line is that we don't know enough to be able to do anything but speculate. Having said that, since so many Canadians are vitamin D deficient by late fall or early winter -- the time when cold and flu season hits full stride -- taking a vitamin D supplement probably isn't a bad idea, even if it is for other health benefits than cold prevention.</p>
<p>GARLIC</p>
<p>Long used by numerous cultures for taste and health, garlic's antimicrobial and antiviral properties have earned it a reputation as a classic cold-fighter. But does the evidence agree? According to a Cochrane review published earlier this year, researchers found that there is insufficient evidence to suggest that garlic should be used to prevent or treat the common cold. Bear in mind, though, that the issue was not so much that garlic isn't useful, but rather that there haven't been enough well-controlled trials to allow a clear conclusion to be drawn.</p>
<p>In fact, in one double-blinded trial, subjects given garlic pills containing 180 mg of allicin (the active compound in garlic) for 12 weeks developed only a third as many colds as those given a placebo (dummy pill) for the same amount of time. Since double-blinded, placebo-controlled trials are considered the gold standard for proof, the results would certainly suggest that garlic has a role to play, at least in cold prevention, but more good trials are needed.</p>
<p>ZINC</p>
<p>A known immune-system modulator, there is some research to suggest that zinc can be used to manage respiratory tract infections, pneumonia and the common cold. Zinc supplements might be beneficial for children and the elderly, the data are inconsistent.</p>
<p>Reviewers at Cochrane say the data are inconclusive -- there are several well-controlled trials, and some have demonstrated that zinc lozenges can, in fact, reduce the duration or the severity of the common cold, others have shown no effect.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 distraction for HST</b>
</div><div>Bob Tellier   </div>

</p>
<p>H1N1 is the perfect distraction to the HST. H1N1 affects us now and many of us are scared but if we take the time to practice proper precautions, it will blow over like the other viruses that pass through with very few casualties, hopefully. The same cannot be said about the HST. Once it is here it won't go away and all of us will be affected by it.</p>
<p>Things are bad enough already that we are considering allowing the raising of chickens for food. How much more blood does this government expect us to bleed into their pockets? McGuinty's office was kind enough to send me a generic e-mail and a link that goes nowhere telling me that in 10 years Ontario will start to see the benefits. We don't have 10 years, Mr McGuinty. Many of us don't have 10 months to wait for things to turn around.</p>
<p>I suppose when it all comes crashing down, Dalton will do like all dictators do and that is, pass the blame on to the person who wrote the paper that said things will get better in 10 years. Perhaps the McGuinty dictatorship should find someone to write a paper that shows how they will fix the automotive and manufacturing industries and give us jobs now, not 10 years from now.</p>

<p>Never mind the federal inquiry into B.C.'s vanishing sockeye salmon that will soon be underway. How about an inquiry into the federal government itself?</p>
<p>I'm sure the feds must be good at something. But they're routinely quite hopeless, in ways that would almost be funny if it weren't for the harm being done to Canadians and the country.</p>
<p>How have they hurt us? Let me count the ways.</p>
<p>H1N1. If this had really been "the big one," we'd have been as hooped as a New Orleans hurricane victim waiting for rescue after Katrina. Luckily, we've been allowed to test our national pandemic strategy with a virus that wasn't as terrifying as expected, but picture the shape we'd be in right now had the new flu strain remained as lethal as it was in its early days in Mexico.</p>
<p>Canada has a 550-page pandemic plan, developed by the Public Health Agency four years ago after a botched national response to the SARS crisis. But the Canadian Medical Association Journal warned in September that the plan was neither workable nor in keeping with best medical practices when it came to H1N1.</p>
<p>For starters, the plan around H1N1 was to have Canada's single flu-vaccine supplier produce three different vaccines at the same time, even though the Quebec plant has just one production line. No deep thinking required to see the problem that was bound to create.</p>
<p>The plant was already busy producing seasonal flu vaccine by the time the H1N1 vaccine was developed this fall. So that delayed production of the H1N1 vaccine to the point that two waves of the flu had already swept through most communities by the time vaccinations were underway.</p>
<p>Then the plant had to switch course again when the government ordered 1.8 million doses of "non-adjuvanted" H1N1 vaccine for pregnant women, having grown nervous of the shark-oil derivatives added to the vaccine. That delayed production of the regular H1N1 vaccine a second time.</p>
<p>Nor did the plan take into account human behaviour in times of crisis. The honour system breaks down quickly when people believe their lives are under threat, and who can blame them for thinking that after seven months of hysterical and confusing media coverage?</p>
<p>There's always a way to jump the queue, which is why hockey teams and wealthy Toronto hospital donors have ended up vaccinated while high-risk populations are still lining up.</p>
<p>Why did we choose a single vaccine supplier? The Liberals signed that deal in 2001 with Quebec's <span class="companylink">Shire BioChem,</span> bought by GlaxoKlineSmith in 2005. Coincidentally, Shire BioChem gave a $56,000 donation to the Liberal Party that year.</p>
<p>The gun registry. This sad tale started in 1995 with the passing of a new Firearms Act. The plan required owners to register their weapons and was sold to Canadians as costing taxpayers just $2 million a year. Fourteen lost years and some $2 billion later, Parliament has voted to scrap the registry for all guns other than handguns.</p>
<p>The data on seven million registered "long guns" collected over the years will be thrown away. More than $21 million in registration fees has already been returned to Canadian long-gun owners, with more to come. Your tax dollars at work.</p>
<p>Employment Insurance. Remember when Canadians who were unemployed could actually get benefits to help them through a dry spell?</p>
<p>Back in 1990, 80 per cent of unemployed Canadians qualified for benefits. These days, only 38 per cent do. That's because the federal government has spent more than a decade tightening policies to the point that most out-of-work Canadians no longer qualify.</p>
<p>The denial of benefits has resulted in significant annual surpluses accruing to the federal government for more than 14 years, even while the number of Canadians receiving benefits has plummeted by more than 56 per cent.</p>
<p>Fisheries. The latest concern is a Fraser River sockeye salmon return this fall that was 93 per cent smaller than the Department of Fisheries and Oceans had forecast. The federal government has now launched an inquiry, which is what we do in Canada when we want to douse the flames on a hot issue.</p>
<p>But that's just the latest addition to a long list of alarming examples of fisheries mismanagement in B.C. Federal government policies have decimated fish stocks, weakened monitoring and enhancement and wiped out a thriving community-based industry in order to give the resource away to a handful of wealthy men. It's unforgivable.</p>
<p>I could go on. The sponsorship scandal. The e-health scandal. The isotope fiasco. The fumbling bird flu response. The deeply flawed immigration system.</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw once described democracy as "a device that ensures we shall be governed no better than we deserve." Frightening to think what that says about us.</p>

<p>Federal health officials said Thursday that children between three and nine years of age only require a single half-dose of the H1N1 vaccine. The decision means that parents who have already lined up to have them vaccinated will not have to endure long waits for a second shot. And, it also means a higher percentage of children will be vaccinated sooner.</p>

<p>A review will be conducted into the care given an H1N1-infected Richmond woman who died after twice visiting the outpatient clinic at Richmond Hospital, a Vancouver Coastal Health spokeswoman confirmed yesterday.</p>
<p>Mae Mah, 51, initially went to the hospital on Oct. 31 during an asthma attack. She was treated by doctors and sent home.A day later, Mah was again taken to the hospital suffering shortness of breath and a fever. After seeing a doctor, she was sent home. Later the same day, Mah was taken to the hospital after collapsing at home.</p>
<p>Mah was placed in the intensive-care unit and put on a ventilator. She died a few hours later on Nov. 1 due to cardiac arrest.</p>
<p>Mah's family told CBC-TV they feel the hospital might have been negligent in the death of the chronic asthmatic.</p>
<p>"Deep down, I'm angry and frustrated that this had to happen to my mom," daughter Tiffany Yung, 22, said. "She phoned me and she was joking around with me saying, 'I'm not dead yet,' and: 'I'll see you soon.' "</p>
<p>"But I never saw her again, alive."</p>
<p>Vancouver Coastal Health spokeswoman Anna Marie D'Angelo said a review by doctors, staff and patients will be conducted.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Quad maestro's got his jump back; Says he's in the groove again following suspected bout with H1N1</b>

</p>
<p>Kevin Reynolds, Canadian figure skating's quad maestro, feels like he has some jump back.</p>
<p>The 20-year-old from Coquitlam maintains that a suspected bout of the H1N1 virus at the Cup of China in Beijing a couple of weeks ago stifled his trademark athleticism and leaping ability and led to an eighth-place showing.</p>
<p>He has his second Grand Prix series event this weekend, and said before he left for Skate America in Lake Placid, N.Y. earlier this week that he was looking forward to a chance to put down "two good performances."</p>
<p>"I don't feel like I'm 100 per cent, but I'm getting there," said Reynolds, who trains under Joanne McLeod at the B.C. Centre of Excellence in Burnaby. "Getting sick was frustrating but it could have happened at a worse time.</p>
<p>"I've gotten it over with now and I'm building up my strength again. And I know that my most important competitions are ahead of me.</p>
<p>"It was tough motivation wise in China, but I'm glad that I did it."</p>
<p>Reynolds said that he could feel himself becoming ill in the days leading up to the China trip but figured he could fight it off. In the airport in China, he went through a security gate that picked up his temperature at an elevated level, and soon officials were shuttling him off to hospital.</p>
<p>He was eventually cleared to skate, but he said that his legs felt weak and he had trouble completing his trademark quad jumps.</p>
<p>"My jumps were going very well before the Cup of China," said Reynolds, who never did get confirmation from the doctors in China that he had the H1N1. "I felt like I had a lot of strength. I felt like I had done more training than I had ever done before."</p>
<p>There's more at stake this year, of course. Canada has two spots in the men's division at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics.</p>
<p>Patrick Chan, 18, the reigning world silver medallist from Toronto, is a virtual lock for one. Reynolds, who finished fourth last year at nationals, is in the hunt for the other, along with the likes of the two guys who finished in front of him at the last Canadian championships, Vaughn Chipeur, 24, of Calgary and Jeremy Ten, 20, of Vancouver, respectively.</p>
<p>Shawn Sawyer, 24, of ST. Julie, Que., is also in the mix after placing fifth last year. He joins Reynolds at Lake Placid.</p>
<p>The Canadian figure skating team for February in Vancouver will be announced at the completion of the national championships in London, Ont., on Jan. 17. By rules, the Skate Canada Executive Committee will pick the team, but they'll likely go off the national results.</p>
<p>"A top finish at Skate America would be a big plus, but I really want to make sure that everything works in both my programs," said the 5-foot-9 Reynolds. "I need to be at my best for nationals. It'll be a very tight race at nationals."</p>
<p>American Evan Lysacek, the defending world champion, highlights the men's field in Lake Placid. Korean sensation Yu-Na Kim, who is coached by Canadian legend Brian Orser, leads the women.</p>

<p>Economic activity in Canada is unlikely to suffer a lasting blow from the H1N1 virus, even if it were to reach levels similar to the Spanish flu of 1918, says a study from TD Economics.</p>
<p>The study examines the possible impacts of the H1N1 virus by comparing absentee levels caused by illness and mortality recorded in the other pandemics experienced within the last 100 years in 1918, 1957 and 1968.</p>
<p>"All told," the study says, "a pandemic similar to those experienced in 1957 and 1968 would likely have a fairly limited impact on overall GDP growth.</p>
<p>"A more severe pandemic -- akin to the Spanish flu of 1918 -- would result in a more profound impact on economic activity, but even here the effects should prove to be short-lived," said economist James Marple.</p>
<p>According to Marple's calculations, which consider the impacts of the virus on total economic activity, levels of infection similar to 1957 and 1968 would result in a negative shock to the country's growth, or gross domestic product, of 0.4 to 0.8 percentage points.</p>
<p>"While the prospects for a more severe outbreak of the disease are in our view extremely low, a scenario closer to the experience of 1918 could be expected to have a larger impact on GDP, somewhere in the range of 1.3 to 2.8 per cent," Marple said.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu outbreak of 1918 was the most serious of the three previous pandemics resulting in 50 million deaths, or three per cent of the world's population at the time.</p>

</p>
<p>At this time last year, Casey Smit and his colleagues at <span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms Inc</span>. were looking ahead to spring 2009 as a time of recovery in the hog market.</p>
<p>But when the season of renewal came around, prices for hogs didn't rise. A few months later, when the so-called swine flu hit, prices dropped even lower. In the summertime, said Smit, the company's president and CEO, hogs that were expected to sell 30 to 50 per cent higher than usual didn't hit the mark.</p>
<p>The flu crisis only extended an ongoing downturn in the pork market, he said, forcing the company -- Saskatchewan's largest hog producer -- to file for creditor protection this week, after 24 months of hard times in the hog sector.</p>
<p>"Feed costs had come down, markets were supportive of the hog industry and we were going to see profitable pricing come summer 2009," Smit said Thursday. "When H1N1 hit the news, certainly the impact on the named reference to the swine industry, or to the hog industry, was devastating.</p>
<p>"After it became quite evident that H1N1 did not come from pigs, the damage was already done."</p>
<p>The company's application for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) will give its executives time to meet with advisers and stakeholders and form a restructuring plan, Smit said.</p>
<p>For now, operations will continue as usual for Big Sky's 400 employees working at the company's 40 facilities in Saskatchewan and Manitoba. "Our immediate concern is that our pigs are fed and cared for, our employees . . . are at work and have confidence in the company and we continue to operate," Smit said.</p>
<p>The market troubles that led Big Sky to seek CCAA protection are not just affecting Smit's company, which delivers more than 900,000 animals to North American markets every year -- a figure the CEO still expects to meet in 2009.</p>
<p>"It's the whole hog industry across North America," he said. "It's an industry-wide issue, basically, and it's really based on several factors, with the H1N1 being the latest one."</p>
<p>Smit said higher hog prices would go a long way in assisting the industry right now. Even if a rise in prices doesn't come immediately -- this time of year is typically slower for pork sales -- Smit once again is looking to spring as a time of growth in the market.</p>
<p>"Any pigs that are being produced today for future market needs six months down the road will be sold at a profit, for sure," he said.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan government has a 62 per cent stake in the company and has invested in excess of $30 million in Big Sky during the past several years, said government spokesperson Andrew Dinsmore.</p>
<p>The government has no plans to invest any more dollars into the hog business, Dinsmore added.</p>
<p>Big Sky is based in Humboldt.</p>

<p>One week after complete respiratory failure prompted doctors to put Jaclyn Bates, 27, into a medically induced coma while she battled the H1N1 flu, the Calgary mother of two young children is slowly waking up.</p>
<p>Her fiance, who just days ago was told by health officials to prepare for the chance Bates might die, called it a miracle.</p>
<p>"She's not coherent and she can't respond to commands from the nurses yet, but that's expected," said Rob Pearce, 25. "It's going to be a slow recovery so they are telling me to be patient, but she is slowly waking up."</p>
<p>The fast deterioration of the Calgary mother was shocking, said Pearce.</p>
<p>"She's the epitome of health," Pearce said. "She just went from being perfectly healthy to ridiculously sick in a very short period of time and the doctors aren't even sure why."</p>
<p>Pearce said doctors at Rockyview General Hospital put Bates in an induced coma last Wednesday because she couldn't breathe on her own and doctors wanted to control her lung functions. "She had complete respiratory failure."</p>
<p>His fiancee has slowly improved while in the coma and is starting to breathe on her own again, but remains on a ventilator. Citing privacy laws, a spokesman for Alberta Health Services said Wednesday he couldn't comment on the case.</p>
<p>Though rare, other Canadians have also been put into medically induced comas after being diagnosed with H1N1. Cases include a Nanaimo, B.C., man, 41, who was placed in an induced coma after his kidneys shut down, and a Montreal woman, 23, who died after being put into an induced coma after giving birth to a son in June.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has reported 135 deaths H1N1 nationally.</p>

<p>David Butler-Jones, chief public health officer, defended the national H1N1 vaccination campaign on Thursday, and said the costs of doing nothing would be far higher than the money spent immunizing millions of people.</p>
<p>The Globe and Mail newspaper, citing government medical data, said Canada has so far spent $1.5 billion on the campaign -- more than twice as much as officials initially estimated.</p>
<p>But Butler-Jones said millions of people could become sick and thousands die if there was no program.</p>
<p>So far around 20 per cent of 34 million Canadians have been immunized, and there is no sign the virus has peaked, he said.</p>

</p>
<p>This is just a little reality check. Is H1N1 truly a pandemic, not just statistically but in real terms, or is it paranoia?</p>
<p>In the grand scale of things, is it truly worthy of more than a footnote on history's back page?</p>
<p>Not being a physician skilled in such matters, I can't comment on H1N1's virulence or real danger to the population at large. Maybe it's the plague that the Book of Revelations predicts will kill a third of the world's population, but I don't think so.</p>
<p>Not being a politician, I can't predict how guessing the situation correctly will affect the next election. It could be the catalyst that propels one party to a landslide victory and relegates another to Parliament's dustbin, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>When I note that the last general flu season saw about 64,000 deaths in the U.S. and that H1N1 so far has claimed about 165 lives there, I can only wonder how dangerous H1N1 really is in relative terms.</p>
<p>But what if H1N1 really takes hold and 20 times as many people die? That would indeed be terrible. The death toll would leap to 11,200. That's very bad indeed for these victims and their families.</p>
<p>Statistically, it would then be nearly 18 per cent as bad as last year's flu bug that wasn't bad enough to mention. Quick. Look up. Is that a piece of the sky falling?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Few adverse reactions to vaccine</b>
</div><div>Janet French   </div>
<div>The StarPhoenix</div>
<div>506 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix</div><div>SSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Saskatoon Star Phoenix   </div>
</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region has received nearly 50 reports so far of mild and moderate adverse reactions to the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Dr. Ross Findlater, deputy medical health officer, says the region has received more than 58,000 doses of the vaccine since late October, about 30,000 of which have been shot into arms as of earlier this week. The region is working on a more precise tally of how many shots nurses have administered so far.</p>
<p>The majority of the reactions have been exactly the kinds of problems health professionals expected to see, Findlater says.</p>
<p>"These are mostly pretty mild side-effects," he said.</p>
<p>The side-effects have included symptoms such as swollen arms, muscle pain, fever, headache, weakness and rashes.</p>
<p>Because the H1N1 vaccine is a new immunization, Findlater surmises people are more vigilant about reporting reactions to the shot than for a better-established vaccination.</p>
<p>Compared to the seasonal flu shot, mild reactions appear to be more common with this immunization, Findlater said.</p>
<p>Developing a sore arm seems about twice as common, he says. He's also seeing more headache and muscle pain, but doesn't have any data on how those reactions compare to the seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>Typically, the seasonal flu vaccine causes muscle pain and fatigue in about 10 per cent of patients, he says.</p>
<p>This week, as immunization clinics rolled into many schools, two children had reactions that nurses suspected could be allergic reactions, Findlater said. The children weren't feeling well, but had none of the more severe symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction, such as trouble breathing, or a widespread skin rash. As a precaution, Findlater said both children were given a shot of adrenaline and made short visits to an emergency room before being released. All health region nurses administering the shots have an adrenaline kit with them in case of such an allergic reaction, he said.</p>
<p>Findlater knows of just one other person in the region who went to hospital after receiving the vaccine. A patient was having more weakness than usual, and was told to visit an ER as a precaution. After being checked out, the patient was fine, Findlater said.</p>
<p>Findlater will ultimately review all of the reports of reactions and decide which ones are unusual or noteworthy enough to report to provincial and federal authorities. He said most of the reactions seen so far would not require such reporting.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu facts</b>
</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>643 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>B9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>WHAT IS IT?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>HOW IS IT SPREAD?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>CONTAGIOUSNESS</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>SYMPTOMS</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>TREATMENT</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>VACCINATION</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

</p>
<p>Question: Can you get the H1N1 virus more than once? How do you disinfect your house after someone has had it?</p>
<p>Answer: Generally speaking, someone who has had influenza will develop immunity to it so it's not likely that a person would be infected with the identical influenza virus more than once. People with weakened immune systems might not develop full immunity after infection and may be more likely to get infected with the same influenza virus more than once. The only way to know what was causing illness would be to have a lab test. Because of this, public health officials are recommending that everyone receive the vaccine. There are no adverse effects for someone who has had H1N1 infection to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>If you've had a case of flu in your home, remember that flu viruses can live two to eight hours on surfaces. While looking after someone who is ill, be sure to dispose of contaminated materials, such as tissues, immediately and wash your hands with soap and water often. Frequently touched surfaces should be cleaned often using a regular household cleaner. After recovery, hard surfaces should be cleaned again. Soft surfaces such as bedding or stuffed animals should be cleaned by a single run through the washer and dryer. Your hands should be washed with soap and water after handling these items.</p>

<p>With hand sanitizer flying off shelves and people forgoing large crowds to avoid catching swine flu, for many, basic hygiene seems to take a vacation when on holiday.</p>
<p>Take, for example, Ireland's Blarney Stone. Why would anyone in their right mind kiss the same stone surface that the lips of almost half a million people have touched that year alone? Maybe it's the Guinness.</p>
<p>On a positive note, according last summer's poll of more than 4,600 travellers on tripadvisor.com, 34 per cent of travellers reported being more "germaphobic" by washing and disinfecting their hands more frequently when travelling since the swine flu outbreak. Additionally, TripAdvisor forums indicate that travellers have got germs on the brain, with use of the words "germs," "sanitizer," and "disease" up 97 per cent, 182 per cent, and 112 per cent, respectively. The poll looked at results between March and May of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.</p>
<p>Here are what TripAdvisor's editors and readers thought were the top five germiest world attractions.</p>
<p>- Kiss me, I'm filthy: Blarney Stone, Blarney, Ireland</p>
<p>Legend says that those who kiss the Blarney Stone, a block of stone built into Ireland's Blarney Castle, are rewarded with eloquent speech. But given that up to 400,000 mouths from all over the world touch the stone each year, putting your own to the grimy attraction -- no easy task in itself -- may be too high a price for the promised "gift of gab." One TripAdvisor traveller commented, "(You) have to bend over backwards, and kiss the stone upside down -- imagine the germs on the stone from everyone doing that!"</p>
<p>- Sticky situation: Wall of Gum, Seattle, Wash.</p>
<p>A bizarre tradition at Seattle's Market Theatre in Post Alley has turned into a fascinating yet very germy attraction: a giant wall of gum. In the 1990s, visitors began sticking their gum to the wall while waiting in line, resulting in a colourful and somewhat stomach-turning sight after more than a decade of gum gathering. Some intrepid visitors have even moulded shapes and faces out of their masticated gum. One TripAdvisor traveller reminds us, "Don't forget to contribute to the gum wall!"</p>
<p>- Lip reading: Oscar Wilde's Tomb, Paris, France</p>
<p>It is a testament to the love and respect felt by book-lovers and admirers the world over -- Oscar Wilde's tomb in Paris' Pere-Lachaise cemetery is famously covered in lipstick prints. But with a rainbow of hundreds of visible kiss marks adorning the grave, and countless more planted every year, one can't help but wonder ... isn't there a cleaner way to show your literary appreciation? One TripAdvisor traveller said, "The tombstone of Oscar Wilde is ... well, wild, excuse the pun."</p>
<p>- Foul fowl: St. Mark's Square, Venice, Italy</p>
<p>A place of immeasurable beauty, Venice's famed St. Mark's Square has a dirty side: its thousands of hungry pigeons. While vendors no longer sell food to tourists to give to the birds, they still flock in countless numbers, with many visitors choosing to touch and even hold the pigeons. Be careful, these dirty fowl have been known to leave foul unexpected gifts on tourists. One TripAdvisor traveller recalls, "I know it does seem a little bit disgusting, but it's so totally hilarious to see your friend/partner/dad being attacked by birds!"</p>
<p>- Grubby mitts: Forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theater (Handprints and Footprints), Hollywood, California</p>
<p>The forecourt to this historical Hollywood landmark features the hand and footprints of some of the biggest stars in history. But this intimate look at Hollywood's hands can get a bit grimy given that millions of fans place their fingers in the moulds of their favourites. You may think about bringing some gloves or hand sanitizer before comparing your own paws to those of the greats. One TripAdvisor traveller said, "You couldn't help comparing your feet and hands, too (with those of the stars)."</p>

<p>Much – some will say far too much – has been written and said about H1N1 influenza and how well public-health officials have responded to the threat.</p>
<p>But there is one element of the response to this public-health challenge that has been largely, if not totally, ignored: the profoundly disturbing undercurrent of ageism.</p>
<p>As proud veterans – so many of them now frail and elderly – stood yesterday in Remembrance Day ceremonies, one could not be awed by their sacrifice and their stoicism.</p>
<p>At the same time, one could not help but be sickened by this thought: These aging warriors and their contemporaries are virtually the last in line for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Does this not fly in the face of all the grandiose talk of respect? Sure, we honour our soldiers by sporting poppies, but should we not also honour them otherwise, with first-rate health care?</p>
<p>In addition to laying wreaths in remembrance of the dead, should we not be fanning out to veterans' hospitals, long-term care facilities, nursing homes and Canadian Legion halls with H1N1 vaccines for the living?</p>
<p>“Lest we forget.” Those words were uttered countless times yesterday.</p>
<p>We vaccinated current soldiers en masse, along with their Taliban prisoners; per capita, the Department of National Defence has received far more vaccine than any province or territory.</p>
<p>Why have we forgotten the veterans?</p>
<p>Lest we not forget that, in the past century – a century marked by two world wars and countless other bloody conflicts – influenza has killed far more people than all wars combined.</p>
<p>Those hit first were all too often soldiers; infectious diseases thrive in chaotic, unsanitary conditions. In peacetime, it is children who get the flu first and spread it efficiently, but it is predominantly seniors who get sick and die in large numbers.</p>
<p>Soldiers who returned home after the First World War not only survived the trenches, but the greatest plague in history. The Spanish flu, in a mere 24 weeks, claimed somewhere between 20 million and 50 million lives.</p>
<p>Those who came home alive from the Second World War endured a pseudo-pandemic in 1947 that is similar to the one today – a big potential threat that caused very little death. (There were also influenza pandemics in 1957 and 1968, and a pseudo-pandemic in 1976.)</p>
<p>Public-health officials tell us that relegating older people to the bottom of the priority is not ageism but good science.</p>
<p>But all evidence requires an element of interpretation and all public policies involve tough choices.</p>
<p>There are data that suggest that older people – those born prior to 1957 – have some immunity to H1N1 because most of the flu strains that circulated between 1918 and 1957 were of the H1N1 variety, cousins to the current pandemic strain.</p>
<p>Practically, this means that older people have a lesser risk of contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>But the cold, hard data on hospitalizations and deaths also tell us that, when seniors contract H1N1, they have the highest rate of hospitalization and death.</p>
<p>Yet, we hear incessantly that this pandemic strain of influenza is a public-health priority because of the risk it poses to children and young adults. In these groups, flu deaths are normally very rare and now they are merely rare.</p>
<p>The unspoken but implied calculus here is that the death of a senior is less of a tragedy than the death of a child or an adult in the “prime” of his or her life.</p>
<p>We see this attitude in our influenza policies writ large. Governments and public-health authorities have pulled out all the stops in response to H1N1. This may or may not be appropriate.</p>
<p>What is unquestionable is that we pay far too little attention to seasonal flu, the run-of-the-mill disease that comes round each winter, strikes down 4,000 to 8,000 people and results in the hospitalization of tens of thousands more.</p>
<p>Let's be frank: We treat this recurring public-health disaster with casual indifference because deaths and severe illness occur almost exclusively in older people.</p>
<p>When nursing homes are being decimated by influenza, when thousands of grandmas and grandpas are hospitalized with “regular” life-threatening flu, we don't see almost daily press conferences by the Minister of Health, full-page newspaper ads urging vaccination, unprecedented mobilization of public health and hysteria.</p>
<p>We see a collective shrug of the shoulders.</p>
<p>It is a stark reminder that our elders are all too often relegated to the back of the health-care bus. And nowhere is that more true than among aging veterans.</p>
<p>But you didn't see hobbled veterans and their contemporaries rolling up in their wheelchairs and wielding their canes to butt into the vaccine queues. Rather, we saw the young wealthy and healthy – millionaire hockey players and hospital donors – exercise a self-important sense of entitlement.</p>
<p>Haven't we already asked our veterans to sacrifice their health for others quite enough?</p>
<p>There are 10.5 million doses of H1N1 out there across Canada. Let's get some of them into seniors and to veterans in particular. And just as important, let's ramp up the seasonal flu vaccination campaigns to protect seniors from a big threat lurking around the corner.</p>
<p>Lest we forget who the flu really kills.</p>
<p>CORRECTION</p>
<p>Thursday, November 19, 2009</p>
<p>Last week's column about the need to vaccinate seniors against H1N1 was supposed to include the sentence: “As proud veterans – so many of them now frail and elderly – stood yesterday in Remembrance Day ceremonies, one could not but be awed by their sacrifice and their stoicism.” But the word “but” was omitted, making me look like, well, a butt. My apologies.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Police brass join list of queue jumpers; 'Business continuity' plan meant top officers were given the jab, even as vaccine supplies dwindled</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle AND ROBYN DOOLITTLE   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>633 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT02</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>A Nov. 12 headline stating that "Police brass join list of queue jumpers" was incorrect. In fact, Toronto police did not jump the queue to receive the vaccine. As the article correctly says, some Toronto police officials, including Chief Bill Blair, were given the shots according to a pandemic flu plan to inoculate "key decision makers." The day after police received the flu shots, Toronto health officials decided to stop inoculating police due to a shortage of the vaccine. 20091114</p>
<p>Police brass, including Toronto Chief Bill Blair, were given the flu shot almost two weeks ago even though they were not on the province's priority list.</p>
<p>Toronto Police Services spokesperson Mark Pugash said Wednesday that it was part of the force's "business continuity" plan to have "key decision makers" vaccinated.</p>
<p>Blair and the rest of the force's command were given the shots on Oct. 30. Hours later, Toronto Public Health officials decided to stop inoculating police because they had learned there was a shortage of the vaccine, said Anne Marie Aikins, spokeswoman for the health unit.</p>
<p>"It has always been part of our pandemic flu plan to include first responders during mass vaccination," she said.</p>
<p>"Keep in mind public health units had to plan our vaccination strategy before we got official direction from the province as to when we were getting the vaccine, how much we were getting and who would be included as part of the priority groups. This information didn't come until just prior to rolling out the strategy. And no one knew we were going to have a shortage of vaccine until late on the 30th," she added.</p>
<p>It wasn't until Tuesday that first responders to emergencies, such as police, were added to the province's priority list. Chief Medical Officer of Health Dr. Arlene King told reporters that day it was possible the odd police officer received an early vaccine, but she said that would have occurred only if the officer worked on medical calls and had a greater chance of being exposed to H1N1.</p>
<p>This latest revelation seemed to add even more confusion to the vaccine rollout, which has been plagued with queue jumping by professional athletes, hospital board members and private schools.</p>
<p>The vaccine is still in production and until there is enough for the entire population, federal and provincial public health officials are rationing it to priority groups only. These groups include health-care workers and people at greater risk of suffering serious complications and even death from the virus. That includes people with underlying health problems, pregnant women and young children.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, front-line police officers, firefighters, correctional staff and people aged 65 and over who live in long-term institutions were added to the priority list.</p>
<p>The president of a union that represents hospital workers expressed outrage over cases of queue jumping, calling it a "free-for-all."</p>
<p>"There have been no checks and balances. There has been no accountability," said Sharleen Stewart, president of SEIU Local 1.</p>
<p>Stewart said a home-care worker and union member is now in a coma at London Health Sciences Centre after contracting H1N1. The woman was not given access to the vaccine in time, charges the union, adding that workers in the home-care sector were initially denied the vaccine in many cases.</p>
<p>"Scarce supplies have gone to the wrong groups," Stewart charged. "In the first few days, front-line health workers showed admirable patience and bravery by not pushing to the fore. Then they watched as sports teams, hospital board members and elite schools got preferential treatment."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Olympics, infrastructure spending to spur recovery; Conference Board says every province will see growth next year except Newfoundland and Labrador</b>
</div><div>Virginia Galt  </div>

</p>
<p>The Winter Olympics will boost British Columbia's economy in 2010, infrastructure spending will play a large role in Ontario's recovery, oil sands development will bolster Alberta's growth and a rebound in potash production will pull Saskatchewan out of the recession, the Conference Board of Canada said Thursday.</p>
<p>“Although the recovery is still fragile, weaknesses will dissipate in the next few months, and all provincial economies with the exception of Newfoundland and Labrador are expected to grow in 2010,” Marie-Christine Bernard, the Conference Board's associate director responsible for provincial outlooks, said in a report Thursday.</p>
<p>British Columbia will “top the podium” in 2010, buoyed by the Olympics and a rebound in the forestry sector, the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>Here's the coast-to-coast breakdown:</p>
<p>British Columbia: GDP expected to grow by 4.2 per cent in 2010</p>
<p>“The global recession hit British Columbia hard, but the worst is over,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“Real gross domestic product is forecast to grow by 4.2 per cent in 2010. due to a comeback in the construction sector, recoveries in forest and manufacturing and hosting the Winter Olympic Games.”</p>
<p>Alberta: Oil sands activity up, economy to grow by 3 per cent</p>
<p>“Alberta's economy suffered badly during the recession, but higher oil prices will spur oil sands development in 2010, benefiting the manufacturing and services sectors,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“After declining by 2.6 per cent in 2009, Alberta's real GDP is forecast to grow by 3 per cent next year.”</p>
<p>Saskatchewan: Potash will push growth to 3.7 per cent</p>
<p>“Potash production in Saskatchewan is down by almost 65 per cent since the start of the year, leading to a decline of 2.6 per cent in real GDP [in 2009],” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“But potash production is expected to rebound next year, and the Saskatchewan economy is forecast to grow by 3.7 per cent in 2010.”</p>
<p>Manitoba: Growth of 2.5 per cent expected, but ‘swine flu' fears have hurt pork production</p>
<p>“Thanks to strong growth in construction and strength in some service industries, the Manitoba economy has remained in positive territory,” the Conference Board said. However, the rising Canadian dollar and falling hog prices “due to fears related to the H1N1 “swine flu' pandemic are crippling the hog industry.”</p>
<p>A strong increase in the finance, insurance, and real estate sectors – along with renewed growth in manufacturing – will grow the economy by 2.5 per cent next year.</p>
<p>Ontario: GDP to grow by 3.2 per cent, boosted by infrastructure spending</p>
<p>“As the barrage of losses in a number of key industries subsides, Ontario can look forward to more normal economic conditions,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“Public infrastructure spending is playing a large role in the recovery. After contracting in 2008 and 2009, real GDP is forecast to grow by 3.2 per cent in 2010.”</p>
<p>Quebec: Gold and electricity projects will help generate growth of 2.4 per cent</p>
<p>“Quebec was hit hard by the global recession – although not as badly as were Ontario and the Western provinces,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“In 2010, improving labour markets and strong non-residential investment in gold mining projects and electricity-generating capacity will help produce growth of 2.4 per cent.”</p>
<p>New Brunswick: Infrastructure spending, forestry rebound will contribute to growth of 2 per cent</p>
<p>“Amid growing fears that the province was slipping into recession, the provincial government announced a bold economic rescue plan – a $1.2-billion infrastructure package and $402-million in tax cuts over the next two years. The measures have helped the economy avert recession and brightened the prospects for next year,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>In addition to the government's stimulus spending, a recovering United States housing market should increase demand for wood products. The economy is expected to grow by 2 per cent next year.</p>
<p>Nova Scotia: Growth forecast at 1.9 per cent, boosted by infrastructure spending</p>
<p>“The outlook in Nova Scotia, in particular the industrial sector, will also benefit from the turnaround south of the border,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“Combined with continued public stimulus spending, the province is expected to advance by 1.9 per cent in 2010 after a gain of 0.4 per cent in 2009.”</p>
<p>Prince Edward Island: Recession averted, but growth will be a modest 1.8 per cent</p>
<p>“Government stimulus is one of the principal reasons why the economy has not fallen into recession?A new five-year $510-million capital spending program will advance public non-residential investment at blistering rates through the rest of this year and 2010,” The Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“Growth will accelerate slightly to 1.8 per cent in 2010, as global demand strengthens and trade shocks dissipate.”</p>
<p>Newfoundland and Labrador: Won't see growth until 2011</p>
<p>“Offshore oil fields have passed peak production, workers at the Voisey's Bay nickel mine have been on strike since August, and permanently lower demand for newsprint has devastated pulp and paper mills,” the Conference Board said.</p>
<p>“Declining offshore oil production and weaker construction activity over the year will prevent a recovery.” The province's GDP is expected to decline by 0.5 per cent in 2010.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Doctors should be cautious about giving Tamiflu to people to prevent them from becoming ill after they've been exposed to H1N1, an antiviral expert said Wednesday as he reported details of North America's first reported case of Tamiflu-resistant H1N1 viruses.</p>
<p>Dr. Guy Boivin said people who've been exposed to the virus may already be in the process of becoming ill, a circumstance that can foster the emergence of Tamiflu-resistant viruses.</p>
<p>As of late last week the World Health Organization was reporting that 42 cases of Tamiflu-resistant pandemic H1N1 viruses had been seen globally since the pandemic began. The case Boivin reported on in the New England Journal of Medicine was the third, from late June.</p>
<p>"I have to admit I would have expected more cases, considering . . . the large volume of Tamiflu that has been used in the last few months, certainly more than in the last five years, probably," said Boivin, who is based at Laval University in Quebec City.</p>
<p>"But I'm still concerned that the same situation that has occurred with the seasonal H1N1 could be . . . repeated with the pandemic H1N1."</p>
<p>Seasonal H1N1 viruses developed resistance to Tamiflu a couple of years ago for reasons that remain unclear.</p>
<p>Though it had previously been thought that the mutation needed to confer resistance to the drug would cripple any resistant viruses that emerged, that proved not to be the case. The resistant viruses spread like wildfire, virtually crowding out susceptible seasonal H1N1 viruses and rendering Tamiflu useless against them. If that happened with seasonal H1N1 viruses, it could happen with the pandemic virus.</p>

<p>Why should anyone be surprised to see professional athletes getting preferential treatment when it comes to medical care - in this case, jumping the queue for the H1N1 vaccination?</p>
<p>Sport today is big business, involving multi-million-dollar contracts and huge profits. When an athlete suffers an injury, such as a torn knee ligament, they get immediate diagnosis and treatment, including surgery (often the very next day). Personally, I had to wait over four months just for an MRI to diagnose a torn meniscus (cartilage) after injuring my knee.</p>
<p>At least the Toronto Maple Leafs will not be able to blame the swine flu for their dismal performance thus far this season.</p>

<p>From all the negativity I've read about lately I'm surprised there isn't rioting in the streets. You mean there may be long lineups in the face of vaccinating the entire country? Who would have thought? Sure there are going to be speed bumps along the way, hence the wristband policy.</p>
<p>From my viewpoint, there are many people doing all they can during this pandemic and they deserve some support.</p>
<p>I thought it commendable that the vaccine was made available for this flu season, seeing how new this H1N1 virus is. In the past such technology didn't even exist.</p>
<p>Some people think they deserve so much and have trouble realizing how good they have it. I am sure this pandemic will ravage Third World countries.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Despite health officials imploring people to let high-risk groups get their H1N1 shots first and stressing most cases of H1N1 flu are mild, more and more reports are surfacing of people jumping the queue to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Hockey players in both the major and minor leagues, numerous hospital board members in Ontario and Quebec, and students and staff at some private colleges in Ontario have had their shot. It remains unclear how many of those recipients fell into a high-risk category.</p>
<p>There have also been stories of people who don't fall into any of the priority groups joining the long lineups at public clinics.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the majority of jurisdictions still haven't set a hard date for when the general public can expect to get inoculated.</p>
<p>At least one expert says this queue-jumping behaviour just might be people's survival instinct kicking in. Several factors may be prompting "me first" behaviour, said Scott Schieman, a sociology professor at the University of Toronto.</p>
<p>While he couldn't comment on specific cases, Schieman, who is also deputy editor at the American Sociological Association's Journal of Health and Social Behaviour, said the will to survive might trump all.</p>
<p>"Part of it probably has to do with just levels of anxiety reaching a certain point where some people sort of feel survival takes priority," Schieman said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>"Social norms that typically would provide order and a sense of fairness and help people keep a sense of calm get tossed aside by some, and that can really result in, and even make worse, a panic mentality."</p>

<p>On Nov. 5, my husband and I went to the public health clinic at College Avenue School. My husband, who is over 65, was turned away because they did not consider him to be a "high risk."</p>
<p>Let me explain why I disagree. He has lymphoma (obtained after 29 years of firefighting service), renal failure, a heart condition, prostate cancer, and lung problems with shortness of breath. As well, he is immune suppressed and has received chemotherapy. If he were to get the H1N1 flu, he would not have any resistance to fight it off.</p>
<p>As for me, I'm his caregiver, and if I were to get ill who would look after him?</p>
<p>What does public health consider "high risk"? Something is very wrong with the nurses' screening.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The Guelph General Hospital is reminding diagnostic technicians to sanitize their machines between patients after a complaint.</p>
<p>Morriston resident Bill Kerr, a heavy equipment operator, said the incident occurred Thursday afternoon when he came to the hospital for an X-ray of his face.</p>
<p>When the previous patient left, he stepped into the X-ray room and positioned his face, as directed by a technician, against what is called "an upright bucky," a detector that produces an image. The technician commended him on doing so much better than the previous patient.</p>
<p>In an era of pandemic H1N1 flu, Kerr said he became alarmed because there didn't appear time for the technician to disinfect the area around where his face was resting. He was concerned, he said, because he was in contact with the same surface as the previous patient.</p>
<p>"I said: ‘Did you wipe this down?' She said: ‘No, we're not in the habit of doing that,'" Kerr said.</p>
<p>"I said: What? I don't believe this. In this day of H1N1?</p>
<p>"I said I'm not going to let this go. This is crazy, man." Kerr said he informed administration that afternoon, concerned about possible spread of germs between patients in such close quarters.</p>
<p>"I'm appalled at this," Kerr said of the situation he encountered in the X-ray room.</p>
<p>He reasoned as much as hospital front-line workers take precautions like wearing gloves and masks against contagious bugs, so too must steps be taken so patients don't spread germs when they're in close contact with each other.</p>
<p>The hospital reported Wednesday technicians are being reminded it is a protocol - a standard procedure - to use a sanitizer to wipe imaging surfaces after each patient.</p>
<p>"We have routine infection control practices," Mike Sharma, the hospital's director of diagnostic imaging, said Wednesday after speaking to Kerr about his concerns the day before.</p>
<p>But while these control measures were once the focus of patients held in isolation to prevent spread of illness, it's now a precautionary practice for all, Sharma said.</p>
<p>That's being emphasized with staff.</p>
<p>"It gives us the opportunity to reinforce we do it for all patients," Sharma said. "It was a learning experience."</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 flu shots are expected to be available to everyone but healthy adults starting tomorrow.</p>
<p>School-age children and seniors with chronic conditions should be added tomorrow to the province's list of people who can get the shot, say Hamilton and Halton public health officials. They're preparing for an influx of demand, including Hamilton's first weekend flu shot clinic Saturday at Jackson Square from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Halton is re-opening its clinics today after getting a new shipment of vaccine this week. Medical officer of health Dr. Bob Nosal expects Halton to have enough doses to make it through clinics running from today until Sunday.</p>
<p>"The clinics could be very, very busy," he said. "We're geared up to go. Unfortunately, supply is still an issue for the next week."</p>
<p>He says it will likely be the end of November or early December before healthy adults can get the vaccine. H1N1 is expected to be far less of a threat by then. It appears to have peaked in Hamilton and Halton, which are both flu hot spots in the province.</p>
<p>The number of people in Hamilton and Halton with flu-like symptoms who test positive for H1N1 dropped to 34 per cent last week from 48 per cent the week before.</p>
<p>Hamilton associate medical officer of health Dr. Chris Mackie cautioned that is still much higher than the 20 to 25 per cent normally seen at the peak of a regular flu season. "It's still higher than we've ever recorded before H1N1," he said.</p>
<p>And new outbreaks are still being reported. Hamilton General had at least three patients on one unit test positive this week for H1N1. St. Joseph's has had three outbreaks.</p>
<p>But the number of sick in schools and emergency departments is dropping.</p>
<p>The percentage of Halton schools with more than 2 per cent of students absent with influenza-like illness is now down to 40 per cent from a high of 60 to 70 per cent.</p>
<p>And the number of people with flu symptoms going to emergency departments in Halton has dropped to below 30 per cent of visits from a high of 45 per cent.</p>
<p>Both Mackie and Nosal say it's still worth getting the H1N1 shot despite the decline of virus cases.</p>
<p>"Although we're past the peak, there is still a lot of activity," said Nosal. "Flu is going to be with us for the next several weeks if not months."</p>
<p>However, a minority of infectious disease experts think there isn't any need to vaccinate the general public.</p>
<p>"I don't think telling anyone and everyone that they must get it post-peak is really sensible," said Dr. Neil Rau, an Oakville infectious disease specialist. "We don't immunize people just because we can. We do it because we're expecting a benefit. When you vaccinate people when there's not much expected benefit, you're doing it just because you can."</p>
<p>One woman died in Halton from H1N1.</p>
<p>It's unknown how many deaths Hamilton has had because Mackie refused to provide updated numbers yesterday. There were eight deaths as of last week, but Mackie says he won't tell the public how many more died since then until tomorrow.</p>
<p>HAMILTON AND AREA FLU SHOT CLINICS</p>

</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus has meant more absences than normal at the Lester B. Pearson School Board this fall - but nothing crazy that has seriously impeded the school year.</p>
<p>Board-wide absenteeism has been holding steady at about 10 per cent for the last couple of weeks. There was a bit of a spike on Friday and a slight dip on Monday, but no seriously alarming absentee rates.</p>
<p>Daniela Scoppa, communications officer for the board, said when the board began compiling the absentee rates on Oct. 15, the rate was only 0.4 per cent. Since then, however, it has been holding pretty steady at about 10 per cent.</p>
<p>"We are coping with it," she said.</p>
<p>There have been about 1,000 students a day at home with flu-like symptoms, according to Pearson chairperson Marcus Tabachnick.</p>
<p>"There's no question that's higher than normal," he said in an interview this week.</p>
<p>Another 1,200 to 1,500 students are also away from school every day for a variety of reasons.</p>
<p>Tabachnick said the school board has left it to individual school to decide whether or not they want to use hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>"Whatever works in their own community is best," he said.</p>
<p>Principals and school staff throughout the board are continuing to remind parents to keep sick children home, to send home any student or staff member displaying flu-like symptoms, to remind students to frequently wash their hands and to avoid sharing food and personal items and to be extra vigilant when cleaning.</p>

<p>York regional police are investigating how a tony private school north of Toronto was able to give the H1N1 vaccine to all its students, not just the ones who belong to a high-risk priority group. Officials at St. Andrew's College, an all-boys boarding and day school, refused to comment on the allegations saying that they "had followed due process." The school said that it had applied to receive the vaccine from York health officials and was approved because it has students from 25 countries. But a health authority spokesperson refuted the claim.</p>

</p>
<p>Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc took heavy fire on multiple fronts yesterday, after he singled out nurses for possible firing if they are involved in H1N1 vaccination queue-jumping.</p>
<p>Angered by what it described as "contemptuous" and "scornful" remarks by Bolduc about front-line nurses often working 12-hour shifts at vaccination clinics, Quebec's largest nursing union demanded a formal apology.</p>
<p>Bolduc showed "an enormous lack of respect for the caregivers," added Régine Laurent, president of the Fédération Interprofessionelle de la Santé du Québec, representing 45,000 of the province's 64,000 nurses.</p>
<p>Parti Québecois leader Pauline Marois called Bolduc's approach "unacceptable" in the National Assembly, after the minister Tuesday threatened serious sanctions "if today we learned that a nurse allowed someone she knows by the back door" for inoculation.</p>
<p>Examples of line-jumping include volunteer-donors and board members at the Jewish General Hospital, and Quebec singer Claude Dubois.</p>
<p>"There have been errors in judgment (recently)," Bolduc said, "but, as of right now, anybody who permits queue-jumping will be evaluated," with punishment that could include dismissal.</p>
<p>Dr. Alain Poirier, Quebec's public health director, lauded nurses for their extraordinary work during the outbreak: "Nurses are our stars ... without them we couldn't do anything."</p>
<p>Bolduc hasn't singled out any other professional group for criticism, Laurent said.</p>
<p>"This is not an example of leadership by the minister," she declared. "In fact, it is the opposite."</p>

</p>
<p>The Montreal Health and Social Services Agency is looking at the option of busing thousands of children to vaccination centres to accelerate the immunization program and make the process easier on parents.</p>
<p>In the Montérégie area, busing is expected to start Nov. 23. For the Montreal region, discussions have begun between the agency, school boards and the Public Safety Department on the possibility of following suit.</p>
<p>Agency head David Levine did not attend yesterday's H1N1 media briefing at the agency's headquarters on St. Denis St.</p>
<p>He was home sick with a mild case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Health officials said at least 50 per cent of those in the high-risk group - the severely ill, families with babies, pregnant women and front-line health workers - have already been vaccinated.</p>
<p>About 23,000 people are being vaccinated every day.</p>
<p>But the 811 Info-Santé help line is overwhelmed; expect to wait 45 minutes for a nurse to answer your call.</p>
<p>The health agency also said that in anticipation of higher infection rates, Montreal will become the nerve centre regarding demands from rural regions for intensive care beds.</p>
<p>About 200 Montreal hospital patients who do not need acute care are to be transferred to nursing homes.</p>
<p>That also means a temporary embargo on new admissions to long-term-care residences.</p>
<p>The agency says eight long-term residences have reported an outbreak of H1N1.</p>
<p>Seniors groups maintain that Quebec has ignored World Health Organization recommendations for vaccinating seniors as a risk group.</p>
<p>Vaccine shortages limited the inoculation schedule, Terry-Nan Tannenbaum of the agency's department of public health said yesterday.</p>
<p>"But everyone will be vaccinated," Tannenbaum said. She referred to Alain Poirier, Quebec's chief public health officer, who said this week that the vaccine sequence was established according to population data.</p>
<p>Quebec is reporting a total of 20 deaths from swine flu complications since Aug. 30, three of them in the last 48 hours. All had underlying health issues.</p>
<p>Montreal has a total of 749 cases of swine flu, which include 78 hospitalizations, of which two were in the last 48 hours.</p>
<p>Four Montrealers have died of H1N1 complications since Aug. 30.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Support groups feel the pinch; Non-H1N1 activities cancelled: Teenagers who need counselling are being punished, mother says</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>621 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>With a spike in swine flu infections, the Quebec Health Department has cancelled most non-H1N1-related activities across the province so the government can throw all its resources at pandemic preparedness.</p>
<p>A blanket directive from Jacques Cotton, Quebec's deputy health minister, issued last week tells hospitals to put on hold or postpone non-urgent administrative activities, including committee and department meetings that are not linked to swine flu.</p>
<p>This "délestage," or rerouting, also means that some government support groups - including suicide prevention for adolescents - have been cancelled for a minimum of six weeks, once the H1N1 wave is expected to have peaked.</p>
<p>For Emilie and Jeremy Noël, whose father committed suicide last year, the move is incomprehensible.</p>
<p>Several teens in their 11-member support group in Laval will go though rough times during this period, said Jeremy, 15. Some will have to face the anniversary of a parent's death, or their own birthday - moments when such support is particularly important - without the group.</p>
<p>"These are the only people who truly understand what we are going through," said Emilie, 13.</p>
<p>The support groups were cancelled to prevent the spread of H1N1 and "to make better use of resources," said Jeremy, quoting from a letter issued by the Laval health board.</p>
<p>The children are being punished, said Peggy Verhoef, the mother of Jeremy and Emilie. "My kids were making excellent progress, and now they will have to start all over again."</p>
<p>Health Department spokesperson Dominique Breton said more information on support-group cancellation will be available today.</p>
<p>In Montreal, health agency spokesperson Deborah Bonney couldn't say which non-pandemic-related activities were dropped, but mentioned prenatal care as a possibility.</p>
<p>The agency refused to provide further details.</p>
<p>Jean Rodrigue, medical director of the Montérégie Health and Social Services Agency, said several meetings at his agency were postponed.</p>
<p>A specialists' round table and a family doctors' committee meeting, originally set for November, were rescheduled for January, he said.</p>
<p>"We prefer cancelling so they can look after patients," Rodrigue said. "Many meetings can be postponed for two to three months without much impact."</p>
<p>But perhaps hospital services should be reorganized, he suggested, given that the Montérégie area is one of the hardest hit by the virus, with 270 hospitalized with H1N1.</p>
<p>"As the number (of flu cases) increases in hospitals, should we continue regular activity or should we postpone elective surgery? We are looking at how that will translate, establishment by establishment," he said.</p>
<p>At Quebec's National Public Health Institute, a public health body, regular activities had to be postponed as people directed their energies at coping with H1N1, director general Luc Boileau said. "But patients are not at risk," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>The response to the opening of the first H1N1 flu vaccine centre in the West Island at the former Allancroft School was so overwhelming, hundreds had to be turned away causing some confusion and anger from those told to they could not be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The Allancroft vaccination centre was opened two days before the Nov. 6 date indicated on a pamphlet widely distributed to homes throughout the Montreal area to vaccinate frontline health-care workers. The next day at the request of the Agence de la santé et des service sociaux de Montreal, Allancroft opened at noon so that women more than 20 weeks pregnant, families of children six months or younger, children between six months and five years, plus people with immunosupression issues and their families could be vaccinated.</p>
<p>Going on the information from the pamphlet that indicated a Friday, Nov. 6, opening, more than 1,000 people as well as those turned away Thursday, showed up creating a massive lineup.</p>
<p>William Binette, who suffers from Crohn's disease, was in line for hours with his mother, Geneviève, before discovering they could not be vaccinated.</p>
<p>"It seems he is not a priority," she said, after being told only those with chronic illnesses were eligible. "The hospital said he should be vaccinated."</p>
<p>Shelly Reddan and her husband Stephano were told the same thing after spending two and a half hours in line.</p>
<p>"My wife has had two heart attacks and half of her spleen taken out, yet they refused us. It's cruel," he said.</p>
<p>After a heated discussion with a health-care worker, those with immunosuppression diseases were finally allowed inside to be vaccinated.</p>
<p>The combination of those turned away Thursday and the hundreds that showed up Friday to be vaccinated put a strain on health-care personnel, security officials and the surrounding community. Police were on hand as parking was at a premium. Cars parked in front of hydrants, cars on both sides of narrow suburban streets and even at the bottom of local residents' driveways added to the chaos.</p>
<p>By Monday police and Beaconsfield public security had put up roads signs re-configuring the direction of two key streets near Allancroft School.</p>
<p>Louis-Pascal Cyr, assistant to the executive director of the Centre de santé et des services sociaux de l'Ouest-de-I'Île, admitted that the pamphlet distributed by the regional health officials was misleading inasmuch as new directives had come that changed the overall agenda for vaccination categories.</p>
<p>"But we always try to make sure people are treated in a caring way," he said.</p>
<p>He defended the coupon system being sued at the vaccination sites saying it minimized the time people had to spend in line.</p>
<p>"This is an operation of unprecedented magnitude. We have to be able to change and adapt."</p>
<p>By Tuesday, the Allancroft site had vaccinated 7,500 people, Cyr said.</p>

<div>Q: Queries - Quibbles - Quirks</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Inoculation program deserves shot in the arm</b>
</div><div>Dr. Bob Dickson   </div>
<div>For The Calgary Herald</div>
<div>969 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Heartbreaking hardly begins to describe the emotional torment surrounding the loss of a loved one to diseases such as H1N1. Those parents in poorer corners of the world who lose children to diseases preventable with cheap and effective vaccinations invariably suffer as we in the developed world do.</p>
<p>While thousands of parents in Canada stand in lines to ensure that their toddlers receive the free H1N1 vaccine, we should take a moment to remember the millions of parents whose poverty forces them to simply stand by while their children die from easily preventable diseases.</p>
<p>Last month, Margaret Chan, director general of the World Health Organization, made this comparison: "The H1N1 pandemic draws attention to the promise and dynamism of vaccine development today. Yet it also reminds us once again of the obstacles of bringing the benefits of science to people in the poorest nations."</p>
<p>According to a recent WHO report, vaccines are more readily available than ever before and the impact has been profound. Measles deaths alone fell by 74 per cent in the seven years from 2000 to 2007. Furthermore, the WHO reports that if all the vaccines now available against childhood diseases were widely adopted, an additional two million deaths a year could be prevented among children under five years old by 2015.</p>
<p>A great deal of work remains to be done to meet this goal. Life-saving vaccines still do not reach an astounding 24 million children who are the most at risk. To reach them, an additional $1 billion per year is required. That is why the WHO is calling on wealthy countries to sustain and increase funding for immunizations to build upon the progress made so far and, more importantly, to ensure that hard-won gains are not lost.</p>
<p>Ajebush Wakalto is a health extension worker. With a mere 12 months of training after graduating from Grade 10, she has the skills she needs to provide basic and preventive services in a health post in her remote community in Ethiopia. Ajebush helps members of her village of Timbicho to proactively prevent disease and provides vaccines for mothers and children. One of the vaccinations she provides, the DTP3, protects children in her community against diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis.</p>
<p>Diphtheria is a very contagious and potentially life-threatening bacterial disease. It attacks the throat and nose and, in more serious cases, it can attack the heart and nerves. It is most common in areas where people live in crowded conditions with poor sanitation, and children are most at risk. The WHO and UNICEF estimate that Ethiopia's national DTP3 coverage is currently at 69 per cent. In Timbicho, the vaccination coverage rate is around 80 per cent and Ajebush aims to get it up to 100 per cent.</p>
<p>One of her clients is Meseret Teshome, a mother of five, who visits Ajebush at the community health post. Meseret used to have to walk two hours to reach the nearest health centre. Now that the health post is in her community, she can meet the health extension worker regularly and her children are benefiting from increased access to basic immunizations and other health services. Meseret says that her children have less diarrhea and don't cough as much.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Immunizations Initiative is a homegrown Canadian initiative that has had tremendous global impact. Through the CIII, Canada has been a leader in ensuring the provision of basic immunizations to poor children worldwide.</p>
<p>A key objective of CIII has been to help achieve the 1990 World Summit for Children challenge which called for immunizing 90 per cent of one-year-olds worldwide, eradicating polio, eliminating neonatal tetanus, and reducing measles mortality by 95 per cent. To date, the global immunizations campaign, of which CIII has played a major part, has led to some amazing successes, like the 74 per cent drop in measles deaths referenced earlier.</p>
<p>In 2003, Canada announced a total of $80 million over five years for CIII. These funds supported both direct immunization funding and the strengthening of health-delivery systems in poor countries. In 2008, this funding was renewed for one year. Now, that year is up, and after many years of producing sustained and measurable impact, CIDA's support for CIII is in danger yet again of expiring.</p>
<p>Canada should not only renew its support for CIII, but should increase its support so that new cohorts of children are immunized where immunization programs have been successful and programs are expanded to new areas that have not yet been reached. The current global funding gap for immunization is about $1 billion a year, which would save an additional two million lives by 2015. Canada's fair share of this, based on the relative size of our economy, is an additional $50 million per year.</p>
<p>Basic immunization is one of the most cost-effective and life-saving foreign aid programs in existence. It should be held up as a clear and proud example of Canadian aid at its best, especially at a time when the effectiveness of foreign aid is often questioned and the global need is so great.</p>
<p>Right now, decisions are being made within CIDA that will determine whether or not CIII is renewed. It is critical that we act immediately to ensure this initiative continues to save lives. All parliamentarians and parties need to be aware of this highly effective program so they can speak powerfully in support to ensure the CIII not only continues, but strengthens and grows.</p>

</p>
<p>Just the other day I had an appointment to train a client and she showed up with a terrible cold that she said was finally clearing up.</p>
<p>Rather than carry on with our appointment, I suggested that she go home, get some rest and call me when she was a hundred per cent better.</p>
<p>I never want to risk getting myself or the members of Fitness Plus sick and with the recent scare of the H1N1 virus, now is not the time to start taking chances!</p>
<p>I really believe that we all need to take an active role in making this flu season safer.</p>
<p>Here is a list of some small things you can do at the gym to protect yourselves and others from getting sick.</p>
<p>Wipe down your machines</p>
<p>We all know that when we workout, we sweat, but did you know that some bacteria can survive on sweaty bike seats or elliptical handles for up to 3 days? Yikes! One way to protect ourselves against the spread of germs on weight or cardio machines is to wipe down your equipment. Even when you are in a hurry, it is important to clean off your machines. It only takes a second to grab the disinfectant bottle, some paper towels and wipe off your machine. Not only is this a common courtesy to other gym members, but it will go a long way to stop the spread of germs!</p>
<p>Wash your hands</p>
<p>We all know to wash our hands after we use the washroom but, to prevent the spread of germs this flu season, take this knowledge a step further and be sure to wash your hands after you work out. You can never be sure if the person before you disinfected the machine or if some of those sneaky germs were left behind, so it doesn't hurt to take matters into your own "hands" and wash up after a workout, especially if you are going to be eating a post-workout snack.</p>
<p>Bring your own water bottle</p>
<p>Because of the high levels of moisture, water fountains are ideal places for bacteria to grow at the best of times, let alone if someone has just coughed or sneezed on it. So, to keep yourself healthy, bring your own water bottle to the gym.</p>
<p>Stay home when you aren't feeling well!</p>
<p>I know we are all conditioned to think that we have to get our workouts in, and if you're like me, you feel guilty when you don't get it in, but working out when you are sick can actually do more harm than good. "Sweating out" the germs is an absolute myth. If you have a fever, working out can put too much strain on a heart that is already beating faster to cope with increased body temperature. If you have a cough or chest congestion, working out can put extra stress on your lungs, potentially make you sicker by leading to infection. If you still aren't convinced to rest up, do it for those around you. As we've all just learned, germs can be hiding all over the place, especially in the gym. So, to prevent your illness from spreading, stay home until you are feeling 100 per cent.</p>
<p>With little adjustments like these we can all stay healthy and happy this flu season!</p>

<p>Alberta has purchased an additional 45 ventilators to help the province's intensive care units cope with a potential siege of H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>The devices, which are on top of 106 ventilators the province bought in September, were ordered three weeks ago from a stockpile held by the Public Health Agency of Canada, said Alberta Health and Wellness spokesman Howard May.</p>
<p>"We were informed they were available and we said 'Yeah, sure, we'll take some'," May said. "It's prudent planning."</p>
<p>The ventilators arrived in Alberta on Monday, and will be distributed to hospitals and clinics based on need, he said. "We have them if we need them," May said.</p>
<p>May didn't know how much the ventilators cost.</p>
<p>The province paid $3.9 million for the 106 devices purchased in September.</p>

</p>
<p>-- An editorial from the Montreal Gazette</p>
<p>Auditor-general Sheila Fraser couldn't have picked a better time to release her report on the federal government's failure to adopt an emergency-response plan.</p>
<p>The chaotic rollout of the H1N1 vaccine has been front-page news for days. The sight of lineups of pregnant women, babies and the elderly fuelled anxiety and anger among many Canadians in equal measure.</p>
<p>With half of all H1N1 vaccine doses marooned in storage while various levels of government blame each other, did we even need Fraser's report to know that Canada can't handle an emergency? She puts the blame squarely on the shoulders of the federal government. Public Safety Canada's emergency response plan has yet to be endorsed by the government or the federal departments that are supposed to work with it.</p>
<p>The result is that the body whose job it is to co-ordinate federal departments, provinces and territories in the event of a major disaster lacks the authority to carry out its job.</p>
<p>Fraser said she could find no reason why the emergency response plan, in the works since Public Safety was created in 2003, has not been approved six years later.</p>
<p>But even without formal approval, the public-safety department could have done more to help prepare the country for an emergency, Fraser said.</p>
<p>Elementary measures have not been taken:The department has not identified how much food, water and energy supplies or medical services would be needed in an emergency. It has not helped put in place a system that would allow police, firefighters and other first responders to communicate with each other across the country. There are no standards for compatible radios. No plan is in place to protect the electrical grid or cyberspace from attack.</p>
<p>Nor is there any sense of urgency about fixing these problems. Fraser reported that for the past two years the sub-department responsible for emergency management has not spent a third of its budget.</p>
<p>If there's one thing the disorganization around the H1N1 flu vaccine has made clear, it's the need for a federal body empowered to lead a co-ordinated, centralized response to national emergencies.</p>

</p>
<p>Many H1N1 flu clinics were not open on Wednesday as most of the country observed Remembrance Day as an official holiday. The clinics that were open operated on a reduced schedule.</p>
<p>No updates were provided by the federal or provincial health ministries Wednesday on the number of new H1N1 flu-related deaths.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, York regional police launched an investigation Wednesday into how a tony private school north of Toronto was able to give the H1N1 vaccine to all its students, not just the ones who belong to a high-risk priority group. Officials at St. Andrew's College, one of the country's oldest all-boys boarding and day school, refused to comment on the allegations saying that they "had followed due process."</p>
<p>The school said that it had applied to receive the vaccine from York health officials and was approved because it has students from 25 different countries. But a spokesman with the health authority refuted the claim.</p>
<p>These allegations come after several other groups were reported to have jumped the queue for the H1N1 vaccine, including dairy farmers in Nova Scotia, professional hockey players and board members at a Toronto hospital.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Calgary, a man is wondering how his 27-year-old fiance went from the picture of health to a medically induced coma after contracting the H1N1 virus. Jaclyn Bates was put into a coma last week and her fiance, Rob Pearce, has been barred from seeing her. Doctors told Pearce that his fiance had suffered respiratory failure after she arrived at the hospital with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>He said doctors may try to wake the woman out of the coma later today.</p>

<p>Last Thursday, I had a doctor's appointment. There, posted on the wall, was a list of upcoming flu-shot clinics in Nanaimo. Beginning this past Monday, flu shots were to be given to the public. On that day there was to be a clinic at a rec centre starting at 9 a.m. My wife and I arrived at the clinic around 8:50. There were dozens of cars and a huge lineup. We got in line.</p>
<p>We saw a posted message telling us that (a) no one over 65 would get a shot that day, and (b) the shots were targeted for specific groups, one being first nations and another "remote." Because we are both teachers on a remote reserve in the Far North, due to return to work in a couple of weeks, we assumed we were eligible.</p>
<p>By 9:20, no shots had been given. The line went out the door into the rain and wind. Apparently, the staff was awaiting "vital paperwork."</p>
<p>A staff member approached me and asked if I was eligible according to the criteria. I replied that I was and explained that the school where I work has already suffered from a severe wave of H1N1.</p>
<p>"Are you first nations?" she asked.</p>
<p>I replied, "No, but I live and work in such a community."</p>
<p>She said, "You are not eligible; you're not first nations."</p>
<p>I had to leave. I walked through the rainswept parking lot, where I saw an elderly lady struggling to reach the building.</p>
<p>I asked if she was over 65. She replied in a frail, shaky voice that she was over 79. I told her she couldn't get a shot because she was too old and not first nations. As I helped her back to her car, she repeated, "But it said 'general public' in the paper!"</p>
<p>Perhaps the saddest part of this episode is that none of it shocks me. I was born in Canada. I've been working and paying taxes and supporting my community for 40 years. None of it matters, though, because in the eyes of government officials, I will always be considered non-first-nations and, if I live long enough, too old to matter.</p>

</p>
<p>When <span class="companylink">Johnson & Johnson</span>, maker of the Purell hand sanitizer, ended its run as a worldwide Olympic sponsor a year ago, <span class="companylink">Alda Pharmaceuticals Corp</span>. saw a chance to fill the void.</p>
<p>Alda, with a staff of 10 people in New Westminster, signed a contract in July to be the official supplier of hand sanitizers for the 2010 Winter Olympics. The stock has soared ever since.</p>
<p>"That really gave us instant credibility," Alda chief executive officer Terrance Owen, 63, said in an interview. "That's how the whole thing took off, and it's snowballed from there."</p>
<p>Alda more than doubled since July 15 and surged more than sixfold since the start of the year, when the company traded at 11 cents. Alda was trading around 66 cents a share Tuesday on the <span class="companylink">TSX Venture Exchange</span> in Toronto.</p>
<p>The company's T36 Antiseptic Hand Sanitizer was developed as a spinoff from the company's disinfectants in April, when an outbreak of swine flu emerged in Mexico and the U.S. and started spreading. The H1N1 influenza has since become a global pandemic, creating a surge in demand for flu-prevention goods such as hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>Alda, a 13-year-old company that first sold shares to the public in 2003, has seen demand "increase dramatically" for its newest product, according to Owen. It signed a supply deal with Loblaw Co.'s Asian grocery chain <span class="companylink">T&T Supermarket</span> last month, and is looking to put it in drugstores across Canada.</p>
<p>The company doubled its staff from a year ago, hiring three salespeople, a manager and administrative assistant. Alda is also seeking approval to sell the product outside Canada, in countries including Australia, the U.K. and the U.S.</p>
<p>Sales of hand sanitizers in the U.S. for the 52 weeks ending Oct. 3 jumped 23 per cent to $180 million US from a year earlier, according to <span class="companylink">The Nielsen Company</span>, which tracks consumer markets. In Canada, where hand sanitizers are a $25-million business, sales are up 44 per cent from a year ago, Nielsen said.</p>
<p>Messages left with Johnson & Johnson spokesman Marc Boston weren't immediately returned.</p>
<p>Alda, whose disinfectants were originally developed for hospitals, dental clinics and medical labs, is anticipating a "substantial" order out of the Winter Olympics, which begin in Vancouver and Whistler Feb. 12. Games organizers may buy dispensers and bags, and "tens of thousands" of 60-millilitre bottles to give away in gift packs for athletes, volunteers and the media, Owen said.</p>
<p>Alda's British Columbia roots may have helped it win over Games organizers in getting the contract, he said.</p>
<p>"The fact that we are local and small and use local suppliers and are nimble on our feet certainly was in our favor," Owen said.</p>
<p>Alda aims to use that Olympic exposure, combined with the swine flu pandemic, to turn the money-losing business with a market value of $34 million into a profitable company. Alda had a loss of $1.18 million on revenue of $282,261 for the year ended June 30, according to regulatory filings. "We're in the middle of a perfect storm here," Owen said. "We just have to get our product out there and get it into as many hands as possible."</p>

<p>Junk science has become a plague in the Internet era, but now the problem seems to be growing worse, with what we might call junk fiction. The human ability to confuse and panic ourselves seems to be growing even faster than genuine scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The U.S. space agency found it necessary this week to announce, in full formal solemnity, that the world will not be coming to an end on Dec. 21, 2012. A $200-million U.S. movie about that particular brand of apocalypse hits cinemas on Friday, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration felt the need to assure anxious Americans that the mysterious planet Nibiru does not exist and so is unlikely to strike the earth; that the Sumerians knew little about celestial mechanics; that the Mayan calendar does indeed extend past that date; and that we had many of these same rumours about May 2003, which came and went uneventfully.</p>
<p>Somewhere the marketing team behind this movie is out getting estimates on yachts and mansions, but we see something here that transcends mere hype. Mystical pseudo-science, conspiracy theories, and crank beliefs of all kind seem to be growing distressingly pervasive. From seeing a plot behind H1N1 flu inoculation to thinking Elvis is alive to thinking George Bush destroyed New York's twin towers to taking Dan Brown seriously to expecting the end of the world, too many people in so-called advanced societies are dabbling, or worse, in gnostic theories utterly divorced from reality.</p>
<p>We understand that the end of the world might make a good date movie, and that finding cabals under every cabbage leaf can be amusing. But the speed and intensity with which certain crackpot theories spread is also somewhat alarming. Why isn't it apparent that human progress is based on scientific method, reasoned analysis of problems, and simple common sense?</p>
<p>Here's how we like to think about these harebrained theories: People who believe in conspiracies just don't realize how difficult it is to organize anything.</p>

<p>Re: "Why aren't seniors on H1N1 priority list? critics ask" (Gazette, Nov. 10).</p>
<p>Your article states that even though those over 65 are less likely to contract H1 N1 they're more likely to die from it if they do catch it. Yet they find themselves at the bottom of the list when it comes to getting vaccinated, whether they have an underlying medical condition or not.</p>
<p>Sounds as if ageism is alive and well among those who set the priorities.</p>

<p>There seems to be something profoundly wrongheaded about the way various groups of citizens are prioritized for receiving the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Reportedly more than 60 per cent of those who have died from this strain of flu have been over 65 years old. Yet the government has de-prioritized this group on what seems highly speculative grounds - the theory that they are old enough so that they might have been exposed to an earlier outbreak of H1N1 in the 1950s.</p>
<p>This is a very questionable theory and puts lives at risk, and more than at risk as the death statistics show.</p>

<p>I met an angel this week. My wife and I went to the CSSS Lachine at the old Lachine Hospital. We heard there was no lineup for the H1N1 shot. Turns out the heads-up was good. The nurse managing first-stage admissions made a logical judgment call and cleared my wife, despite her lack of documentation. She wouldn't admit me, however, despite logic, guile, intimidation, and pleading.</p>
<p>As I waited for my wife, some queue-jumper, who clearly wasn't eligible, proceeded to pour a violent stream of profanity and abuse on the nurse who, in his tiny mind, was clearly responsible for the entirety of government policy.</p>
<p>The angel kept her eye on the task, ignored him, and served the next citizen in line as though nothing had happened. She had to be shaking inside.</p>
<p>Don't be a queue-jumper. Respect our health-care professionals. They've earned it.</p>

<p>Re: "Quit whining" (Letters, Nov. 10).</p>
<p>This week I drove my wife to the clinic at the old Lachine Hospital to get her H1N1 shot as she fit all the criteria. As there were exactly 12 people there, I asked a nurse (volunteer) if I could get my shot.The answer was a resounding no as I was 67 not 65.</p>
<p>Now this is a total lack of common sense. Some of the people doing the immunization were doing nothing as there was no one there.</p>
<p>When it comes to common sense there is absolutely none in the Quebec civil service.</p>

</p>
<p>It's not H1N1. But both the sovereignist and federalist movements in Quebec are infected by viruses.</p>
<p>In separate incidents on the same day this week, they showed the symptoms of their respective infections: by extremism in the case of the sovereignists, and by money in that of the federalists.</p>
<p>The incidents were the disorderly demonstration in Montreal against the visit of Prince Charles, and the withdrawal of Jean D'Amour from the Liberal caucus in the National Assembly.</p>
<p>Concerning the demonstration, it would be fair to describe the organizers and some of the participants as associates and even beneficiaries of Pauline Marois and Gilles Duceppe, the leaders of the Parti Québécois and the Bloc Québécois respectively.</p>
<p>The demonstration was organized by the Réseau de resistance du Québécois. The PQ and Bloc bought ads in its publication Le Québécois until early this year, when the RRQ forced the cancellation of a re-enactment of the battle of the Plains of Abraham with threats of violence.</p>
<p>Even after that, Marois and Duceppe accepted to participate with RRQ leader Patrick Bourgeois in the readings of nationalist texts, including that of the 1970 manifesto of the terrorist Front de libération du Québec, that replaced the cancelled re-enactment on the Plains.</p>
<p>Marois's and Duceppe's parties even helped provide Bourgeois with his platform, since the PQ contributed money and the Bloc technical support to the readings.</p>
<p>And this week's demonstration was supported by the Jeunes Patriotes du Québec. The JPQ, which is known for trying to intimidate federalists and disrupt their meetings, has also received encouragement and even financial support from the PQ and the Bloc.</p>
<p>Representatives of both parties regularly participate in the Jeunes Patriotes' more orderly public activities.</p>
<p>And last June, the JPQ publicly thanked elected members of the PQ and the Bloc as well as Québec solidaire, including PQ leader Marois, for financial contributions to one such activity.</p>
<p>A few hours before Tuesday's demonstration, D'Amour disclosed his involvement in a two-year-old possible violation of the political financing law.</p>
<p>D'Amour said that a construction contractor left an envelope containing an illegal cash contribution for another politician at D'Amour's house while he was out. He said he called the contractor and had him come get the money.</p>
<p>And so the spreading scandal of cash-stuffed envelopes given to politicians by contractors reached the party of Premier Jean Charest, whose government has been resisting calls for a public inquiry into the connection between public-works contracts and political contributions.</p>
<p>Sovereignists are not entirely immune to scandals involving money; the lobbying law that D'Amour might also have violated in another incident resulted from scandals involving a PQ government.</p>
<p>But most such scandals have involved federalist parties, and it's federalists who have suffered the most damage from them.</p>
<p>The federal Liberal Party still hasn't recovered in French Quebec from the sponsorship scandal, as shown in Monday's federal by-elections.</p>
<p>Before that, federalists blatantly ignored the campaign spending limits for the 1995 sovereignty referendum in organizing the Montreal "love-in" a few days before the vote.</p>
<p>Without breaking any law, the provincial Liberals have become the party of the wealthy by charging $1,000 a head and more for access to influential members at private, invitation-only events.</p>
<p>And since former Liberal premier Robert Bourassa coined the unfortunate expression "profitable federalism" nearly 40 years ago, federalists have appealed to the wallets of Quebecers rather than their hearts.</p>
<p>It's as though the S in "federalist" has been replaced by a dollar sign.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine shortage to close clinics; City officials not sure how long they'll be shut</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>798 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>C1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>A dwindling supply of the H1N1 flu shot will force Ottawa's vaccination clinics to grind to a halt by Friday, health officials announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The shortfall, the result of delays in manufacturing by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the vaccine's producer, has already forced other clinics across Canada to close temporarily.</p>
<p>The city's public-health officials, at the mercy of decisions being made by provincial and federal officials who are distributing vaccine, are not sure how long the clinics will remain closed.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we have no control over vaccine supply and must rely on other levels of government and the producing pharmaceutical company," Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health, said in a statement. "This temporary halt in service will be as brief as possible, and planning is already under way to ensure a smooth transition back to normal operations when adequate vaccine supply is delivered."</p>
<p>With roughly 29,000 doses in hand and another 26,000 expected to arrive before the week is over, the clinics are expected to have enough to last until the end of today.</p>
<p>After that, Levy said he had no idea when the next shipment would arrive, or how big the delivery would be, meaning the clinics will be suspended until the city receives more vaccine.</p>
<p>"We hoped it wouldn't happen, and we're disappointed that it is, but we've always known that we were going to be balancing supply, demand and our capacity to deliver," Levy said in an interview.</p>
<p>The remaining supply will be divided among several priority groups. About 15,000 doses have been earmarked for the clinics. Another 12,000 will go to newly designated priority groups such as police, firefighters, frontline correctional workers and frail seniors in hospitals and nursing homes.</p>
<p>Several thousand more doses will go to people living in group homes or shelters and are considered at high risk of developing flu-related complications. A small number of weekend clinics at those facilities are planned to vaccinate those groups, Levy said.</p>
<p>The remaining doses will be distributed to about 120 family doctors and allergists who have signed up to give the shot to their patients.</p>
<p>Initially, public-health officials had planned to wait until there was enough supply to send about 40,000 doses of the vaccine to family physicians. However, with the clinics shutting down, officials have decided to immediately distribute as many doses as they can spare to individual medical practices.</p>
<p>While Levy acknowledges that extending the doses to individual physicians makes it harder for public-health officials to ensure the shots are actually going to priority groups, he believes the benefits outweigh the risks.</p>
<p>"We're just trying to be as efficient as we can to get as much vaccine out as quickly as we can, and this is one way we can do it," he said.</p>
<p>By the end of today, Ottawa is expected to have vaccinated 190,000 residents, or about 20 per cent of the population.</p>
<p>Even with delays in the vaccine's rollout, the goal remains to vaccinate another 200,000 by the end of the month, Levy said.</p>
<p>That's because the city has built up enough of a pool of vaccinators sufficient to immunize more people quickly once the clinics start up again.</p>
<p>By Christmas, Levy expects another 300,000 people to be vaccinated, bringing the total to about 700,000, or about 70 per cent of the city's population.</p>
<p>The timeframe corresponds with provincial projections that suggest most of Ontario's 11 million residents won't be eligible for the vaccine until Christmas.</p>
<p>By that time, though, the worst of the H1N1 flu season could be over, raising the possibility that public-health officials could be sitting on a glut of vaccine that people won't feel is needed anymore.</p>
<p>Experts maintain the pandemic flu shot is still worth getting because H1N1 virus could resurface in the spring, although likely in a less contagious way as more people develop immunity to it.</p>
<p>"I think H1N1 is going to be in our milieu for a while," said Dr. Gary Garber, chief of the infectious-diseases division at The Ottawa Hospital. "The reason to get vaccinated once this acute wave is over is to protect yourself against what might come later in the season, and, if we improve the overall immunity of our population, then we won't see another major spike of this disease."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>How the vaccination program could have been done better</b>
</div><div>Wayne Boone   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>1105 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>As a security practitioner and as a Canadian citizen concerned for his health, I have watched the H1N1 vaccination program with both professional and personal interest.</p>
<p>The first thing that came to my mind was the classic question when any program has difficulties in confidentiality, integrity or availability was: "Why didn't they ask us sooner?" I am not a health-care professional, but as a Business Continuity Planning (BCP) specialist I understand operational planning and execution very well, as do my many professional colleagues across the country. This vaccination program could have benefitted from our technical advice.</p>
<p>My comments here focus at the operational and tactical levels; I will leave the strategic and financial finger-pointing to those much higher on the food chain. There are numerous key BCP principles that apply to this situation and it appears weren't followed, but the following five loom the largest.</p>
<p>Principle 1: This is not business as usual. As was made abundantly clear from our national medical officer of health, we have not done this before to this level. But the necessary factors were available for effective planning. These factors include: the maximum numbers of people to be vaccinated and therefore the numbers of doses required; the overall timeframe in which to complete the vaccinations in order to be effective in combatting the pandemic; the vaccination "throughput" required by site per geographical/population density area based on the time required to administer a single dose; the resultant number of medical practitioners and supporting staff required at individual sites; and the total number of sites required to meet the throughput requirements.</p>
<p>From these initial calculations, vaccination production requirements could be determined and appropriate sources (plural) could be contracted. These are not medical calculations, but rather planning calculations based on time and space.</p>
<p>Principle 2: Selection and maintenance of the aim. This is referred to in a military setting as the "master principle of war," but applies in any operational planning, especially for operations that have high risk (in this case to human life). The aim should have been developed and communicated clearly from the start. The science (as well as logic and security doctrine) dictates that the highest risk assets are to be protected first.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the prioritization for vaccination that was established (this was done very well) should have been adhered to consistently by all participants from the outset. Maintaining the aim takes both leadership and courage at all levels, including the courage to say no to queue-jumpers. Although the health-care professionals did not consider themselves "bouncers," someone had to do it in order to meet the aim (see depth below).</p>
<p>Likewise to meet the aim, production should have switched to H1N1 vaccination on a priority, 24/7 basis to meet the surge supply requirement. But this would have required what Dr. Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer of health, described as "the bold and courageous decision to follow the evidence, and abandon the seasonal flu vaccine," or at least delay it.</p>
<p>Principle 3: Worst-case approach. The basic concept of BCP is that the very worst case must be considered. In this case, the risk is that of significant casualties. Accordingly, one must focus on meeting that risk.</p>
<p>Regardless of the number of people polled who indicated that they would or would not get the vaccine, due diligence dictated that planning include the requirement to vaccinate all Canadians within the timelines dictated by the science. It is as simple as that. This is not the time for financial "risk management" that could result in failure to meet the aim.</p>
<p>Principle 4: No "SPOFs." All BCP planning serves to eliminate Single Points of Failure (SPOFs), the most telling of which is the current supplier of vaccines. <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> is a highly competent, high-quality and efficient vaccine manufacturer; however, as an inviolate BCP principle, there should never be an SPOF of any supply source, technical service, or personnel capability.</p>
<p>GSK was kind enough to respond to my questions regarding their production capability, and they have taken the initiative to triple their production capacity and double their filling capacity. While they note that they have a "robust, detailed and confidential" BCP of their own in case of a major interruption to their primary facility, and that they are working "around the clock to fill and package vaccine ... as quickly as possible," it is clear that the requirement is greater than the capacity of one supplier.</p>
<p>The decision to switch production from the adjuvanted version to the unadjuvanted version to address the concerns of pregnant women was another indicator that it would have been appropriate to have planned for additional facilities in order to produce the two versions concurrently. This is not GSK's fault. Operational planners should have eliminated this SPOF.</p>
<p>Principle 5: Depth. Finally, there is the perpetual question of resource limitations, especially personnel. To this I would say, reach out for volunteers.</p>
<p>Regarding primary staff, there are many retired medical personnel, personnel who could be diverted from lower priority functions in the short term (such as elective surgery), practitioners such as paramedics who could have their shifts adjusted to assist, members of the military reserves, school and nursing-home nurses, etc. who could have been brought to bear to the vaccination program. This again would take leadership on the part of hospital and other facility administrators to make their staffs available in the short term.</p>
<p>Regarding support staff, again there is an incredible volunteer base of service clubs, professional associations, military reserve and cadet units, scouting and guiding organizations, sports teams, and individual volunteers, all of whom could have been approached and trained to assist in administrative support, triage (separating the high-risk groups from the queue-jumpers), entertainment, amenities, tentage, etc. All of this could have been arranged and co-ordinated long before the vaccination program started, to accommodate a larger-scale operation. We had the time, but simply did not use it well.</p>
<p>Finally, all I can suggest is to inventory at the outset all of the potential resources at your disposal in a worst case scenario, and prepare them to provide the required services to optimize effectiveness. Interestingly, in many cases, if you ask us BCP specialists, we will do it for free.</p>

<p>Two West Island men were arrested early last week after a Brinks security guard working behind an automatic teller machine spotted the two allegedly committing a fraud.</p>
<p>The incident occurred at a bank on St. Charles Blvd. in Beaconsfield on Nov. 2 at 10:10 p.m.</p>
<p>The security guard called police with a description of the getaway car - an Acura - and a description of the two men.</p>
<p>Police intercepted the car nearby and found two men inside who fit the description. They had a lot of cash on them and equipment for cloning bank cards.</p>
<p>The men were arrested on the spot.</p>
<p>The accused are both 24. One is from Pierrefonds, the other from Dollard des Ormeaux.</p>

<p>A 50-year-old Pierrefonds man was vacuuming at home last week when he came face to face with a burglar.</p>
<p>"The man had been vacuuming on the second floor of his residence on Château Pierrefonds St. when he saw a stranger standing next to him," Montreal Police Constable Daniel Maheu said.</p>
<p>The incident took place just after noon on Nov. 4.</p>
<p>The homeowner screamed in fright and locked himself in the upstairs bathroom, Maheu said. The intruder then went downstairs, rummaged through a few desk drawers and left.</p>
<p>So far, nothing has been noticed as missing from the home.</p>
<p>Maheu said the man, who was dressed in black except for white shoes, entered the home through a window on the second floor of the home.</p>
<p>Station 4</p>
<p>Serving Dollard des Ormeaux</p>
<p>Police are asking for the public's help in identifying four young men, possibly in their 20s, who tried to set a fire at the former Spring Garden elementary school in Dollard des Ormeaux last week.</p>
<p>Montreal Police Constable Chantal Castonguay said a passer-by saw the four youths get out of a dark coloured, possibly green, older-model Toyota Tercell on Nov. 4 between 9 and 10 p.m. and walk up to the Sonata St. school, only to start to light a fire.</p>
<p>"But just at that moment, a dog started barking and the boys noticed people around, so they took off," Castonguay said.</p>
<p>Firefighters were called to the scene. But the fire went out by itself.</p>
<p>"The boys didn't have enough time to really get the fire going," Castonguay said. There was no damage to the building.</p>
<p>Spring Garden opened yesterday as an H1N1 vaccination site.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about the incident or the identity of the boys is asked to call Info Crime at 514-393-1133 or Station 4 at 514-280-0104.</p>

<p>Today's top stories from Report on Business :</p>
<p>Who suffered most in recession</p>
<p>A new study by Statistics Canada paints a picture of the labour market in the recession, showing who has been hit hardest and how the slump compares with the last two downturns. The study released today shows that Canadian companies cut jobs much faster than they did in the recessions of the early 1980s and early 1990s. Within five months of the labour market's peak in October, 2008, employment was down 2.1 per cent. That compares with 0.8 per cent in the same five-month period in the recession of the early 1980s, and 0.6 per cent in the early 1990s. The study also shows recent immigrants to Canada have been hurt far harder than Canadian-born workers. Among the findings:</p>
<p>• In recent months, employment levels have been relatively stable. Job losses ran on for 17 months in the 1981-82 recession and 11 months in the 1990-91 slump.</p>
<p>• Employment among immigrants who have been in Canada less than five years fell 12.9 per cent, more than five times the decline of 2.2-per-cent registered by Canadian-born employees. The bulk came in the manufacturing sector, which has been hit particularly hard.</p>
<p>• In the private sector, young people, lower-paid workers and families with children have suffered the most.</p>
<p>• Almost 450,000 jobs were wiped out in the private sector, compared with 55,000 in the public sector.</p>
<p>• Employment among workers earning less than $10 an hour fell almost 25 per cent, while employment increased among those earning $40 an hour or more.</p>
<p>• Employment among single mothers fell 6.8 per cent.</p>

<p>Intel, AMD settle long-running dispute</p>
<p>Intel Corp. agreed today to pay rival chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. $1.25-billion (U.S.) to settle outstanding legal disputes, a move that could weaken antitrust authorities' cases against Intel. The settlement ends a global campaign that AMD has been waging against its larger rival that stretches back 12 years. Regulators in Asia, Europe and the United States have taken action against Intel because of complaints by AMD that its business is being damaged by alleged anti-competitive behaviour. Intel, the world's top chip company, makes 80 per cent of the central processing units at the heart of personal computers. AMD said it will withdraw all its regulatory complaints worldwide and drop all pending litigation, including a case in the U.S. District Court in Delaware and two cases pending in Japan. Intel and AMD also sealed a five-year, cross-license deal and said they would give up any claims of breach from their previous license agreement. The deal is seen tamping down legal pressure that had become an increasing distraction for Intel, of the kind that has dogged Microsoft Corp for years.

<p>Mutual funds lose tax exemption fight</p>
<p>The mutual fund industry is still talking to the Ontario government about ways to help investors when the provincial sales tax is harmonized with the GST. While the province has decided to exempt certain items, in some cases at certain prices, Ontario will not extend that to the fund industry. Currently, there are no provincial taxes on mutual funds in Ontario or British Columbia, which also plans to harmonize sales taxes with the GST. The industry has said harmonization would mean an extra 8 per cent on management fees in Ontario and 7 per cent in British Columbia. The Canadian fund industry has been lobbying both provincial governments extensively, saying mutual funds are already unfairly taxed at four or five times the rates of other savings vehicles, such as term deposits, guaranteed investment certificates and stocks. The industry is discussing with Ontario the possibility of providing some kind of rebate to the fund companies.

<p>Medvedev calls for industrial overhaul</p>
<p>President Dmitry Medvedev laid out a plan today to move Russia's economy into the modern age and overcome the grim industrial legacy of the Soviet Union. He ordered a sweeping modernization of the Soviet-built military arsenals. But he also called for a “pragmatic” foreign policy aimed at attracting investment and improving living standards, rather than “chaotic actions driven by nostalgia and prejudice.” Mr. Medvedev said Russia can no longer afford to rely on an aging Soviet industrial base and to draw most of its revenues from exports of oil and gas, while trusting its security to Soviet-built nuclear arsenals. Russia needs to focus on innovation, he said, including research on new nuclear reactors and space technologies, and thinking about preparing for flights to other planets.

<p>CPP Investment Board sees jump in assets</p>
<p>The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board boosted its assets by $7.2-billion in the second quarter as stock markets rallied. Chief executive officer David Denison said today the fund was also able to make a “number of significant public, private and real estate investments” in the quarter, including a $300-million investment in Internet phone company Skype, which was spun off from eBay in September. It also launched a bid for logistics firm Livingston International Income Fund. This quarter has started out even busier: CPPIB teamed with the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan last week to make a hostile $6.5-billion offer for Transurban Group, which has stakes in six highways in Australia and two U.S. roads. Transurban's board rejected the bid, but the two sides are now in talks. Also last week, CPPIB joined with TPG Group in a $4-billion bid for IMS Health, which provides information services to the pharmaceutical industry.

<p>Euro zone heading out of recession?</p>
<p>Economists project that growth figures to be released Friday will show the euro zone is out of recession. Industrial production in the euro zone showed factory output rose a marginal 0.3 per cent in September, numbers today showed, marking the fifth consecutive gain among the 16 countries that share the common currency. This is fuelling hopes that economic growth data to be reported Friday will show gross domestic product in the region grew in the third quarter. There are still disparities across Europe. Spain, for example, reported today that its economy was still contracting in the third quarter, though at a slower pace than earlier. Its unemployment rate is now 17.9 per cent, the highest in the EU. And in Ireland, consumer prices tumbled by 6.6 per cent in October, on an annual basis, which the government said was the fastest pace since early 1931.</p>
<p>IEA warns of threat to recovery</p>
<p>A warning this morning from an official at the International Energy Agency: Rising oil prices could hurt the global economy as it fights its way out of the deepest crisis since the Great Depression. The Paris-based group, an adviser to almost 30 countries, projected in its monthly oil market report that global demand will rise in the fourth quarter of the year. That would be the first time demand has grown on an annual basis since the second quarter of last year. David Fyfe, who heads the agency's Oil Industry and Markets Division, warned that “if prices keep rebounding, there's a risk to the global economy as a whole, even to some of those economies in the Far East and even the Middle East.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/higher-oil-seen-threatening-recovery/article1360438/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/higher-oil-seen-threatening-recovery/article1360438/])</p>
<p>BA, Iberia strike merger deal</p>
<p>British Airways and Spain's Iberia approved a deal late today that sets the basis for a merger creating one of the world's biggest airline groups, with a fleet of 419 airccraft flying to 205 destinations. Iberia called it a "binding agreement." The company would take the form of new holding company that owns the two current carriers. Iberia would own 45 per cent, and British Airways 55 per cent, Iberia said. The deal is expected to be signed in the first quarter of 2010 and be approved by shareholders by the end of that year, the Spanish carrier said. The deal would need regulatory and shareholder approval. The two airlines have been discussing a merger since the summer of 2008.

<p>Internet chiefs brief Vatican officials</p>
<p>Vatican officials are learning about the Internet and digital youth culture. Executives from Facebook, Wikipedia and Google are briefing officials and bishops at a symposium that will also address Internet copyright issues and hacking, including testimony from a young Swiss hacker and an Interpol cyber-crime official. The meeting is hosted by the European bishop's media commission and is designed to delve into questions about what Internet culture means for the church's mission and how the church communicates that mission to others. Pope Benedict XVI has tried to bring the Vatican into the Internet age by launching a YouTube channel earlier this year. Officials say he also e-mails and surfs the Web. But the Vatican's online shortcomings have been woefully apparent.

<p>H1N1 hit to economy seen as mild</p>
<p>For all its misery on the human front, the H1N1 pandemic is not expected to have a major impact on the Canadian economy, Toronto-Dominion says in a new study. TD economist James Marple today laid out scenarios ranging from the worst case, similar to the deadly flu of 1918, to the most likely, a mild hit. Under the most probable scenario, even taking flu-related work absences into account, many businesses have contingency plans to limit disruptions. “In all likelihood, at least a portion of the work will be made up by employees who remain on the job,” Mr. Marple said. “And, given the advances in technology since the outbreaks in 1957 and 1968 allowing employees to readily work from home, it is reasonable to expect an even a smaller disruption in economic activity today.” Read the story (http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/h1n1-economic-hit-likely-mild-td/article1360853/[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/h1n1-economic-hit-likely-mild-td/article1360853/])</p>
<p>Playboy said to be in sale talks</p>
<p>Shares of Playboy Enterprises Inc. surged on reports the magazine publisher is in talks to be sold to Iconix Brand Group Inc. Bloomberg News today quoted unidentified sources saying the two sides are talking, and neither would comment. The report said Playboy has been looking for a buyer since the June appointment of chief executive officer Scott Flanders, who replaced founder Hugh Heffner's daughter Christie. Playboy stock had fallen about 75 per cent in five years before today. Iconix is known for its Candie's and London Fog brands of clothes.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 economic hit likely mild: TD; Flu outbreak not likely to reach scale to make noticeable dent in economy, Toronto-Dominion Bank economist says</b>
</div><div>Virginia Galt  </div>

</p>
<p>For all the misery the H1N1 pandemic is causing people felled by the flu bug, the outbreak is unlikely to reach the point where it depresses overall economic activity in Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank said Thursday.</p>
<p>“In the unlikely case of a more severe outbreak, increased employee absenteeism due to illness could have a negative – albeit temporary – impact on hours worked and, therefore, economic activity,” TD economist James Marple said in a report on the possible economic impact of H1N1.</p>
<p>At this point, however, the economic prognosis is not that dire, Mr. Marple said.</p>
<p>“Fears about H1N1 have heightened concern over the state of North American economies. While the impact on human lives should not be understated, at the current stage we do not believe the disease will reach a large enough scale to have a noticeable effect on aggregate economic activity,” he said.</p>
<p>In the past 100 years, prior to the current H1N1 outbreak, there have been three major flu influenza pandemics – the most serious in 1918, when the so-called Spanish flu infected close to 30 per cent of the world's population and killed an estimated 50 million people, or 3 per cent of the population, Mr. Marple said in looking at the best-case/worst-case scenarios.</p>
<p>Worst-case scenario</p>
<p>In the worst-case scenario – if the current H1N1 outbreak proves as severe as the flu of 1918 – Canada's gross domestic product could be negatively affected, somewhere in the range of 1.3 per cent to 2.8 per cent, Mr. Marple said, adding the prospect of such a severe outbreak is “highly improbable.”</p>
<p>And even in the event of a Spanish-flu type outbreak, the effects would be “relatively short-lived,” he said.</p>
<p>Less severe, and ‘unlikely'</p>
<p>In 1957 and again in 1968, influenza pandemics affected 30 per cent of the global population, but the death rate was much lower than in 1918.</p>
<p>“Should the spread of the disease prove worse than expected, an influenza pandemic similar to those of 1957 and 1968 would also likely prove to have a relatively mild effect on overall economic activity,” Mr. Marple said.</p>
<p>“The total economic impact of this type of pandemic could be a negative shock to real GDP growth of between 0.4 per and 0.8 percentage points.”</p>
<p>Most likely scenario: a mild case</p>
<p>The Canadian economy appears poised to withstand the current H1N1 pandemic, even taking flu-related absences into account, Mr. Marple said.</p>
<p>“Many businesses will have contingency plans to avoid the disruption in activity ? In all likelihood, at least a portion of the work will be made up by employees who remain on the job. And, given the advances in technology since the outbreaks in 1957 and 1968 allowing employees to readily work from home, it is reasonable to expect an even a smaller disruption in economic activity today.”</p>
<p>The SARS experience</p>
<p>Overall, real GDP declined in Canada by 0.5 per cent, annualized, in the second quarter of 2003, a decline that was attributable, in part, to the impact of the SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>“Nonetheless, this downturn in the Canadian economy can not be entirely laid at the feet of SARS ? At least a portion of the decline was due to non-SARS-related factors such as the appreciation of the Canadian dollar and travel fears in the U.S. as a result of the outbreak of the Iraq war.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tory stimulus ads ripped as $3M pat on the back; 'Creating Jobs' campaign 'should offend all taxpayers,' Liberal says</b>
</div><div>Richard J. Brennan   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>354 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A08</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The Conservative government spent more than $3 million of taxpayers' money in September on an advertising campaign that amounted to little more than self-promotion, a Liberal critic says.</p>
<p>The newspaper and web campaign, called Creating Jobs, didn't attempt to inform Canadians about how infrastructure stimulus spending was creating employment opportunities - only that the Conservatives declared it was, Liberal MP Martha Hall Findlay (Willowdale) said Wednesday.</p>
<p>"That offends me and it should offend all taxpayers," she said.</p>
<p>Hall Findlay said she could understand if the money was spent educating Canadians about H1N1 flu, "but patting yourself on the back and making big pronouncements is not part of what taxpayers' money should be spent on."</p>
<p>The Liberals have been focusing on money the Conservative government has been spending on what the Liberals call "meaningless" advertising campaigns, estimating the figure this year could reach $100 million.</p>
<p>They have also been pressing the government to prove that infrastructure stimulus spending has created jobs.</p>
<p>A government document shows that Cossette Communication Inc., solely responsible for Ottawa advertisement buys since 2003, spent $3,111,877.44 from Infrastructure Canada on advertising from Sept. 14 to Sept. 29.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Transport Minister John Baird said in an email Wednesday the government is "committed to ensuring that Canadians know about the effects of Canada's Economic Action Plan and how taxpayers' money is being spent. The ads are high-impact ways for Canadians to learn about the projects in their area."</p>
<p>Baird is also responsible for Infrastructure Canada.</p>
<p>The money was spent around the time of the release of the government's third economic report card.</p>
<p>Hall Findlay said the Liberal opposition has been focusing on the blurring of the government of Canada with the Conservative party.</p>
<p>"They are in effect making it appear as though the government largesse is also a big promotion for the Conservative party," she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Santa is packing Purell this year You better not cough You better not sneeze You better not hack Santa's asking you, please</b>
</div><div>Francine Kopun   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>514 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>GT01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Santa wants children with symptoms of H1N1 to stay home until they're feeling better and not climb onto his lap for pictures because it could put others at risk of contracting the virus.</p>
<p>"I think it's important that people know that Santa's been thinking about this," says Steven Norman, Santa at Mississauga's Dixie Outlet Mall.</p>
<p>Norman, 62, got his H1N1 flu shot and will be carrying an alcohol-based hand sanitizer in his pocket as he strolls the mall. His Santa station will be disinfected every hour, and he will gently ask children who appear ill with the flu to return another time.</p>
<p>He's not alone. The Santa Claus parade is on Sunday and Santas are taking up position at GTA malls.</p>
<p>Jennifer Andrews, who runs a school in Calgary that trains Santas for work around the world, says she has sent guidelines to hundreds of Santas on preventing transmission of H1N1.</p>
<p>"If the children are ill, we're recommending that they come back and see him another time."</p>
<p>She's asking clients who hire Santas from her school to set up handwashing or hand-sanitizing stations along the red carpet to Santa's chair. Santa's elves can help children comply.</p>
<p>Henry Paquet, head of the Santa Claus Association of Quebec, urges Santas to minimize physical contact. That means no kisses and no sick kids on Santa's lap.</p>
<p>He says sugar plum fairies and elves should help Santa by offering tissues to children with runny noses. The closer they get to the beard, the greater the possibility of transmission, says Paquet.</p>
<p>"It's the same principle as daycare. You don't bring your kids to daycare if they're sick."</p>
<p>Santas everywhere are being asked to change their white gloves several times a day and, if they use fake beards and wigs, to change them as often as possible.</p>
<p>John Dixon, who will greet children at Eglinton Square in Scarborough this season, says he keeps a blanket on his knees for photo shoots and plans to change it often.</p>
<p>He's not too worried about himself. In 14 years as the mall's Santa, he's never had to take a sick day.</p>
<p>The grandfather of three works overtime at his job at a printing factory to store up the six weeks he uses each year to take on Santa's role.</p>
<p>"I'm not a robot Santa. I live in this area. I know a lot of the kids," says Dixon.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Shoppers targets growth in pharmacy-friendly provinces</b>

<p>RETAILING REPORTER</p>
<p>Jurgen Schreiber will look to expand his Shoppers Drug Mart stores in provinces such as British Columbia that pay pharmacies for taking a bigger role in the health care system – including providing consumers with H1N1 influenza vaccinations.</p>
<p>The suggestion from Shoppers' chief executive officer that it might snub provinces that look unfavourably at pro-pharmacy policies comes as Ontario and Alberta discuss controversial drug regulatory reforms that could squeeze the bottom line of pharmacies. The changes will eventually surface in other provinces, analysts predict.</p>
<p>Shoppers signalled yesterday that the Alberta reforms, which took effect last month, “may have an adverse impact on the company's business, sales and profitability.” The company had a similar warning about the Ontario proposals earlier this year.</p>
<p>“We see some provinces that are very progressive,” Mr. Schreiber told analysts yesterday. “These are provinces we like to invest in.”</p>
<p>The bulk of Shoppers' almost 1,200 stores are in Ontario, which is looking at reforms that could reduce allowances paid to pharmacies by generic drug manufacturers for stocking their drugs. Shoppers and other drug store retailers want the government to offset the financial pain by rewarding them for pharmacists' services, such as flu shots and patient counselling.</p>
<p>B.C. is an example of a “progressive” province where Shoppers is already being reimbursed for providing H1N1 vaccinations, John Caplice, a senior vice-president at Shoppers, said in an e-mail.</p>
<p>“There is much more that pharmacy can do as a front-line provider of community-based health care services, provided [there are] proper levels of reimbursement,” he said.</p>
<p>He said Shoppers' pharmacists across the country “are responding to tens of thousands of calls from patients, for which there is no reimbursement, who are inquiring about H1N1.”</p>
<p>Analysts have predicted that the Ontario reforms alone could shave Shoppers' earnings by between 20 cents and 35 cents per share. Yesterday, the company reported third-quarter profit of 79 cents a share, up from 74 cents a year earlier and a penny less than forecast by analysts.</p>
<p>Mr. Schreiber said it's too early to assess the impact of the proposed and actual changes, and talks with the provinces are still ongoing.</p>
<p>But Shoppers has invested heavily in Ontario and, in the future, will look to pour money into provinces that can ensure the chain's continuing profit growth, he said.</p>
<p>Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis, Mo., said the biggest concern for Shoppers is in Ontario where the company does the most business. “It's a wild card,” he added. “It's a black cloud hanging over the stock.” Shoppers shares have shed about 7 per cent in the past year amid worries about the reforms, and shed another 1.55 per cent yesterday.</p>
<p>In Alberta, new rules which went into effect last month, cut the pricing of generics for drug stores by almost half, said Robert Gibson, head of research at Octagon Capital. Alberta is expected to enact further regulations.</p>
<p>As well, at least one third-party insurance payer, Telus Health Solutions, decided recently to reduce its pricing to drug stores in Ontario, as of Nov. 24. “We expect other benefits managers to follow suit,” Mr. Gibson said in a recent report.</p>
<p>“Shoppers' profitability on branded drugs will suffer.”</p>

<div id="hd"><b>What? Us worry? No H1N1 fear here -</b>

</p>
<p>JIRI TLUSTY, Andre Deveaux and Tyler Bozak of the Toronto Marlies have all experienced serious bouts of the flu and Tlusty's brief recall to the Toronto Maple Leafs started a series of controversial events that saw all Maple Leafs and Marlies players receive the H1N1 flu shot.</p>
<p>The Marlies, including those three skaters, are the visitors Friday night at the MTS Centre, but nobody on the Moose seems worried about banging into or tussling with those who may have been exposed to the nasty bug.</p>
<p>"I think you're more apt to catch it if one guy on your own team has it," said veteran centre Marty Murray. "We're watching what we do with water bottles, towels, on airplanes... Like a lot of people, we're washing our hands and crossing our fingers."</p>
<p>The Moose at one point thought they might be included in the high-risk group that has priority for early H1N1 shots, but the team now says it will wait until the vaccine is available to the public.</p>
<p>"I wouldn't even have thought of it about Friday's game," Moose defenceman Nolan Baumgartner said. "We've played 19 games so far and I'm sure there have been other guys sick on other teams... We've had guys sick on our team this year, too. I just don't think we're concerned. If you get sick, you get sick... We're taking precautions. You see all the hand-sanitizers around here. We have our own water bottles."</p>
<p>Power play evolving</p>
<p>THE power play is a good bet to help the team break out of its drought of having scored just nine goals in the last 10 games, about the worst offensive stretch in franchise history.</p>
<p>But Wednesday's power-play time during the practice of more than two hours at the MTS Centre was hit-and-miss. At times, lots of miss.</p>
<p>"Ah, it's always a work in progress," coach Scott Arniel said, his team without a power-play goal in each of its five straight losses (zero for 19). "You're constantly trying to work on creating shots and it gets hard, because guys don't want to hit each other in front of the net with shots. ."</p>
<p>With eight regulars out, either hurt or in Vancouver or both, the team can't really afford to start implementing risky practice habits.</p>
<p>'Bag skate' punishing</p>
<p>ARNIEL said that Wednesday's long conditioning skate at the end of a two-hours-plus practice was just normal routine.</p>
<p>"We haven't had a chance to do much of that conditioning," he said after what's generally known as a "bag skate."</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>In hand sanitizer we trust; From communion bread on toothpicks to bleach in the holy water, houses of worship are taking measures to prevent the flu's spread</b>
</div><div>INGRID PERITZ   </div>
<div>861 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- Call it worship without worry: An Italian inventor has devised an electronic holy-water dispenser to reduce exposure to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The device, already inspiring interest worldwide, uses an infrared sensor like those found in bathroom soap dispensers to squirt blessed water into parishioners' hands. The inventor, Luciano Marabese, said he dreamed up the idea to preserve religious tradition in the face of the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>The high-tech creation underscores how the H1N1 virus is reshaping religious rituals as ministries struggle to spread the faith without spreading the flu. Houses of worship everywhere, including in Canada, are deploying inventive solutions to traditional rites.</p>
<p>At Runnymede United Church in Toronto, for example, communion bread last Sunday was served on toothpicks, like canapés. The servers didn't wear white cloth gloves, but they did wear surgical gloves.</p>
<p>“We brought in the toothpicks so people weren't putting their fingers in the bowl,” said Rev. Lillian Perigoe, one of the ministers at the church.</p>
<p>Rituals are important, she said, but in a day of heightened flu awareness, they need to be balanced with public-health precautions.</p>
<p>“We want to come together as a community and be supporting one another, but we need to visibly indicate that we're trying to be as careful as possible, to make it safe for people to come together,” Ms. Perigoe said.</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Montreal has issued H1N1 directives to reduce flu risks. They call for priests to give communion on the hand, not the tongue, and to cease having parishioners drink from a communal chalice.</p>
<p>The practice for parishioners of dipping their hands into holy water from the font to make the sign of the cross is being temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>But one priest in Montreal was so intent on continuing it in his parish that he added bleach to the water. The effort, though well-meaning, backfired.</p>
<p>“He had good intentions – he made sure there were no germs in the water – but other problems arose,” said Monsignor Jean Fortier, vicar-general at the Montreal archdiocese. “Was he ready to pay for the clothing stained by bleach?”</p>
<p>At the Shaare Zion Synagogue in Montreal, Rabbi Lionel Moses has done away with the traditional practice of letting people kiss or touch the Torah scroll as it's carried through the aisles during services.</p>
<p>Instead, worshippers raise their hand toward the scroll without touching it. And rather than a handshake, the rabbi offers an elbow bump.</p>
<p>“I kid people that I'm not trying to elbow them out of here,” Mr. Moses said. “It's all preventative. We don't know who's carrying the virus, and we don't want to spread the virus unnecessarily.”</p>
<p>Mosques around Montreal, where worshippers pray shoulder to shoulder, have also been encouraged to step up preventive measures, said Salam Elmenyawi, president of the Muslim Council of Montreal. He said imams are urging worshippers to increase ritual hand and face washing before prayers.</p>
<p>Hand sanitizers have become standard features inside houses of God. And passing the peace has been modified into a myriad of hygienic ways. Instead of shaking hands or embracing, churchgoers are bowing, fist-bumping and throwing arms over their neighbour's shoulder, being sure to stand side-to-side without facing one another.</p>
<p>Younger members of an Anglican church in Kamloops, B.C., adopted elbow bumping as the greeting of peace. “There was a sense that if we shouldn't hug or embrace one another, we want to signify a sense of fellowship among us,” said Ven. Paul Feheley of the Anglican Church of Canada.</p>
<p>Some churches are already pondering how to organize religious gatherings if the pandemic gets worse. The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of St. John's notes that the last time it drew up a pandemic plan was in 1918, in response to the Spanish flu – at which time, all churches were closed.</p>
<p>This time, however, churches have 21st-century technology at their disposal. Some Canadian churches and synagogues offer podcasts of their services, and are ready to take their message to the masses if need be – directly in the sanitized safety of their own homes.</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Anti-flu measures</p>
<p>The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Toronto, like several religious organizations across Canada, has issued guidelines to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus. This month, the archdiocese upgraded its anti-flu measures, calling on parishes to implement the following changes at all masses.</p>
<p>• Temporarily suspend communion from the chalice.</p>
<p>• Temporarily suspend communion on the tongue.</p>
<p>• Provide hand-cleaning stations near church entrances.</p>
<p>• Refrain from shaking hands during the sign of the peace. A nod, bow or other appropriate gesture should be encouraged.</p>
<p>• Those distributing communion are asked to wash their hands before mass. An alcohol-based sanitizer should be provided so that all ministers can sanitize their hands before and after distributing communion.</p>
<p>• Remind parishioners that if they're feeling ill, it is best to stay home.</p>

<div>THE H1N1 PANDEMIC</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Vaccinating the nation: $1.5-billion and climbing; The flu-shot program is costing Canada almost double what was expected. Some doctors argue it's not worth it</b>
</div><div>PAUL WALDIE AND CAROLINE ALPHONSO   </div>
<div>1102 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>Vaccinating Canadians against H1N1 is costing the country nearly twice as much as health officials expected and the tally could easily climb above $2-billion before the pandemic has subsided.</p>
<p>The national inoculation program is only a few weeks in, but $1.51-billion is already being spent, according to a review of estimates from federal, provincial and territorial governments. The actual figure is likely much higher because many provinces are still revising their costs while others have yet to release total estimates.</p>
<p>Even at $1.51-billion, the vaccination effort is proving far more expensive than health officials estimated. In September, provincial and territorial health ministers predicted the cost of buying the vaccine and delivering it at around $16 a dose, or $806-million in total based on the 50.4 million doses ordered. The total cost is currently running at about $30 a shot and climbing.</p>
<p>“I think we said right from the beginning that the on-the-ground part of this was probably always the biggest</p>
<p>“It's always what people underestimate and this is a huge operation. We've seen that play out, the difficulty in running this program.”</p>
<p>Dr. Wilson said it won't be known whether the money being spent on this vaccination campaign is justified until after the virus passes. If rolling out the vaccine in October, instead of November as previously planned, helped protect a large segment of the population and did not hinder workplace productivity, then the cost is justified, he said.</p>
<p>“We're sort of in the grey zone, is it worth it or not? We'll have to see how this plays out to determine that. If there is a potential third wave and the vaccine program has helped mitigate that in Canada … then it still may be worth it,” Dr. Wilson said.</p>
<p>But other health experts questioned the cost, saying the public expense far outweighs the seriousness of the illness.</p>
<p>“You really have to ask serious questions about the cost-benefit,” said Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer of health who is now the medical officer of health for Ontario's Hastings and Prince Edward Counties Health Unit. “I think this is the most overhyped, overblown exercise I've ever been a part of. We continue to lavish resources on a problem that is just not that big.”</p>
<p>Public health officials say costs have climbed because of an unexpected surge in demand for the vaccine and interruptions in supply. That forced many regional health authorities to open more clinics and alter distribution plans.</p>
<p>“We really, quite honestly, weren't expecting quite the lineups for vaccines,” David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, said in a recent interview. He added that it's important to keep in mind that this is the largest immunization program in Canadian history.</p>
<p>“This is just so unprecedented in terms of what the provinces and territories have actually been able to accomplish, in getting [the number of people vaccinated], in the space of one week, normally what wouldn't be done for a month or two,” he said.</p>
<p>The costs of the H1N1 program start with the vaccine itself, which is made by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>. The federal government ordered 50.4 million doses for $403.2-million in total. The federal government is covering 60 per cent of that amount, with the provinces and territories picking up the remainder.</p>
<p>But the cost of getting that vaccine into millions of arms has jumped far higher, and faster, than health officials expected.</p>
<p>Take Manitoba, for example. In September, the province announced a detailed H1N1 preparedness plan and set aside $47-million for the program. That was supposed to be enough to buy the vaccine and pay for distribution, extra health-care staff, masks, gloves and gowns. But less than two months later, Premier Greg Selinger said the program's cost could double.</p>
<p>Last week, Quebec's Health Minister said the province will spend at least $200-million on H1N1 vaccinations and Alberta has put its figure at $100-million. By contrast, Alberta spends about $3.2-million on free seasonal flu shots annually.</p>
<p>Some provinces are sticking to their original forecasts. British Columbia, for example, set aside $80-million for all H1N1 efforts in September. That included $13.7-million to cover its share of the cost of the vaccine doses. “I believe we are still well within the envelope,” Perry Kendall, B.C.'s provincial health officer, said in an e-mail yesterday.</p>
<p>Ontario has budgeted $650-million for its H1N1 program, far more than any other jurisdiction, including the federal government. And yet, provincial officials acknowledge that figure could change depending on the severity of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“This is only a rough estimate at this point and the costs could go higher when the extraordinary costs to the public health system are factored in,” David Jensen, a spokesman for the Health Ministry, said in an e-mail yesterday.</p>
<p>As a comparison, the health-care costs from the SARS outbreak in 2003 were about $845-million in Ontario, but that amount included compensation to health-care workers.</p>
<p>The various provincial estimates likely don't include a host of additional H1N1-related costs being incurred by municipalities and others. For example, the chair of the Vancouver Board of Education has estimated it will spend an extra $300,000 this year for H1N1 related items in schools, such as additional hand sanitizers, wipes, facial tissues, spray bottles and soaps.</p>
<p>Experts are a long way from determining the effectiveness of mass inoculation campaigns. One study published last year by the Public Health Agency of Canada examined Ontario's seasonal flu-shot program. The province was the first in Canada to adopt a universal program in 2000 covering all residents (most provinces offer seasonal flu shots only to at-risk populations).</p>
<p>While critics have questioned the cost-effectiveness of the Ontario program, the study found the province had fewer influenza-associated deaths, hospitalizations and emergency-room and doctors-office visits than provinces with targeted programs.</p>

<p>Toronto -- Thank you for asking why our children are still waiting for H1N1 vaccine (The Children Still Wait – Nov. 11). My 11-year-old is starting to recover from H1N1 after three days; my 9-year-old is in bed with a fever.</p>
<p>Over the past few weeks, several parents have told me they aren't worried about H1N1 because their entire families (in one case, five people) had been vaccinated. When I asked how that could be, since only one member was in the so-called priority group, the answer was the same: The family had lined up with the one priority-group member at a public clinic, when they got to the front, they were all vaccinated.</p>
<p>Where is the accountability on the part of people administering the vaccine at public clinics? On a day like today, when my children are suffering, I am lamenting the loss of Sheela Basrur, who handled the SARS epidemic so deftly. If she were in charge, I think we'd be in a much different situation than we are.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine available for most kids - Children from six months to 18 years offered H1N1 shots today</b>
</div><div>By Carol Sanders   </div>
<div>904 words</div><div>12 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>With more kids getting sick, missing school and showing up at the emergency room, health authorities are offering the H1N1 flu shot to school-age children and opening a clinic to treat kids with flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Starting today, children between six months and 18 years of age can get the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Providing H1N1 flu shots to school-age children should help reduce the spread of disease to others and help protect all family members who may be at risk, the province said in a bulletin issued Wednesday.</p>
<p>"It should also reduce the risk of and help to address concern about severe illness and death in school-aged children."</p>
<p>Nine-year-old Jack Dunsford is one of those concerned kids who can now get the vaccine.</p>
<p>"I kind of want it," the Grade 4 student said Wednesday. "I don't want to get the swine flu."</p>
<p>Jack said he learned getting H1N1 flu could be deadly when he heard about a healthy 13-year-old boy dying from it in Ontario last month.</p>
<p>His mom, Jennifer Dunsford, said she wants Jack and his sister, Aimee, 11, to both get the H1N1 vaccine. Aimee is averse to getting the vaccine, but her mom, a nurse, is pushing for it.</p>
<p>"I'm more concerned about them getting severe H1N1 than I'm concerned about vaccine side effects," said Dunsford. "It's pretty awful."</p>
<p>City flu clinics reopened this morning on the heels of the first confirmed death from H1N1 this season. On Tuesday, Manitoba Health announced someone between the age of 18 and 65 with underlying medical conditions died of H1N1 somewhere in the province.</p>
<p>No further details -- including the person's gender, date of death, or where they resided -- were made public.</p>
<p>The person's death is the first H1N1-related death in Manitoba this fall in the second wave of the virus.</p>
<p>Last spring, seven Manitobans died of H1N1.</p>
<p>Twelve clinics in Winnipeg are slated to open at 9:30 a.m. and will continue vaccinating people on the priority list, including school-age kids.</p>
<p>Dr. Sande Harlos, Winnipeg Regional Health Authority medical officer, said kids are being offered the vaccine at the mass clinics, not in their schools, because they are more efficient.</p>
<p>"We had a lot of learning from the meningitis outbreak in high school," said Harlos. The logistics of staging that vaccine program a few years ago required consent forms from parents and was a time-consuming process, said Harlos.</p>
<p>Public health workers were able to vaccinate 45,000 students in two weeks, compared with 101,000 people given H1N1 shots in less than two full weeks, Harlos said.</p>
<p>If you want to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible, then mass clinics are the way to do it, she said.</p>
<p>In Winnipeg, Children's Hospital emergency department has been flooded by kids with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"On a normal day, the ER for children will see between 100 and 120 kids," said WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham. "They've had from 160 to over 190," in the past two weeks, and about one half with influenza-like illness.</p>
<p>To take some of the pressure off the Children's ER, the WRHA is opening a satellite clinic in Children's Hospital tonight and Friday night from 6 p.m. until 9 p.m. On Saturday and Sunday, it opens from 2 p.m. until 5 p.m. Patients will still be asked to go to the Children's emergency department, where they will be registered and escorted to the satellite clinic. There, they will be seen and treated by medical staff as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>"This is a way to help decrease crowding in the ER," said Graham.</p>
<p>Late last week, there were 24 Manitoba schools reporting higher-than-usual absence levels, down slightly from the 27 earlier.</p>
<p>The province first directed school divisions to post daily school-by-school reports on their websites more than three weeks ago.</p>
<p>The Manitoba Junior Hockey League also began asking its teams to report higher-than-usual absences of players with the flu.</p>
<p>On Tuesday night, the Waywayseecappo Wolverines and the Neepawa Natives of the MJHL had their games postponed because of the flu. League commissioner Kim Davis said that several of the Wolverines came down with the flu and two have confirmed H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>The previous Tuesday, it was the Neepawa MJHL team that was sidelined by flu when 16 or 17 players and coaches got sick and, again, there were a couple of confirmed H1N1 cases, said Davis. He said the Neepawa team is back to normal, and Waywayseecappo is on the mend.</p>
<p>"We hope this is the end of it," said Davis.</p>
<p>"We've not heard from any other teams in the league about a large number of players being ill."</p>

<p>Consent form for older teens</p>
<p>H1N1 clinics would prefer those under 18 came with a parent but will vaccinate older teens on their own with a signed consent form that they've downloaded from the Internet.

<p>For years, administrators have struggled to motivate reluctant health-care workers to get a flu shot, only to see about four in 10 nurses, doctors and others comply. This season, it seems, the message finally got through.</p>
<p>Hospitals and other health-care organizations are reporting the uptake on the H1N1 influenza vaccine among their staff is far above the usual rate of 30% to 50%. As many as 80% of workers in some medical units have been immunized in the first two weeks of the campaign.</p>
<p>As vaccination clinics at hospitals, nursing homes and other institutions are still running and meeting plenty of demand, the numbers are expected to rise further still.</p>
<p>The statistics include workers not at particular risk for severe illness, suggesting there will be a surge of demand among the general, relatively healthy public when it gets access to the vaccine in coming weeks. If so, a repetition of the lineups seen earlier in the campaign would seem inevitable.</p>
<p>"Since I've been here, this is the most that [influenza inoculation] has been talked about," said Nick Cox, a spokesman for Halifax's IWK Health Centre, one of Atlantic Canada's biggest hospitals. "There's more interest, more uptake, more lineups. You can just see it."</p>
<p>About 67% of the hospital's 1,100 staff had been immunized as of Monday, with shots still being administered.</p>
<p>Infection-control doctors and hospital administrators argue that vaccination of medical workers against the flu is simply the right thing to do, citing studies that show immunizing staff can protect patients from a potentially deadly virus.</p>
<p>The response to the H1N1 vaccine among health workers, however, may have been driven more by personal fear of the new bug than altruism, hospital officials and doctors said.</p>
<p>"It's the pandemic. This disease is more severe; it's obvious this disease is more severe," said Dr. Allison McGeer, an infectious-disease specialist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, where staff showed much more interest than usual in getting injected. "People see it as more of a risk to them than the seasonal flu."</p>
<p>The prospects for a good response to the pandemic vaccine did not seem great a few weeks ago, though, as nurses' unions warned they would oppose any attempt to force their members to be immunized, citing in part fears of temporary paralysis, a one-in-a-million side effect of the shots.</p>
<p>At Toronto acute-care hospitals last year, uptake on the seasonal flu vaccine was just 42%, said Dr. McGeer. A study published recently in the Canadian Journal of Infection Control looked at a new program in a Halifax hospital that uses staff "champions" to lobby colleagues about the benefits of the vaccine. Uptake on the seasonal shot was 52% under the new program's influence, compared to 41% without it.</p>
<p>This season at Montreal's McGill University Health Centre, in contrast, 80% to 90% of staff in emergency department and intensive-care units got shots, said Ian Popple, a spokesman.</p>
<p>At the London Health Sciences Centre in southern Ontario, clinics are still serving health-care workers, but about 56% of the 10,000 staff have been immunized in a little more than a week, compared with 44% in the entire, six-week flu season last year, a spokesman said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Why it's good an MLA bashed the Charter</b>

</p>
<p>On one hand, MLA Pat Pimm's preference for getting rid of the Charter of Rights is alarming. It suggests that he's a lot more comfortable with government intrusions into the private lives of citizens than he should be.</p>
<p>But it is refreshing to have a new MLA who isn't sticking to a script crafted by communication staff. Pimm is, so far, apparently willing to say what he thinks, even if it's not in line with party policy.</p>
<p>Pimm is a Liberal, newly elected in Peace River North to replace Senator Richard Neufeld.</p>
<p>And in one of his first speeches, during debate on a bill to deny welfare to people facing outstanding arrest warrants, he took aim at the Charter.</p>
<p>"I just don't think it's a good document whatsoever myself," Pimm said in the legislature.</p>
<p>"For 99 per cent of the people out there, that document doesn't even need to exist, first off. It's only about one per cent or two per cent of the people that it's even developed for, and it's to keep the lawyers and the judges and everybody working to support the system." (Thanks to the Lower Langdale Tattler, an irregular publication of NDP MLA Nicholas Simons, for reporting Pimm's comments.)</p>
<p>What the Charter does is set out the basic rights of Canadians. We can say what we think and follow our religious beliefs without government intrusion. Basic principles of justice have to be followed if the state wants to interfere with our lives.</p>
<p>Police can, for example, search our homes, but only if they have a good reason.</p>
<p>Pimm's position appears to be that decent citizens don't need their rights protected. Governments know best about what must be done for the greater good.</p>
<p>That's too trusting. The world is celebrating the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, a reminder that governments can't always be counted on to respect the rights of citizens.</p>
<p>It is troubling when a drug dealer avoids trial because a police search violated his rights. But that's the trade we make for enshrining the rule of law and our own freedom from government messing in our lives.</p>
<p>Still. Pimm was speaking his mind. A lot of his constituents would likely share his views. That's good for an MLA. And not all that common.</p>
<p>MLAs and cabinet ministers, especially in government, tend to avoid saying anything.</p>
<p>Consider the example recently offered by Ida Chong, junior minister for healthy living. Two health officials in Alberta have been fired because the Calgary Flames jumped the queue for H1N1 flu vaccinations.</p>
<p>So Chong was asked whether the Vancouver Canucks would get special access to flu shots, ahead of vulnerable members of the public.</p>
<p>The answer should be easy. No, the vaccine would be provided based on health needs. A vulnerable five-year-old or pregnant woman would be protected before an incredibly fit professional hockey player.</p>
<p>But Chong instead, offered this response. "I believe that what is important is that those who need access to this vaccine to mitigate the possible spread will be looked at by our health experts," she said.</p>
<p>It was an easy question. On principle, should the survival of a child come before the playoff chances and profitability of a hockey team?</p>
<p>And Chong is no fool. But politicians are told to say nothing. And they do, even when it makes them look ridiculous.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm rooting for Pimm. The voters sent him down to the legislature to speak for them, based on his experience in business, community sports and municipal government. They know him.</p>
<p>He's wrong on the importance of the Charter, but at least he is saying what he thinks.</p>
<p>Imagine 85 MLAs, from all across the province, with different individual skills and experience and perspectives, debating and listening and learning from each other and really shaping government policy. Still committed to core party principles, but not blindly.</p>
<p>That's how our government is supposed to work. Our representatives, making decisions based on their best judgments about what is good for the people they represent.</p>
<p>Instead, MLAs sign up for their teams and do what they're told.</p>
<p>Footnote: You can judge the level of MLAs' independence.</p>
<p>The legislature sessions are televised, though they're off this week. Question period, about 1:50 p.m., offers a chance to assess their efforts and perhaps let them know what you think.</p>

<p>A panel of experts will review the care given to a Richmond woman who had H1N1 and died in hospital after two outpatient visits to the hospital, a spokeswoman for Vancouver Coastal Health said yesterday.</p>
<p>Doctors at the hospital sent Mae Mah, 51, home twice in two days before admitting her again later on the second day, Nov. 1, when she died after going into cardiac arrest, according to news reports.</p>
<p>Maureen Malanchuk, spokeswoman for Vancouver Coastal Health, said a review is standard procedure "whenever there is a situation like this where there has been a fatality and there's been a couple of visits to the hospital."</p>

</p>
<p>Swine-flu deaths in Europe doubled in three of the past four weeks, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control said.</p>
<p>Eighty-four people in 31 European Union and European Free Trade Association countries died from swine flu last week, compared with 43 the week before, Stockholm-based ECDC said in a bulletin on its website.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, 49 people died, up from 24 and 12 the previous weeks, the agency said.</p>
<p>"We are globally entering the acceleration phase" of the pandemic, Denis Coulombier, head of the ECDC's unit of preparedness and response, said in a phone interview Wednesday.</p>
<p>"We are heading toward the peak for sure."</p>
<p>The region's swine-flu outbreak has been most severe in northern countries such as Ireland, Iceland and the Ural region of Russia, according to the World Health Organization's regional office in Copenhagen. Norway, Sweden and the Netherlands are also experiencing significant levels of the illness, the WHO said in its Nov. 6 weekly report.</p>
<p>A total of 414 people in Europe have died from swine flu since the outbreak began in Mexico and the U.S. in April, ECDC said. The figure includes 155 deaths in the U.K., 73 in Spain, 31 in Italy and 30 in France since the beginning of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Almost 80 per cent of all swine-flu cases in Europe have occurred in people under 30 years of age, according to a risk assessment published by ECDC on Nov. 6.</p>
<p>"In the acceleration phase, it's not a surprise that the younger ones are the ones who are most contributing to the spread," Coulombier said. "It doesn't mean at the end of the wave you will have the same pattern."</p>
<p>ECDC was established five years ago by the European Union to assist its member states in responding to communicable diseases. Its statistics are probably "gross underestimates" because health-care systems, lab testing, surveillance and definitions used to identify cases vary across Europe and affect reporting, the agency said.</p>
<p>The Geneva-based WHO estimated Nov. 6 that 482,300 people worldwide have been sickened by the H1N1 virus that causes swine flu and 6,000 have died.</p>
<p>Russia has confirmed 4,560 cases of the disease, almost 4,000 of them since Oct. 6, the state public-health service Rospotrebnadzor said.</p>

<p>For those currently agonizing over how to maintain friendly social relations amidst the need to minimize handshakes to avoid spreading the H1N1 virus, relax. An elegant, age-old solution is at hand.</p>
<p>The next time someone greets you in public, simply clasp your hands together about chest high as in prayer, with your fingers pointing upward, and say: "Namaste."</p>
<p>This graceful form of welcome comes from India and over the millennia has been adopted throughout southeast Asia, east Asia and elsewhere as a traditional greeting wherever Indian culture has been prominent.</p>
<p>But this customary form of Indian greeting has a considerably deeper meaning than simply "Hello." In short, it means, "I salute you in your innermost being."</p>
<p>In a deeper sense, it means: "I honour the place in you in which the entire universe dwells. I honour the place in you which is of love, of truth, of light, and of peace. When you are in that place in you, and I am in that place in me, we are one." In short, it is a salutation between equals.</p>
<p>As we avoid spreading this virus, perhaps we can all learn to be more civil in our daily routines.</p>

<p>Following is the viewpoint of the writer, co-chair of the Saskatoon Anti-Poverty Coalition (SAPC).</p>
<p>Health-care workers, young children, pregnant women and new moms recently were priorized for vaccination against H1N1. This strategy excluded others who are also high risk due to chronic conditions of diabetes, asthma, cancer and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p>Statistically, most of these people are living in poverty.</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region's Health Disparity Report (2006) and the recent Health Status Report (2009) show that people with limited incomes have more chronic disease, higher infant mortality and lower life expectancy.</p>
<p>People who live in inadequate or overcrowded shelter are also at higher risk.</p>
<p>Our region initially vaccinated everyone who came to inner-city clinics. This practice also recognized that return trips are unaffordable to many.</p>
<p>While SAPC acknowledges that the Health Ministry and each health region are struggling with vaccine shortages, we urge that the high risk of poverty is immediately acknowledged and that all very low income people are again given access to the vaccine.</p>
<p>Health Canada and the provincial Health Ministry widely recommend that all citizens purchase preventive over-the-counter medications to help slow the spread of H1N1 and reduce costly visits to the doctor and or emergency room. However, the Social Services Ministry long has had a policy of not covering over-the-counter medications, even those prescribed by doctors.</p>
<p>By recommending such over-the-counter remedies as generic acetaminophen, pedialytes and cough syrup, Health Canada and the Health Ministry want all Saskatchewan citizens, especially those at highest risk, to have access to self-care that may prevent much suffering and likely save health-care costs.</p>
<p>The combined retail price of these generic medications would be about $26 for a three-week supply. These will be too expensive for all people on fixed very low incomes, but the cost won't be covered by Social Services.</p>
<p>We are calling on the Health Ministry to allow pharmacists or clinic nurses to direct bill the province for a three-week supply of these medications, or make bulk wholesale purchases for every clinic in Saskatchewan, to be provided to those who identify themselves as having a very low income.</p>

<p>H1N1 vaccination clinics began Nov. 3 with those in high-risk categories. Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq claims H1N1 vaccine is widely available to everyone who wants it.</p>
<p>Yet, people in Saskatoon's inner city are being turned away.</p>
<p>The Central Urban Métis Association's Shirley Isbister says, people had to be turned away because of restrictions, but these are the very families who, because of their poverty, are highly susceptible and need the vaccine.</p>
<p>That's quite a contrast to a Globe and Mail report about the Toronto client of a private medical facility, who said of her two young children: "No risk being turned away after a six-hour wait, there is no way I would take them to a (public) clinic. I don't want them to pick up 50 other things."</p>
<p>These kids' father has a corporate membership in Medcan, an elite, private clinic with a big dollar membership.</p>
<p>Appears to me that if kids are Métis, poor, live in Saskatoon's core they are less valuable than the Medican members' kids. Additionally, I read in The SP that a private firm, HealthServ, has acquired thousands of doses of H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>Why are the private, for-profit companies given special arrangements with a publicly funded vaccine? Medicare should be based on need, not on the ability to pay.</p>

</p>
<p>H1N1 immunizations in the Saskatoon Health Region have been expanded to include caregivers of infants, home-schooled children, immune-compromised people and adults 35 and younger with chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>Today, the shot will also be available to home-schooled kids and five-year-olds not attending school.</p>
<p>"We don't want vaccine sitting," says Karen Grauer, manager of disease control for public health in the region.</p>
<p>As soon as attendance at vaccine clinics begins tapering off for one risk group, she says, the region is anxious to make it available for other vulnerable groups. That now includes up to two caregivers for each child under six months of age.</p>
<p>Babies don't have mature enough immune systems to receive the vaccine, so the health region is attempting to protect them by targeting the adults who spend the most time with them. This also includes child-care workers who take care of babies younger than six months.</p>
<p>People with compromised immune systems now eligible for the vaccine include patients with chronic renal failure, on hemodialysis, with leukemia or lymphoma, those receiving chemotherapy or radiation, transplant recipients, people with HIV or AIDS, people with congenital immunodeficiency or those taking high doses of steroids or other drugs that suppress the immune system.</p>
<p>Grauer said the region is working on possibly setting up special clinics for immune-compromised people so they can avoid exposure to the sometimes large crowd of people lining up and working at the region's main vaccination site at Prairieland Park. For more information on these special clinics, once they're announced, check www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca[http://www.saskatoonhealthregion.ca].</p>
<p>People aged 35 and under who have chronic health conditions such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease are also now eligible for an H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>Grauer said the clinics are based on the honour system -- no doctor's note or proof of any of these conditions is required.</p>
<p>That honour system has worked well so far as the vaccine was initially just available to pregnant women, women who'd given birth in the past four weeks and children aged six months to five years, Grauer said.</p>
<p>"We were pleasantly surprised because we thought it would be tempting for parents to have their (other) children immunized," she said.</p>
<p>Starting Monday, vaccines began rolling into schools to immunize children from kindergarten to Grade 6.</p>
<p>At 15 schools, nurses immunized 1,717 kids Monday, which was about 60 per cent of those eligible. The region will still roll out the shots in 80 more schools. Any child in kindergarten to Grade 6 who missed the shot at school can also go to the region's main clinic in Hall E at Prairieland Park.</p>
<p>For a list of when each school is getting the vaccine, head to www.thestarphoenix.com[http://www.thestarphoenix.com].</p>
<p>Vaccinations are not yet available for children in grades 7 to 12, but those tweens and teens will likely be targeted before the vaccine opens up to the general public, Grauer said.</p>
<p>Although the health region's estimate changes frequently, based on the national vaccine supply, Grauer said Tuesday she now expects it will be about two more weeks before enough vaccine is available to begin immunizing the general public.</p>
<p>Also later this week, the health region should have data available on any adverse events from the shot. Grauer said at least two people in the health region have had serious allergic reactions to the vaccine and officials are investigating those cases. Neither reaction required hospitalization, she said.</p>
<p>The Prairieland Park clinic will be open from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. today and Friday, and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.</p>

<p>Question: Why was the program for the seasonal flu vaccinations stopped?</p>
<p>Answer: Seasonal flu shots were made available earlier this flu season at public health clinics to those who benefit most: residents 65 years of age and older, residents of long-term care facilities, pregnant women, children aged six to 23 months and residents with chronic health conditions.</p>
<p>These clinics were suspended as the H1N1 vaccination clinics began for two reasons: public health immunization resources were required to address the H1N1 vaccination program and H1N1 is the primary flu virus circulating in the community now.</p>
<p>Further lab testing of residents with the flu has further demonstrated that H1N1 is the only influenza virus that is circulating at this time. It is necessary to focus all available public health resources to ensure that all Saskatchewan residents have the opportunity to be immunized against H1N1 as the vaccine becomes available. Once the H1N1 vaccination program is complete -- likely mid-December -- seasonal flu vaccine will be available once again for those high-risk residents who wish to receive it. Those who are not considered high risk may be able to purchase the vaccine from a private provider such as a pharmacy or through their physician.</p>

<p>Jennifer Taylor's close monitoring of the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's website and pandemic hotline paid off Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>The 25-year-old has been eagerly waiting to get the H1N1 vaccination. On Monday, when she checked the region's website, she saw pandemic immunizations would be expanded in Regina on Tuesday to include several high-risk groups.</p>
<p>So at 8:30 a.m., Taylor was the first of eight people to line up at the former Robert Usher Collegiate to get her shot.</p>
<p>"I thought the lineup would be much longer than it is," she said. "I'm a Type 1 diabetic and I also have a thyroid condition, so between the two of those, I'm at high risk for contracting H1N1."</p>
<p>Determined to ward off the flu, Taylor religiously used hand sanitizer and washed her hands frequently.</p>
<p>She wasn't among the first to receive the H1N1 influenza vaccine, but she's pleased with Saskatchewan's approach to providing the vaccine to residents.</p>
<p>"Although it's been a slower rollout than places like Alberta, there's been more information throughout the process. And at least you know that when your group comes up, that there's not as much concern about a shortage of vaccine," Taylor said.</p>
<p>Greg Berner agrees.</p>
<p>"I think (Saskatchewan) is more organized than other provinces," he said. "When you hear about what's happening in Alberta, we haven't had that problem. It hasn't been a free-for-all."</p>
<p>The 24-year-old asthmatic took the morning off work so he could get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"I have asthma, so I figured as soon as the vaccine was available, I'd come and get it," Berner said. "I'm not too worried about getting H1N1. I've been taking precautions like coughing into my sleeve, avoiding people who are sick, using hand sanitizers, keeping my hands clean and never bringing my hands to my mouth -- standard procedure."</p>
<p>Still, Berner said he was relieved to be immunized.</p>
<p>"I know a few people who have had (H1N1)," he said. "They haven't had it too bad, but I figure with a lung condition I probably should (get vaccinated.)"</p>
<p>Further down the short line, Brenda Skiba wasn't among those in the high-risk category. As a donor services representative with Canadian Blood Services, Skiba could have been vaccinated earlier with other health-care workers, but she was sick.</p>
<p>"I had to quarantine myself for a few weeks," said the 51-year-old. "I got a secondary infection which turned into pneumonia. The doctor did not test me but he said he was certain that it was (H1N1)."</p>
<p>Skiba applauded the province's measured approach to rolling out the vaccine.</p>
<p>"It seems to be going in a smooth order and there's been no line-jumping as far as I know," she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Moira McKinnon, the province's chief medical health officer, announced Tuesday that the H1N1 flu vaccination campaign would expand across Saskatchewan. There are variations between health regions so residents are asked to check their region's local website.</p>
<p>In Regina, the following people will be able to receive H1N1 vaccinations this week at the former Robert Usher Collegiate:</p>
<p>- Severely immunocompromised individuals of all ages including patients on dialysis,</p>
<p>- Those undergoing chemotherapy or radiotherapy,</p>
<p>- People who are HIV positive or have AIDS</p>
<p>- Patients with leukemia/lymphoma as well as people with other severe immunodeficiency or on immunosuppressive therapy, and,</p>
<p>- Organ or stem-cell transplant recipients.</p>
<p>Also qualifying for the H1N1 shot now are people under 35 with underlying medical conditions such as chronic heart disease, diabetes, asthma and chronic lung disease, kidney disease, blood disorders, severe obesity, liver disease and those treated for long periods with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).</p>
<p>Primary caregivers (up to a maximum of two) of children under six months of age are also eligible to roll up their sleeves this week, as are day-care providers who care for children under the age of six months.</p>

caregivers for children under six months of age, were allowed their
shots on Tuesday.

<p>It was revealed this week that the City of Toronto recently bought hand sanitizer for all its employees at the mind-bending cost of $646,000. Put aside the fact that the city paid nearly 75% more than it needed to because it made a single-source deal with a wholesaler rather than putting out tenders directly with manufacturers. What business does a municipal government have buying personal pharmaceutical products for its workers in the first place?</p>
<p>This foolishness is yet another example of waste borne aloft by panic.</p>
<p>Providing sanitizer in public places -- municipal office waiting rooms, civic arena change rooms, public washrooms -- we could understand. But the sense of giving every Toronto city worker four bottles of antibacterial gel escapes us.</p>
<p>What health-related perks are next? Free vitamins during cold season, sun block on days with high UV ratings, bug spray for those fearful of contracting West Nile, and aspirin for workers whose clients are headaches? The health threat from H1N1 is real, but it shouldn't be used as a pretext for the state to take over the hygiene decisions of ordinary office workers. Getting rid of germs is a personal responsibility -- even in flu season.</p>

<p>LASALLE 5 ST. MARYS 4</p>
<p>The LaSalle Vipers of the Greater Ontario Junior Hockey League took to the ice Wednesday for the first time in game action since it became public knowledge that members of the organization got H1N1 flu vaccinations even though they weren't part of the government-issued, at-risk group that is given priority for the shots.</p>
<p>This was the Vipers' chance to explain.</p>
<p>To state their case.</p>
<p>To come clean.</p>
<p>Instead, they opted to stonewall.</p>
<p>To speak in lawyerspeak.</p>
<p>Vipers general manager Kevin McIntosh answered questions with questions.</p>
<p>He confirmed nothing.</p>
<p>He denied nothing.</p>
<p>He admitted that the club was informed that a player had been diagnosed with H1N1, but wouldn't say who that player was, how he was diagnosed with the virus, or who in fact it was that made the diagnosis, declining to even confirm whether it was a medical professional who issued the diagnosis.</p>
<p>They were willing to admit that steps were taken to confront and control the potential spread of the illness, such as sanitizing the dressing room and cancelling all personal appearances for players within the community.</p>
<p>But that was about as far as they were willing to open up.</p>
<p>McIntosh wouldn't even acknowledge the club had received the H1N1 vaccine, though he wouldn't deny it, either.</p>
<p>"Ethically, I don't feel I should reveal that information," McIntosh said before a 5-4 shootout victory over the St. Marys Lincolns.</p>
<p>A bit late to play the ethics card, don't you think?</p>
<p>Come on, guys.</p>
<p>Step up. Be accountable.</p>
<p>Do exactly what you ask of your players.</p>
<p>As is so often the case in amateur sports, it was left to the teenagers to show the adults that straightforward common sense is always the wisest course to pursue.</p>
<p>"I can only speak as a player, because I don't know what happened, or how it came about, but if we knew we were doing something wrong, we obviously wouldn't have done it," Vipers captain D.J. Turner said.</p>
<p>Turner, 19, was much more forthcoming when it came to discussing the situation, even while members of the club's management sat with him during the interview.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got a shot (for H1N1)," he confirmed.</p>
<p>Did he feel they jumped the queue?</p>
<p>"You don't have to answer questions if you don't want to answer a question," McIntosh quickly advised Turner.</p>
<p>"No, it's fine," Turner said. "Looking back now, maybe we have (jumped the queue). I don't know how it came about that we got the shots. Someone on our team was sick.</p>
<p>"Everyone feels that it's regrettable that it happened. It's not a positive thing. Now we understand why people are so upset."</p>
<p>A second-year student at the University of Windsor, Turner acknowledged that some players have been taking the needle from the general public over the shots they received.</p>
<p>"A couple of guys have heard some things from teachers and other kids at school," he said.</p>
<p>It's clear that the Vipers made a poor choice and in retrospect, likely realize it.</p>
<p>That being said, it was a mistake, a wrong decision made with the best of intentions.</p>
<p>Their thinking was to protect their players and anyone with a child playing minor sports would certainly hope the people who oversee those teams will always put player safety first on the agenda.</p>
<p>If only the Vipers recognized that by continuing to make the wrong decisions, they are simple making a bad situation worse.</p>
<p>"I'm sure everyone involved with it, if they'd known what was going to happen, they wouldn't have done it," Turner said.</p>
<p>The adults who run the Vipers need to realize this and do the right thing.</p>
<p>If they throw themselves on the mercy of the court of public opinion, it will be amazing how quickly all this will go away.</p>
<p>Until the Vipers do that, they'll continue to take shots.</p>

</p>
<p>The Ontario government is expanding the list of people who can get the H1N1 flu shot. The province's Chief Medical Officer of Health, Arlene King, said Tuesday that first responders -- firefighters and police officers -- can now get inoculated. Correctional workers and senior citizens living in nursing homes are also eligible to receive the vaccine.</p>
<p>For the past two weeks, the only people eligible for the shot were pregnant women, people under 65 with chronic conditions, children between the ages of six months and five years, as well as caregivers of those who can't be immunized.</p>
<p>Health units across the province were scheduled to receive additional shipments of the vaccine Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Windsor-Essex County Health Unit was closed Wednesday for Remembrance Day and a public H1N1 flu clinic wasn't held.</p>
<p>There will be a clinic today from 2 to 8 p.m. at the Essex County Civic Centre, 360 Fairview Ave. W. in Essex.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Erie St. Clair Local Health Integration Network, which co-ordinates the region's health care services, is asking people who are experiencing mild flu symptoms to avoid coming to emergency rooms, which have been dealing with a surge in patient volumes.</p>
<p>The LHIN says hospitals are trying to focus on those with serious symptoms, such as shortness of breath and chest pain, as well as other types of emergencies.</p>
<p>To reduce pressure on emergency departments, all local hospitals have either set up special flu assessment clinics or expanded their ERs during certain hours with extra physicians and staff.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doses made available to detainees</b>
</div><div>By Jonathan Montpetit   </div>

<div>410 words</div><div>11 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</p>
<p>As Canadians line up for dwindling supplies of H1N1 vaccine, Afghan detainees in Canadian custody will have doses made available to them with the same priority as soldiers.</p>
<p>Detainees being held at Kandahar Airfield will have the opportunity to be vaccinated beginning Wednesday, military officials say.</p>
<p>"That is something we are going to press forward with, at least offering whether or not they want the immunization," said Task Force Surgeon Cmdr. Rob Briggs.</p>
<p>Task Force Kandahar's medical staff recently sought legal advice on whether they should be offering the H1N1 flu vaccine to Afghans suspected of Taliban involvement who are being held by Canadians.</p>
<p>They were told that under Geneva Conventions, prisoners of war should receive the same treatment as Canadian soldiers.</p>
<p>"We have had a legal opinion that states, yes indeed, we should be offering - on a voluntary basis - detainees H1N1 (vaccinations) because it's being seen as a preventive measure," said Briggs.</p>
<p>However, the Afghans in Canadian custody have no legal status as prisoners of war. Canada considers the war in Afghanistan a counter-insurgency operation, the rules of which are not covered by the Geneva Conventions.</p>
<p>"But we treat the people we apprehend as detainees with the same level of treatment described as the Geneva Conventions," said Maj. Mario Couture, Task Force Kandahar's senior public affairs officer.</p>
<p>"We don't get entangled with words. We treat them with the highest level of care."</p>
<p>Back in Canada, meanwhile, vaccine shortages have hampered the country's largest-ever mass vaccination effort, causing long lineups at overcrowded clinics along with widespread confusion and frustration.</p>
<p>"I don't think it would be fair to compare the Canadian conditions and the Afghan conditions," said Couture.</p>
<p>Doses of the vaccine being made available to detainees will come from army stockpiles, according to Couture. He said the military had secured sufficient quantities of the vaccine several months ago and has enough to treat both detainees and soldiers.</p>
<p>Canadian soldiers started receiving their vaccinations more than a week ago, and more than 2,000 of the 2,800 troops stationed in Afghanistan have been immunized so far.</p>
<p>Couture said logistical complications, as well as the legal consultation, account for the delay in making the vaccine available to detainees. Both medical and military officials say they won't be surprised if few of the detainees opt to receive the shot.</p>

</p>
<p>Sing it, Bob.</p>
<p>Or croak it, or whatever that sound coming from your throat is.</p>
<p>Don't mind us. We'll just be sitting here, squinting from the very back row of this old hockey rink, knees banging on the heads of the guys in front of us, trying to figure out what the heck the guy in the big white hat way at the other end was saying.</p>
<p>Whatever he's saying, it must be important.</p>
<p>This was Bob Dylan, after all, and he was once a really big deal.</p>
<p>Who else could cause us to slap down $60 each to crowd into Kitchener's cavernous Aud, a Soviet-inspired place normally reserved for hockey-playing teenagers? We were trying to buy a piece of a legend, and we were eager to be pleased.</p>
<p>The night started out promising enough. We pulled up in the jammed parking lot, watching all those 50-something groupies falling out of Dodge Caravans and lining up outside the arena like NHLers waiting for the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>This was going to be good.</p>
<p>Walking into the rink, we heard music start up, and I figured from the sound some country-rock band led by an Inuit throat singer with a bad cold was warming up the crowd.</p>
<p>But no.</p>
<p>This wasn't the opening act, but the act - Dylan - showing us in awful clarity that times do a-change yer vocal chords.</p>
<p>You could practically hear the recession-weary crowd in this recession-weary town groan, "We paid what for this?"</p>
<p>One local reviewer later wrote that his "voice fell somewhere between a throat-clearing croak and a raspy growl."</p>
<p>I'd say that's being polite. I can't confirm it, but it's probable that every child within a quarter-mile of the Aud went running for their lives that night.</p>
<p>Other than the parts where he sang, it was a good set. The harmonica doesn't age, apparently. But Dylan's lyrics were indecipherable and when the song was widely known, he deliberately changed the delivery so much that the songs were unrecognizable.</p>
<p>If Dylan knew he was performing in front of an audience, he didn't show it. At one point, his leg shook a bit, but it may have been a twitch. At another point, after a 10-minute jam, the band wrapped it up, exhausted. The boss in the big white hat just glared at them, and awkwardly they started up again, and kept it going for another three minutes until he was ready to finish.</p>
<p>He seemed to ad lib his lyrics and pulled lines from dozens of songs to fill the space he needed. His only nod to the crowd was when he mumbled, "Thank you, my friends," while looking at his feet.</p>
<p>Dylan played for 95 minutes, and wrapped up with a whimper before 9:45 p.m. The whole thing was painful, especially for someone like this writer who holds the 68-year-old songwriter in such high esteem.</p>
<p>And then the swooning came. People were tripping over themselves to say nice things. If you didn't swoon, you're not a real fan. If you didn't cry, you're probably dead inside. That same reviewer who panned the voice also quoted a lineup of people gushing over the performance.</p>
<p>Right. But we've got ears, and they were working just fine on Saturday night. And so was our sense of being ripped off.</p>
<p>We know Dylan was always a reluctant icon in the spotlight, but you couldn't help the feeling that we were the ones getting exploited that night.</p>

</p>
<p>There used to be a joke regarding local TV news in Buffalo. If you wanted to learn about another house fire in Cheektowaga – tune in to Channel 4 news.</p>
<p>Lately, we have been inundated by TV commercials regarding local television and its importance. But let’s face it, the only thing we are really talking about is the local evening news. And in my opinion, they are doing a terrible job.</p>
<p>Whereas most national news outlets are smart enough to simply report the news with a minimum of editorial commentary, our local TV station has time and again presented a slanted view of Canadian politics.</p>
<p>Please understand that I like editorials as long as they are presented as such or allow some form of rebuttal.</p>
<p>I complained to Elections Canada about a comment made by an assistant news director on the local evening news. As part of his evening newscast, he joked that then prime minister Paul Martin was taking kickbacks - in the middle of an election campaign. That complaint led to a call and a meeting with the station’s general manager.</p>
<p>While I was waiting to meet with him, I happened to mention the election to the receptionist. I was treated to a three-minute diatribe against the Liberals and Paul Martin in particular.</p>
<p>That same assistant news director still hosts a weekly talk show which consistently bashes all things Liberal. I had to stop watching that program.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong - all opinions are important, but to offer those opinions as facts without any form of rebuttal diminishes the credibility of all local TV stations.</p>
<p>I normally read two newspapers daily - and, obviously, this one is among them. I also read a Wellington County newspaper on a weekly basis.</p>
<p>Recently, the lead political story in the national daily I read was about the assertion of five doctors, who are part of official Opposition, that the federal government is doing a terrible job getting the H1N1 vaccinations to the public. The story included a detailed timeline showing that both the U.S. and Great Britain had ordered the vaccine more than three months before Canada.</p>
<p>Interestingly, none of this was included in the evening newscast. They didn’t even mention it. And the national newspaper I speak of and the TV station are both owned by the same conglomerate.</p>
<p>While I am not one to encourage false hysteria in the media, I get tired of hearing the federal minister of health saying the same two-sentence scripted response to the current situation over and over and over again. And then to blame the manufacturer of the vaccine for the slow roll-out is, to me, pure political spin.</p>
<p>Local TV stations have to realize that when they side with one political party so completely, they are effectively alienating all those people who did not vote for that party. And they wonder why local ad revenues are down.</p>
<p>And that’s why I get my local news from newspapers.</p>

<p>If cleanliness is next to godliness, Canadians are in the midst of a religious experience.</p>
<p>Not since the SARS scare has there been such a national obsession with infection prevention, from the hand sanitizers in our classrooms to the disinfectants in our homes. Overkill or not, many are hoping the trend will shake up any latent complacency around hygiene, and lead to long-lasting behavioural changes - much the same way the economy is fundamentally altering spending habits.</p>
<p>"I think patterns have not only changed in response (to H1N1), but that they'll remain changed for quite a while," said John Gaiptman, superintendent of schools for Greater Victoria. "Hygiene has become the norm."</p>
<p>Since April, the school district has invested more than $50,000 in some 800 hand-sanitizer dispensers and hand sanitizers - products that in recent weeks have become as ubiquitous as the apprehension that likely inspired their purchase.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Disney</span> World ordered 200,000 hand sanitizers for its properties; Clorox recently revealed that demand for disinfectants led to a 23-per-cent increase in first-quarter earnings; and Nielsen reports that in the 24 weeks ending Oct. 3, dollar sales of hand sanitizers were up more than 70 per cent, to $118.4 million U.S., over the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Canadians' heightened alert is especially evident in public places.</p>
<p>The percentage of time that doctors and nurses followed hand-washing protocol at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario has more than doubled, to 83 per cent, since March. And <span class="companylink">Dyson Canada</span>, whose Airblade hand dryers use hospital-grade air filters, is reporting a "significant" increase in inquiries from malls, airports and universities wanting to prevent contamination.</p>
<p>"If you don't fully dry your hands, you might as well not bother washing them," said Dyson microbiologist Danielle Stevens, noting that a wet or damp hand can transfer up to 1,000 times more bacteria to the first person or thing touched than a properly dried hand.</p>
<p>"Hand sanitizer makes people happy, but it doesn't solve the problem."</p>

<p>Dining Military Style</p>
<p>When soldiers are first told they are being sent to a war zone, what's on the menu while in the field is not likely top of mind. But for those in charge of keeping troops in good physical condition, it is. To provide hard-working soldiers with meals to meet their nutritional requirements, careful thought goes into what's provided and how it's packaged.</p>

<p>With swine flu on the rise and winter on its way, workplaces all over the country are crossing their fingers that employees get the vaccine and updating their corporate plans in anticipation of greater employee absenteeism.</p>
<p>But while phone trees and emergency protocols are important, there's a lot that can be done on a daily basis to ward off bugs at work and maintain business as usual throughout the coming months.</p>
<p>Jan Chappell, a senior technical specialist with the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, explains that regular employee hand-washing is crucial.</p>
<p>"People get wound up but really, it's just the normal, everyday stuff that you have to do," she says.</p>
<p>While Chappell isn't aware of any data suggesting a certain frequency of hand washing, doing it with some regularity--and always after sneezing, eating or using the toilet -- should suffice. Regular soap and warm water, or gel sanitizers, will get the job done. Like many workplaces, her office has placed a number of dispensers on the walls for easy access.</p>
<p>Because the H1N1 virus travels about one to two metres every time an infected person sneezes or coughs, it's ideal to place workstations at least two metres apart. Ensuring the air in the office is properly ventilated is also important, says Chappell.</p>
<p>Microorganisms often congregate on phones and other shared surfaces and Chappell suggests periodically wiping down these areas, especially if you share a workstation.</p>
<p>While she doesn't condemn handshakes at work, use discretion. "You can still greet people and be very nice about it, but I think if you're a little bit sick, even with a cold, you should say, 'Sorry, I have a cold,' " says Chappell.</p>
<p>Just as absenteeism can cause serious productivity losses, so can presenteeism. Sick employees really do need to stay home--especially those who are just starting to have symptoms. People are most contagious about eight hours before they come down with the flu, when they're just beginning to feel under the weather, she says. "There's toughing it out and then there's sharing the joy."</p>
<p>As far as office cleaning protocols go, there shouldn't be a need to do anything beyond the usual janitorial methods, says Chappell. "It's really behaving like a regular flu virus-- it's just new, so more people will get sick. But it's not an abnormal virus in the way it behaves."</p>
<p>However, Peter Sheldon, vice-president (operations) of Coverall Health-Based Cleaning Systems, believes that not all cleaning methods are equal. He says his company specializes in busting germs in commercial spaces. In his view, certain cleaning strategies can greatly reduce the spread of H1N1 at work.</p>
<p>"In today's world, things have changed. Twenty years ago, we didn't think about organisms coming into the workplace that could potentially kill us," says Sheldon. He says he's not interested in fear mongering but hopes to "educate people to take a defensive posture about potential threats."</p>
<p>Sheldon recommends companies talk to their janitorial service to ensure they're taking certain precautions, including: using hospital-grade antibacterial/disinfectant cleaning products, microfibre cleaning cloths, and flat mops rather than conventional string mops.</p>
<p>Certain cleaning techniques are also more effective in reducing cross-contamination, says Sheldon. Singledip flat mopping keeps clean water from being contaminated--simply moving around the dirt and germs from room to room.</p>
<p>Because restrooms can be "ground zero for disease transmission," Sheldon suggests no-touch spray and vacuum cleaning, which involves the use of a low-pressure stream of water, chemical injector, wet vac and high-pressure rinse.</p>
<p>Health-based cleaning is generally more efficient, says Sheldon, and shouldn't cost more than traditional cleaning strategies. "You can't ever eliminate the unseen world. It's always been here and always will be, but you can put yourself in a position to minimize the risks."</p>
