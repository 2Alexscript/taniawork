<div id="hd"><b>Canada sees first case of severe flu</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

<p>A young Edmonton child was in intensive care yesterday with the first known case of severe illness related to human swine influenza in Canada.</p>
<p>The child has no known connection to Mexico, and federal health officials said yesterday they did not know whether the girl had any underlying medical conditions that would increase her risk of flu-related complications.</p>
<p>"We are starting to see some community-based spread," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>Until now, all confirmed cases in Canada have been relatively mild, and all have made a full recovery.</p>
<p>"The news of this first, more severe case, although disconcerting, is not surprising, and it does not change the course of action," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>A total of 41 new confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus were reported in Canada yesterday, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 140.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said the number of global cases stands at 1,085 from 21 countries, including 26 deaths.</p>
<p>The new Canadian cases include 10 in B.C., six in Alberta, 17 in Ontario, including a four-year-old child, one in New Brunswick, five in Nova Scotia and two in Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>None of the new B.C. cases are on Vancouver Island, where swine flu has been diagnosed in six women.</p>
<p>The 10 new cases of swine flu in B.C. have raised the total number to 39 provincewide.</p>
<p>Three of the new cases are students at Decker Lake Elementary School near Burns Lake.</p>
<p>Of the 39 confirmed B.C. cases, only two have required hospital treatment, said Dr. Danuta Skowronski, an influenza and respiratory-illness epidemiologist with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>One hospital admission was for an overnight observation and the other "is recovering well," Skowronski said yesterday.</p>
<p>Skowronski said the cases so far have been less severe than the strains of human flu that put up to 70,000 Canadians in hospital every flu season and kill 4,000 to 7,000 people annually.</p>
<p>"We haven't seen the kinds of hospitalizations or death rates that have been witnessed in Mexico," she said.</p>
<p>"It's still quite a nasty illness."</p>
<p>H1N1 targets mainly healthy young adults ages 25 to 40. The eldest patient so far in Canada has been in his mid-50s, she said.</p>
<p>Decker Lake Elementary School was closed Friday after the absentee rate reached a threshold for reporting the situation to public health officials, Eryn Collins of Northern Health said.</p>
<p>He said more cases of swine flu, with varying levels of severity, will be uncovered, and the rogue virus is following the pattern of normal, seasonal influenza.</p>

<p>Hog producers are worried more countries may ban Canadian pork over an H1N1 influenza A outbreak on a central Alberta pig farm, creating another blow for the industry.</p>
<p>Pork producers in Canada and the U.S. are already seeing a loss of $10 to $20 per animal, due to the swine flu outbreak in Mexico last month, said Jurgen Preugschas, president of the Canadian Pork Council.</p>
<p>With China now banning Alberta pork, and more than a dozen countries banning Canadian pork and live hogs, the worry is how Canada's export-dependent industry is going to fare.</p>
<p>In question period yesterday, federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz warned the government could pursue World Trade Organization action if China doesn't end its ban.</p>
<p>Preugschas emphasized that H1N1 influenza A isn't a food safety issue, but one of human health.</p>
<p>Japan and the U.S., Canada and Alberta's biggest customers, aren't on the ban list.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pick up some pork, Ritz urges Canadians -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch   </div>

</p>
<p>THE federal agriculture minister wants Canadians to help out hog producers who are suffering a market downturn in the wake of an international outbreak of H1N1 flu -- also called swine flu.</p>
<p>"We are encouraging Canadian families to support struggling hog producers by picking up some pork next time they go to the grocery store," Gerry Ritz said in a statement Monday, following news that hogs on an Alberta farm had caught the virus from a farmhand who had been to Mexico.</p>
<p>It was a message reminiscent of the rallying cry in support of beef producers during the mad cow crisis in 2003, when many countries closed their borders to Canadian products.</p>
<p>Manitoba hog producers are worried that a nervous public will shy away from eating pork despite assurances from local, national and international health agencies that humans can't get the H1N1 flu strain from eating pork products.</p>
<p>"The issue is uncertainty," said Andrew Dickson, general manager of the Manitoba Pork Council, an industry lobby group, noting that a number of foreign markets have already banned North American pork because of the flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Hog producers saw prices fall by $10 to $20 a pig in recent days before word got out that the virus had spread to an Alberta swine farm. On Monday, American cash prices tumbled, in part because of the Alberta case, Dickson said.</p>
<p>So far, only three of Canada's top 15 export customers have put restrictions on Canadian pork, said Martin Rice, executive director of the Canadian Pork Council. Ukraine and the Philippines have barred Canadian products, while South Korea has begun lengthy tests on all shipments.</p>
<p>The news is much better here at home, where a local spokesman for Canada <span class="companylink">Safeway</span> said the company has not changed its buying practices in light of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"We haven't adjusted ordering or seen any decrease in sales," said John Graham.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Some Brandon students staying home - Manitoba swine flu case sparks fear</b>
</div><div>By Lindsey Wiebe   </div>

</p>
<p>Classes were in session, but close to a third of the students stayed away Monday from the Brandon school attended by Manitoba's first H1N1 flu victim.</p>
<p>Brandon School Division superintendent Donna Michaels said around 90 out of 320 students stayed home from Riverheights School, a kindergarten to Grade 8 school in the western Manitoba city.</p>
<p>That works out to an absentee rate of about 28 per cent, compared to a normal rate of eight to 10 per cent.</p>
<p>"Given the circumstances, I'm not alarmed," said Michaels. "Neither am I surprised."</p>
<p>A girl who attends Riverheights has a mild case of the H1N1 virus, also known as swine flu, the first and only reported case in Manitoba to date.</p>
<p>Provincial health officials have said the girl travelled to Mexico, the United States and British Columbia in mid to late April, but did not need to be hospitalized. Health officials have said there is no need for the school to be closed.</p>
<p>Classes in Brandon would only be called off if there was a serious risk of contagion, said Michaels, and the division looks to Manitoba Health for that information.</p>
<p>"They are the professional health-care givers, and we're the professional educators," she said. "We must rely on and respect their judgment in these matters."</p>
<p>On Monday, the province clarified its protocol for closing any school due to an outbreak of influenza. It said that such closures would be directed by the education minister after consultation with the chief provincial public health officer or a regional medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, said the government was reacting to a case outside Manitoba where a school had been closed without the advice of a public health officer -- and the anticipation that similar pressures might be placed on schools here.</p>
<p>"At this point in time, to my knowledge and to the knowledge of all of our regional medical officers of health, there is no indication for public health reasons to close any schools in Manitoba," he said.</p>
<p>Kettner said no additional confirmed cases of H1N1 flu have been reported in the province although it's expected that more cases have occurred and will occur.</p>
<p>"Although it's looking more and more with every passing day that this H1N1 influenza is not as severe as some people feared it might be ... it's too early to draw that conclusion," he said.</p>
<p>Kettner said like other flu strains, individuals can reduce the likelihood of transmitting H1N1 by washing their hands and covering their cough. As well, they can cut down the chance of developing a severe illness from the flu by generally taking care of their health, such as eating right, getting enough sleep and exercise and taking care of chronic health conditions they may have.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, all schools in the Brandon division are set to remain open for the week.</p>
<p>Principals from around the Brandon School Division met Monday to talk about the division's emergency response plans. Michaels said there was some concern from Riverheights teachers about how far the flu might have spread, or how the student in question might be received by her classmates when she returns to school.</p>
<p>Michaels believes absent students will begin coming back by Wednesday.</p>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA, TORONTO, MONTREAL -- Federal officials yesterday challenged China's decision to quarantine travelling Quebec students at a provincial hotel and ban some Canadian pork products.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Ottawa reported that a young Alberta girl was in intensive care after developing Canada's first severe case of a virulent new flu. But late in the day, Alberta health officials said they weren't yet ready to classify the case as severe and suggested that other factors could have contributed to the girl's hospitalization.</p>
<p>The girl has no known connection to Mexico where the A H1N1 virus originated and where all but one of the deaths associated with the disease have been recorded.</p>
<p>“I know I speak for all Canadians when I say we wish her a speedy recovery,” federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq told a news conference. But, she said, it is no surprise that a Canadian has required hospitalization. “Cases of severe illness are to be expected with this outbreak.”</p>
<p>The number of confirmed H1N1 cases in Canada climbed to 140 yesterday. There were 17 new cases in Ontario, 10 in British Columbia, six in Alberta, five in Nova Scotia, two in Prince Edward Island and one in New Brunswick.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 25 Quebec students headed on a long-awaited overseas study program to learn Chinese ended up quarantined in a hotel in northeastern China.</p>
<p>Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said he has asked consular officials to meet with these Canadians to ensure that they are being well cared for. “And following that,” he said, “I have asked them to take steps and to approach the Chinese government to clarify the situation.”</p>
<p>The students, mostly from the University of Montreal but also from Laval University in Quebec City, were taken aside at a regional airport in Jilin province on Saturday and submitted to temperature checks.</p>
<p>David Ownby, director of the East Asian Studies Centre at the University of Montreal, who is overseeing the trip, said none of the students recorded a fever, according to the Chinese-Canadian teacher accompanying the group.</p>
<p>However, Chinese authorities later reported that one student registered a very slight fever of 37.3. Still, that student was not separated from the group.</p>
<p>The students, mostly in their early 20s, were initially taken to a university dorm and then transferred to a hotel, the Jingyue, or Starmoon Inn, in the city of Changchun.</p>
<p>The quarantine appears to be the initiative of local officials in Jilin province. Patrick Desbiens, one of the Quebeckers, wrote on his trip blog that when the students landed in Beijing, they cleared customs quickly. “The Chinese aren't really stressed” about the flu, he wrote Saturday. The students just had to fill out health forms handed out by the Chinese government, he wrote.</p>
<p>In his latest entry on Sunday, however, Mr. Desbiens wrote that the students were required to have their temperature taken three times a day – at 6 a.m., noon and 6 p.m. They have been told they will remain in quarantine for a week. They are allowed outside the hotel onto the grounds and have not been kept separate from hotel staff, Prof. Ownby said. The Chinese embassy did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>China is one of about a dozen countries that have banned imports of Alberta pork or live hogs after a herd of pigs in that province was confirmed to have been infected with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Stockwell Day, Canada's Minister of International Trade, called China's move “disappointing and unwarranted.”</p>
<p>But Bob Rae, the Liberal Foreign Affairs critic, told Parliament the response by Mr. Day did not go far enough. “I think the decision by the Chinese government is something the Canadian government needs to fight back on,” he said. “It's more than disappointing, Mr. Speaker. It's illegal.”</p>
<p>Gerry Ritz, the federal Agriculture Minister, agreed. “We are looking for clarification as to why they have gone as far as they have,” he said. “We will have a response on that back very shortly. And should they continue on, of course, there is the WTO challenge which we would not hesitate to enact.”</p>
<p>Gerald Hauer, Alberta's Chief Provincial Veterinarian, said yesterday that flu viruses commonly move through hog barns without quarantines or culls. But because this is a novel strain, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and the Public Health Agency of Canada are deciding whether 2,200 pigs in central Alberta should be slaughtered.</p>
<p>“It's a very complex question to answer. People are working through it. I can't even pretend I know what the answer is going to be,” Dr. Hauer said.</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people worldwide have fallen ill with the new swine influenza virus, but global health authorities don't plan on raising the pandemic alert system to its highest level because there is no evidence of sustained community-level outbreaks outside of North America.</p>

</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>apicard@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Canada's response to the potential swine flu pandemic of 2009 began, fittingly enough, with the late-night buzz of a BlackBerry.</p>
<p>Frank Plummer, scientific director of the National Microbiology Laboratory, was relaxing in his Winnipeg home, half-watching a hockey game, when an e-mail arrived from Celia Alpuche Aranda, head of the Mexican national microbiology lab. She was concerned about an ever-worsening outbreak of atypical pneumonia that scientists there were unable to identify.</p>
<p>Earlier that day – Friday, April 17 – the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had alerted the World Health Organization to a seemingly unconnected occurrence: two unrelated children diagnosed with swine flu in California.</p>
<p>Dr. Aranda packed up samples from 51 seriously ill people in Mexico and shipped them to Winnipeg. She sent a similar package to the CDC in Atlanta.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the flu hunters – the nickname given the epidemiologists and laboratory scientists who obsessively track the permutations of wily influenza viruses – were already at work.</p>
<p>While they usually toil invisibly, doing everything from mucking about farms in China wringing the necks of ducks to pulling all-nighters with genetic sequencers, their most powerful tool remains the gathering of information, pieced together like a puzzle.</p>
<p>Epidemiological information-gathering has become much easier with instant communication tools like e-mail. But cyberspace also poses the greatest challenge, because information – and fear – spreads a lot more quickly than a virus ever could, even one with pandemic potential.</p>
<p>Before Dr. Aranda's samples arrived in Winnipeg, the blogosphere was aflame.</p>
<p>On April 21, ProMed-mail, the blog of choice for flu hunters, posted a long item about swine influenza A H1N1, the virus identified in the California children, ominously noting the “possibility that human transmission of this new influenza virus has occurred.”</p>
<p>Public health officials were also watching, with increased concern, an outbreak of flu in Mexico, a favourite vacation destination of Canadians. The Global Public Health Intelligence Network, an initiative of the Public Health Agency of Canada, sent out its first dispatch about an acute respiratory syndrome in Veracruz, Mexico, on April 10 and within days it was abuzz.</p>
<p>While there was no increase in flu activity in Canada, both the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion and the B.C. Centre for Disease Control sent alerts to public health units on April 21 telling them to watch for respiratory symptoms in Canadian travellers returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>Journalistic antennae went up too. Helen Branswell, the medical reporter at The Canadian Press, posted one of the first stories. “U.S. public health authorities are investigating two cases of swine flu in unrelated children in California, a development that has officials in Canada and elsewhere on alert,” she wrote presciently.</p>
<p>On April 22, the CDC announced three more swine flu cases in the United States, and the Canadian Public Health Agency began investigating reports of Canadians returning from Mexico with a strange respiratory ailment. The initial fear was that SARS had returned.</p>
<p>But on the morning of April 23, Dr. Plummer, whose team had worked around the clock to analyze the samples it had received the day before, held a conference call with top Mexican health officials to reveal his findings: 17 of the 51 samples contained a completely new type of virus, one that had originated in pigs – swine influenza A H1N1.</p>
<p>In Canada, provincial health officials sent out a far more detailed alert, this time to physicians, about travellers returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>The arrival of a new flu virus, one that had eerie similarities to the killer Spanish flu of 90 years ago, told David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, that it was time to activate the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization also kicked it up a notch. A mere 22 minutes after receiving the results of the Canadian testing, the WHO opened its emergency operations centre. It also made the first explicit connection between the “influenza-like illness in the U.S. and Mexico” and convened a panel of international experts to determine the threat that swine influenza A H1N1 posed.</p>
<p>The pandemic alert level was already set at three on the six-rung ladder (representing none or very limited human-to-human transmission) because of the ever-present risk posed by avian influenza A H5N1, which continues to flare up sporadically around the world. That scale, which is a barometer of future risk of a pandemic (it does not reflect current severity), soon jumped to level four, then five.</p>
<p>Travellers carried the swine flu from Mexico to the far reaches of the world – by last Sunday, cases had been reported in 17 countries on five continents – but fear travelled far more quickly and widely.</p>
<p>While the news moved through cyberspace on a 24/7 news cycle, the public was able to follow the steady spread and rise in swine flu numbers. The genome of the influenza A H1N1 virus was decoded in record time, revealing that it consists of a strange hybrid of North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza and swine influenza typically found in Asia and Europe.</p>
<p>One of the first things scientists at the CDC in Atlanta and the NML in Winnipeg did was start growing seed stock from the virus, the fundamental element needed for a vaccine. Production of the vaccine could begin in mid-May; a final product could be on the market within four months, and about two billion doses produced within a year.</p>
<p>While not many of the swine-flu hunters are getting their hands dirty on hog farms, there is no shortage of grunt work.</p>
<p>A group of North American scientists – including four lab workers from the National Microbiology Laboratory – essentially built a new lab from scratch in Mexico City so they no longer have to send samples to Canada and the United States for testing. It was up and running on April 26. That has greatly speeded up testing, but has also given the impression that the virus continues to spread quickly in Mexico, which is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>The laboratory work is also providing important clues on the epidemiology of the disease. It revealed that the first case of influenza A H1N1 occurred in Mexico on March 17, and the first case in the United States on March 28. The first death from swine flu was a 39-year-old woman who died on April 12 in Oaxaca, a popular tourist area. On that same day, a farm worker who had just returned from holidays in Mexico is believed to have infected pigs on a farm in Alberta.</p>
<p>This data is a comfort to flu hunters because it reveals that the virus has actually been circulating for about six weeks, meaning that many more people in Mexico (as well as travellers to the country) have been exposed to the virus than previously believed, without falling ill.</p>
<p>In coming days, information will be published on the fatality rate and severity of the flu to date, which will provide hard data for modelers and risk assessors to better determine where the pandemic may or may not be going.</p>
<p>Still, in our impatient world, there is not always a willingness to give the flu hunters the time to do their painstaking work. Nor is there, in the BlackBerry age, a recognition that influenza, an ancient disease, moves at its own pace, more often than not slowly and relentlessly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Q AND A: IT'S NO PARTY</p>
<p>How contagious is the swine flu and how does it compare to other diseases?</p>
<p>To measure how contagious an infectious disease is, scientists use a measure called the “basic reproductive rate” (R0 or R-zero for short) – the average number of people a disease carrier infects. To date, swine influenza A H1N1 appears to have an R0 of 1.5-2, which is quite low. By comparison, seasonal influenza has an R0 of 1.5-3, SARS was 2-5, polio 5-7 and measles 12-18.</p>
<p>However, one should not be lulled into complacency by the fact that swine flu is not very contagious. The Spanish flu, the biggest killer of all time, had an R0 in the range of 1.2-3. Diseases that spread slowly and methodically like the flu tend to sicken and kill a lot more people than those that spread rapidly and burn out.</p>
<p>In an earlier Q & A, you wrote that “people who are infected with swine influenza A H1N1 will have immunity, or at least partial immunity, should there be a full-fledged pandemic.” Pandemics tend to come in waves, the second worse than the first. So would it not make sense for healthy individuals to expose themselves to the flu to obtain some degree of immunity, trading a week of misery for protection against a possible more virulent second wave?</p>
<p>People raised in pre-immunization times will recall that mothers often staged chicken-pox parties so all the kids in the neighbourhood would contract the disease at once and get it over with. That was an effective (but slightly cruel) way of building lifelong immunity. However, holding a swine-flu party would be imprudent, for a number of reasons. The flu can be nasty; even a mild case can mean a week of fever, coughing and diarrhea. Second, there is no guarantee you will get a mild case of swine flu, even if you are infected by someone with a mild case. Influenza can be fatal and A H1N1 seems to hit kids particularly hard. Third, flu viruses mutate; if you deliberately get infected with a circulating strain of swine flu now, you may have only a little immunity later in a pandemic – so you get twice the misery. Finally, at and this is minor by comparison, is the aesthetics. At chicken-pox parties, kids got to play and the highly infectious virus did its work silently. At a swine-flu party, you would be dependent on a feverish, miserable host with the runs coughing on everyone – and you might also have to watch the slideshow from his Mexican vacation. If there is a vaccine for swine influenza A H1N1, will it be administered at the same time as the regular flu shot?</p>
<p>Preparations for the seasonal influenza vaccine that will be administered in the fall of 2009-10 are already well under way. It will take four to six months to develop a swine-flu vaccine, so it will not be added to the seasonal shot. If the swine flu becomes a serious threat, a vaccine could be produced urgently, but separately, and administered before the seasonal flu shots or at the same time. It is also possible that if the new flu virus continues to cause mostly mild disease, there will be no vaccination program.</p>

</p>
<p>Over the past two weeks, the global public-health establishment has treated the world to the unseemly spectacle of what is ultimately another pandemic false alarm. What happened?</p>
<p>In late April, we received reports of deaths, predominantly in younger people, from a new strain of influenza in Mexico. This is how new influenza pandemics are expected to start, so this information was initially very concerning.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization upgraded its pandemic alert to phase 4. Public health authorities in Canada and other countries began to launch pandemic plans. News stories about “swine flu” and an unfolding pandemic dominated front pages and television pundits brought dire warnings.</p>
<p>Then we began to get better information. The initial Mexican death count – fewer than 150 – was tiny compared with the 20,000 to 200,000 deaths that could be expected there during an influenza pandemic. Most importantly, the daily count was not rising exponentially. Returning travellers were not becoming seriously ill.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding, on April 29, WHO director-general Margaret Chan raised the alert level to phase 5 and declared that it is “all of humanity that is under threat from a pandemic.” The Public Health Agency of Canada advised against travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>It now appears that this new virus has been infecting people in Mexico since early March – almost two months. The illness has probably already infected millions of Mexicans and many visitors, but it has been almost uniformly mild. Some Mexicans developed a more severe version, but they were almost certainly only a tiny proportion of the total number of cases.</p>
<p>The perceived pandemic threat is melting away under the scrutiny of better information. It is difficult to predict the future of this new H1N1 influenza virus. It may simply fade away, or it may become established as a new seasonal strain. In any case, it is clearly not a threat to “all humanity.”</p>
<p>Many commentators have begun to look for a face-saving exit strategy. Some are warning that the virus could mutate and return stronger in the fall. But there is no scientific basis for this speculation.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that false alarm bells have sounded. In 1976, a highly touted swine flu epidemic failed to spread. Severe acute respiratory syndrome was supposed to cause a devastating pandemic but didn't. Since 2004, we have faced an interminable series of alarms about the imminent danger of H5N1 – bird flu – usually from the same voices that have been so prominent in the past two weeks. But that pandemic hasn't happened either.</p>
<p>There are very real costs to these false alarms. Look at the damage to Mexico's vital tourism industry. In 2003, Canada protested long and hard against the WHO's SARS travel advisory. But the Public Health Agency of Canada barely hesitated before making a similar assault on Mexico. This is wrong.</p>
<p>Frightening people without due cause is inherently bad. Confidence in the credibility of public-health authorities will suffer. Will people still believe us when a real crisis emerges?</p>
<p>The risk of a future influenza pandemic deserves our respect, but it should not cause us to live in fear. Pandemics are not usually catastrophic events. The most recent – 1957 and 1968 – were almost indistinguishable from annual seasonal influenza. The 1918 pandemic was more serious, but the world is a very different place now.</p>
<p>What are the lessons from this latest false alarm?</p>
<p>First and foremost, we should act on the basis of good information and analysis, not fears and preconceptions. There is no shame in backing down from an alarm when our understanding of the evidence changes. Give the public a balanced view as the facts emerge.</p>
<p>Second, our response needs to be commensurate with the threat. The damage done by travel advisories, futile traveller screening and persistent alarmist pronouncements is wholly gratuitous.</p>
<p>And, finally, we need to calm down. Obesity, tobacco addiction, climate change, poverty and nuclear war – these are the real public-health threats to all humanity. Influenza is not.</p>

<div>THE ECONOMIC CRISIS</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Investors flock to stocks as market sees some good news; Outnumbered optimists seeing support for sunnier outlooks with uptick in U.S. housing, banking and manufacturing</b>

<p>Is the winter of our discontent finally over?</p>
<p>With the smell of a nascent economic recovery in the air, investors around the world flocked to stocks – erasing heavy losses accumulated earlier this year. They also jumped back into the Canadian dollar and a handful of other currencies to capitalize on what they expect will be higher oil and commodity prices in the months ahead.</p>
<p>The triggers for the spurt of optimism, which has been growing in recent weeks as markets eye the “green shoots” of recovery, came from the very sources at the heart of the stress over the past several months: banking, U.S. housing and China's manufacturing sector.</p>
<p>Slowly but surely, people are coming back to the U.S. housing market; consumer spending is showing signs of life; credit spreads are improving; corporations are finding it easier to obtain financing in the capital markets; merger and acquisition activity has picked up; and the massive Chinese government stimulus appears to be working.</p>
<p>Equity players have been betting on an economic recovery since early March, driving share prices higher around the globe. And now they have fresh evidence that the glimmer at the end of the tunnel may not be another economy-wrecking train heading their way.</p>
<p>Many observers still think what we are witnessing is a classic bear-market rally in the middle of a prolonged slump.</p>
<p>But the outnumbered optimists, including famed stock bargain-hunter Warren Buffett, have steadfastly maintained their sunnier view of the economic future. And the latest data offers some tangible support for their outlook.</p>
<p>“The market may be overstating the economic case, but there are fundamental reasons for the improvement,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist with <span class="companylink">Moody's</span> Economy.com. “I think a bottom for the economy is coming into view, and investors are responding to that.”</p>
<p>The economy is still mired in recession, but “it seems to be taking on a brighter hue,” Mr. Zandi said. “It's just a mélange of things that are a bit better than they had been.”</p>
<p>The positive signals yesterday included a rise in sales of existing U.S. homes in March, after months of decline. U.S. construction spending also rose unexpectedly. It was only a 0.3-per-cent gain, but that beat the consensus estimate of minus 1.6 per cent and marked the first move into positive territory since last September.</p>
<p>Another market-boosting number came out of China, where a key survey showed that manufacturing output expanded in April thanks to increased domestic consumption. The number of jobs in the sector also rose slightly for the first time in nine months. The news was enough to propel markets throughout Asia and firm up prices for oil, copper and other metals and materials required for the Chinese manufacturing machine.</p>
<p>Buoyed by the higher commodity prices and renewed demand for financial stocks, the benchmark Toronto index reached a six-month high yesterday, and the Canadian dollar soared to its best level since early November. U.S. stocks also rose sharply. The S&P 500 Index has climbed 34 per cent since March 9. Last year, the benchmark U.S. stock index did not rise at all.</p>
<p>The leading global stock index has also erased its 2009 losses, which means that a dollar invested in the index on Jan. 1 is finally worth a dollar again. Even in Mexico, which is facing the economic fallout from the A H1N1 flu outbreak, the key stock gauge jumped 5 per cent yesterday.</p>
<p>But does the market revival signal an imminent recovery? Not if history is any guide.</p>
<p>Stocks rallied early in the Great Depression as well, only to slide even lower when it became apparent that the economy would remain stuck in reverse. And the stock market improved markedly long before the recessions of 1981-82 and 1991 reached a conclusion.</p>
<p>“The markets don't mirror what people are seeing in the economy,” said Arthur Heinmaa, managing partner with Toron Capital Markets in Toronto. “They're a discounting mechanism, so they're looking forward.”</p>
<p>Mr. Buffett, who in 2008 suffered through by far the worst year of his fabled investing career, is definitely looking forward.</p>
<p>“In the short term, things are going to be tough for a while,” he said in a television interview after wrapping up his company's celebrated annual meeting in Omaha, Neb. “We see no real pickup in a whole variety of businesses we have, but they'll be doing fine in a few years.”</p>
<p>More bearish analysts have been warning that things are going to get much worse before they get better.</p>
<p>“People used to say that the stock market predicted 12 out of the last nine recessions,” said New York University economics professor Nouriel Roubini, who comes by his nickname, Dr. Doom, honestly. “This time, it predicted six out of the last zero economic recoveries. Every time there was a rally, and then the macro news, the earning news, the financial news was worse, and the market touched a new low.”</p>
<p>But others say the markets already took into account the worst-case scenarios during the long slide last fall and winter.</p>
<p>“When the market was down until March, it was pricing in the ugliness that's about to hit the economy now,” Mr. Heinmaa said.</p>
<p>Lest anyone get the wrong idea that the worst is definitively over, this Friday's U.S. employment numbers ought to inject a strong dose of realism, analysts said. Most economists expect them to be dreadful, with perhaps another 700,000 jobs evaporated in April and the official jobless rate hitting 9 per cent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Zandi said, “I think that will be the last really bad number that we get out of this downturn.”</p>

<p>Written by Enda Walsh</p>
<p>Starring Richard Greenblatt</p>
<p>and Cathy Murphy</p>
<p>At the Tarragon Studio Upstairs</p>
<p>in Toronto</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Enda Walsh's Bedbound fits the mandate of independent theatre company MackenzieRo so well, it seems a wonder it took them six years to do it.</p>
<p>Founders Autumn Smith and Cathy Murphy pride themselves on presenting works by “in-yer-face Irish playwrights” that are “provocative, intimate and psychologically demanding.” Bedbound is nothing if not all those things.</p>
<p>The production follows on two critically successful Toronto stagings of Disco Pigs – the best-known play by the Dublin-born, Cork-based Walsh – in 2007 and 2008. Both plays had previously been award-winners at the Edinburgh Festival and garnered international acclaim.</p>
<p>The dialogue between Bedbound's two characters, a father and daughter mired in squalor, rattles along like a machine gun, bursting forth in unrelenting waves. Where Harold Pinter practised the art of silence, of pauses and what is left unsaid (think The Homecoming), Walsh's work thrives on the near impossibility of finding a space into which to squeeze another word. The father at one point describes a salesman he once knew “spinning out the patter that crackles in the air,” which would be an equally apt description of his own role.</p>
<p>A father (Richard Greenblatt) and daughter (Cathy Murphy) share a single, stained, tattered bed. Immersed in poverty and degradation, they ward off the demons of the past that chase them by filling the dreaded silence with endless chatter.</p>
<p>The tiny, sparse Tarragon Upstairs space seems made for this play, coercing the audience into an uncomfortable intimacy with the players. When Greenblatt's spittle starts flying, his white-knuckled hands wringing the bed's stained sheets, one rather wishes one could don a swine-flu mask, just in case.</p>
<p>Greenblatt is enthralling as the father who, fallen thanks to his misdeeds in his past glory (such as it was) as a furniture-store owner, rehashes the stories of his working life in an endless loop, showering scorn on various figures from his past.</p>
<p>Greenblatt spends many of these tirades perched on his knees and knuckles as though ready to pounce at the audience (a stance that takes on a whole new meaning in one particularly sordid sexual tale). But he is a toothless tiger, dishevelled and unthreatening. Greenblatt is brilliantly expressive, his eyes alternately slyly narrowed and bulging and manic, seeming at times not to need to blink.</p>
<p>Indeed, the force of Greenblatt's performance almost becomes a problem for the play. Murphy is impressive as the daughter, polio-ridden and tortured by the memory of her dead mother. She drags her atrophied legs about the bed, dutifully playing the roles of the figures her father berates in his reminiscences. The way she mouths the words of his tirades along with him is a sad reminder of the way both characters are trapped by these tales from the past, which have clearly been rehashed ad nauseam.</p>
<p>Murphy is deftly twitchy and manic, fiery and yet pitifully dependent on her dad. Her many expletives seem to build pressure inside her before breaking free in a rush of heavily aspirated Fs.</p>
<p>Greenblatt threatens to run away with the show at several junctures, until his character falls fast asleep in time to let Murphy's neuroses take centre stage. Still, one can't help but feel that Greenblatt has stolen the spotlight somewhat and that this detracts slightly from the play's give and take.</p>
<p>Smith's direction is clever, making the most of the pair's shifting positions within the bed and playing constantly with their proximity to each other, though at times the bed seems strangely spacious and accommodating.</p>
<p>The story ends on a tentatively hopeful note with a reconciliation of sorts that is jarring and only halfway convincing in its tenderness after the 68 minutes of animalistic vitriol, violence and torment that have preceded it.</p>
<p>But the lasting impression the play leaves is potent, and the silence that awaits the audience outside the theatre is all the heavier for it.</p>
<p>Bedbound continues until May 17 (www.mackenziero.com[http://www.mackenziero.com]).</p>

<p>Edmonton -- It is striking that Canada had 101 confirmed cases of H1N1, but the United States had only 244 (Flu: The Numbers –May 4). After all, the U.S. has 10 times as many people as Canada, and its population has much closer connections to Mexico.</p>
<p>I wonder whether part of the explanation is the difference in our health-care systems. Perhaps the U.S. is simply underreporting its incidence of H1N1, since those without health coverage there, including the working poor and illegal aliens, are unlikely to go to the doctor when they simply have the flu.</p>

</p>
<p>Mexico is not only at the epicentre of the H1N1 flu outbreak, but also of a virulent strain of gallows humour.</p>
<p>Known for their irony and dark wit, Mexicans have created everything from flu-inspired songs, to cringe-worthy puns and even a blue stuffed toy called “Achufy!”</p>
<p>“You better do the dance of the swine flu, if you feel a little sick, you better dance around with me,” the band Agrupacion Carino sings in its new song Influenza Cumbia, which has 407,411 hits on YouTube as of yesterday evening.</p>
<p>First known as “swine flu,” the virus has inspired countless pig-centred jokes: “When will there be a mass outbreak of human/avian swine flu? When pigs fly.”</p>
<p>Another references the border Mexico shares with the United States, and the wall built there to dissuade migrants from crossing: “They say in the U.S. they're not worried about swine flu passing over from Mexico. That's because nothing at all gets over the border.”</p>
<p>Last Monday, the 5.6-magnitude earthquake in the state of Guerrero inspired another round of jibes: “What did Mexico City say to the swine flu? You have me trembling.”</p>
<p>The flu virus, which has so far infected 727 people in Mexico and killed 26, is now in its “declining phase,” according to Jose Angel Cordova, Mexico's Health Secretary. Tomorrow, authorities will allow cafés, restaurants, museums and libraries to reopen.</p>
<p>But it appears the funny phase is just getting off the ground and, like H1N1, spreading quickly around the globe. In Germany, someone in the northern German city of Bremen decorated a sculpture of a pig with a face mask within days of the country confirming new cases. And the black humour has a firm hold on the blogosphere, which is rife with hog-related jokes. One blog has a “swine flu joke grid,” where pork and bacon can be cross-referenced with pandemic to produce endless puns: pigdemia, aporkalypse, hamthrax, hamocaust and snoutbreak. Swinefighter, an online game, lets players blast viral-looking piggies with hypodermic needles.</p>
<p>Some question whether it is in poor taste to make fun of a deadly virus that has prompted the World Health Organization to issue a level 5 pandemic alert.</p>
<p>“I think humour can be a useful coping mechanism in stressful times,” says Colin Lee, an associate medical officer of health at the Simcoe Muskoka District Health Unit in Ontario and co-author of The Flu Pandemic and You: A Canadian Guide. “But at this point in time of the outbreak and given that many people and their families have been affected, it is in poor taste.”</p>
<p>Indeed. Sniffed one online reader of a story on flu jokes in a New Zealand newspaper: “Great jokes, Kiwis, really funny people, when hundreds are dead and thousands infected, including your own countrymen. Maybe a Mobidly-FunnyJoke-Flu will affect your silly little country.”</p>
<p>For his part, Dr. Lee does not recall any black humour during the SARS outbreak in Toronto in 2003. But he believes that people joke about pandemics in general because they don't yet feel like a real threat. “It hasn't happened yet in our lifetime,” he said.</p>
<p>Mexicans are used to surviving calamitous events through humour. “It's common for people to laugh at themselves,” noted Armando Talamantes, a journalist in Mexico City. “I think it's a kind of escape for your mind. It doesn't mean they don't take the threat seriously.”</p>
<p>To alleviate the boredom of a five-day lockdown in the capital, Mexicans have been gathering in apartments, or joking online. “There's a new tool in <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> called, ‘Who would I cough on if I had influenza?' and you can choose up to five characters,” Mr. Talamantes said. “People are playing with that and choosing politicians.”</p>
<p>An NBC journalist noted on her blog that “bored-out-of-their-minds” staff in her hotel in the capital were pretending to cough on one another, laughing. “That, while perhaps in poor taste, was a sure sign they were certainly not worried,” Michelle Kosinski wrote.</p>
<p>Many Mexicans continue to wear face masks, though some are now shaped like snouts, or decorated with butterflies or kissy lips. Newspapers have published smiley cut-outs for people to paste on their masks, and some drivers have special ones for their cars and dogs. Also making the e-mail rounds is an image of Mexican national hero Benito Juarez on the blue 20-peso note, outfitted with a face mask.</p>
<p>Even telenovelas, the ubiquitous soap operas that dominate Mexican television, have felt the weight of the outbreak. In response to concerns that the flu could spread through kissing, Televisa, the world's biggest soap opera producer, decreed that smooching will be reduced to a minimum to protect the actors. That prompted cultural commentators to wonder how exactly “safe kisses” would be carried out: telepathically?</p>
<p>******</p>
<p>Flu funnies</p>
<p>Did you hear that Mexico has</p>
<p>become a world power? When it sneezes, the whole world gets the flu.</p>
<p>For a normal flu, we say “achoo,” but for swine flu we say “achoink.”</p>
<p>The only known cure for swine flu is the liberal application of oinkment.</p>
<p>Jay Leno: “Hey, have you all started making your summer</p>
<p>vacation plans? I'm not sure what to do this year. I'm stuck between a Somali pirate cruise or a trip to a Mexican pig farm.”</p>
<p>David Letterman: “A beautiful day here in New York City, wasn't it? But it was cold – so cold that I was wearing two swine flu masks.”</p>

</p>
<p>It was a sunny afternoon when I attempted the practise evacuation.</p>
<p>"Girls," I said, as my daughters squished globs of Play-Doh into animal moulds. "We need to go outside right now."</p>
<p>Sprawled on their bellies, they looked at me, all quizzical defiance.</p>
<p>"No," said twin No. 1, as she casually decapitated a green giraffe. "We playing Play-Doh!"</p>
<p>I glanced at my stopwatch: 84 seconds. Not good.</p>
<p>"Girls," I repeated, dropping to one knee. "Let's go outside right now in an orderly fashion."</p>
<p>"No thank you," said twin No. 2, handing me a lopsided penguin. "Daddy, do you like, 'Wheels on the Bus?' IT'S MY FAVOURITE!"</p>
<p>I sighed. The stopwatch had now ticked past two minutes.</p>
<p>Were these kids insane? What if our house really was engulfed in flames? What if flood water was creeping up the basement stairs? What if a truck carrying toxic chemicals crashed through the living room wall?</p>
<p>Oh, I've had disaster on my mind long before Emergency Preparedness Week started yesterday. More to the point: I've been thinking about how unprepared my family is for catastrophe.</p>
<p>As it turns out, we're not alone.</p>
<p>According to a Leger Marketing survey, while 86 per cent of Canadians feel it's important to be prepared for potential emergencies (ice storms, tornadoes, forest fires, extended blackouts), 42 per cent are not.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, "54 per cent feel they will experience an emergency within the next 10 years" but "only two-fifths of Canadians say they have an emergency preparedness kit."</p>
<p>According to the website bereadytoday.ca, such a kit should sustain a family for 72 hours.</p>
<p>It should include non-perishable food, bottled water, kitchen essentials, first aid supplies, warm clothing, sleeping bags, money, copies of important documents, a utility knife and tools such as a hammer and pliers.</p>
<p>The survey also shows that "less than one in three Canadians have discussed what to do in an emergency with their families;" "just 19 per cent have an emergency plan in place;" and "only 5 per cent have practised their emergency plan."</p>
<p>This is exactly why I am doing my best to prepare my family for the worst.</p>
<p>A few days after the botched evacuation exercise, I went downstairs and covertly shut down the electricity. Almost immediately, I could hear my wife bellow from our bedroom, where she had been reading to the girls.</p>
<p>"Hey, the power went out!" she said.</p>
<p>I stumbled upstairs in the dark. After tripping over a toy lawn mower, a doll stroller and a freakishly large Tigger, I entered our bedroom.</p>
<p>"This was just a test," I told my wife. "I turned off the power to demonstrate how important it is for us to have flashlights, fresh batteries and candles."</p>
<p>"What?" she asked. "The power is not really out?"</p>
<p>"No, I turned off the power to demonstrate</p>
<p>"</p>
<p>"Turn it back on. Now."</p>
<p>The next morning, as my children were eating Cheerios and mispronouncing words in nursery rhymes, I ambled into the kitchen with a plastic gas mask strapped to my face.</p>
<p>They immediately stopped singing Itsy Litsy Fider.</p>
<p>"Girls," I mumbled through the plastic chambers. "If the swine flu mutates into a more serious viral contagion, you might have to wear one of these to your dance class this summer. Do you understand?"</p>
<p>They stared at me with mute horror.</p>
<p>"You should also be familiar with this product," I said, holding up a roll of duct tape.</p>
<p>They started to cry.</p>
<p>"What's going on in there?" asked my wife, from the living room.</p>
<p>"Everything is fine," I said, removing the mask and hugging my frightened kids.</p>
<p>"I'm just trying to prepare this family for disaster."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ottawa demands answers from China; Questions quarantine of students, tourists in hotel and threatens trade challenge to Alberta pork ban</b>
</div><div>Joanna Smith   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>541 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- The federal government is pressing China to explain why it has quarantined seemingly healthy Canadians and banned the import of pork products from Alberta.</p>
<p>"China is operating outside of sound science," federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz told the House of Commons yesterday. "We are looking for clarification as to why it has gone as far as it has."</p>
<p>Canada would not hesitate to go to the World Trade Organization and challenge the ban if China does not back down, Ritz added.</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed over the weekend that 220 pigs on a central Alberta farm had contracted the influenza A H1N1 virus from a farm worker who had recently travelled to Mexico. On Sunday, China banned the import of Alberta pork.</p>
<p>The head of the Canadian Pork Council called the Chinese decision a "knee-jerk" reaction and said pork producers cannot take much more bad news.</p>
<p>"Our industry has gone under some severe economic pressure the last three years and our producers cannot handle much more of this," said Canadian Pork Council President Jurgen Preugschas.</p>
<p>Other countries banning Alberta pork are El Salvador, Honduras, the Philippines and Ukraine.</p>
<p>Russia has banned pork from Nova Scotia, Ontario and British Columbia, but not Alberta.</p>
<p>Ontario Agriculture Minister Leona Dombrowski said there are no reports of flu among pigs at any of the 2,800 hog farms in the province.</p>
<p>Preugschas said he spoke Sunday night with the owner of the affected Alberta farm, which he refused to identify over fears that media presence at the farm could potentially violate biosecurity standards.</p>
<p>"He's very concerned for himself and for his industry," said Preugschas, a pig farmer in Mayerthorpe, Alta.</p>
<p>In northern China, a group of Montreal students was making the best of a difficult situation at a guest house in Changchun, where officials ordered the apparently healthy group into a week-long quarantine as soon as they arrived for a Mandarin course.</p>
<p>The East Asian studies program at Universite de Montreal organized the trip for 23 Canadian, six international students and a language instructor.</p>
<p>An unknown number of Canadian tourists are also being held in quarantine at the Metro Park Hotel in the Wanchai district of Hong Kong after a guest tested positive for the influenza A H1N1 virus. None of the Canadians there is showing flu-like symptoms, said Foreign Affairs spokesperson Alain Cacchione.</p>
<p>"We still cannot believe what is happening." Martin Leroy Deslauriers, a 26-year-old student from Montreal, said in an email early today. "At first I found it funny, but when I realized (the quarantine) was going to be seven days, I was a little bit discouraged,"</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canadian officials would travel to meet the students today. Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon said both groups have access to consular assistance and officials are asking Chinese health authorities to clarify the situation.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ontario gears up for 1 in 3 falling ill; Flu pandemic scenario based on 4.5 million cases</b>
</div><div>Theresa Boyle   </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>489 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The swine flu virus will likely reach pandemic proportions, a key public health official says - and while the severity of the strain remains to be seen, Ontario has prepared for a scenario in which up to one in three residents fall ill.</p>
<p>"It's definitely not a bunch of hype, in my opinion. That doesn't mean that humanity is in big trouble," said Dr. Michael Gardam, director of infectious diseases with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, adding there is lots of "crystal-ball gazing" happening.</p>
<p>"I still don't think we've seen enough of it to really comment on how mild it is. We've only seen 1,000 cases outside of Mexico."</p>
<p>The provincial government revealed yesterday the number of Ontarians hit with the bug has almost doubled and now stands at 31. All cases have been "mild" with no one requiring hospitalization.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Ontario is prepared to roll out its pandemic plan, modelled on a "moderately severe" pandemic affecting up to 4.5 million people, Gardam said.</p>
<p>The model's assumptions are based on the 1957 flu pandemic. If a similar outbreak should occur, up to 13,000 people would die from the virus, up to 54,000 people would require hospitalization and 2.4 million would become sick enough to see a doctor.</p>
<p>Up to 2 million would become sick enough to take a day or two off work.</p>
<p>"The thing is, you can't predict how serious it's going to be. Maybe it will give 2 billion people in the world a nasty cold and it won't actually cause excess mortality," Gardam said.</p>
<p>The province's hospitals are already full, so there is a question about where 54,000 extra hospital beds would come from (in the scenario of a moderately severe pandemic). Primary health care providers, including family doctors and nurse practitioners, would be hard pressed to accommodate all the patients wanting to seem them.</p>
<p>"Imagine one in five people wanting to see their doctor over an eight- to 12-week period for flu. That's a big deal for a doctor," Gardam said.</p>
<p>Allison Stuart, assistant deputy minister of public health, told a news conference that in the event of a pandemic, hospitals would try to make room for flu patients by discharging some other patients early, moving patients into community care and cancelling or delaying some procedures.</p>
<p>She explained the province would also, in the event of a pandemic, open "flu centres" where people could get vaccinated.</p>
<p>The bug has now spread beyond the GTA, with four cases in Windsor-Essex and one case in each Oxford, Simcoe-Muskoka and the Sudbury area. There are nine cases in Toronto, seven in York, six in Durham and two in Peel.</p>

<p>Joanna Smith -- An Alberta girl is recovering in an Edmonton hospital after contracting Canada's first severe case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Alberta health officials said the girl, whose age was not released, had a more serious form of the illness than any previously seen in the country, which now has a total of 140 cases.</p>
<p>The girl has been in hospital for the past four days and is doing well, Dr. Andre Corriveau, the province's chief medical officer of health, told a news conference.</p>
<p>Health officials would not say where or if the girl attended school. Alberta has 24 confirmed cases of the H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Health ministry spokesperson Howard May said yesterday there are no indications that the girl or anyone she was in close contact with recently travelled to Mexico, but that is still under investigation.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said the news is "disconcerting" but Canadian officials had been expecting a severe case to eventually come along. "Our thoughts are with her and her family and we all wish her a fast and speedy recovery," Butler-Jones said in Ottawa yesterday.</p>
<p>"Up until now, we have been reporting that all confirmed cases in Canada have been relatively mild and that all have made full recoveries. However, the news of this first more severe case, although disconcerting, is not surprising and it does not change the course of action that we are taking."</p>
<p>He said there is no information at this point why the young girl has more severe symptoms than other Canadians with the disease.</p>
<p>"We don't really have anything specific to say why this person is more ill than other people," Butler-Jones said. "It is obviously a combination of factors, both the virus, genetic factors and the others that when it comes to immunity we all respond differently."</p>
<p>Butler-Jones noted seasonal influenza can also affect young people who were previously healthy.</p>
<p>"It is more common in the elderly and those with underlying chronic disease factors, but it does occur in previously perfectly healthy people as well," Butler-Jones said. "That is why we want to keep these messages going, not just now but always."</p>
<p>The Canadian Food Inspection Agency confirmed on the weekend that 220 pigs on a central Alberta farm had contracted the H1N1 virus from a farmworker who had recently travelled to Mexico.</p>
<p>In B.C., where there are 39 confirmed cases, Dr. Danuta Skowronski, the epidemiology lead for influenza and respiratory illness with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said it is likely the number of cases of swine flu will drop as the temperature warms up but it is possible the disease could re-emerge in the fall.</p>
<p>"Influenza doesn't like warmer temperatures," she said. "Your public health authorities will not get a summer break. We will be preparing for a return of this in the fall."</p>

<p>Two more swine flu cases confirmed in</p>
<p>Toronto, May 3</p>
<p>Upon reading your article regarding swine flu in Toronto, I became fearful about my safety as a secondary school student. Our school washrooms are unsanitary as the faucets lack ample water pressure, there is no soap in the dispensers, the drying machines are broken, and there are no paper towels.</p>
<p>Swine flu can be deterred by good hygiene, but in a rough economy with tight school funding will these conditions change? This pandemic will ultimately be disastrous if we cannot preach and practise proper hygiene in our schools.</p>

<p>China slaps ban on Alberta pork,</p>
<p>May 4</p>
<p>Pigs are so similar to us that not only did swine flu, renamed H1N1, spread from pigs to us, but Alberta pigs have caught it from a farm worker returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>Thomas Walkom's article in the Saturday Star said there were 950,000 pigs living in unspeakable conditions of filth and stress on the factory farm in Veracruz that is the probable origin of the illness. There is no sewage system, just a giant lagoon of swine feces. The owner is Smithfield Farms of Virginia.</p>
<p>In the name of competition and ever-cheaper food, there is a race to the bottom to raise animals as cheaply as possible. Huge farms, preferably in low-wage countries, plus a variety of drugs and hormones, assure us that pork, beef and chicken will remain low-cost. The drug companies that make hormones and antibiotics for pigs will make billions creating inoculation shots for new viruses and antiviral drugs for those exposed to flu.</p>
<p>When swine flu strikes, we are told to wash our hands. Our hygiene becomes the only thing that can be changed. Because of strong agribusiness lobbies, you can be sure there will be no new regulations to improve farming conditions that will continue to cause pandemics. However, we do have one additional power: we can insist the meat we eat is raised in healthy conditions by workers paid a living wage.</p>

</p>
<p>A Tamil protest planned for today, which was expected to draw tens of thousands into the downtown core to form a human chain, was hastily postponed late yesterday evening.</p>
<p>Campaign organizers said that in the last 48 hours, they have seen significant developments for their cause and felt at this time that a demonstration would not be necessary.</p>
<p>"The human chain has been called off temporarily due to the fact that Canadian academia has taken a strong stance against the Sri Lankan government, mainstream media has been great bringing the Tamil issue to the forefront and a lot of unions, a lot of union workers, are signing on board with us as well," said Aranee Muru, a spokesperson for the Coalition to Stop the War in Sri Lanka, who flatly denied reports the community was worried about swine flu. "Beyond all that, as we're looking at it, political leaders are starting to take notice ... We don't want to be an inconvenience to the Canadian people if what we're asking for is starting to get done."</p>
<p>Muru said she isn't worried about changing the plan so late in the day.</p>
<p>The GTA is said to be home to upwards of 200,000 Sri Lankan Tamils and Muru is sure that by bedtime last night, anyone planning to come downtown had heard the news.</p>
<p>"The Tamil community is a very mobilized community. One of the greatest aspects of the Tamil community is word-of-mouth. People already know it's been postponed," she said at about 10 p.m. last night.</p>
<p>Raj Rajagopalar was planning to attend the demonstration, but at about 7 p.m. he bumped into a friend. He had been at a convenience store and found out there. "The locals were talking," said the 19-year-old.</p>
<p>A <span class="companylink">Facebook</span> site called Massive Human Chain III (May 5 - Toronto), which has more than 3,200 members, posted the news around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Messages went out via Twitter and MySpace and Tamil television and radio stations were broadcasting the news.</p>
<p>It's through this speed of communication that the Tamil community has been able to stage such protests.</p>
<p>Last week, about 1,000 Tamil protesters occupied University Ave. around the clock for five days. In January, tens of thousands of demonstrators formed a human chain throughout the city centre.</p>
<p>Muru says her group has been using community radio and television stations, such as Tamil One, Tamil Vision and Global Tamil Radio, to keep the community informed.</p>
<p>"But primarily it's word-of-mouth," she said.</p>

<p>Saskatchewan pork producers are feeling the effects of the weekend's outbreak of the swine flu virus at an Alberta hog farm, despite assurances from industry officials and politicians that pork is safe to consume.</p>
<p>After it was discovered pigs on the central Alberta farm were infected with the A H1N1 influenza virus, China banned pork imports from the province.</p>
<p>Federal Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz said Monday that "China is operating outside of sound science.</p>
<p>"China has received those assurances from the World Health Organization and the OIE (the World Organization for Animal Health). They've also received calls from the minister of trade and myself on that very issue."</p>
<p>Florian Possberg, chair of the Canadian Swine Health Board, said the infection of pigs in Alberta has only added to the industry's grief. However, he said there is very little chance other pigs will get the flu from the infected hogs, since the Alberta pigs were quarantined as soon as the problem was discovered. Producers are also being told that if workers are coming back from holidays from infected areas, or showing flu symptoms, they should ensure the worker doesn't enter the hog barn.</p>
<p>Neil Ketilson, general manager of Sask Pork, said since the onset of the A H1N1 virus, hog prices have fallen around $20 per animal. With about 1.4 million slaughter animals produced in Saskatchewan each year, or almost 30,000 per week, he said the industry has been losing at least $600,000 a week.</p>
<p>Other countries, including Singapore, Honduras and the Philippines, have bans on Canadian imports, some of which were in place before the weekend. However, Ketilson said these countries are not major players in Saskatchewan's export market.</p>
<p>Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud said countries putting bans in place are doing so out of misinformation.</p>
<p>"I think they're not basing that on science or fact right now and hopefully cooler heads prevail and we get by that," he said.</p>
<p>But the minister rejected calls from NDP agriculture critic Pat Atkinson for the provincial government to provide financial assistance to the swine industry, saying that would be "jumping the gun."</p>
<p>He also noted payments for a prior government aid program are going out now.</p>
<p>With China now banning Alberta pork specifically, and more than a dozen countries banning Canadian pork and live hogs, the worry among Alberta hog producers is how Canada's export-dependent industry is going to fare should the situation snowball out of control.</p>
<p>Japan and the U.S., Canada and Alberta's biggest customers, aren't on the ban list, but hog farmer Jason Lenz is still worried.</p>
<p>"The biggest concern would be no matter how long that market stays closed to us, it's just one less market for us to export our product to, and the other concern is that other countries might follow suit and do the same," he said from his swine farm, where he has 1,500 hogs.</p>
<p>The Bentley, Alta., hog farmer called China's ban reactionary and unwarranted because the decision isn't based on science.</p>
<p>John Middel, a hog farmer from Rocky Mountain House, Alta., said he's apprehensive about the future and others are, too.</p>
<p>"It's totally unknown what's going to happen. It's just hard to say how it will unravel. But already prices have been significantly hit," Middel said.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency quarantined all 2,200 animals on the central Alberta farm, after they were exposed to the H1N1 virus by a worker. The Canadian worker, also a carpenter, had gone to Mexico to help build a church and returned to work on the pig farm.</p>
<p>In a press conference Monday, Jurgen Preugschas, president of the Canadian Pork Council, again called the bans a knee-jerk reaction, given H1N1 influenza A isn't a food safety issue, but one of human health.</p>
<p>Even if countries haven't banned Canadian pork, traders report some orders are being cancelled, Preugschas added.</p>
<p>"The stock markets are driven by the unknown. This type of thing is also driven by the unknown, and even though we're quite comfortable that pork is very safe, the hype has made it an unknown quantity," he said.</p>
<p>Alberta's pork exports were worth $342.1 million in 2008, with China accounting for just $4.4 million.</p>
<p>In question period Monday, Ritz warned the government could pursue World Trade Organization action if China doesn't end its ban.</p>
<p>Ritz later said he's spoken to China's ambassador, Lan Lijun, to reiterate that Canadian pork is safe, and "strongly encouraged" him to ensure China bases trade decisions on sound science.</p>
<p>"We will continue to stand up for Canadian pork producers and ensure that they are treated fairly by China and all members of the World Trade Organization," Ritz said.</p>

<p>A young Edmonton child was in intensive care Monday with the first known case of severe illness related to human swine influenza in Canada.</p>
<p>The child has no known connection to Mexico, and federal health officials said Monday they did not know whether the girl had any underlying medical conditions that would increase her risk of flu-related complications.</p>
<p>"We are starting to see some community-based spread," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>Up until now, all confirmed cases in Canada have been relatively mild, and all have made a full recovery.</p>
<p>"The news of this first, more severe case, although disconcerting, is not surprising, and it does not change the course of action that we are taking," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>He said more cases of swine flu, with varying levels of severity, will be uncovered, and the rogue virus is following the pattern of normal, seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>"This case underscores a couple of things about influenza. It has few boundaries. It doesn't respect borders. It often doesn't respect age. Nature is very unpredictable, as is the influenza virus," Butler-Jones said. "Even with regular seasonal flu we see people get very ill. We on occasion also see young, otherwise healthy people get very ill or die. It is a very, very serious disease. It takes its toll on people young and old. So we need to stay vigilant."</p>
<p>A total of 41 new confirmed cases of H1N1 flu virus were reported in Canada on Monday, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 140. The new cases include 10 in B.C., six in Alberta, 17 in Ontario -- including a four-year-old child -- one in New Brunswick, five in Nova Scotia and two in Prince Edward Island.</p>
<p>The Edmonton girl is in stable condition in hospital after contracting the disease, although it is not clear where she picked it up since she wasn't travelling.</p>
<p>"We have one young girl that was admitted to one of our hospitals with a more severe form of illness," said Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health. She "is doing well under care in the hospital."</p>
<p>The province would not release her age or say if she is old enough to attend school. Health officials said they are not contemplating closing any schools in Alberta at this time and are investigating where she contracted the virus.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said the number of global cases stands at 1,085 from 21 countries, including 26 deaths.</p>
<p>So far, human swine flu appears to have a longer than normal incubation period, causes diarrhea in about half of those it infects and can lead to severe pneumonia and deaths in young, healthy people, WHO officials said Monday. But it is still not known how often it leads to severe disease.</p>
<p>The New Brunswick case, the province's second, involved a woman in her 40s from the Fredericton area who has already recovered. Both cases in P.E.I. were mild, according to the P.E.I. Department of Health. Neither case resulted in hospitalization.</p>
<p>South of the border, H1N1 swine flu has now infected 286 people in 36 states, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported on Monday. The agency says 62 per cent of confirmed cases are in people under 18 years old. Most cases remain mild but 35 have resulted in hospitalization.</p>
<p>A 21-month-old toddler from Mexico who died in Houston, Texas, last week remains the only death in the United States so far.</p>
<p>In Mexico, officials say they hope cases there will continue to decline, but it was clear the outbreak of the never-before-seen strain of influenza was growing elsewhere.</p>
<p>WHO is one step away from calling the swine flu outbreak pandemic.</p>
<p>Last week, it raised its alert level to Phase 5 on a six-phase scale. The change was meant as a signal that a pandemic is likely imminent and that countries should activate their pandemic preparedness plans. But officials said Monday they had no immediate plans to go to Phase 6.</p>
<p>"We do not have any evidence that the virus has taken hold and led to community-level transmission in any other countries right now," said Dr. Keiji Fukuda, WHO's temporary assistant director-general for Health Security and the Environment.</p>
<p>"We are not certain when we will go to Phase 6. There's not a timetable. There's no timetable for how viruses like this spread out."</p>
<p>Officials are concerned about the infection travelling to the southern hemisphere, which is heading into its winter months, when influenza viruses usually thrive.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 25 Universite de Montreal students, in China to study Mandarin, and their teacher have been placed under quarantine in northern China for seven days as a precaution against swine flu.</p>
<p>Provincial health authorities stopped the group Sunday upon their arrival in Chang-chun airport in the province of Jilin.</p>
<p>They had their temperatures taken at the airport and then were bused to a university dormitory. None of the students is reported to have a fever.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canadian consular officers are in contact with the students "to ensure they are well cared for and have access to consular assistance."</p>
<p>She said officials are in contact with local Chinese authorities and will travel today to meet with the students. "Consular officials have already spoken with members of the group by phone and they report they are being well treated," she said.</p>
<p>While the new H1N1 strain is not food-borne, 20 countries worldwide had banned imports of pork as of Monday in response to the discovery of the H1N1 flu strain in a herd of pigs on a central Alberta hog farm.</p>
<p>Federal officials believe the infected pigs on the central Alberta hog farm -- the first known case of humans transferring the new strain into animals -- contracted the virus from a Canadian worker who returned from Mexico on April 12 and arrived on the farm two days later, showing flu symptoms shortly thereafter.</p>
<p>One other person on the farm has had mild symptoms. Officials are awaiting test results.</p>
<p>Both the worker and the approximately 220 infected pigs are recovering, but the animals have been quarantined, say officials. Global trade in pork meat is worth about $26 billion a year.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists are getting a clearer picture of how the new strain is behaving compared to normal seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Where garden-variety influenza normally has an incubation period of up to five days, human swine flu appears to have an incubation period of up to eight days. As well, diarrhea affects up to half of infected patients, far more than usual.</p>

</p>
<p>So far, whether one considers it from the perspective of the science and health officials involved, or from that of the governments, pundits and talking heads, the world appears to be acting as expected over the swine flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, while science and health officials seem to have a handle on the situation, too many politicians and jaw flappers are spouting nonsense -- about the flu bug swimming its way across the Rio Grande, pigs being unsafe to import, and subway cars being incubators of death.</p>
<p>Equally unfortunately, this was entirely predictable.</p>
<p>Historians who write about the impact of plagues on societies suggest that -- just as was the case in the early 14th century, when the Black Death visited Europe and claimed up to 40 per cent of the population, or when cholera swept the Americas in the mid-19th century and when the Spanish flu of 1918-19 claimed tens of millions -- community leaders, government officials and mobs tend to capitalize on the fear and scapegoat the vulnerable.</p>
<p>While one hopes the current overreaction doesn't degenerate into the kind of pogrom that claimed thousands of lives of Jews and other groups 700 years ago, there's reason to worry. Some governments have banned the importation of pork, needlessly quarantined travellers, called for air and land embargoes, or ordered massive culls of domestic animals, all without any scientific evidence that these measures will have an impact on the spread or severity of this outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>China, perhaps still smarting from the international black eye it got over trying to cover up the SARS epidemic that first broke out there, has been aggressive in attacking its international trade partners to demonstrate that it's taking decisive action to combat the spread of the swine flu. Unfortunately, China's decision to quarantine visitors and ban pork imports does nothing to protect its citizens, but much to discredit the country's attempt to demonstrate a modern scientific sophistication.</p>
<p>As disappointing has been China's reaction, that countries such as Russia, Switzerland, Croatia, Indonesia, Thailand and Ecuador have joined 13 others in banning pork imports only demonstrates how much work scientists really have to do beside tracking and controlling the H1N1 epidemic.</p>
<p>Attacking world trade is among the worst things governments can do in such a crisis. All it does is to reduce the level of international co-operation required to attack a problem faced by all humans, while it further impoverishes those countries who most need the money to pay for the public health systems needed to monitor and protect their citizens.</p>
<p>China's ban on Canadian pork was a seriously flawed bit of public policy, but Canada's threat to launch a retaliatory trade war is far from the rational response warranted. If such measures are adopted widely around the world in the midst of the worst economic downturn since the 1930s, any economic recovery will be seriously delayed.</p>
<p>Ironically, there has been a large measure of co-operation globally when it comes to health and science officials.</p>
<p>For example, in an interview in the journal Science, Mexico's chief microbiologist Celia Alpuche said as soon as evidence grew that something was amiss, scientists began to trace the source and the severity. When Mexico's efforts reached their limit, samples were sent to the Centres for Disease Control in the U.S. and the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab of the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>The American sample was held up for a day, but Dr. Alpuche said she sent the sample to Canada because of this country's experience with SARS. Frank Plummer, head of the Canadian lab, responded immediately upon receiving the sample at 3 p.m. on April 22 and contacted Mexico at midnight with the identity of the virus.</p>
<p>This sort of international co-operation among scientists is exactly what is needed if the world is to mitigate the damages from a global pandemic. To that end, China should be congratulated for allowing Taiwan to take part in World Health Organization efforts to monitor and control the flu.</p>
<p>As Howard Markel, a doctor and professor of medical history at the University of Michigan wrote in the weekend New York Times, with the wide arsenal of treatments available, the extent and co-operation of public health systems around the world and the incredible speed of communications through such media as the Internet, "There's never been a better time to have a pandemic than today -- except, that is, tomorrow."</p>
<p>If the response is to be better tomorrow, however, far greater efforts must be made to stop the unproductive scapegoating and panicking by officials. It's far better to redirect efforts and resources into strengthening public health systems globally, which will make it easier to identify and combat pandemics before the explode beyond our control -- particularly if the diseases first manifest themselves in the impoverished Southern Hemisphere.</p>

</p>
<p>Among my many faults is that of being a loud sneezer. My sneezes sound something like the shriek a karate expert lets out when he breaks a concrete block with the edge of his bare hand: Hi-YAAA!</p>
<p>This can startle people. And confuse them. They turn around expecting to see a karate expert standing over a broken concrete block, but it's just me, wiping my nose. Then they give me the stink eye, especially so at a time when we're threatened with a swine flu pandemic. When swine flu is going around, loud sneezers are about as popular as swine.</p>
<p>Mercifully, the swine flu is not as virulent or as deadly as was feared. I heard an epidemiologist on CBC radio the other morning concede that the hitherto dreaded swine flu now looks like any other of the flu bugs that go around from time to time. He almost sounded disappointed. Back into the garment bag goes his biohazard suit.</p>
<p>The news came to me, at least, as a huge relief. It wasn't the swine flu that had worried me, however. What worried me was the prospect of loud sneezers being rounded up and held in quarantine camps in an effort to prevent the contagion from spreading. We were just a day or two from a loud-sneezer roundup when the scare was revealed as a false alarm. Last week, when the warnings were still apocalyptic, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a Level 5 pandemic alert. That's just one short of Level 6, which is as high as the alert scale goes. Level 6 is when they come for the loud sneezers.</p>
<p>It is not encouraging to see international public health authorities are now more feverish than a lot of people who have actually caught the swine flu. Even though the outbreak reportedly is already receding in Mexico, where it first appeared -- and even though only 26 people have died worldwide, which is fewer than the number of people who during the same period choked to death on improperly chewed food -- the WHO reportedly still is considering a Level 6 alert. In other words, after crying wolf over what turns out to be a poodle, they're ready to cry wolf even louder.</p>
<p>They should take two Aspirin and go to bed. I'd just hate to see loud sneezers sent to quarantine camps for no good reason.</p>
<p>My own loud sneezing, it so happens, has nothing to do with any viruses going around. Rather, it is genetic. My mother is a champion loud sneezer. In the mornings during hay fever season she could wake up everyone in the house with her sneezing. It sounded like Bruce Lee fighting a troop of ninjas:</p>
<p>Hi-YAAA! Hi-YAAA! Hi-YAAA!</p>
<p>At least if I am confined to loud-sneezer quarantine camp, I'll be in there with my mom. We might even enjoy being among all the other loud sneezers. For once no one would -- Hi-YAAA! -- judge us. It might be something like the Wizard of Oz film set when all the little people cast as Munchkins were for the first time in their lives among others like themselves. For many, it was totally liberating. Of course, their mothers weren't there to keep a lid on things.</p>
<p>It was from my mother that I learned about loud sneezing etiquette. Primly sneezing into a tissue won't do it. No tissue can withstand a seriously loud sneeze. You might as well use a tissue to block the muzzle of a water cannon. The only thing that can contain a loud sneeze is a heavy canvas bag pulled over your head. If an approved sneeze bag is not available, a beach towel will do. Even then, the loud sneezer must retire to a far corner of the room and face away from people before letting go. He must also give up any hope for a career as a cat burglar, a librarian or a bomb disposal technician.</p>
<p>The rewards of loud sneezing might be a fair tradeoff. I have no scientific data to back up this claim, but it seems to me that loud sneezers tend to be healthier than the general population. My mom, so far as I know, has never had the flu. Last time I had it, Pierre Trudeau was prime minister. I haven't voted Liberal ever since.</p>
<p>That loud sneezing improves resistance to disease would stand to reason. A loud sneezer violently expels from his respiratory system the maximum number of infectious viruses.</p>
<p>The quarantine camps beckon.</p>

<p>A handful of Crown corporation employees who recently vacationed in Mexico were told to spend a week at home with pay before reporting for work.</p>
<p>It's an example of one of the precautions some companies have taken while the H1N1 flu creeps into nearly every province but Saskatchewan.</p>
<p>SGI spokesperson Kim Hambleton said a few staff members who returned from Mexican vacations were asked to spend about a week at home to ensure they didn't fall ill. The workers left on their trips prior to Canada issuing an advisory against non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>But when the World Health Organization last week upped its alert to five on the six-level scale, SGI employees who happened to be returning from vacations in any locations affected by H1N1 cases -- including several areas of the United States -- were also told to stay home for two paid days. That policy automatically kicked in as a result of past pandemic planning by SGI, Hambleton said.</p>
<p>"That was very short-lived, because based on the information we got from Saskatchewan Health and the World Health Organization about not having travel restrictions, we amended our plan. Now it just affects travel to Mexico," Hambleton said.</p>
<p>One of <span class="companylink">SaskEnergy</span>'s 1,100 employees was also asked to stay at home for a week after a recent trip to Mexico due to the area where the individual went, said spokesperson Dave Burdeniuk. But while it's a precaution the company is prepared to take, it's not a knock on productivity, said Burdeniuk, who noted all <span class="companylink">SaskEnergy</span> business is continuing in the normal fashion.</p>
<p>"For us, it's business as usual," he said.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Health has not as a rule advised the general population to stay home after returning from Mexico unless they are sick.</p>
<p>Flu viruses are most transmissible when carriers have symptoms, said ministry spokesperson Karen Hill.</p>
<p>"If you're feeling fine, we are saying that you should continue with normal activities but to monitor your symptoms," she said.</p>

</div><div>Sylvain Charlebois   </div>
<div>Special to The Leader-Post</div>

</p>
<p>Egypt began slaughtering its roughly 300,000 pigs as a precautionary measure against the spread of swine flu, even though no cases have been reported in either humans or animals in that country. Underlying religious reasons led to this decision, but the policy is still considered by many to be extreme.</p>
<p>At least 12 countries, from China to Russia to Ukraine, have set bans on all pork product imports. Even Canada has seen its share of panicky assessments. Pork inspections have been increased in an attempt to ease any concerns consumers may have in light of the global influenza A H1N1 outbreak. Even so, there is no evidence that swine flu can be transmitted through eating meat from infected animals. None. Worse, no scientific data suggest the current strain in its entirety has any link with hogs. In the meantime, hog futures are down and the hog industry is losing millions. From an epidemiological standpoint, the menace is real. But, when it comes to food safety, the "swine flu" story is a really nothing more than a sign of the times.</p>
<p>All around the world, panic occasioned by outbreaks of the influenza</p>
<p>A H1N1 virus is incommensurate with the risks of contracting it by eating pork. Public officials are making unfounded decisions based on trivial information at best. Many elements have triggered this phenomenon to occur. The obvious culprit, for lack of a better term, is the media, but before we point too many fingers, there is a lot more going on than merely fear-driven reporting.</p>
<p>Many criticize the media for the insufficient information and/or misinformation with which they bombard the general population in times of</p>
<p>crisis. One should understand that misapprehension of risk by media and news audiences is not exclusively responsible for disproportionate fear or panic, but panic is more likely to occur when a threat receives substantial media coverage. In a crisis, media need instant access to data that may not yet exist, specialists and authorities who are not available, or assertions about issues that appropriate sources may not feel prepared to make. Like consumers and trade officials, the media, too, have to make crucial decisions with weak evidence. In addition, because public understanding of science is often limited with respect to such crises, it is challenging for the media to sufficiently dilute systematic constructs for the public to understand.</p>
<p>However, the media can hardly be blamed, given the multifaceted state of affairs during such an event. In essence, the media coverage for the influenza A H1N1 is both frightening and functional. It cultivates fear and apprehension, but provides an opportunity for the public to get educated on the issue. The media is fuelling the problem, perhaps, but it has a cause. Currently in Canada, no public authority can play a more effective role than the media can in times of public health crisis. Media can operate virtually in real time in this day and age, whereas public authorities must painstakingly react to incidents. Unlike the media, from whom the public is willing to accept a certain degree of error and backtracking, public health authorities simply cannot prematurely release information that could have so devastating an effect as to, for example, prompt the unnecessary slaughter of hundreds of thousands of perfectly safe and healthy livestock.</p>
<p>What has been interesting during this crisis, at least in the Canadian media, is the frequent repetition that pork is safe, that there is no evidence this particular flu is spread by pigs or by pork products, and so on. And yet, pork futures are dropping and healthy pigs are being slaughtered in as yet otherwise unaffected parts of the world as a "precautionary measure." Why this is so may, in fact, have less to do with real panic over the epidemic and more to do with simply the way that food trades work.</p>
<p>Considering food trades, borders are usually only selectively opened. Borders serve important roles in modern economies. They safeguard</p>
<p>sovereignty of nations, impose economic protectionism, and assure the screening out of undesirable products. Regrettably, embargoes and restrictions occur almost on a daily basis for all sorts of reasons, justified or not. The Influenza A H1N1 is the latest excuse some countries are using. It is, in fact, just part and parcel of the normal trading process.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, these measures foster market fear, which leads to unwise behaviours. Pork is the cheapest protein available, and many developing countries depend on its accessibility and affordability to feed their populations. Decisions to restrict pork imports will actually have a devastating impact on food retailers, the transportation sector, restaurants, and most importantly, consumers. Economic multiplier effects, coupled with public panic concerning the infectivity of Influenza A H1N1 in people, may also create a pervasive atmosphere of fear and pessimism that could aggravate the current economic downturn felt in the global economy.</p>
<p>What really triggered this public health panic was simply the fact that the public is now more prone to accept risk prevention measures than ever before, especially in matters involving food. BSE, foot and mouth, major salmonella, listeria, and E. Coli outbreaks have forever altered risk perceptions of consumers worldwide. Even the succession of less serious food recalls and food-related nuisances have taken their toll on the world population, and public authorities know this. Nonetheless, many argue their decisions may make matters worse, not better.</p>
<p>It is difficult to blame anyone, therefore, for the hog industry's woes. The media, the public, and the food trades are all inclined to respond aggressively and perhaps prematurely to such events. The baseless correlation between the current pandemic and the hog industry simply exists in people's minds, and it may be too late to avert major losses. Chicken farmers in some parts of the world had to face the same problem a few years back with the avian flu spread. Media do have a role to play in food crises, but global events related to food are inherently fluid and the message should constantly change.</p>
<p>The disconnect between hogs and Influenza A H1N1 should become evident in a relatively short time, as the epidemic itself seems to be mellowing. Whether such a revelation will occur in time to prevent serious damage to agriculture sectors worldwide remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Sure, Chelsea Cassano is disappointed she will only make a brief appearance at her final University of Regina Cougars women's basketball breakfast as a player today, but she knows it is for the best.</p>
<p>Cassano is one of eight Cougars players who returned from Mexico on Sunday morning and fears over swine flu mean they will only pop in for a few moments of the annual fundraiser. Players usually greet patrons at the door and mingle through the crowd during the event.</p>
<p>"We all feel healthy and haven't shown any signs of anything," said Cassano, who completed her final year of CIS eligibility this season. "We're not really worried, but it's just the precautions just in case.</p>
<p>"It's definitely a bit disappointing, because it's nice to give back to the community and to show them how much we appreciate their support. But we realize if something were to happen and one of us did have the swine (flu) it's better that this is the way for this to happen. This way we can at least show our faces for a few minutes to show that we appreciate what the community has done."</p>
<p>Like any virus, the swine flu is most likely to be passed on if someone is showing symptoms.</p>
<p>Cougars head coach Dave Taylor said when he and other event organizers realized the timing of the vacations, they consulted with public health officials and occupational health workers at the university before allowing the players to go to the breakfast at all.</p>
<p>"There was a chance we were not going to have them at the breakfast -- we started with that," said Taylor. "We even talked about postponing, but that was never really serious."</p>
<p>But since the breakfast falls outside the 36-hour time frame during which people should start showing symptoms, there is little worry for the public. Still, to err on the side of caution, the players won't be in the crowd, but will appear on stage at the Conexus Arts Centre while speeches about the 2008-09 season -- which included a second straight CIS silver medal -- are read.</p>
<p>"We're probably being overly cautious, but out of respect to the people who come and because there's so much media attention about this, we're trying to be more on the safe side than we need to be," said Taylor.</p>

<p>LeBRON NAMED MVP</p>
<p>Unstoppable at both ends of the floor this season, LeBron James claimed the league MVP Monday, receiving the award in the high school gym where he first emerged on the national scene. "This is a place where all my dreams started and where I thought they could become real," James said in accepting the award at St. Vincent-St. Mary High School in Akron, Ohio. The Cleveland Cavaliers' star averaged 28.4 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.2 assists this season, his sixth as a pro. "Individual accolades come when team success happens," said James, 24.</p>
<p>MARTIN FINED $25,000</p>
<p>The NBA fined Denver Nugget Kenyon Martin US$25,000 for throwing Dallas Maverick Dirk Nowitzki to the floor in the opener of their playoff series.</p>
<p>LIONS EYE FOOTE</p>
<p>While several teams are interested in pursuing linebacker Larry Foote, who was released by the Pittsburgh Steelers Monday, the Detroit Lions are clearly the front-runners in signing him. Foote has made it known that he would like to return to his hometown of Detroit.</p>
<p>MUIRFIELD TO HOST IN 2013</p>
<p>The British Open will return to Muirfield on Scotland's east coast in 2013, organizers the Royal & Ancient (R&A) said Monday. It will be the 16th time the par-71 links course has hosted golf's oldest major championship. Muirfield last staged the Open in 2002 when Ernie Els won the title in a four-way playoff with Steve Elkington, Stuart Appleby and Thomas Levet.</p>
<p>INDIANS 9 JAYS 7</p>
<p>Josh Barfield singled home the go-ahead run in the 12th inning and the Cleveland Indians beat the Toronto Blue Jays 9-7 Monday in Toronto. Mark DeRosa opened the 12th with a double to right off Shawn Camp (0-1). One out later, Luis Valbuena walked and Barfield followed with a single up the middle, scoring DeRosa.</p>
<p>TWINS 7 TIGERS 2</p>
<p>Francisco Liriano had a season-high nine strikeouts and Michael Cuddyer hit a two-run triple in a five-run seventh, leading the Minnesota Twins to a 7-2 win over the host Detroit Tigers Monday night. Miguel Cabrera hit a solo homer in the sixth inning for the Tigers.</p>
<p>INFECTED PLAYER BANNED</p>
<p>A Mexican soccer player has been banned for spitting and blowing nasal secretions at an opponent then telling him he had swine flu. Guadalajara defender Hector Reynoso has been suspended from all matches in the Libertadores Cup after last week's game at Everton of Chile.</p>
<p>INDY TESTING BEGINS</p>
<p>Seven veterans who have had limited track time in the past year are expected to begin the Indianapolis 500 rookie orientation program along with six first-year drivers. Former Champ Car Series champion Paul Tracy is among the veterans on the track today. The Indy 500 is May 24.</p>
<p>PREAKNESS UP NEXT</p>
<p>Kentucky Derby winner Mine That Bird is headed to the Preakness. The trainer of the gelding that won the Derby at 50-1 odds said his horse will run in the May 16 Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown, Pimlico officials said Monday.

<p>A young Edmonton child was in intensive care Monday with the first known case of severe illness related to human swine influenza in Canada.</p>
<p>The child has no known connection to Mexico, and federal health officials said Monday they did not know whether the girl had any underlying medical conditions that would increase her risk of flu-related complications.</p>
<p>"We are starting to see some community-based spread," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>Up until now, all confirmed cases in Canada have been relatively mild, and all have made a full recovery.</p>
<p>"The news of this first, more severe case, although disconcerting, is not surprising, and it does not change the course of action that we are taking," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>He said more cases of swine flu, with varying levels of severity, will be uncovered, and the rogue virus is following the pattern of normal, seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>"This case underscores a couple of things about influenza. It has few boundaries. It doesn't respect borders. It often doesn't respect age. Nature is very unpredictable, as is the influenza virus," Butler-Jones said. "Even with regular seasonal flu we see people get very ill. We on occasion also see young, otherwise healthy people get very ill, or die. It is a very, very serious disease."</p>
<p>A total of 41 confirmed new cases of H1N1 flu virus were reported in Canada on Monday, bringing the number of confirmed cases to 140.</p>

<p>Four swine flu cases stemming from travel to Mexico have been confirmed in Windsor and Essex County and health officials warned Monday to expect more cases.</p>
<p>The positive cases, which officials described as "mild," involve two men and two women between the ages of 21 and 29.</p>
<p>"All of the individuals are associated with travel to Mexico. All of the individuals are recovering," said Dr. Allen Heimann, the medical officer of health. "None of the individuals required hospitalization and none of the individuals required antiviral therapy."</p>
<p>Including the four positive cases confirmed Monday and three negative cases identified last week, local officials are monitoring 51 potential cases of swine flu, which is now being dubbed the H1N1 virus. Of those cases, four involve teens.</p>
<p>"I would expect we will probably have some more positives, how many I don't know, and we will certainly have some more negative cases," said Heimann, who cautioned against panic.</p>
<p>"None of the individuals that we're following right now, from the information that I have right now, have significant illness."</p>
<p>There are 31 confirmed cases of the H1N1 virus in Ontario, most of them clustered in the Greater Toronto Area, involving 20 women and 11 men with a median age of 24. There are 140 cases in Canada. There are about 1,000 cases globally in at least 18 countries.</p>
<p>Local health officials are dedicating resources to monitoring the situation in Leamington, which is home to many migrant workers from Mexico, the epicentre for this most recent outbreak.</p>
<p>"We have been in communication with our local agency who is responsible for monitoring where these individuals are, how long and when their arrival has been into our area," said Deb Bennett, the health unit's director of health protection.</p>
<p>"We have not had any illness confirmed from that population, however, we do realize that it is a risk population and we will definitely be contacting and monitoring the situation carefully until we can identify what the degree of illness is out there."</p>
<p>Of the three cases that have proved negative, one involved a migrant worker, added Heimann.</p>
<p>Heimann speculated the virus was affecting 20-somethings more than others because they weren't alive to develop resistance to the virus when the last outbreak occurred in 1976. He added this age group was probably more likely than others to travel to Mexico for spring break.</p>
<p>"They may be the most exposed, they may also be the most susceptible because of their lack of previous exposure," he said.</p>
<p>Heimann urged local residents to cover their mouths when coughing and to regularly wash their hands. He said anyone who feels ill should stay home from work and that parents should keep ill children home from school.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The doctor in your pocket; In an ongoing project, health-innovation researcher Neil Seeman solicits your ideas for tackling Canada's health care crisis. This week's topic: The cellphone as medical tool</b>
</div><div>Neil Seeman   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>942 words</div><div>5 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A15</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Here's what I'll call the "60/60 challenge." Sixty per cent of the world now has a cellphone, according to a recent UN report -- and 60% of Canadian adults now live with one or more chronic conditions, such as diabetes, cancer, asthma, hypertension or depression. Chronic illness spares few among us: The world is getting fatter, older and sicker.</p>
<p>Add to this a global financial meltdown and a swine flu outbreak -- and we have a perfect storm. Many health care systems are unsustainable. Forget for a moment about fancy robotic surgery, personal genomics or the electronic medical record (EMR) -- a digital transcript of a doctor's visit, including patient histories, exam notes, tests and medications. An EMR, though critical to patient safety, costs money and takes time to launch. Let's think instead about cellphones.</p>
<p>Lots of very smart people across the world -- from Menlo Park, Calif., to Bihar, India -- are churning out low-cost, low-tech innovations that can help people manage their chronic conditions. Cellphones may be a large part of the answer. Imagine if medication reminders, scheduling notifications or lab test information could be transmitted to cellphone users through text messages.</p>
<p>Could mass cell messages from the U. S. Centers for Disease Control And Prevention (CDC) remind us to wash our hands and cough into our sleeves, thereby slowing viral spread during a pandemic? Imagine if you could receive diabetes management tips through your cellphone. Or imagine if a nurse could send a cellphone alert to a worried mom telling her how long she'd need to wait before her sick child could see an emergency room doctor. Imagine if doctors and nurses were reimbursed for such alerts.</p>
<p>All of this is eminently feasible. HealthPia America, a Newark-based company, has a cellphone that also serves as a blood glucose monitor and pedometer (a device that counts your steps). British patients with diabetes have, since 2002, been signing up for Sweet Talk, a service that reminds them via cellphone to take their insulin and offers general education about how to live well with diabetes. Your cellphone is the doctor in your pocket: It offers real-time intervention and targeted clinical decision support.</p>
<p>Many health policy wonks wince at the suggestion of using cellphones for health care, serving up tedious objections: "information overload" for patients; "too much work" for doctors; and "reimbursement nightmares" for insurers or governments. Many talk about the "digital divide": the idea that e-health tools, even cellphones, only target the rich and bypass the problems of the poor.</p>
<p>But the digital divide argument melts away upon inspection. In many poor countries, such as China and Pakistan, cellphone use is soaring. In</p>
<p>South Africa, cellphone penetration is extensive, allowing health care workers to convey text instructions to millions who are suffering from one of the largest HIV/AIDS epidemics in the world. And though it's true that some groups (notably the mentally ill)may be uncomfortable with many types of e-gadgets, the cellphone is pretty familiar fare. For the mentally ill who don't trust cellphones, support information can be sent out to concerned family members.</p>
<p>To be sure, every patient and every doctor is different. Some patients love to be bombarded with information while some don't. I suspect patients just want a choice. Many doctors (and, presumably, cash-strapped governments) would be happy to nudge the public into better health through a cellphone text message reminder. And, for patients, receiving text messages is free!</p>
<p>Can anything in health care be "free"? Well, let's just say "free enough." "Free" is the most popular search query on <span class="companylink">Google</span>. According to <span class="companylink">Google</span> Trends, it outpaces "sex" by about 2:1 globally; weirdly, the ratio is 3:1 in Canada ... we're either stingier or more prudish than the rest of the world. (And yes, lots of Internet users are searching for "free sex.")</p>
<p>A cellphone plan might cost you $40 per month with a free incoming text messaging service. By comparison, the Obama administration wants to ensure electronic medical records for every American by providing financial incentives to physicians of up to US$65,000 apiece to those eligible, starting in 2011. On top of which you need to factor in the billions of dollars in e-infrastructure.</p>
<p>Here's the thing about "free." Those same smart folks in California and India -- the low-tech innovators -- are on a near-religious mission to make every guild-like information industry, from law to real estate to health care, as free or close to free as possible. If you work in one of these industries, watch your back; the geek barbarians are at the gate.</p>
<p>So think about your cellphone. Can it address the 60/60 challenge to help people with chronic disease? Can it reduce wait times for surgical appointments? Can it help you find a doctor or specialist, reduce medication errors or improve the quality of your health care experience?</p>
<p>Please think of a way cellphones can help fix health care and send your suggestions to secondopinionpost@gmail.com, or post your ideas on the Second Opinion Web site at www.nationalpost.com/secondopinion[http://www.nationalpost.com/secondopinion]. Readers' ideas will be featured in a follow-up column. - Neil Seeman is director and primary investigator of the Health Strategy Innovation Cell at Massey College, University of Toronto.</p>

</p>
<p>In early April, a Canadian run surveillance system that sweeps the Internet for signs of emerging disease unearthed a tiny article from a local Mexican newspaper.</p>
<p>The four-paragraph item told of a "strange epidemic outbreak" of flu-like illness that had struck 60% of the people in La Gloria, a 3,000-strong town in Mexico's mountainous Veracruz state. As it turned out, the obscure bulletin provided the world's first hint that a brand-new flu virus was afoot, one that would eventually spread throughout Mexico and far beyond its borders.</p>
<p>It was the latest coup for the Public Health Agency of Canada group, whose Web-scouring programs also found the earliest portent of the arrival of SARS, though it took months for Chinese authorities to confirm the presence of that virus.</p>
<p>In fact, more than half of the 578 outbreaks identified by the World Health Organization between 1998 and 2001 were first picked up by the Canadian system, according to a paper published this week in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>"It's very valuable, because sometimes countries can be so busy being internally concerned with what's happening, they may not have time to advise other organizations," said Vivienne Allan, a WHO spokeswoman in Geneva. "All public-health intelligence gathering is useful."</p>
<p>But how much difference do such surveillance systems really make in combatting emerging disease? The new swine flu strain was discovered-- in the United States --a week after the La Gloria story surfaced, and it was another 10 days before a Canadian lab determined the same virus was making people ill in Mexico.</p>
<p>SARS spread around the world months after Global Public Health Intelligence Network (GPHIN) first detected reports of an unusual outbreak of respiratory disease in China's Guangdong province.</p>
<p>Outside experts say programs like it and Harvard Medical School's HealthMap are useful, but only when combined with other sources of information that, pieced together, paint a bigger picture.</p>
<p>"It's still a lot of information, a lot of noise," said Dr. Gunther Eysenbach, a senior scientist with the University of Toronto's Centre for Global eHealth Innovation.</p>
<p>"In hindsight, you can say this was the first indication, but ... when you look at all these reports coming in from all over the world on a daily basis, it is hard or impossible to tell which of these reports constitutes a real threat."</p>
<p>Attempts are being made, though, to hone the concept. Dr. Eysenbach, for instance, is looking at analyzing messages on the social-networking site Twitter, and recruiting ordinary people as "sentinels" who could report their own illnesses.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, officials with the WHO and the Pan-American Health Organization outlined the sequence of events that began with the Canadian unit's find early last month.</p>
<p>Late on April 4, a Mexican news Web site published its story, saying that 60% of La Gloria had been infected with an unknown respiratory illness and that two children had died of pneumonia, which may have been connected to the outbreak. It quoted a health official as saying that all inhabitants were being vaccinated, houses were being fumigated and streets were being cleaned. Much later, tests revealed that a five-year-old boy in the town had contracted the virus in April, arguably making him the first known case of the swine flu.</p>
<p>Software used by the Canadian system retrieves relevant articles every 15 minutes, day and night, largely through news two news "aggregators," Al Bawaba and Factiva. Many items are analyzed by GPHIN staff to determine their significance, according to the recent journal article by Mikaela Keller, a Harvard Medical School researcher.</p>
<p>GPHIN found the La Gloria article, translated it and passed on the information to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) on April 10, said Donna Eberwine-Villagran, a PAHO spokeswoman.</p>
<p>The organization asked Mexican authorities to look into the report. They responded on April 12, confirming there had been an outbreak of severe respiratory infection of an unknown cause and that it was a "potential event of international importance," Ms. Eberwine-Villagran said.</p>
<p>More reports of respiratory outbreaks elsewhere in Mexico followed in the coming days, then, on April 18, the United States notified PAHO of two confirmed American cases of a new swine flu virus.</p>
<p>More suspicious cases surfaced in Mexico and on April 27, tests at the Public Health Agency labs in Winnipeg confirmed Mexico's first two cases of the novel bug, said Ms. Allan of the WHO.</p>

<div>628 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>A team of health-care workers is to visit a Pierrefonds private school today following news on the weekend that one of the students had tested positive for the so-called swine flu virus.</p>
<p>Quebec also confirmed yesterday the province's third H1N1 infection, in a Montérégie man. Like the two other cases, the man had returned recently from a vacation in Mexico, where the influenza virus is believed to have originated.</p>
<p>"He is in isolation at home and his case is mild," said Alain Poirier, director of Quebec's Public Health Department.</p>
<p>As for Collège Charlemagne - where a child reported to be Quebec's second H1N1 case is a student - there are no plans to close the school or to screen students and staff for the virus, government officials said.</p>
<p>"The purpose of the health-care team is to answer questions and give information," Poirier explained.</p>
<p>"No one in the student's class - neither the professors nor the students - have any symptoms. You would expect that in a school of this size - 1,400 students and 100 professors and employees - you will surely have viral and respiratory infections.</p>
<p>"But in the student's immediate entourage, there have been no symptoms reported. Will there be any new cases? It's possible and we will be following the situation closely."</p>
<p>The student who got sick was not hospitalized. The student had attended classes last week before a test confirmed the H1N1 infection, and has been told to stay at home until there is no more risk of transmission.</p>
<p>The period of self-quarantine is seven days from the first appearance of symptoms, but authorities couldn't say when the child will return to class.</p>
<p>Collège Charlemagne has students in primary and secondary levels as well as children in pre-school.</p>
<p>Stéphane Chayer, president of the parents' committee at Collège Charlemagne, said he had confidence in both the government and the school administration.</p>
<p>"The situation seems stable," Chayer told The Gazette. "The school administration has been very involved and we have been kept informed.</p>
<p>"If they say that the school should be kept open, I'm okay with that," he added.</p>
<p>Michel Doré, an official with Quebec's Civil Security Department, urged parents to keep children at home if they learn they are sick. He said schools should continue with hygiene precautions, but there is no reason to close them.</p>
<p>"The (flu) cases that we've had are not severe - they are benign - and for the moment we don't intend to close schools," Doré told a news conference.</p>
<p>The same applies to daycares across the province, he added.</p>
<p>Poirier echoed Doré's remarks: "Extraordinary measures like closing airports, closing borders, closing schools and other institutions seem out of proportion" with the actual threat.</p>
<p>Asked if he thought the threat is less grave than it was last week, Poirier responded that all the cases in Canada thus far have been mild and there has been no human-to-human transmission of the virus in Quebec. He said that unlike Mexico, the province has no plans to distribute breathing masks to the public.</p>
<p>"But the virus is in a constant state of mutation," he warned.</p>

<p>PREVENTION AS EASY AS WASHING HANDS</p>
<p>Health experts say hand-washing is a surprisingly effective way to prevent all sorts of diseases, including ordinary influenza and the new and mysterious swine flu virus.

<p>Egyptian riot police clashed yesterday with stone-throwing pig farmers trying to prevent their animals from being taken away for slaughter as part of a nationwide cull.</p>
<p>Between 300 and 400 residents of the hilly Moqattam slum district of Cairo, where mostly Coptic Christian scrap merchants raise pigs, hurled stones and bottles at police.</p>
<p>Anti-riot police replied by firing rubber bullets and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, most of them youths. An AFP correspondent said protesters ransacked a police post and an officer fired warning shots in the air.</p>
<p>A security official and pig farmers said in the evening that government workers will return today to begin confiscating the pigs, the government having promised the farmers compensation.</p>
<p>Seven police officers were slightly injured in the Moqattam clashes, a security official said, while at least eight demonstrators were hurt, according to the correspondent and a medic.</p>
<p>One injured protester lay sedated in a neighbourhood hospital bed, with birdshot wounds to his thighs and stomach.</p>
<p>At least five protesters were dragged away by police, two of them bloodied. A community leader later told pig farmers and rubbish collectors gathered at a church in the slum that the arrested men had been released.</p>
<p>Similar troubles broke out yesterday in Khanka, north of the capital, security officials said.</p>
<p>In the Cairo neighbourhood of Basateen, hundreds of farmers clashed with police, injuring a senior officer and four other police officers, according to state news agency MENA.</p>
<p>Egypt began the cull of the nation's 250,000 pigs in earnest on Saturday, despite the World Health Organization saying there was no evidence the animals were transmitting swine flu to humans.</p>
<p>The authorities are calling the slaughter a general health measure. No cases of swine flu, or influenza A(H1N1), have been reported in Egypt.</p>

</p>
<p>"The only mask in the street is a condom, and sometimes not even that, because a lot of clients pay extra to avoid using them," 40-year-old Mexico City prostitute Fatima said.</p>
<p>The swine flu epidemic that has spread fear throughout Mexico and the rest of the world, and led millions to don surgical masks, appeared absent in late-night activity on Sullivan St. in downtown Mexico City.</p>
<p>Prostitutes and their clients were mask-less and apparently unconcerned by the epidemic that sparked a virtual shutdown of most of Mexico City.</p>
<p>"A lousy flu won't take us off work if AIDS and other venereal diseases haven't already done so. And there's even a cure for the flu. There's no cure for AIDS," Fatima said.</p>
<p>Despite no obvious flu victims, their business did not escape infection from the impact of the epidemic, like most across the country.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu hit the profession hard across the country, according to the NGO Street Brigade. Restrictive measures imposed by the government to keep people inside had reduced clients nationwide by 40 per cent, and a dozen states had seen 70 per cent of street workers suspend work.</p>
<p>But the impact was difficult to see at night around Sullivan St., as numerous cars drove up to the sidewalk.</p>
<p>"No one wears a mask in the street. If you did, it would be like you were showing less of your body than the others," said Jessica, a 23-year-old prostitute.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Taiwan has earned its place in World Health Assembly</b>
</div><div>Jonathan Manthorpe   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>739 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>D8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>Last week's invitation to Taiwan's health minister, Yeh Ching-chuan, to send a delegation of observers to the annual meeting of the World Health Assembly in Geneva has generated a predictable kaleidoscope of political pyrotechnics.</p>
<p>President Ma Ying-jeou of the ruling Kuomintang said the "breakthrough" invitation came as a result of his seeking a better working relationship with China since coming to power a year ago.</p>
<p>Ma says China, which has vetoed all Taiwan's attempts to join the United Nations' WHA since the island nation first applied in 1997, is showing goodwill because the new government has turned away from seeking international recognition of the island's de facto independence.</p>
<p>The pro-independence opposition Democratic Progressive Party in contrast accuses Ma of appeasing China, which claims to own Taiwan, and accepting a demeaning and subservient "observer" status at the WHA. And observer status, says the DPP, just gives Beijing the power to keep Taiwan in line by threatening to veto every year its continued participation in the WHA, governing body of the UN's World Health Organization.</p>
<p>Well, the politics of this situation will take care of itself.</p>
<p>There's actually good reason to think the decision to invite Taiwan to take part in the WHA has happened in spite of all the political shenanigans in Taiwan and in China, rather than because of them.</p>
<p>Taiwan, you see, has one of the finest health services in the world, especially when it comes to managing public health systems in the tropics and confronting diseases like malaria, influenzas and polio.</p>
<p>Indeed, in 2007 The Economist magazine's Intelligence Unit ranked Taiwan's health care and public health system second only to that of Sweden.</p>
<p>In an era of globalized infections, such as the current swine flu outbreak emanating from Mexico, international organizations like the WHA and the WHO would want Taiwan's experts and expertise involved in their teams.</p>
<p>In the last few days several international medical non-governmental organizations have said Taiwan is the best-prepared country in Asia to confront a swine flu pandemic and, unofficially, WHO officials have acknowledged this.</p>
<p>Just to underline the point, Taiwan's health minister Yeh is an epidemiologist and infectious diseases specialist who, along with China's Dr. Ho Mei-hsiang, blew the whistle on Beijing's attempts to keep quiet the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, SARS, in 2006.</p>
<p>For about a decade major international medical organizations have been pressing for Taiwan's inclusion in the WHA. These include the American Medical Association, Britain's Royal College of Surgeons and the International Nurses Federation, which has twice held annual meetings in Taiwan's capital Taipei.</p>
<p>And it's not just medical associations that have been pressing for Taiwan's participation in the WHA. Several governments including Canada, the European Union, Japan, the United States, Chile, Argentina and Brazil have all been saying for years that Taiwan's doctors and health experts are too important a global asset to be kept out of the WHA because of the political whims of Beijing.</p>
<p>Despite Beijing's indefatigable attempts to diplomatically isolate Taiwan and force the international community to accept Taiwan is a rebel province of China which must be united with the mainland at some point, many countries find the island's economic, social and intellectual achievements too important to ignore.</p>
<p>Taiwan has been swift to capitalize on its achievements. The government provides a host of training courses that are attended by public health officials, medical specialists and nurses from all over the world.</p>
<p>So Taiwan's inclusion in the WHA will likely allow the island's already substantial relationship with the international health fraternity to blossom even further.</p>
<p>It is easy to foresee that if Beijing did attempt in a year or so to block Taiwan's further participation in the WHA, it would be laughed out of court.</p>
<p>And then there are many other international organizations under the UN umbrella from which Taiwan is currently excluded because of Beijing's recalcitrance, but which could benefit from the island's expertise. Maritime and air transport law spring immediately to mind.</p>
<p>So let the politicians bicker and squabble. This invitation by the WHA has given an opening to Taiwan's 23 million people and they seldom if ever miss an opportunity.</p>

<p>RUSSIA AND THE AMERICAS.Protectionists sniff out a chance to slow imports</p>
<p>It is a great pity that the influenza outbreak emanating from Mexico was not named "the gerbil flu" or "the great crested newt flu." Indeed, it could have the name of any creature in which there is not an important global trade. Calling it "swine flu" has had the unfortunate result of exciting the protectionist urges of many bureaucrats and politicians, even though doctors are clear that no one has the slightest chance of catching the disease from pork. Japan -- always ambivalent about imported foodstuffs that might contest the market with lovingly nurtured domestic apples or hand-polished rice grains -- is banning all pork imports from North America. And the urge to control the market is especially strong in Russia where Marx has morphed into monopolistic mafia. So surgical masks had hardly been placed on faces in Mexico before Moscow announced that all meat products entering Russia from anywhere in the Americas will be subject to rigorous testing. So anyone from Baffin Island to Tierra del Fuego trying to feed the insatiable Russian meat market -- homegrown produce is scarce and third class -- is now at the mercy of the merciless but splendidly named food watchdog agency RosSelKhozNadzor.</p>
<p>CHINA. Peru latest country to sign free-trade deal with China</p>
<p>China's drive to weave a global network of economic partnerships continues apace despite -- and perhaps because of -- the recession. The latest country to find itself a spot in Beijing's firmament of commerce is Peru, which last week became the first Latin American nation to sign a comprehensive free trade agreement with China. China has, in fact, already got its FTA hooks into Latin America. It signed a limited agreement covering only trade in goods with Chile in 2005, which was supplemented by a trade deal on services in 2008.</p>
<p>Coastal Regions . Bank sounds warning on effects of global warming</p>
<p>The Asian Development Bank warned last week that global warming and rising sea levels could start knocking six per cent a year off the gross domestic product of several Southeast Asian countries. The current financial crisis will be nothing compared to the damage inflicted on countries such as Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam by rising sea waters. The bleak picture unrolled by the bank talks of dwindling food supplies as agricultural land is flooded, the forced relocation of millions of people from coastal communities, and a mounting death toll from "thermal stress," malaria and dengue fever. The bank urges Southeast Asian nations to invest in more efficient power, industrial and transportation systems, which could help cut its carbon emissions up to 40 per cent by 2020.</p>
<p>China. Millions of university grads can't find employment</p>
<p>China's latest production glut, sadly, is of university graduates for whom there are just not enough jobs in the current economic slump. About a third of last year's crop of 5.6 million university graduates have not found work. The situation is likely to be worse for the 6.1 million graduates entering the market this year and Beijing is getting worried about the effect these armies of disillusioned young people may have on social stability. The seeds of the current problem go back to 1998 when then prime minister and economics tsar Zhu Rongji decreed that China needed as many university graduates as possible. There were about 3.4 million Chinese at university at the time, but the degree industry has grown by about 30 per cent a year so that there are now about 21.5 million young Chinese in close to 2,200 universities.</p>

<p>For Moises Bonilla, watching the life of a feverish fellow patient slip away was the most depressing point of his five days in a flu quarantine ward.</p>
<p>Tubes had been inserted into the victim's throat in a futile effort to help her breathe and, as her body was wheeled away, he feared he too might never leave the hospital alive.</p>
<p>The jobless Mexican maintenance worker has an unprecedented insight into the flu epidemic that has swept the globe, with confirmed cases in 15 countries and a warning of a possible pandemic from the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>He was struck down with presumed H1N1 flu as the outbreak erupted in Mexico.</p>
<p>"When you watch someone die in front of you and you don't know if the same thing might await you, it's a shocking experience," he said from his apartment in the Mexico City borough of Iztapalapa.</p>
<p>He was released last week after treatment for flu-induced pneumonia in a hospital where the outbreak was so bad a doctor and nurse ended up as patients.</p>
<p>Although he has not heard the test results, he is being treated with oseltamivir, the generic name for the Tamiflu antivirals.</p>
<p>Bonilla started to feel ill on April 22 with a headache, running nose and sore throat.</p>
<p>"By the next day, I felt so bad that I thought my lungs were going to burst and my throat was closing up," he said.</p>
<p>That evening, he was watching the television news when the first reports emerged that a new mutant flu virus had been identified in Mexico.</p>
<p>Bonilla rushed to hospital where he was put into the emergency ward.</p>
<p>As other victims arrived, they were placed in seclusion and, on the second day, he saw the 39-year-old woman lose her fight for life.</p>
<p>Bonilla was treated at first with antibiotics but improved dramatically when he was given oseltamivir. Cut off from the outside world, he had no idea that he was at the centre of a flu outbreak that was making news worldwide.</p>
<p>But his wife, Blanca Estella Arcos, knew the danger her husband faced. She spent those five days at the hospital, snatching a few hours' sleep when she could as she waited for updates from the doctors.</p>
<p>"Everyone was talking about this killer flu and an epidemic so it was a terrifying and very anxious time to have my husband in there at death's door," she said, wiping away tears.</p>
<p>Bonilla is recuperating in the two-bedroom apartment where he lives with his wife, his daughters, aged 21 and 17, and granddaughters of three years and six months. None have shown any flu symptoms, although they have sent his grandchildren to stay with relatives.</p>
<p>The 46-year-old is a healthy strong man -- the classic profile for victims of swine flu which, like the Spanish Flu epidemic of 1918, has been affecting people in the prime of life.</p>
<p>He is in no doubt what brought him so close to death. "I'm sure it was swine flu. And if anybody has any doubt about how serious that is, I can tell you it's very real, awful and very dangerous."</p>
<p>Yet some Mexicans have reacted angrily to being identified with the swine flu virus. Such is the case with the family of Gerardo Leyva, a 39-year old from Xonocatlan. He died on April 20, when Mexicans had still heard nothing about swine flu.</p>
<p>After news of the virus broke three days later, his family was horrified to see Leyva was on the list of presumed victims.</p>
<p>"It was so ugly. First we had gone through this tragedy in the family," said his niece, Yazmin Cortes. "Then they were saying he was spreading this disease."</p>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization cautioned people on Sunday to avoid unnecessary contact with animals sick with the A H1N1 flu virus after more than 200 pigs on a central Alberta hog farm were found infected with human swine flu on the weekend.</p>
<p>An infectious disease expert in Hong Kong warned the risk of a flu pandemic has dramatically increased because of the infection of the herd, though experts in the U.S. and Mexico said they believe the current outbreak would continue to be mild and would be less serious than the 1968-69 Hong Kong flu pandemic that killed a million people worldwide.</p>
<p>It's believed the Alberta case is first time anywhere in the world the new H1N1 influenza A virus has been found in pigs.</p>
<p>The discovery had experts weighing in Sunday on what, if any, measures should be taken now that the virus has spread to animal herds.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a WHO official agreed the eating of pork is safe and said there are no plans to put down any of the 220 infected animals, who were only mildly ill and were recovering. The farm has been quarantined.</p>
<p>"At present there is no recommendation for culling," said Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, adding WHO officials will look into whether more control measures are needed to protect humans.</p>
<p>Canadian officials said consumers should not be concerned about the virus entering the food chain.</p>
<p>"We have determined that the virus, H1N1 influenza A, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population," Dr. Brian Evans, executive vice-president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Canada's chief veterinary officer, told reporters.</p>
<p>Federal officials believe the infected pigs contracted the virus from a Canadian farm worker who returned from Mexico on April 12 and returned to work, developing flu symptoms shortly thereafter. One other person on the farm has had mild symptoms.</p>
<p>"The chance that these pigs could transfer the virus to a person is remote," Evans said, stressing there is "no food-safety concern related to this finding. Pig farms are typically closed to visitors since swine easily catch human diseases.</p>
<p>Experts say consumption of pork is safe, as cooking to the recommended 70 C kills all viruses.</p>
<p>Dr. Ho Pak-leung, associate professor at University of Hong Kong's microbiology department, says the H1N1 virus will become increasingly difficult to control if more pigs are infected.</p>
<p>There's also a high risk the virus can mutate inside infected pigs, creating new strains of flu, he said. The transfer of a flu virus from humans to pigs has happened before. The Hong Kong flu also transferred from humans to pigs, and vice versa, during the 1968-69 pendemic.</p>
<p>"A single pig can be infected with different influenza viruses," he says. "So, there's a chance that the genes of the influenza virus may 'shuffle' inside the pigs ... forming a new virus."</p>
<p>However, Ho stresses that pork products are safe to eat, since the H1N1 disease cannot be contracted from eating cooked pork, as the flu virus is killed at temperatures of 70 C.</p>
<p>Despite that, the Philippines, El Salvador, Honduras and Ukraine have stopped accepting Canadian pork since the H1N1 cases were identified in Canada, while South Korea is not accepting live hogs.</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz urged Canada's trading partners to make decisions based on "sound science," not emotion.</p>
<p>Jack Wessel, manager of B.C. pork producers association, said there have been no cases of the new flu in pigs here.</p>
<p>"There is absolutely no transference of H1N1 from swine to people in B.C.," he said.</p>
<p>But "it shows you that the interface between man and animal needs to be watched carefully," said Roy Wadea of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Jurgen Preugschas, chairman of Canadian Pork Council, said on Sunday the Canadian government, agricultural departments and health departments are all working together to ensure the safety of pig herds.</p>
<p>"We have sent out to all our member provinces and producers a notice to heighten alert bio-security measures that prevent bringing organisms or diseases into the barn," he said</p>
<p>Preugschas said it is standard procedure for workers to shower and change footwear and clothing before entering a barn, to minimize risk of bringing any viruses or bacteria into barns.</p>
<p>The case in Alberta where a worker infected with the H1N1 virus ocurred before the public was aware of the swine flu outbreak, he said.</p>
<p>B.C. NOW HAS 29 CONFIRMED CASES OF SWINE FLU</p>
<p>B.C. now has 29 confirmed cases of swine flu, Roy Wadea of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control said Sunday.</p>
<p>That's an increase of seven from the day before.</p>
<p>There are no children among the new cases -- all are adults ranging in age from mid-20s to mid-50s. With the exception of two that are still being investigated, all cases are believed related to travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>"We have seen some secondary retransmission," said Wadea. "At this moment we are seeing more cases."</p>
<p>Wadea said it is likely the province will see more cases in the coming days and weeks.</p>
<p>Although all the new swine flu cases in B.C. are characterized as "mild," Wadea said there is "no room for complacency. The virus can take a turn and become more virulent or less virulent."</p>
<p>Vancouver Sun</p>
<p>THE FLU OUTBREAK</p>
<p>DEVELOPMENTS</p>
<p>Cases: By Sunday,18 countries had officially reported 898 confirmed cases of A(H1N1) flu infections and 20 confirmed deaths (19 Mexico; one U.S.).</p>
<p>Many of those people are already well again; much of the increase in confirmed cases comes as backlogged lab work is completed. In the epicentre of the outbreak, Mexico, the number of new cases continues to drop sharply as infection-control measures, including a five-day shutdown of non-essential businesses, take effect.</p>
<p>Prognosis: The WHO organization says it has not seen a sustained spread of the swine flu virus outside North America, but that a pandemic was still "imminent." U.S. and British experts says this flu may follow past pattern -- die out quickly now due to warmer weather, but return with a more deadly attack when fall flu season arrives in the northern hemisphere. Officials expect to have a vaccine developed by then. This flu is killing fewer people and producing milder symptoms than the world's previous influenza outbreaks, an "encouraging" sign for an illness that is spreading easily, a top U.S. heath official said.</p>
<p>AROUND THE GLOBE</p>
<p>World: The World Health Organization has confirmed the disease in these countries: Mexico, the U.S., Canada, Austria, Costa Rica, Denmark, France, Germany, China (Hong Kong), Ireland, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, South Korea, Spain, Switzerland, and the U.K.</p>
<p>Canada: Officials reported 16 new cases Sunday and 34 on Saturday, bringing Canada's total to 101. B.C. now has 29 confirmed cases, with seven new ones reported Sunday. Manitoba reported its first case. Most of the new weekend cases come from Nova Scotia, where 17 were reported, another seven were from Alberta, plus four in Ontario, and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>"We continue to see mild cases and full recovery in Canada, but our vigilance and efforts need to continue, and our heightened surveillance will lead to more and more confirmed cases," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said.</p>
<p>U.S.: Confirmed cases reach 226 in 30 states, including last week's death of a Mexican child in Texas, U.S. officials said. An official with the Centers for Disease Control said Sunday doctors believe the virus is widespread among young people but that "most of those people are recovering."</p>
<p>China: Mexico directed its anger at China, which it said was "unjustly" singling out Mexicans because of their nationality rather than whether they were infected. Mexican diplomats in China said 70 of their nationals had been placed under quarantine there despite showing no signs of swine flu. Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa has warned Mexicans against visiting China.</p>
<p>Mexico reported that 24.1% of its cases were in children ages 0-9, 23.7% among those 10-19, 19.4% in those 20-29, 13.6% in those 30-39, 10.1% in those 40-49, 6.6% in those 50-59 and 1.8% in those 60-plus.</p>
<p>AVERAGE FLU</p>
<p>In Canada, the average annual flu season makes thousands of people sick and kills an average of 4,000 Canadians every year. Normally, fewer than 0.1 per cent of people with influenza die, unless they have underlying medical conditions.</p>

</p>
<p>There's a large number of disappointed players this week after the Canadian Tour decided to play it on the safe side and postpone the San Luis Potosi Open down Mexico way.</p>
<p>Originally, the tour was going to go on with the event and keep spectators off the course but once the swine flu outbreak level was raised to pandemic status, tour officials called it off and hustled the players out of the country.</p>
<p>Among those leaving were Calgary's Wes Heffernan, James Love and Ryan Yip.</p>
<p>"No one wants to talk about anything else," said Heffernan, the three-time Alberta Open champion, in a recent e-mail. "It is so blown out of proportion down here. There are only four confirmed cases in San Luis Potosi out of 1.3 million people."</p>
<p>Nevertheless, better safe than sorry and we'll look forward to seeing the Calgary gang at both the Open at Carnmoney at the end of next month and the tour's ATB Financial Classic at Sirocco during July.</p>
<p>Heavy Hitting</p>
<p>Golf is all about feel and confidence. The more you have, the better you play.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind, we can hardly wait to get at it now that Yours Truly has his hands on the new mid-weight Heavy Putter from Boccieri Golf.</p>
<p>We've heard numerous reports about the original Heavy Putter for some time, but to actually experience one, especially the new, lighter mid-weight model, is pure joy.</p>
<p>You've probably seen this weapon being wielded by any number of pros on the PGA Tour, LPGA Tour, Champions Tour or Nationwide Tour, among others, as they carve out low numbers en route to victories. But you probably haven't heard the Heavy Putter name because it isn't officially endorsed and mere mention of it is a no-no.</p>
<p>Too bad because it's a dandy.</p>
<p>Living up to its name, the original model checks in at up to a whopping 975 grams, while the new mid-weight is 750 grams. Still heavy but it swings sweet. It takes a wee bit of getting used to, like any new club, but with most of the weight in the handle, it feels like your arms are a pendulum. Take it back and let it go. Bingo!</p>
<p>Five head models in the new mid-weight series from a Ping-like goose neck blade through mallets to the straight blade.</p>
<p>So why am I excited . . . of 15 putts from eight to 10 feet, 12 fell in the hole! Now that's sweet.</p>
<p>Whitefish Beckons</p>
<p>One of the more popular southern golf destinations for Albertans has long been Montana, and especially the not-so-far-away Flathead Valley.</p>
<p>Lisa Jones, who works for the Whitefish Visitors Bureau, drops a note to say the 36 holes at Whitefish Lake opened April 22. Early season fees are $38. Two-day advance tee times at Whitefish or any of the other Flathead courses can be booked by calling 1-800-392-9795.</p>

<p>Juniors Invade</p>
<p>The Canadian Junior Golf Association slid into Alberta for its first tournament this past weekend with a double qualifier at River Spirit.</p>
<p>Up for grabs among the young hopefuls were valuable points toward the seventh annual Lipton Brisk Canada Cup, a Ryder Cupstyle event July 27-30 at Toronto's Donalda club, in which East plays West.</p>
<p>Four boys from each age bracket, as well as two girls, will form each team, to be eventually chosen by a CJGA selection committee using cross-Canada tournament results as fodder.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, national team development members Albin Choi and Jennifer Kirby, both of Ontario, took top honours in the Future Links Pacific championship held at Morningstar in Parksville, B. C.</p>
<p>Choi, despite a wonky ankle, finished off with a final round 66 to be the only competitor at par or better as he edged fellow development team member Julien Goulet of St. Roch de l'Achigan, Que., by one shot. Reigning Canadian junior champ Mitch Sutton of London, Ont., was in a tie for third spot another two shots back.</p>
<p>Kirby posted a four-shot victory over SooBin Kim of Port Coquitlam, B. C. despite a closing five-over 77.</p>
<p>Top Albertans among the boys were Carson Kallis of Red Deer and Scott Malo of Calgary, tied for ninth at 224. There were no Alberta girls listed in the top 27.</p>
<p>Chip Shots: Geez, who knew? We threw that off-the-wall thought out there last week about where one might like to have his/ her ashes spread on a golf course and the response has been overwhelming . . . The annual Riley's Media-Manager bash is set for Canyon Meadows today but we have to take a pass due to some serious Hitmen-Rockets playoff hockey tonight in Kelowna.</p>

</p>
<p>As humanity struggles to come to grips with the H1N1 virus, an even deadlier strain has been making its way across the globe since 2001.</p>
<p>As doctors and health ministries attempt to mitigate the effects of the swine flu, investigators in a number of countries have been fighting an infection that is much more dangerous, even if its effects have so far been felt by a relative few.</p>
<p>The epidemic is torture, the government of the United States is the most visible patient in recent days, and the this viral strain, if left unchecked, threatens to decimate the freedoms and privileges won by generations of men and women across the Atlantic.</p>
<p>Proactive strategies range from mitigation (we will only do it in these instances), to containment (we will not do it anymore), to finding a cure (holding those who torture fully accountable).</p>
<p>But this is not simple. For one, this is often billed as an American problem with American consequences, even though America's prominence in global affairs makes such "moral containment" dubious at best. If North Korea tortures, it re-mains a North Korean problem. If America tortures, the entire world is at risk.</p>
<p>Already, a number of America's allies have begun to work through their own torture scandals, in which their own intelligence services and governments are usually implicated.</p>
<p>For example, according to the Red Cross, press reports, a number of whistleblowers, and an ongoing investigation by the public prosecutor's office, America's torture pol-icy led to abuses in Poland, where the CIA maintained a secret prison in the northeast of the country.</p>
<p>It is there that investigators believe Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was water-boarded exactly 183 times in one month, or roughly six times each day, and although the flight records and witness statements are beginning to reveal the nature of the prison, it remains unclear who in Poland's government of the day made the agreement with the Americans, and who should ultimately be held accountable.</p>
<p>In Italy, the situation is marginally better because the torture did not occur on Italian soil. Still, CIA officers kidnapped cleric Hassan Mustafa Osama Nasr from a street in Milan in 2003, and flew him to Egypt where he was questioned and allegedly tortured. It is believed that Italy's own intelligence agency assisted with the operation, and both American and Italian officers are currently facing trial where their only credible line of defence has been an endless invocation of state secrets clauses in the name of security.</p>
<p>British secret services directly fed questions to CIA interrogators in Morocco, a state repeatedly cited by human rights groups as a torture regime. Ex-Guantanamo detainee Binyam Mohamed was allegedly tortured there, and an investigation is currently under-way to figure out Britain's complicity.</p>
<p>Canada's role in the American "rendition" of Maher Arar, an innocent engineer who was tortured after being transferred to a Syrian prison while passing through an American airport in September 2002, shows that Canadians are not immune either.</p>
<p>Even Arar's saga did not stop Canada from requesting that Sudan detain Abousfian Abdelrazik from Montreal, and has not forced our government to repatriate him despite credible allegations of CIA involvement and torture, this time performed in the facilities of a regime that the U. S. government itself has called genocidal.</p>
<p>Some of these examples involve the abuse of men who were guilty of grave crimes, while Maher Arar's case is the perfect example of what can happen to an innocent man. Yet guilty or innocent, all these examples show just how quickly the torture virus has infected the western way of government, and how difficult it will be to administer the cure.</p>
<p>If we -- not just America, but "we the people of the western world" -- are to maintain the freedoms that have made us the example for the rest of the world, there is only one remedy, the rule of law. Yet, this requires clarity, honesty, and accountability, something that a number of officials from Washington, London or Warsaw fear just as much as their counterparts in Damascus, Rabat or Khartoum.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, if the torture virus is to be defeated, the rule of law offers the only cure. And, if our collective immune system proves too weak to withstand torture, the virus of dictatorship and tyranny will surely follow.</p>

<p>T he suspected narcos were paraded before the media with a telling new accessory: masks. Not the bank-robber kind. The doctor kind.</p>
<p>After all, even gangsters toting M-16s can get the flu.</p>
<p>If the swine flu epidemic in Mexico has a dominant symbol, it is the surgical mask, or tapaboca, that millions of Mexicans have adopted as requisite wear despite conflicting advice about whether it does any good.</p>
<p>Soldiers have handed out millions of the facial shields, which come in blue, white and hospital-scrubs green. Pharmacies in Mexico City ran out as opportunists hoarded them to sell on the street for as much as $3.50 apiece--about 50 times the normal price.</p>
<p>Newspapers here have carried graphics showing how to turn a piece of scrap cloth into a mask.</p>
<p>Some people have tried to add a splash of personality by painting their masks with skeleton faces or colourful butterflies.</p>
<p>In a land where workaday laws are regularly ignored, Mexico City residents are pretty much obeying the government's call to don tapabocas in public places as a way to prevent the spread of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>President Felipe Calderon was on national television the other night, reminding Mexicans to please cover their mouths.</p>
<p>(Or, if they lacked a mask or handkerchief, to cough or sneeze into the crook of their arm. He even showed how.)</p>
<p>"I know that thanks to your systematically using the face mask, you have succeeded in reducing the chance of infection in the population,"Calderon said, mask-less, from his official residence.</p>
<p>"I think it's a responsibility," said Soledad Perez, a house-cleaner in the upscale Polanco section, who was wearing a mask.</p>
<p>But even while Calderon was urging Mexicans to cover up, his government's top epidemiologist, Miguel Angel Lezana, was at a gathering of foreign journalists and pooh-poohing the use of masks.</p>
<p>Many health experts have said that the flimsy nose-and-mouth covers available to most consumers are too leaky to block the virus.</p>
<p>Lezana said the government was passing out mil-lions mainly because residents asked for them.</p>
<p>"It makes them feel safer to have the masks, and, besides, it doesn't do any harm," Lezana said.</p>
<p>That essentially leaves it to Mexicans to come up with their own reasons to cover up or not -- reasons that often have as much to do with manners as public health.</p>
<p>Walking into a store with a bare face can make you feel a bit like you've lighted a cigarette in the lung ward.</p>
<p>One commentator suggested that science was beside the point:Mask wearing, even if futile, is fundamentally an act of respect and solidarity.</p>
<p>Other people have settled on a hybrid approach: covering when stuck in close quarters with lots of people, such as on the subway, but not bothering in less-crowded public settings.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Concerts cancelled in Mexico over flu; Promoters develop backup plans in case health scare drags on</b>
</div><div>Billboard</div>

</p>
<p>In the wake of the recent swine flu outbreak, <span class="companylink">Ticketmaster</span>'s Mexican website resembled an airport departure screen during a snowstorm, with rows of concert listings followed by the same word: "Cancelado."</p>
<p>To help contain the outbreak, the Mexican government banned public events in Mexico City, issued advisories against gatherings in other parts of the country and closed schools nationwide.</p>
<p>That left music promoters and managers scrambling to postpone shows until after May 6, when schools are scheduled to reopen.</p>
<p>Alejandro Fernandez, Marco Antonio Solis, Los Lobos and Alejandra Guzman are just a few of the acts that have been affected by the cancellations of cultural festivals, theatre and sports events. The Jonas Brothers and Metallica are still scheduled to perform sold-out shows in Monterrey and Mexico City, respectively.</p>
<p>Though suspected swine flu cases have been reported as far away as New Zealand, the higher number of deaths attributed to the disease in Mexico set off a swift reaction by the live entertainment industry.</p>
<p>An April 24 show by the Finnish group the Rasmus at Mexico City's Auditorio Nacional was cancelled, while an April 25 concert by the Mexican pop act Ha-Ash at the same venue was rescheduled for May 7.</p>
<p>"We will be working normally once the health authorities confirm that this warning has been released," said Francisco Serrano Carreto, director of the Auditorio's sister venue Lunario.</p>
<p>Others in the live music industry also expressed optimism that things would return to normal after May 6, but some on both sides of the border were developing backup plans in case health fears don't subside by then.</p>
<p>John Frias, whose company is promoting a May 9 triple bill of the regional Mexican acts Los Temerarios, K-Paz de la Sierra and Pancho Barraza in Anaheim, Calif., said tickets had been moving briskly as of last weekend.</p>
<p>Still, Frias said he'd be taking note of attendance at Cinco de Mayo celebrations to assess whether he should reschedule his concert, given his target audience of Mexican immigrants and Mexican-Americans, many of whom may have recently travelled south of the border.</p>
<p>"That's going to be a huge indication for us ... if we haven't made a decision by then," Frias said.</p>
<p>Chris del Rey, producer of a May 3 Cinco de Mayo music festival in South El Monte, Calif., was heartened by the strong turnout at Los Angeles's Fiesta Broadway a week earlier.</p>
<p>Del Rey said a free all-day concert featuring top acts and product samples from grocery sponsors may attract more families than ever in an economic crisis.</p>
<p>"If anything," del Rey said, "they need an outlet with all this bad news."</p>

<p>Re: "School trips felled by flu fears; Band students return home after just one day in California," The Journal, April 30.</p>
<p>The travel restrictions imposed by the Edmonton Public and Catholic school boards are pure knee-jerk stupidity.</p>
<p>Swine flu is far from a pandemic, as far as I'm concerned. I am 16 years old, attend Jasper Place High School and had my Bloomsday trip cancelled because of this decision.</p>
<p>I trained for five months to prepare for this race. I ran hills, stairs, inside, outside; I ran when it was below zero and snowing with ice covering the sidewalks. I sacrificed shifts at work and social time with friends in order to train. I woke up early on Sunday mornings in order to run. I drove to the Kinsmen running room -- more than a little inconvenient with the state of the Whitemud these days.</p>
<p>I paid $320 to cover the cost of food, transportation and hotel rooms. I watched what I ate in order to be as well prepared as possible for the race.</p>
<p>Not that I expect the school board to understand how much I sacrificed. My trustee doesn't even have the decency to reply to an e-mail I sent him.</p>

<p>Re: "Canada prepared for pandemic: health official; More cases reported on eve of national public awareness campaign," The Journal, May 1.</p>
<p>Where does the World Health Organization get off preparing to call the swine flu a pandemic? If the swine flu is a pandemic, then what does that make the regular flu? Some 13,000 people have died from the regular flu in the U.S. alone since January.</p>
<p>You have a greater chance of getting hit by lightning than dying from the swine flu. Yes, some 400 people worldwide have gotten the swine flu, but only about 10 have died.</p>
<p>Pandemic? Ha. Enough with the fearmongering.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The health of a city; Ottawa has been shaped over the years by the struggle to keep its citizens safe from disease</b>
</div><div>Phil Jenkins   </div>
<div>Citizen Special</div>
<div>962 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>There are many ways to write the history of a city, and one of the more interesting ones is to pick a thread and follow it down through the years. Although it smacks of the morbid, one useful line to pick upon is the city's collective health, or lack of it.</p>
<p>Even as it was being founded, baby Bytown suffered from a cholera outbreak among the canal workers in 1832, and there have been several reoccurrences of typhoid epidemics and mini-epidemics since, beginning with the holy battle Mère Elizabeth Bruyère and her small band of Grey Nuns waged with the "ship fever" in working-class Lowertown in 1847.</p>
<p>In 1911, Dr. Robert Law, an outstanding gentleman in our health history and at that time the acting medical officer of health, had to wrestle with another outbreak that followed on from untreated sewage infiltrating the city's drinking water. That, of course, is a problem we modern Ottawans don't face anymore, except if sturgeon as big as a man from the river are part of your diet.</p>
<p>Seven years and a Great War later, on Sept. 26, 1918, a rampaging influenza epidemic notched up what appeared to be its first victim in Ottawa. The disease was called the Spanish flu, the supposed starting point of the epidemic being Spain. But this is a misnomer, because in all likelihood the thing got started in South China, in an area where tightly packed humans, birds and pigs were all sharing. In 1918, Chinese workers were hired by the warring allied nations to dig trenches in the killing fields -- probably history's most bizarre make-work project -- and they may very well have brought it with them. Add to that the fact that exhausted, stressed young men were the disease's favourite choice of host, and the makings were there for a big push westward.</p>
<p>The war timed its ending beautifully, from the flu's point of view, and the troop ships gave it a free ride to new pastures, to ports such as Boston and Halifax. From Halifax, the demobbed soldiers pulled into the train stations of Ottawa, to the Broad Street station on LeBreton Flats, the McTaggart Street station and the Grand Trunk or Union station, which is still there, opposite the National Arts Centre, twiddling its thumbs.</p>
<p>It was the tendency of train stations then to be surrounded by the working-class (read poorer) citizens, and history has ample proof of the inverse relationship between wealth and illness. In terms of the ethnic map of Ottawa then, this meant that the French and Irish Catholic populations were the hardest hit, as the number of deaths in the city from "dancing with the Spanish lady" climbed into the hundreds. In the month of October, 440 hasty funerals were held across the city, and the final ghastly tally was more than 500.</p>
<p>In the aftermath of the epidemic, Dr. Law set his considerable energies to making sure the surviving population truly understood the relationship between domestic hygiene and personal health. As he put it at the time, "To teach people to dwell sanitarily in their home is a matter for education by the press, the schools and through the advice of the tactful visiting of a district nurse. It is up to the health authorities to show the people how to live." True then and true now. That advice has gone down through the years, and subsequent health officers -- for example Dr. Robert Cushman in the middle of this decade who worked so hard to get cigarette smoke out of the air -- have worked on the medical side of Ottawa's reputation as a clean city. If our nickname is the Big Clean, let's take it. It may prove to be a life-saver.</p>
<p>The mayor at the time of the 1918 pandemic, Harold Fisher was anxious in the wake of the epidemic to have a big modern hospital. Using uncommon foresight for a mayor, he decided to locate beyond the then western edge of town, an act that earned the project the name "Fisher's Folly." But time has proved him right, and the Civic, which opened in 1924 with coincidentally as many beds as people who had died in the epidemic, is now right about in the middle of town.</p>
<p>A century after the flu of 1918, a new version has broken out, and in the months to come, there may or may not be a sharp increase in those of us who join the ranks of the critically unhealthy, and even those in the graveyards and crematoriums. The top of the news these days is an evolving chart of the numbers and the geography of the latest swine flu cases and deaths, the statistical bulletins of the flu's progress. This time it is not a war that has humanity -- and the piggy-backing germ -- on the move, but modern travel.</p>
<p>It is being muted in the media that a Mexican piggery with crappy practices may have been where the mutant virus was conceived, so again we have the scenario of a dense population in unhealthy conjunction with swine.</p>
<p>Here in Ottawa, we are well braced for wherever the numbers may go, and history has helped us get there.</p>

<p>Virologist Earl Brown is more intrigued than most by the "mongrel" virus spreading across the planet.</p>
<p>The University of Ottawa scientist usually has to set up elaborate animal experiments to create virulent new forms of the flu. Now, says Brown, "reality is the laboratory."</p>
<p>He and his colleagues around the world are already busy poring over the genes inside the virus that has emerged from a Mexican breeding ground, raising the spectre of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Gene sequences from dozens of the viruses, isolated from infected people around the globe, have been posted to a research website in the past week, enabling scientists to track changes and mutations.</p>
<p>"There is already a small bit of change occurring," says microbiologist Dr. David Farrell at the Ontario Public Health Laboratories in Toronto. His team is working well into the night these days to identify viruses Ontario travellers have brought home.</p>
<p>The tests entail sequencing genes inside the viruses. When they confirm H1N1 swine flu, they pass the gene sequence on to the U.S. National Institutes of Health, and GenBank, where sequences from several countries are available for comparison.</p>
<p>The genetic information helps fine-tune tests for detecting the worrisome virus and determine which drugs may be most effective at fighting it, says Farrell.</p>
<p>The gene sequences also provide important clues about the origins of the virus, and may lead back to the "smoking pig," says Brown, executive director of the Emerging Pathogens Research Centre at the University of Ottawa.</p>
<p>The new virus is said to be a mix of four types of flu: North American swine influenza, North American avian influenza, human influenza, and a swine influenza virus typically found in Asia and Europe. Pigs crammed into factory farms in Mexico are believed to have been the "mixing vessel."</p>
<p>Brown says it is too early to know how virulent "this swine mongrel" will be. Typically, flu kills one of every 10,000 people infected. But highly virulent varieties, such as the 1918 flu, killed two of every 100 people it infected.</p>
<p>"The big question here is what the mortality is going to be," says Brown, who specializes in viral evolution and sits on federal flu advisory committees.</p>
<p>So far, the infections in Canada and the U.S. appear to have been no worse than normal flu. But there have reportedly been dozens of deaths in Mexico among young adults.</p>
<p>Influenza is spread through close contact -- a cough or sneeze from an infected individual can send thousands of the tiny microbes into the air.</p>
<p>Once in the cell, the virus strips off its coat. Its genes, "all naked and exposed," hijack the cell's machinery and instruct it to make more viral proteins and genes, Brown says. "When there is enough of everything, they assemble and a new virus pops out."</p>
<p>The process is so efficient a single virus can multiply into 3,000 new ones.</p>
<p>World attention is now focused on the Mexican virus, but Brown says it is just a symptom of a much bigger problem. In the last 10 years, several flu viruses have emerged containing genetic mixtures of bird, swine and human influenza viruses. Canine influenza has also emerged, having jumped from horses to greyhounds at racetracks. A particularly nasty strain of avian, or bird flu, in Asia has been a growing concern and millions of birds have been slaughtered to prevent it from spreading. Until now, swine farms in Mexico have been largely off the radar, says Brown, noting that influenza surveillance does not appear to have been a priority in that country.</p>

<p>MEXICO CITY --</p>
<p>Mexico says it is winning a battle against a deadly new swine flu virus and the global health alert triggered an international trade dispute Monday over some nations' bans on Mexican, U.S. and Canadian pork.</p>
<p>As infections of the new A H1N1 flu strain, now seen in 21 countries, continued to be crop up across the globe, the World Health Organization wavered over whether it might declare a full pandemic alert.</p>
<p>Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak of the new virus strain, said it was over the worst of its own emergency and prepared to resume some restricted business activities in Mexico City after a partial five-day shutdown.</p>
<p>But new international tensions triggered by the virus, which contains mostly swine components with bits of human and avian influenzas, emerged after about 20 nations banned imports of pork, pigs and other meat from the United States, Canada and Mexico, the three most flu-affected countries.</p>
<p>Canada threatened to take China to the World Trade Organization unless Beijing backed down from its ban on imports of pigs and pork from Alberta province, where a herd of pigs was found to have the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>While the new H1N1 virus is not food borne, fears it may spread through animal products have prompted restrictions on live pigs, pork, cattle, poultry, livestock, feed and animal semen from countries with infections.</p>
<p>U.S. hog futures fell on Monday and meat packing companies cut pork production this weekend amid the import bans and an apparent slide in retail orders due to the H1N1 flu, which has also caused exports from Canada to tumble.</p>
<p>WHO chief Margaret Chan said the apparent good news from Mexico over the epidemic had to be treated with caution.</p>
<p>“Flu viruses are very unpredictable, very deceptive ... We should not be over-confident,” she said. “One must not give H1N1 the opportunity to mix with other viruses.”</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people in 21 countries have caught what has become known as the swine flu, but United Nations chief Ban Ki-moon said WHO does not plan to raise its pandemic alert to the highest level if the current outbreak of the new strain of flu continues as is.</p>
<p>However, epidemic experts warned that while the impact on world health appeared to be relatively mild at present, the fast-mutating flu could come back with a vengeance later.</p>
<p>“The next year it may break out in wild ways,” said Dr. C.J. Peters, a microbiologist at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston and specialist in emerging infectious diseases. “If we don't pay attention to this outbreak as a bad actor, we could be very, very sorry.”</p>
<p>In the United States, the second biggest focus of infection after Mexico, the new virus has now infected 286 people in 36 states, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.</p>
<p>Before issuing a level 6 pandemic alert, WHO would need to see the virus spreading within communities in Europe or Asia.</p>
<p>“We are not there yet ... No one can say right now how the pandemic will evolve, or indeed whether we are going into a pandemic,” Ms. Chan told a UN General Assembly session.</p>
<p>Last week, the WHO had signalled a pandemic was “imminent” by raising its alert level to 5 in recognition of the spread of the virus in Mexico and in the United States and Canada.</p>
<p>But European finance ministers said they saw no evidence the H1N1 flu was hurting Europe's economy.</p>
<p>In Mexico, many offices and businesses stayed closed to try to prevent the spread of the new strain of H1N1 swine flu.</p>
<p>But Mexican President Felipe Calderon has said the outbreak in the Latin American oil producer that has killed 26 people there so far and made a further 701 ill is stabilizing.</p>
<p>Mexico's peso made its biggest gains in over six months on Monday and stocks jumped as fears eased about the outbreak's economic impact.</p>
<p>Mexico's government is preparing this week to ease curbs on business and social activity imposed under the flu alert, which have shut down much of public life in Mexico City since May 1.</p>
<p>Many Mexicans, chafing after days of isolation at home, are desperate to get back to work after a period of inactivity that has hit family incomes at a time of global recession.</p>
<p>“We hope they lift this as soon as possible, because it's affecting the economy ... It's going to be a disaster if this carries on,” said Martin Velasquez, 28, a construction worker.</p>
<p>In a brewing diplomatic dispute between Mexico and China over the treatment of Mexican citizens caught up in the flu alert, Mexico was sending a plane to retrieve dozens of its nationals quarantined by Chinese authorities.</p>
<p>Mexico accused Beijing of discrimination against Mexicans, but China's Foreign Ministry rejected the criticism.</p>

<p>TORONTO --</p>
<p>More than 1,000 people have become victim to the new swine influenza A H1N1 virus, but global health authorities don't plan on raising the pandemic alert system to its highest level because there is no evidence of sustained, community-level outbreaks outside North America.</p>
<p>There have been 1,025 laboratory confirmed cases, including 26 deaths, and the cases have been seen in 20 countries, said Keiji Fukuda, acting assistant director-general for health security and environment at the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>“We continue to see a number of infections related to travel in a number of different countries,” Dr. Fukuda said today in a conference call from Geneva.</p>
<p>“We do not have any evidence that the virus has taken hold and has led to community-level transmissions in any other countries right now [outside North America].”</p>
<p>Health authorities continue to monitor the virus especially as southern hemisphere countries, which have largely escaped infections, could become more vulnerable as they now enter their influenza season. The virus continues to spread to a number of countries in the northern hemisphere, as well.</p>
<p>“It's not that surveillance has to be strong just in the southern hemisphere. It really needs to be strong everywhere,” Dr. Fukuda said.</p>
<p>“If it does move to the southern hemisphere, we could see outbreaks within the next several days, we could see outbreaks in the next several weeks or maybe longer than [that]. It is simply hard to predict on these things, and we're careful to try not to create any false expectations.”</p>
<p>Among the 26 deaths, one has been in the United States and the others in Mexico, the epicentre of the virus.</p>
<p>Canada has 104 cases, with Prince Edward Island confirming its first two cases of swine flu today. The cases in Canada have all been relatively mild.</p>
<p>The WHO raised its pandemic alert level twice last week. To raise it to level 6, a full-blown pandemic, Dr. Fukuda said health officials would need to see sustained transmission of the virus is a different region of the world. So far, almost all of the cases have been related to travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Experts are trying to understand why the virus has led to pneumonia and death in some young people, who are not normally hit hard by seasonal flu. Also, Dr. Fukuda said they are looking to answer why the new strain has led to diarrhea in almost half the cases, which is also not commonly reported in typical flu.</p>
<p>“We're not quite certain how this is going to evolve,” Dr. Fukuda told reporters.</p>
<p>In Mexico, officials lowered their flu alert level in the capital and said they will allow cafes, museums and libraries to reopen this week. Mexican officials declared the epidemic to be waning, announcing that Wednesday will conclude a five-day closure of non-essential businesses that was called to stop the spread of the new virus. Health officials still need to finish inspecting schools before students can return to class.</p>
<p>But countries still remain on high alert for the virus. And now Canada's pork industry is bearing the brunt of it.</p>
<p>The flu was discovered in pigs on a central Alberta farm where it apparently was passed onto the animals by a farm worker who had recently travelled to Mexico. China has banned Alberta pork, despite health officials including the WHO stressing that the health risk posed by infected pigs is negligible.</p>
<p>Canada's minister of international trade Stockwell Day said the ban is “disappointing and unwarranted.”</p>

<p>The lights suddenly go out.</p>
<p>At first, you think it is a regular power outage. Hours later, you realize it's not that simple. A massive disaster has affected the power grid across a huge swath of the province.</p>
<p>Emergency crews are working in overdrive, but services are not likely to be restored for a while.</p>
<p>Are you prepared? What supplies do you have in your home? What is your plan?</p>
<p>This is not something most people in this region have thought about since the blackout of Aug. 14, 2003, when 50 million North Americans were plunged into darkness by the failure of a transmission line in Ohio.</p>
<p>That blackout was short-lived, but what if it had lasted longer? And what about other disasters, such as a massive summer storm or tornado?</p>
<p>That is what authorities would like families to think about this week, which is National Emergency Preparedness week, said Bryan Stortz, acting manager of emergency measures for the Region of Waterloo.</p>
<p>"Most events that we are at risk for in this part of Ontario are weather related," Stortz said.</p>
<p>That includes not only tornadoes and wind storms that can hit quite suddenly, but also drought and extreme heat, as well as chemical spills and anything that can affect the water supply.</p>
<p>People don't normally think about drought as a disaster, but in a region dependent on wells for water, drought is in fact "a number one risk," Stortz said.</p>
<p>As part of emergency preparedness, it is recommended that people have a three-day supply of bottled water and food on hand.</p>
<p>"We recommend the necessary supplies to get through three days because that would presumably give the local municipalities time to get services functioning again," Stortz said.</p>
<p>The region has a website at www.wrem.ca[http://www.wrem.ca] that is devoted to the possible emergencies and disasters, including a 72-hour "emergency preparedness guide" from Public Safety Canada, a document that people can fill out online or download.</p>
<p>Stortz said it is important for families to work through the guide together and make plans for different scenarios, such as where to meet in case telephone communication is down and they need to find each other. It is impossible to prepare for everything, but "if families have their own plan in place for a major emergency, then if something should come up, it will answer a lot of their questions in advance," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, local officials have a highly co-ordinated approach to emergency response that includes representatives from all the municipalities, the region, the utilities, the hospitals, police and fire officials, Stortz said.</p>
<p>"We have a high level of co-operation and collaboration that has served us well and in the past and will serve us well should something happen tomorrow," Stortz said, adding that this region also has a "first-class" emergency pandemic response plan in case something like the current H1N1 flu becomes a serious emergency here.</p>
<p>PLANNING FOR AN EMERGENCY</p>
<p>Here are some important items to consider in preparing an emergency kit and plan. A complete guide is available at www.wrem.ca[http://www.wrem.ca]:</p>
<p>Food and bottled water for three days</p>
<p>Flashlight, radio, fresh batteries</p>
<p>Candles, matches, lighter</p>
<p>Blankets</p>
<p>Backpack</p>
<p>Cash in small bills (in case bank machines are not operational.)</p>
<p>A "grab and go" bag with a supply of necessary medications, in case pharmacies are not open</p>
<p>Identification; health information; a phone list of important contact numbers (relatives, doctor, etc.)</p>
<p>Extra clothing and footwear.</p>
<p>Plan of escape routes from your house and your neighbourhood</p>
<p>Co-ordinate meeting places with family members so you can find each other if telephones are down.</p>

</p>
<p>WINNIPEG -- The influenza outbreak has so far spared Canadian lives, but it is laying waste to the country's struggling pork industry, drawing comparisons to the crippling blow mad cow disease delivered to beef producers in 2003.</p>
<p>“We're heading for a wreck,” said Simon Goodwin, a pig farmer in Alberta, where a herd infected with the new influenza A H1N1 strain was recently quarantined.</p>
<p>“We've already seen $20 knocked off our price, and that was before we heard about it spreading to hogs in Alberta.”</p>
<p>The province quarantined 2,200 pigs on a central Alberta farm after Canadian Food Inspection Agency officials confirmed that a farm-worker infected the animals with influenza A H1N1.</p>
<p>The infected hogs are recovering from the sneezing and runny snouts that plagued them last week.</p>
<p>“It's passing over like a regular old flu in humans would,” said Gerald Hauer, Alberta's chief veterinarian.</p>
<p>But the economic carnage is only just beginning.</p>
<p>China banned all imports of Alberta pork yesterday, according to the Canadian Pork Council, and farmers speculate that their major export market, the United States, may follow suit this week. Both countries have expressed concern that the flu strain – originally termed swine flu by health officials because its genetic code shows porcine origins – will contaminate domestic herds.</p>
<p>As a result, hog prices will open at $1.22 a kilogram today, down 17 cents since trading closed last week.</p>
<p>Most hog operations break even only when prices hover above $1.30, a threshold historically breached every May as Canadians start putting pork chop to barbecue.</p>
<p>“If we miss this summer window, we're going to lose part of the industry,” said hog farmer John Preun, president of the Manitoba Pork Marketing Co-op. “The cull will be major.”</p>
<p>That gloomy forecast comes just as the Canadian industry – ranked third in world pork exports behind the U.S. and the European Union – was pulling out of a three-year tailspin precipitated by high energy prices and sustained by a combination of record-high feed costs and a low Canadian dollar.</p>
<p>“It's been the most difficult time our producers have ever gone through,” said Jurgen Preugschas, an Alberta hog farmer and president of the Canadian Pork Council. “Prices looked like they were going to strengthen at the end of April, and we would finally get back into profitable territory. And then this.”</p>
<p>Hanging over the entire hog industry is the grim spectre of mad-cow disease. A single Alberta calf was found to have the brain-wasting disease in 2003, prompting many countries to ban Canadian beef imports for a year. While the two bear little pathological resemblance – the flu quickly subsides in pigs and does not pose any food safety risk – their economic impact may be similar, according to some hog producers.</p>
<p>Only a strong campaign encouraging Canadians to eat more beef kept many ranchers afloat.</p>
<p>“They ate their way out of a problem,” said Mr. Preugschas. “And we may see a similar thing here. If Canadians could eat two extra meals of pork, that would certainly help our producer through these very difficult times.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>HOW DO PIGS GET FLU?</p>
<p>Pigs contract flu in the same way humans do. They are exposed to the virus in droplets of body fluid when someone nearby coughs or sneezes.</p>
<p>Swine influenza is common and spreads quickly because pigs live in close quarters and, unlike school children, they are not subject to constant admonitions to wash their hooves and cough into their sleeves.</p>
<p>What is unusual in the case of the Alberta farm is that the pigs contracted a human form of influenza.</p>
<p>Infectious disease experts say that human-to-pig transmission was expected because human swine influenza A H1N1 is genetically similar to swine influenza.</p>
<p>Influenza viruses do not normally cross the species barrier but they pose a constant challenge because of their ability to re-arrange.</p>
<p>They have segmented genes that allow viruses to swap genes and mutate constantly as a way of staying one step ahead of natural immunity.</p>
<p>Symptoms in pigs are similar to those in humans : fever, cough and runny nose and, in severe cases, grave respiratory problems and pneumonia. Pigs, like humans, may be vaccinated against seasonal influenza.Staff</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Official lies could lead to more flu deaths</b>
</div><div>Gwynne Dyer   </div>
<div>Independent</div>
<div>958 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>At the time of writing, almost a week after we all learned that a lethal new strain of influenza had appeared in Mexico, every single death attributed to swine flu has been Mexican, and all but one of those deaths happened in Mexico itself. (The one exception was a Mexican toddler visiting Texas with his family.)</p>
<p>The media work themselves into a frenzy about how this may be a pandemic that kills tens or hundreds of millions of people around the world. Even with a prescription, you can no longer buy Tamiflu or Relenza, the leading antivirals that could lessen the impact of swine flu: In most countries, governments requisitioned the entire available supply last weekend. And yet air travel between Mexico and the rest of the world continues mostly unhindered.</p>
<p>Our elders and betters assure us that a travel ban would not help.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization's assistant director-general, Keiji Fukuda, tells us that trying to contain the virus by enforcing travel restrictions "is not a feasible option." Besides, he says, "the virus has already spread to several other countries." Texas Governor Rick Perry says that closing the U.S. border with Mexico, crossed by tens of thousands each day, would be "a little premature."</p>
<p>Am I alone in experiencing a desire to strangle these people? To begin with, you either close the U.S. border now, or you don't bother.</p>
<p>Closing it a week from now would be completely pointless. If human-to-human transmission of the virus has not already taken root in the United States, it will certainly have done so once another few hundred thousand people have crossed the border.</p>
<p>Obviously, people from other countries who are currently holidaying in Mexico (overwhelmingly Americans and Canadians) must be allowed to come home, but would it be unreasonable to monitor their health for a week or so in case they are carrying the virus? Indeed, shouldn't we stop further holiday-makers from travelling to Mexico, and ask Mexicans to stay home for a while? It would cause inconvenience, yes, but large numbers of lives are at stake here.</p>
<p>It may be too late to stop the spread of the virus by banning non-emergency travel to and from Mexico, but nobody knows that for sure.</p>
<p>The virus has already appeared in a dozen other countries, but at this point almost all the victims are still people who were recently in Mexico.</p>
<p>If the flow of people from Mexico dwindled rapidly as the remaining tourists and business travellers came home, there would still be a chance of containing the virus.</p>
<p>If this "swine flu" really is like the "Spanish influenza" virus that killed tens of millions of healthy young adults in 1918-19, then we should be doing everything possible to hold it at bay. And even if the virus is bound to get out of Mexico in the end, it's worth winning some time before it does.</p>
<p>It is spring across the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's people live, and flu typically goes into retreat in the spring and summer. Even if it comes back in the northern autumn -- and pandemic flu often comes in several waves some months apart, becoming more virulent in the later waves -- by then we might have a vaccine ready. The process of designing and mass-producing the vaccine takes four to six months, which is exactly what immediate and severe restrictions on travel to Mexico now might win us.</p>
<p>So why do government bureaucrats everywhere, together with the international civil servants of the World Health Organization, assure us in massed chorus that travel bans are futile? Because they work for governments whose economies could be severely damaged by those bans.</p>
<p>Governments do accept a certain responsibility for protecting the lives of their citizens, but even in the developed world, where resources are not scarce, they interpret that responsibility quite differently.</p>
<p>Britain and France have stockpiled antiviral medicines such as Tamiflu for 50 per cent of their citizens (and Britain is now going to over 80 per cent). Japan, Australia and New Zealand are all over 40 per cent, but the United States only has 25 per cent cover and Canada a mere 17 per cent.</p>
<p>The biggest difference, however, is between the vague, general responsibility that governments feel for the lives of their citizens and the acute, real-time responsibility they feel for the health of their economies. They are inundated daily by demands from commercial and industrial organizations to keep the borders open and commerce flowing.</p>
<p>They are NOT inundated by demands by powerful citizen organizations to impose travel bans and save lives.</p>
<p>So they yield to the greater pressure, as governments generally do.</p>
<p>At the extreme, they conspire to hide the disease altogether, as China did with SARS (and Mexico may have done for some time with swine flu). And they lie routinely about the usefulness of stopping travel from infected countries, because to do so would gum up international commerce and damage economies.</p>
<p>The less-reflective ones may not even realize anymore that they are lying, because within WHO and the various national governments it has become an article of faith that you can't contain pandemics once they move beyond the first few villages. But that is quite obviously nonsense. Nonsense that could kill your kids.</p>

</p>
<p>Catching up is hard to do, especially with viruses naked to the eye. We have had no definite answers on whether a still-existing threat, avian flu, transmits from human to human, and whether the existing medication is still reliable when the virus mutates to who-knows-what. Now there is "swine flu", said to be a mixture of swine, human and avian flu viruses, which we are told is more feared to be contagious among humans.</p>
<p>Can we sit back and watch the news, since the outbreak is far away in Mexico, and since most of do not consume pork? Clearly, we can't, as experts are checking possible cases in nearby New Zealand -- and as we are not entirely sure whether authorities and public health services are ready.</p>
<p>We only have past experience to draw judgment; and in the wake of the bird flu scare we witnessed a rather worrying tug-of-war between those striving to protect public health, and those voicing business interests. Finally, it was decided that the only realistic prevention method was culling in areas identified to be vulnerable to bird flu. A nationwide cull like in Hong Kong was not feasible here; among the reasons given were that the government had no money to pay the millions of poultry owners.</p>
<p>We have also witnessed our impressive Minister of Health coming up with this and that conspiracy theory, which, regardless of the truth, did not do much to boost confidence in the government's readiness to face even a risk of a pandemic.</p>
<p>One must nevertheless have someone to trust in troubled times. At least President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono called a snap meeting on Monday, and passengers coming into the country will have to be extra patient as they are scanned for symptoms. Health agencies across the country are being urged to be on the alert for flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>In Mexico, most patients of swine flu are recovering, though experts are still trying to figure out the precise figure of "mild infections" in the country.</p>
<p>For the moment one can only hope the government does the best it can, and asks for all the help it needs. Demands to close down a laboratory belonging to the American military here was supposed to protect national interests, but when you're lying in bed helpless, you don't really care who's examining your tissue and fluid samples, as long as they quickly tell you what it is that is causing your suffering.</p>
<p>To let the people know it is doing the best it possibly can, the best PR is sharing what is known and what is not, the available public health services and the lack of them, and what is being done to improve them. If anything was learned from over 100 lives we have lost to bird flu, it is that overtly sensitive public officers, including those that reacted loudly to their areas being declared "red," did not help to instil confidence that they would be co-operative in the wake of another pandemic risk.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Family doctors across Canada are gearing up for a potential onslaught of patients with suspected H1N1 influenza. But if cases reach pandemic proportions, the physicians warn, they will not be able to bear the load on their own.</p>
<p>Dr. Val Rachlis, who works with two other family MDs in a Toronto practice, says they convened a meeting of staff last week after the World Health Organization and other public health bodies flagged the new swine flu as a potentially pandemic strain.</p>
<p>"And we basically brought out the (patient information) card that we had used during SARS ... and Purell and masks, so that anybody coming into the waiting room who's got a fever and cough immediately puts on a mask and lets the staff know," Rachlis said.</p>
<p>Any patient with these symptoms is whisked into an examination room and isolated from others in the waiting area.</p>
<p>Rachlis said this protocol was put into place after the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed 44 people in the Toronto area -- some of them health providers -- as part of the clinic's pandemic preparedness plan.</p>
<p>If patients with flu-like symptoms have not returned from Mexico or had contact with someone who'd recently been in the H1N1 flu epicentre, treatment would be the same as for seasonal flu, he said.</p>
<p>"If there's any contact, then we're doing the whole thing. We're putting on gowns and eye goggles and N95s (masks) as well."</p>
<p>Other provinces have discussed the possibility of designated centres to handle suspected flu cases to prevent primary-care physicians and hospital emergency departments from becoming overwhelmed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Worker infects Alberta pig farm; Herd has all but recovered, but WHO worries about pig-human mutation</b>
</div><div>Allison Jones and Helen Branswell   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>711 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.   </div>
</p>
<p>The discovery of the new swine flu in pigs on an Alberta farm raises a spectre that worries influenza experts: the possibility of the virus moving back and forth between humans and pigs, giving it more chances to mutate along the way.</p>
<p>About 220 pigs in a herd of 2,200 began showing signs of the flu April 24, Canadian officials revealed on the weekend.</p>
<p>Canada's swine flu caseload swelled yesterday to 101 after health officials in British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba, Quebec, Ontario and Nova Scotia reported new confirmed cases. Worldwide the WHO confirmed 787 cases in 17 countries.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico's health secretary declared the swine flu outbreak to be declining in his country, though health officials warned against complacency in combating the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>A farmhand who travelled to Mexico and fell ill upon his return is believed to have infected the Alberta pigs with the influenza virus.</p>
<p>While the development did not come as a surprise to the World Health Organization or other experts, they expressed concern.</p>
<p>"We expected that at some point since this virus has swine virus elements that we would find possibly the virus in swine pigs in the region where the virus is circulating," said Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO food safety scientist, yesterday.</p>
<p>Measures should be taken to prevent further human exposure to sick animals because of a risk people around the pigs could become infected, Embarek said.</p>
<p>"It has happened in the past with classical swine influenza," he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Ruben Donis, head of the molecular genetics branch of the influenza division at the United States Centers for Disease Control, said the movement of a virus from one species to another creates more opportunities for mutations.</p>
<p>While it isn't a given that any changes in the virus would mean it becomes more virulent -- causes more severe disease -- that cannot be ruled out, he said.</p>
<p>"It's possible," Donis said. "We have to consider all options."</p>
<p>Donis was especially concerned about the virus getting seeded in pig populations on small farms that don't have the same level of biosecurity as larger operations.</p>
<p>Another worker on the Alberta farm subsequently fell ill, but it's not yet known if that person caught the swine flu.</p>
<p>The herd in central Alberta has been quarantined, and all of the pigs are recovering or have recovered. The farm worker has also recovered.</p>
<p>There are no recommendations at this point from various agencies to cull pigs in Alberta or anywhere in the world, Embarek said.</p>
<p>He reassured the public that the virus is not a food-borne disease, saying there is no reason to be afraid of consuming pork products.</p>
<p>In Egypt, police and armoured cars charged into a crowd of 1,000 irate pig farmers armed with stones and bottles yesterday.</p>
<p>Twelve people were injured as residents of a Cairo slum resisted government efforts to kill the country's pigs.</p>
<p>Last week, Egypt ordered the slaughter of all the country's 300,000 pigs, even though no cases of swine flu have been reported there.</p>
<p>The WHO has said the move was unnecessary because the virus is being spread through humans.</p>
<p>Dr. Christopher Olsen, a swine flu expert at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said having this H1N1 influenza A virus go back into swine creates opportunities for it to pick up genetic mutations or swap genes with other flu viruses. The latter process is called reassortment.</p>
<p>"Putting it back into pigs creates more potential for genetic reassortment than in people alone," he said.</p>
<p>But even as the tally of people infected with swine flu continued to rise as of yesterday -- at least six other countries reported new cases -- Mexico's health secretary said the swine flu epidemic in his country "is now in its declining phase."</p>
<p>Jose Angel Cordova said data suggest the epidemic peaked between April 23 and April 28.</p>

<p>In 1854, Dr. John Snow plotted cholera cases on a map of London, England, to find the source of a serious outbreak that was killing hundreds of people. It became apparent that the biggest clusters of the disease were near a public water pump on Broad Street, and Dr. Snow was able to stop the spread by shutting down that source.</p>
<p>Fast-forward one-and-a-half centuries to Toronto, where a small firm is using 21st-century software to create maps with similar goals – the containment of disease – by showing infection patterns that can be understood at a glance.</p>
<p>Infonaut Inc. chief executive officer Niall Wallace and his partner, chief operating officer Matt McPherson, both former IT consultants for the Ontario government, created the company after helping to craft some of the recommendations that resulted from the SARS outbreak of 2003. They understood the value of visually represented, real-time infection data, and left government to set up Infonaut to develop that technology.</p>
<p>Infonaut has created three software products that turn infection information into maps. All are being tested in pilot projects and will soon be marketed commercially.</p>
<p>One, called Infection Watch Live, is now taking data gathered at 14 hospital emergency rooms in eastern Ontario and using it to create publicly accessible maps that show exactly where in the region cases of influenza and gastrointestinal diseases are active. Another, Hospital Watch Live, is being tested in Sault Ste. Marie. It uses radio sensors attached to a hospital's employees, patients and equipment to create a detailed record of all movements and interactions. This complex mapping can help monitor and stop the spread of C. difficile and other superbugs.</p>
<p>The third product, called Regional Watch Live, generates maps and reports for regional health professionals by merging lab test results with a range of other information.</p>
<p>With the H1N1 flu outbreak, these tools now seem particularly relevant. But that presents Infonaut with a dilemma: Can it benefit from growing awareness of the danger of infections without appearing to be exploiting the situation? “We've got all these communications and marketing activities that are just about to kick in,” Mr. Wallace said. “But we definitely don't want to seem untoward and [look like we're] taking advantage of it. It is a fine line.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>What the experts say</p>
<p>There's nothing wrong with Infonaut using the H1N1 flu outbreak to gain exposure, as long as the company is careful in the tone it takes, said John Lute, president of Toronto communications firm Lute and Co.</p>
<p>“You do have to be careful when you are stepping into an area that is causing pretty widespread concern,” Mr. Lute said. “You want to be very, very conscious of not appearing to be exploitive.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, it will clearly create an opportunity if Infonaut can increase its profile, “which helps it to get its story out, which helps it to get investors, which helps it to grow. All those things are good.”</p>
<p>Infonaut should ensure that its message is understated and that the company is not an “ambulance chaser,” Mr. Lute said. The fact that its potential clients are hospitals, institutions and professionals makes that job a lot easier. “They are in a much stronger position than somebody who, for example, starts having sales on face masks,” he said.</p>
<p>Mat Wilcox, who runs the Wilcox Group, a Vancouver-based public relations firm, agrees that Infonaut should move ahead with its marketing plans.</p>
<p>“I don't think these guys are taking unfair advantage of this situation, when it is in everyone's face,” Ms. Wilcox said after taking a recent flight from Toronto to Vancouver, where workers in both airports were wearing face masks, as were several people on the plane.</p>
<p>But the company does need to give straightforward information about how its products might help mitigate an outbreak in the future, and not exaggerate its promises, she said.</p>
<p>In particular, it needs to be upfront about the state of its pilot tests and include details of when full versions of its products will be available. It also must explain how much funding they will need to get there, Ms. Wilcox said.</p>
<p>“Many times I'll say to clients: ‘You're not there yet. You've got way too many holes to even go out there,' ” she said. “Everyone would like to get attention to their project … but sometimes they are not ready and don't have enough of a story to tell.”</p>
<p>Shane Dolgin, senior vice-president of public relations agency Edelman Canada, said the key test in this kind of situation is whether the product has a benefit to the public.</p>
<p>With Infonaut, there seems to be no question that there is a public gain, he said. “If it is just an opportunistic attempt to cash in on the misfortune of others, that tends to play badly. Where a company has something that can be tied to the public interest, such as in this case … it is very low-risk.”</p>
<p>He suggests that Infonaut make good use of its pilot test partners, such as the counties in eastern Ontario that are testing the Infection Watch Live system. “It is far more credible to have third parties who are using it – and can speak to the public benefit – deliver those messages,” Mr. Dolgin said.</p>
<p>He also said the company should forestall any concerns over privacy issues by spelling out how it ensures data on individuals are kept confidential.</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>In a nutshell</p>
<p>• There's nothing wrong with using the current concerns over H1N1 flu to gain exposure, as long as Infonaut is careful about taking a calm and respectful tone to its marketing and publicity.</p>
<p>• Make sure to present straightforward information about how the company's products might help mitigate an outbreak in the future, but do not exaggerate promises.</p>
<p>• Be upfront about the state of pilot tests, the timelines to get the software to market, and how much funding will be needed to go to full commercialization.</p>
<p>• Use respected third-party partners to endorse the products, a move that will give the company more credibility.</p>
<p>• If there are privacy concerns, spell them out and detail how they are being addressed.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexican stocks not immune to flu fallout</b>
</div><div>DAVID PARKINSON    </div>

<p>Mexico's stock market has so far managed to avoid infection from the H1N1 flu scare. But it may only be a matter of time before the effects of the epidemic knock the country's equity market on its back.</p>
<p>After slumping more than 3 per cent last Monday amid news of the escalating health threat in the country, Mexico's Bolsa stock index held its ground for the rest of the week. The Bolsa ended the week at 21,898.85, up 0.3 per cent since last Monday's selloff and still up an astounding 30 per cent over the past two months.</p>
<p>This despite deepening economic implications for Mexico from the viral outbreak, which has triggered massive cancellations of tourist travel and the virtual shutdown of Mexico City, the country's capital and economic epicentre.</p>
<p>The national government ordered a five-day shutdown of non-essential government offices and businesses and urged its citizens to stay home as it wrestles to bring the flu outbreak under control. The stock market was closed Friday anyway for the May Day national holiday, but plans to operate as normal this week. “We've had nothing in the way of a wrench thrown into the Mexican market,” said Geoffrey Dennis, Latin American equity strategist at <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span>. “We've not yet seen the swine flu slow down the strong rally we've had since mid-March.”</p>
<p>Analysts said that while Mexican stocks have rallied along with world equity markets in general in that time, there have been a few Mexican-specific factors that have lent support to the stock surge. They said that because of Mexico's particularly close export ties to the U.S., the improving tone of U.S. economic indicators in recent weeks has renewed investor optimism in Mexico's prospects for a turnaround.</p>
<p>The recent passage of a new agreement with 17 of Mexico's biggest pension funds, committing them to investing all new pension contributions from workers into domestic assets, including stocks, has also given the Mexican stock market a shot in the arm. Mr. Dennis recently estimated that this will direct about $4.7-billion (U.S.) of funds into Mexican assets for the remainder of this year; previously, up to 20 per cent of this total could have been invested outside Mexico.</p>
<p>But the biggest boost for the Mexican market came two weeks ago, when the International Monetary Fund approved a $47-billion line of credit for the country. Analysts said the credit line backstops Mexican assets and has removed the most serious risks overhanging the country's currency and debt. “That really bolstered sentiment around Mexico,” said Nick Chamie, head of emerging-markets research at <span class="companylink">RBC Dominion Securities</span>.</p>
<p>Yet analysts warned that the H1N1 flu outbreak is certain to deal a heavy blow to a Mexican economy that is already foundering badly. Mexico's central bank this week said its gross domestic product could shrink by as much as 4.8 per cent in 2009, prompting Citibank to cut its own Mexican GDP forecast to a drop of 4.9 per cent (from 3.5 per cent previously) – and that was before taking into account the impact of the influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>Economists have predicted the flu crisis could shave a further 0.5 to one percentage point off Mexico's GDP. Even if the outbreak is brought under control quickly, it threatens to have a lingering effect on tourism, which accounts for almost 10 per cent of the economy.</p>
<p>And an even more severe slump in Mexican economic activity could weigh particularly heavily on its stock market because of the make-up of the market itself. Despite the fact that the Mexican economy relies heavily on exports, its stock market is heavily tilted toward domestic, retail-oriented stocks that rely on consumer demand at home. Almost two-thirds of the Bolsa is made up of consumer and domestic telecommunications-services stocks. “[The Mexican stock market] looks very overbought, especially in light of a very bad economic outlook,” Mr. Dennis said. “We're advising our clients to take profits.”</p>

<p>Whoa! Hold on a minute. Informed debate over farming practices is something we view as healthy, but the views expressed by Cerridwen Black in the letter Source of the disease (April 29) is the kind of inflammatory talk akin to shouting "fire" in a theatre.</p>
<p>Black may find it "incredible" that the news media have not dug a little deeper to link the latest flu outbreak to intensive livestock operations, but perhaps that's because there is no evidence.</p>
<p>While this particular influenza virus has a connection to pigs at some point in its development, it also has human and avian (bird) genes in it. Making a blanket assumption that this flu is somehow connected to intensive livestock operations takes an "incredible" leap in logic.</p>
<p>Indoor hog barns are much less conducive to the spread of disease than older style outdoor pens where pigs interact with birds, other animals and humans. Modern pig producers are extremely concerned about biosecurity. For example, they shower in and change into barn clothes before entering, then shower out when leaving.</p>
<p>Animals and humans do occasionally transfer diseases back and forth -- this has occurred for thousands of years and will continue to happen as diseases evolve.</p>
<p>We applaud the Free Press editorial Pandemic irrationality (April 30). Despite the scientific evidence, many officials the world over chose to call this virus "swine flu," thereby tainting an entire species and industry. Many regular folks have decided to accept without question that pigs must be to blame. Much of what we hear and see in broadcasts are merely suspicions and offhand comments about living near pigs, such as the one made in the article entitled Virus likely in Manitoba: expert by a father who suspects that his young sons have contracted swine flu, at least partly because they were "near pigs."</p>

</div><div>By Mary Agnes Welch   </div>

</p>
<p>A Brandon girl is the first Manitoban to fall ill with H1N1 flu, but provincial health officials say there's no need to close her school.</p>
<p>The girl, who attends Riverheights School -- a kindergarten to Grade 8 school -- is recovering from only a mild case of swine flue and didn't require hospitalization. She travelled to Mexico, the southern United States and Vancouver in mid to late April.</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, Manitoba's chief provincial public health officer, said Sunday there is no need to close her school or quarantine her family.</p>
<p>He said the turmoil caused by interrupting the education of more than 300 students and forcing parents to miss work would be overkill since only mild cases of the illness have been reported in Canada so far. And, closing the school wouldn't be very effective since kids still interact at parties, play dates and sporting events. The smarter approach is to continue asking sick kids to stay home, said Kettner.</p>
<p>"We are strongly recommending that the school remain open," he said. "The students who feel well should attend school as per usual."</p>
<p>Public health officials will be visiting Riverheights School today to answer questions and offer information to parents, staff and students. And health experts are tracking and monitoring all the people the child came into direct contact with since her return to make sure no one else gets sick. Direct contact generally means someone who was within sneezing distance -- one or two metres. That includes family members and classmates.</p>
<p>Kettner said it's likely that the girl's family and friends will get sick, but since the swine flu has so far been no worse than garden variety winter viruses, the risk posed by the girl is minimal.</p>
<p>Principals from each of the 22 schools in the Brandon School Division (BSD) will meet today to discuss the division's emergency response protocol, division superintendent Donna Michaels said Sunday.</p>
<p>"Given that this is a potentially highly contagious issue, we follow (the emergency response protocol) to a T," Michaels said. "We want parents to know their schools are safe. We wouldn't take a chance with children's lives."</p>
<p>School closure decisions are typically made by the education minister, in consultation with Manitoba Health, but under provincial legislation Kettner can order schools closed.</p>
<p>A letter from Manitoba Health will also be sent home with every student, and staff and students will be reminded to wash their hands, cough into their sleeve and stay at home if they're not feeling well, Michaels said.</p>
<p>"We're reinforcing the message from public health. We're very alert to the situation and that's an important part of our job... and that we're certain we've done everything we possibly can do," she said.</p>
<p>As of Friday afternoon, about 18 people had been tested for swine flu in Manitoba, with just one positive case.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Manitoba's top veterinarian says Manitoba's pork products are safe despite reports that more than 200 pigs on a central Alberta hog farm were found infected with human swine flu on the weekend.</p>
<p>Dr. Wayne Lees, the province's chief veterinary officer, said Sunday a host of biosecurity measures are in place, including mandatory showers that hog barn workers must take before and after they enter the barns and special clothing they wear while in the barns. And pigs undergo health inspections before and after they are slaughtered, and the province is testing swine for flu on an ongoing basis. No cases of the H1N1 strain have been found in Manitoba's hogs.</p>
<p>"This is not a food safety issue," said Lees. "There is no indication that influenza is transmitted through properly prepared pork products."</p>

<p>Case count</p>
<p>Mexico: 19 deaths; 506 confirmed cases or one sick person per 217,000 people.</p>
<p>United States: One death; 226 cases or one sick person per 1.3 million people.</p>
<p>Canada: No deaths; 101 cases or one sick person per 328,000 people.</p>
<p>Manitoba: No deaths; one case or one sick person per 1.2 million people.</p>
<p>Food safety</p>
<p>Pork is perfectly safe to eat, the World Health Organization and Canadian pork producers insisted Sunday after Canadian officials confirmed that pigs at an Alberta farm were infected with the H1N1 influenza A virus.</p>
<p>"You don't get this disease through eating pork, and therefore there is no reason to be afraid of eating pork or pork products," Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO senior scientist on food safety, said from Geneva.</p>
<p>"As long as pork is cooked the way we normally cook meat, there is no problem and no risk at all to get this disease."</p>
<p>School, daycare</p>
<p>Guidelines for schools, daycare centres and for those caring for the sick at home about how to handle situations involving the virus were released Sunday by the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>Given the illness's mild nature so far, the interim guidelines -- found on the agency's website -- do not call for closures of institutions. The recommendation stands even if a confirmed case of the H1N1 flu virus is identified.</p>
<p>"Right now, we don't consider school closures to be necessary," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said in a release.</p>
<p>"What is important is for schools and daycares to be promoting good infection prevention measures -- like simple handwashing."</p>

<p>LOS ANGELES -- You can't keep a good X-Man down.</p>
<p>Hugh Jackman's prequel X-Men Origins: Wolverine leaped to the top of the box office with an $87-million opening weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday.</p>
<p>That put the movie right in the pack with the three previous X-Men movies in which Jackman played mutant superhero Wolverine.</p>
<p>The trilogy's final chapter, X-Men: The Last Stand, had the franchise's best opening with $102.8 million. But Wolverine came in ahead of the first two movies; "X-Men" did $54.5 million in its first weekend and "X2: X-Men United" took in $85.6 million.</p>
<p>"It's all systems go," said Chris Aronson, distribution executive for 20th Century Fox, which releases the X-Men movies. "Audiences have a huge appetite for Hugh and this character."</p>
<p>Wolverine also pulled in $73 million in 101 overseas markets, giving it a worldwide total of $160 million. The movie's debut in Mexico was delayed for two weeks because of the swine flu outbreak there.</p>
<p>The Warner Bros. romantic comedy Ghosts of Girlfriends Past, starring Matthew McConaughey and Jennifer Garner, debuted in second place with $15.3 million.</p>
<p>The previous weekend's top movie, <span class="companylink">Sony</span><span class="companylink">Screen Gems</span>' Obsessed, fell to No. 3 with $12.2 million. The thriller starring Beyoncé Knowles raised its 10-day total to $47 million.</p>
<p>Overall revenues were virtually even with the same weekend a year ago, when Iron Man surprised Hollywood with a bigger-than-expected $98.6 million debut.</p>
<p>According to Hollywood.com, 2009 revenues are at $3.25 billion, up 16.4 per cent from last year's. Accounting for higher ticket prices, movie attendance is running 13.7 per cent ahead of 2008's pace.</p>
<p>In limited release, Jim Jarmusch's moody crime drama The Limits of Control opened solidly with $54,233 in three theatres, averaging $18,078 a cinema, compared with $21,225 in 4,099 locations for Wolverine. The Focus Features film about a mystery man on a murky assignment features Isaach De Bankole, Bill Murray and Tilda Swinton.</p>
<p>It was not all good news for the weekend's new movies. Roadside Attractions' animated sci-fi adventure Battle for Terra flopped with $1.1 million, averaging just $916 in 1,162 theatres.</p>
<p>Wolverine does not have much breathing room at the box office. This Friday brings Paramount's relaunch of Star Trek, with a new cast playing James Kirk, Spock and other characters from the 1960s TV series.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Germ FACTORY Workplaces are breeding grounds for germs -- here's how to avoid them -</b>
</div><div>Healthy Living / Shamona Harnett   </div>
<div>1064 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>B6</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Germ FACTORY</p>
<p>Workplaces are breeding grounds for germs -- here's how to avoid them</p>
<p>Co-workers teased retired nurse, Mary Smyth, about her cleanliness.</p>
<p>They had embarrassing nicknames for the Winnipegger, who was known in the hospitals she worked for washing her hands constantly, even before and after she gave a patient a glass of water.</p>
<p>"Their water glass was at their bedside. Who's touched their water glass and how clean are the patient's hands?" says Smyth, not her real name.</p>
<p>Smyth, who asked not to be identified, says she cringed at the number of healthcare staff who didn't wash their hands between patients. As somewhat of a germ-a-phobe, she was well aware of the microbes that lurked in her workplace -- germs that could make patients, staff and visitors sick.</p>
<p>"Oh my goodness -- hands are the dirtiest things," she says. "And nurses and doctors are the dirtiest people for not washing their hands."</p>
<p>Retired for the last few years, Smyth still believes in the power of cleanliness in preventing illness.</p>
<p>"I have a hand sanitizer in every single purse and in my pocket if I'm not carrying a purse," she says. "My hands are clean ongoing."</p>
<p>While you likely take precautions against germs in places like the bathroom, chances are you do not take the same measures in your work environment.</p>
<p>But whether you work in a hospital or in a conventional office setting, viruses, bacteria and fungi lurk everywhere -- on your desk, on the fax machine and at the water cooler.</p>
<p>A 2002 University of Arizona study found that a typical desk can support up to 10 million bacteria -- 400 times as many microbes as most toilet seats.</p>
<p>"Certainly there is no doubt that the office is harbouring a variety of viruses, a variety of bacteria and fungi which in a specific type of patient population can cause an infection, for sure," says George Zhanel, a medical microbiologist at the University of Manitoba, who urges sick people who are sneezing, coughing or feverish to stay home from work until well.</p>
<p>He says that people can catch everything from swine flu to staphylococcal infections--serious bacterial skin infections-- from the office.</p>
<p>He says germs are transmitted when one person sneezes or coughs on an object, another person touches that object and then touches someone else. Eventually germs enter the body through the nose, eyes or mouth.</p>
<p>Various bacteria can also enter cuts, scrapes, burns and even eczema-riddled skin.</p>
<p>The best way to prevent the spread of diseases? Washing hands well with soap and water and using hand sanitizer when soap and water are not available, says Zhanel, noting that dirty hands are what transmit most infectious diseases from one person to another -- either directly or via an object, such as a fax machine.</p>
<p>Zhanel says that not enough people take the time to wash up -- not even the experts.</p>
<p>He notes an observational study at a meeting of microbiologists about a decade ago. The study found 30 per cent of the male germ experts attending the meeting did not wash their hands after using the bathroom.</p>
<p>"And these are bug people, microbiologists, people from around the world who know about infectious diseases and should know a lot better," says Zhanel, a reseacher with the Canadian Antimicrobial Resistance Alliance. "So they're not doing it. What would make us think that individuals who don't have as much training and perhaps do not know all the consequences are doing it?"</p>
<p>Worried about computer viruses at work? It's time to worry about the other kinds of viruses, bacteria and fungi lingering at the office that could make you sick.</p>
<p>Here are some germ-laden hotspots in the workplace:</p>
<p>Communal coffee pot: You grab a cup of java for a jolt of caffeine. However, the number of microbes on the coffee handle will probably be enough to give you a wake-up call, says Zhanel, noting that touching the coffee pot without washing your hands immediately after could give you a cold, a flu or worse.</p>
<p>Pens and pencils: Do you know where that pen or pencil that you grabbed off a co-worker's desk has been? Perhaps in a mouth or in a pair of dirty hands that's teeming with staph or E.coli.</p>
<p>Desks and computer keyboards: Many a sticky finger has touched the keyboard and mouse on your desk. You'd be wise to wash your hands after using, says Zhanel. As well, try to wipe your desk and keyboard with rubbing alcohol swabs stashed in your desk.</p>
<p>Water cooler: It's the gathering place to exchange niceties and gossip, but you could also be exchanging germs there, too. Zhanel says they lurk on the little paper water cups and on the lever you pull to get your water. They also likely reside on the spout-- where careless people may have touched to the opening of their sipped-from water bottles.</p>
<p>Floor: Most people realize that floors are dirty. But did you think to wash your hands after getting on the floor to pick up a pen or to move a piece of office furniture? Zhanel says a plethora of germs tracked in from shoe soles could make you very sick.</p>
<p>Kitchenette: The microwave handle and dishrags that coworkers have left soaked in water are likely to be crawling with germs, says Zhanel.</p>
<p>Phones: Dirty hands and droplets of saliva are likely all over your phone. Take time to clean it regularly and wash your hands after using it, say experts.</p>
<p>Fridge: Inside the fridge isn't so bad, says Zhanel. "Very few organisms grow well at about 4 C which is what most fridges are." The outside of the fridge, particularly the handle, is a different story, he says, noting that people constantly open and close the fridge potentially leaving it covered the cold and flu viruses and any variety of bacteria or fungi.</p>
<p>Fax Machine, printer: Just like everything else in the office that is used by many people, the buttons on the these machines have seen countless hands and countless microbes.</p>

<p>BEIJING -- There are 12 metres that Kevin Ireland knows all too well. It's the length of his hallway on the 11th floor in the Metropark hotel in downtown Hong Kong, the building where he and some 305 others have been quarantined since another guest there was diagnosed with the H1N1 virus on Friday.</p>
<p>“It's boring, it's dull. The windows on the non-smoking floors don't open, so there's no fresh air. That's getting to us,” the 45-year-old Indian national said of life in four-star quarantine. Mr. Ireland, a clothing merchant, was supposed to be on a flight back to his native New Delhi today, but he and the other guests have been told that they won't be allowed to leave the hotel until at least Friday for fear they came into contact with a Mexican man who briefly checked into the Metropark last week before being diagnosed with the virus formerly known as swine flu.</p>
<p>It's big excitement at the Metropark when someone gets a phone call from the outside world. Or when guests are allowed to get pizza delivered – carefully handed across the quarantine line to police officers in protective suits – like they did yesterday.</p>
<p>At least the guests at the Metropark know why they have been quarantined. Though the Hong Kong case remains the only confirmed instance of H1N1 in China, hundreds of people around the country were kept in quarantine over the weekend due to H1N1-flu fears, including dozens of Mexican citizens who were apparently deemed suspicious solely because of their passports.</p>
<p>Most of those under quarantine were either guests at the Metropark, or airline passengers who had shared one of two flights the 25-year-old flu victim took before he was diagnosed. Despite the dragnet, a China-wide hunt was under way yesterday for dozens of people who were suspected of having come into contact with the flu patient.</p>
<p>More controversially, the Mexican embassy in Beijing said more than 50 Mexican business people and tourists had been involuntarily quarantined despite showing no flu symptoms at all. According to media reports, some were removed from their hotel rooms and escorted to hospitals in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>Among those detained was Mexico's consul-general in Guangzhou, who was briefly held for medical checks upon returning to the country from a vacation in Cambodia.</p>
<p>Flights between Mexico City and Shanghai – the route the 25-year-old flu victim flew before transferring onwards to Hong Kong – were suspended indefinitely. The measures set off a diplomatic row between Beijing and Mexico, which warned its citizens to avoid travel to China for the near future.</p>
<p>“Mexican citizens showing no signs at all of being ill have been isolated under unacceptable conditions,” Mexican Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa said yesterday. “These are discriminatory measures, without foundation.”</p>
<p>According to media reports, at least one Canadian – a 38-year-old Quebec City native – was among those quarantined in Hong Kong. Foreigners from Canada and the United States landing yesterday at Chinese airports were also taken aside for on-the-spot temperature tests, though they appear to have been treated less harshly than Mexican passport holders.</p>
<p>Chinese officials yesterday defended the somewhat draconian measures as both necessary and legal. “All the measures are taken in accordance with laws and regulations,” said Chen Qiwei, a spokesman for the Shanghai city government. Scarred by accusations it was too slow to react during the 2003 SARS epidemic, Beijing has made a point of being seen as responding swiftly to any potential H1N1 cases.</p>
<p>Inside the Metropark hotel, many feel badly treated, and those inside say tempers have boiled over on more than one occasion since the lockdown began. But Mr. Ireland, for one, says he sympathizes with the steps the government has taken, even if he's among those caught on the wrong side of the line.</p>
<p>“The government would prefer to inconvenience 200 or 300 people than risk infecting the whole population. It is highly inconvenient for us, but I think if I was on the other side of the fence, I'd do the same.”</p>

</div><div>ANDRÉ PICARD   </div>

<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>News that pigs contracted swine influenza A H1N1 virus from a human on a central Alberta farm should not alarm consumers of pork because the virus is not food-borne, food safety experts say.</p>
<p>But the unusual development creates a whole new series of challenges for public-health officials trying to limit the spread of the new form of flu in humans and swine alike.</p>
<p>“It happened once, it could happen again elsewhere,” said Peter Ben Embarek, a food-safety scientist at the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>As the virus jumps from pigs to humans and back again it risks mutating and becoming more dangerous to both species. And there is an added concern now that swine flu has been reported in parts of Asia where avian influenza is already present, and the pandemic strains could mix into a lethal cocktail.</p>
<p>“That is, of course, a concern and this is why it is necessary to monitor the situation closely,” Dr. Embarek said.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the WHO reported that there have been 937 confirmed cases of H1N1 flu in 18 countries.</p>
<p>Canada, for its part, has tallied 101 cases in seven provinces. Nova Scotia is hardest hit with 33 cases, most of them at King's Edgehill school in the town of Windsor. Manitoba became the latest province hit by H1N1, also in a school-age child.</p>
<p>Officials in a number of countries warned that they expect a sharp increase in numbers in the coming days as laboratories catch up on the backlog of tests.</p>
<p>“I do expect more cases, more severe cases and more deaths,” Anne Schuchat, interim deputy director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said yesterday.</p>
<p>She noted that a clearer picture of who is at risk is beginning to emerge – and it is young adults who seem most vulnerable. About half the cases of H1N1 flu have been reported in people under 17, and half those over 17. That is markedly different from seasonal flu, which tends to hit young children and the elderly.</p>
<p>It is widely anticipated that, in coming days, the WHO will move the pandemic flu alert to phase 6, meaning the world is at risk of a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>“At the present time, I would still propose that a pandemic is imminent,” said Michael Ryan, director of the global alert and response team at WHO.</p>
<p>“At this point, we have to think stage 6 will be reached; we have to hope that it will not be reached.”</p>
<p>Others sounded more optimistic notes.</p>
<p>Mexico's Health Secretary, José Angel Cordova, said the worst was over and the H1N1 flu epidemic “is now in its declining phase.”</p>
<p>Canadian officials, for their part, were scrambling to deal with news of the virus hitting a pig farm in a country that exports $2.7-billion worth of pork products annually. While the immediate health risk posed by infected pigs is negligible, the optics are bad.</p>
<p>Brian Evans, chief veterinary officer at the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, said an investigation showed that a farm worker returned from Mexico on April 12 and had contact with pigs on the farm two days later. On April 24, pigs began showing signs of influenza; about 220 of the 2,200 pigs on the farm were found to be infected with H1N1. The farm, which CFIA refused to identify, was quarantined on April 28 and remains so even though the worker and all the pigs have recovered from the flu.</p>
<p>Three measures can be used to control outbreaks of disease in animals: Culling, vaccination and increased bio-security measures.</p>
<p>Dr. Evans said no cull was planned and no vaccine is yet available for the new strain of flu. The CFIA called on all veterinarians and pork producers to “increase their bio-security measures to limit any risks to animal health.”</p>
<p>There is no risk of contracting influenza from pork products. Flu viruses are fragile: They can survive only hours outside a live body – human or animal – and are easily destroyed in meat by cooking.</p>
<p>Dr. Schuchat of the CDC said that, in coming weeks, public-health officials are going to have to make some tough, unpopular decisions, such as deciding whether to close schools when there is an infected child, and deciding whether to proceed with large public gatherings like graduation ceremonies.</p>
<p>“At this time, cancelling public gatherings doesn't make sense,” she said.</p>
<p>One of the latest cases of H1N1 flu in Canada was detected at Collège Charlemagne, a private school in Montreal's west end. The school has no plans to close, even though the student, who contracted the illness on a visit to Mexico, seems to have attended school while ill with the flu.</p>
<p>David Butler-Jones, the Chief Public Health Officer of Canada, approved of that approach.</p>
<p>“Right now, we don't consider school closures to be necessary,” he said.</p>

<p>If the spectre of swine flu has made you anxious, consider the big picture, says Martin Antony, president-elect of the Canadian Psychological Association.</p>
<p>"Put it in a broader perspective," the psychology professor at Toronto's Ryerson University says. Every year 700 to 2,500 Canadians die of influenza, according to Health Canada estimates, but an estimated 45,000 die from smoking-related diseases.</p>
<p>A huge percentage of Canada's 33 million-plus population have colds at any one time, he continues. It is a thousand times more likely that a cough is just a cough than swine flu, according to Antony.</p>
<p>To ease swine-flu anxiety, make the distinction between the public health risk and personal risk.</p>
<p>"The statistical risk is very, very low that one of us will get it," Antony says.</p>
<p>Unless health officials deem otherwise, don't feed your swine-flu anxiety by avoiding socializing and public places. Relaxation therapy, meditation and physical exercise all help to reduce anxiety, he says.</p>
<p>Antony has spent the past 20 years studying anxiety. He is the author of more than 20 books on the topic. The most recent is The Anti-Anxiety Workbook, co-authored with the University of Houston's Peter Norton. Antony is the director of research at St. Joseph's Healthcare's Anxiety and Treatment Centre in Hamilton.</p>
<p>Anxiety is an emotion based on a response to some future event such as an exam, Antony says. Fear, however, is a response to an immediate threat such as a charging bear.</p>
<p>All of us have anxieties, he says. An estimated six million Canadians have clinically significant anxiety disorders, according to Antony, citing recent Statistics Canada surveys and U.S research.</p>
<p>While there is more evidence of anxieties now, that doesn't necessarily mean there is a jump in the numbers, Antony says. "It's hard to know whether there's an increase or whether people are more aware."</p>
<p>Anxieties can negatively affect employment, education, relationships and social interactions, he says. He has had a patient who feared contagions so much that she insisted family members immediately change their clothes on coming into the house. Others are afraid to cook for their families, fearing they are contagious.</p>
<p>Anxieties are highly treatable using cognitive therapy, according to Antony. Cognitive therapy involves changing people's beliefs from the negative and unrealistic to the realistic, he says. "It's all about questioning [your] thoughts."</p>
<p>If, for example, you're anxious because not everyone likes you, Antony would point out how impossible it is to be universally liked. Even Mother Teresa wasn't liked by all, he says. If your anxiety centres on one person, ask "what does it matter if he/she doesn't like me?"</p>
<p>In the case of a 23-year-old obsessed with dying of a heart attack, the psychologist discussed the probabilities of healthy 20-somethings dying that way. Fear of flying is a common anxiety. The best way to get over it is to climb on airplanes until the anxiety disappears, Antony says.</p>
<p>Antony admits to some old anxieties himself. The prospect of public speaking made him anxious, but he overcame it through exposure, as his job requires frequent public presentations. He wasn't comfortable with snakes but knew he had to treat those with a snake phobia. Ahead of the sessions, he spent time handling the snake on his own before exposing it to the patient.</p>
<p>"Generally what we want to do is keep things in perspective and do the things that make us anxious," he says.</p>

<p>Sixteen years ago, football players from archrivals Phillipsburg (N.J.) High School and Easton (Pa.) High School walked off the field, deeply unsatisfied at the final numbers on the scoreboard: 7-7.</p>
<p>More than a decade-and-a-half later, those same players met at Lafayette</p>
<p>College's Fisher Stadium on Sunday as part of a promotion for Gatorade to settle the score.</p>
<p>The players, now in their early 30s, finally produced a winner as Phillipsburg defeated Easton, 27-12.</p>
<p>Most impressive was the attendance: 13,350. That's either an awful lot of alumni or a lot of people interested in the first of a series of games called Rivalry Replay.</p>
<p>Bruce Lebitz, co-captain of the 1993 Phillipsburg team, said the replay may have saved his life. Since high school, Lebitz's weight ballooned to more than 300, but when the rematch was announced, he went on a fitness regimen that saw him lose 57 pounds in eight weeks.</p>
<p>"You never know when you're going to get a second chance in life," Lebitz told the New Jersey Star-Ledger. "This is more than a game. This has been a life-changing event for all of us."</p>

<p>With nothing more than his bare hands, trash collector Felipe Reyes sifts through household waste in the back of a garbage truck, including kitchen scraps and soiled toilet paper, six days a week. He searches for valuables and recyclables, such as cans and bottles, that can be resold. And he hardly ever falls ill, Reyes boasts. But he recently started wearing a mask to avoid catching swine flu, which he considers far more dangerous than anything lurking in the tons of trash his truck hauls off to an overflowing landfill run by the mafia.</p>
<p>"We have more defences against what's in here than the flu," he said after removing his mask to puff on a Marlboro cigarette.</p>
<p>"The flu," he added, "rather scares me."</p>
<p>Reyes is hardly the only one taking extra precautions in this city of more than 20 million inhabitants, where the flu outbreak has forced authorities to cancel classes, limit restaurants to offering just takeout service, and urge all non-essential businesses to stay closed until May 6. Authorities also called on residents to stay home and forgo decamping the city for traditional Labour Day (or May Day) weekend getaways to Acapulco.</p>
<p>Residents have largely complied, although some in the Mexican capital have taken advantage of the tranquillity and unusually clear skies to ride bicycles, rollerblade, and jog down streets normally clogged by inattentive drivers.</p>
<p>Many prominent institutions and organizations have also complied with orders to avoid convening large public gatherings. Some unions called off their May 1 marches, political parties suspended campaign inaugurations for the summer midterm elections, and the Archdiocese of Mexico City cancelled Sunday Mass across the region. Even cabbies in their ubiquitous <span class="companylink">Volkswagen</span> taxis were seen wearing masks and latex gloves.</p>
<p>The high rate of compliance with the suggestions from government officials failed to surprise pollster Dan Lund of the Mund Group in Mexico City, who studies Mexican social values.</p>
<p>"This isn't people obeying the government. It's that they're afraid, and what's being suggested to them makes sense," he said.</p>
<p>Still, some signs of normalcy were visible. The subway is operating on schedule, grocery and department stores are brimming with merchandise -- except for some shortages of masks and hand sanitizer -- and garbage is being collected, even on Sundays.</p>
<p>The usual stream of bad news so prevalent before the outbreak also has kept flowing. Prisoners rioted in a Mexico City holding facility, supposedly over a disputed soccer game, punks clashed with cops in the annual May 1 demonstrations, and renegade sections of the teachers' union protested pension changes and an education reform package that would strip them of the right to sell or bequeath their jobs upon retiring.</p>
<p>But disasters are nothing new for Mexico City, which has been flooded, hit by pandemics, and rocked by earthquakes since its founding in 1325 on a series of lakes in a high-altitude valley.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doctors learning from SARS</b>
</div><div>Daniel Kalla   </div>
<div>Special to The Leader-Post</div>

</p>
<p>In my capacity as an ER physician, I recently came face-to-face, or more accurately mask-to-mask, with my first case of swine flu. My patient was admirably calm, but I still saw a glint of something in her eyes -- fear of the unknown. The whole scenario was painfully reminiscent of our last big infectious threat. Remember SARS?</p>
<p>In spring 2003, I attended the first city-wide SARS task force meeting. The virus had been named only days before and we knew very little about it, except it was breaking all the usual rules and killing health-care workers in Asia. My reaction at the time could be summarized as: "We are all going to die!"</p>
<p>I remember when Dr. Patty Daly, Vancouver's chief medical health officer, calmly reassured everyone at the meeting that we were not facing Armageddon.</p>
<p>She explained that SARS did not possess the contagiousness or natural reservoirs (i.e. host animals aside from humans) to sustain itself. She preached a measured response.</p>
<p>I left the meeting still convinced we were all doomed, but time proved her right. Aside from the tragic situation in Toronto and a few other limited clusters, on a worldwide scale SARS turned out to be a tempest in a teapot. But it served an important purpose as a global dress rehearsal to help prepare us for the next pandemic influenza.</p>
<p>Now we are facing the swine flu, or H1N1 influenza, and the World Health Organization has raised its level of alarm to five out of six in terms of the threat of the virus evolving into the next pandemic.</p>
<p>In my novel, Pandemic, I envisioned how the world would react to a new threat. I imagined and characterized a worst-case scenario with rampant deaths, widespread panic and governmental collapse.</p>
<p>But the reality is pandemics come and pandemics go, and no two are the same. History has taught us we can expect a new strain of influenza to evolve every 30 or 40 years so different from previous viruses that it causes "antigenic shift" -- in other words, the virus looks so unfamiliar to our immune systems that we have no natural immunity.</p>
<p>The reason we do not all get sick every flu season is that, to our immune systems, this year's flu virus looks enough like previous ones to give us partial immunity. Only a small percentage of people exposed to the annual flu virus, roughly 10 to 15 per cent, develop symptoms. This is not true of a pandemic, where the virus's infectivity is much higher.</p>
<p>The burning question is not whether the swine flu will become a pandemic, but rather how many will develop severe illness or die. That is how pandemics leave their mark.</p>
<p>So far, in Canada no one has become critically ill from swine flu. The deaths have been primarily limited to Mexico, where most of the victims, disturbingly, have been young and healthy, but the overall fatality rate appears to have plateaued. While it is true influenza viruses behave unpredictably, there is no evidence yet the swine flu is going to be anywhere near as devastating as the Spanish flu was.</p>
<p>Kalla is an emergency room physician in Vancouver who confronted a case of SARS in 2003 and sat on the regional SARS Response Taskforce. The experience prompted him to write the novel 'Pandemic'.</p>

<p>It's good to see that, so far, most Metro Vancouver residents seem to be keeping their cool about the so-called swine flu. The same, unfortunately, cannot be said about some of their attitudes toward global warming.</p>
<p>Indeed, Vancouver's Rebecca Dunsmuir appears so fired up about my daring to question the hysteria surrounding alleged, human-induced climate change that she wants me sent to Australia to see first-hand the devastation climate change has caused.</p>
<p>"People are dying, starving and losing their life's work on their farms," she wrote in a letter to the editor. "The continent may soon be uninhabitable." Soon be uninhabitable? I thought it was already. No, seriously, Dunsmuir's comments illustrate one of modern life's main problems.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that we're generally safer, healthier and more comfortable than ever -- or because of it -- we've become suckers for scary stories about everything from expanding deserts to increasing droughts to melting ice that could drastically raise world sea levels.</p>
<p>Look no further than the recent, scary-sounding story from Reuters news agency about the breaking up of a West Antarctica ice shelf "almost the size of New York City" -- blamed, of course, on global warming from burning fossil fuels.</p>
<p>However, as a much less sensational report in The Australian newspaper makes clear, sea-ice losses in West Antarctica over the past 30 years have been more than offset in just one sector of East Antarctica, which itself is four times the size of West Antarctica and is mostly cooling.</p>
<p>This trend is confirmed by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which points out that Antarctic sea ice this March was at its fourth- greatest level since 1979 and had increased at an average rate of 4.7 per cent per decade.</p>
<p>The NOAA report also noted that the average temperature for March for the world's combined land and ocean surface was only the 10th-warmest since records began in 1880.</p>
<p>And that's not really scary at all, especially considering we're talking about less-than-perfect instrument systems and tiny temperature changes over the years.</p>
<p>In any case, I'm happy to say a Province reader from Australia has warmed to my way of thinking. Melissa Ruyter writes from Queensland to tell the aforementioned Dunsmuir to "please stop fear-mongering." Australia, Ruyter writes, is no more uninhabitable than Canada or any other developed nation. And no more people are starving and dying there than in Canada.</p>
<p>"Flooding in Northern Queensland is a normal occurrence and was worse this year, but was no more tragic than the more-than- average snowfall in Vancouver this year," she said.</p>
<p>"The reef is struggling in areas but thriving in others." In other words, those who've been encouraged to believe Australia -- or Antarctica -- are soon going the way of the dodo bird should find another target for their fears.</p>
<p>As for the climate, Premier Gordon Campbell would like you to think he can help change it with his carbon tax. I think that's less likely than the Aussies giving up beer.</p>

</p>
<p>Seven new cases of H1N1 flu were found in B.C. yesterday, raising the total number of reported infections to 29.</p>
<p>"We will likely find more cases," said Roy Wadia, spokesman for the B.C. Centre for Disease Control. "This is normal when more and more people are being tested. A fair number of folks have this strain."</p>
<p>Five of the new cases are in the Fraser Health area between Burnaby and Hope. The other two are on Vancouver Island.</p>
<p>Wadia said five of the seven victims had recently travelled to Mexico. The others will be interviewed to gain more information on how they may have been exposed.</p>
<p>"The majority of cases are travel-linked. There have been few cases of secondary transmissions in B.C.," he said.</p>
<p>Wadia said reports that all the B.C. cases have been "mild" may be misleading.</p>
<p>"It's influenza. Like a normal seasonal flu, you feel horrible and wiped out. There is a fever and prolonged coughing," he said.</p>
<p>He said there has been a "flurry" of visits to emergency rooms, but hospitals have not been flooded.</p>
<p>He advised those feeling ill to call the recently-instituted 8-1-1 health line or see their family doctor.</p>
<p>"The emergency room should not be the first port of call," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Two more people on Vancouver Island have been diagnosed with swine flu, health officials said yesterday.</p>
<p>The new cases, two women between 45 and 60 years old from Victoria and the Comox Valley, bring the total number on the Island to six, all adult women.</p>
<p>As in the previous four cases, the two women recently returned from a trip to Mexico, believed to be the origin of the flu outbreak. Both went to the doctor complaining of flu-like symptoms a week ago on April 29, said Vancouver Island Health Authority medical officer Dr. Charmaine Enns.</p>
<p>Fluid samples were sent to the B.C. Centre for Disease Control in Vancouver and the results confirming the H1N1 influenza came back Saturday night and yesterday morning.</p>
<p>Enns said the centre has been flooded with hundreds of samples every day, which is likely why the test results took so long.</p>
<p>Anyone who goes to a doctor with symptoms of the virus is advised to remain isolated until their results come in, she said.</p>
<p>"I'm not all that worried about the swab taking [several] days, because people were doing the right thing in the meantime."</p>
<p>No Island cases have resulted from secondary transmission of the illness, Enns said.</p>
<p>The existing four Island cases include 30-year-old Michelle Bossi from Victoria, a woman from the southern part of the Island and two from the north.</p>
<p>Neither of the two women most recently diagnosed had to be hospitalized, Enns said. All the Island cases so far have been mild.</p>
<p>There is no evidence that women are more susceptible to the virus, Enns said, but women are more likely to get checked by their doctors.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, the number of confirmed cases of swine flu in British Columbia jumped to 29, while the number in Canada hit 101.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization cautioned people yesterday to avoid unnecessary contact with animals sick with the A H1N1 virus, while an infectious disease expert in Hong Kong warned the risk of a swine flu pandemic has dramatically increased, after more than 200 pigs on a central Alberta hog farm were found infected with human swine flu on the weekend.</p>
<p>It's believed the Alberta case is first time anywhere in the world the new H1N1 influenza A virus has been found in pigs.</p>
<p>The discovery had experts weighing in yesterday on what, if any, measures should be taken now that the virus has spread to animal herds.</p>
<p>Some countries have banned Canadian pork products, despite protests from the industry that the meat is safe.</p>
<p>"A lot of these bans are knee-jerk reactions," said Jurgen Preugschas, chairman of the Canadian Pork Council. "The impact, though, is severe."</p>
<p>A WHO official agreed the consumption of pork is safe and said there are no plans to put down any of the infected animals.</p>
<p>Canadian officials said consumers should not be concerned about the virus entering the food chain.</p>
<p>"The virus, H1N1 influenza A, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population," Dr. Brian Evans, executive vice-president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Canada's chief veterinary officer.</p>
<p>"The chance that these pigs could transfer the virus to a person is remote."</p>

<p>Late last night, China announced it was stopping imports of Alberta pork because of the discovery of H1N1 flu virus in a herd of pigs in the province.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization again stressed yesterday the flu strain is not food-borne and as long as pork is properly cooked, there's no chance of infection.</p>
<p>China is the eighth-largest importer of Canadian pork, according to Canada Pork International.</p>
<p>The discovery of the swine flu in the Alberta pigs has raised a spectre that worries experts: the possibility of the virus moving back and forth between humans and pigs, giving it more chances to mutate.</p>

</p>
<p>The discovery of the new swine flu in pigs on an Alberta farm raises a spectre that worries influenza experts: the possibility of the virus moving back and forth between humans and pigs, giving it more chances to mutate along the way.</p>
<p>About 220 pigs in a herd of 2,200 showed signs of the flu April 24, Canadian officials said on the weekend.</p>
<p>A farmhand who travelled to Mexico and fell ill upon his return is believed to have infected the pigs with the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>Late last night, China said it was stopping imports of Alberta pork after Canadian officials confirmed yesterday the Alberta pigs were infected with the virus. While the development did not come as a surprise to the World Health Organization or other experts, they expressed concern.</p>
<p>"We expected that at some point since this virus has swine virus elements that we would find possibly the virus in swine pigs in the region where the virus is circulating," Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO food safety scientist, said yesterday from Geneva.</p>
<p>Measures should be taken to prevent further human exposure to sick animals because of a risk people around the pigs could become infected, Embarek said.</p>
<p>"It has happened in the past with classical swine influenza," he said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Canada's swine flu caseload swelled yesterday to 101 after health officials in British Columbia, Alberta Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec and Nova Scotia reported 16 more cases. Worldwide, the WHO has confirmed 898 cases in 18 countries.</p>
<p>On the weekend, Ontario reported four more confirmed cases of the virus, bringing the total number of cases in the province to 16.</p>
<p>Three of the cases were reported in Toronto, two of them yesterday, with the other in York region. The province for the first time confirmed two person-to-person transmissions, where a person picked up the virus from somebody who had been to Mexico.</p>
<p>"It wasn't a big surprise," said Mark Nesbitt, a spokesperson for the Ontario Ministry of Health. "We were really expecting this because this is like other infection situations with cold and flu, and it spread through coughing and sneezing."</p>
<p>All 16 confirmed Ontario cases are considered "mild," said Nesbitt, and the individuals did not require hospitalization.</p>
<p>As new cases were reported across the country, Health Canada advised Canadians yesterday not to purchase products claiming to fight or prevent the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>"While there are approved antiviral drugs that may help prevent or reduce the symptoms associated with the flu in general, there are currently no products authorized for sale in Canada that are indicated specifically for the treatment of H1N1 flu virus," the agency said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, pork is perfectly safe to eat, the World Health Organization and Canadian pork producers insisted yesterday.</p>
<p>"You don't get this disease through eating pork, and therefore there is no reason to be afraid of eating pork or pork products," Embarek said from Geneva.</p>
<p>There are no recommendations at this point from various agencies to cull pigs in Alberta or anywhere in the world, Embarek said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Swine Flu On Wane: Mexico; Quarantined Alberta hogs likely infected by farm worker</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>663 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>Public-health officials said yesterday they were watching closely for movement of the swine-flu virus between people and pigs after a Canadian herd became infected, but took pains to counter a growing fear around the world of pork products.</p>
<p>As a quarantine was imposed on an unnamed Alberta hog farm where 220 of the herd contracted the novel flu, the largely unfounded fear of eating pig meat continued to generate controversy. In Egypt, Coptic Christian pig owners battled police over a government-ordered cull of their animals, traditionally considered unclean by the country's Muslim majority.</p>
<p>The flu's progress through the human population, meanwhile, showed signs of slowing, with Mexican authorities saying their country appears to be over the peak of the epidemic that began there last month. Worldwide, there have been 898 confirmed cases, and 20 confirmed deaths, all but one in Mexico.</p>
<p>Canada has recorded 101 infections, most of them mild.</p>
<p>The Alberta pigs were believed infected by a farm worker who had recently returned from Mexico with flu-like illness, marking the first evidence of the virus jumping from people to hogs.</p>
<p>It is such movement between species that can sometimes lead to mutation in influenza -- potentially making it more or less virulent -- so experts are eager to prevent pigs re-infecting people or poultry.</p>
<p>"There is no sign that it has changed at all but this could, of course, happen, like with any other influenza virus," said Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, an animal disease scientist with the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>"It's important to monitor the situation, study the viruses we isolate, increase surveillance in humans and animals," he told a news conference.</p>
<p>Scientists suspect that the new H1N1 flu, made up of pig, bird and human influenza genes, originated in hogs.</p>
<p>Canadian experts said yesterday that the chances of the virus changing -- or re-assorting -- as a result of the leap from humans back to pigs are slim.</p>
<p>Given that the virus is made up mostly of pig flu genes, there would be very little pressure for it to change in an infected hog, said Dr. Todd Hatchette, a microbiologist at Dalhousie University in Halifax.</p>
<p>"This should not be seen as a milestone event," said Dr. Fred Aoki, a medical microbiologist at the University of Manitoba in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Dr. Aoki noted that the avian flu virus, H5N1, which first raised fears of a pandemic a few years ago, has had ample opportunity in the past 10 years to mutate into a form that is more readily transmissible among people, yet that has not happened.</p>
<p>Regardless, a number of countries have imposed bans on importing pork products from Mexico or, in some cases, all of North America. Egypt has taken the most drastic action, ordering the destruction of all its 250,000 pigs, which are mostly owned by the Coptic Christian minority, some of them garbage collectors who use the hogs to consume organic waste.</p>
<p>Dr. Embarek said studies have shown that flu viruses are very susceptible to heat, meaning cooking will kill any threat to consumers.</p>
<p>The process used to cure meats, such as some ham, has the same effect, he said.</p>
<p>"There is no reason to start destroying these wonderful, cured products," he said. "You can continue to safely eat your prosciutto."</p>
<p>In Mexico, the epicentre of the virus, health officials said it appears the epidemic peaked between April 23 and 28, and that the virus may be no more virulent than the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Dr. Embarek warned that it is important, though, not to become complacent, noting that the 1918 pandemic started mildly in the spring, then returned with a deadly vengeance in the fall.</p>
<p>Dr. Hatchette said he agrees that continued vigilance is wise, but said it would seem unlikely that the current bug will turn into a mass killer of 1918 proportions.</p>

<p>The week in sports quotes</p>
<p>"It's bad in Mexico. They're not allowing anyone to go to the soccer games. They're playing them, just no fans are in the stands. Just like soccer here in the United States." --David Letterman, on the swine flu.</p>
<p>"You don't often hear, 'Congratulations, you're going to Detroit.' " --From Letterman's Top Ten Thoughts That Went Through Matthew Stafford's Mind On Draft Day, after Stafford was selected first overall by the Detroit Lions.</p>
<p>"Why does Jessica Simpson keep calling me?" --From the same list.</p>
<p>"The teams that talk about relocation do it for financial leverage. They have no intention of leaving. The teams that play dumb are the ones that disappear in the middle of the night, and we all know Jerry Moyes has some trucks available, if necessary." --Dan Bickley, of The Arizona Republic, on the fiscally troubled Phoenix Coyotes and their owner, Moyes, whose main business is a transportation company.</p>
<p>"Countless hours in the weight room. Countless hours in the cafeteria." --Seattle Seahawks first-round pick Aaron Curry, on how he got big enough to be an NFL player while at Wake Forest.</p>
<p>"In an otherwise large, ecstatic gathering of Andre Smith's family and friends, a baby is crying--apparently the only one aware that he's been selected by the Bengals." --Syndicated columnist Norman Chad, with an entry from his diary of the NFL draft.</p>
<p>"The Raiders' draft room, I suppose, consists of Al Davis, a change of sweatsuits and a Ouija board." --Chad.</p>
<p>"The Pistons also felt Iverson would give them a different chance in the playoffs --not necessarily a better chance, but a different chance. Dumars acknowledged as much Wednesday, when he said he had 'rolled the dice' for one season. Dumars joked that 'it came up snake eyes.' It's probably more accurate to say the dice rolled right off the table into a pile of dog poop." --Michael Rosenberg, of the Detroit Free Press, on the disaster that followed Detroit Pistons GM Joe Dumars' trade for Allen Iverson.</p>
<p>"I speak a little. It's not very good. I'm better at reading than I am anything else. Or 'Take out the trash,' or 'Clean the house,' 'Wash dishes.' I understand those." --Tiger Woods, on learning to speak Swedish thanks to wife Elin.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization cautioned people on Sunday to avoid unnecessary contact with animals sick with the A H1N1 virus, while an infectious disease expert in Hong Kong warned the risk of a swine flu pandemic has dramatically increased, after more than 200 pigs on a central Alberta hog farm were found infected with human swine flu on the weekend.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Sunday, Canada reported 16 new cases of swine flu, bringing its total to 101.</p>
<p>It's believed the Alberta case is the first time anywhere in the world the new H1N1 influenza A virus has been found in pigs. The discovery had experts weighing in Sunday on what, if any, measures should be taken now that the virus has spread to animal herds.</p>
<p>There were reports early Sunday that China had banned the import of pork from Alberta. But Sunday afternoon, the executive director of Alberta Pork Producers Development Corporation said those reports were incorrect.</p>
<p>"I just got off a Canadian Food Inspection Agency-led conference call for industry, and they were aware of the story circulating, but they say it is not true," Paul Hodgman said Sunday. "No ban has taken place officially."</p>
<p>Sunday, a WHO official agreed the consumption of pork is safe and said there are no plans to put down any of the infected animals.</p>
<p>"At present there is no recommendation for culling," said Dr. Peter Ben Embarek, adding WHO officials will look into whether more control measures are needed to protect human health. As of Sunday morning, the number of cases worldwide had climbed to 786.</p>
<p>Canadian officials said consumers should not be concerned about the virus entering the food chain.</p>
<p>"We have determined that the virus, H1N1 influenza A, found in these pigs, is the virus which is being tracked in the human population," Dr. Brian Evans, executive vice-president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Canada's chief veterinary officer, told reporters.</p>
<p>"The chance that these pigs could transfer the virus to a person is remote. Nevertheless, we are following an appropriately measured approach," Evans said, stressing there is "no food safety concern related to this finding. Consumption of pork is not considered a route of transmission to humans."</p>
<p>Although he says the food is safe, Dr. Ho Pak-leung, associate professor at the University of Hong Kong's microbiology department, is concerned the transmission of the flu virus from humans to pigs indicates a new medium of transmission for the virus.</p>
<p>Ho says he believes this H1N1 flu virus will become increasingly difficult to control if more pigs are infected by this human swine flu virus.</p>
<p>The transfer of a flu virus from humans to pigs is not unheard of, he says, pointing out the influenza viruses of the Hong Kong flu pandemic also transferred from humans to pigs, and vice versa. That pandemic killed nearly one million people in 1968 and 1969.</p>
<p>"Once the human virus is transmitted to pigs, anyone that comes in contact with infected pigs will have a chance of contracting this (H1N1) virus," he says.</p>
<p>There's also a high risk the virus can mutate inside infected pigs, Ho adds, creating new strains of the animal flu.</p>
<p>"A single pig can be infected with different influenza viruses," he says. "So, there's a chance that the genes of the influenza virus may 'shuffle' inside the pigs ... forming a new virus."</p>
<p>However, Ho stresses that pork products are safe to eat, since the H1N1 disease cannot be contracted from eating cooked pork, as the flu virus is killed at temperatures of 70 C.</p>
<p>So far, the Philippines, El Salvador, Honduras and Ukraine have stopped accepting Canadian pork since the H1N1 cases were identified in Canada, while South Korea is not accepting live hogs. Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz urged Canada's trading partners to make decisions based on "sound science," not emotion.</p>

</div><div>Craig Pearson   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>550 words</div><div>4 May 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>It isn't the honeymoon they expected, spending a romantic Mexican vacation in the middle of a swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>Windsor newlyweds Alice and Bill Hunter have not run into anybody infected with the disease that has sparked worldwide concern. But though the Hunters have enjoyed their time on the Mayan Riviera -- swine flu has affected their honeymoon.</p>
<p>They were herded along with hundreds of others into one resort, since occupancy at three area hotels was so low.</p>
<p>They return home today without having left the resort.</p>
<p>"They closed the Riu Tequila due to low guest numbers, because of all the flights that have been cancelled," Alice said Sunday night by phone from her hotel room at the Riu Yucatan. "I think they closed two of their other resorts and put everyone here, so it's pretty busy.</p>
<p>"A lot of people are quite grumpy now and disgruntled that they have been shuffled around, and that it's so crowded. A lot of people were transferred here today and the lineup in the lobby was crazy, trying to get the rooms ready."</p>
<p>The Mexican government has scaled back its original estimate of 176 deaths, saying only 19 of the suspected 100 deaths from the H1N1 virus had been confirmed.</p>
<p>Dr. Allen Heimann, the Windsor-Essex County medical officer of health, said Sunday he still had not heard whether any of the 20 suspected cases in Windsor, mostly people who had recently travelled to Mexico, were confirmed as swine flu.</p>
<p>"I suspect that some of these cases will be positive," Heimann said. "But what we're looking at are mild cases. The individuals were advised to isolate themselves at home. The information I have is that none of them required hospitalization or anti-viral therapy."</p>
<p>Some observers have criticized the World Health Organization for overreacting to what may turn out to be a relatively minor strain of flu, though the WHO on Sunday warned that a second wave of the illness is possible.</p>
<p>The global concern was enough to convince the Hunters to scale back their Mexican exploration.</p>
<p>"We haven't encountered swine flu, though there are a couple of people wearing masks at our new resort," Alice said. "We were going to do some excursions but we decided not to go out anymore. We pretty much stayed on the resort."</p>
<p>Alice described the pool where the couple first stayed as sparsely used, "almost like having your own private pool."</p>
<p>Alice, 25, an early childhood educator, and Bill, 26, who is laid off as an HBPO employee because of the Chrysler shutdown, were married April 25 in Windsor and left for Mexico two days later, because they had not purchased cancellation insurance.</p>

<p>With its potential to thwart the biggest money-making season for everything from concert tours and movies, to theatre productions and festivals, the swine flu looms large over the entertainment industry's summer prospects.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization has issued a level-five pandemic alert for the swine flu -- one stage below a full-blown pandemic, when a disease is considered common among the general population. If that happens, it could spell trouble for the entertainment business.</p>
<p>"I think a pandemic would have an immediate and profound impact on these industries," said Michael Mulvey, a marketing and social-trends expert at the Telfer school of management at the University of Ottawa. "I think a considerable segment of people would avoid going to concerts and movie theatres, because most entertainment consumables are elective expenditures. You could watch a movie at home, for instance.</p>
<p>"Home is a sanctuary, a place people fall back to in times of crisis and unease. It happened during the SARS crisis and after 9/11, too, when people avoided public spaces."</p>
<p>The major U.S. movie studios, gearing up for the lucrative summer box-office season, continue to monitor the swine flu situation in Mexico and the rest of the world. In one week, Paramount's Star Trek is scheduled to open globally and Warner Bros.' Terminator Salvation is set to hit theatres May 20.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Twentieth Century Fox</span> already postponed the Wednesday premiere of X-Men Origins: Wolverine in Mexico City, and delayed the theatrical opening scheduled for Friday. The Mexican release of Star Trek has also been delayed, while <span class="companylink">Sony</span> has reportedly pushed back two of the country's opening dates: Angels & Demons to June 12 from May 15, and Terminator Salvation to July 31 from June 5.</p>
<p>"From the . . . studios' perspective, it would be a big deal to shift release dates, because the blockbusters are synchronized worldwide and run on a really tight schedule," Mulvey said.</p>
<p>In the case of concert promoters, he said he hopes they're well-insured, noting the large cost involved in tours. "But to some extent, they have to accept responsibility for their patrons; it's a human right," Mulvey added.</p>
<p>And what might happen to fans who've already bought tickets? "For people who've already doled out money for upcoming events, such as the Bob Dylan and Fleetwood Mac concerts, you have to decide: Should you stay or should you go?" Mulvey said.</p>
<p>"People learn to manage risk," he added. "There was a lot of hyper-sensationalism with West Nile virus, but it didn't stop people from camping and boating. They just get smarter and more proactive to protect themselves."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Little evidence that quarantine helps; What you should know</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>648 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Part II of our Q & A primer on the swine flu, compiled by Gazette medical reporter Aaron Derfel: Should people infected with the H1N1 virus be quarantined? At present, the government is not considering a police-enforced quarantine. What's more, there is little evidence that quarantines work, since about one in two people who catch the flu appear to be fine for a day or two before eventually developing symptoms.</p>
<p>Still, hospitals do isolate patients with suspected or confirmed cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>There are people with mild cases who are recovering at home, and they are being told to stay put until they get better. The period of self-quarantine would be seven days. For practical purposes, an infected person would subtract 24 hours from the start of symptoms and count six days forward.</p>
<p>Should people wear masks, as they have been doing in Mexico? The Public Health Agency of Canada is not recommending that healthy people wear masks as they go about their daily lives in the community.</p>
<p>"There is no evidence to suggest that wearing masks will prevent the spread of infection in the general population." How fast is this swine flu spreading? No one knows exactly, but it appears to be spreading more slowly than expected.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists use the term R zero, or reproduction rate, to refer to the spread of an infectious disease. Usually influenza has an R rate of 12, meaning that an infected person will pass the virus to 12 people through hand contact and coughing.</p>
<p>Preliminary information indicates that the swine flu virus has a R rate of only two, said Brian Ward, associate director of the research institute of the McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>"Compared with other influenza viruses, it looks like it's not easily transmitted," Ward said.</p>
<p>Like all flu viruses, this one will continue to mutate and could become more infectious. However, Ward cautioned that Montreal would have to be hit with hundreds of cases of swine flu - with human-to-human transmission and deaths increasing dramatically each week - for local authorities to consider the public restrictions now in place in Mexico, the source of the new strain.</p>
<p>Given that it's called the swine flu virus, can one become infected from eating pork? No. Unlike listeriosis, swine flu is not a food-borne illness. The World Health Organization no longer refers to the virus as the swine flu, but H1N1.</p>
<p>Since all the swine-flu cases in Canada have been mild, does this mean that we will be spared a deadly pandemic? Not necessarily. The 1918-19 Spanish flu pandemic - which killed as many as 40 million people around the world - came in three waves and the first wasn't nearly as lethal as the second.</p>
<p>Still, experts are cautiously optimistic because the spread of the virus has been relatively slow and cases outside Mexico have been mild.</p>
<p>"If we are able to control the virus within the next two or three weeks on a world scale, we will probably do well," said Karl Weiss, a microbio- logist at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital.</p>
<p>Canada and other countries are also much better prepared than they were in 1918. Back then, the WHO didn't even exist. Today, the WHO can track a pathogen in real time and issue alerts accordingly.</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies have the capacity to manufacture millions of doses of flu vaccine within months. When people get sick, they can be treated with anti-viral medications like Tamiflu.</p>
<p>And if they develop severe complications like pneumonia, they can be treated with antibiotics, which didn't exist in 1918. Finally, Canada and other nations have pandemic preparedness plans, which they have already activated.</p>

</div><div>AFP</div>

</p>
<p>A 4-month-old U.S. baby yesterday was undergoing tests for swine flu in Japan, the country's latest suspected case of the virus, officials said.</p>
<p>The baby, whose sex was not made public, had tested positive for type-A flu strain in a preliminary examination shortly after arriving at Tokyo's U.S. Yokota Air Base from the United States with its family on Friday, the Foreign Ministry said.</p>
<p>Samples from the baby were sent to the National Institute of Infectious Diseases in Tokyo, and "they are now under examination to judge if they are the new flu virus," said Foreign Ministry official Toshiyuki Maeda. It was not known when the results would be ready.</p>
<p>However, the Kyodo news agency reported early today a "Japanese government source" as saying the baby "is unlikely to have been infected with the disease" citing test results, it said.</p>
<p>The baby, being treated in an isolated bedroom at the base, had a temperature but other passengers, including its mother, had tested negative, officials and news reports said.</p>

</p>
<p>A child in the West Island has been confirmed with the province's second case of swine flu.</p>
<p>Alain Poirier, Quebec public health director, said a student at CollËge Charlemagne in Pierrefonds has a "mild case" of the flu that so far has affected 80 Canadians.</p>
<p>The child had returned last week with his parents from a vacation in Mexico, Poirier said, adding that he did not know where in the country the family vacationed.</p>
<p>The child's ailment was diagnosed Friday. The name, age and sex were not made public. The youngster is at home and "doing well," Poirier said.</p>
<p>He said the child returned to school after the vacation. For this reason, parents of other children at the school have been informed.</p>
<p>"Since that child went to school, we have been in close collaboration with the school."</p>
<p>The public health director said that he didn't believe the child's classmates are at risk, but cautioned parents to keep an eye out for flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Poirier refused to say whether the parents of the child have been examined for the flu virus.</p>
<p>"We try to protect as much as possible information about specific cases," he said.</p>
<p>There is no reason to close the primary school, because there is no evidence that this would have an effect on the spread of the virus, Poirier said.</p>
<p>History shows that closing schools does not necessarily stop the progress of viruses, he said.</p>
<p>"If children are not (in school) they are somewhere else and parents have to take care of children. We have arrived at the conclusion that, according to what we know in the past. when schools have been closed, it would be easier to manage infection without closing schools. This doesn't mean we will never do it."</p>
<p>Canadian health officials are keeping a close watch on all cases and are coordinating with the Canadian and World Health Organization officials as they examine the mutations of the virus, Poirier said.</p>
<p>Since Mexico was late in identifying the virus, researchers must go back to old cases to obtain specimens, he said.</p>
<p>So far, Poirier said, the 80 cases in Canada indicate that the virus is relatively mild compared with bird flu.</p>
<p>"We were preparing for something a little more aggressive."</p>
<p>Poirier said parents can get details about the virus and preventative methods on the website www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca[http://www.pandemiequebec.gouv.qc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca].</p>
<p>The total cases worldwide has climbed to nearly 700.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>220 pigs infected in Alberta; 85 Canadians 'No food-safety concern related to this finding'</b>
</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY AND LINDA NGUYEN   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>868 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Officials scrambled yesterday to assure Canadians the country's food supply is safe after confirming that more than 200 pigs on a central Alberta hog farm have been infected with human swine flu.</p>
<p>It's believed its' the first time anywhere in the world the new H1N1 influenza A virus has been found in pigs.</p>
<p>"We have determined that the virus, H1N1 influenza A, found in these pigs, is the virus that is being tracked in the human population," Brian Evans, executive vice-president of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and Canada's chief veterinary officer, told reporters.</p>
<p>"The chance that these pigs could transfer the virus to a person is remote. Nevertheless, we are following an appropriately measured approach," Evans said, stressing there is "no food-safety concern related to this finding. Consumption of pork is not considered a route of transmission to humans."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, 34 new human cases of swine flu were confirmed yesterday, bringing the total number of confirmed cases in Canada to 85.</p>
<p>"We continue to see mild cases and full recovery in Canada, but our vigilance and efforts need to continue, and our heightened surveillance will lead to more and more confirmed cases," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer, said. He said the risk to most Canadians remains low.</p>
<p>Most of the new cases come from Nova Scotia, where 17 new cases were reported. Seven more were from B.C., another seven were from Alberta, plus two in Ontario, and one in Quebec.</p>
<p>Humans and pigs can pass flu strains back and forth through direct close contact, such as on pig farms. When a swine flu virus affects a human, there's also a risk the animal flu can mutate, then spread directly between people. That's how the new swine flu in humans evolved.</p>
<p>Now the virus has gone from people to pigs.</p>
<p>Federal officials believe the infected pigs contracted the virus from a Canadian worker who returned from Mexico on April 12 and arrived on the farm two days later, showing flu symptoms shortly thereafter. One other person on the farm has had mild symptoms. Officials are awaiting test results.</p>
<p>Both the worker and the approximately 220 infected pigs are recovering, but the animals have been quarantined to prevent possible transfer to humans, Evans said.</p>
<p>The transfer of a flu virus from humans to pigs is not unheard of, he added. "The key here is that influenza viruses do not affect the safety of pork."</p>
<p>Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz urged Canada's trading partners to make decisions based on "sound science," not emotion. On Wednesday, Egypt ordered a nationwide pig slaughter as a precaution against swine flu.</p>
<p>Ritz said he spoke to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack to make him aware of the situation. "He has assured me that Canadian hog producers will continue to have access to the American market," Ritz said in a statement. "We will continue to work with our American partners as we deal with this issue."</p>
<p>Evans said the infected pigs are responding well. When asked if he would eat pork from the pigs once they recover, Evans said, "I would have no issue eating pork from these pigs. That's my personal position."</p>
<p>Nova Scotia's chief public health officer said that, of the province's 17 new cases reported yesterday, six have no connection with a private boarding school that recently sent a music class to Mexico. In all cases in the province prior to Saturday, all had a link to King's-Edgehill School in Windsor, N.S.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Strang said provincial health officials have been on alert for the swine flu to spread outside of the school. All the patients are experiencing mild symptoms.</p>
<p>"None of these people have been hospitalized. We're not hearing reports of anything other than the mild flu symptoms," he said at a news conference. "Outside of Mexico, in Canada, the swine flu is a mild disease."</p>
<p>He urged residents to "remember that daily activities should continue as normal. It is safe to go to school, work and socialize, as long as you do not have any symptoms."</p>
<p>In total, there are 31 cases of swine flu in Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>The total number of lab-confirmed cases in Alberta climbed to 15 yesterday. Of the new cases, all are adults except one male child. His age was not available.</p>
<p>The federal government, which has decided to hold a daily briefing when warranted, ran advertisements in newspapers across the country yesterday, calling for calm and more public awareness of the flu outbreak. Officials urge Canadians to continue regular handwashing to avoid infection.</p>
<p>Scientists at the National Microbiology Laboratory have begun full genome sequencing of the swine flu, also known as the H1N1 virus, Butler-Jones said.</p>

</p>
<p>As the swine flu count in Canada rose yesterday to 85, there was a new wrinkle in the crisis: 220 pigs in Alberta were found to be contaminated with the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Health officials say it's believed a human, who had come from Mexico, infected the swine, which have been quarantined. But there's no danger to humans from eating pork, they say; the virus isn't passed on through food.</p>
<p>In Montreal, a second case of the H1N1 flu has been confirmed: a student at a Pierrefonds private school who had been on a family vacation in Mexico. Like another Montrealer who got the flu, the student is recovering from a mild case, authorities say.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>2009--the year of the bailout pig</b>
</div><div>Mark Milke   </div>
<div>For the Calgary Herald</div>
<div>776 words</div><div>3 May 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>According to the Chinese calendar, 2009 is the year of the ox.</p>
<p>North Americans might be mistaken for thinking it's actually the year of the pig, and not because of the swine flu; the four-legged pink animal is a more appropriate mascot, given how many companies and sectors have wiggled up to governments to ask for aid in this year alone.</p>
<p>The list is almost endless and range from the brazen --the U. S. porn industry when represented by Larry Flynt who was at least half-joking, to the reckless --see major players in the U. S. financial sector, to the predictable--the automotive sector, which has sought taxpayer money in good times and bad.</p>
<p>On the automotive industry, it's worth recalling the public dollars already sent to automotive companies before the financial meltdown, precisely because their time at the public trough is not a recent phenomenon.</p>
<p>Between 2004 and 2008 alone, more than $750 million was sent to Canada's automotive sector from the federal and Ontario governments in the form of grants or "repayable" contributions, the latter often being anything but. Chrysler received $123 million; Toyota-- profitable though it was until this year, received $125 million; <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> took home $200 million, while Ford garnered $280 million with the rest spread among more minor players.</p>
<p>Now in a recession, two of the Detroit three have asked for and received billions from both the U. S. and Canadian governments. Thus, Chrysler (with $3 billion from our own Canadian government this past week for a two per cent stake in the company) and <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> serve as useful but expensive case studies in the folly of intervention by either Washington, D. C., or Ottawa.</p>
<p>Dennis DesRosiers, an auto industry consultant who tracks the numbers, points out that automobile sales in March in Canada were down by 15 per cent from the same month in 2008.</p>
<p>The declines ranged from a mild three per cent drop in Quebec, to a dramatic 31.3 per cent drop in both British Columbia and Alberta.</p>
<p>The March figures understate the magnitude of the decline. In the first quarter of 2009, automobile sales in Canada were down to 284,000 from 364,000 in the same quarter last year; that's almost a 22 per cent decline in year-to-date sales relative to 2008.</p>
<p>Who has suffered the most--not only inCanadian sales declines, but from similar U. S. drops? The former Big Three.</p>
<p>Total North American automobile sales reached a peak of 20.3 million in 2000 and declined to just over 16.1 million last year. Forecasts for 2009 are at 12.7 million unit sales with a slight recovery next year with 19.6 million in new automobiles sales in 2013.</p>
<p>The four-year-out numbers are probably optimistic. What's interesting is that the Detroit/Ontario Three are losing market share even faster than the general decline. This becomes evident from looking at the share of union-produced vehicles.</p>
<p>Desrosiers' calculations reveal that in 1995, 79 per cent of all new vehicle sales came from a factory with either the United Auto Workers (the U. S. automotive union) present or the Canadian Autoworkers Union (CAW) on the factory floor.</p>
<p>By last year, the UAWCAW share was 49.9 per cent. The forecast is for just under 46 per cent by 2013, again, perhaps rosy given the economic tsunami that hit the Detroit Three along with long-term declining consumer preferences for their products.</p>
<p>Chrysler declared bankruptcy protection this week to give it room to reorganize; <span class="companylink">General Motors</span> will soon follow.</p>
<p>Given that reality and falling sales, the Conservative government's decision to write a $3 billion cheque to Chrysler was even more pathetic.</p>
<p>The folly of subsidizing GM and Chrysler and taking shares is multiple. The "saved" jobs at those two companies come at the expense of employment at Ford, Toyota, and Hyundai; they are all after the same shrinking pie. And now the governments have an interest in those latter companies not beating Chrysler and GM into the dust.</p>
<p>Just as bad, the bailouts come at a great expense to consumers who thought they bought models from the latter group only to now find their taxes support automobile brands they don't want (or they would have bought them). But that's what happens when governments try to save automotive behemoths in the year of the pig.</p>

<p>Holed up in a ninth-floor boardroom at City Hall, a group of Calgary's top department officials convened an emergency meeting spurred by a troubling new virus gaining steam worldwide.</p>
<p>Armed with the city's 323-page infectious disease strategy, the team of about 20 people--including police, fire, EMS, transit and environmental protection members-- sat down early last week. It was the first of several gatherings to map the city's response to the new strain of H1N1, widely known as swine flu.</p>
<p>"One of the things I'm most confident about is our plan," said Tom Sampson, acting director of Calgary's Emergency Management Agency, who chairs the meetings.</p>
<p>As of Saturday, at least 15 Albertans-- including eight from Calgary --have contracted mild forms of the virus, which has also been identified in a central Alberta pig herd.</p>
<p>The outbreak has infected 700 people in 16 countries, swiftly tracking from Mexico, where it has killed about 100 people, across international borders. Cases outside of Mexico haven't been severe, but health authorities around the globe were put on alert as the World Health Organization increased its global pandemic alert to Level 5 on a six-stage scale, indicating a pandemic could be imminent.</p>
<p>Governments at all levels are dusting off their pandemic plans.</p>
<p>In Alberta, health officials placed the province's medical system on alert for the virus last Sunday, when the first Canadian cases were con-firmed in British Columbia and Nova Scotia.</p>
<p>Dr. Andre Corriveau, chief medical officer of health for Alberta, also activated a provincial pandemic operational centre last weekend.</p>
<p>"Our pandemic plan is already kicked in to some extent,"Corriveau told reporters last week.</p>
<p>"Our system is ready."</p>
<p>The Edmonton-based operations office--which is now open seven days a week -- is a 30-person command centre that allows Corriveau to communicate with regional health officials, federal officials and the public.</p>
<p>"The centre is operating 12 hours a day, seven days a week, and we'll increase that if necessary,"Health Minister Ron Liepert said Friday.</p>
<p>He added the centre's role is"making sure that all of the briefings are going to the right people."</p>
<p>In Calgary, the city's cross-departmental infectious disease management team has met every day since Tuesday and plans to come together twice a week as efforts to track the spread of the virus in Alberta continue, said Sampson.</p>
<p>The team liaises with Alberta Health, which is leading efforts in the province.</p>
<p>Early discussions centre mainly around communication and efforts to stymie the virus's spread by promoting simple healthy practices such as handwashing, Sampson said.</p>
<p>Though he stressed that a pandemic is far from the current reality in Alberta, he said the emergency team is poring over every scenario to deal with a full-blown outbreak.</p>
<p>Emergency teams are ready to snap into action to implement the city's infectious disease strategy, which closely mirrors the WHO's plan.</p>
<p>"From a stockpile perspective, from a training perspective, all sorts of things, we feel very confident that we're ready to go in the event we have a full-blown pandemic,"Sampson said.</p>
<p>He noted the city has a$1.5-million stockpile of gloves, gowns, masks and goggles purchased about two years ago that are "ready to go."</p>
<p>"We've been keeping that stock fresh. Now we look like geniuses, because, of course, it's very hard to find those things right now," he said.</p>
<p>Across the province, Alberta Health instructed all doctors last week to practise "enhanced surveillance" for flu-like illness, particularly when a patient has travelled to Mexico or the southern United States.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, when Alberta confirmed its first cases of swine flu in a Calgary man and a young boy from northern Alberta, Corriveau sent a letter to all doctors outlining how they should handle patients with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>"Your urgent attention to this matter is appreciated," said the letter.</p>
<p>The four-page document provides detailed instructions on how physicians should protect themselves, including asking the patient and doc-tor to both wear a mask during any assessment. It also asks physicians to alert the local medical officer of health of any suspect cases.</p>
<p>Some Calgary doctors'offices have implemented their own pandemic protocols.</p>
<p>By last Monday, one day after Canada's cases of swine flu hit headlines, Crowfoot Village Family Practice was ready. The receptionist at the front desk was instructed to move any patients with flu-like symptoms to an isolated room that had been set aside. The clinic posted a sign on the door telling patients to inform staff immediately if they thought they had the flu.</p>
<p>The clinic also has disposable gowns, goggles and a special kit with swabs to protect doctors who need to test any potential swine flu patients.</p>
<p>"We've thought this out," said Dr. Richard Ward, a physician at the northwest clinic who is also president of the Alberta College of Family Physicians. "We have a nurse who is in charge of our pandemic planning and we've started to implement some of the steps in the planning."</p>
<p>The clinic has not yet seen anyone who had symptoms of the new virus, but Ward said many patients were worried about the disease.</p>
<p>Alberta Health officials have said the province's pandemic planning was partly based on a SARS scenario, noting "we learned from SARS and have incorporated those lessons into our plans."But the current outbreak is so different from the 2003 SARS epidemic, which killed 44 people in Toronto, that provincial officials have been tweaking the plan.</p>
<p>One of the early changes to how health officials in Canada and Alberta have been approaching swine flu is how they are using the antiviral drug Tamiflu to treat influenza.</p>
<p>Corriveau said Alberta's plans originally called for the use of Tamiflu as a preventive measure for close contacts of infected patients, such as family members.</p>
<p>In Nova Scotia, where some of the first cases of swine flu appeared last week, some students at a private school were given Tamiflu after four of their classmates fell ill.</p>
<p>But Alberta has not treated family and contacts of infected patients with the drug because the virus is causing such mild illness. In fact, overuse of a drug like Tamiflu can lead the virus to become resistant to the medication, say experts.</p>
<p>"The general practice is moving toward not providing any Tamiflu unless there are very high risk factors," said Corriveau.</p>
<p>Alberta has a stockpile of about 6.7 million doses of Tamiflu on hand.</p>
<p>If the outbreak were to become far more serious and authorities declared a pandemic, the province's approach to dealing with the virus would likely change drastically.</p>
<p>Alberta Health's pandemic plan calls for the province to work with the Public Health Agency of Canada, the lead federal agency in a pandemic, but also kick-start its own emergency plan.</p>
<p>Public health measures would likely include restricting public gatherings and distancing those who are ill from others.</p>
<p>In a pandemic, authorities would also look at scaling back non-essential health-care services to make sure critical care was available for those affected by the virus, Sampson said.</p>
<p>Once the first batches of vaccine were ready, the federal pandemic plan has guidelines to dole it out on a priority basis, with the first groups including essential service providers such as health workers, police and firefighters, as well as elected officials.</p>
<p>Flu patients would also need some-where to go if hospitals are full, so non-traditional health-care sites would likely be set up in schools, churches and day-care centres; temporary morgues would also likely be created if necessary.</p>
<p>The Alberta Emergency Management Agency, which deals with all large-scale emergencies including fires and flooding, would work closely with health authorities and local officials in the more than 360 communities in the province.</p>
<p>"If there is a major emergency of that sort, our job is to look at the support communities would need: if people are sick, that we know about it and know the effects that would have in government and across communities so that essential services can (continue)," said Colin Lloyd, the agency's executive director of operations.</p>
<p>The province has a sophisticated response system that can be rolled out in less than two hours.</p>
<p>"We've got to be co-ordinated, we've got to be linked," Lloyd said.</p>
<p>More than anything, though, authorities are urging calm.</p>
<p>In Canada, particularly, the lessons learned from SARS have served the system well, said Dr.Glen Armstrong, head of the department of microbiology and infectious diseases in the University of Calgary's faculty of medicine.</p>
<p>All levels of government have pandemic preparedness protocols in place that were tightened following the SARS outbreak, he noted.</p>
<p>A huge responsibility rests with the general public, Armstrong added.</p>
<p>Handwashing, coughing into a sleeve and staying home when feeling ill are left to the sick person to self-enforce, he said.</p>
<p>"Following the various guidelines and taking the advice they're given --that's really the best thing people can do to protect themselves."</p>
<p>One week after the first Canadian cases of the new flu were discovered, it's not yet clear whether the outbreak will become a pandemic.</p>
<p>Cases of the disease outside Mexico have not been serious, but experts say there can be a second "wave" of a flu outbreak where a virus mutates, acquires additional traits and becomes more virulent.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer expressed optimism Friday the outbreak may turn out to be relatively mild.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones said the virus could die down over summer, buying time to develop a vaccine before the fall flu season.</p>
<p>Corriveau agreed, saying if the virus returns unchanged this fall and there is a vaccine, there will be little to worry about.</p>
<p>If that occurs, Alberta's top doctor argues the province will be more prepared than ever to deal with a future pandemic.</p>
<p>"Even if nothing happens, it will help us to improve planning and structures,"he said. "It's a real-time exercise, not a hypothetical one."</p>
