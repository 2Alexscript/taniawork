<p>Step Closer</p>
<p>By Tessa McWatt</p>
<p>HarperCollins, $32.99</p>
<p>One of the main characters in Tessa McWatt's latest novel is a young scientist doing research on swine viruses. Given that Step Closer would have been completed long before the global outbreak of swine flu, one wonders if McWatt has a crystal ball.</p>
<p>In any case, there is a lot more than prescient scientific research going on in this sprawling and complex work, whose themes include identity, belonging, self-knowledge, guilt, atonement, borders, language, history and migration.</p>
<p>Indeed, with such a variety of weighty themes, some may wonder if the writer's reach exceeds her grasp, but I'm happy to report that, a few rough patches aside, McWatt tames this turbulent tale with an efficiency that the World Health Organization could only envy.</p>
<p>The heroine of Step Closer is Emily, a 30-something Canadian who lives in Spain with her boyfriend, Sam, the aforementioned virus researcher. The 2004 tsunami has just caused mass destruction in Southeast Asia; it has also galvanized Emily's desire to excavate her past and come to deeper self-knowledge. To do this, she begins to write a story about two men who played a major role in her life.</p>
<p>The first is Marcus, an enigmatic and beautiful young black man, who was Emily's platonic roommate and fellow waiter at a bar in Pamplona. The second is Gavin Lake, an Englishman who arrives in Pamplona in a disoriented state -- looking, we learn, to atone to Marcus for some wicked event.</p>
<p>Soon after they meet, Gavin and Marcus embark on a pilgrimage on the Santiago de Compostela trail, or the Way of St. James, as pilgrims have done for more than 1,000 years. For reasons of her own, Emily intercepts them en route, and lives are changed as a result.</p>
<p>In the end, Emily decides that writing about life is not the same as living it, leading to a glorious declaration of personal progress that involves bulls, Vaseline and public nudity. But it's not what you might think.</p>
<p>McWatt, whose 2001 novel Dragon's Cry was nominated for a Governor General's Award, is a talented writer who has set herself a monumental task in this wide-ranging novel, with its subplots, shifts between past and present, and complicated cast of characters. For the temporal shifts, McWatt has Emily relate the past as a diary entry in which she herself plays a role, a device that works for the most part, although occasionally it comes off as contrived.</p>
<p>As for the subplots, we learn that Sam, too, has a secret and terrible past, which accounts for his growing increasingly distracted and distant from Emily.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, there is the running of the bulls, animal-rights activists, an unusual American woman who plays a role in the pilgrimage, and detailed discussions of virology -- through Emily, who researches the field while translating Sam's work into English.</p>
<p>Despite McWatt's steady hand, though, there are some annoying aspects to this novel. For example, we discover that Marcus and Gavin both attended a British reform school years before, and that something monumental and horrible happened there. We know it was monumental and horrible because the author keeps telling us so, a heavy-handed narrative device that is so overused that the revelation of the actual event falls a little flat.</p>
<p>McWatt also is given to occasional fits of writerly preciousness -- such as ending sentences with portentous single words. Like. This. And though the plot is complicated, the novel could have been shorter.</p>
<p>Quibbles aside, McWatt writes with sensitivity and passion, and as a Guyanese who moved to Canada and then to Britain, she writes convincingly of the experience of the exotic other. This alone would make Step Closer a satisfying read.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>To D or not to D: It's not a question; The science is clear: Vitamin D is an inexpensive pill with powerful benefits</b>
</div><div>Julie Mason   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>770 words</div><div>15 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>Like many Canadians, I begin each morning by taking pills. The biggest is a multivitamin the size of my thumb. A Clydesdale would have trouble choking it down. The smallest pill, no bigger than a Tic-Tac, may be the most powerful. The tiny vitamin D tablet seems to be a secret weapon against everything from cancer to swine flu.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, we got our vitamin D by lining up in our classroom for daily spoonfuls of cod liver oil. Today, milk and other food products like milk are fortified with enough vitamin D to prevent rickets, a childhood bone ailment.</p>
<p>Our body naturally produces 90 per cent of vitamin D through sun exposure, but our climate and our extensive use of sunscreens mean we don't get enough sun to naturally produce enough vitamin D. It's almost impossible to get enough from diet alone. Almost all Canadians will be vitamin D deficient at some point in the year.</p>
<p>At Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, Dr. Reinhold Vieth is the Canadian authority on vitamin D. He points out that vitamin D deficiency is linked to everything from colds and flu, heart disease and diabetes to over 30 varieties of cancer.</p>
<p>The most interesting research links vitamin D deficiencies to the incidence of cancer. One reputable study showed a 60 per cent reduction in the incidence of cancer among people who had higher levels of vitamin D, as compared to those who were vitamin D deficient. There's similar evidence linking vitamin D deficiencies with colorectal cancer, prostate cancer and breast cancer.</p>
<p>The evidence on cancer prevention has satisfied even the watchful eyes of the Canadian Cancer Society. In 2007, they recommended that all Canadians take supplements of 1,000 International Units (IU) of vitamin D daily throughout the fall and winter. Those who are older, have dark skin or who remain indoors or covered during the summer months should take the vitamin year round.</p>
<p>Recent studies in the United States have shown that vitamin D may also be part of the treatment for certain cancers. In both prostate cancer and colorectal cancer, doctors are using differing doses of vitamin D as part of treatment protocol and getting some encouraging results.</p>
<p>Recurrent prostate cancer can be a difficult disease to treat. In one study, men with recurrent disease were given 2,000 IU of vitamin D daily. Their blood PSA levels were monitored. Increasing PSA levels can indicate progressing disease. Sixty per cent saw their PSA blood level decrease or remain unchanged. There are also developments with colorectal cancer and breast cancer, but there's much more work to be done on using vitamin D for active cancers.</p>
<p>As Canadians line up in the cold for our H1N1 shots, the Public Health Agency of Canada is taking a hard look at the connection between severe influenza and low vitamin D levels. They're also interested in the protective effects of vitamin D: "New research suggests that vitamin D induces the production of antimicrobial substances in the body that possess neutralizing activity against a variety of infectious agents including the influenza virus."</p>
<p>Vitamin D is fat-soluble and is not excreted, so there is always a concern about toxicity if too much is taken. However most vitamin D researchers believe the Canadian Cancer Society recommendations are very conservative. Dr. Vieth at Mount Sinai Hospital has seen little chance of problems at 2,000-4,000 IU a day, and even doses as high of 10,000 IU a day "pose no known risk of adverse effects in virtually all adults."</p>
<p>The take-away message for individual Canadians is to buy a bottle of vitamin D. What you're looking for are 1,000 IU tablets of vitamin D3 or cholecalciferol -- most manufacturers just label the jar as vitamin D. I paid about $7 for 90 tablets. That's less than eight cents a day to meet the Canadian Cancer Society recommendation -- a very inexpensive pill with some powerful prevention benefits.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about your own vitamin D level and taking part in some science on the vitamin, check out D*action at www.grassrootshealth.net[http://www.grassrootshealth.net]. It's an international study to determine D levels and the impact of supplements. For a fee of $40, you can join the "open arm" of the study and find out your own vitamin D level.</p>

<p><span class="companylink">Disney</span> fights flu</p>
<p>ORLANDO, Fla. -- How about some hand sanitizer before greeting Mickey Mouse?</p>
<p>In an effort to halt the spread of the swine flu, <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span> World has installed dozens of hand-sanitizer dispensers throughout the theme park, hotel lobbies and character meet-and-greet areas, the Orlando Sentinel reported.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Disney</span> is also reminding visitors of basic health safety tips, like covering their mouths while sneezing and washing hands regularly, on fliers that list park hours and show times.</p>
<p>In all, more than 60 bulk hand sanitizer dispensers have been added at <span class="companylink">Disney</span> World and Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif.</p>
<p>The health precautions are the most visible steps taken by any of Orlando's major theme parks since the swine flu outbreak last spring.</p>
<p>Chilly hunger striker</p>
<p>ROME -- The UN food chief said Saturday he was chilly but otherwise slept OK after his first night on a hunger strike to draw attention to the plight of the world's hungry before next week's UN food summit.</p>
<p>Jacques Diouf began the 24-hour strike at 8 p.m. Friday in the lobby of the Rome-based UN Food and Agriculture Organization. Since FAO offices are unheated at night, he donned a hat and scarf, and wore his overcoat over his pyjamas as he spent the night on a makeshift mattress.</p>
<p>"I slept pretty well," Diouf said in a statement. "The only problem was the cold."</p>
<p>U.S. soldier remembered</p>
<p>KIEL, Wis. -- The hundreds of people who lined the main street of a small Indiana city Saturday fell solemnly silent as a white hearse passed by on its way to the church. Mourners streamed into a Wisconsin gymnasium to remember the soldier who once said she alone could take on Osama bin Laden.</p>
<p>Across the country, many stood before several flag-draped coffins during funeral services for several of the 13 victims of the Nov. 5 shootings at the Fort Hood Army post in Texas. Army psychiatrist Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, 39, was charged on Thursday with the shooting spree at Fort Hood. Army investigators have said Hasan is the only suspect and could face additional charges.</p>
<p>Bomber kills 11</p>
<p>PESHAWAR, Pakistan -- A suicide car bomber attacked a police checkpoint in northwest Pakistan on Saturday, killing 11 people, including four children, the latest in a wave of militant attacks that have claimed more than 300 lives in the past month.</p>
<p>The attack on outside Peshawar solidifies the city's ominous status as a primary target for militants trying to force the military to end an offensive against their associates launched last month in the border region of South Waziristan, where al-Qaida and Taliban leaders are believed to be hiding.</p>
<p>Strikes in the past week alone have killed more than 50 people in the city.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Waiting game worth it Saturday clinics vaccinate 2,416 people -</b>
</div><div>By Bill Redekop    </div>

<p>Despite long lineups, Saturday's H1N1 vaccination clinics were a godsend, said people at one of two clinics open on Saturday.</p>
<p>People anxious to get the H1N1 vaccine were lined up before 8 a.m. on Saturday at the Philippine Centre on Keewatin Street. The doors didn't open until 9:30 a.m., by which time the lineup stretched 40 metres.</p>
<p>People welcomed the weekend opening. Alison Miller's last day on her old job was Friday and she starts a new job on Monday.</p>
<p>Asking for time off for a flu shot in a new job was not in the cards, she said. Accompanying her in line were her twin five-year-old boys, Callum and Connor, and dad, Darren. They were looking forward to getting their shots over with.</p>
<p>"It will be peace of mind," Alison said.</p>
<p>Two other women in line at the clinic said they had tried to get shots at different clinics after work during the week, only to be turned away.</p>
<p>"I'm diabetic and this is my third time trying to get the shot," said Susan, one of the women.</p>
<p>"By the time you get home from work and feed the kids, it's too late."</p>
<p>It's tough to get time off when you work in a restaurant, she added. "Bosses don't usually like to be told their employee is going to be away two to three hours to stand in line."</p>
<p>Susan was twice turned away at the clinic at the Holy Eucharist Parish Centre on Munroe Ave., she said. Another woman said she had been turned away at the Garden City Shopping Centre clinic. A third woman, a teacher, said she couldn't get time off from work to get a shot.</p>
<p>A second vaccination clinic was opened at the University of Manitoba.</p>
<p>Both clinics stopped accepting newcomers by mid-afternoon, when staff determined they would only have time to vaccinate the hundreds already waiting. About 300 people were waiting at the U of M clinic when the decision to close was made.</p>
<p>A total of 2,416 people were vaccinated at the two clinics on Saturday, WRHA officials said, bringing the total number of people who have received the shot at city clincs to nearly 125,000.</p>
<p>The region's 12 clinics will all be open next week, Monday to Thursday, 9:30 a.m to 8 p.m, and Friday 9:30 a.m to 4 p.m.</p>
<p>If vaccine supply allows, special clinics will also be scheduled for next Saturday.</p>
<p>The H1N1 clinics are open for high-risk groups and children older that six months and younger than 18.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>WRHA plan ready to roll if flu strikes caregivers -</b>
</div><div>By Bill Redekop    </div>
<div>366 words</div><div>15 November 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>

<p>THE Winnipeg Regional Health Authority has a plan in case large numbers of health-care workers get the H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Just over half of Manitoba's 27,000 health providers have received the H1N1 vaccine. Providers are on the priority list and have their own clinics separate from public clinics.</p>
<p>But even people who get the vaccine can still catch H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>"The shot does not guarantee that you will not get sick. It does mean that if you do get sick that likely your illness will be less severe and of less length," WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham said. "It does take 10 days to two weeks for the vaccine to build up all the antibodies."</p>
<p>The plan earmarks hospitals, personal-care homes and Community Health Services sites across Winnipeg to set up clinics to treat staff with flu-like symptoms, if needed.</p>
<p>"If we do start to see a large number of staff becoming ill, we want to make sure they can easily access treatment" so they can get back on the front lines in the flu fight again.</p>
<p>Graham said the number of health workers vaccinated so far is "not bad at all," noting the program has been operating only three weeks, and during part of that time clinics were closed due to a vaccine shortage.</p>
<p>As well, the occupational clinics for health-care providers have moved around to different hospitals at different hours, making it difficult for health professionals to get to them. "We're continuing to see high turnouts at these clinics," she said, adding that the shots are not mandatory for health-care workers.</p>
<p>In a normal flu season, about 3,000 health-care professionals get vaccinated, she said.</p>
<p>They are on the priority list "because of the role staff play in a pandemic in terms of caring for members of the public who are sick," she said.</p>
<p>On Friday, 10 patients were in intensive-care units with severe respiratory illness in Winnipeg. Two adults were confirmed H1N1 cases and required ventilators to breathe, and five did not have H1N1. Test results on the others are pending.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Top 5 attractions where hygiene takes a holiday; kiss-kiss?: No thanks, I'm a germaphobe</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>625 words</div><div>15 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>
</p>
<p>With hand sanitizer flying off shelves and people forgoing large crowds to avoid catching swine flu, for many, basic hygiene seems to take a vacation when on holiday.</p>
<p>But last summer's poll of more than 4,600 travellers on tripadvisor.com revealed 34 per cent of travellers reported being more "germaphobic" by washing and disinfecting their hands more frequently when travelling since the swine flu outbreak. TripAdvisor forums also indicate travellers have got germs on the brain, with use of the words "germs," "sanitizer," and "disease" up 97 per cent, 182 per cent and 112 per cent, respectively. The poll looked at results between March and May of 2009 compared to the same period in 2008.</p>
<p>Here are what TripAdvisor's editors and readers thought were the top five germiest world attractions.</p>
<p>1. Kiss me, I'm filthy: Blarney Stone, Blarney, Ireland.</p>
<p>Legend says that those who kiss the Blarney Stone, a block of stone built into Ireland's Blarney Castle, are rewarded with eloquent speech. But given that up to 400,000 mouths from all over the world touch the stone each year, putting your own to the grimy attraction may be too high a price for the promised "gift of the gab."</p>
<p>2. Sticky situation: Wall of Gum, Seattle, Wash.</p>
<p>A bizarre tradition at Seattle's Market Theatre in Post Alley has turned into a fascinating yet very germy attraction: a giant wall of gum. In the 1990s, visitors began sticking their gum to the wall while waiting in line, resulting in a colourful and somewhat stomach-turning sight after more than a decade of gum gathering. Some intrepid visitors have even moulded shapes and faces out of their masticated gum. One TripAdvisor traveller reminds us, "Don't forget to contribute to the gum wall!"</p>
<p>3. Lip reading: Oscar Wilde's Tomb, Paris, France.</p>
<p>It is a testament to the love and respect felt by book-lovers and admirers the world over -- Oscar Wilde's tomb in Paris' Pere-Lachaise cemetery is famously covered in lipstick prints. But with a rainbow of hundreds of visible kiss marks adorning the grave, and countless more planted every year, isn't there a cleaner way to show your literary appreciation? One TripAdvisor traveller said, "The tombstone of Oscar Wilde is . . . well, wild, excuse the pun."</p>
<p>4. Foul fowl: St. Mark's Square, Venice, Italy.</p>
<p>A place of immeasurable beauty, Venice's famed St. Mark's Square has a dirty side: its thousands of hungry pigeons. Vendors no longer sell food to tourists to give to the birds, but they still flock in countless numbers, and many visitors choose to touch and even hold the pigeons. These dirty fowl have been known to leave foul unexpected gifts on tourists. One TripAdvisor traveller recalls, "I know it does seem a little bit disgusting, but it's so totally hilarious to see your friend/partner/dad being attacked by birds!"</p>
<p>5. Grubby mitts: Forecourt of Grauman's Chinese Theater (Handprints and Footprints), Hollywood, Calif.</p>
<p>The forecourt to this historical Hollywood landmark features the hand and footprints of some of the biggest stars in history. But this intimate look at Hollywood's hands can get a bit grimy given that millions of fans place their fingers in the moulds of their favourites. Consider bringing gloves or hand sanitizer before comparing your own paws to those of the greats. One TripAdvisor traveller said, "You couldn't help comparing your feet and hands, too (with those of the stars)."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>You can wash flu bugs clean away; workplace defences: Keeping hand sanitizers within easy reach is wise</b>
</div><div>Caitlin Crawshaw   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>508 words</div><div>15 November 2009</div><div>Vancouver Province</div><div>VANPRO</div><div>Final</div><div>A45</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Province   </div>

<p>With swine flu on the rise and winter on its way, workplaces all over the country are crossing their fingers that employees get the vaccine and updating their corporate plans in anticipation of greater employee absenteeism.</p>
<p>But while phone trees and emergency protocols are important, there's a lot that can be done on a daily basis to ward off bugs at work and maintain business as usual throughout the coming months.</p>
<p>Jan Chappell, a senior technical specialist with the Canadian Centre for Occupational Health and Safety, explains that regular employee hand-washing is crucial.</p>
<p>"People get wound up but really, it's just the normal, everyday stuff that you have to do," she says.</p>
<p>While Chappell isn't aware of any data suggesting a certain frequency of hand washing, doing it with some regularity -- and always after sneezing, eating or using the toilet -- should suffice. Regular soap and warm water, or gel sanitizers, will get the job done. Like many workplaces, her office has placed a number of dispensers on the walls for easy access.</p>
<p>Because the H1N1 virus travels about one to two metres every time an infected person sneezes or coughs, it's ideal to place workstations at least two metres apart. Ensuring the air in the office is properly ventilated is also important, says Chappell.</p>
<p>Just as absenteeism can cause serious productivity losses, so can presenteeism. Sick employees really do need to stay home -- especially those who are just starting to have symptoms. People are most contagious about eight hours before they come down with the flu, when they're just beginning to feel under the weather, she says. "There's toughing it out and then there's sharing the joy."</p>
<p>Peter Sheldon, a vice-president at Coverall Health-Based Cleaning Systems, believes that not all cleaning methods are equal. He says his company specializes in busting germs in commercial spaces. In his view, certain cleaning strategies can greatly reduce the spread of H1N1 at work.</p>
<p>"In today's world, things have changed. Twenty years ago, we didn't think about organisms coming into the workplace that could potentially kill us," says Sheldon. He says he's not interested in fearmongering but hopes to "educate people to take a defensive posture about potential threats."</p>
<p>Sheldon recommends companies talk to their janitorial service to ensure they're taking certain precautions, including using hospital-grade antibacterial/disinfectant cleaning products, microfibre cleaning cloths, and flat mops rather than conventional string mops.</p>
<p>Health-based cleaning is generally more efficient, says Sheldon, and shouldn't cost more than traditional cleaning strategies.</p>
<p>"You can't ever eliminate the unseen world. It's always been here and always will be, but you can put yourself in a position to minimize the risks."</p>

<p>A man who offered to sell a vial of H1N1 swine flu vaccine to the highest bidder in an online auction has admitted it was a hoax -- and turned himself in to police.</p>
<p>The man, 32, has apologized and no charges will be laid. Police also said the man is not a nurse.</p>
<p>The ad appeared Monday on the usedvictoria.com website, offering a 10-dose vial of H1N1 vaccine. It claimed to be from a registered nurse, who was prepared to administer it to the highest bidder.</p>

<p>Deck the halls with bottles of hand sanitizer. Fa la la la la la la la la.</p>
<p>It seems a lot of the Santas at your local shopping malls aren't taking any chances when it comes to the H1N1 pandemic this Christmas season.</p>
<p>Santa arrived at Richmond Centre on Friday armed with a new item in his sleigh -- hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>He'll be changing his gloves more often, and his crew of elves will be wiping down Santa Central in a bid to help prevent the spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Claus and myself have been inoculated," Santa told The Province on Saturday. "We are taking all the precautions -- we have sanitizing stations and 38 elves who will help with it." Mall marketing director Leslie Matheson said cleanliness is paramount this holiday season, with about 4,000 kids expected to sit on Santa's inoculated and sanitized lap.</p>
<p>"Santa has had his shots and we have hand sanitizer and gloves that he is going to change quite often," Matheson said. "We're encouraging parents to keep kids who have symptoms at home until they have recovered, and then come and visit Santa." Matheson added that cleanliness has been ramped up at the mall and its 240 stores and services since the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>"We're wiping all touch-points in the mall," Matheson said. "We have been for some time." Over at 200-store Coquitlam Centre -- where about 10,000 kids are expected to visit Santaland before Dec. 25 -- marketing director Deborah Stetz said germs are definitely on Santa's naughty list.</p>
<p>"We understand some parents may be concerned about taking their kids for a visit," Stetz said. "We've stepped-up our cleaning a bit." Hand sanitizers have been placed at the exit and entry to Santaland, Santa's chair is wiped down three times a day, Saint Nick will change his gloves every two hours and helpers will hand out sanitizing wipes to kids in line.</p>
<p>"Our helpers and production team are washing their hands frequently," Stetz said. "And we have added extra staff this year in anticipation of some of them getting sick." And Coquitlam Centre's Santa even has another hairy additional sanitary item -- a real beard.</p>
<p>"Real beards are more sanitary than fake beards," said Stetz. "Sometimes the synthetic ones are hard to clean." And yes, the mall even has a back-up Santa -- just in case its No. 1 gets sick.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Choreographer’s Vision is fixed, despite recent bout of H1N1</b>
</div><div>KATHRYN GREENAWAY   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>521 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>E9</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Dancer and choreographer Noam Gagnon is feeling punk. It’s Wednesday morning in Vancouver, and he’s talking to The Gazette about his impending visit to Montreal to perform the solo project the Vision Impure.</p>
<p>Gagnon hadn’t been out of bed since Sunday. Immediately after getting off a plane from Toronto that Saturday, he felt like he’d been hit by a truck. He could barely walk or talk and the exhaustion was so acute, he couldn’t open his eyes. He has since been diagnosed with both H1N1 flu and bronchitis.</p>
<p>“I was scared because I know H1N1 can go from bad to worse so quickly,” Gagnon said. But he’s got medicine, is on the mend, and says he feels confident he’ll be in good shape for the Montreal shows.</p>
<p>The Vision Impure opens for a four-day run at Usine C, Nov. 18.</p>
<p>Gagnon is half of the intensely physical, award-winning post-modern duo known as the Holy Body Tattoo. He and his other half, Dana Gingras, have been working together since 1987.</p>
<p>But two years ago, they decided to part ways to concentrate on solo projects. (They are still great friends and the Holy Body Tattoo has not shut down.)</p>
<p>Gagnon said it was as if they had become inextricably intertwined creatively. One could not be imagined without the other.</p>
<p>Gagnon said it was a struggle to find his individual voice and solo presence for the Vision Impure.</p>
<p>“But I feel confident people will see the full spectrum of what is me,” Gagnon said. “If they are expecting the intense physicality and high drama (of the Holy Body Tattoo), it’s still there. I run a one-hour-and-40-minute marathon. That kind of intense physicality is innate.”</p>
<p>The program is divided into three parts, beginning with a trio of solos – Gone (Remembering Where You Came From), Unfold Me, A Few – created by Gagnon.</p>
<p>The mood is inspired by Gagnon’s visit to Spain, where he attended bull fights.</p>
<p>“I use the (bull-fighting) arena image to create a landscape,” Gagnon said. “But I don’t apply the culture of bull fighting directly. I use it as a metaphor. The more we face up to death, the more we can embrace life.”</p>
<p>Then comes a solo by Quebec choreographer Daniel Léveillé, which Gagnon describes as “brutal in its simplicity.” The program ends with a solo by British choreographer and enfant terrible Nigel Charnock, which Gagnon describes as “darkly humorous.”</p>
<p>“The moment (Nigel and I) met, we were like brothers – terrible twins,” Gagnon said. “The solo is a beautiful extrapolation of my life story.”</p>
<p>The Vision Impure is at Usine C, 1345 Lalonde Ave., Wednesday to Nov. 21 at 8 p.m. For ticket information, call 514-521-4493 or go to www.usine-c.com[http://www.usine-c.com].</p>

<p>Name: Louise Bouchard, owner, La Bottine aux Herbes, 3778A St. Denis St., 514-845-1225.</p>
<p>You have so many plants here, how would anyone even know where to begin?</p>
<p>We make suggestions for each person based on their consultation with one of our herbalists. Let's say somebody comes in who has rheumatism - we might make an aromatic mixture of essential oils to massage into their skin, but we would also suggest plants to help the circulation and to clean the blood. By treating the problem externally and internally, we can get more profound results.</p>
<p>What exactly is a herbalist?</p>
<p>A herbalist is a specialist in medicinal plants. We know their properties and know how they interact with other plants and medicines and foods. It takes four years of training to become a herbalist.</p>
<p>How are you different from naturopaths?</p>
<p>Naturopaths are more interested in supplements. They will look at your diet and will be able to suggest vitamins that can help certain problems. A naturopath knows plants, but not as well as a herbalist would. Herbalists know how to identify plants in all their forms and how to transform them into liquid, capsules, plasters and unguents. People say we are like witches, but that's not true. It has been proven by science that these plants work.</p>
<p>Do they?</p>
<p>Yes, of course. People have been using medicinal plants for centuries. Every day we have people who tell us that we have helped them with their problems. They are amazed at how well it works. There was a woman here the other day who had been trying to get pregnant for years. We gave her some plants and six weeks later she was pregnant. She came in and said,</p>
<p>"I don't know if it was you, but I know that I tried everything before and nothing happened."</p>
<p>That's impressive. So what other problems can you cure?</p>
<p>We have had very good results with everything rheumatic, bone and muscular pains, and menstrual pain, too. We also have a lot of success with respiratory problems, problems of insomnia, and even light depression. Problems like constipation and diarrhea also respond very well to natural treatment.</p>
<p>How long does it take to work? Can I drink one of these teas and immediately feel better?</p>
<p>It depends on the problem. Some people have instant results, with others it takes 15 days, or it can take several months. In alternative medicine, we say that it takes one month of treatment for each year that the person has had the illness.</p>
<p>What do you do if somebody comes back to you after several months and they are still not better?</p>
<p>It is rare that a treatment will not work after many months. If it does happen, we may try another treatment, or we will simply refer them to a doctor. We would never insist that somebody continue a natural treatment when it could put them in danger. We are very conscious of our limits. We wouldn't pretend we can help things that we are not capable of helping.</p>
<p>Do doctors ever refer their patients to you?</p>
<p>Some doctors send people here because they see that it works, but it is not that common. Herbology is still relatively new in Quebec. Doctors do not know how conscious and careful we are. It is the dream of herbalists to work in concert with regular medicine so that people have a greater choice when it comes to their health. This H1N1 virus is a perfect example. Modern medicine only gives people one choice, which is to get vaccinated. Why only that? Why is nothing else available?</p>
<p>So what can people do to naturally help prevent the flu?</p>
<p>We have a mixture of essential oils that are antiviral,</p>
<p>antibacterial and antimicrobial. You just put it on your hands and pulse points where the skin is thin. It penetrates into the blood and is a very effective barrier to viruses. We also suggest people do a garlic cure. We have a product that is concentrated garlic that offers excellent flu protection. Most people can safely do this cure; they just have to check with us first, since there are contraindications.</p>
<p>Does it give you bad breath?</p>
<p>It can come out in your sweat if you take a lot, but I think that smelling like garlic is a small price to pay to counteract an epidemic like this.</p>
<p>Do you have anything people can take if they're already sick?</p>
<p>There are many things we can suggest based on the person's symptoms. If they are congested, we can give them plants that will help with that. There are also oils like eucalyptus, which can open the respiratory tracts. Licorice is a great expectorant, which can help clear out the lungs. There is also echinacea, which everybody knows. It will help reduce the intensity of your symptoms. When you already have a cold, all we can do is help reduce the symptoms so you suffer less.</p>
<p>I see you have some medicinal plants that are supposed to be smoked. Can you tell me about those?</p>
<p>Sure, it is very quick and effective to take the plants this way. I know it sounds strange, but there is even a plant that you can smoke to calm a cough. Of course, we understand that smoking can be carcinogenic, so we suggest people smoke these plants only over the short term.</p>
<p>Marijuana is considered a medicinal plant; is it something you would recommend?</p>
<p>There are certain circumstances where it is an efficient treatment, but it is not something we use. It is illegal here in Quebec. Even if we thought it would be good for somebody to take, we cannot sell it. (Laughing) I would be a lot richer if we could!</p>
<p>How have people's attitudes to medicinal plants changed over the years?</p>
<p>When I started this company 15 years ago, it was not that popular. Now I am astonished to see how people are interested in taking care of themselves. They are taking responsibility for their health and looking for different ways to stay healthy. People don't just rush to the doctor right away and take whatever pills he prescribes. That takes a lot of pressure off the entire health system.</p>
<p>What is the weirdest request you have ever had?</p>
<p>It's hard to say. Nothing seems strange to us. There was somebody who wanted a cure for his cow once, but I don't think that is weird. Animals respond well to natural treatment. We get lots of requests for dogs and cats.</p>

</p>
<p>Suddenly, the two-cheek kiss is risky and nobody wants to shake hands. Was that a cough? Stay away!</p>
<p>On the bus and in the métro, there's an early proliferation of winter gloves. At parties, the chip bowl has all but disappeared.</p>
<p>Welcome to the fall social season. Make that the anti-social season.</p>
<p>Weeks into the second wave of the H1N1 pandemic, we all know to cough and sneeze into the crook of our elbows and to stay home if we feel the flu coming on. Everybody's toting Purell.</p>
<p>But the risk of contracting the H1N1 virus is changing the way we interact with friends and strangers in smaller, more imperceptible ways, too.</p>
<p>In transit, at work, at home, in school and at the mall, behaviour that not so long ago might have been called paranoid is now standard.</p>
<p>Co-workers won't share their pens, shoppers swab the cart before doing their groceries and party-goers hold on to their drinks.</p>
<p>Some churches have suspended the handshake, a traditional sharing of the peace at Sunday mass.</p>
<p>School districts in Alberta and several U.S. states are actively discouraging close contact among students. One school in Long Island, N.Y., went as far as banning all touching, including high fives, handshakes and hugs.</p>
<p>In the evening lineup for the 211 bus outside Lionel Groulx métro station, commuters keep their distance. And anyone who uses public transit regularly will have noticed an increase in the number of riders who keep their gloves on inside the bus, train and métro.</p>
<p>It has nothing to do with the weather, said Elise Garneau, who keeps her brown leather gloves on all the way into town on the commuter train from Rigaud - even when her hands start to get sweaty.</p>
<p>"I really don't want to be touching the railings and door handles these days," she explained. "I'm just playing it safe."</p>
<p>Even people who aren't usually germ-obsessed are noticing slight shifts in their everyday behaviours. Secretary Marie Trudeau finds herself pushing open the doors in shopping malls at thigh level. Her rationale: fewer people are touching the door down there, thereby reducing her risk of coming into contact with the H1N1 virus. Others are manoeuvring doors in public places with their hips, their elbows, forearms and derrières - anything but their bare hands.</p>
<p>Another woman found herself walking around the office with both hands in her pockets when she came down with sniffles last week. It was her way of keeping her hands away from her face, thus reducing the spread of contagion.</p>
<p>Nora Choufani halted her Wednesday-night salsa dancing lessons. She wasn't alone; of the 20 or so students enrolled at the start of the class, only eight remain.</p>
<p>"Salsa is very close, and we would be changing partners every 30 seconds. We could easily go through eight partners in a night," said Choufani, a 27-year-old Montreal hydraulic systems engineer who found herself getting out her Purell bottle between dance partners.</p>
<p>"I wondered if it was a good idea, with H1N1, being so close to so many people. I started feeling uncomfortable, so I decided to leave it for now, until things calm down a bit."</p>
<p>A male student at Dawson College reported a rise in the number of washroom users who come in only to wash their hands. When they</p>
<p>exit, they use paper towels to pull open the door.</p>
<p>"There has been a lot of anxiety over H1N1. It's all over the media; everybody is talking about it," observed Rebecca Murray, a Montreal marital and family therapist.</p>
<p>It's hard to avoid, she admitted. Her friends and colleagues, especially those with young children, worry at the first sign of sniffles. They debate whether or not to get the vaccine.</p>
<p>On her way to a seminar at St. Mary's Hospital last Sunday, Murray said, she was stopped at the entrance by a security guard who blocked visitors' entry until they had disinfected their hands at the soap dispenser installed by the door.</p>
<p>"Certainly, people need to be informed about how to protect themselves, but you don't want to cross the line into panic," she said.</p>
<p>All this worrying, said Murray, who works out of the Montreal Therapy Centre at the Queen Elizabeth Health Complex, can create its own set of health problems, among them stress and sleep difficulties.</p>
<p>"In general, it's not healthy to be worrying all the time, to be carrying around a constant sense of dread or panic," she noted. "The answer is to be cautious, but not</p>
<p>hyper-vigilant. Get the vaccine. Wash your hands often. If you are sick, stay home.</p>
<p>"But be careful not to let it take over your life."</p>
<p>Vincent Sheffield, manager of the Monster Gym on Brunswick Blvd. in Dollard des Ormeaux, said H1N1 has pitted the fastidious and the lax against each other. Some members have asked management to post signs outlining H1N1 symptoms as a reminder to people to stay home when they are sick.</p>
<p>"People are more aware of other people's bad habits these days," Sheffield said. "And they are bringing them to our attention."</p>
<p>Members who don't wipe off the fitness equipment are the biggest offenders, he said.</p>
<p>Most people are making extra use of the hand sanitizer dispensers installed around the gym. Ditto for the paper towels and</p>
<p>antibacterial spray near the cardio machines.</p>
<p>Sheffield says many gym users have taken to cleaning the equipment before and after use as an extra precaution.</p>
<p>At the swimming pool at the downtown YMCA last week, a member who had spotted a lifeguard sneezing without covering her mouth called in later asking that the employee be reprimanded.</p>
<p>Gilles Sauvé, a Montreal taxi driver, keeps a can of Lysol disinfectant spray in his glove compartment. If his passengers show any signs of coughing, nose-blowing or sniffling, he gives the car a good blast as soon as they leave.</p>
<p>At the P'tit Terminus daycare centre at Angrignon métro, there's "mass panic" when a case of H1N1 in one of the children is suspected. Last week, 10 of the 62 children who attend the daycare were sent home with a fever. Director Annick Plourde said staff are extra vigilant about washing toys, play surfaces and drinking glasses. Still, many parents are sending their children in with their own, well-labelled water bottles.</p>
<p>"Everybody's being extra cautious, but among the worriers, anxiety is especially heightened," said Plourde, who finds herself pulling down her sleeve when touching the handrails in the métro on the way home from work.</p>
<p>"It used to be that if a child seemed out of sorts, parents would wait and see, hoping to make it through the day. Not anymore. They come right away."</p>
<p>Emile Lagacé, waiting for his lunch at the food court in Place <span class="companylink">Montreal Trust</span>, said he has been bringing his lunch from home more often - except for this day, when he woke up late. He eats at his desk instead of heading out into lunchtime crowds.</p>
<p>It's what experts call "social distancing," a term used to describe practices that reduce contact between people to prevent the spread of diseases. Indeed, the French Health Ministry has recommended against the oh-so-French two-cheek kiss and even the handshake - advice echoed by health officials in Lebanon, the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>"It's not that I want to be paranoid," said Lagacé, as he found himself an out-of-the-way table. "I just don't want to catch anything."</p>
<p>KNOW THE ENEMY</p>
<p>The H1N1 virus and other respiratory infections are spread from person to person.</p>
<p>The virus is transmitted via droplets from the nose and mouth of an infected person when he or she coughs or sneezes. (A sneeze or cough can travel up to a metre.)</p>
<p>Others contract the virus by breathing in these airborne germs or by touching their mouth, nose or eyes after coming into contact with an infected person or a contaminated surface.</p>
<p>The influenza virus can survive for between two and eight hours on such surfaces as doorknobs, handrails, desks and books.</p>
<p>To avoid contact with the virus:</p>
<p>- Try to maintain a distance of two metres (six feet) or more from an infected person; otherwise, keep contacts brief.</p>
<p>- Wash hands often with soap and warm water for at least 15 to 20 seconds, or rub hands with an alcohol-based hand disinfectant, which kills the influenza virus.</p>
<p>- Sneeze and cough into a tissue and throw it away immediately. Or sneeze into the inside of the elbow or upper arm instead of into the hands. Wash hands immediately.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Manners can get out of hand</b>
</div><div>SUSAN SEMENAK    </div>

<div>385 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>H3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>

<p>Suddenly, Nancy Kosik's etiquette classes have gotten more complicated.</p>
<p>The Montreal-based consultant offers workshops in etiquette and protocol for students, business executives and politicians, here and in Ottawa. Among the basics to be mastered is the handshake, the age-old ritual for meeting, greeting, parting, thanking and congratulating.</p>
<p>These days, fears of contracting the H1N1 influenza virus have many people squirming, recoiling, nodding and waving - anything to avoid shaking hands.</p>
<p>Kosik said she understands their concerns. She makes hand-sanitizing dispensers available at all her classes. She keeps miniature bottles in her coat, her purse, in the car and at home.</p>
<p>Kosik said she lauds all the newfound attention being paid to hygiene. But it's bad manners to refuse an extended hand without offering an adequate excuse. And in most situations, a wave or a nod or a fistbump is not an adequate equivalent.</p>
<p>"In so many social and business situations, handshaking is extremely important. It's a way of showing respect, of saying it's a pleasure or an honour to meet you."</p>
<p>Refusing to shake hands, she said, might be construed as a sign of disinterest, insensitivity or discomfort. Indeed, the handshake is such a powerful symbol that the first to proffer his or her hand subconsciously assumes the leadership role in even the briefest interaction, Kosik said.</p>
<p>But what to do if you've been coughing and hacking, or if the other person shows signs of sniffling and snorting, or if you know someone's hygiene is subpar?</p>
<p>Kosik's advice is to acknowledge the non-handshaking right off the bat. Say something like: "I'd love to shake hands, but I think I'm coming down with something. I don't want to put you at risk."</p>
<p>Or try this: "I see you're a little stuffed up and my immune system is a little weak. Sorry if I don't shake hands."</p>
<p>Say it even if it's a little white lie, she counselled. "In proper etiquette, you never make others feel uncomfortable."</p>
<p>But what if it's the boss or an important client and the handshake is unavoidable? Shake hands, then get out the hand sanitizer as soon as you're out of sight.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>An unwinnable choice; Workers without paid sick leave lose pay or risk infecting others</b>
</div><div>Steve Arnold  </div>
<div>The Hamilton Spectator</div>
<div>1347 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>T06</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>Correction published: - 20091118 Incorrect information appeared in a story in Saturday's Spectator concerning paid sick leave days at Tim Hortons Inc. The policy applies only to workers in the corporate head office, not to employees in corporate-operated stores. We apologize for the error. </p>
<p>Jennifer Schaap knew she was too ill to be working in a coffee shop that day. But she had a shot at a full-time job after years of part-time work and welfare and wanted to show she was enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Instead, she alleges in a complaint filed with the Ontario Labour Relations Board that she was fired after collapsing in front of a customer and then going home to let her flu burn itself out.</p>
<p>Schaap is part of an underclass of workers faced with an unwinnable choice -- go to work sick and risk infecting co-workers and customers, or give up a day's pay to stay home and risk not being able to pay their rent.</p>
<p>"Until this happened, I thought I was a good employee. I never got into trouble," Schaap says. "I was trying to show them I really wanted that job."</p>
<p>Yesterday, Tim Hortons offered Schaap her job back. In an e-mail exchange, the doughnut chain's public affairs director, David Morelli, apologized for the misunderstanding, saying the store manager assumed she had walked away from the position when she didn't come back to work immediately.</p>
<p>Schaap says she stayed home because she'd been told not to come back without a doctor's note.</p>
<p>She has decided not to return because of the way she was treated.</p>
<p>Schaap started working for a Hortons store on Concession Street last August. Before the October incident, she'd only missed two days of work because her three-year-old daughter was ill.</p>
<p>Schaap's problem points to what labour activists and others say is a major flaw in employment policy -- about half of Ontario workers don't get paid sick leave.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada studies have shown only about six in 10 working Canadians have paid sick leave. About 77 per cent of unionized workers are covered compared to about 45 per cent of non-unionized staff. In the United States, studies have found about 50 million workers don't have this protection.</p>
<p>Labour and employment lawyer Ed Canning, who writes a column for The Spectator, said Ontario's Employment Standards Act doesn't require employers to offer any paid sick time. They are, however, required to provide up to 10 days of unpaid emergency leave.</p>
<p>"There is nothing in law requiring employers to pay for work that has not been done," he said. "In unionized situations, some kind of coverage can be negotiated, but outside of that there is nothing."</p>
<p>For labour activists, that's a major failure of public policy.</p>
<p>"This is a bigger problem than most people will ever realize," said Wayne Samuelson, president of the Ontario Federation of Labour.</p>
<p>"Especially in the service industries, people don't have sick coverage so you go to work and infect others or go to work healthy and possibly meet someone who's infected.</p>
<p>"People are going to work sick because they have to pay the rent next Thursday or because they're afraid for their jobs," Samuelson added. "It's degrading and demoralizing. There should be some kind of public policy debate about this because in the long run it's going to save us money."</p>
<p>The problem is more intense at the lower end of the wage scale -- statistics from the 2009 annual report of the Hamilton Roundtable for Poverty Reduction found more than 25,000 local workers fall into the category of "working poor" -- they have jobs but can't earn enough to meet basic needs. In Canada, the low-income cut-off for a family of two is $21,224 a year. A person earning $10 an hour would gross $20,800 for a year.</p>
<p>Most of the people in that group are women.</p>
<p>Clare Freeman, executive director of Interval House of Hamilton, endorses the call for some kind of action. Her employees, she said, get 20 days a year of paid sick time, and some staff have been off as much as three weeks this year because of the current H1N1 pandemic.</p>
<p>She suggests using the federal Employment Insurance program to provide some minimum level of coverage for workers in the toughest situations.</p>
<p>"Right now everything is up to the individual employer, and that makes sick time a really contentious issue," she said. "We have to ask what kind of values system do we have as a society. Is work more important than caring for families?"</p>
<p>While they're not forced to by law, some employers do provide a degree of coverage. At Tim Hortons -- where Schaap worked -- employees in corporate-operated stores are allowed six paid days of sick time a year, with short-term disability insurance after that.</p>
<p>Franchisees, however, are left to set their own policies although they can get advice from corporate staff. (Schaap worked at a franchise store.)</p>
<p>Wal-Mart allows full-time employees up to six sick days a year.</p>
<p>"Right now, this issue isn't within the realm of discussion, and if anything is going to change it will have to be a legislative change," says Canning, the employment lawyer. "So far the political will just hasn't been there to do it."</p>
<p>Finding that political will is proving to be difficult, according to Paul Miller, NDP MPP for Hamilton East-Stoney Creek.</p>
<p>It's an issue he knows first-hand. Over the 32 years he was an iron worker at Stelco, "I went in feeling pretty rotten many times because I had three kids and a mortgage to feed."</p>
<p>"If people are sick, they should be allowed to stay home and their employer should pay them for that," he added. "The legislature really hasn't done what it should here."</p>
<p>As a minimum, Miller suggested legislation requiring a single day per month of paid sick time.</p>
<p>But while he can raise the issue as an Opposition MPP, getting real action will require someone on the government side to take up the issue.</p>
<p>"This government is touting Ontario's heath system, so maybe they should be doing something about this," he said.</p>
<p>In the U.S., a bill that's making its way through Congress would require employers with more than 15 workers to provide five sick days a year for workers sent home with contagious conditions such as H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>The issue is also on the political agenda in Alberta, whose Federation of Labour has won agreements from the provincial labour minister to meet on the topic.</p>
<p>Business groups such as the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce oppose such measures, viewing them as unwarranted government interference in private affairs.</p>
<p>Chamber CEO John Dolbec said the agency has not specifically examined the issue, but is generally opposed.</p>
<p>"We just don't believe in undue government interference in private business."</p>
<p>In a health crisis like the current one, Dolbec added, good employers are already giving workers the time off they need, and the bad ones will pay a price in the future.</p>
<p>"In the new economy, the marketplace will dictate that employers without good human resources policies will find themselves without good people," he said. "In this environment, it just doesn't make sense for an employer to be overly punitive."</p>
<p>Schaap is now looking for another job and nursing real anger at a system that left her without basic protection.</p>
<p>"This job was going to be my stepping stone to get off the welfare system and have a better life," she says. "To be fired because you got sick just isn't right."</p>

</p>
<p>A man who offered to sell a vial of H1N1 vaccine to the highest bidder in an online auction has said it was a hoax and turned himself in to police.</p>
<p>Victoria police said the 32-year-old man has apologized and no charges will be laid.</p>
<p>Police also said the man is not a nurse, has no affiliation with the Vancouver Island Health Authority and has no access to vaccine.</p>
<p>The case arose Monday when an ad appeared on usedvictoria.com offering a vial of H1N1 vaccine, containing 10 doses. The ad claimed to be from a registered nurse with an extra vial of vaccine who was prepared to administer it to the highest bidder.</p>
<p>Public health officials immediately filed a police complaint, noting the only known source of H1N1 vaccine in the province was the supply purchased by government for free distribution to the public. Any vaccine offered for sale was likely stolen.</p>
<p>Yesterday, B.C. chief medical health officer Dr. Perry Kendall repeated earlier cautions to anyone considering buying medication over the Internet.</p>
<p>"Buying medical cures over the Internet is not a sensible thing to do," said Kendall. "There are a lot of scams out there."</p>

</div><div>MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>684 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has made a "mess" of the H1N1 vaccination campaign and proceeding with it should be up for debate because its benefits are quickly evaporating, according to one of the country's most vocal chief medical officers.</p>
<p>Dr. Richard Schabas, Ontario's former chief medical officer and a top health officer in the province, said yesterday it might simply be too late for a mass vaccination program to work. He said in an interview that for immunization to be truly effective in preventing a disease, it has to be done before the disease hits.</p>
<p>"As it happened in Canada this year with H1N1, the vaccine didn't come until the outbreak had already started and even now is only coming in relatively small quantities. So an opportunity to really have an impact on the disease, to immunize before the outbreak, is gone," he said.</p>
<p>"In eastern Ontario, where I live and work, the outbreak is effectively over. If we're immunizing people now, essentially you're barring the barn door after the horse is well out the farm gate."</p>
<p>Schabas said outbreaks of the swine flu in populous parts of the country, including southwestern Ontario and British Columbia, are on the wane. "I seriously question the continued focus on mass immunization, at least in those areas," he said.</p>
<p>His views are contrary to those of many of his colleagues - including Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. David Butler-Jones, who says the virus is picking up speed and that immunization will not come too late to slow down the pandemic. Vaccination clinics across the country began on Oct. 26 for groups identified as high-risk and it likely will be a few weeks still before the doors are open to all Canadians.</p>
<p>The lead government department on the pandemic response - the Public Health Agency of Canada, headed by Butler-Jones - should have taken a step back and re-thought its plans for mass immunization, Schabas said.</p>
<p>"If the ground is shifting under our feet, if the disease is happening sooner than we expected and we can't immunize 25 or 30 million Canadians in an efficient manner before the outbreak, let's ask the question very seriously: Is it worth continuing with this? Because I think increasingly the answer is no," Schabas said.</p>
<p>The hype and hysteria around the H1N1 pandemic, the millions of dollars spent so far on responding to it, and the dire warnings about it are all unwarranted, according to Schabas, who questions even the pandemic label.</p>
<p>He spreads the blame among public health officials, governments and the media. The World Health Organization is jokingly referred to as the World Hysteria Organization, he said, and it set a tone in the spring with its messaging that was adopted around the globe.</p>
<p>"They've just been (champing) at the bit waiting for a pandemic for the last 10 years, and I think they dramatically overreacted," said Schabas.</p>
<p>Butler-Jones has heard the criticisms from Schabas and others who feel the risk of the pandemic is overblown. In a news briefing yesterday, he countered by saying "complacency is not warranted."</p>
<p>"Even when we reach the peak, whenever that might come, we still have the other side of the hill to come down, which means millions more potentially infected," said Butler-Jones.</p>
<p>He announced at the briefing that the unadjuvanted vaccine made by <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> for pregnant women now has been approved by Health Canada and can also be used for healthy people age 10 to 64.</p>
<p>He estimated that about 20 per cent of Canada's population has been immunized.</p>
<p>Ontario health officials announced they are joining other provinces in expanding their vaccination priority groups to include children up to 13 years old.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Second wave hitting the island; Kids 5 to 19 can now get shots. It's just beginning but will increase, director of public; What is a pandemic? health agency says</b>
</div><div>CATHERINE SOLYOM   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>1028 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>It's official - the second wave of the swine flu pandemic has hit Montreal, and public health authorities are responding by opening the floodgates of vaccination centres to all 5- to 19-year-olds, a group hit particularly hard by the potentially fatal H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Citing new numbers in Montreal hospitals, Dr. Richard Lessard, the director of Montreal's public health agency, said yesterday the spike in the number of hospitalizations because of acute symptoms is worrisome - with 10 new admissions in the previous 24 hours alone, most in the 10 to 29 age range.</p>
<p>That's compared to 78 hospitalizations in Montreal from Aug. 30 to Nov. 10.</p>
<p>According to the Quebec government, 20 people in the province have died since Aug. 30; it is not known how many were from Montreal.</p>
<p>"Until now, the second wave of swine flu has been (felt) outside of Montreal," Lessard said at a press conference yesterday. "But it's really hitting us now in Montreal. ... What we're beginning to see is an increase in the number of kids in particular being hospitalized, some in intensive care. It's just beginning in Montreal, but we know it will increase."</p>
<p>Starting yesterday, all 15 vaccination centres in Montreal were open to children and youths 5 to 19 years old, as well as the families of children 6 months to 5 years old, and the families of people who are immunosuppressed, groups initially turned away because of a perceived shortage of doses.</p>
<p>In fact, only 15,000 to 20,000 people per day have going to the centres, which Lessard said can inoculate up to 40,000 a day for the next five days, until the 200,000 doses of vaccine in reserve run out.</p>
<p>Public health authorities around the world believe the vaccine - now available with or without an adjuvant, or booster - is the best protection against the virus, though it does take 10 to 14 days before it confers complete immunity.</p>
<p>More vaccine will be coming soon, Lessard said, though he couldn't say how much.</p>
<p>Of particular concern are all those living with chronic diseases in Montreal that make them susceptible to developing a more severe case of the swine flu, Lessard said.</p>
<p>Of an estimated 453,000 people in Montreal living with asthma, heart disease, lung disease, cancer and other chronic ailments, only half have been vaccinated.</p>
<p>"There are many people with chronic illnesses in Montreal and I invite them to get vaccinated before the vaccination begins of thousands of schoolchildren," Lessard said. "By presenting themselves now, they will not have to wait long hours in line and they will be protected sooner from the H1N1 virus."</p>
<p>Quebec health authorities are working on a plan to begin busing schoolchildren to vaccination centres, but no details have been made public yet.</p>
<p>Still off the list of eligible groups, however, are daycare workers and schoolteachers, a paradox Lessard did not wish to address, saying only that priority has been given to those groups most at risk.</p>
<p>For some reason, school-age children are being disproportionately affected by the virus, said Deborah Bonney of the Agence de la santé et des services sociaux de Montréal, which includes the Montreal public health agency.</p>
<p>"All we know is this new virus has a very different profile from the regular seasonal flu that always targeted the elderly," Bonney said. "It's clear from the data that young people are being targeted."</p>
<p>Indeed, 52 per cent of all 923 hospitalizations in Quebec since Aug. 30 have been of individuals who are under 29 years old.</p>
<p>But schools themselves may be contributing to the phenomenon, because of the "density of kids spending all day together," Lessard said.</p>
<p>Also off the list for now are seniors, including those with chronic illnesses. People 65 and over with chronic illnesses will be eligible as of Nov. 30, and all healthy adults over 20 as of Dec. 7.</p>
<p>The good news, Lessard said yesterday, is that it appears that children 3 years old and over will not need a second shot to be fully protected, though the Montreal public health agency is still waiting for its provincial counterparts to issue official guidelines on the subject.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Ignatieff calls in 'Saint Peter' to bail out the Liberals; Veteran adviser should help the party get back on track</b>
</div><div>L. IAN MACDONALD   </div>
<div>freelance</div>
<div>934 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The smartest thing Michael Ignatieff has done in the last six months was to put out a statement on the morrow of last Monday's by-elections, in which the Liberals took a pounding, finishing third in all four of them.</p>
<p>"The by-election results last night show that we have a lot of work ahead of us," Ignatieff's statement read. "Canadians want an alternative to the Harper Conservatives. Our job in the months ahead is to earn the confidence and support of Canadians."</p>
<p>This does not go unnoticed in the Liberal Party, which needed to hear that from Ignatieff. A little humility goes a long way in politics. Or as Ignatieff himself said in the tagline of his TV ads in the Hundred Acre Wood: "We can do better."</p>
<p>One detects the deft touch of Peter Donolo, Iggy's new chief of staff, who begins his new job this week, but has been engaged behind the scenes since he was hired three weeks ago.</p>
<p>Donolo is a communications professional - one of the best. There's a very short list of great communications directors to prime ministers: Dick O'Hagan under Pierre Trudeau, Bill Fox under Brian Mulroney and Donolo under Jean Chrétien. It was Donolo who famously put Chrétien into a jean shirt, and kept him relentlessly on message.</p>
<p>Running "comms" is one thing, running an opposition's office on a war footing might prove to be quite another. The first thing Donolo might want to do is manage expectations around his own arrival, which has been greeted with widespread relief in the party, and inflated expectations by the media. "Saint Peter," as the Globe and Mail dubbed him. Come on. Donolo would be the first to laugh out loud.</p>
<p>The second thing he might want to do is hang out a new sign at the OLO: "Under adult supervision."</p>
<p>That's really what's been most missing in Ignatieff's office, which has been run by frat-house rules by a bunch of Type As from Toronto. Their inexperience has been surpassed only by their ineptitude. With quite a bit of help from Ignatieff himself, they have driven the leader's poll numbers into the basement.</p>
<p>It might prove to Donolo's benefit, and ultimately Ignatieff's, that Liberal fortunes bottomed out last week. Certainly there is no putting a good spin on finishing third everywhere, in English and French, east and west, urban and rural Canada. To his credit, Ignatieff acknowledged as much in his statement.</p>
<p>Ignatieff's problems began when he got no bounce from the Liberal convention, which was transformed into a coronation. Instead of using the opportunity to introduce himself to the country, Ignatieff was content with a partisan acceptance address in which he failed to enunciate a vision of the country and where he wanted to take it. He even forgot to speak about his children.</p>
<p>Then after his June swoon, when he threatened an election in one breath and practically implored Harper to take him off the hook in the next, the first thing his staff should have done was send him out on tour for the summer. Instead, in response to Tory attack ads that Ignatieff was "just visiting," they allowed him to go to London to give the Isaiah Berlin lecture in a tux.</p>
<p>As for his summer tour, it was more like a stately progress, with Ignatieff sightings few and far between across the country, and with absolutely no rationale behind it. What was he doing in Sydney, N.S., one of the safest Liberal ridings in the land?</p>
<p>Finally, there was his "Mr. Harper, your time is up," moment at the Liberal caucus, a speech in which he flayed the PM for not visiting China, and cancelled his own much vaunted visit the very next day. This proved to be only one of many scheduling screw-ups. Ignatieff accepted, and then cancelled, an appearance at the Carr Center at Harvard, of which he was formerly director.</p>
<p>Since the misbegotten moment of Ignatieff threatening an election the country manifestly didn't want, the Liberal poll numbers have collapsed to the mid-20s, just where Stéphane Dion left the Liberals - in a ditch. The worst of the self-inflicted wounds was an entirely avoidable turf battle between Denis Coderre and Martin Cauchon that Ignatieff allowed to degenerate into an English-French and Ontario-Quebec thing, the very two pillars of successive Liberal dynasties, from Laurier's time to the present.</p>
<p>And finally, in the House of Commons, the Liberals have been unable to get any positive traction in the fall session. They've run a series of diversionary tactics - attacking everything from infrastructure spending to the rollout of H1N1, never once neglecting to overplay their hand. The vaccine rollout might not be problem-free, but it is hardly "a national disgrace."</p>
<p>As a comedy of errors, the low point might have come with Donolo's own appointment, at first denied by Iggy's office, only to be confirmed later that night by the leader himself. Welcome to the gang that couldn't shoot straight. For an opposition that would be a government, competence is the basic test. So far Ignatieff has failed on all counts.</p>
<p>But he's a very smart guy, who should be able to learn from his mistakes. Heaven knows, things can only get better from here.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine without additive gets green light</b>
</div><div>Helen Branswell  </div>

<div>491 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>The Hamilton Spectator</div><div>HMSP</div><div>Final</div><div>A09</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Hamilton Spectator.  </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Clinics and doctors across the country were given the green light yesterday to start using 1.8 million doses of H1N1 vaccine made without adjuvant, an additive that makes it work better.</p>
<p>Health Canada approved the GlaxoSmithKline-made vaccine for pregnant women and healthy individuals aged 10 to 64. But the vaccine isn't to be used in people 65 and older, people with impaired immune systems and children under 10, the regulator said.</p>
<p>"Under the age of 10 adjuvanted (vaccine) is clearly preferred and produces much better immunity," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>The GlaxoSmithKline vaccine -- the lion's share of two million doses of unadjuvanted vaccine bought by Canada -- was originally intended for pregnant women and children under age three. The rationale for the special purchase was that there was little if any data on the use of adjuvanted flu vaccine in these groups.</p>
<p>The remainder of the unadjuvanted vaccine was bought from Australian vaccine maker CSL. It was approved earlier and has been offered as of this week.</p>
<p>An estimated 300,000 to 350,000 Canadian women are pregnant in any given year. The rest of the vaccine was destined for young children.</p>
<p>But authorities at the Public Health Agency of Canada have become convinced that any theoretical safety concerns about adjuvants -- which boost the immune response to the vaccine -- are evaporating as the number of people vaccinated with the adjuvanted H1N1 vaccine mount into the tens of millions worldwide.</p>
<p>And with studies suggesting the adjuvanted product induces a stronger immune response in children, the decision was made not to use it in that age group.</p>
<p>"It's pretty clear that the adjuvanted vaccine for children under the age of 10 is clearly superior and is a very good and safe vaccine," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>The decision not to give parents of small children a choice of unadjuvanted vaccine will disappoint some who have concerns about the new adjuvant and have been holding out for the unadjuvanted serum to become available.</p>
<p>Torontonian Rich Cartwright is one. He and his wife would have preferred to give their two-year-old son H1N1 vaccine that was free of the adjuvant and the preservative thimerosal as well.</p>
<p>But in Canada, that's not an option, leaving Cartwright and his wife pondering whether they will give their son the shot or not.</p>
<p>"I think it's just maybe the newness of it," he said of his objection to the adjuvant, an oil-and-water compound that hasn't been used in flu vaccines before in Canada.</p>
<p>Because the additive improves the response to the vaccine, lower doses can be used. In Canada only children six to 35 months and those with chronic health conditions need two pediatric doses.</p>
<p>Healthy children three to nine years only need one pediatric dose.</p>

</p>
<p>A single mother was fired from a local Tim Hortons after staying home from work because she was sick with the flu.</p>
<p>The company says there was a misunderstanding and has offered Jennifer Schaap her job back, but she's no longer interested.</p>
<p>Schaap thought the job would be the key to a better life for herself and her three-year-old daughter. That was in August, when she started working at a Concession Street Hortons store in a part-time job that promised a chance at full-time hours. In October, sick with the flu, she dragged herself to work anyway and collapsed in front of a customer.</p>
<p>"I was standing there and I could hear him, but I couldn't see anything," she said. "Then I went down and couldn't breathe. A supervisor had to take me to emergency."</p>
<p>Told not to come back to work without a doctor's note, Schaap stayed home until she was fired by telephone for not coming to work.</p>
<p>In an e-mail exchange, Tim Hortons public affairs director David Morelli said the whole thing was a misunderstanding.</p>
<p>"Ms Schaap was described as a good employee but when she didn't show up for three shifts over two weeks and never called in, we assumed she wasn't interested in work any longer, like some employees who simply stop showing up," he wrote. "We should have recognized Ms Schaap was likely still ill or recovering. We apologize to Ms Schaap for the misunderstanding."</p>
<p>In a telephone interview, Schaap said, "It doesn't make sense to go back to a place where they treat people like that."</p>
<p>She isn't alone. About half the hourly workers in this province face a wrenching choice when dealing with the H1N1 pandemic: do they stay at home and risk losing pay and opportunities, or go to work and risk infecting co-workers?</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A night in the life of Linden MacIntyre; Though it might not have made the telecast, Canada's Next Top Novelist seized his moment on the stage</b>
</div><div>Shinan Govani    </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>905 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>Toronto</div><div>TO2</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>'I know, I know. I'm pushing the boundaries here, becauseIknow what television is all about."</p>
<p>That was Giller catcher Linden MacIntyre, on Tuesday, standing before a Valhalla's worth of cultural prognosticators, power-peddlers and society sticklers. He'd just been inducted as Canada's Next Top Novelist -- $50,000, thank you very much --and had scooted up to the podium. Being a trained professional in the Toastmaster arts, the Jennings-style gentleman-journo (-turned-author) managed pithy, after which he did suave, after which he slathered on some elegantly shaved bits of public-broadcasting pushing.</p>
<p>Using the CTV live bully pulpit he'd just been given, while the literary likes of Alice Munro and Russell Banks looked on, the author of The Bishop's Man dedicated his win to his day-job brethren. He said, "I can't walk away from this stage without talking about solidarity with ... my colleagues at the CBC. Though the whole media is going through a difficult period, we're going through a particularly [difficult] period, and I wanted to involve them in this."</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, one wouldn't have known that if one was watching the Four Seasons-set book jamboree on TV. Reviewing the show later -- Live! In Canada! The Scotiabank Giller Prize Gala!--I noticed that the CBC rah-rahs had vanished from the telecast. A timing issue, no doubt.</p>
<p>The annual cultural tent-pole event -- which seemed a little smaller this year; just a little less snug (who was left off the list, we wondered?) -- drew an almost-ready-to-levitate per-usual crowd. Rick Mercer, Bob Rae, Barbara Gowdy, Ernie Eves, David Mirvish, Measha Brueggergosman, Graham Greene, Peter C. Newman, Margaret Atwood, Alistair Mac-Leod, Cynthia Dale, Sarah Fulford, David Peterson, Rachelle Lefevre (yeah ... Twilight!), Suzanne Boyd, Michael Cooke, Doug Knight, Noah Richler, Margaret Wente, Diane Francis, Zaib Shaikh, Kim McArthur, Tony Burman, Johanna Schneller, Robert Lantos, Albert Schultz, JohnStackhouse, MichaelOndaatje... and, well, you get the pic.</p>
<p>By evening's end -- after the prize had been handed out, and some people were just beginning to digest the heirloom squash served earlier -- the party, per usual, moved downstairs to the Avenue Bar. There, we saw Linden, the night's conquerer, huddling withhis CBCco-conspirator, Carol Off, as well as his Random House editor Anne Collins. There, we also ran into the publishing house's glamorous Louise Dennys, who managed to convince us that it was a clean sweep for Random House all-around.</p>
<p>She was the night's clear winner for best dressed. "It's Lucian Matis," she told me, as I admired her long, beaded-in-places wasabigreen gown. Besides being Made in Canada -- like the Gillers! -- it was nicely edited (hey, she would know). Not to mention, in a hue just right for inviting envy.</p>
<p>MEANWHILE:</p>
<p>The town's most felon-friendly, hit reality-show chef Marc Thuet was on his way to go "deer-hunting" when we happened to stop in for a not-everyday brunch at his place, Conviction, last Sunday. The potty-mouthed cook let it slip that his Citytv show, about ex-convicts working at his King West sweet spot, is heading to America -- in January! Drops on the Discovery Channel then. And, after that? It's on to the shooting for a confirmed second season. Teases Thuet's long-suffering wife, Biana Zorich, "There's going to be a big twist."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Big Sky's Manitoba hog plants to stay open -</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>

</p>
<p>A large Saskatchewan-based hog production company that sought creditor protection this week vows that its Manitoba operations are not at risk.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms Inc</span>., once a would-be investor in the failed OlyWest pork plant initiative in Winnipeg, said it plans to maintain its two production facilities near Melita and Boissevain.</p>
<p>"Those barns are some of our better-performing units and they're key to our long-term success," said Casey Smit, the company's president and CEO, on Friday. "We intend to keep those two facilities."</p>
<p>Big Sky, the second-largest hog producer in Canada next to Manitoba's Hytek Inc,. applied for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) on Tuesday. It cited the protracted downturn in North American pork prices, exacerbated by fears over H1N1 or "swine flu," as it is referred to in many media reports.</p>
<p>Smit said in an interview from the company's headquarters in Humboldt, Sask., that CCAA protection will give the company time to restructure its financial obligations.</p>
<p>"We'll be working with all of our many stakeholders to position the company for success in the future," he said, adding the company had previously reduced its sow inventory by 18 per cent during the past year and a half.</p>
<p>Big Sky produces 900,000 pigs per year and employs 400 people. It has 600-sow operations in each of the two southwestern Manitoba communities, where it employs a total of about 15 people.</p>
<p>At one point, Big Sky was one of three original partners in the OlyWest hog-kill plant proposed for southeast Winnipeg before withdrawing from the project. The project eventually foundered after the then-Doer government pulled its support.</p>
<p>The market troubles that led Big Sky to seek CCAA protection are affecting more than just Smit's company.</p>
<p>"It's the whole hog industry across North America," he said. "Its an industry-wide issue, basically, and it's really based on several factors with the H1N1 being the latest one."</p>
<p>Smit said higher hog prices would go a long way in assisting the industry right now. Even if a rise in prices doesn't come immediately -- this time of year is typically slower for pork sales -- Smit once again is looking to spring as a time of growth in the market.</p>
<p>"Any pigs that are being produced today for future market needs six months down the road will be sold at a profit, for sure," he said.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan government has a 62 per cent stake in the company and has invested in more than $30 million in Big Sky over the past several years, said government spokesperson Andrew Dinsmore.</p>
<p>The government has no plans to invest any more money into the hog business, Dinsmore said.</p>

<p>IF governments had a crystal ball, politicians would not worry over the next election. People would probably live longer. As it is, no one escapes the vagaries of estimates, guesstimates and probabilities. Nothing illustrates that so perfectly as the imperfect efforts of public health officials to prepare for a global pandemic.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Canadians learned the cost of buying and delivering the H1N1 vaccine had doubled, helping to push the national budget estimates to $1.5 billion. So far.</p>
<p>The news came just as opinion polls found that the tide was turning on the perception of the virus' threat. Early surveys showed that people were lukewarm to the vaccine, regarding H1N1 as a weak adversary. At the end of October, Canadians overwhelmed vaccination clinics when healthy young people died quickly of the flu. By last week, nerves had calmed and opinions had turned again.</p>
<p>Manitoba's H1N1 budget has more than doubled to an estimated $105 million compared to projections in September: Ramping up hospitals to look after the very ill -- adding 61 temporary ICU beds -- will cost $13 million more and, according to the Health department figures, the cost of stockpiling supplies such as masks, gloves and gowns for health care workers has risen by $38 million. The cost of vaccines, though, has not risen, in part because most children probably will not need two doses.</p>
<p>Some people, such as Ontario's former chief medical officer of health, believe the H1N1 preparations are overblown, noting the punch this virus packs is no worse than that of seasonal flu. That will be known when summer returns, but the practical reality of public health is that it must anticipate potential dangers. H1N1 was seen as a novel virus that moved swiftly and held the ability to mutate into something quite lethal.</p>
<p>Seasonal flu kills thousands, mostly the very elderly, every year. The hard truth is that society puts a premium on the lives of the young and healthy, which H1N1 targets. Seasonal flu vaccinations are generally limited in scope and cost less. Canada's defensible decision to inoculate the bulk of the population presaged this fight to be expensive. If the deaths of children and young adults rise steeply as the pandemic hits its peak, people will re-assess the threat of H1N1. The budgeted billions that some decry as overkill may not look so out of proportion.</p>
<p>The post-mortem of H1N1 will hold many lessons: contracting with a single national vaccine producer is risky; forcing children to miss school to line up at a limited number of daytime clinics (pulling parents from work) is disruptive and stressful. More so, the health services for Canadians living on reserves are pathetically inadequate, as is basic infrastructure such as sewer, water and housing. Native people are at highest risk of H1N1 because of these factors, and due to their high rates of obesity and chronic disease.</p>
<p>No government of a developed country would play the odds on a pandemic to save a billion or two. No Canadian government will suffer political fallout for opening the treasury to battle H1N1. The more useful pursuit would aim to fix primitive conditions on reserves that now consign residents to preventable disability and early death. That would hold greater return to the public treasury and it would cut the potential toll of regular and future epidemics.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Drunk driving should lead to chief's suspension, incarceration -</b>

</p>
<p>I haven't been reading the news much lately, but a story about Waywayseecappo Chief Murray Clearsky was hard not to notice. It was unbelievable.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Clearsky went to court for another drunk driving charge, this one stemming from December 2007. It ended up with Clearsky getting a light sentence with no jail time. His lawyer argued successfully that the chief was needed at home on the rez to oversee H1N1 vaccinations.</p>
<p>Wow. What was he going to do exactly that he was needed so badly at home? Hold everyone's hand while they got the shot or chauffeur the ones that didn't have a ride or a vehicle? C'mon now.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe it was so important that he be there -- and hard to believe the judge accepted it too.</p>
<p>The worst part is this wasn't the first time Clearsky had been convicted of a drunken driving charge. He's been charged three times since 1983, and also has a dangerous weapon conviction.</p>
<p>Murray Clearsky has to own up to his problems.</p>
<p>It's embarrassing -- he's taking advantage of his standing in a community and using it to get out of doing jail time for a serious conviction. That's my opinion, and you are welcome to disagree, but first answer me this.</p>
<p>If Clearsky wasn't a chief do you think he would have done some time in jail for three convictions? No doubt about it.</p>
<p>It's time for us to demand better from our leaders.</p>
<p>It used to be a person did some heroic acts on behalf of the people or gave away their last possessions to help someone else and earned the peoples' respect before they were made chief. Sitting Bull would turn over in his grave if he heard about this one.</p>
<p>There are a lot of good chiefs out there, but when Clearsky does stuff like this he makes us all look bad. And speaking about voting isn't there something in the Indian Act that says a chief or councillor position becomes vacant if they are "unfit to continue because he has committed an offence?"</p>
<p>Maybe Clearsky hasn't lost his job because Wawayseecappo residents aren't aware of that?</p>
<p>Or Waywayseecappo might follow its own election code if a majority of the band members ever decided to go that way. Band codes should include a section that severely deals with council members, especially chiefs, who break the law. And those rules need to be enforced.</p>
<p>Bands like Nisichawayasihk Cree Nation have created their own election code that make a criminal record check part of the nomination process. People with a criminal record can't run for office. If an elected chief or a councillor is convicted of an offence then that person is removed and a by-election is held for that job.</p>
<p>Judging by his track record Clearsky has some serious issues with alcohol abuse and that's what needs some attention. He has said he's attended Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and he should continue with that. You don't just go to a few meetings and declare yourself cured of alcoholism.</p>
<p>It's like we're all enabling him when we let him off on something like this. What Clearsky probably needs is an intervention to get him on the path to sobriety.</p>
<p>Drinking and driving is never acceptable. Too many people have died or killed others by making the same stupid mistake. And it's time for people to expect more from our leadership -- the people of Waywayseecappo deserve way better.</p>

</p>
<p>With Ontario now seeing about twice the amount of flu activity than it has in past years, elementary students and seniors with health problems can start getting the H1N1 shot on Monday.</p>
<p>"Our rates of influenza-like illness right now are higher ... than we have seen in any flu season on which we have been doing any monitoring," Ontario's chief medical officer of health, Dr. Arlene King, said Friday. "And the highest burden of illness is in the young."</p>
<p>Currently 135 of 1,000 patient visits to doctors are for flu-like illness, compared to an average 70 to 75 of 1,000 visits going back to the year 2000 during flu season. The vast majority of lab-confirmed cases of flu have been the H1N1 strain.</p>
<p>King made a plea to parents of children 13 and younger to get their shots because they are "highly susceptible to the virus." People under the age of 20 have accounted for almost half of all hospitalized cases of H1N1 in the province.</p>
<p>The priority list has also been opened to those 65 and over with underlying health conditions. It's estimated that 2.4 million of the 12 million people living in Ontario have been inoculated.</p>
<p>There is still no firm date on when healthy adults can get the vaccine.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Health Canada has approved the Canadian version of the vaccine without adjuvant.</p>
<p>Health Canada will make all 1.8 million doses of the adjuvant-free vaccine available to both pregnant women and healthy people between the ages of 10 and 64.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION - School-age children and seniors with serious health conditions are now eligible for H1N1 immunization, leaving only healthy adults to wait.</p>
<p>Region of Waterloo Public Health also reported Friday the region's first confirmed H1N1 death of a man over 50 in the last week. Another death of a man under 50 is being investigated. Both men had chronic conditions.</p>
<p>Public health expanded the priority groups for the H1N1 flu vaccine on Friday when the province announced the next step in its immunization plan.</p>
<p>Children from five to 18 years, as well as seniors 65 and older who suffer from chronic medical conditions are the new groups in the region able to go to their doctor or community clinic to be vaccinated for the H1N1 flu virus - the dominant strain circulating.</p>
<p>On Thursday, firefighters, police and emergency medical services workers were also added to the immunization priority list. The only group not yet eligible for the vaccine is healthy adults. "We're trying to get the vaccine to people who will benefit the most," said regional medical officer Dr. Liana Nolan.</p>
<p>Ontario opened its immunization program beginning next week to children 13 and under, as well as seniors with health conditions. However, Nolan said the region has the capacity to immunize all children and it's logistically simpler.</p>
<p>She estimates it will take three weeks to vaccinate the new group.</p>
<p>Crowds have been dwindling at the last few community clinics as many of the high-risk people were vaccinated. Nolan is hopeful many people will drop in for an H1N1 flu shot with the expanded eligibility.</p>
<p>"We're ready for a lot of people to come out," she said, adding that the region with continue with the numbered wristbands.</p>
<p>The next clinic is Monday afternoon at Kitchener City Hall from 2 to 8 p.m. Public health plans to hold all four clinics scheduled for next week, but they're waiting to confirm the details. An announcement will be made Monday.</p>
<p>Supply is still limited, Nolan said, although another shipment is expected from the province next week. Many doses are going to family doctors, with the majority in the region offering the vaccine to priority patients.</p>
<p>Public health only reports deaths where the H1N1 virus is confirmed with a laboratory test. A 12-year-old Bloomingdale girl died in late October after getting the flu. She was not tested for H1N1, but doctors suspected that strain caused the fatal complications. She had a genetic disorder causing physical and mental disabilities.</p>
<p>Most H1N1 cases are mild to moderate, Nolan said, and the death rate for H1N1 remains below that of the regular seasonal flu. The majority of deaths occur in people with underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>Priority groups now include:</p>
<p>all children from six months to under 19 years;</p>
<p>people 19 and older with chronic medical conditions;</p>
<p>health care workers including first responders;</p>
<p>pregnant women; household contacts and caregivers for people at high risk who cannot be immunized (children under six months) or may not respond to vaccines (people who are immune compromised).</p>
<p>People suffering from the flu can go to two flu assessment clinics in Kitchener and Waterloo. Cambridge Memorial Hospital's clinic opened on Friday and is running for five days until Tuesday. Grand River Hospital's opened on Tuesday for two weeks.</p>
<p>The assessment clinics are for people who don't feel well enough to care for themselves at home or can't go to a family doctor.</p>
<p>People will be assessed for the severity of their illness and given information and advice for treatment at home.</p>
<p>Vaccines will not be offered at the clinics and only patients with flu-like illness will be seen. People experiencing serious complications, such as difficulty breathing, should go to an emergency department.</p>
<p>The assessment clinic at Cambridge Memorial runs from 3 to 8 p.m. at the back of the ambulatory care centre until Tuesday, Nov. 17. Days may be added if there's a need.</p>
<p>Grand River's assessment clinic is open Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. until Tues., Nov. 24.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The local public health board on Friday expanded the list of priority people eligible for pandemic H1N1 flu vaccination.</p>
<p>Up to this point, priority was given to pregnant women, people under 65 with chronic medical conditions, health care workers and certain caregivers.</p>
<p>It was expanded yesterday to include school children, people 65 and older with chronic conditions and emergency services workers like police, firefighters, correctional officers and other emergency first responders.</p>
<p>At a press conference Friday, chief medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer appealed to healthy individuals 19 years of age and older to respectfully await future inoculations as these priority groups are given shots from a still-limited supply of vaccines.</p>
<p>"We ask that you have some patience," Mercer said.</p>
<p>"Currently, there is a provincial shortage of vaccine," Mercer said at the press conference, adding she's hopeful those supplies will be replenished in the near future and everyone above 18 can ultimately get inoculated.</p>
<p>"We've asked for additional doses."</p>
<p>Mercer said supplies have been particularly limited in the Dufferin area, but it hasn't been a crisis.</p>
<p>"We've never run out," Mercer stressed.</p>
<p>In addition to regular clinics, additional vaccine injection sites have been set up for the next week, to immunize elementary school children. That will be followed with a week of clinics at high schools for older school children.</p>
<p>Mercer was speaking Friday from the health board's headquarters in Guelph to local reporters, as well as by video conference to journalists in Fergus and Orangeville.</p>
<p>Asked why shots weren't being given at all elementary schools, Mercer said that was a logistical nightmare consuming too much time and resources when the need is to immunize as many people as possible in as short a time frame. There are 46 elementary schools in Guelph alone, she said.</p>
<p>"It was just a very challenging logistical model."</p>
<p>The health board's been scrambling for weeks to try to provide as much health protection as possible in a fluid and complex flu season.</p>
<p>"It's been a very active time, the last couple months," health board communications manager Jan Craig said.</p>
<p>Mercer added: "This has been a very challenging process for us." It's been fraught with "large unknowns" like the availability of doses and the best target populations to inoculate in an area population of 274,000.</p>
<p>To date, her health board has administered almost 12,000 shots. Another almost 3,200 doses have been distributed to hospitals, 19,000 to community physicians and almost 4,000 doses to others. Currently, 131 primary care doctors are inoculating their patients.</p>
<p>Free and voluntary flu clinics continue at College Avenue Public School in Guelph and 855 David St. N., in Fergus, 276A Broadway Ave. in Orangeville and the Mel Lloyd Centre in Shelburne, as well as other satellite locations on certain days. Detailed information is on the board's website; www.wdghu.org[http://www.wdghu.org]. The flu hotline is 1-800-265-7293, ext. 4161.</p>
<p>Over the next little while, satellite community sites will operate in Rockwood, Erin, Mount Forest, Grand Valley, Palmerston, Arthur, Harriston and Drayton on a limited basis. To reach the maximum school children and accompanying parents, hours have been extended into the evening, Mercer noted. Some children may require two doses, at least three weeks apart, for maximum protection, she added.</p>
<p>Dates for school children include the scheduled school professional development day Nov. 20.</p>
<p>On the week of Nov. 23, clinics are planned for secondary schools.</p>

<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Three people have died from influenza in the wider Guelph area to date this year, Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health reported late Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Two deaths were from pandemic H1N1 and the third from seasonal flu.</p>
<p>In total, 16 people were hospitalized for lab-conformed flu, including one of the three people who died, public health board communications specialist Lucia Zdeb said.</p>
<p>The pandemic H1N1 cases relate to the death of a man visiting Orangeville from the United States in June, the first such H1N1 fatality this year in the health board's area.</p>
<p>The second was a man from North Bay visiting his mother in Guelph slightly more than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Zdeb said a person also succumbed to seasonal flu some time since April, but added public health was unable to provide any further details.</p>
<p>Her board noted six of the hospitalizations were for seasonal flu and 10 for the H1N1 strain.</p>

<p>No matter how hard you work, how much you accomplish and how stable and secure you feel in your job, sooner or later you can expect something truly horrible to happen, career-wise. I’m not talking about a minor setback like a massive product recall, a little insider trading probe or a leaked report about how your executives jumped the H1N1 flu vaccination line. I’m talking about really horrible stuff, like being sent away on a business conference.</p>
<p>Business conference can range from painful, boring one-day workshops to painful, boring week-long-or-longer workshops.</p>
<p>If you get to spend a few days away on a business trip, prepare to be pampered. Everything is better in a hotel, even the bottled water. How do I know? Because it costs $5.50 and you’d have to be crazy to pay that if it wasn’t way better than the stuff you can get from the tap right beside the water bottle.</p>
<p>The soap too is so much better than any soap you’d find out in the real world. Sure, my soap at home smells like a mountain glacier tropical mist ocean surf fusion but it can’t compare with hotel soap. In hotels I’ve stayed at recently, the soap flavours couldn’t be described in one or two words. Each little bar has its own story. At the Crowne Plaza in Ottawa the soap is "a warm blend of sparkling bergamot and fresh ginger. Clean musk notes of white tea amid spicy nuances of vetiver and nutmeg."</p>
<p>The restaurant menu had nothing that sounded any tastier than my soap, which isn’t even called soap; it’s called a "cleansing bath bar."</p>
<p>At the Hilton, my soap actually had "soap" in its name. It’s called "Moisturizing Soap with Shea Butter."</p>
<p>The back of the package has far more detail and it’s a good thing too because I need more than just soap. I need a story too. This soap story is several paragraphs but to condense it, the soap is "triple-milled" (I don’t much care for quadruple-milled myself) and it’s "fine lathering" and "non-drying."</p>
<p>The thing about all these descriptions on my soap is . . . I don’t know what any of it means. Vetiver and bergamot? Whatever happened to plain old soap, when the only thing fancy about it might be that it came in the shape of a seashell? What is shea butter? Do I need a hint of nutmeg? Do the people who made this soap have any idea what I plan to do with it?</p>
<p>Well, once you get yourself cleaned up at the hotel, it will be time to head off to your conference or workshop or whatever other business brought you here. And sometime during the course of the event, you are very likely to encounter a motivational speaker.</p>
<p>A business conference wouldn’t really be a business conference without a keynote address by someone whose goal is to inspire and energize everyone in the room in that narrow window of time while they finish their cheesecake but before their thoughts drift to their fantasy football team, dinner plans or whether they remembered to record The Vampire Diaries.</p>
<p>Motivational speakers utilize a wide variety of styles to deliver their messages - everything from obnoxious to annoying. Some motivational speakers are terrible but then there are some who are merely bad.</p>
<p>I’m kidding. Of course there are some good motivational speakers. Oh, their speeches are still bad but at least they’re brief.</p>
<p>So how does your motivational speaker rate? How bad is bad? Here are some things to look for.</p>
<p>You’re forced to do something stupid.</p>
<p>OK, you know the speaker is a tool. But does everyone else in the audience? You can never tell because most audiences at these things are, as a rule, politely trying to stay awake. They’re hard to read. So when your motivational speaker makes you do something stupid like twirl your finger in the air to "warm it up" then point it at your nose to "focus on the power within" everyone in the audience does it over fears that everyone else in the audience is totally into the message. Here’s a tip. They’re not. If your speaker insists on making you do something stupid, it’s OK to say no.</p>
<p>MLK or Hitler?</p>
<p>You know you have a bad motivational speaker when his PowerPoint slide show features Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and/or the phrase "I Have a Dream."</p>
<p>"You have a dream," he’ll tell you. "You have a dream to increase sales by 1.5 per cent in Q3. Well, someone else had a dream."</p>
<p>Cue the slide of MLK.</p>
<p>On the other hand, your speaker may attempt to embolden you by telling you that you must speak out against those who would criticize your business because if you let that environmentalist continually hammer your company for dumping toxic waste into a stream, well, you might as well be living in Nazi Germany.</p>
<p>Some speakers also bring a more modern context. For example, they’ll tell you that Barack Obama won the White House basically because of Twitter (conveniently his main message is that if you want to reach a wider audience with your business message, start Twittering and Facebooking). And hey, who wouldn’t want constant Tweets and status updates about your metal fabricating or storm water engineering?</p>
<p>At this point in the presentation, you might want to excuse yourself and take a walk. Use an excuse if you need to. Say you have a pressing vetiver issue that needs your immediate bergamot.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Cold, flu germs tend to be hardy, so keep washing</b>
</div><div>Reena Nerbas   </div>

<p>Q: How long do flu germs live outside the body?</p>
<p>Simon</p>
<p>A: According to the <span class="companylink">Mayo Clinic</span>, the length of time that cold or flu germs can survive outside the body on a hard surface, such as a doorknob, varies greatly. But the suspected range is from a few seconds to 48 hours -- depending on the specific virus and the type of surface.</p>
<p>Flu viruses tend to live longer on surfaces than cold viruses do. Also, it's generally believed that cold and flu viruses live longer on non-porous surfaces -- such as plastic, metal or wood -- than they do on porous surfaces -- such as fabrics, skin or paper.</p>
<p>Although cold and flu viruses primarily spread from person-to-person contact, you can also become infected from contact with contaminated surfaces. The best way to avoid becoming infected with a cold or flu is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or with an alcohol-based sanitizer.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website says the H1N1 virus can survive and infect a person for two to eight hours after being left on a surface.</p>
<p>Q: What is the best way to clean piano or organ keys?</p>
<p>Darlene</p>
<p>A: For general cleaning on plastic or ivory keys, use vinegar and water on a soft cloth. For ivory keys, wipe with non-gel, non-bleach toothpaste on a damp cloth. Ensure that you rub gently and do not scrub. Rinse with fresh milk and buff well. Note: Over time and with repeated cleaning, the yellow on your ivory keys can be significantly reduced. Whitening your ivory piano keys takes a long time and a great deal of patience.</p>
<p>Extra tidbit: If you are unsure whether your piano keys are plastic or ivory, note that piano keys that have ivory tops are made in two parts. If you look carefully you will see where they join. Also, ivory piano keys are off-white instead of stark white. Lastly, ivory has a grain. Modern pianos have plastic keys which do not have any grain. Be careful not to confuse ivory keys with cellulose keys -- cellulose also has a grain, but the cellulose grain is more even than ivory.</p>
<p>Q: We have a 102-year-old Christening gown made of white cotton and lace which has been in storage for the past seven years. We now find that it has a yellow stain, probably from milk, on the front of the cotton. Because of the age of the gown, we were reluctant to tackle the stain without some professional advice.</p>
<p>Can you suggest a safe way to remove the stain without harming the fabric please?</p>
<p>Sharon</p>
<p>A: You always want to begin with the mildest solution and use more aggressive solutions only if necessary. With this in mind, make a liquid paste of borax (or washing soda) and water. Cover the milk stain. Leave overnight and rinse in the morning. Keep me posted.</p>
<p>Dear Readers,</p>
<p>I must share with you my dishwasher experience. Last week my dishwasher stopped working right in the middle of a wash. It could not even muster up enough breath to complete the cycle. After asking the manufacturer, I was told that the dishwasher has been recalled for this exact reason (it just suddenly stops working). The dishwasher was going to be fixed at no charge within three to four weeks. Well, after two days I opened up the dishwasher and the smell punched me in the face and nearly knocked me down. I poured half a bottle of vinegar onto the floor of the dishwasher and sprinkled baking soda on top. The smell is gone and I can now breathe with a smile.</p>
<p>Fabulous tips for organizing plastic containers:</p>
<p>Recently I spoke to a teacher about her challenge to transform her school lunchtime into a no-waste program. In order to achieve this, one must keep a collection of plastic containers on hand.</p>
<p>- To store plastic storage bases and lids, they need to remain highly visible and easy to reach. One of the best ways to do this in standard kitchen cupboards is to install a simple pullout drawer to get a bird's-eye view of the supply.</p>
<p>- Store lids on containers, and stack them instead of nesting them together. That way they are always paired up.</p>
<p>- Purchase plastic containers with attached lids.</p>
<p>- Instead of a huge assortment of sizes, keep as many identical plastic containers as possible.</p>
<p>- Recycle old dish strainers. They hold lids (small in front to largest in the back). The cutlery bucket holds plastic forks and spoons that can be washed and reused for work or school lunches.</p>
<p>- Number the lids and containers that match. For example, all of one size containers would be labelled with 1's and the matching lids would be labelled with 1's. When searching in your drawer you can immediately spot the lid that fits.</p>
<p>Outstanding tips of the week:</p>
<p>- I don't know what I'd do without nylon net -- there are so many uses for it. I tuck it in where I am likely to find spiders (around doors, the space between outside walls and concrete steps). I also secure netting inside heat vents with a rubber band and put netting between sliding windows that have drainage holes and overtop of open pipes, etc. I also fold netting over the blades of my knives to prevent accidental cuts.</p>
<p>Erna</p>
<p>- Adding a teaspoon of instant coffee granules or cocoa per two cups gravy enriches the flavour and adds colour.</p>
<p>- Cooked meat stores and freezes better in its gravy. The gravy keeps the meat from drying out.</p>
<p>- Cornstarch has twice the thickening power of flour.</p>
<p>- Instant mashed potato flakes will work as a thickener for gravy and produce no lumps. You may need extra salt.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Strong words for Karzai; Canada pressures Afghan leader</b>
</div><div>MATTHEW FISHER   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>312 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A21</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Canada was putting pressure on President Hamid Karzai to address corruption and to extend his government's reach after a "flawed election" that was "not pretty by any stretch of the imagination," Defence Minister Peter MacKay said yesterday at the end of four-day visit with troops in the war-ravaged south.</p>
<p>"What we need is a reliable partner. I believe that that message has been sent clearly to the president in Kabul and to his advisers," MacKay said. "I think President Karzai is very aware that the eyes of the world are upon him."</p>
<p>The August election was plagued by charges of fraud and ballot stuffing. It remained unresolved until this month, when Karzai was declared elected for another term.</p>
<p>The minister confirmed a decision announced in Ottawa this week that insurgents held by Canada in Kandahar would not receive the H1N1 vaccine, contrary to reports made by Canadian medical staff in the field.</p>
<p>"Clearly we have responsibilities and international obligations when it comes to the treatment of detainees, but look, we are moving forward to vaccinate Canadian soldiers and Canadian citizens. That is the priority. There is no plan to vaccinate detainees," MacKay said.</p>
<p>MacKay also commented on the pullout of Canadian troops from Afghanistan in 2011. He said there was nothing unusual in remarks made recently by Canada's top general, Walter Natynczyk, that the military had begun to draw up plans to withdraw forces from Afghanistan.</p>
<p>"General Natynczyk was expressing what we all understand was an instruction of Parliament that was agreed upon by a majority of parliamentarians," the defence minister said.</p>
<p>"We cannot be in Afghanistan fighting to preserve and protect democracy and not respect our own."</p>
<p>Travelling with MacKay to Afghanistan were Industry Minister Tony Clement and Senator Pamela Wallin.</p>

<p>As the second wave of the swine flu pandemic hits Montreal and there's a spike in the number of hospitalizations, with 10 new admissions in only 24 hours, public health authorities open vaccination centres to all 5- to 19-year-olds, a group hit hard by the H1N1 virus.

</p>
<p>Re: The H1N1 controversy.</p>
<p>The human condition dictates that there always will be individuals or groups who deem themselves more worthy of treatments or services ahead of the general population, and who therefore will "jump the queue" as the much recently quoted phrase denotes. So be it.</p>
<p>These people deserve our disdain, but we must forget their transgressions and press on relentlessly despite their inconsideration.</p>
<p>Let us focus rather on the positives. The WHO declared an H1N1 pandemic in June 2009 - five months ago - thus requiring all nations to prepare for a crisis. The pharmaceutical GlaxoSmithKlein was required to fast-track production of the necessary vaccine to protect the population in almost record time. Information had to be conveyed to an unsuspecting world population, and plans had to be enacted to vaccinate people in an orderly and priority-directed fashion.</p>
<p>Did our authorities succeed ? I believe they did and so did GSK in its manufacturing accomplishment. We are all human. Glitches have occurred and tempers have flared, but the vaccination process has proceeded nonetheless with better success than in most other countries. Yes, the West Island should have had two vaccination centres, and, yes, the coupon /ticket system should have been implemented from the beginning. But these are lessons learned, to be used the next time.</p>
<p>Let's thank the people manning the clinics and working those long hours and the authorities involved such as Dr. David Butler-Jones and Dr. Alain Poirier. They deserve our respect and congratulations on a job well done. We and our families have been well served by them.</p>

</p>
<p>I've been fighting a cold for some days now, fighting it with OJ and hot tea, with vitamin C and taking it easy. As usual, the cold is winning.</p>
<p>In a departure from the usual, though, I'm mad about this cold. Mad at the red-nosed woman in the seat behind me on the train from Ottawa to Montreal last week, who took time out from coughing her way through the two-hour trip only to blow her nose as she tapped away at her laptop.</p>
<p>Mad at the waiter in the hotel breakfast room in Ottawa who sneezed all over the coffee station. Mad at the girl sitting to my left on a jammed airplane the week before for wiping her dripping nose with her sleeve all the way down to Orlando. And mad at colleagues who don't think that coughing up mucus is something they should do in the privacy of their own homes.</p>
<p>I never used to feel this aggressive toward people for being out and about with their cold or flu viruses. But I've been laid low too often by what I take to be a complete absence of consideration on their part.</p>
<p>And the reporting these past months about the H1N1 pandemic, I confess, has turned me into a more frightened, cautious version of myself. I envision germs dispersing through the droplets in people's sneezes and coughs and wish I could duck them. I wash my hands so often the skin is raw, use alcohol-based sanitizer furiously and keep my hands away from my face to try to keep germs from spreading. An e-mail on H1N1 prevention making the rounds counsels twice-daily gargles with warm salt water, and I can't see the harm in that. Before too long, I expect to have the H1N1 shot.</p>
<p>I get that people think others depend on them and that they have to turn up at work even when they're sick. But I believe that they're wrong, that they'd be surprised by the length of the list of co-workers who, like me, would prefer that they stayed home.</p>
<p>Some people don't have paid sick days, I know, or are afraid of losing their jobs if they don't report for work. Seems to me that going to work with a plugged head and taking on the risk of getting even sicker or infecting those around you is pretty shortsighted. Still, bills and fear are powerful motivators; if I were in either of those camps, I confess I might consider working sick, too.</p>
<p>Yet many who choose to go into work even when they're under the weather are people whose jobs are in no danger, people who would be paid, anyway. Recent surveys have shown many people say they frequently go to work when they feel sick. Results of a poll made public this month, for instance, show that more than 25 per cent of Quebecers surveyed said they would continue to go to work if they had the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>Andrew Simor, head of microbiology and infectious diseases at the Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, said the poll illustrates a workplace culture that rewards a work-at-all-costs attitude --and discourages people from taking sick time.</p>
<p>"I don't think organizations as a whole have done an awful lot to emphasize the importance of the healthy workplace-- quite the opposite," he said. "The history and the culture we have is that you're a bit of a wimp if you take time off from work because you're sick....In light of the pandemic, I think people should be re-thinking that."</p>
<p>Full disclosure: I used to be one of those people. I thought staying home was a sign of weakness, believed there was something commendable about going to work even though I really wanted to be at home, under a blanket, drinking hot tea with honey. An exaggerated sense of obligation, prompted, perhaps, by an inflated perception of my value to the organization, was one reason, I suspect; as well, I was reluctant to take into account the potential effect of my actions on others in my sphere.</p>
<p>No longer. I see clearly now that we're not nearly as productive when we work sick, that there's a better-than-good chance we'll set into motion a cycle that risks making the people around us ill. And generous as I like to think I am as a person, I'm thinking nobody wants me to be generous with my germs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 was last straw for bankrupt hog producer</b>
</div><div>Cassandra Kyle   </div>
<div>Saskatoon Star Phoenix; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>463 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>E6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>At this time last year, Casey Smit and his colleagues at <span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms Inc</span>. were looking ahead to spring 2009 as a time of recovery in the hog market.</p>
<p>But when the season of renewal came around, hog prices didn't rise. A few months later, H1N1--swine flu--hit and prices fell even lower.</p>
<p>In the summertime, said CEO Smit, hogs that were expected to sell 30-to 50-per-cent higher than usual didn't hit the mark.</p>
<p>The flu crisis only extended an ongoing downturn in the pork market, he explained, forcing the company --Saskatchewan's largest hog producer, based in Humboldt--to file for creditor protection in the past week after 24 months of struggles.</p>
<p>"Feed costs had come down, markets were supportive of the hog industry and we were going to see profitable pricing come summer 2009," Smit said. "When H1N1 hit the news, certainly the impact on the named reference to the swine industry, or to the hog industry, was devastating.</p>
<p>"After it became quite evident that H1N1 did not come from pigs, the damage was already done."</p>
<p>The company's application for protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act (CCAA) will give its executives time to meet with advisers and stakeholders and form a restructuring plan, Smit said.</p>
<p>For now, operations will continue as usual for Big Sky's 400 employees at the company's 40 facilities in Saskatchewan and Manitoba.</p>
<p>"Our immediate concern is that our pigs are fed and cared for, our employees...are at work and have confidence in the company, and we continue to operate," he said.</p>
<p>The market troubles that led Big Sky to seek CCAA protection are affecting more than just Smit's company, which delivers more than 900,000 animals to North American markets every year--a figure the CEO still expects to meet this year.</p>
<p>"It's the whole hog industry across North America," he said. "It's an industry-wide issue, basically, and it's really based on several factors, with the H1N1 being the latest one."</p>
<p>Smit said higher hog prices would go a long way to help the industry right now. Even if that doesn't happen immediately--this time of year is typically slower for pork sales-- Smit again is looking to spring as a time of growth in the market.</p>
<p>"Any pigs that are being produced today for future market needs six months down the road will be sold at a profit, for sure," he said.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan government has a 62-per-cent stake in the company and has invested in more than $30 million in Big Sky over the past several years.</p>

<p>Re:Our most effective foreign aid; Yet lifesaving vaccines remain out of reach for millions of children, The Journal, Nov. 12.</p>
<p>Canadians have the luxury of debating whether or not to get the H1N1 vaccine, among others, for themselves and their children. But this is a choice 24 million children worldwide do not have.</p>
<p>In fact they have no access to immunizations that prevent diseases most of us have never even experienced like tetanus.</p>
<p>The Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) is considering cancelling the Canadian International Immunization Initiative (CIII), one of the most-effective foreign aid initiatives ever.</p>
<p>Every Canadian will have access to the H1N1 vaccine. If CIDA renews funding for CIII, every child could have access to childhood immunizations.</p>

<p>A young girl from central Alberta has become the first child with swine flu to die in this province, Alberta health officials reported Friday. The girl's death, along with three other fatalities reported Friday, push Alberta's flu-related death toll to 38 since the outbreak began, including 18 in the past week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu pandemic highlights sick-leave challenges; Firms try to plan for absenteeism, workers struggle with staying home</b>
</div><div>Wailin Wong   </div>
<div>Chicago Tribune</div>
<div>612 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>H5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>For under-the-weather workers, the decision to stay home or push through a day at the office has always been a hand-wringing one. Now, concerns over H1N1 flu, coupled with a lean economy, are putting workers' sick-leave dilemmas under the microscope.</p>
<p>"Since the recession started . . . it's been a more heated issue of workers really having to protect their jobs and needing to make sure they're in the office," said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of The LaSalle Network, a recruiting and staffing firm. H1N1 means that "more than ever, employers are saying now, 'If you're sick, don't come in, because it's so contagious.'"</p>
<p>While many businesses might not be changing their official sick-leave policies, they are taking steps to deal with H1N1, also known as the swine flu, and potential absenteeism.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control recommends that those with flu-like symptoms stay home for at least 24 hours after their fever is gone. This means some workers could be out for an entire week or more, putting a strain on the business and the worker.</p>
<p>Some employees have to ration their sick days carefully or may not have any paid time off. Others weigh the fear of making a bad impression against the risk of prolonging an illness and feeling worse.</p>
<p>"It's very hard to take off of work at my job," said Noor Aweidah, who works for the president of a marketing firm and helps bring in new clients. "Things being the way they are today, new business is a real priority. If I'm not there, meetings are not happening, calls are not taking place."</p>
<p>Even with her concerns, Aweidah recently had to take a rare day off to keep some incipient flu-like symptoms from worsening. She cancelled a client meeting and made sure the interns under her supervision knew their daily tasks, then lay down on her couch to watch bad movies and drink tea.</p>
<p>The client was understanding about needing to reschedule, she said. "It's hard being in a creative environment to not be on your A game, especially when you're interfacing with clients," Aweidah said. "But they don't want to meet with someone who's coughing or sweating."</p>
<p>Managers also have to balance taking care of their workers with keeping their offices staffed.</p>
<p>In September, Harvard School of Public Health published the results of a national survey showing that only one-third of businesses believed they could avoid "severe operational problems" for two weeks if H1N1 felled half of their workforce. The figure dropped to 22 per cent for businesses believing they could avoid serious issues for a month.</p>
<p>Gimbel said absenteeism has been contained so far. For employees who are fretting about missing work because of their own illness, or that of a child or elderly parent, the key is "reassuring your boss that the work you're supposed to be doing is still getting done," Gimbel said.</p>
<p>Companies also are thinking about contingency plans.</p>
<p>"We continue to engage in conversations about what would happen if we got one swine flu case or five," said Aggie Hellyer, human resources manager at Planmeca, a dental equipment manufacturer that has roughly half of its 85 employees in the office regularly.</p>
<p>"You have to make the business survive on limited resources. But we're pretty well-prepared."</p>

<p>Copper looks great, fights germs</p>
<p>Sinks - Hammered copper sinks and copper hardware have become popular design choices in homes. Now, recent studies are indicating that copper might be a healthy choice as well.</p>
<p>Earlier this year the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced that copper has antimicrobial properties, capable of killing bacteria as well as viruses (but this doesn't mean a copper sink will protect you from the H1N1 flu).</p>
<p>"A copper sink is not a substitute for good hygienic practices, but it's nice to know that the copper surface actually has a role in disinfecting your sink," said Naomi Howard, president of Native Trails (a company that makes hand-hammered copper sinks and tubs) in a news release. Native Trails copper sinks are available in Calgary at Royal Flush, Wolseley and Cronkhite Supply.</p>

</p>
<p>The death of a 38-year-old University of Ottawa professor, who had no known underlying medical condition when he succumbed to the H1N1 flu this week, highlights a medical mystery that continues to dog researchers: Why does a tiny minority of otherwise healthy young Canadians become gravely ill or die from swine flu?</p>
<p>Why does the novel virus seem to behave differently from seasonal flu strains, which are typically more fatal to the old and ailing?</p>
<p>While experts have theories, they have so far not produced hard scientific evidence that points to clear answers.</p>
<p>Even so, the death of Keith Fagnou, a doting father and budding chemistry star, underscores what scientists know about the pandemic virus' worst cases to date -- that H1N1 disproportionately hits the young.</p>
<p>Fagnou died Wednesday in the The Ottawa Hospital's intensive care unit three days after he was admitted. The first sign of illness his colleagues noticed was last Friday, when he sounded hoarse and said he was losing his voice. If that's the case, Fagnou's condition appears to have deteriorated at alarming speed.</p>
<p>"He complained that he had a sore throat," said Deryn Fogg, one of Fagnou's chemistry colleagues. "I had a meeting with him that morning, and think he might have gone home afterward. But he was working on, I think, a research proposal over the weekend."</p>
<p>According to case reports from intensive care units across Canada and around the world, half of patients who have become critically ill have been under the age of 40, with the other half being older.</p>
<p>Even more significant, doctors say, is that the virus can cause serious disease in previously healthy people, which does not fit the typical patterns of flu.</p>
<p>"That's novel," Dr. Robert Fowler, a University of Toronto medical professor said in a recent interview. "It makes it difficult, therefore, to define a segment of the population that is so-called high risk."</p>
<p>Experts suspect people over 65 have some immunity to the pandemic virus, because they were likely exposed to a distant cousin of H1N1 that circulated in the 1950s.</p>
<p>Other researchers have speculated that during the 1918 flu pandemic, young, healthy people became very ill because they have strong immune systems, and their immune response to infection kicked into overdrive, leading to more inflammation and severe disease.</p>
<p>While scientists are still trying to learn more about what predicts severe illness in people with H1N1, how the virus attacks and kills is better known. Seasonal flu viruses tend to infect the upper respiratory tract, particularly the cells lining the main airway and nasal tract. What makes H1N1 different is that while it also infects the upper airways, in some people, it penetrates deeper down, infecting the lungs with frightening speed and effectively drowning them. "There's an overwhelming amount of fluid that goes into the lungs," said Dr. Isra Levy, Ottawa's medical officer of health.</p>
<p>In other people, said Levy, the virus inflames of the cardiac muscle, which can cause sudden heart failure. Still others are so weakened by the virus that they develop secondary bacterial infections, which can lead to fatal pneumonia, said Levy.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, family and colleagues paid tribute to Fagnou, praising him for his modest temperament and extraordinary abilities as a teacher and researcher. "He was one of the stars of his generation," Fogg said.</p>
<p>As such, Fagnou had an unusually large group of students in his lab -- 19, of whom 14 were grad students. On Friday, university officials were meeting with the students, to ensure that they won't be abandoned. Grad students, in particular, depend on a close relationship with a professor who guides their work.</p>
<p>Fogg said Fagnou's most high-impact research lay in his invention of "a powerful, very imaginative new way to assemble the carbon frameworks of molecules important in a whole range of contexts."</p>
<p>"What he was doing was changing how chemists think about carbon-carbon bonds," she said.</p>
<p>"That is the carbon skeleton of most of the molecules that you think about," she said -- anything from drugs to "fine" chemicals used in products like perfumes and other substances made in small amounts.</p>
<p>Work he published two years ago in the prominent research journal Science "was an astonishing advance," and has been cited by hundreds of later researchers, she said.</p>
<p>"Keith's work overturned prior ideas of what is possible," she said, and "this work received tremendous attention from both academic and industrial groups."</p>
<p>"He was also interested in understanding how and why this chemistry occurs: he put forward a completely new idea for the mechanism of this reaction, which has important implications" in broader fields. But while Fagnou won awards for his research, he kept his successes as a scientist to himself, said father-in-law Bob Gervais. "We never heard about the awards. And we're family," he said. "He stays under the radar, but he accomplishes things."</p>
<p>Fourth-year biology student Liane Leclair had Fagnou in first year, and described the professor as a "great prof" whose notes were among the best in the department.</p>
<p>"I was devastated," she said. "I found out Wednesday and I was really sad. He was just an amazing prof, and he seemed like the future of organic chemistry."</p>
<p>Leclair added that the death was especially troubling because Fagnou displayed no signs of being sick.</p>
<p>"There was absolutely nothing wrong with him, and he still passed away," she said. "It's really scary."</p>
<p>Chemistry professor André Beauchemin works in the office two doors down from Fagnou, and said it was startling to see his colleague fine one day and gone the next.</p>
<p>"There's some structures on this board that were drawn by him either Thursday or Friday," he said, gesturing at the blackboard in his office.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of disbelief in the department. He was a great colleague, great friend."</p>
<p>Fagnou is survived by his wife, Danielle Gervais-Fagnou, a family doctor with the University of Ottawa's health services clinic. The couple have three children, Zachary, Clara and Samuel.</p>
<p>The family is to receive friends at McEvoy-Shields Funeral Home on Hunt Club Road on Sunday at noon, followed by a memorial service in the chapel at 2 p.m.</p>

<p>MERIDA, Mexico -- While on non-car business here in the capital of the Mexican state of Yucatan, I couldn't help but notice that when taxi drivers line up to await fares, they turn off their engines, and when it's time to move ahead a few metres, they simply push their cars.</p>
<p>They're not aiming to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions and save us from climate change. They're cutting costs. The recession and swine flu have hurt business. Gas is expensive. They can't afford to burn cash for no reason.</p>
<p>The cabbies aren't making a detectable difference to the amount of carbon entering the atmosphere. They are, however, proving a point made in a new book by California researchers Daniel Sperling and Deborah Gordon. It's called Two Billion Cars, the title referring to the not-distant future when Earth will be home to double its current number of vehicles.</p>
<p>The planet's environment can't cope with that many if they remotely resemble those on the road now and, if we're to believe most of the world's climate scientists, we must be quick about change.</p>
<p>The California duo argue it won't be enough to encourage auto manufacturers to alter their vehicles and fuels: people must want to buy them. And that's going to be a tough sell.</p>
<p>"The world is still in denial about the staggering challenge it faces and the radical transformation it must undertake," the authors say. "Without an incentive to alter their habits, consumers tend to maintain the status quo, even when aware of adverse impacts."</p>
<p>Climate change is too abstract and remote to motivate most people. The majority will respond only to concrete, immediate benefits.</p>
<p>Assuming technology can't be imposed, the book offers a list of schemes to promote green cars, some already tried - very cautiously - in a few places, others not:</p>
<p>Extra charges or punitive taxes on gas guzzlers and rebates for fuel sippers.</p>
<p>Cash payments for electric vehicles or hybrids.</p>
<p>Lower insurance rates or "pay as you drive" schemes that reward those who cut their car use.</p>
<p>Special access to high-occupancy lanes, free parking or free use of toll roads such as Hwy. 407.</p>
<p>Fuel taxes indexed to carbon content.</p>
<p>A carbon tax to raise the cost of gasoline, or a variable tax that would keep the price from dropping below a certain minimum.</p>
<p>Then the authors enter the murky and spooky world of carbon budgets - allotting set amounts of carbon consumption to individuals, cities or companies. All would be required to keep track of their emissions and reduce them by whatever percentage is decreed.</p>
<p>For local governments, it would mean steps like curbing suburban sprawl and supporting more dense development.</p>
<p>Individuals might help to meet their budget by buying more efficient or non-gas vehicles and using them less. Everyone would get the same amount, stored on an electronic card. Like cap and trade on a small scale, those who exceed their budget would have to pay handsomely for additional credits; those below could sell their extras.</p>
<p>Free parking and other incentives are nice, but wouldn't be enough. It's essential to impose economic costs but, as we've seen repeatedly, most people - in their role as voters - oppose increases substantial enough to do the job. So politicians flee from such measures as if there were speeding Hummers bearing down on them. Carbon budgets would be something else again.</p>
<p>In a classic understatement, the authors admit, "it will take some time for consumers to become comfortable with the idea of carbon budgets."</p>
<p>But while we talk about changing car technology, we also have to consider human behaviour. And if we demonstrate that financial benefit is the main motivator, these concepts - daft or Draconian - might be our destination.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>H1N1 queue jumpers should be ashamed</b>
</div><div>1030 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>IN07</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Hospital VIPs get H1N1 vaccine</p>
<p>with no regrets, Nov. 10</p>
<p>Unfortunately the latest rash of queue-jumping for the H1N1 vaccine is a good reflection of our social structure and how some people rise to the top of the hierarchy and defend their positions of privilege. The queue-jumping hospital board members include some of the wealthiest, most well-connected business executives, lawyers and former politicians in the country.</p>
<p>And they do not work in the hospital on a regular basis, yet they have pushed themselves to the front of the line, young children and people with chronic health conditions be damned, simply because they believe they are entitled to priority treatment. They should be ashamed, and perhaps some are, but no doubt most would do it again if given the chance.</p>
<p>Thus, those of us who'd prefer to live in a social democracy rather than a Darwinian society will have to develop stronger checks and balances to prevent such unethical behaviour and impose harsher penalties for those who willingly and knowingly engage in it.</p>
<p>Jeff Denis and Lisa Jackson, Toronto</p>
<p>The queue-jumping hospital board members should not come as a surprise to Ontarians. The public shock only serves to highlight the naivete of many when it comes to health-care delivery. How long do you think the hospital board members wait to see a specialist or to get a non-urgent MRI? I promise you it's not nearly as long as Joe the Plumber would wait. An implicit two-tier health-care system already exisits.</p>
<p>Jeremy Spevick, MD, Toronto</p>
<p>Of course they have no regrets. What the commoners don't understand is that these are truly special people. It says so right in the headline: Very Important People.</p>
<p>Even someone who's stood out in the rain for hours, children in tow, should easily understand that not a single shot could be given without the suit-and-tie crowd slaving away in the boardroom.</p>
<p>You also need to understand that these board members are actually in the same buildings as sick people. Granted, the boardroom isn't exactly next to the ER, but they cannot afford to take any chances.</p>
<p>Now that everyone knows the true danger board members are in, I'm sure that they will feel safer knowing that the VIPs are only doing this for the public's good.</p>
<p>David Stevenson, Kincardine</p>
<p>The queue jumpers belong in the same category as the arrogant, self-entitled CEOs who were instrumental in plunging the world into the major recession from which we are slowly recovering.</p>
<p>It seems that these people, who are in positions of power or influence, feel that they are better and more important than the average citizen. Because of their position they can, and do, break rules meant for everyone.</p>
<p>Shame on them all!</p>
<p>Warren Dalton, Scarborough</p>
<p>If the Titanic started sinking tomorrow, the captain would announce: "Children and pregnant women into the lifeboats first; except, of course, for hockey or basketball players, hospital board members, students from private boarding schools, or anyone else rich, influential or self-important enough to jump the queue."</p>
<p>When the next crisis hits, forget about getting a seat in the lifeboats: they've already been reserved.</p>
<p>Les Parsons, Toronto</p>
<p>Why so upset? It is just normal human (!) behaviour: pork-barreling, feeding at the trough; behaving like pigs; swine flu . . .</p>
<p>Would I do it? You bet I would - if I could unlock my arthritic joints.</p>
<p>Michael Madesker, Downsview</p>
<p>I am not too pleased that Taliban prisoners may receive the H1N1 vaccine ahead of my own children but the fact of the matter is that Canada is a signatory to the Geneva Conventions and this must be respected. Any decision to vaccinate should be made strictly on humanitarian and medical grounds. Once you start to infuse politics into such decisions, you start heading down a slippery slope that leads to justifying goodness-knows-what. If these prisoners need the shots, give it to them; it's what separates us from the likes of the Taliban.</p>
<p>Mark Wakulicz, Elora</p>
<p>Who is responsible for not having the supplies of necessary vaccine? Who decides that the majority of people are, can we say, disposable?</p>
<p>It seems only incompetence is rewarded these days. Will anyone be held accountable for this incompentence or will they get a bonus at the end of the year? Can we sue if we lose a family member who has been unable to get a flu shot?</p>
<p>Doris Moxam, Toronto</p>
<p>Let's not be distracted by a few "queue jumpers." A few hundred pampered athletes and hospital board members did not cause the chaotic long lines, inadequate facilities and significant shortages of vaccine. It is ultimately the federal and provincial politicians and their senior public health administrators who are to blame for creating a panic and failing to meet the resulting demand.</p>
<p>Once this pandemic has run its course let us hope that those who assess the effectiveness of the measures taken and those who will make recommendations to prevent future pandemics are not those same politicians and bureaucrats who have so far mismanaged this pandemic and now choose to deflect the blame on to others.</p>
<p>Blair Morris, Whitby</p>
<p>Why doesn't the vaccine priority list include all the working poor who are just getting by on minimum wages, with no sick pay and sometimes working two jobs? If they got the flu, they would be totally impoverished.</p>
<p>Carol Yung, Toronto</p>
<p>In other jurisdictions, health officials were fired for giving inappropriate access to H1N1 shots. The Toronto hospital board members who pushed to the front of the line show no concern for the sick and vulnerable. They are not at all the kind of people we want making decisions for our hospitals.</p>
<p>I urge these self-centred elitists be dropped from the boards. It will be a challenge finding people with the same connections, but the results will be worth it.</p>

<p>A rising academic star and healthy father of three young children has been identified as one of Ottawa's latest victims of the H1N1 influenza virus.</p>
<p>Keith Fagnou, 38, died on Wednesday in an Ottawa hospital, days after falling ill with what relatives and friends say was the H1N1 flu. A renowned chemist at the University of Ottawa, Mr. Fagnou is not believed to have had any underlying health issues.</p>
<p>He leaves behind his wife Danielle Gervais-Fagnou, who is a doctor, and their three young children: Zachary, 7; Clara, 4; and Samuel, 22 months.</p>
<p>“I just couldn't believe it. Shocked. I still don't believe it,” said cousin Shawna Weeks, one of many relatives in Saskatchewan who were preparing to fly to Ottawa this morning. “He didn't have any health issues … we didn't even know he was in the hospital.”</p>
<p>University of Toronto professor Mark Lautens said Mr. Fagnou, who did graduate studies under his supervision, was “phenomenally successful” in the field of catalytics.</p>
<p>In 2003, Mr. Fagnou won a coveted John C. Polanyi Award, a prize given to a researcher who has made an “outstanding Canadian advance in a field of the natural sciences or engineering.” He was promoted to the role of associate professor two years ago, given the title of University of Ottawa Research Chair in the Development of Novel Catalytic Transformations, and this year became Canada's first winner of the international OMCOS award in organometallic chemistry.</p>
<p>“I think it's safe to say he was the most high-profile rising young star in chemistry in Canada,” Mr. Lautens said last night from Berlin. “I think people put a lot of hope in him for the future of Canadian chemistry, and he was really living up to the billing.”</p>
<p>Raised in Saskatoon and an avid hockey player, Mr. Fagnou earned a bachelor's degree in education and taught high school briefly before returning to study chemistry at the University of Toronto. He met his wife while both served in the naval reserves. Mr. Lautens recalled him as a fun-loving researcher who enjoyed country music and posted cartoons on his academic web page.</p>
<p>A proud father, Mr. Fagnou chose not to attend a conference late last month so as to be able to take his four-year-old daughter trick-or-treating, Mr. Lautens said.</p>
<p>“He was invited to go all over the world [through his work], but still he was paying attention to these things … focusing on the stuff that was actually important,” he said.</p>
<p>Ottawa Public Health has not formally identified him, only saying that an adult male with no underlying health issues died Wednesday with what is suspected to be a case of H1N1 influenza. It was the fourth death in Ottawa this fall to be linked to H1N1. A fifth death was announced yesterday.</p>
<p>“I think [news of the H1N1 involvement] certainly has sent a chill down my spine. He has a spouse who's an MD … you just think, he's as lucky as you can be in the Canadian system of having a highly qualified and loving person right there. And still, there's just some things you cannot control,” Mr. Lautens said.</p>
<p>The University of Ottawa issued a statement expressing its “great sadness” at his sudden death.</p>
<p>A funeral service is planned for tomorrow at Ottawa's McEvoy-Shields Funeral Home.</p>

<p>Eating Animals</p>
<p>By Jonathan Safran Foer</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Little, Brown and Co</span>., 343 pages, $32</p>
<p>There is one fact that keeps coming up in Jonathan Safran Foer's first foray into non-fiction.</p>
<p>It's somehow more troubling than all the other shocking stuff he reveals about the factory farming industry: more than the literal rivers of crap produced at pig farms; more than the casually brutal treatment of animals; more than freshly slaughtered chickens being plunged into "fecal soup" (11 per cent of which is considered an acceptable amount to be allowed to soak in and plump up the meat).</p>
<p>No, the fact that shows the true short-sightedness and unsustainable nature of the factory farming system is this: today's turkeys cannot breed.</p>
<p>Genetically designed to be too top-heavy, too sick, too fast-growing, they can't reproduce naturally; new chicks must be produced by artificial insemination.</p>
<p>That's the most unholy revelation in this wide-ranging, personal and effective exploration of how meat gets to our mouths -- and whether it should at all -- by the Brooklyn-based author of the 2002 novel Everything Is Illuminated.</p>
<p>Foer is not covering new ground here -- the execrable conditions at slaughterhouses (for animals and workers alike), the huge environmental impact of factory farming, the poor (and in many cases, dangerous) quality of the food they produce; all of this has been well documented by authors including Michael Pollan, Eric Schlosser, Temple Grandin and Peter Singer.</p>
<p>Where Foer differs is in his approach. After he wavered for most of his life between omnivorism and vegetarianism, the birth of his first child inspired him to take a closer look at what he was putting in his son's body.</p>
<p>The result is a book that is one part philosophy, one part journalism, one part personal journey and one part family history.</p>
<p>As anyone familiar with Foer's novels will know, he's deeply invested in the ideas of memory and connection. In Eating Animals, he spends a lot of time talking about the importance of food to family and how it ties us to our pasts, but argues that a wilful "forgetting" of what happens on farms does not compensate for all the happy meal-related memories we have; it's time to start creating new stories, he says.</p>
<p>And like his post-modern novels, Eating Animals isn't structured in a conventional way. In among the accounting of the horrors of today's farm system -- many of which he observed first-hand in covert midnight visits to farms -- Foer includes first-person accounts by factory farmers, animal activists, PETA members and heritage turkey farmers.</p>
<p>A glossary, personal anecdotes and graphic elements -- a rectangle on the page shows the space a layer hen has to live in -- make the book highly readable.</p>
<p>Foer is at pains not to be smug about his personal choices or to hector readers, but he is saying, in no uncertain terms, that a person who eats meat is a lesser human being than he is -- less caring, less enlightened.</p>
<p>He may very well be right, but it's a tone that's occasionally off-putting, one that brings into focus all the polarizing arguments that swirl around vegetarianism.</p>
<p>When the Jewish author talks about the painful -- and to his eyes, unnecessary -- ritual of branding cattle, you can't help but want to ask him if he had his son circumcised. (To be fair, it's a reaction Foer predicts and puts down to shame -- why would a reader feel the need to be defensive unless she felt she were doing something wrong?)</p>
<p>There are some facts that can't be argued with, however: the factory farm is a model that any thinking, feeling person must find repugnant, and the food that comes from it is disease-ridden or pumped full of antimicrobials that are lowering human beings' resistance to disease -- including the pandemic flus that are being cooked up on those very factory farms, such as H1N1.</p>
<p>Eating Animals will not convince everyone to give up meat, but it should certainly give pause to those who won't shake hands without applying antibacterial sanitizer but who happily chow down on juicy salmonella-spiked chicken breasts.</p>

</p>
<p>In April 1991, Olympic kayaking gold medallist and Mohawk Warrior Society member Alwyn Morris of Kahnawake brought together aboriginal leaders who cared deeply about the health and wellness of young people.</p>
<p>He also invited decision-makers from Sport Canada, who heard about the hopelessness and poverty that envelop so many First Nation communities, where buying something as commonplace for non-native people as a good pair of children's running shoes, let alone finding funds for an ice rink, is a dream.</p>
<p>Morris envisioned a day when a Canadian Olympic team actually reflected the 3.8 per cent of the Canadian population that identifies as aboriginal.</p>
<p>If we have 200 athletes on the 2010 Olympic team, seven to eight should be aboriginal. But even Tewanee Joseph, CEO of Four Host First Nations, the aboriginal group that represents the four nations on whose traditional lands the Games will take place, admits he knows of no aboriginal athletes on our team to Vancouver.</p>
<p>This October, more than 18 years after Morris' meeting, I found myself in Ottawa with a new generation of aboriginal leaders in sport and they were grappling with the same issues that representatives in 1991 had to confront.</p>
<p>There is still no ministry or department in the federal government whose duty it is to ensure long-term funding and support so aboriginal people can lead healthy, active lives.</p>
<p>Sport Canada did not, despite hearing many heartbreaking stories, decide to run with this particular torch. Their policy on aboriginal people and sport has noncommittal language to prevent the government from taking action. In the 18 years since that first meeting, children have been born and are now young adults -- all the while missing out on physical activity opportunities because, simply put, they are not a priority in this country.</p>
<p>How could they be when Canada and the United States are the only countries not to have signed the UN's Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples?</p>
<p>Aboriginal sports leaders spend most of their time trying to raise money from people who have none. They scramble to borrow sports equipment, rent vans with their own cash because so few parents have safe vehicles, and supply healthy food and clean water so when kids get hungry and thirsty after playing sports, they don't also get sick.</p>
<p>There was an incredible energy in the leaders I met most recently, but their task is monumental. They are expected to move mountains with money raised at bake sales.</p>
<p>Earlier this year we saw aboriginal people in northern Manitoba fall critically ill and die from H1N1 flu in a way that wasn't happening in non-native communities.</p>
<p>If you go to these communities, you will find houses contaminated with mould, open insulation next to mattresses on floors in extraordinarily tiny living quarters and shared slop buckets as toilets instead of running water.</p>
<p>How shameful such conditions exist in a county this rich. Should the Olympic torch relay touch down amongst such poverty, there will be no photo ops inside mouldy, dilapidated homes. We'll see shots of excited children, but when the torch leaves, so will any attention and the nickels and dimes that happen to come along with it. Those children will again be abandoned by a sport system that only shows up to exploit their trust.</p>
<p>Canadians should not be lulled into a complacency that allows them to imagine poverty disappears in the lives of aboriginal people because we shoot through their community with a torch, or we buy Olympic gear made in Haiti, Vietnam, India, Bangladesh and China that sports an aboriginal design.</p>
<p>Or that just because aboriginal people will perform in the opening ceremonies their drinking water is now safe; their kids have sports and recreation programs and they'll be vying for a spot on our next Olympic team.</p>
<p>The Olympics and sport in general should not be an opiate or smokescreen for what is Canada's worst legacy of all: a deeply embedded racism that denies aboriginal people agency in their own lives.</p>
<p>VANOC's Aboriginal Youth Gathering from Jan. 30 to Feb. 14 is a perfect example. First of all, the youth are sent home almost as soon as the Games begin -- suspiciously soon after the evening opening ceremonies of Feb. 12 when the real mega-millions will be made off broadcast rights.</p>
<p>If any of the young people from the youth gathering are performing in them, they must sign away all rights to even one cent of the revenue. In order to come to the gathering, you have to agree to "volunteer."</p>
<p>They had to sign a VANOC contract over five pages long that stipulates, among other things, they will not be paid for their services or have any rights to revenues generated through their artistry and talent.</p>
<p>They have to bring their dancing regalia or drums to Vancouver. In fact, in order to be considered, they must send a photo of themselves in regalia--not in the 21st century clothing they normally wear.</p>
<p>The youth must be able to take direction and perform in front of an international audience, but the contract takes away all their rights as artists. If they compose music, create visual art, choreograph a dance, or dance and drum while in Vancouver, not only will they not be paid for it, they will not be allowed to own their own creations.</p>
<p>When Morris opened his meeting in 1991, he said aboriginal people are tired of being "drums and feathers" trotted in to entertain white people. Alex Nelson, CEO of B.C. Aboriginal Sport and Recreation Association said aboriginal people are alive, thinking, dynamic human beings, not artifacts in a museum.</p>
<p>Real words drowned out by Olympic myths.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mansbridge's new stance is a threat to chairs everywhere</b>
</div><div>WARREN CLEMENTS   </div>
<div>706 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>R14</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

<p>wclements@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>Last week's column discussed CBC-TV's decision to deprive newscaster Peter Mansbridge of his chair, forcing him to stand and even to walk each night on The National. If this uprooting means he no longer truly qualifies as an anchor, at least in its nautical sense, what descriptions might be more appropriate?</p>
<p>Reader Richard Perry remarks that “he is now Peter Standsbridge, of course, and now a walking, not just talking, head.” Gail Benjafield says Mansbridge has become a “newsstand.” Gordon Findlay suggests that this affair “has always been a bit of a fluke,” the fluke being the part of an anchor that “fastens itself to the bottom. But Mr. Mansbridge is no longer resting on his bottom.” Alain Masson asks whether Mansbridge now qualifies as a “floating anchor” – a device, also known as a sea anchor, that acts as a drag on a boat's movement so it won't drift too far from an area or too quickly.</p>
<p>“The idea of wandering newscasters,” Jason Fowler writes, “is rotten to the (an)chor. … Peter Mansbridge is no longer a newscaster but a newscastaway.” The next thing you know, he adds, CEOs will no longer sit at meetings. If so, “will they still have the right to be called chairman (chairperson) of the board? It is time for chairs everywhere not to take this sitting down but to stand up for their rights.”</p>
<p>Fare media no more A few months ago, this column complained about the ungrammatical wording on the tag affixed to monthly transit passes in Toronto: “This fare media is only valid if this sticker is removed.” I am happy to report that the wording has been changed: “Valid only when sticker removed.” It must have been a costly adjustment, though. There is unofficial word that the price of the monthly Metropass will soon rise dramatically.</p>
<p>A difficult bacteria</p>
<p>After reading this column's musings about the H1N1 virus, Tim Nau wrote: “May I draw your attention to the pronunciation of the name of another disease? Clostridium difficile, when abbreviated [as C. difficile], is usually pronounced SEE dih-feh-SEEL, as if it were French.” Since the name of this bacterium is Latin, he writes, it should be pronounced dih-FEE-ki-lay or dih-FEE-chee-lay. On the other hand, if one uses the (bogus) French pronunciation, it has the same sound as “si difficile,” French for “so difficult,” which certainly describes the circumstances of those infected by these bacteria.</p>
<p>The butler must not rebut</p>
<p>An advertisement for a butler caught the Toronto Star's attention last week. According to the newspaper, the live-in position, which would pay $71,400, would require the successful applicant to “drive the luxury cars, manage the wine cellar, pack the suitcases, serve the food.”</p>
<p>The mention of wine recalls the butler's origin. After the Norman Conquest of 1066, the French-speaking invaders and the English-speaking underlings inevitably traded vocabulary. In medieval Latin, the servant who managed the wine cellar and supplied everyone at the table with enough to drink was called a buticularius (from buticula, bottle), which became the Old French word bouteillier, bearer of the cup or bottle. Pushed through the Anglo-French filter, the word became buteler or butuiller, which became the English word butler. Some bright spark in the 1800s created the word “buttle” as a back-formation from butler to describe the pouring of wine, but by the 1900s the verb was being used only as a facetious word for doing what a butler does.</p>
<p>Since it is bad form for butlers to talk back, you might assume that buttle has nothing to do with rebuttal, and you would be right. Rebut comes from the Anglo-French rebuter, combining re (which in Old French indicated opposition) and boter (to butt). At the time, to rebut someone was to repel him, but by the 1800s the lawyers were using it as a term for trying to knock down an opponent's argument. That the opponent might then stammer “but, but, but …” is just a coincidence.</p>

<p>Windsor's top health official is warning citizens to brace for another possible wave of swine flu, after announcing Friday that the pandemic has claimed its first two local victims.</p>
<p>The deaths weren't linked, but neither men were immunized and both had pre-existing health conditions. One of the victims is Joseph "Big Joe" Daoud, 56, from Leamington. He died from a heart attack Nov. 5, minutes after walking into Leamington hospital to get checked out.</p>
<p>"It was an incredible shock," said his 22-year-old son, also named Joseph. "I talked to my father earlier that day and he said he was going to the doctor because he was sick for the last few days. He went to the hospital, he was lying on the bed and he kept yelling to the nurse 'I'm having a heart attack.' He got to the hospital and five minutes later he passed away."</p>
<p>"He had something wrong with his heart, like a valve, but it was also brought on by H1N1. They said the pressure of the flu caused him to have the heart attack."</p>
<p>The other man who died after being infected with H1N1 was a 55-year-old Windsorite. His chronic health issues included diabetes.</p>
<p>There have been more than 160 deaths related to the virus across Canada since the pandemic began last spring.</p>
<p>Daoud leaves behind his wife Dalgis, grown children Joseph, Rose, 24, and Jenny, 19, and a three-month-old granddaughter, Emily. The family didn't know he was infected with H1N1 until test results came back Thursday, a week after he died.</p>
<p>But they were more concerned Friday about how they'll soldier on without their cherished patriarch. Joseph said his father's job for the last 32 years, in the cook room at <span class="companylink">H.J. Heinz</span>, kept him away from home a lot. So every moment he had with his family was precious.</p>
<p>"He would always take me and my sisters to the Spitfires and wrestling matches," Joseph said. "Every Sunday we'd go to the park and we'd go out yard saling. It was a big family thing. My dad would work six days a week and Sunday was mostly his day off, so that was family day. He was giving, he was loving, he was fun to be around. Everybody loved him and he'll be missed."</p>
<p>In addition to the two local deaths, Medical Officer of Health Dr. Allen Heimann said there's been a spike here in the overall number of H1N1 cases. He said Friday there were 134 confirmed cases and another 160 suspected cases.</p>
<p>"To put that number in perspective, in the middle of October we only had 50 cases of H1N1 confirmed," said Heimann.</p>
<p>"So as you can see, we've had significant numbers of cases identified in the last several weeks."</p>
<p>Hotel-Dieu Grace and Windsor Regional hospitals are reporting recent decreases in emergency room visits from people with flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>But Heimann said it's still too</p>
<p>early to tell if that means the</p>
<p>virus wave is subsiding.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the health unit has increased the number of flu shot clinics to keep up with demand. The list of who is eligible for vaccines has expanded to include elementary school children up to age 14 and people 65 and older with chronic medical conditions.</p>
<p>Deb Bennett, director of health protection, said there will also be at least 25 nurses at the clinics as well as other staff to "as best as possible address the long wait periods."</p>
<p>The health unit had 30,000 vaccine doses on Friday, Heimann said, and it should receive more next week.</p>
<p>"I still want to emphasize that the virus is out there and therefore, it is still important for individuals to be immunized," he said.</p>
<p>"The difficulty is you can't predict what's going to happen in the future. We're still in November, which is early, early, early in the flu season. Traditionally, we don't see our flu cases until the middle of December."</p>

</div><div>The Leader-Post</div>
<div>643 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>F11</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>Here is some H1N1 information from www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca], a Health Canada website, where you will be able to find out more about the flu.</p>
<p>BACKGROUND</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is a new strain of pandemic influenza that is different from the seasonal flu. People have no natural immunity to protect against this virus. The H1N1 flu virus emerged in April 2009 and surveillance of its spread shows that it is affecting more young and healthy people than the regular seasonal flu, which normally affects seniors and young children. People with underlying medical conditions, and pregnant women, may be at a greater risk for severe illness.</p>
<p>What is it?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus -- also known as human swine influenza -- is a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs. This virus usually affects pigs, but has been transferred to humans.</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus has caused primarily mild illness in Canada, but Canadians need to be prepared to respond to a potentially more severe form of the virus that may emerge this fall.</p>
<p>How is it spread?</p>
<p>The H1N1 flu virus is contagious and is spread the same way as regular seasonal influenza. This happens when an infected person coughs or sneezes and their germs enter the nose, eyes, or throat of another person. The germs can also rest on hard surfaces like counters and doorknobs, and can be picked up on hands and transmitted to the respiratory system when someone touches his mouth and/or nose. It is not possible to catch it by eating pork or pork products or through blood transfusions.</p>
<p>Contagiousness</p>
<p>More research is being done on how long a person can be infectious (be able to spread the virus to others), but it is believed that this period is for one day before the onset of symptoms and continues for approximately seven days after symptoms have started. The time it takes between being infected and experiencing symptoms is between two and seven days.</p>
<p>Symptoms</p>
<p>- Almost always</p>
<p>Cough and fever</p>
<p>- Common</p>
<p>Fatigue</p>
<p>Muscle aches</p>
<p>Sore throat</p>
<p>Headache</p>
<p>Decreased appetite</p>
<p>Runny nose</p>
<p>- Sometimes</p>
<p>Nausea</p>
<p>Vomiting</p>
<p>Diarrhea</p>
<p>Prevention</p>
<p>- Wash hands often.</p>
<p>- Keep common surfaces disinfected.</p>
<p>- Cough and sneeze into your arm, instead of into your hand.</p>
<p>- If you are sick, stay home until your symptoms are gone and you feel well enough to participate in all activities.</p>
<p>- If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant, have underlying health problems, or if your symptoms get worse, contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>Treatment</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are pregnant or have underlying health problems contact your health-care provider.</p>
<p>If you get flu-like symptoms and are otherwise healthy, you should stay home to recover. If your symptoms worsen, or you experience difficulty breathing or serious shortness of breath, it is important to seek medical attention.</p>
<p>Antivirals are drugs used for the early treatment of influenza. If taken shortly after getting sick (within 48 hours), they can reduce influenza symptoms, shorten the length of illness and potentially reduce the serious complications of influenza. Antivirals do not prevent you from getting sick.</p>
<p>Canada has a National Antiviral Stockpile of 55 million doses of two antiviral drugs -- Tamiflu and Relenza. Both are effective in treating H1N1 flu virus. This stockpile is enough for all Canadians who will need and want treatment.</p>
<p>Antivirals are recommended for the treatment of moderate to severe illness, and for people at risk of severe disease. Your doctor will decide if treatment is right for you.</p>
<p>Vaccination</p>
<p>Influenza vaccines (also called flu shots) help you to prevent getting sick by introducing your body to a weakened or dead version of the virus to teach your body to build immunity to it.</p>

</p>
<p>Question: Does the risk to contract the H1N1 virus increase if you fly, particularly for long flights? Should a person wear a mask on a plane as a preventative measure?</p>
<p>Answer: Social distancing is difficult for anyone travelling, whether on a flight, by bus, or even in a vehicle. The first rule of thumb is that if you are sick, stay home. Do not spread the virus. If you are well and are travelling, the best method of self-protection remains to wash your hands often as flu viruses are most often transmitted when you have touched a contaminated surface then your mouth, nose or eyes. Wearing a mask does not offer reliable protection against the virus as most people are just as likely to transmit the virus on their hands when putting the mask on or taking it off. Remember that the vast majority of people who contract H1N1 will only experience a mild illness lasting three or four days.</p>

<p>Carrying a bright yellow and green stuffed frog into south Regina's Ecole Monseigneur de Laval on Friday morning, Patrick Duval had "comfort measures" in hand for his children when they got their H1N1 shots.</p>
<p>The furry frog didn't stave off the tears of Noah, Duval's seven-year-old son, when he got the poke. But Nichole, 8, didn't flinch from the flu shot.</p>
<p>"My son was quite fearful about getting it, so I wanted to come down here and support him," Duval said. "My daughter was really good about it. She barely blinked an eye and Noah was surprised by how uneventful it was. It was quick."</p>
<p>Initially, Duval had reservations about his children getting the vaccination.</p>
<p>"You hear rumours about it not being around long enough to have a good test, but I think the H1N1 threat is more dangerous," Duval said. "Now I feel good about it."</p>
<p>Still, the <span class="companylink">SaskTel</span> employee hasn't decided if he'll get immunized.</p>
<p>"Whether I come down with it or not, at least my kids won't be affected," he said. "If I do get vaccinated, it will be to protect my co-workers. I get colds, but I can't remember the last time I got the flu."</p>
<p>Baptiste Labrie-Boulay, 8, was unfazed by the shot. After the little boy was vaccinated, he nonchalantly drank a box of wildberry punch and said: "It did not hurt."</p>
<p>Immunization clinics at Regina schools began this week. On Friday, about 160 of the 190 students eligible for the H1N1 vaccine at Regina's only francophone school were immunized, said Remi Lemoine, principal of the school's pre-kindergarten- to-Grade 7 students.</p>
<p>His own four children were among those who rolled up their sleeves.</p>
<p>"It's very convenient for parents to have their children vaccinated at school -- there are no waits," Lemoine said.</p>
<p>He noted some children have missed school because they've been sick, but absenteeism has not exceeded 10 per cent on any day.</p>
<p>"The highest percentage was six per cent on one day and there is no confirmation that any students have had H1N1," he said.</p>
<p>He saluted the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region's staff for helping the school prepare for the pandemic -- particularly Sandra Hextall, an administrative assistant in the population and public health services branch.</p>
<p>"The collaboration with the region has been wonderful," Lemoine said.</p>
<p>In preparation for the pandemic, hand sanitizer units were ordered for the school's entrances a month ago, but they're still on back order, Lemoine said.</p>
<p>In art and health classes, Grade 4 students made colourful posters to remind everyone in the school about the proper cough etiquette, the importance of handwashing and the need to eat healthy and get lots of rest. Grade 4 teacher Emmanuelle Roby said wellness lessons are reinforced in the classroom.</p>
<p>"Every time they come back from recess, they wash their hands and in the classroom, we have two bottles of hand sanitizer," Roby said. "Anytime they're coughing, they cough in their sleeve and they're reminded not to put their hands in their mouths. When they're sick, they know to stay at home."</p>

between three and 10 years who have already received a half dose of
the H1N1 vaccine will not require a second dose. Children under the
age of three and those with health conditions will require a second
dose, but they can receive it anytime after 21 days of their first
dose.

<div id="hd"><b>Industry needs higher prices for pigs, experts say</b>
</div><div>Cassandra Kyle   </div>
<div>Saskatchewan News Network; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>508 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>Regina Leader Post</div><div>RLP</div><div>Final</div><div>D1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Regina Leader Post   </div>
</p>
<p>While federal and provincial assistance programs help Saskatchewan pork producers carry the burden created by the weak hog market, local experts say nothing but a rise in prices for pigs will bring the industry back to a healthy state.</p>
<p>"All the things we can do here as government still can't offset what improved prices would do," Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud said Friday.</p>
<p>"It's almost like the hog producers can't win right now ... It's a cycle we're going through, but it's certainly lasting a lot longer than anyone had hoped."</p>
<p>A combination of a rising Canadian dollar, higher grain prices, an increase in transportation costs and weaker consumer demand -- some of which can be linked to the H1N1, or so-called swine flu, outbreak -- over an extended period of time has left the hog industry at a loss.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Saskatchewan's largest hog producer, <span class="companylink">Big Sky Farms Inc</span>., filed for creditor protection as a result of the extended downturn in the industry.</p>
<p>Bjornerud said programs to help livestock producers, such as the joint federal provincial AgriStability Targeted Advanced Payments program, are available to Saskatchewan producers who are losing money on their hogs due to low market prices.</p>
<p>Still, the industry needs pork prices to rise, he added.</p>
<p>"I think, myself, as (agriculture) minister, along with all the livestock sector -- have our fingers crossed that that cycle will start to improve and go upwards and get to the point where they can break even and then actually make a few dollars," he said.</p>
<p>Neil Ketilson, general manager of the Saskatchewan Pork Development Board (Sask Pork), said hogs that cost between $125 and $135 to raise are being sold for $105, leaving producers holding the short end of the stick.</p>
<p>"We need to have a fairly significant bump in prices to get to break-even levels," Ketilson said. "The industry has gone through about two and a half to three years of unprecedented losses."</p>
<p>Several Saskatchewan producers have stopped raising pigs, and the number of hogs sent to market from the province is slipping, Ketilson explained.</p>
<p>Last year, he added, 1.4 million hogs were sent to market, down from a high of 2.4 million hogs a few years earlier.</p>
<p>Ketilson believes there is a bright spot on the horizon for the pork sector. Futures markets in May and June 2010 show hog prices at $140 per head, meaning producers could once again be making a profit.</p>
<p>Until then, pork producers will continue to go down a bumpy road. If Big Sky found itself in a position to file for creditor protection, Ketilson said, smaller operations are surely feeling the pinch.</p>
<p>"They're a very well-managed company. Their cost of production is as good as anywhere in North America, and so when you see them going through what they are, you know that there's serious conditions for everybody," he said.</p>

</p>
<p>Junk science has become a plague in the Internet era, but now the problem seems to be growing worse, with what we might call junk fiction. The human ability to confuse and panic</p>
<p>ourselves seems to be growing even faster than genuine scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The U.S. space agency found it necessary this week to announce, in full formal solemnity, that the world will not be coming to an end on Dec. 21, 2012. A $200-million U.S. movie about that particular brand of apocalypse hit cinemas on Friday, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration felt the need to assure anxious Americans that the mysterious planet Nibiru does not exist and so is unlikely to strike the earth; that the Sumerians knew little about celestial mechanics; that the Mayan calendar does indeed extend past that date; and that we had many of these same rumours about May 2003, which came and went uneventfully.</p>
<p>Somewhere the marketing team behind this movie is out getting estimates on yachts and mansions, but we see something here that transcends mere hype. Mystical pseudo-science, conspiracy theories, and crank beliefs of all kind seem to be growing distressingly pervasive.</p>
<p>From seeing a plot behind H1N1 flu inoculation to thinking Elvis is alive to thinking George Bush destroyed New York's twin towers to</p>
<p>taking Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown seriously to expecting the end of the world, too many people in so-called advanced societies are dabbling, or worse, in gnostic theories utterly divorced from reality.</p>
<p>We understand that the end of the world might make a good date movie, and that finding cabals under every cabbage leaf can be amusing. But the speed and intensity with which certain crackpot theories spread is also somewhat alarming.</p>
<p>Why isn't it apparent that human progress is based on scientific method, reasoned analysis of problems, and simple common sense?</p>
<p>Here's how we like to think about these harebrained theories: People who believe in conspiracies just don't realize how difficult it is to organize anything.</p>

</p>
<p>Money might make the average person forget about the little guy, but it's pretty much the opposite in government.</p>
<p>If you have money, it's easier to remember the little guys. But if you're a government starting to struggle, it's sometimes just as easy to forget about them.</p>
<p>That things have been tightening up in Saskatchewan Party government ranks was obvious even before Finance Minister Rod Gantefoer's confusing messaging this week that Saskatchewan "wasn't in a recession", that "we might be in recession by year's end" and finally that "we were in recession, but are already coming out of it."</p>
<p>A far more consistent message that those of us who hang out under the dome have been hearing is the grumbling from civil servants about belt-tightening and even how ill-prepared the government is to adjust to the new reality.</p>
<p>But perhaps the surest sign of tightening belts has been in Premier Brad Wall's recent struggles to address the issues of the little guy -- something that Wall and his government had been very good at.</p>
<p>Although it usually came as a grand public gesture mostly designed to curry voter favour (or sometimes to embarrass the previous NDP government for its past failings), there's little question that Wall placed</p>
<p>special emphasis on those small groups looking for help. Consider the government's agenda in its early days: funding under the prescription drug program for the life-extending cancer drug Avastin; support for disabled groups; financial payments to the nine women working in the old parks and recreation department that were deemed to have been harassed by Murdoch Carriere, and; the income tax relief for the poorest of the working poor who have most benefited from the government's decision to increase minimum exemption levels.</p>
<p>In fact, historians will likely chalk up the success of the Sask. Party administration in the early going to three things: the earnest credibility of Finance Minister Rod Gantefoer delivering what appeared at the time to be solid, sustainable budgets; the likability of Brad Wall as a conservative premier with a heart who has been eager to invest in the problems of the ordinary folks and; the financial wherewithal to show the Sask. Party is more than a pro-business, right-wing administration by addressing the problems of the little people.</p>
<p>Like his predecessor Lorne Calvert, Wall has also quietly demonstrated a remarkable generosity when it comes to doing things for ordinary people with little or no fanfare and at virtually no cost other than his time. Among such gestures was his willingness to: ensure cancer victim Chris Knox made it to the 2007 Grey Cup before his death; attend every fallen Saskatchewan soldier's funeral, and; pop up in the Health Ministry to tell the staff they've been doing a good job on the H1N1 file in the face of public criticism.</p>
<p>That said, it's easier for any premier to be seen as a nice guy if he's got the money to throw at the needs of people.</p>
<p>And judging by mounting demands, that's getting increasingly hard for the Sask. Party government to do.</p>
<p>Despite its recent floundering in the polls, the NDP Opposition has managed in recent question periods to raise a number of issues demonstrating the government's struggles to meet those needs. One such issue was the administrators for the JobStart Future Skills program telling applicants that "all of the money is committed" -- not exactly a great demonstration of how we're protecting the needs of the vulnerable as we come out of this recession.</p>
<p>More damning, however, were concerns from Saskatchewan Families for Effective Autism Treatment -- another issue the Sask. Party championed in opposition -- that this province was becoming an "autism wasteland" because of the underfunding of support programs.</p>
<p>Also this week, we heard the Children's Advocate saying little or no progress was being made on serious problems in foster homes. While appointing the infinitely credible former NDP cabinet minister Bob Pringle to lead the one-year review of child welfare was a wise move, it's evident that more financial support is needed here as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Wall, it's no longer so easy to find the money to provide that support.</p>

<p>I was disappointed to read in the</p>
<p>Oct. 7 article "Nurses shifted to</p>
<p>battle flu threat," that the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region did not plan to utilize its licensed practical nurses to provide H1N1 immunizations, but would use part-time, casual and retired registered nurses and psychiatric nurses to fill the 63 additional full-time positions needed to staff the H1N1 immunization clinics. A region official was quoted as saying, "they (LPNs) can potentially be immunizers . . . only for people who are over five years of age and only under the direction of a registered nurse."</p>
<p>Not entirely true. The LPN Act, which was passed into legislation in 2000, gave LPNs the authority to care for their own clients without the direction of a registered nurse. It is disappointing to see that despite this years-old legislation, the Regina Qu'Appelle Health Region still appears to harbour old prejudices about what LPNs can and cannot do.</p>
<p>It is within the scope of practice of the LPN with additional education in immunizations to administer immunizations to clients over the age of five. This additional education is the identical six hour training the region had to give its RNs and RPNs before they were allowed to give H1N1 immunizations.</p>
<p>The contribution of LPNs to this undertaking may have eliminated the necessity and cost of rehiring and relicensing retired RNs so that they could do H1N1 immunizations. It would have been an important training and work opportunity for those LPNs who were willing and able to assist in the mass H1N1 immunization. It would have also been a significantly more efficient use of the Region's limited resources.</p>

<p>When H1N1 broke back in April, I was in the eye of the storm, the heart of the action, the centre of the burrito. I was in Mexico.</p>
<p>My group of Canadian travel journalists was calmly taken aside by a Mexican Tourist Board representative and given a debriefing that began with something to the effect of: "Now don't freak out, but . . ."</p>
<p>At that point, though, the severity of the virus hadn't hit home. A few days later, we connected through Mexico City's airport and, bam, the panic response kicked in. That's what happens when one in three people are wearing surgical masks and your breathing holes are naked. Canadian customs in Toronto was offered no solace: the masked agents looked equipped to languish in a mustard gas sauna.</p>
<p>Like any normal individual, during the two- to seven-day incubation period that followed I convinced myself that I had swine flu.</p>
<p>Was my, um, particularly aqueous waste more than just an average Mexican souvenir? Was the minor tickle in my throat a sign to go coffin shopping -- or was it just a shard of popcorn I ate at the movie theatre (where I might have spread the pandemic to 50 innocent people)?</p>
<p>Three weeks later, I had another encounter with H1N1's global impact. I was en route to Macedonia, and, of course, H1N1 crossed my mind so I washed my hands frequently and resolved not to make out with any strangers on the plane (believe me, it was challenging given the romantic mood set by a choir of screaming babies).</p>
<p>At Skopje's minuscule airport, a crew of doctors in lab coats was hastily tacking up signs that instructed certain citizens -- including Canadians -- to pick up a piece of paper that ordered a check-up at a medical clinic.</p>
<p>Now, as fears mount about a possible second strain of the virus circulating this fall, people ask whether I'm going to curtail my travels. Or, at the very least, order a mask, gloves and coverall suit from fluarmour.com. Maybe some disinfectant spray, too, to wield against sneezy foes.</p>
<p>The answer to all of the above is: no. As long as we're healthy, there's no reason to stop travelling until the government tells us to.</p>
<p>People already cough up (excuse the pun) so many excuses for not travelling: money, time, language barriers. Adding negative hype to that list only succeeds in wasting your own opportunities to get out there and live. Just think about everyone who quaked in their slippers and stayed put for years after 9-11.</p>
<p>I hope to meet you on a flight in the near future. But, uh . . . keep the handshake to yourself, please.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Sanitizing gymnasium makes sense in flu season</b>

<p>Exercise is a known immunity booster, which is why Health Canada recommends regular workouts as part of its strategy to protect against the H1N1 virus. But is the gym the best place to avoid the flu, or is the shared equipment and sweaty population prime breeding ground for a virus that experts say has reached pandemic status?</p>
<p>"You're more likely to get the flu from the guy on the treadmill next to you than from the treadmill itself," said Dalius Briedis, an infectious disease specialist at the McGill University Health Centre (MUHC).</p>
<p>H1N1 is predominantly transferred from individual to individual through aerosol droplets in the air which means being coughed on by someone beside you is the most likely way for the flu to be transmitted. So, the first step in staying healthy is asking exercisers to avoid the gym when they are sick.</p>
<p>That being said, Briedis noted that it is possible for the virus to stay viable for a short period of time on a hard surface like a piece of fitness equipment. Therefore it's prudent to take extra precautions when using equipment that is passed from one exerciser to the next, like cardio and weight training machines, exercise balls and dumbbells.</p>
<p>"If you come in contact with the virus and then touch your face, nose or eyes, it's possible to get the flu," said Briedis.</p>
<p>Wiping down equipment with a cleaning solution after use, draping a clean towel over an exercise mat or bench and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer before and after a workout should be standard practice in gyms across the country.</p>
<p>But gym rats aren't the only exercisers who need to take special precautions when it comes to avoiding the flu. According to Briedis sport teams are also at increased risk of exposure to the H1N1 virus. The proximity of athletes to each other and to their personal belongings makes the virus easy to pass along from one teammate to the next. And once the flu hits one team member, there's no telling how quickly it will spread and the kind of impact it can have on a team's ability to field enough players to compete.</p>
<p>Simple precautions can reduce the risk. Water bottles and towels shouldn't be shared between athletes (all towels should be removed from team benches) and a protocol should be in place to keep sick athletes away from their healthy teammates.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends quarantining an athlete until they are symptom free (no coughing, sneezing or fever) for 24 hours. If an athlete gets sick on the road, they should be put in a private room and wear a mask during the bus ride home where they should sit as far away from their teammates as possible. The same goes for the sick athlete's roommate who should be kept under a watchful eye for three days before placing them back on the playing roster.</p>
<p>As for the ritual of shaking hands after a game, Briedis isn't in favour of suspending this age old tradition. With physical contact a natural consequence of most team sports, there is little to be gained by forgoing shaking hands, especially if athletes wash their hands or use hand sanitizers immediately after the game.</p>
<p>The ritual Briedis is in favour of forgoing, however, is the Montreal two-cheek kiss, which he claims should be suspended until after the H1N1 virus runs its course.</p>
<p>If the flu does strike, the decision to exercise or compete is probably moot as fever and the associated aches and pains will relegate all but the hardiest to bed until the symptoms abate. The average time to recuperate is three to seven days, after which exercisers are encouraged to get back in the game or gym slowly.</p>
<p>Briedis recommends waiting for 24 hours after the fever has abated before resuming light exercise. A body recuperating from the flu is quick to fatigue, so respect the signals your body is sending and take it easy if you feel less than 100 per cent during your workout.</p>
<p>Precautions should also be taken before exercising in the cold, especially if your flu symptoms included a cough and runny nose. Cold air can further irritate already inflamed bronchial pathways, causing a rebound case of bronchitis and another couple of days in bed.</p>
<p>Once you feel up to speed, go ahead and resume your normal workouts. Exercise is still the best medicine for a healthy mind and body.</p>

<p>A Saskatoon nursing student has more questions than answers about H1N1 and she wants to find out if others feel the same way.</p>
<p>"The stress from this is just unreal. You can't go anywhere without hearing at least one conversation between people about it," said Heather Martin, a second-year nursing student.</p>
<p>"This H1N1 pandemic is affecting Canadians on such a wide range of levels -- financially and emotionally."</p>
<p>Much of the stress stems from conflicting information, says Martin, who is conducting an online survey to determine what people know about the virus and the vaccine.</p>
<p>"Is this pandemic hyped up and really as bad as people are telling us? Or are you better to wait it out?"</p>
<p>Martin has posted the survey on a new website she has designed called Canadian Heart and Patriotism, which highlights the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</p>
<p>"There are so many other countries that we could have been born into that might oppress us or restrict our liberties or freedom of speech. I'm taking that God-given right that as a Canadian I've been given to express my freedom of speech and to give other people the opportunity to check out things that are Canadian and get them thinking about what it means to them to be Canadian," said Martin.</p>
<p>The H1N1 pandemic fits with that theme, because Canadians are being given the choice whether to be vaccinated or not, she explains.</p>
<p>The 15-question poll at www.saskcan.webs.com/poll.htm[http://www.saskcan.webs.com/poll.htm] reflects Martin's own personal debate about the mass immunization campaign.</p>
<p>"I looked at all the questions I had myself -- sort of a pros and cons list that I had when I was trying to decide whether to get myself and my kids vaccinated."</p>
<p>As a special care aide at a long-term care facility, Martin decided to be vaccinated through her workplace. She has since taken her two children to Prairieland Park to be immunized.</p>
<p>Martin hopes 1,000 Canadians will complete her survey within the next couple of months. She then plans to tabulate the results that will form the basis of a research project she will do for school. She also plans to provide the report to provincial and federal politicians.</p>
<p>"The report will cast light on what the people want to see happen in future pandemics and call for action regarding the safety of vaccines," she said.</p>
<p>The poll doesn't ask questions about income, education or gender, but Martin believes the information she collects will be valid in the way election results are valid even though voters don't declare demographic information.</p>

<p>FLU ASSESSMENT CENTRE OPENS THIS AFTERNOON</p>
<p>The Saskatoon Health Region is opening a special flu assessment centre to cope with the many patients grappling with influenza-like symptoms.</p>
<p>The clinic, which opens this afternoon at St. Paul's Hospital, is to help divert the many patients fighting viruses away from overtaxed emergency rooms.</p>
<p>In a Friday news release, the region's director of ambulatory care planning, Leanne Smith, says the clinic has a triage plan for people experiencing varying degrees of flu-like illness.</p>
<p>"This will help reduce viral infection spread in waiting rooms, (and) fast track services for those with influenza-like illness so they can be assessed and treated as quickly as possible," Smith said. "This will help take pressure off emergency departments."</p>
<p>Last November, the city's three emergency rooms were seeing an average of 300 patients per day.</p>
<p>This November, with the advent of H1N1 pandemic influenza, they're seeing about 400 people per day.</p>
<p>The region says children with severe flu-like symptoms should go to the Royal University Hospital emergency room.</p>
<p>Adults who want to get their influenza symptoms checked out should head to the influenza assessment centre at St. Paul's.</p>
<p>Dr. James Stempien, the region's department head of emergency services, says mild flu-like illness doesn't usually require medical care.</p>
<p>When symptoms last about a week and include fever, chills, headache, muscle aches, cough, sore throat or a runny nose, Stempien recommends you stay home and treat your symptoms on your own, to preserve health-care resources for patients who are seriously ill.</p>
<p>The St. Paul's influenza clinic will be open today, Sunday and Monday from 4:30 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., and will be staffed by a nurse practitioner and a registered nurse.</p>
<p>They'll be assessing and directing patients based on a screening tool the region has developed.</p>
<p>The region says if the clinic is successful, the pilot project may be extended into next week until the pressure on the city's emergency rooms wanes.</p>

<p>"I refuse to issue this vaccine," says Dr. Pascale Blucher, a Swiss doctor who recently told swissinfo.ch that safety was compromised in the rush to develop the H1N1 vaccine. "It goes against the first rule of medicine, which is to do no harm."</p>
<p>Talk about adding to the confusion surrounding H1N1. As a believer in routine childhood vaccines and as someone who -- a month ago -- fully intended to get my four-year-old vaccinated, I found Blucher's comments arresting.</p>
<p>Among the major issues for Blucher is the use of adjuvants -- chemical compounds contained in all H1N1 vaccines in Canada, except those for pregnant women -- that "stretch" a vaccine's active ingredient and boost the body's immune response.</p>
<p>European flu vaccines commonly use adjuvants for adults and the elderly, but there's limited clinical data on how safe they are for children and pregnant women.</p>
<p>"The problem is, we're going to vaccinate people, then see if there are any bad effects," Blucher said.</p>
<p>When I initially asked my doctor about the adjuvant, he said it would be a good idea to give my son the non-adjuvanted vaccine, "just to be on the safe side."</p>
<p>But before any vaccines were available, my son got sick. Nothing too serious -- a slight fever, dry cough (which got worse at night) and a very runny nose.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I was experiencing serial headaches, a sore throat, chills, aches, a dry cough and had some trouble focusing. Nevertheless, I could manage day-to-day and, having had influenza in the past, I didn't think it was H1N1.</p>
<p>Then, on the information front, I experienced another shocker: In the Wall Street Journal, I read that the U.S. wasn't administering any adjuvanted vaccine. Multi-dose vials (being used in Canada) had also been nixed in the U.S., so as to lessen exposure to mercury-containing thimerosal.</p>
<p>"A series of policy decisions that reflect our extreme caution when it comes to these products are to blame for the shortfall of the vaccine in the U.S.," the WSJ wrote.</p>
<p>But isn't "extreme caution" what we want? Let's not forget FDA inspector Dr. Frances Oldham Kelsey, who received an award from president John F. Kennedy in 1962 for blocking thalidomide in the U.S. because "more study was needed."</p>
<p>Why, I wondered, weren't Canadian and American health officials being asked to debate their respective H1N1 decisions? What lessons were learned in Australia, which came off its flu season just as ours was beginning? And is there really "more mercury in a tin of tuna than in the H1N1 vaccine," as I've heard said?</p>
<p>Why are we just "learning," as was reported this week, that seniors -- who were bottom of the priority list a few weeks ago -- "have less chance of getting H1N1, but if they get it, they can die?" And is it really wise for nurses at local health centres to be piggy-backing H1N1 vaccines with regular childhood boosters?</p>
<p>Ontario health officer Dr. Richard Schabas recently said he largely blames health officials for creating H1N1 hysteria, when "far more people die of seasonal flu" every year. He added the "pandemic" is peaking, and after going through a flu cycle of about six weeks, kids across the country are starting to go back to school -- which I've noticed at my son's pre-kindergarten.</p>
<p>When Saskatoon health officials finally rolled out the vaccine, I drove to Prairieland Park to ask about the availability of non-adjuvanted vaccine for young children. I was told none was available, except for pregnant women.</p>
<p>The next day, I learned a boy in my son's class, who'd been off sick the week before, had received the results of a nose swab, which confirmed H1N1. In other words, my son and I had probably had it, too.</p>
<p>So, for a range of reasons, I'll probably pass on the vaccine, which doesn't mean I don't feel let down for having been deprived of a lot of useful, comparative information along the way.</p>
<p>After the hormone replacement therapy (HRT) debacle and concerns over the Gardasil vaccine's side-effects on young women -- not to mention the last swine flu vaccine, which reportedly killed more people in the U.S. than actually died of swine flu -- advising Canadians to simply "trust us" and ask questions later just isn't good enough.</p>

<p>Washington 3 Minnesota 1</p>
<p>Brian Pothier scored the go-ahead goal early in the third period as the Capitals won their fourth in a row without Alex Ovechkin, beating the Wild 3-1 at home. The NHL's highest scoring team was nearly thwarted by backup goalie Josh Harding, who more than doubled his save total for the entire season. But Pothier's wrist shot from the left circle two minutes into the final period hit just inside the far post to beat Harding, who was screened on the play. Harding made 38 saves after entering the game having stopped only 35 of 46 shots this season. Mike Green also scored for Washington and Brooks Laich added an empty-netter. Cal Clutterbuck scored for Minnesota while Semyon Varlamov made 29 saves for the Capitals.</p>
<p>NY Islanders 4 Carolina 3 (OT)</p>
<p>Kyle Okposo scored with 14.4 seconds left in overtime, and John Tavares had his first two-goal game to help the Islanders beat the Hurricanes in Raleigh, extending Carolina's winless streak to 14 games. Mark Streit added a goal, and Martin Biron made 26 saves for New York. The Islanders blew a three-goal lead before winning in overtime. Okposo, who was questionable for the game because of swine flu, took advantage of a Carolina turnover and snapped the puck past Hurricanes goalie Manny Legace. Tuomo Ruutu, Ray Whitney and Tim Gleason scored for Carolina. The Hurricanes matched the franchise record with their 14-game winless streak.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Next big job awaits; William Thorsell transformed the Globe and the ROM, and he isn't done yet</b>
</div><div>Peter Kuitenbrouwer   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>1720 words</div><div>14 November 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>Toronto</div><div>A20</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>With this profile of ROM CEO William Thorsell, Peter Kuitenbrouwer begins our series on Toronto's most intriguing people.</p>
<p>When the waiter at Pangaea, wearing a pumpkincoloured shirt, comes to tell us the specials, William Thorsell -- who has not opened the menu -- does not hesitate. ''I'll have the liver," he says.</p>
<p>The Yorkville bistro, where tall-backed, severe oak dining chairs contrast with an undulating stainless steel ceiling, fills with a lunch crowd in business attire. Clayton Ruby, the lawyer, sits at the next table; he and Mr. Thorsell exchange waves. Mr. Thorsell, who is 64, is a slight man with a soft voice, white hair and a patrician air. Do not be fooled. He is restless and can be ruthless. He has announced his resignation from the ROM effective next August. He is looking for the next big thing.</p>
<p>"I'm just at the age where I can still do something else at the end," he says, spreading roasted beet butter on olive bread. "What is that fourth act? At least there's potential to tap into something interesting while I have time."</p>
<p>Throughout his career Mr. Thorsell has led dowdy institutions through epochal change. He transformed The Globe and Mail as its editor, and used the paper to champion the free trade project of his close friend, then-prime minister Brian Mulroney. The merits of free trade are as hotly debated as Mr. Thorsell's next big job: blowing up the hidebound Royal Ontario Museum with German architect Daniel Libeskind. (The other day, a top ROM official privately called Mr. Libeskind a "phony.") The result of their collaboration -- "Billy's Crystal," as one headline writer dubbed it -- is a cacophony of steel swathed in aluminum and drywall that, for better or worse, defines Toronto.</p>
<p>Both jobs have made Mr. Thorsell a target of wrath. The Ryerson Review of Journalism chided Mr. Thorsell for "a hostile makeover," at the Globe. At the ROM, Mr. Thorsell faced a much greater challenge: the museum's history of collegiality, which dates back to its roots with the University of Toronto. Mr. Thorsell could not reward and punish staff as he had done at the Globe -- they pushed back hard against him. The Museum, Kenton Vaughan's documentary about Mr. Thorsell's "Renaissance ROM" project (National Film Board, 2008) shows the museum director clashing with curators, critics and the community. Mark Kingwell, the U of T philosophy professor, offers a vicious summary: "We're not necessarily getting buildings that are interesting or serviceable or inspiring to the community. We're getting somebody's ego on paper and then stuck up into the air for who knows how many decades."</p>
<p>Does Mr. Thorsell have ego? Plenty. That is not always a bad thing. And the documentary celebrates another of Mr. Thorsell's gifts: courage. Mr. Thorsell not only leveraged private cash to fund a dramatic rethink of the ROM; he gamely permitted the filmmaker to chronicle the entire bloodbath. "He kept pushing us to make the process as transparent as possible," says Dan Rahimi, the museum's vice-president of gallery development. Mr. Thorsell's rise to power from humble roots also teaches us a comforting lesson about our city: Toronto is at least to some extent a meritocracy.</p>
<p>So often Toronto has needed outsiders to shake things up. Mr. Thorsell didn't get here until he was almost 40. His father, Arnold Thorsell, earned a half-acre in Edmonton upon his discharge from the Royal Canadian Air Force, and built a house himself where William, the middle of three children, grew up. The boy climbed academe to an assistant deanship at Princeton University. At lunch he explained that he "rode the front of the wave of demography and circumstance."</p>
<p>"I was able to go to grad school when people paid you to go to grad school," he says. "I went through all my university on a scholarship, and I came out of each year of school with more money than I started with. I was just at the front of the Boomers."</p>
<p>In 1977 Mr. Thorsell joined the Edmonton Journal ; he moved to the Globe in 1984. In 1989 he became editor in chief, a post he held until 1999. Mr. Thorsell retooled the Globe, symbolized by scrapping the gothic type that spelled out its name. "I wanted to put a new name plate," he says. ''After 140 years, why not?"</p>
<p>"He was inventive, contrarian, mischievous, arrogant and could be witheringly blunt -- all qualities guaranteed to terrify that sleepy,</p>
<p>complacent newsroom and build a better paper," recalls Sarah Murdoch, a longtime Globe editor now at the National Post. "His magnificent condescension was amusing when it was happening to someone else, less so when you were the target -- and we all got our turn."</p>
<p>Kimberley Noble, a business journalist who joined the Globe the same year as Mr. Thorsell and stayed about the same length of time, recalls his transformation from "Bill" to "William." "Those people who had the dinners and the sparkling wine provided him with an entry to a world that interested him much more than his people at the newspaper, so it became very important not to make those people upset," says Ms. Noble, now a journalism teacher at the University of Guelph.</p>
<p>Even so, Ms. Noble praises Mr. Thorsell as "a renaissance man, of many talents and interests." Those talents, coupled to his connections in high places, landed Mr. Thorsell the ROM job in 2000. "William had no museum background," says Mr. Rahimi. "That was a very unusual selection for the ROM."</p>
<p>In the documentary The Museum, Mr. Thorsell and Mr. Rahimi clash; ultimately Mr. Rahimi grew to respect his boss. "William is very consistent. He has strong opinions about design," Mr. Rahimi said the other day, drinking coffee in the ROM's basement cafeteria. "He is always very clear and he's open to discussion. If I disagree with him we argue."</p>
<p>He recalls how curators resisted Mr. Thorsell's eagerness to display The Egyptian Book of the Dead. "Twenty-five hundred years old, done on papyrus, gilded in real gold, incredibly fragile. William said, 'We gotta get this on display. This thing has been in the dark for 2,500 years, let it be exposed to light for 10 months.' He isn't enmeshed in a curatorial view of the world. He respects it but doesn't suffer from being hobbled by it."</p>
<p>Mr. Thorsell explains: "A museum is a newspaper in slow motion. Go out there, get information, bring it in, it's processed and bring it out to the public."</p>
<p>Mr. Thorsell is as intense at home as at the office. Each morning, he rises in the Moore Park home where he lives alone, and sits down at his 2000 Yamaha, a gift from his later father.</p>
<p>"Before I come downtown, I play piano every morning for an hour," he says, slicing with gusto into his provimi liver, grilled with glazed organic vegetables, pommes puree and merlot stewed lingonberries. "It is very good therapy or exercise. Very good for the brain and, I suppose, for the heart."</p>
<p>Mr. Thorsell has broken barriers as a powerful man who is openly gay. In an extensive interview with Fab, "The gay scene magazine," he said, "the gift of the edge in my case was being gay." Fab called the ROM remake "Drag architecture at its finest." Mr. Thorsell's friends enjoy dinner parties both at his city house and his country seat in Mulmar, northwest of Toronto. (Mr. Rahimi was impressed at how smoothly Mr. Thorsell one night smoothly served grilled lamb for 12 at the country home, "everything at the right time.") And yet Mr. Thorsell has never taken a partner. "People say, 'Why don't you have a dog?' Mr. Thorsell muses. "I say, 'because a dog is not a thing. It's a being. And I'm out six nights a week."</p>
<p>The ROM opened the Michael Lee-Chin Crystal a year late and about $100-million over budget -- $30-million of that "because of scope increase," Mr. Thorsell says. "We are looking for another $16-million to $18-million." Attendance topped 1 million last year; this year "we will probably beat that unless H1N1 shuts down the city."</p>
<p>After our lunch, I went back to look around the Crystal. "It's poorly done," a guide told me, adding that guests get lost. But he added, "Most of my friends who are very artistic shout me down regularly." (In the film, a top curator calls the place "dysfunctional.") I got lost in the new addition too. It is confusing and offers scant natural light. Mr. Thorsell calls the result, "a miracle" and remains close to the architect; he went to dinner last month with Nina and Daniel Libeskind when they came to the ROM's Ten Commandments display.</p>
<p>Mr. Thorsell certainly put the ROM on the map. The museum now has a busy evening schedule. On Wednesday, Mr. Thorsell moderated a debate between Bernard Landry, former Quebec premier, and military historian Jack Granatstein: "Was General Wolfe's victory on the Plains of Abraham good for New France?" It is inspired by the ROM's painting, "The Death of General Wolfe" (1776).</p>
<p>Perhaps panache is what Mr. Thorsell has most brought to Toronto. Noah Torno, philanthropist and former chairman of the ROM board, donated his Steinway to the museum upon his death, in 2004. Sitting at the Steinway during a memorial in the ROM's Glass Room, Mr. Thorsell played Somewhere Over The Rainbow and segued into I'll Be Seeing You.</p>
<p>At Pangaea, the waiter smoothes over and whisks away Mr. Thorsell's plate, on which he has left a sliver of heirloom carrot. "Eat your vegetables, young man," the waiter says. "I like the 'young man' part," Mr. Thorsell replies, ordering coffee.</p>

executive in August, says he is looking for his next project: "I'm

<p>As Canadians fuss over the slow rollout of H1N1 shots and highly publicized cases of queue-jumping, they can take solace in one generally overlooked fact: Most other industrialized countries have considerably less of the vaccine on hand.</p>
<p>Per capita, the United States has shipped barely half as much as Canada. Britain -- twice as populous as Canada -- has distributed about the same volume of vaccine as here, France even less. And yet those places are not seeing the same kind of controversy -- and saturation media coverage -- around the availability of vaccine as has Canada. The international comparisons beg the question: Why has Canada's vaccine program, one of the most efficient in the world, been enveloped in dispute and recrimination almost from the start?</p>
<p>Experts point to a high level of concern about the pandemic after the deaths of two children last month, triggering a surge in demand for immunization.</p>
<p>Canadians have also shown a greater acceptance of the vaccine than people in some nations, where fears of its side effects have trumped concern about the virus.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of anxiety ... and fear and threat," said Scott Schieman, a University of Toronto sociologist who studies health and social behaviour. "Public perception is already high; people are paying attention. So any detail or information, even if it's not accurate, is going to be amplified."</p>
<p>There is also evidence that the taint of scandal surrounding the program may be more media-generated than a reflection of widespread public unease. A Harris/Decima poll released this week suggests that most Canadians think their governments have done at least a fair job of handling the pandemic, while two-thirds believe the news media have overblown the crisis.</p>
<p>Prof. Shieman said he suspects the entire H1N1 situation has been overly "hyped." Some of the glitches in the campaign -- like those professional athletes, private-school students and hospital directors moving to the front of the flu-shot queue -- have to be put in context, he said. "Most people aren't jumping the line, most people aren't freaking out," he said. "That's the other side to the story: It's not that everything is becoming unhinged."</p>
<p>In fact, there is little evidence the queue-jumping has involved more than a relatively few opportunistic individuals, and poor decision-making by the public-health officials or doctors who administered the vaccine. Local Toronto media gave extensive coverage this week to the students at three private schools east of the city who were vaccinated by local physicians contrary to official policy, while people in priority groups -- not to mention public-school students -- were still waiting for a shot.</p>
<p>The York Region health department says the incidents were isolated, and at odds with the instructions it provides to doctors when it hands vaccine over to them. By the end of this week, Canada will have distributed 8.5 million doses of the vaccine -- out of 50 million ordered, according to the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p>
<p>There have undoubtedly been problems. Local health offices seemed slow in dispersing their first supplies of vaccine from the federal government, resulting in huge crowds lining up for hours to get their needle. A production delay sharply cut back shipments early in the pandemic's fall wave. Federal authorities have admitted they should have contracted with two manufacturers -- not one -- to ensure a more constant supply, though the single supplier is the result of a contract signed years ago.</p>
<p>In the United States, with 10 times the population, however, just 35 million doses have been shipped, the Centers for Disease Control website indicates.</p>
<p>The shortage south of the border was big news briefly in October, with some pundits even musing that the problems could backfire on the Obama White House. Since then, interest in the topic seems to have waned.</p>
<p>The words "flu" and "vaccine" appeared in just 10 stories in the Washington Post and 23 in The New York Times in the past two weeks -- only one of them making the front page. That compares with 36 articles in the National Post during the same period, 66 in The Globe and Mail, 72 in the Ottawa Citizen and 55 in the Vancouver Sun.</p>
<p>Polling data suggest a sizeable minority of Americans want the vaccine for themselves or their children and are frustrated by the shortage, said Gillian SteelFisher, assistant director of the Harvard School of Public Health's opinion research program. Ms. SteelFisher said she is unaware, however, of any survey results indicating the frustration has translated into broad discontent with the government.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, polls and the experience with seasonal flu immunization suggest that once the vaccine enthusiasts have obtained their shots, public-health authorities will actually be struggling to convince other people to get inoculated, with many unused doses likely to be left behind at the end, Ms. SteelFisher said.</p>
<p>In Canada, focus on vaccine supply has been so intense, the Public Health Agency is posting detailed updates on its website on how much the manufacturer, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, has delivered to the regions. In the U.K., on the other hand, a Health Department spokesman said it generally does not release such information even to the media.</p>
<p>---------</p>
<p>H1n1 Around The World</p>
<p>-About three-quarters of people in France still insist they have no plans to seek out a vaccine, polls suggest. France, having inoculated 100,000 of 800,000 health workers earlier, just started its public vaccination campaign on Thursday, with about six million doses available, for a population double Canada's. French media reported sparse attendance at the country's newly opened vaccination clinics.</p>
<p>-In Britain, the pandemic was a media hot potato in the spring but has made only a minor dent on the news landscape in recent weeks. "There will be a story in each paper, but it's not the front page. It's buried down there," said Connie St Louis, director of the science journalism program at London's City University. "It just bubbles below the surface because nobody is really worried about it in the way they were in the beginning."</p>
<p>-In Turkey, the Prime Minister advised against getting a flu shot, prompting criticism from health authorities.</p>
<p>-At least one country has experienced a similar yearning for vaccine -- and government response -- as Canada. Swedes have been lining up at vaccination clinics and about two million have received shots, roughly proportional to the amount delivered in Canada.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>November shaping up as deadliest month; Worst flu season in six years; Experts warn most Quebecers won't have been vaccinated until after peak</b>
</div><div>AARON DERFEL    </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>838 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette    </div>
</p>
<p>Less than two weeks in, November is already on record as the deadliest month for H1N1 infections in Canada since the flu pandemic erupted in late April, according to statistics released yesterday by public-health authorities.</p>
<p>The data suggest that the number of H1N1 infections in Quebec, along with the rest of Canada, has not yet peaked during this, the second wave of the pandemic. What's more, most Quebecers will probably not have received their vaccinations until after the peak, warn experts in infectious diseases.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization is reporting that this year's flu season in North America is the worst in the past six years.</p>
<p>"We're probably in the third or fourth week of the second wave, and the second wave is bigger than the first," said Karl Weiss, a microbiologist and physician at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital.</p>
<p>"It's a lot more widespread now geographically across Quebec than in the first wave, which was mostly in Montreal. We're seeing that although mortality is relatively low, there's a heavy trend in terms of morbidity - meaning hospitalization and stays in the intensive-care unit.</p>
<p>"I don't think we've reached the peak," Weiss added.</p>
<p>Mark Roper, co-director of a family medicine clinic at the Queen Elizabeth Health Complex, said he's noticed a surge in cases in the past few weeks.</p>
<p>"They're coming in all of a sudden," Roper said. "In our walk-in clinic, which is not even a flu clinic, we're seeing about 20 cases a day.</p>
<p>"We're seeing a lot of kids," he added. "But if they're not in the at-risk groups, we're sending them home and advising them to drink plenty of liquids and to take Tylenol."</p>
<p>A Gazette analysis of data by the Public Health Agency of Canada has found the number of deaths in the country peaked in July, with 34 deaths that month. Most of those who had died had been infected in May or June and had stayed in the ICU for weeks on respirators.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the agency has reported 66 deaths since Oct. 29. From Tuesday to Thursday, the death toll climbed by 26 deaths nationally.</p>
<p>Figures for Quebec show a similar trend. In fact, from Monday to Tuesday, the province reported 111 hospitalizations from H1N1. To put those figures into perspective, the province had reported a cumulative total of 923 hospitalizations from the swine flu since Aug. 30.</p>
<p>During the same two-day period, 16 Quebecers ended up in the ICU and three died. Of the total number of hospitalizations, only two individuals did not have underlying health problems.</p>
<p>This strongly suggests that most healthy people who fall ill from H1N1 will not need to be admitted to hospital.</p>
<p>(Quebec is reporting a higher death toll than the Public Health Agency. Since Aug. 30, the province said a total of 20 Quebecers have died from H1N1, while the Public Health Agency is reporting 10 deaths for the province.)</p>
<p>As the second wave picks up, the big question on the minds of epidemiologists is whether H1N1 is worse than a typical flu season. The answer to that question is far from clear, since authorities are no longer recording every case of H1N1 in the community.</p>
<p>Theresa Tam, director of the immunization and respiratory infections division of the Public Health Agency, has estimated that Canada's death toll from the seasonal flu ranges from 700 to 2,500 a year. Most of those deaths occur in the elderly.</p>
<p>An Ontario study found that in 2006-2007, 75 elderly people died of complications from confirmed influenza in long-term care centres.</p>
<p>The cumulative total of H1N1 deaths this year across Canada is 161.</p>
<p>Some experts have predicted that H1N1 will cause far more infections than the seasonal flu, but there will be fewer deaths than in most years. In addition, more children, teens and young adults are likely to fall ill from the flu this year than in the past.</p>
<p>In fact, 52 per cent of all hospitalizations in Quebec since Aug. 30 have occurred in individuals who are less than 29 years old.</p>
<p>To date, Quebec has vaccinated about one-seventh of the population. Weiss expressed concern that most Quebecers might not be vaccinated in time for the peak of the current wave.</p>
<p>"Since we're already three or four weeks in, are we too far into the wave to immunize everybody and to have an impact?" he asked.</p>
<p>"We have to immunize the high-risk categories as fast as possible. We might still have a small window of opportunity to reach our goal, but we have to act very fast."</p>

<p>All but the youngest children need only a single half-dose of H1N1 vaccine, federal health officials have decided - but Quebec hasn't made up its mind on the issue yet.</p>
<p>The provincial health department's decision is expected by Saturday, Horacio Arruda, director of the protection branch of the Quebec Public Health said yesterday.</p>
<p>Speaking at a briefing in Quebec City, Arruda said Quebec makes its own decisions.</p>
<p>But the delay will not compromise Quebec children who already got immunized with the first half dose, he said.</p>
<p>The decision will be made in time for children to get their half second dose within the required 21 days, Arruda said.</p>
<p>"As usual, our experts in Quebec always look at the same data, and at other data, and then make a recommendations to the medical director in Quebec. I'm not saying it's going to be the same or that it's going to be different, but we always follow that process for all our public immunization program."</p>
<p>Quebec health officials have already stated that a second dose is recommended for children under age 10 who have immune deficiencies.</p>
<p>"Those cases have been advised by nurses to come back within 21 days," Arruda said.</p>
<p>The federal decision means many parents of healthy children outside Quebec who have already endured hours waiting to have them vaccinated will not have to line up again for a second shot.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Bolduc: 'Better to do too much than too little'; Q & A with Quebec's health minister</b>
</div><div>CHARLIE FIDELMAN   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>961 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Quebec Health Minister Yves Bolduc yesterday answered questions from The Gazette about the provincial swine flu campaign, which seems to be adjusted on a weekly basis, advancing or dropping an age group from the vaccine priority. Bolduc spoke in French. The following is a translation.</p>
<p>Q: It's precisely such adjustments that suggest that the Health Department doesn't quite know what it is doing ...</p>
<p>A: No one on Earth could possibly handle a crisis of this size by foreseeing everything. The health teams' strength lies in their flexibility and ability to adjust as needed. When we compare ourselves with the rest of Canada - and we've heard echoes - it seems that the spot where it is working best is in Quebec.</p>
<p>Q: Why does it take up to two hours to get someone to answer the Info-Santé line?</p>
<p>A: There's been a lot of pressure at every level in the H1N1 file and we've tried to adjust as needed, adding more people to answer the phone, but it's such an important file that we're having difficulties responding to the demand in some areas. But we have a website that's easily accessible. It's the first time that the line and website have been used to such an extent. It's an encouraging sign showing that people really want to be informed.</p>
<p>Q: The swine flu virus killed 24 Quebecers in 21/2 months. Is this a real pandemic or a non-event that will cost Quebec $200 million?</p>
<p>A: It's the fourth pandemic since the Spanish flu of 1918, in 1957 it was the Asian flu, in 1968 the Hong Kong flu. It is a pandemic because it is reaching every corner of the planet and populations have little immunity. There have been deaths and there will be deaths. We have no way of knowing just how virulent it will be. And if today it was four times as deadly, people would be asking if we had done everything possible. We're not looking for high mortality, but we have to prepare for that. We are aiming at prevention. Better to do too much than too little.</p>
<p>Q: How do you respond to critics that suggest Quebec's mass vaccination plan is not "one plan" but dozens of different plans that vary according to each CSST or local health agency?</p>
<p>A: For a mass vaccination plan to succeed - immunizing the largest number possible as quickly as possible - we needed a decentralized plan united behind a national orientation or objective. Another important element, respect for local characteristics, that is, the Montreal area is organized differently than the Gaspésie. Success depends on the involvement of those on the ground, the people who know how best to proceed, also care for the sick, open clinics for swine flu complications, organize hospital and ICU care.</p>
<p>Q: How do you explain cancelling support groups, for example, for children grieving the suicide of a parent?</p>
<p>A: In a crisis situation we have to react to a crisis situation. It's possible these people were needed to handle H1N1 issues in other areas. We have to prioritize our activities.</p>
<p>Q: When it comes to immunizing Quebec's children, why not send a few teams of nurses into the schools rather than displace thousands of students to vaccine centres?</p>
<p>A: In 2001 during an outbreak of meningococcal disease, we had to vaccinate 1.7 million students and it took several months in the schools. The goal is to inoculate this clientele within three weeks - we don't have months - and it would be physically impossible to do so in the schools in a short period of time. Parents always have the option of taking their children to vaccine centres. We're offering both possibilities.</p>
<p>Q: What do you have to say to nurses who feel hurt by your remarks about vaccine privileges?</p>
<p>A: It was never my intention to attack the nurses. I think my comments were taken out of context. My comments were meant to explain specific cases. ...</p>
<p>Q: How do you respond to seniors and other critics that suggest Quebec may have erred in vaccine priorities?</p>
<p>A: We're open to all commentary. Some say we have to turn left, other say turn right, and once we turn right, they say we have to go left. Our objective is to move as fast as possible to protect as many people as possible. And only a vaccine will provide protection against the virus. Vaccine priorities were set according to epidemiological world data. I think people can understand that those most at risk should go first. The virus killed mostly young people and pregnant women in the first wave during the spring. When a 13-year-old boy died in Toronto, people asked, "Why aren't we vaccinating children?" Well, we are and before the general population.</p>
<p>Q: In hindsight, what would you have done differently?</p>
<p>A: This is the biggest mass vaccination we have ever done in Quebec. It's never been done before and we have to adjust gradually. We've come to realize that there are regional characteristics that we have to accept. And that it's the people on the ground who know best how to proceed. Some areas have had difficulties but you have to look at the total picture and how many areas functioned well. Look at your own region, don't bother with what is happening next door, because that's confusing. It's impossible in such a huge operation that everything will be exactly the same everywhere.</p>

<p>November is already on record as the deadliest month for H1N1 infections in Canada, according to data from public-health authorities. Aaron Derfel reports that the data suggest the number of H1N1 infections in Quebec has not yet peaked. Also, experts warn that most of us probably will not have received a vaccination until after the peak. Page A4</p>

<p>If tomorrow were MUHC Career Day, as scheduled, Dr. Shawn Cohen's story might have inspired a few recruits.</p>
<p>The event has been postponed because H1N1 concerns inhibit open houses at hospitals. But when the MUHC gets around to explaining its staffing needs, Cohen will supply a been there/ done that perspective.</p>
<p>The 41-year-old doctor learned how hospitals work when he was a teenager. Cohen was a porter, carrying blood, pushing gurneys around the Montreal General - and learning a few shortcuts.</p>
<p>"I liked it more than the massive Royal Vic," Cohen says, "because the Montreal General is finite. You can learn it like the back of your hand.</p>
<p>"I still know corridors no one else knows about. And I got to see all the different departments and decide what was best for me."</p>
<p>Cohen remembers great esprit de corps among the porters.</p>
<p>"There was never jealousy," he said. "I didn't see jealousy until I got into medicine."</p>
<p>After graduating from McGill's medical school, Cohen did a one-year fellowship at Duke University in North Carolina. He's an ophthalmologist who shares offices with three other specialists in the Drummond Medical Building and does cataract and glaucoma surgery in the familiar and cozy environment of the MGH.</p>
<p>Cohen traces his career path to an incident that occurred when he was 6 years old. He pulled his imperilled cousin out of a backyard swimming pool, decided then and there to become a lifeguard and then did enough studying to become a lifeguard writ large.</p>
<p>Cohen worked as a Montreal General porter when he was 18. It taught him, he recalls, "what medicine was about."</p>
<p>"If you want to know if you can tolerate blood, carry it around for a day," Cohen laughed. He still remembers and talks to staff he worked with when he was a porter, noting fondly, "Nobody ever seems to leave the General."</p>
<p>"They stay there forever," he said, "because they love the place."</p>
<p>As does Cohen. At Christmas, he distributes cards to the hospital's support staff, thanking them for essential contributions toward the care of his patients.</p>
<p>"We hope and strive for the intangibles," Cohen writes. "These are the feelings and needs for belonging, worthiness, respect, pride, satisfaction and a need to build a place where integrity, passion and emotional intelligence preside.</p>
<p>"How do we keep this alive? One patient at a time. One interaction at a time."</p>
<p>This isn't just Hallmark treacle. Cohen is a genuinely nice guy who's done a lot of public speaking (he'll be talking eye care at a Jewish General seminar on Monday) and bits for CJAD.</p>
<p>He introduced me to his office staff, describing each woman as a key team member. And I'd have liked Cohen even if he hadn't ingratiated himself by saying I was his wife's favourite Gazette columnist.</p>
<p>I'm big with wives, not to mention widows, so shout-out to Vicky Cohen for bringing the average age of the fan club down to 67. She and Cohen hooked up when he was a 16-year-old lifeguard.</p>
<p>"She was my first date ever," he recalls, "and I never dated again. That's the one I wanted. She's the best."</p>
<p>In lieu of a dating guide, Cohen has written I Care About Eye Care, a 23-page, large-format booklet that demystifies the arcana of opthalmology.</p>
<p>Cohen and I talked about Duke basketball, his infrequent golfing ("I shoot 70 ... for nine holes") and the vital role of support staff.</p>
<p>"I know what they go through," Cohen said. "I was there."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>New clinics help fight flu</b>
</div><div>By Johanna Weidner   </div>
<div>Record staff</div>
<div>763 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>People who feel they have the H1N1 flu and need help in treating it now have two places they can go.</p>
<p>Cambridge Memorial Hospital is today opening a flu assessment clinic to ease pressure on the emergency department, joining Grand River's special H1N1 clinic that opened earlier this week.</p>
<p>The clinics are intended to help people who don't feel well enough to care for themselves at home, can't get to a family doctor, or are not so seriously ill they require care in an emergency department.</p>
<p>"The people who come here are those that are not getting well or who have an illness that is getting worse," said Cambridge Memorial's interim chief of staff Dr. Michael Lawrie.</p>
<p>Local emergency departments have been swamped with people complaining of flu-like symptoms - the number of patients spiking as high as 40 per cent above an average day since the flu season began this fall.</p>
<p>"Our emergency department was just so crowded," said Cheryl MacInnes, director of quality and clinical support at Cambridge Memorial.</p>
<p>Emergency rooms are returning to normal levels, but a fair percentage of visitors are still coming in with flu symptoms, including headache, cough, fever, muscle aches and fatigue, sore throat, runny nose and loss of appetite.</p>
<p>The goal of the clinics is to get flu patients out of the emergency room - allowing staff to focus on serious cases - and into a separate area to prevent spread of the H1N1 flu virus, which is the predominant strain in Waterloo Region.</p>
<p>People will be assessed by a nurse practitioner for the severity of their illness, and given flu information and advice for treatment at home.</p>
<p>"They might just need reassurance," said Donna Lyle, infection control practitioner at Cambridge Memorial.</p>
<p>Vaccines will not be given and only patients with flu-like illness will be assessed. Those with serious complications, such as difficulty breathing, should go to the emergency department.</p>
<p>The clinic is a good test run for the hospital's pandemic plan, MacInnes said. Clinic days may be added depending on the demand, and what happens as the flu season continues.</p>
<p>"I think there is less panic, but I think there is still some concern," she said. And "no one is quite sure what the next two weeks will bring."</p>
<p>The assessment clinic at Cambridge Memorial opens today and goes to Tuesday from 3 to 8 p.m. at the back of the ambulatory care centre.</p>
<p>Grand River's assessment clinic opened on Tuesday in the emergency department and will run for two weeks, Monday to Friday from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
<p>There are flu assessment clinics across the province, with an average of 60 patients each day.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Grand River started sending patients with flu symptoms to a separate waiting area.</p>
<p>The clinic is the next step to that approach, said Lynne Julius, associate vice-president of acute care services.</p>
<p>She thinks the decline in the number of emergency room visits come from people being more comfortable about recovering from the flu at home knowing that most cases are mild to moderate.</p>
<p>"People are taking care of themselves at home and not feeling nervous about doing that," Julius said.</p>
<p>Guelph General Hospital opened a flu assessment clinic on Nov. 3 that now runs Monday to Friday from 2 to 8 p.m.</p>
<p>St. Mary's General Hospital considered opening one as emergency room visits spiked by upwards of 25 per cent over the last month, but in the last week there's been a gradual tapering off of emergency room patients.</p>
<p>"It still fluctuates, but it's nowhere near as busy as it was earlier," said Don Shilton, vice-president of patient services.</p>
<p>Patients coming into the emergency department are screened for flu-like symptoms and masks are available.</p>
<p>All area hospitals have been working closely together and with public health to deal with the flu season, Shilton said.</p>
<p>"It's very much a collaborative effort."</p>
<p>Cambridge Memorial urges people to follow these flu care guidelines:</p>
<p>Those who feel well enough should care for themselves at home. People may also call Telehealth for advice at 1-866-797-0000.</p>
<p>People with flu symptoms who think they need medical attention should call their family doctor first.</p>
<p>Those unable to visit a family doctor can go to a flu assessment clinic.</p>
<p>People having difficulty breathing, feeling delirious or thinking they are at high risk should go to an emergency department.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A nose rinse might be as good as a flu shot</b>

</p>
<p>H1N1 - to take it or not to take it - that is the question. I wonder what Hamlet would have done. I definitely have my opinions on vaccinations; however, I have always felt that it is a very personal decision that should be made by an informed person. Because this vaccination has played out like no other, it has become increasingly difficult to make an informed decision. Being faced with an expectation of a pandemic similar to the one that hit Mexico last spring, seeing body bags being delivered to native reserves, hearing the constant barrage of news releases from health officials urging everyone to roll up their sleeves, and experiencing hour-long lineups has resulted in a frenzy of panic and fear.</p>
<p>While we wait for our fix, let's take time to process the other information that comes our way. According to Health Canada (as reported on Canada AM) the H1N1 strain that is presently passing through our community is milder than originally anticipated.</p>
<p>It makes me wonder how much serum our government purchased and what expiry date it contains. It would certainly explain the further government expense of two-sided, glossy flyers which have recently been sent to homeowners urging them to get their shots.</p>
<p>With the tight economy and my ever-increasing taxes, I can only wonder about the number of dollars that have been spent on this aggressive campaign.</p>
<p>But, my penny pinching urges give way to my heart as I hear about the many deaths that have occurred due to this virus. Although I am not to worry too much (being old), my son is in the at-risk group. This sends me on another quest for information. As posted on the Public Health Agency of Canada's website, as of Nov. 5th , 115 people have died from H1N1 in this country. Furthermore, Wikipedia confirms that the population of Canada, as of Nov. 9th , is 33,838,000 people. You do the math (1 in 294,243). Ironically, my son may have a higher chance of getting a serious side effect from the shot (approximately 1 in 100,000), than from dying as a result of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>As a person who must weigh all sides before jumping head first into something, I still have a lot of questions. And unlike many trusting souls, I cannot take the word of someone just because they have the reputation to "know best." I believe that everyone is capable of knowing what is best for them by taking control of their health through knowledge, healthy eating and exercise.</p>
<p>Dr. Oz, a famous American surgeon, introduced me to the virus-fighting neti pot. Once a day I rinse my sinuses with lukewarm salt water (using the neti pot) and then I gargle. According to Dr. Oz, a virus (including H1N1) cannot live in a salt water environment and the only way a virus can enter your body is through the nose or mouth. I have used this protocol during the past month, when 15 out of my 26 students were experiencing flu symptoms. I have yet to get sick, or get the flu shot.</p>
<p>For me, for now, I'll stick with my salty nose rinse. It works. It's cheap. There are no side effects and I know what is in it.</p>
<p>After much coaxing and seeing how healthy I continue to be, my husband has finally started using the rinse.</p>
<p>However, my son is still weighing his options. At the end of the day, after all the conversation, it still comes down to a very personal decision.</p>
<p>Make it an informed one.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Canadians think governments have done OK on H1N1, but media overreacting: poll</b>
</div><div>Sheryl Ubelacker   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>382 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A5</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Opposition politicians and the media may be hammering governments for their handling of the H1N1 situation, but a new poll suggests most Canadians themselves feel their governments deserve a passing grade.</p>
<p>The media's coverage of H1N1 on the other hand - well, that doesn't earn much admiration.</p>
<p>The latest Canadian Press Harris-Decima survey found that overall, most respondents see all three levels of government as having done at least a fair job of preparing for, and dealing with, the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Almost one-quarter (22 to 24 per cent) of those surveyed said each level of government has done a good job dealing with H1N1 flu, while another third or more (33 to 37 per cent) describe their performance as at least fair.</p>
<p>However, about one-third of respondents graded the response of each level of government - municipal, provincial or territorial, and federal - as poor.</p>
<p>"Fundamentally, I can understand why 22 per cent to 24 per cent saying you've done a good job on something isn't really your best day," said Doug Anderson, senior vice-president of Harris-Decima.</p>
<p>"However, the complexity of the task and the fact that nothing like this has really ever been done, to me that says it's more like a passing grade," Anderson said from Ottawa. "But at the same time, I don't see this as collective criticism."</p>
<p>Still, not every government escaped the displeasure of its electorate.</p>
<p>Albertans were highly critical of the province's handling of the pandemic, with 61 per cent of respondents rating the performance as poor, the poll shows.</p>
<p>"The most significant (issue), I would say, was there was a controversy over the fact that the Calgary Flames hockey players and their families had been given the vaccine while others were finding it more difficult to get," said Anderson, noting that the anger was intensified when the province subsequently ran out of vaccine.</p>
<p>The survey of 1,000 people - considered accurate within 3.1 percentage points, 19 times out of 20 - also found that Canadians aged 18 to 34 are more impressed with governments' performance than those 50 and older.</p>
<p>The poll was conducted Nov. 5.</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>I normally receive my seasonal flu shot from my doctor's office, but in fall 2008 I was in Lime Ridge Mall so I lined up and received it there.</p>
<p>All that was required was a name, address and a question or two about allergies.</p>
<p>No OHIP number or other ID was required.</p>
<p>It occurred to me at that time that half the people in the line could be Americans taking advantage of our free flu vaccine.</p>
<p>I have now heard from people who have lined up to receive the H1N1 vaccine, as well as people in charge of moving those people along, that no OHIP number or other ID is required.</p>
<p>Could we be running low in Canada because we are supplying most of the border states? Shouldn't more than a name and possibly a fake address in town be required for this, as for any other medical procedure?</p>

<p>Re: H1N1</p>
<p>Instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on fancy advertisements regurgitating the basic facts of H1N1, perhaps the powers that be in the governments of Ontario and Canada should have spent that money ensuring there are enough vaccines for every Canadian.</p>
<p>It sickens me -- no pun intended -- to see multiple full-page ads in virtually every newspaper day- after-day, touting the signs and symptoms of H1N1, with no one to actually administer the vaccines to the general population until at least halfway through this month. Then to hear there may be vaccine shortages and that multimillionaire sports stars jumped the queue merely inflames the situation.</p>
<p>Surely this national scandal could have been averted by better allocating resources from "feel good" advertisements to simply producing the vaccines and hiring enough staff to distribute them in a timely and organized fashion?</p>
<p>Who is accountable for this disaster in the making?</p>
<p>Already a public inquiry seems to be in order, but how much for that?</p>

<p>Epidemic - Economic activity in Canada is unlikely to suffer a lasting blow from the H1N1 virus, even if it were to reach levels similar to the Spanish flu of 1918, says a study from TD Economics.</p>
<p>The study examines the possible impacts of the H1N1 virus by comparing absentee levels caused by illness and mortality recorded in the other pandemics experienced within the past 100 years in 1918, 1957 and 1968.</p>
<p>"All told," the study says, "a pandemic similar to those experienced in 1957 and 1968 would likely have a fairly limited impact on overall GDP growth.</p>
<p>"A more severe pandemic --more akin to the Spanish flu of 1918--would result in a more profound impact on economic activity, but even here the effects should prove to be short-lived," said economist James Marple.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Endend Of The World Movies; With the film 2012 based on the end of the Mayan calendar and, thus, the end of civilization as we know it, we look at other apocalyptic scenarios and the movies that showcase them</b>
</div><div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>530 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>C2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>Climate Change</p>
<p>All other apocalyptic scenarios are usually given a shrug, but with Al Gore leading a team of Hollywood elite in a bid to convince the world is warming at a rapid rate, people are taking notice. Out of all the possibilities, climate change is the most likely--at least that's what the movies tell us. - Movies: The Day After Tomorrow, Wall-E, An Inconvenient Truth</p>
<p>Asteroid</p>
<p>Chances of being hit by a giant space rock are, well, astronomical. But the possibility of being crushed to bits makes great theatre-- especially if the master of sap, Jerry Bruckheimer, can intertwine a love story into the plot. - Movies: Armageddon, Deep Impact</p>
<p>The Sun</p>
<p>It must be payback for taking our source of light for granted. We get mad at the sun for making us hot, for creating skin cancer and for sparking droughts. Now, the sun is dying and our opportunity to make nice and seek forgiveness has past. - Movies: Sunshine</p>
<p>Aliens</p>
<p>A perennial favourite of Hollywood, aliens have long been a force of fear for us earthlings. Maybe if aliens weren't made to look ugly and grotesque, but instead were portrayed as beautiful, maybe we'd be more open to occupation. - Movies: Aliens, Men in Black, Mars Attacks, Independence Day, War of the Worlds</p>
<p>Machines</p>
<p>It's always an ironic move by Hollywood to play out apocalyptic scenarios with machines that were created by humans to serve us. If such a scenario does play out, we can only hope it will look as cool as director-producer Michael Bay makes it appear. - Movies: Terminator, Transformers</p>
<p>Virus</p>
<p>Now that we're mired in worldwide fear of being infected by the H1N1 flu, we're hitting awfully close to home with this one. If a killer virus is eventually unleashed upon the world, we will have been so tired of the media crying wolf that it's unlikely we'll be prepared for the panic. Maybe we should put Alberta Health in charge . . . er, maybe not. - Movies: 12 Monkeys, 28 Days Later, I Am Legend</p>
<p>Nuclear War</p>
<p>During the height of the Cold War, nothing caused more strain on international relations than the prospect of nuclear annihilation. But those days are long gone, right? Russia is no longer flexing its muscles, Iran has only good intentions, the leader of North Korea is a restrained man and there is hardly any unrest in Pakistan, India and the rest of the Middle East . . . right? - Movies: Dr. Strangelove, TheDayAfter, Miracle Mile, Fail Safe</p>
<p>Evil</p>
<p>Nothing drives earthlings crazy like that pesky Evil. There's nothing worse than going about our business and every 5,000 years we have to drop everything, find the Fifth Element, and prevent Evil from extinguishing life. Thankfully, we have end-of-world favourite Bruce Willis to do the hard work for us. - Movies: Fifth Element</p>

<p>A panel of experts will review the care given to a B.C. woman who died with H1N1 after she was twice sent home from hospital.</p>
<p>Doctors sent Mae Mah, 51, of Richmond home twice in two days before admitting her again later on the second day, Nov. 1.</p>
<p>She died in hospital after going into cardiac arrest, according to news reports. Family members have complained the hospital that saw her, which has not been named, was negligent.</p>
<p>Maureen Malanchuk, spokeswoman for health authority Vancouver Coastal Health, said a review is standard procedure "whenever there is a situation like this, where there has been a fatality and there's been a couple of visits to the hospital."</p>
<p>She said a panel, including a senior physician, would review the patient's chart, her symptoms and what steps doctors recommended to her.</p>
<p>"The purpose of the review is to look at the care she was given and was it appropriate," Malanchuk said.</p>
<p>She said she would expect results of the review in a few days.</p>
<p>She said it's the first case she's aware of in which a patient with H1N1 died following a couple of outpatient visits to the hospital.</p>
<p>Dave Palen, identified by CTV as Mah's fiance, wouldn't comment on the incident. "We're going through enough torment right now," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pandemic taking its toll on blood donations; Donor cancellations, absenteeism adds up</b>

<p>Canada's blood donation system has taken a minor hit so far because of the H1N1 pandemic but Canadian Blood Services is bracing for a deeper impact as the flu season wears on and the number of donors could drop.</p>
<p>Ron Vezina, director of media relations for Canadian Blood Services, says the agency is still meeting demand from hospitals for blood and there is no cause for great concern at this point. The agency however, is trying to build its inventory to mitigate the threat posed to it by high donor, volunteer and staff absenteeism in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"From our point of view, it's [an issue] of supply. That's why we want to ramp up before great numbers of people start getting sick," he said in an interview.</p>
<p>While Vezina said CBS is "still in good shape," there has been "an operational impact."</p>
<p>The charitable organization that manages the country's blood supply system is made up 4,000 staff and relies on 17,000 volunteers to operate 19,000 mobile donor clinics every year and the 41 permanent collection sites.</p>
<p>That's a substantial workforce and like any employer, Canadian Blood Services has had to prepare for volunteer and staff absenteeism. The work CBS is engaged in however, is a life-and-death matter and it acknowledges that absenteeism could affect its ability to collect, test, process and distribute blood.</p>
<p>Some mobile clinics at schools, community centres, office buildings and at other public places were bumped in recent weeks because the facilities were needed for H1N1 vaccination clinics. Staff scrambled to find other locations if they could and urged donors who had booked appointments to come to the new location.</p>
<p>"We've seen some clinics that have underperformed," Vezina added, and they've seen an increased number of cancelled appointments over the last six weeks. The CBS estimates that about 700 appointments per week have been cancelled or the donor didn't show up.</p>

<p>Re: Property taxes fund municipal high rollers, Nov. 9</p>
<p>In relation to obscenely high industrial tax rates imposed by municipalities, Maureen Bader has the fond hope that the province will step in "to cap residential property tax rates at current levels and equalize other rates to the residential rate over a 10-year period."</p>
<p>Why she thinks the worst provincial government in living memory will do that is a puzzle. Meanwhile, thanks to the media, the citizenry appears focused on swine flu mania and hype for the Olympics. In addition, it looks as if BC Hydro president Bob Elton is being forced out for not endorsing the province's witless, costly energy policy instead of building the Site C dam and maintaining the Burrard Thermal plant for 24/7 availability.</p>
<p>In short, big issues such as the de-industrialization of the province and the long-term security of the electrical energy supply are largely being ignored.</p>

</p>
<p>One week after complete respiratory failure prompted doctors to put Jaclyn Bates, 27, into a medically induced coma while she battled the H1N1 flu, the Calgary mother of two young children appears to be slowly recovering.</p>
<p>"She's improving," Rob Pearce, Bates' fiance, said Thursday. "That's the most important thing. . . .</p>
<p>"She hasn't woken up yet. They had to put her back on sedatives Wednesday night . . . she was agitated."</p>
<p>Pearce, who just days ago was told by health officials to prepare for the chance Bates might die, called her condition a miracle.</p>
<p>"It's going to be a slow recovery so they are telling me to be patient."</p>
<p>The fast deterioration of the Calgary mother was shocking, said Pearce.</p>
<p>"She's the epitome of health," he said. "She just went from being perfectly healthy to ridiculously sick in a very short period of time and the doctors aren't even sure why."</p>
<p>Pearce said doctors at Rockyview General Hospital put Bates in an induced coma on Nov. 4 because she couldn't breathe on her own and doctors wanted to control her lung functions. "She had complete respiratory failure."</p>
<p>Bates has slowly improved while in the coma and is starting to breathe on her own again, but remains on a ventilator.</p>
<p>Citing privacy laws, a spokesman for Alberta Health Services said he couldn't comment on the case.</p>
<p>Though rare, other Canadians have also been put into medically induced comas after being diagnosed with H1N1.</p>
<p>Cases include a Nanaimo man, 41, who was placed in an induced coma after his kidneys shut down, and a Montreal woman, 23, who died after being put into an induced coma after giving birth to a son in June.</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency of Canada has reported 161 H1N1 deaths nationally.</p>

<p>The easiest way to expose oneself to public shame in Canada these days is to get the H1N1 vaccine without being in a priority group.</p>
<p>It started with people standing in line at clinics who didn't have medical conditions. Now, it seems every day there's a new scandal about the rich or powerful having access that the rest of us don't. Professional athletes, hospital donors, even students in private boarding schools seem to have no trouble getting the shot. Alberta has had to delay access for some people in priority groups, while the Calgary Flames players and staff, and even their families, got a special clinic all to themselves.</p>
<p>This touches a peculiarly Canadian nerve. In this country, it is an article of faith that access to health care has nothing to do with money or social standing. Of course, that's not true, but it's something we like to believe. Combine that with the fact that this flu is a little scary, especially for people in priority groups, and the fact that a very visible rise in cases coincided with a somewhat bumpy start to the vaccination campaign, and it's no wonder people are mad.</p>
<p>There have indeed been real ethical lapses. The queue-jumpers themselves are in many cases embarrassed, but they didn't do it on their own. They didn't trick doctors and health authorities into giving them the vaccine. If they got the shot, it's because someone in the medical system allowed them to get it.</p>
<p>British Columbia's chief medical officer even approved 300 doses for Olympic torchbearers. There have been enough of these incidents now to suggest that some doctors and officials are making up their own rules on the fly, without looking at the national picture or all the evidence. That undermines Canada's ability to mount a coherent response to any pandemic. If the next one is more serious, the consequences of rogue medical decisions could be too.</p>
<p>It's even more insulting when queue-jumpers and their doctors try to rationalize their choices. For example, the boarding schools say their students' close quarters make infections likely to spread. That's true, but it's true of all kinds of other populations too, such as university students who live in residence, or amateur sports teams who travel to tournaments.</p>
<p>Most people have some reason for getting the shot as soon as possible -- maybe they live or work with someone who's vulnerable, maybe they're travelling soon -- but the health professionals who dole out the vaccine should follow the list of priority groups that their provinces have approved.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that these few cases involving the rich and powerful have actually made a significant dent in the amount of vaccine available to high-risk groups this time around. Some people, including Canada's health minister, are upset at the prospect of Afghan detainees receiving the vaccine, but there is as yet no evidence that that would significantly affect the amount of vaccine available in Canada either. And it might be that the Geneva Conventions leave us no choice but to offer detainees the same basic medical treatment our soldiers are receiving.</p>
<p>The queue-jumping saga should provide Canada with valuable lessons for its next emergency. But it's easy for public shaming to go too far. It's important that Canadians keep a little perspective. H1N1 queue-jumping is maddening, but in the end it probably represents a smaller threat to the common good than driving while talking on the phone, or any of the other dozen or so offenses against good manners and public safety that occur on a daily basis.</p>

<p>All but the youngest children need only a single half-dose of H1N1 vaccine, federal health officials have decided, which means many parents of healthy children who have already endured waits hours long to have them vaccinated will not have to line up again for a second shot.</p>
<p>The new recommendations for vaccine dosing for children between three and nine years of age will free up vaccine and make more shots available to the general public sooner, officials say.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has created new guidelines that could push wider use of flu drugs in children and adults to keep H1N1 infections from becoming more severe.</p>

</div><div>Shelley Page   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>761 words</div><div>13 November 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>A "brilliant" 38-year-old University of Ottawa chemistry professor whose "trajectory of scientific success is second to none in Canada" has died of suspected H1N1.</p>
<p>Keith Fagnou died Wednesday in the intensive care unit at The Ottawa Hospital, three days after he was admitted. He had no known underlying medical conditions, according to Ottawa Public Health.</p>
<p>Fagnou, a father of three young children, was married to Dr. Danielle Gervais-Fagnou, a family doctor with the University of Ottawa's health services clinic.</p>
<p>This is Ottawa's fourth H1N1-related death since Sept. 1.</p>
<p>Fagnou's former PhD supervisor said in an interview that the death would change the way we look at the threat of H1N1. "Everybody thinks it will happen to someone else, somebody who has some kind of additional illness," said Mark Lautens, a professor from the University of Toronto, where Fagnou did his doctorate.</p>
<p>"Keith was a seemingly healthy person who got very sick, very fast. As soon as I heard the news I felt sick to my stomach, and then I thought, this is going to change the way we look at this kind of disease," Lautens said.</p>
<p>"We think it's someone in the high-risk groups. But here is someone who is healthy and vibrant, who is active and doing the right sorts of things and who took care of himself. And not only that, his wife is a doctor."</p>
<p>Lautens said the death of his former student has shaken the scientific community. "I've had e-mails from China, Harvard, all over the U.S., France."</p>
<p>The University of Ottawa released a statement late Thursday mourning the loss of the gifted researcher and professor, who was the University Research Chair in novel catalytic transformations.</p>
<p>His research group focused on improving the preparation of complex molecules for petrochemical, pharmaceutical or industrial uses. The program is part of the "green chemistry" movement aimed at searching for more efficient chemical processes to help the environment.</p>
<p>Fagnou joined the University of Ottawa's faculty of science in 2002 and won several prestigious awards including the Polyani Prize in 2003, the Governor General's Gold Medal and the Premier's Research Excellence Award.</p>
<p>Most recently Fagnou became the first Canadian to win the OMCOS award in organometallic chemistry. The award is presented every two years to a scientist under 40 in recognition of outstanding research contributions in that field.</p>
<p>Fagnou actually began his career in the military, before becoming a high school teacher in Saskatoon.</p>
<p>Lautens recalled how Fagnou came to him as a young teacher from Saskatchewan who realized he had a passion for chemistry. He moved to Toronto to take advanced-level chemistry courses.</p>
<p>"He came into my office one day and asked if I would hire him as a summer research student." Usually summer students' salaries are paid using their scholarships, but Fagnou's situation was a bit different. "He had already finished his degree and he wasn't really eligible for those scholarships."</p>
<p>Lautens took a calculated risk and paid Fagnou's salary. "That turned out to be a very smart decision on my part," adding, "He was very creative and very observant. He would find results that were unexpected."</p>
<p>"He was the most prolific student I think who has ever worked with me in 25 years." He and Fagnou published as many as 10 papers together.</p>
<p>Once Fagnou completed his PhD he was hired immediately by the University of Ottawa. "Now almost everybody everywhere goes and does post-doctoral work, but he went straight to the University of Ottawa and that was very very unusual."</p>
<p>Lautens recalled how Fagnou would hold "ABBA Fridays" in his lab and play music by the Swedish rock band all day long.</p>
<p>"He had that quintessential Canadian modesty, despite his great success. His trajectory of scientific success is second to none in Canada. He was winning all the top awards, getting all the best students, getting invitations to present all over." Lautens recalled, though, how his former student had his priorities right. He turned down one recent request to speak because he didn't want to miss trick-or-treating with his children.</p>

<p>Re: "Save the teachers" (Letters, Nov. 11).</p>
<p>Health-care professionals run the risk of contracting not just H1N1 but many other viruses with each patient they attend to, which justifies their high priority. With the current doctor shortage, do we really want fewer of them in a health crisis?</p>
<p>If parents do their jobs and keep their kids at home when they're sick or showing symptoms, teachers have a significantly lower chance of contracting H1N1.</p>
<p>As for the remark, "Teachers take care of other people's children daily, so that parents can be liberated to go to work": Where have I been? I thought we sent them to school to give them an education.</p>

<p>It appears neither the recession nor the swine flu will play Scrooge to gift shopping this year, judging by Quebec consumers polled recently about their planned buying behaviour for the holidays.</p>
<p>"Despite the difficult economic situation we are currently going through, and the risks associated with the influenza pandemic, the results of this survey are encouraging. They allow us to conclude consumers will be spending during the holiday season this year," Gaston Lafleur, president of the Retail Council of Quebec, told reporters yesterday in presenting the results of the annual assessment.</p>
<p>Based on information gathered by retail researcher Altus Géocom, which phoned 1,003 people between Oct. 22 and Nov. 3, Lafleur said, his group estimates Quebecers will spend more than $2.15 billion over the holiday period - the same amount as last year.</p>
<p>Sixty-three per cent of respondents (up from 60 per cent in 2008) said economic conditions will have little or no influence on their holiday spending, while 32 per cent stated their financial situation affects their decision whether to purchase a gift.</p>
<p>A Quebec household expects to spend $637 this season, on average, compared with $644 one year ago; of this year's amount, 58 per cent (about $370) is destined for gifts and the remainder is to be spent on receptions, meals and beverages.</p>
<p>Total household spending has been shrinking since 2006, when a typical household was projected to spend $711 for the holidays, Lafleur noted. The amount dropped to $681 in 2007 and $644 last year.</p>
<p>Although households are expected to spend less this year, he said, there are more households to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Altus Géocom, using information from census figures and housing starts, estimates there are 50,000 to 60,000 new households this year.</p>
<p>There was good news for mall retailers, as 58 per cent of poll respondents said shopping centres are their preferred gift-buying sites.</p>
<p>Forty-two per cent of respondents (down from 43 per cent in 2008) expect to give gift certificates and 10 per cent (up one percentage point from last year) will purchase a gift on the Internet.</p>
<p>Toys, educational games, books, magazines, gift certificates, apparel and fashion accessories, as well as CDs and DVDs, are on the majority of shopping lists this season.</p>
<p>Under the circumstances, Lafleur qualified the results as "comforting."</p>
