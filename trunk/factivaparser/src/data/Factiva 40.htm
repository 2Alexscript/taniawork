<p>The study by Danuta Skowronski and Gaston De Serres concerning the association between H1N1 infection and previous immunizations for seasonal flu is far from convincing (‘Epidemic Of Confusion' As Flu Strategies Diverge – front page, Oct. 1). A small number of subjects (1,500) were studied. Of these, only individuals under 50 (number unspecified) putatively experienced an increased risk for H1N1 after receiving the seasonal flu vaccine.</p>
<p>A number of potential confounders are apparent. Individuals who elect to be vaccinated for seasonal flu (health-care providers, for instance) are those most likely to be in contact with infected individuals for H1N1. Also, it must be noted that scientists in Australia, the U.S. and Britain failed to find any such link in similar populations.</p>
<p>The rationale to withhold release of the complete Skowronski-De Serres study is unacceptable. As a scientist, I believe the potential public health value of the information for epidemiologists involved in the analysis of respective risks presented by H1N1 and the seasonal flu supersedes the value of independent peer review of this work.</p>

</p>
<p>Summer is behind us now and the fall flu season is about to begin. The H1N1 flu strain is waiting in the wings and we're waiting to see how it all works out.</p>
<p>Signs are starting to show already.</p>
<p>Last spring and during the summer, H1N1 had an impact in northern Manitoba. Now it is being felt in such diverse places as the Ahousat band on Vancouver Island and the Dehcho First Nation in the Northwest Territories.</p>
<p>So, can we expect First Nations people to be harder hit than the rest of the country? If history is any indicator, the answer is yes.</p>
<p>The 1918 flu pandemic took a terrible toll on our people. The First Nations population of Canada dropped to around 100,000 after that pandemic. Communities that had been hit hard by smallpox and other diseases were greatly reduced and, in some cases, ceased to exist. The early indications are that, once gain, we will bear the brunt of this pandemic.</p>
<p>The reason is simple. Our people live in crowded, unsanitary conditions. Our more remote communities that lack basic infrastructure have been hit the hardest. Ground zero for the pandemic may well be aboriginal communities, not the cities.</p>
<p>One theory making the rounds suggests that aboriginal people are more susceptible to diseases that are foreign to Canada. This may have been true in the past, but most aboriginal people today are descendants of those who survived foreign-introduced diseases and our immune systems should be up to the task.</p>
<p>The difference lies with our living conditions. Poverty breeds disease. Overcrowded and poor quality housing, and a lack of proper sewer and water services all combine to provide the H1N1 virus with a welcome environment.</p>
<p>The federal government's response has been hit and miss. Bone-headed moves such as the refusal to send hand sanitizers to some northern communities because of the alcohol content of these products, and the infamous body bag issue have tried the patience of our leaders and are just plain stupid and bad PR.</p>
<p>The federal government so far has spent five times more on ads that promote its economic plan than it has on an H1N1 information program. These days in Ottawa, it's all politics, all the time.</p>
<p>The recent announcement by the health minister that she'll work with the Assembly of First Nations and increase communications between the First Nations and the Health ministry is a positive step.</p>
<p>Health is among issues that are a jurisdictional minefield for our people. Under the British North America Act, health care is a provincial responsibility, but the same act designates "Indians and lands reserves for Indians" as a federal responsibility. The result has been that the health care portion has been transferred to provincial medicare programs, but much of the preventive health measures on reserves and health education functions remain with Ottawa.</p>
<p>Therefore, if and when the H1N1 flu pandemic hits, the provinces will care for the patients in the hospitals, while the on-reserve response remains up to the federal government.</p>
<p>Too often the jurisdictions are confused, and there is either overlap or a vacuum. The latter is more often the case.</p>
<p>The First Nations relationship with Canada is contained in the treaties. In Treaty 6 and subsequent treaties, a clause was negotiated and inserted that calls for a "medicine chest" to be kept on each reserve for "the use and benefit of the Indian people." This medicine chest clause has been interpreted by our elders as meaning universal medical care. Today all Canadians receive health care, which is delivered by the provincial medicare programs.</p>
<p>However we need the federal government to step up to the plate and deliver the health-care program on reserves. Health care is not just treatment but prevention.</p>
<p>However, the federal infrastructure programs have bypassed many of the aboriginal communities that need it the worst. There now is a feeding frenzy elsewhere for the infrastructure dollars. Funds are being dispersed across Canada and the federal government is making as much political hay as it can.</p>
<p>Minority governments are famously short-sighted as they fight for survival and the next election, which may come at any moment. This does not bode well for our communities, which need long-term planning and serious improvements in infrastructure.</p>
<p>In a few months the H1N1 threat will be over, but the diseases of poverty will remain in the First Nations and aboriginal communities. We have other epidemics -- with diabetes, AIDS, drug and alcohol abuse running rampant in Indian Country. The rest of the world may move on, but for us the crisis will continue.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Handwashing key in flu control</b>
</div><div>Jacqueline Harden   </div>
<div>The Windsor Star</div>

</p>
<p>While your editorial, Flu control, Sept. 28, correctly identifies the importance of handwashing to prevent the spread of disease, it may confuse patients if certain inaccuracies are not addressed.</p>
<p>The statement from the Public Health Agency of Canada's website that people have no natural immunity to the H1N1 virus is questionable since the Ontario Ministry of Health has identified that Ontarians born before 1957 appear less susceptible to the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>For this reason, Ontario is providing a seasonal flu vaccine to people over the age of 65 in October, followed by the H1N1 vaccine to the general population, hopefully in November.</p>
<p>Second, it is important to recognize that the 2009 Global Hygiene Survey gathered information regarding hygiene practices from 10 countries. While the finding that 60 per cent of respondents were unaware that handwashing can prevent the flu is concerning, a different survey by the Hygiene Council found 74 per cent of Canadians understand that regular handwashing is critical to reducing the spread of germs. Increasing awareness of the importance of handwashing remains important, but translating this knowledge into action is the greater challenge for Canadians.</p>

<p>Public health officials issued a call yesterday for at-risk Canadians to consider getting another flu-related vaccine this fall, this one to protect them from the bacteria that causes common complications of the seasonal and H1N1 flu viruses.</p>
<p>Pneumococcus is the bacteria responsible for pneumonia, sinusitis, meningitis, bronchitis and other illnesses and infections that most often surface in very young children, the elderly and certain high-risk groups. They commonly coincide with influenza viruses.</p>
<p>A report released yesterday in the United States by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed that nearly one-third of 77 patients who died from H1N1 had a co-infection with pneumococcus and that it likely contributed to their death. The CDC said the findings underscore the importance of pneumococcal vaccination for those at increased risk of infection.</p>
<p>There are two types of pneumococcal vaccines available in Canada. One is recommended for children under two years old and for children up to five years old who are considered high-risk. The other is recommended for everyone else with a higher risk of disease, including those with compromised immune systems or diabetes.</p>

patients who died from H1N1 also had a pneumococcal disease.

<p>Six new ventilators installed in the intensive-care units of Victoria General and Royal Jubilee hospitals -- expected to play a critical role in the response to the H1N1 flu virus -- are the subject of the Victoria Hospitals Foundation's fall fundraising campaign.</p>
<p>The foundation is attempting to raise $375,000 to pay for the machines, which help patients breathe.</p>
<p>Health officials have said that experience in New Zealand and Australia -- where the flu season arrives earlier -- has shown intensive-care units were hardest hit during the onset of H1N1.</p>
<p>Dr. Gordon Wood, site chief for intensive-care medicine for the Vancouver Island Health Authority, said intensive-care units here are now stocked with about 50 ventilators.</p>
<p>Older models are being readied as a backup, and others from areas such as post-operative wards could be pressed into service by postponing some surgeries if necessary.</p>
<p>"We don't expect ventilators are going to be a limit to our ability to handle this," said Wood, who praised the new models, which respond to a patient's own lung action, increasing or decreasing the air pumped in, depending on demand.</p>
<p>Older machines, in contrast, force regular blasts of air into the lungs, an uncomfortable process requiring sedation.</p>
<p>The newer models allow patients to remain awake, shift and even get up and stand beside a bed while attached to the ventilator. That movement results in quicker recovery, freeing up beds to keep ahead of the pandemic.</p>
<p>The new strain of H1N1 flu first surfaced in B.C. in April, shortly after its appearance in Mexico. In June 2009, the World Health Organization pronounced it a pandemic, meaning the disease was now spreading easily between people around the world.</p>
<p>Despite its rapid rise to pandemic status, the disease has so far mostly proven to be little more serious than regular, seasonal flu.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, on Sept. 16, a woman from the Beecher Bay Reserve with underlying health conditions died from the disease, the sixth H1N1 death in the province since April.</p>
<p>B.C. public-health officials report a total of 52 patients with confirmed H1N1 have been admitted to hospital in the province since April.</p>
<p>To donate money for the new ventilators, call the foundation at 250-414-6688 or go to www.victoriahf.ca[http://www.victoriahf.ca] or contribute by mail at #602-620 View St. Victoria, B.C. V8W 1J6.</p>
<p>The Victoria Hospitals Foundation funds about 40 per cent of the equipment purchases at the Victoria General and Royal Jubilee hospitals every year, raising more than $70 million since 1989.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- On a day when the Liberals intend to put the alleged failings of the Conservative government in the spotlight, it's their own political miscues that are dominating the headlines.</p>
<p>This wasn't the script the Liberals had written for themselves back in August.</p>
<p>That's when Michael Ignatieff used a caucus retreat in Sudbury to declare that the opposition would no longer support the minority Conservative government.</p>
<p>"Mr. Harper, your time is up," the party leader said on Sept. 1.</p>
<p>Yet the ensuing weeks have been tougher on Liberals than Conservatives as a new ad campaign fails to move voters, there's public resistance to the election they're trying to force and now a blow-up among party organizers in Quebec.</p>
<p>"We haven't been able to get a good headline since August," lamented one Liberal MP this week, highlighting the feeling that the party has been spinning its wheels and, in the case of Quebec, seeing them come off completely.</p>
<p>Liberal MP Denis Coderre resigned as the party's Quebec lieutenant after he was overruled in a nomination dispute involving former justice minister Martin Cauchon.</p>
<p>How Ignatieff handles this crisis will be crucial for his political aspirations, pollster Nik Nanos said.</p>
<p>"It's pretty clear he has to control and manage this and that it's a test of his political leadership," Nanos said Wednesday.</p>
<p>He said most voters see Ignatieff as intelligent and thoughtful, but the question is whether he has the political instincts to lead the party and the nation.</p>
<p>"The reality is to sit in the prime minister's chair, one thing that's mandatory are political instincts."</p>
<p>Liberal MPs have rallied behind Ignatieff this week, portraying the Quebec dispute as a hiccup that won't dissuade them from their new-found desire to force the Conservatives from office.</p>
<p>"What's happened has not been particularly helpful. But it's not been fatal. It certainly isn't going to knock us off our game," said Liberal MP David McGuinty (Ottawa South).</p>
<p>That's why Thursday afternoon, Ignatieff and other Liberals will try to put the focus on the Conservatives, sponsoring a non-confidence vote the government is sure to survive thanks to the backing of the New Democrats.</p>
<p>In a speech before the late-afternoon vote, Ignatieff will highlight Conservative "mismanagement" of the economy, a deficit that has ballooned and health-care "crises" (the shortage of medical isotopes and H1N1 flu preparedness), a senior adviser said.</p>
<p>"He will fit as many reasons why we no longer have confidence in this government as possible into his 20 minutes," the adviser said.</p>

</p>
<p>The much-anticipated second wave of the swine flu virus has arrived in Ontario, a senior provincial health official says.</p>
<p>"What we've seen in the last few days is a number of cases that have come to emerg departments. ... It's announcing probably the second wave of H1N1," Dr. Don Low, head of the public health laboratories with the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion, said late Wednesday.</p>
<p>The flu activity is concentrated primarily in Toronto, Hamilton and London, he said. There have been very few cases of H1N1 in Ontario over the last several weeks, he noted. But on Monday, six new cases were confirmed.</p>
<p>Provincial labs have seen a sharp increase in influenza A cases, he said. While further testing will determine if these are the H1N1 strain, Low said it's expected that they are. Of all nasal swabs tested, the number that came back positive jumped to 14 per cent last Friday from 1 per cent earlier in the week.</p>
<p>"It's time to get everybody prepared and everybody to deal with it," Low said.</p>
<p>Canada's chief public health officer Dr. David Butler Jones told a media teleconference Wednesday that Canada will shield drug maker GalxoSmithKline from lawsuits in the event of problems with the vaccine, but not health practitioners who make mistakes in giving it.</p>

<p>For Philip Griebel, a new role at the University of Saskatchewan means the opportunity to work on a lifelong dream.</p>
<p>The professor in the university's school of public health, scientist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization's (VIDO) International Vaccine Centre and new Canada Research Chair in neonatal mucosal immunology says the title -- which comes with federal funding -- means he'll be able to focus his research on protecting sites on the body where disease can gain entrance inside of a human or animal.</p>
<p>StarPhoenix business reporter Cassandra Kyle asked Griebel five questions about his new post.</p>
<p>SP: In your new role as Canada Research Chair, what will the focus of your research be?</p>
<p>PG: The focus of my research will be on the interaction between disease-causing agents and either humans or animals at a very specific site in the body, which is the small intestine or the surfaces of the body that are an interface between the inside of the body and the environment.</p>
<p>SP: Do you think the public concern over the H1N1 virus is warranted?</p>
<p>PG: I think we always need to be concerned over infectious disease, but in dealing with infectious disease we have to ensure that the resources and the approaches we take to controlling that disease are the most effective approaches.</p>
<p>With the H1N1, which has been very debatable about the resources, that has been a very difficult question because we're trying to predict both the extent of this disease problem and the severity and those questions haven't been fully answered. When using a tool such as vaccines, often we can evaluate that much better when we know the real risk-benefit ratio and here that has been hard to define.</p>
<p>SP: What vaccination do you believe everyone should have?</p>
<p>PG: I think it's very important that the childhood vaccinations that we do now (continue) -- the very basic vaccinations have eliminated huge problems, the measles, mumps, rubella. We almost forget now about the risks of blindness and deafness that was associated with these diseases.</p>
<p>The very basic childhood vaccinations have eliminated huge problems. We almost see certain institutes, such as the Canadian Institute for the Blind, become much smaller partly because (they're) preventing many of the problems associated with childhood diseases.</p>
<p>SP: Do you have a personal research goal or milestone in vaccine research that you would like to meet?</p>
<p>PG: Yes, I do have a dream. I'm very interested in infectious agents that enter through these mucosal surfaces, these interfaces between the inside of our body and the environment. The most effective way to develop protection at those surfaces is to induce immune responses directly at those sites and our present vaccination that is given by injection either in the muscle or under the skin provides very poor protection at those surfaces.</p>
<p>So my dream is to actually develop effective vaccine delivery systems that would be able to protect these internal surfaces, and probably the most effective approach to that would be oral vaccination. Oral vaccination would be wonderful because it would eliminate the need for needles, which many people dislike a great deal when they're being vaccinated.</p>
<p>Also with the use of needles, there's a risk of disease transmission, blood-borne diseases such as HIV or hepatitis-C virus, so that would eliminate many of the risks and the pain associated with vaccine and provide much better protection.</p>
<p>SP: What does the future look like for vaccines?</p>
<p>PG: I think the future looks very positive in that there has been a great concern about the risk-benefit ratio with vaccines (and) we have very few adverse effects and a great many positive effects. I think with the way science is going in vaccine development we are defining vaccines and the components in vaccines much better all the time and we know more and more about how to apply vaccines to achieve disease protection.</p>
<p>And so I think with vaccines we will enhance disease protection even more in the future and reduce the risk of adverse reactions.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Babies in womb affected by 1918 flu outbreak: study; Heart disease more prevalent, men shorter</b>
</div><div>Sharon Kirkey </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>670 words</div><div>1 October 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen </div>
</p>
<p>Canada's original H1N1 epidemic -- back in 1918 -- affected babies in the womb, causing them to have higher rates of heart disease later in life, a new study shows.</p>
<p>As well, men exposed to the H1N1 strain in utero were slightly shorter than boys born months before or after the 1918 flu, a phenomenon suggesting growth retardation.</p>
<p>The findings, from researchers who looked at more than 100,000 people born in and around the lethal 1918-19 "Spanish flu" pandemic, searching for evidence of excess heart disease and other chronic illnesses, comes as major medical groups in Canada are urging pregnant women to get vaccinated against human swine flu.</p>
<p>"Prenatal exposure to even uncomplicated maternal influenza may have lasting consequences later in life," the researchers warn.</p>
<p>Today's H1N1 human swine flu is a distant cousin to the older strain. The 1918 flu was "notoriously virulent," sickening one-third of the United States across all age groups and killing about 0.6 per cent of the population, according to the study, published in the Journal of Developmental Origins of Health and Disease.</p>
<p>In Canada, the 1918 flu claimed up to 50,000 lives. Its deadliness came from bacterial co-infections that caused severe pneumonias, especially among pregnant women, the very group considered among those most at risk of developing severe H1N1 disease this fall and winter.</p>
<p>The 1918 flu "was far more lethal than any since," Caleb Finch, a professor of gerontology and biological sciences at the University of Southern California and senior author of the new study, said in a statement.</p>
<p>"Nonetheless, there is particular concern for the current swine flu, which seems to target pregnant women."</p>
<p>The 1918 flu first appeared in the spring, nearly vanished in the summer and then re-emerged with a vengeance during an October-December peak.</p>
<p>Earlier studies by some of the same researchers showed that babies born in the first part of 1919, after being exposed in the womb to the flu at its worst, had "development impairment or lifetime health issues."</p>
<p>The researchers wondered whether prenatal exposure to H1N1 could also accelerate chronic diseases of aging.</p>
<p>Their new analysis is based on U.S. National Health Interview Surveys of 101,068 people, born between 1915 and 1923, who were surveyed from 1982 to 1996. Researchers found a spike in heart disease rates for 1919 births. Men born in the first few months of 1919, who would have been exposed to H1N1 during the "hyper-virulent" wave in the fall of 1918 were more than 20 per cent more likely to have heart disease after the age of 60 compared to babies born with little or no prenatal exposure to influenza.</p>
<p>The effect of "cardiovascular aging" was strongest in men. Women born in the second quarter of 1919 were 17 per cent more likely to have heart disease than the general population later in life, but both sexes showed excess diabetes for births in 1919.</p>
<p>Next the researchers checked the height at Second World War army enlistment of 2.7 million men born between 1915 and 1922. The average height increased for each successive year, except for the period coinciding with in utero exposure to the flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Men born in 1919 were shorter by about 0.05 inches.</p>
<p>"It's a tiny bit shorter, but on a national population average, it's a very meaningful downward shift," Finch said in an interview. Height can be a marker for growth retardation, and growth retardation is associated with artery disease.</p>
<p>Exposure to influenza during pregnancy can trigger a stress response in the mother and unleash a "cytokine storm," an out-of-control, inflammatory response. "These have an impact on the fetus in a number of very complicated ways which affect development of the kidneys and other organs that later on create risk for hypertension and other precursors to cardiovascular disease," Finch said.</p>

<p>STONEY CREEK</p>
<p>More than a hundred students of St. Mark Catholic Elementary School stayed home yesterday after a confirmed outbreak of H1N1 influenza A.</p>
<p>The Stoney Creek school, home to 700 students, rallied additional resources and cleaning staff as it worked to disinfect toys, door handles and surfaces throughout the building.</p>
<p>"I think we've learned a lesson," said Principal Wendy Grabiec. "We've always emphasized handwashing with the kids but now they know why it's so important."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, one-third of the 57 students who were home sick yesterday from Columbia International College were expected to return to class this morning.</p>
<p>"There are no new cases and about a third of the cases have resolved from before," said Ron Rambarran, principal at the private university preparatory school. "They are asymptomatic, no more fevers, coughs and so on."</p>
<p>The city's public health unit confirmed a second outbreak of influenza A at Rambarran's school on Tuesday. Though the predominance of the swine flu strain makes it a likely culprit in the Columbia outbreak, officials are still awaiting test results from a Toronto lab.</p>
<p>No further confirmed cases of H1N1 had appeared in Hamilton schools yesterday, they added.</p>
<p>Despite the large numbers of student absences, it is impossible to say how many students are actually carrying the H1N1 bug, said Michelle Baird, the city's manager of infectious diseases.</p>
<p>"In order to declare an outbreak, we get confirmation of one case but there are other viruses circulating in the community too," she said. "It's really hard to differentiate what's flu and what's not without lab testing everyone."</p>
<p>Though Halton Region tested 45 patients in September, none have been positive for H1N1. The region recently launched a web-based surveillance system to track how many students have reported flu-like symptoms and will closely monitor schools with rates of more than 2 per cent.</p>
<p>About 12 per cent of Halton schools had rates of more than 2 per cent on Monday.</p>
<p>Though flu season doesn't usually begin until late October, health officials saw a number of H1N1 cases during the summer and anticipated some outbreaks once the school year began.</p>
<p>Symptoms include fever, cough and, sometimes, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Are you on Google's Wave VIP list? Web is abuzz with chatter about Google Wave, a new service in the early stages of user testing available to a lucky 100,000 people</b>
</div><div>Omar El Akkad </div>

</p>
<p>It's a testament to Google's buzz-generating power that the company managed on Thursday to whip up a storm of Internet chatter about a product that, technically, hasn't even launched yet.</p>
<p>The web giant began handing out 100,000 or so “invites” Thursday to its hugely ambitious, hugely anticipated new service, Google Wave. The invites allow users to take a look at Wave well before it launches publicly – probably next year.</p>
<p>Wave is best described as a real-time collaboration and communication tool. It lets users edit documents, chat and participate in all other manner of interactivity, all through a single piece of software. It is browser-based, meaning it can run on virtually any operating system. While Google incorporates several of its other services, such as Gmail, into Wave, the software's greatest strength will likely be the applications that third-party developers build for it.</p>
<p>Invites have become a common way for companies not only to pre-test their software before launching it to the masses, but also to build hype for a product that not everyone can get their hands on right away – the cyber-equivalent of a nightclub's VIP list. Google used invites with early versions of Gmail, and the public hype around Wave invites appears to be just as intense.</p>
<p>Within minutes of their release, invites began popping up on eBay for resale, fetching anywhere from $10 to more than $100, according to a scan of active bids Thursday. Wave became one of the most talked-about topics of the day on Twitter (alongside H1N1 flu and reality TV staple Jon Gosselin, among others), generating thousands of posts a minute, the vast majority from users looking to secure an invite.</p>
<p>Cyber-criminals also got in on the act, trying to lure users to malicious websites masquerading as Wave demo videos or sites offering invites.</p>
<p>Google's strategy with Wave appears to be similar to it's strategy for search, on-line advertising and a host of other markets: to place its product at the centre of an industry of communication and development. Wave is designed to harmonize all manner of communication into one platform, from e-mail to collaborative document-editing, from instant messaging to whatever applications third-party developers can dream up. If it succeeds, Wave may be to communication what Google itself is to search: a central hub of online activity.</p>
<p>But outside the 100,000 or so chosen ones, most people will have to wait a little longer to find out just what Wave is all about.</p>

<p>A Canadian pharmaceutical company believes a treatment for the H1N1 flu could be hiding in the arteries of people who caught the bug and recovered.</p>
<p>Cangene, a Winnipeg-based biotechnology company, is asking people who recovered from H1N1 infections to be part of a study into creating a new treatment for the flu.</p>
<p>Dr. Anand Kumar, an intensive-care specialist at the Health Sciences Centre, St. Boniface General Hospital and Grace Hospital, said he asked Cangene for help after feeling helpless treating the most serious patients during the first wave of H1N1 earlier this year.</p>
<p>At one point, Kumar said he had 40 patients being kept alive on ventilators.</p>
<p>"We had 40 people battling for their lives," he said. "It would have been nice to have this treatment."</p>
<p>As of Aug. 24, seven Manitobans had died, and there were 886 confirmed cases of H1N1. More than 300 of those with H1N1 were aboriginal.</p>
<p>Bill Bees, senior vice-president of operations with Cangene, said the study will assess whether the antibodies created in the blood to fight H1N1 can help other people.</p>
<p>"We're taking plasma, the liquid part of blood with antibodies, and from that, we would give the antibodies to patients in very great trouble," Bees said.</p>
<p>"This is an extra tool in the chest that doctors can pull out to help save lives."</p>
<p>Bees said how fast the substance will be available to help doctors depends on how fast donors sign up for the test.</p>
<p>"Ideally, we'd like to have some ready for the second wave of this flu," he said.</p>
<p>Kumar said the treatment won't have to undergo major testing before use, because it's just a variation of an immunoglobulin procedure done all the time.</p>
<p>He expects the treatment will be used on patients so sick, they are in the intensive-care unit after other interventions, including Tamiflu, have failed.</p>
<p>"I'm sure we will have lots of potential donors," he said.</p>
<p>The researchers are looking for people who are at least 18, in good health, weigh at least 50 kilograms, and pass a health-history screening.</p>
<p>Bees said compensation will be paid to qualified participants.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>China has stepped confidently onto world stage</b>

</p>
<p>What better way to celebrate a birthday than to take to the world stage? Last week, Hu Jintao became the first Chinese president to address the United Nations General Assembly, a privilege seemingly reserved for colourful despots such as Moammar Gadhafi.</p>
<p>The People's Republic, which turns 60 today, has evolved from tin-pot polity to powerhouse. And among the spectacular transformations China has undergone, its dramatic turnabout in how it relates to the world stands out.</p>
<p>China began as a pariah state, rejected by and hostile toward the world community. Marxism shaped its view of international organizations as the "instruments of capitalist imperialism and hegemonism," and for decades China had little to do with them.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to last week, when Hu proclaimed the "important role" of the United Nations and entreated the international community to "continue our joint endeavor to build a harmonious world of enduring peace and common prosperity."</p>
<p>Today, China has joined every major international organization for which it is eligible and signed more than 300 international treaties. It even has had a hand in creating new regional groups.</p>
<p>"They are acting like the new us," a U.S. official told me.</p>
<p>They prepare, send huge delegations to summits, and carefully cultivate diplomatic capital. And this is not just lip service. In many cases, China's engagement with global entities such as the World Trade Organization and the International Monetary Fund has prompted Beijing to bring its conduct in line with international standards.</p>
<p>The next step, though, is an important one. Now that China is fully engaged and has earned considerable clout, what will it do? Will it increasingly abide by and support international standards? Could it eventually become a genuine leader for the global common good, with the risk and sacrifice that often entails?</p>
<p>Beijing sends mixed signals. On the hopeful side, we see China's leadership on the North Korean nuclear issue-playing host to many rounds of the six-party talks, producing draft agreements and now, for the first time, enforcing UN sanctions against its nominal ally. And although it once objected to the whole idea, China now has 2,000 of its citizens in UN peacekeeping operations.</p>
<p>China also has done an about-face since the 2003 SARS debacle, when it covered up the outbreak and deceived international health officials. This time, it is sponsoring international conferences on swine flu and vaccinating millions of its people. In the economic realm, the stimulus package Beijing enacted in response to the global meltdown was huge-exactly the scale that the IMF and the U.S. recommended.</p>
<p>Of course, every nation acts in its own interests, but in all these cases, China also promotes the broader safety and prosperity of the world.</p>
<p>However, other areas show the zero-sum side of China's international engagement. On climate change, China is one big bump in the road on the way to a binding treaty at the Copenhagen summit in December. Thankfully-as it is now the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide-Beijing is going gangbusters on efficiency standards and renewables. But unless those domestic ambitions can be turned into specific and verifiable international commitments, there will be no deal, and the world will continue toward climate calamity.</p>
<p>Also, China's human-rights conduct does not live up to international standards, and, often to ensure access to natural resources, it supports and shelters dictators who abuse their people. Its concerted efforts at industrial espionage undermine international law, and its no-strings-attached development assistance, while doing some good, is setting back anti-corruption efforts.</p>
<p>The Chinese say it is unfair to expect a still-developing China to shoulder so much international responsibility. But the forces of globalization that made China the major power it is today are the same ones breeding threats that only nations acting in concert can address.</p>

</p>
<p>My 12-year-old daughter came home from school the other day with a little Band-Aid on her shoulder.</p>
<p>"What's that?" I asked. "A nicotine patch? I hope you've learned a lesson. Smoking is bad for you, not to mention what it does to the cigarette."</p>
<p>She wasn't in the mood. She knew that I knew she had had her hepatitis B shot. She fretted about it for a whole week.</p>
<p>I had tried to allay her fears. "Think of it as a kind of playful Punch Buggy, no vacc back, but with a needle instead of a fist, and no actual Volkswagen, unless someone's brakes fail and they drive their Beetle through the clinic wall."</p>
<p>(Then, naturally, I started to muse about what mechanism it is in the human brain that compels us, generation after generation, to punch each other's shoulders at the sighting of certain agreed- upon cars, then quickly plead immunity from reprisal with a safe-phrase like "no returners.")</p>
<p>Ruby is also scheduled to have a shot of meningococcal vaccine before she starts high school. In Grade 8, according to some health officials, she should have another vaccine to guard her against the human papillomavirus that causes cervical cancer.</p>
<p>On top of these, she may be encouraged to be inoculated against H1N1 in October, when the new vaccine is expected.</p>
<p>"Let's face it, kid," I told her. "You're basically a human dart board." She told me I was so not helping.</p>
<p>Even as I write this, various science-y type people are racing to develop something, anything, to jab into our bloodstream and arm us against H1N1, so that we can finally stop washing our hands like we're Howard Hughes after birthing a calf.</p>
<p>I'm reading panicky headlines that say such things as "What's your family's game plan against H1N1?" Game plan? We have to have a game plan? Like a strategy?</p>
<p>"Well, Brett, we've been working all week in practice on containing the viral envelope by moving the free safeties into the flats to cut off the quick post patterns and bringing the cornerbacks in a little tighter on the play and farther off the cheerleaders. Other than that, just a lot of washing our hands and not licking strangers near their mucous membranes.</p>
<p>"Gotta go, Brett. Team prayer. Hi, Mom!"</p>
<p>Game plan. I didn't even know what H1N1 stood for until I googled it. H1N1. Looks like letter values in Scrabble or a soccer score, Hotspur versus Nottingham.</p>
<p>In fact, the H and the N refer to the proteins hemagglutinin and neuraminidase and the 1s refer to the viral subtypes. Funny, eh? So obvious now that you know. Of course, hemagglutinin. Viral subtypes. Duh.</p>
<p>Anyway, I'm not here to take up a position, or to set provaccination and antivaccination factions against each other, like the Guelphs and the Ghibellines in the 12th century. I don't know what they'll do for or to my children, but if nothing else, these vaccinations -- with descriptives such as meningococcal, papilloma, and hemagglutinin and neuraminidase -- are bound to help their spelling.</p>
<p>Isn't it wonderful that science allows us to lift the veil on the ductwork of the diseases that plague us. I mean, there was a time when our understanding was very inexact. There was no differentiation or classification. Everything was simply the pox. "Scabs all over the body? Fever? Bleeding from the ears? Yep, the pox, probably brought on by a touch of demonic possession. Here's a little gall of henbane and bleed him thrice a day. Increase as needed. If he's dead by morning burn his corpse. Next."</p>
<p>Now we know, for instance, that the hepatitis B virus, against which my daughter was just immunized, "consists of an outer lipid envelope and an icosahedral nucleocapside core composed of protein."</p>
<p>Way to demystify, oh lamp of science.</p>
<p>Anyway, I need my shots too. I like them double. Ah, self- medication.</p>
<p>No pins for me. I already got that T-shirt. When I was being vaccinated, needles were the size of porcupine quills. The doctors were all men, with manners like prison guards.</p>
<p>You can tell by the vaccination marks on people's shoulders from my generation. They look like patches of bad road.</p>
<p>Ruby got through it OK. "It hardly hurt at all, dad," she told me. Now she calls it Hep B, short form, like it's an old friend.</p>
<p>"That's my girl," I said, giving her a little chuck on the shoulder. Oops, wrong one.</p>
<p>"Dad, you are so not helping."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Province to keep priority list - Not affected by study linking flu shots to H1N1</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>
<div>558 words</div><div>1 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>Manitoba is sticking to its plan on who will receive priority for seasonal flu shots this year despite new evidence questioning the potential link between such vaccinations and the risk of getting H1N1.</p>
<p>A preliminary analysis of data from hospitalized Canadian H1N1 cases suggests there is no connection between having a seasonal flu shot and developing a severe bout of pandemic flu, officials at the Public Health Agency of Canada said Wednesday.</p>
<p>They said the agency looked at data from hospitalized pandemic flu cases after learning of another, still unpublished study that seems to indicate people who got a flu shot last year had double the risk of catching H1N1 compared to unvaccinated people.</p>
<p>The jury is still out on whether or not that study -- based on data from three provinces -- has found a true effect or is flawed. But Dr. Frank Plummer, scientific director of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, on Wednesday called the lack of evidence of a link between seasonal flu shots and severe H1N1 "reassuring."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Manitoba health officials announced their top priorities for seasonal flu vaccine would be people over 65, those in personal-care homes and those of any age who are considered by their doctors to be at high risk of complications related to seasonal flu.</p>
<p>That hasn't changed, Dr. Joel Kettner, the chief provincial public health officer, said late Wednesday.</p>
<p>"If you're under 65 and you have no risk conditions, stand by. If you're under 65, and you have a risk condition that you have been told by your health provider is a reason that you are at high risk for complications of seasonal influenza you are encouraged to get your flu shot."</p>
<p>Complicating the province's seasonal flu vaccination season this year is the potential for a pandemic.</p>
<p>When the H1N1 flu vaccine arrives in November, or earlier, it will become the main priority for vaccinations in Manitoba, Kettner said.</p>
<p>It means the seasonal flu vaccination season this fall could be abbreviated. Therefore, healthy babies under 23 months will not be on the priority list this year, as in previous years.</p>
<p>The same goes for health-care workers who are in good health.</p>
<p>Kettner said the decision to shorten the priority list this year was made only in part because of the Canadian study linking past seasonal flu vaccinations to increased chances of obtaining H1N1.</p>
<p>The new evidence released Wednesday may make some people "feel more comfortable" about getting a seasonal flu shot if they're under 50, he said. But it has not caused the province to change its priorities.</p>
<p>The Winnipeg Regional Health Authority, which had scheduled large-scale seasonal flu vaccination clinics throughout the city Oct. 14 to 16, said Wednesday it would announce modifications to its plans today.</p>
<p>WRHA spokeswoman Heidi Graham said the revised plans come as a result of this week's new provincial flu vaccination guidelines.</p>
<p>Kettner said the province would only provide guidance to regional health authorities on who should have priority in receiving vaccinations.</p>
<p>It's up to the regional health authorities, he said, to decide how best to carry out their flu shot programs.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Schools to issue absentee updates - Province flip-flops on informing parents</b>
</div><div>By Larry Kusch    </div>
<div>438 words</div><div>1 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>GET ready for daily updates on absentee rates at your child's school as the province has now decided parents will be warned about potential outbreaks of H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>The pandemic policy flip-flop Wednesday afternoon came amid conflicting messages earlier in the day from Premier Gary Doer and long-term planning from school divisions based on a Manitoba Health directive that would have kept parents in the dark about H1N1 cases in the classroom.</p>
<p>"We are ensuring that parents have the information they need to make informed decisions regarding the health and safety of their children," Education Minister Peter Bjornson announced.</p>
<p>Families across the province will be able to get daily updates on unusual absentee rates at their children's schools by checking their school division website, Bjornson said.</p>
<p>Bjornson said the information will be similar to what is already provided to health authorities. If health officials see abnormally high absentee rates at a school, they investigate the cause.</p>
<p>He said informing parents of high student absentee rates gives them information much more quickly than waiting to tell them of confirmed cases of H1N1.</p>
<p>It will be up to school divisions to decide how to communicate information about high rates of absenteeism to parents, the minister said. In areas where families may not have access to the Internet, school notes may be sent home.</p>
<p>"The directive (to school divisions) is to communicate as effectively as possible for the parents," Bjornson said.</p>
<p>The Conservative Opposition had been hounding the government for weeks to come up with a policy for warning parents of school-age children about an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>But the government had been content to leave the decision to medical experts.</p>
<p>"I think we should rely on medical advice on what we should do in a school and how we should inform people," Doer told the Free Press Wednesday morning, adding that knowing when to inform parents was a complicated decision and varied depending on the size of the school. He made similar comments to CJOB in the morning.</p>
<p>But a few hours later, the province rolled out a new communication strategy.</p>
<p>Conservative Leader Hugh McFadyen accused the government of making policy on the fly. He said the announcement and the premier's earlier comments showed a lack of overall government preparation on H1N1.</p>
<p>"This flying by the seat of their pants and making up policy as they go along does nothing to reassure Manitobans that they're on top of this important file," McFadyen said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Bocce: the sport where 'wining' is required -</b>
</div><div>In the Doug House / Doug Speirs    </div>
<div>886 words</div><div>1 October 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.    </div>
</p>
<p>You can wring your hands all you want about H1N1, because I personally have come down with something far more serious -- I am burning with Bocce Fever.</p>
<p>I caught it Tuesday night when, in an upset so stunning that everyone who witnessed it was totally stunned -- my bocce team won its first-ever playoff game.</p>
<p>Is that exciting sports-related news, or what? I know what you are thinking. You are thinking: "Huh???" Well, I don't blame you. Unless you happen to be a middle-aged Italian man who enjoys hanging around in bars, you probably have never heard of bocce before.</p>
<p>Here's a little history: Bocce is a sport that was invented by the ancient Egyptians, who used to play with polished rocks. It was taken over by the Italians, who wisely opted for wheels of cheese instead of rocks. You can look this stuff up.</p>
<p>Eventually, someone came up with the genius idea of using grapefruit-sized balls made of rubber and resin and -- voila! -- the modern game, roughly pronounced "BOW-chay," was born.</p>
<p>The way it works is two teams of four players roll balls called "boccia" down a narrow grass court known as the "campo." The object is to get your balls closer than your opponents' balls to another little white ball called the "pallino." You play three games to 11 points, then everyone heads back into the bar for more wine.</p>
<p>And that's the main point about bocce. I am pretty sure it is illegal to play the game unless you are within stumbling distance of a bar. The game itself is very much like curling, except there is a lot more drinking involved.</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, it is extremely difficult to tell active bocce players apart from people who are (a) just standing around casually drinking wine; or (b) lying motionless on the ground for no apparent reason.</p>
<p>As it turns out, I am pretty good at this game, which combines the thrills and spills of lawn darts with the high drama of watching televised poker.</p>
<p>I'm not saying you don't have to be in great shape to play bocce... no, wait, that's exactly what I'm saying. It really doesn't matter what shape you are in. If you currently have a pulse, you have an excellent shot at being one of the best bocce players in the country.</p>
<p>The most strenuous part of the sport is crouching down in the accepted bowling stance, then flinging your balls wildly down the court. Even the North American Aerospace Defence Command has a hard time tracking balls thrown by members of my team.</p>
<p>We tend to throw with the accuracy of North Korean missiles, by which I mean at any given time it is entirely possible one of our balls will slam into the Sea of Japan.</p>
<p>We are not, technically, a good team in the sense that we rarely win a game.</p>
<p>There are roughly 24 teams in our league, all of them with incredibly stupid names.</p>
<p>For example, the team we beat in the first round of the playoffs -- every team gets into the playoffs; it's very democratic -- was named after an Italian salad.</p>
<p>My team is officially named "Freep," because the players are somehow connected with this newspaper. But we like to think of ourselves as the "No-show Joes," because our star player is Joe Grande, the owner of Mona Lisa Ristorante, which is where we play all of our games.</p>
<p>When he is there, Joe is the Wayne Gretzky of bocce ball. The problem is that Joe has a God-given ability to forget to show up on the nights we play.</p>
<p>He is also colour blind, so we have to point at the balls we want him to hit, but he is so talented he could easily toss a bocce ball from behind his bar and, wherever you're sitting at the moment, hit you with it.</p>
<p>But the best thing about bocce is that it is a fun, recreational activity in which people of all genders and ages can get together and, over a glass of wine, enjoy a friendly rivalry.</p>
<p>And if you believe that, you are what is known in bocce circles as "an idiot."</p>
<p>We are all deadly serious about winning. For example, when the referee (always an older Italian-Canadian gentleman) pulls out his tape measure to determine whether the green ball or the red ball is closer to the white ball, both teams hover over him, staring down with the kind of intensity they display when examining dead bodies on an episode of CSI.</p>
<p>My wife insists that when I am in the process of rolling the ball, I screw my facial features up into a pained expression she calls my "bocce face."</p>
<p>Me: "You mean I look like a fierce competitor?"</p>
<p>My wife: "No, you look like you haven't gone to the bathroom in six years!"</p>
<p>The point is, bocce fever is definitely contagious. You may not be a natural like me, but I still think you should give it a try.</p>
<p>I'll even hold your wine for you.</p>

</p>
<p>IT is a dicey thing to have politics interfering in public health policy, but it is also a reality and occasionally it is for the better. Education Minister Peter Bjornson's edict Wednesday to school boards to report high absenteeism publicly, school by school, recognizes the rightful role of parents in protecting children as H1N1 flu re-emerges this fall.</p>
<p>School boards and government health officials had been opposed to issuing notice to parents when a school saw its student population fall -- schools were routinely asked to report absenteeism of 10 per cent to public health officials, but the threshold for notice became a sliding measure with the onset of H1N1. Some schools typically have high absenteeism. Public health officials now ask for reports of "unusually high absenteeism."</p>
<p>School officials decided it was information that would not be shared publicly. The boards insisted this was because H1N1 was already present in the schools, making notice to parents futile. Rather, parents would be notified only if an extraordinary circumstance triggered the closure of a school.</p>
<p>That attitude diminishes the right of parents to have good information to make informed decisions regarding their children's risk of H1N1 -- a parent might play the odds if attendance drops by 10 per cent, but react swiftly if it rises to 30 per cent. The position carries the regrettable whiff of "the officials know best" that contributes to uncertainty and suspicion among citizens in a pandemic situation, when trust in public offices is critical.</p>
<p>Public reaction was swift and harsh. Premier Gary Doer's admission on CJOB radio Wednesday morning that he'd want to know if there were numerous cases of confirmed H1N1 in his daughter's school made it untenable. Mr. Bjornson, recognizing a political storm, pulled rank. A government news release said that unusually high absenteeism rates will be posted daily on-line for schools, on school division websites. The notice will not be specific to H1N1 illness, which reflects the reasonable position that public institutions should always default to transparency, rendering moot the concern that special notice will unnecessarily alarm people. Further, public day care centres would be asked to set up the means to give parents similar notice.</p>
<p>Principals should be mindful that not all parents have access to computers. Notices might need to go home in children's backpacks.</p>
<p>To date, H1N1 has not had real virulence; its impact on the vast majority of those who catch it has been mild. Early evidence from Southeast United States and British Columbia, where it is re-emerging, indicates that its effect remains mild. Manitoba's experience last spring, however, was that aboriginal people were at elevated risk. That is a special concern for some Manitoba schools. Meanwhile, public health officials reassure Manitobans that there is no reason now to close any school, a last resort since to do so may send kids into other social settings, such as shopping malls, where influenza can spread unabated.</p>
<p>The best public health planning uses science, experience and the medical evidence available to prepare, protect and care for people. The foundation of those plans rests upon the public's trust in decisions being made. Mr. Bjornson's edict recognizes that trust evaporates if people are denied the basic information they need to assess the plan as it rolls out, especially as it relates to their personal interests.</p>

<p>WINNIPEG -- Sometimes medical researchers must raid the past for cures of the future.</p>
<p>For Winnipeg intensive-care specialist Anand Kumar, a single article about the 1918 influenza epidemic sparked the idea for an ingeniously simple H1N1 treatment that could be saving lives within six weeks.</p>
<p>“This form of therapy helped back then and I think it can do the same for us now,” said Dr. Kumar, who treated dozens of Manitoba's most severe H1N1 cases last spring.</p>
<p>During the 1918 flu epidemic that killed upwards of 50 million people, doctors devised a method of extracting plasma from flu survivors and transfusing it into people stricken with the virus. The process of borrowing antibodies reduced death rates significantly and has been adapted to treat hepatitis A, herpes infections and other viruses.</p>
<p>But until now, it hasn't been used to treat another flu outbreak.</p>
<p>“That's because you don't see people horribly ill from seasonal flu very often,” Dr. Kumar said. “This year, though, the risk is so high and we anticipate so many people will be ill, that it makes sense to develop this as an emergency therapy.”</p>
<p>Many intensive-care doctors have felt helpless in treating severe H1N1 cases. Once they exhaust the therapies at their disposal – the antiviral Tamiflu and supportive care such as fluids and oxygen – they can do little but watch. So far, 78 Canadians have died of the virus.</p>
<p>“Things like Tamiflu definitely help, but some people will get severely ill despite that,” said Dr. Kumar, who monitored 40 ventilated patients at the height of the spring onslaught. “This gives us another bullet in the gun for this battle.”</p>
<p>Dr. Kumar is working with Winnipeg-based biopharmaceutical company Cangene to produce the treatment, called hyperimmune globulin. Yesterday, Cangene started posting ads asking for H1N1 survivors to donate plasma.</p>
<p>“We did this with SARS, collecting plasma from recovered health-care workers, so we're experienced,” said company president John Langstaff.</p>
<p>The production process faces a number of regulatory and funding hurdles before the globulin can be distributed to hospitals, but Dr. Kumar doesn't anticipate any great delays. “The hope is, if everything goes well, it will be available by Christmas,” he said. “I'd like to see it available on a compassionate basis within six weeks. Whether we'll get there or not, I don't know.”</p>
<p>Health Canada will begin rolling out an H1N1 vaccine by late October or early November. The globulin differs from a vaccine in that it will be used to treat severe cases of the virus, rather than prevent contraction. “Basically, you take antibodies from someone who's recovered from H1N1, you concentrate it, and then you give it to someone who's deathly ill fighting for their lives,” Dr. Kumar said. “The theory is this will help because it loans patients the immune system of someone who's already fought the virus off.”</p>
<p>Researchers in Europe and the United States are also exploring globulin treatments, but the Winnipeg team appears to have a jump on the world.</p>
<p>“We could be extremely lucky and not need this,” Dr. Kumar said, “and I'd love to be lucky, but I'd rather be prepared.”</p>

<p>A good question</p>
<p>“A would-be convenience store robber,” Japantoday.com reports, “called police and turned himself in after being reprimanded by an employee in Fukushima on Tuesday morning. According to police, Takashi Owata entered a Sunkus convenience store and demanded cash from a 59-year-old female employee. The woman told police she glared at the man and yelled, ‘What the hell do you think you're doing?' According to police, Owata threatened the woman with a wooden stick, but left the store without any money after she yelled at him. He then called police from his mobile phone and confessed to trying to rob the store.”</p>
<p>First out the airlock?</p>
<p>“The man who hopes to be the first clown in space, Cirque du Soleil founder Guy Laliberté, said Tuesday he would tickle fellow astronauts as they sleep aboard the International Space Station,” Associated Press reports. The clown told reporters he had been tickling his fellow astronauts during training.</p>
<p>The only problems</p>
<p>“Years ago,” David Allen writes in Wired magazine, “a friend added to my understanding of the fundamental duality of our universe by sharing this observation: ‘There are only two problems in life: You know what you want and you don't know how to get it; or you don't know what you want.' ”</p>
<p>Fighting germs</p>
<p>As concern over swine flu grows, germophobes are on high alert, Laura Landro writes in The Wall Street Journal. “Sales of alcohol-based hand sanitizers were up nearly 17 per cent as of the first week of September compared to the same period last year, according to Chicago-based research firm Information Resources. And marketers are taking full advantage of our paranoia, introducing anti-bacterial dishwasher-safe keyboards, machine-washable leather shoes, germ-resistant paper file folders and even hands-free communion wafer dispensers for churches.”</p>
<p>Do bombers walk funny?</p>
<p>“Al-Qaeda has made a horrifying – if bizarre – advance in terrorist tradecraft,” Christopher Dickey reports for Newsweek.com. “As recently reported by my friend Frank Gardner, security correspondent for the BBC, the suicide bomber who tried unsuccessfully to blow up Saudi Arabia's counterterrorism chief in August actually had the explosives inside his body. It's possible the bomb – which was made from materials that wouldn't set off metal detectors – was swallowed or stitched into him in some fashion, but according to one usually authoritative Saudi official, the explosives had been inserted in the terrorist's rectum.”</p>
<p>A busy cleaner</p>
<p>“A pregnant woman has filed paternity claims against six separate inmates of a Romanian prison,” Ananova.com reports. “Mum-to-be Raluca Dionescu from Iasi says any one of the convicts she met while working part-time at the jail could be the father. The prisoners – aged between 24 and 35 – will have to submit to blood and DNA tests. Dionescu, who was employed as a cleaner at the prison near Iasi, admitted she had enjoyed steamy sessions with the inmates in the prison's laundry room. She said: ‘I couldn't resist some of the men. … What I want now though is to find out which one is the father of my child.' ”</p>
<p>Hyena teamwork</p>
<p>U.S. evolutionary anthropologists say they've discovered that spotted hyenas outperform primates on co-operative problem-solving tests, <span class="companylink">United Press International</span> reports. Duke University scientists led by associate professor Christine Drea said captive pairs of spotted hyenas that needed to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward co-operated successfully and learned the manoeuvres quickly with no training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced partners do the trick. When confronted with a similar task, chimpanzees and other primates often required extensive training, Prof. Drea said. Her study, co-authored with Allisa Carter of the University of California, Berkeley, is published in Animal Behaviour.</p>
<p>Stressed koalas</p>
<p>“The koala, Australia's star symbol, is dying of stress,” Associated Press reports. “Koalas live in the rolling hills and flat plains where eucalyptus trees grow, because they need the leaves for both food and water. But as people move in, koalas are finding themselves with fewer trees, researchers say. The stress is bringing out a latent disease that infects 50 to 90 per cent of the animals. ‘Koalas are in diabolical trouble,' says researcher Frank Carrick, who heads the Koala Study Program at the University of Queensland. ‘Numbers show that even in their stronghold, koala numbers are declining alarmingly.' … Chlamydiosis is a virus that breaks out in koalas in times of stress – like cold sores in humans – and leads to infections in the eyes and urinary, reproductive and respiratory tracts. It can cause blindness, infertility and death.”</p>

<p>The looming threat of the spread of the H1N1 flu virus will usher in a new era of etiquette among Canadian athletes at next year's Olympics in Vancouver.</p>
<p>Handshakes? Out. High-fives? No way. The cheek-to-cheek kiss? Forget it.</p>
<p>“You're supposed to pound fists with people now,” said Bryce Davison, who with Jessica Dubé is one of Canada's medal hopefuls in pairs figure skating.</p>
<p>After a pause and a laugh, he adds: “It will be interesting.”</p>
<p>Canadian athletes are being told to avoid traditional hand-to-hand contact to protect themselves from the H1N1 virus. In lieu, they're being told to fist-bump.</p>
<p>The order comes from Canadian Olympic Committee chief medical officer Bob McCormack, who also urges athletes to carry hand sanitizer in their battle against the flu.</p>
<p>Discussions about alternatives to the handshake began back in the spring. Some suggestions were a stretch, such as an elbow-to-elbow greeting that would form a V – for Vancouver – between two people's arms.</p>
<p>“I can reassure everyone we're not going to have any kissing police that will go around and say ‘let's have some separation here,' ” Dr. McCormack said.</p>
<p>“What we're saying is think about it.”</p>
<p>Dr. McCormack likes to say that “the Olympics are where the viruses of the world come to meet,” and the risk is compounded for the Vancouver Olympics Organizing Committee by the worldwide H1N1 flu outbreak. It's a serious issue in the host city.</p>
<p>“We're more actively promoting and raising awareness of the importance of vaccinations, regular handwashing, coughing into your sleeve and staying home if you're sick as successful prevention strategies,” said Jack Taunton, chief medical officer for VANOC.</p>
<p>But for Mr. Davison, the fist-bump could be a bit awkward. He's been skating since he was six years old, and has difficulty envisioning himself fist-bumping senior officials, such as International Skating Union president Ottavio Cinquanta.</p>
<p>“How you can do a proper and firm fist-bump is beyond me,” the 23-year-old Mr. Davison said.</p>
<p>“With people that are over 30 or 40, it's going to be a little weird … If [Mr. Cinquanta] comes up to me and sticks out his fist, I guess I'll punch it.”</p>

<p>Juliet Guichon and Ian Mitchell (The Courts Need Surge Capacity – Sept. 30) express concern that litigation may hinder the implementation of pandemic protocols for the H1N1 flu and call for increased court capacity to respond to such litigation. The historical record in Canada suggests their concern is misplaced.</p>
<p>During the 2003 SARS crisis, which is as close to the H1N1 pandemic as Canada has experienced in recent years, there was not a single court challenge to the decision-making of public health officials. Litigation as an avenue for challenging pandemic protocols requires an institutional support mechanism as well as a particular legal consciousness among those affected by these protocols. Neither of these are well established in Canada.</p>
<p>Some Canadians may well challenge the protocols for H1N1, but they're unlikely to choose the courts as the venues for those challenges. If litigation involving H1N1 and public health policy does occur, it is likely to involve persons who bought vaccines privately and unsuccessfully sought repayment from their provincial health-insurance plan.</p>
<p>Should these litigations arise, they won't involve court injunctions suspending the implementation of pandemic protocols and, hence, won't raise the issues of urgency pressed by Prof. Guichon and Prof. Mitchell.</p>

<p>Even in tough times, Jackie Maxwell does not believe in playing it safe. So, in assembling the Shaw Festival's 2010 lineup, its artistic director decided comedy, for sure, but comedy with a bite.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, as the recession put a damper on ticket sales, Maxwell said the easy route would have been to go for the tried-and-true old faithfuls.</p>
<p>"People go, 'You have to retrench your programming, you have to make it safe and easy and people will come.' The notion of ... hiding and sitting back, I think that really is not the way to do it and I don't think that our audiences are particularly up for that," Maxwell said.</p>
<p>"If ever there was a time for trying to clarify and contextualize all these crazy things that are happening, it's now." The theme of the Shaw's 10-production program in 2010 will be "provocative and stimulating," Maxwell said.</p>
<p>That begins with two works from the festival's namesake, George Bernard Shaw, which Maxwell described as "two of his sparkiest and deeply pertinent plays."</p>
<p>A Doctor's Dilemma, directed by Morris Panych, examines with a dark comic eye the ethical issue of who gets the cure when there isn't enough for everybody. (Think the H1N1 vaccine.)</p>
<p>Maxwell persuaded revered former artistic director Christopher Newton, who ran the festival for 23 years, to take on the second Shaw piece, John Bull's Other Island, a comic look at colonialism.</p>
<p>Other works include:</p>
<p>Oscar Wilde's An Ideal Husband, about a politician hiding a dark past and his devoted but conflicted wife. (Modern examples abound.)</p>
<p>Caryl Churchill's Serious Money, set in the late 1980s climate of high finance and greed. ("Incredibly timely," Maxwell noted.)</p>
<p>Canadian playwright Linda Griffiths' The Age of Arousal, a fin-de-siecle period piece about a suffragette running a typing agency.</p>
<p>Clare Booth Luce's The Women, about life in the powder rooms and salons of the fairer sex.</p>
<p>The Cherry Orchard, Anton Chekhov's gentle but pointed comedy of manners.</p>
<p>Harvey by Mary Chase (the theme of it - who's really crazy - could not be more contemporary).</p>
<p>One Touch of Venus, a musical comedy from the 1940s, with tunes by Kurt Weill and story by Ogden Nash and S.J. Perelman, one of the creative minds behind the Marx Brothers films.</p>
<p>A Half Hour, a one-act play by J.M. Barrie, the author of Peter Pan.</p>

</div><div>BRENT JANG </div>

</p>
<p>TRANSPORTATION REPORTER</p>
<p>Sunwing Travel Group is solidifying its position as Canada's second-largest tour operator by merging with <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span>, putting pressure on leader <span class="companylink">Transat A.T. Inc</span>. as the industry struggles with an excess of holiday packages.</p>
<p>Analysts have been concerned about the ability of Transat and Sunwing to maintain profit margins amid intense competition, pointing to the “economic slack” in the industry – tens of thousands of unsold holiday packages during the economic downturn, despite sharply discounted prices.</p>
<p>But Stephen Hunter, Sunwing's chief operating officer, said he's starting to see rosier advance bookings – signs of an uptick in consumer confidence as tour operators prepare for the fall and winter travel season to sun destinations.</p>
<p>“Every week that goes by, we're seeing year-over-year improvements, and of course, cold Canadian weather wouldn't hurt, either,” Mr. Hunter said in an interview yesterday after announcing Sunwing's merger with the Canadian operations of <span class="companylink">TUI Travel PLC</span>.</p>
<p>British-based <span class="companylink">TUI</span>, through its money-losing First Choice Canada division, owns tour operator Signature and the SellOffVacations retail arm.</p>
<p>“The consumer will benefit with better pricing and improved product lines in the next six to 12 months,” he said. “People don't want to stay at a dump. They want a nice hotel, but they don't want to pay a lot. There will be deals.”</p>
<p>Sunwing, privately owned by the Hunter family of Toronto, is effectively selling a 49-per-cent equity stake in the combined entity to <span class="companylink">TUI</span>, but will relinquish only a 25-per-cent voting interest.</p>
<p>Under the transaction set to close by mid-November, <span class="companylink">TUI</span> is offering Signature, SellOffVacations and $101-million in return for the equity stake. Mr. Hunter, 38, will become president and chief executive officer of Sunwing, replacing his father, Colin, who remains as chairman. The Sunwing, Signature and SellOffVacations brand names will be retained.</p>
<p>Toronto-based Sunwing runs a packaged holiday unit and also operates a fleet of 14 leased <span class="companylink">Boeing</span> 737-800 jets through its airline division. Sunwing is pledging to honour its contract to charter <span class="companylink">Skyservice Airlines Inc</span>. to fly on behalf of Signature, but could switch to Sunwing's fleet within two years. Skyservice also flies on behalf of <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span>, the country's third-largest tour operator.</p>
<p>Federal rules limit foreign ownership of Canadian airlines to a 25-per-cent voting interest, although Ottawa plans to raise the cap to 49 per cent.</p>
<p>Montreal-based Transat posted a $43.7-million profit for the nine months ended July 31, but it is warning about the “abundant supply” of holiday packages on the market. Sunwing said its annual revenue surpasses $660-million and its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the current fiscal year should exceed the $42-million posted for the year ended Oct. 31, 2008. By contrast, <span class="companylink">TUI</span>'s Canadian operations are forecast to lose $38-million for its current fiscal year.</p>
<p>The combined Sunwing entity will have revenue of $900-million a year.</p>
<p>“The Canadian tour operator market has been plagued in recent years by too much capacity and too many players,” Versant Partners Inc. analyst Cameron Doerksen said in a research note yesterday. “As a result, margins for all operators, Transat included, have been squeezed.”</p>
<p>In April, Conquest Vacations Inc. shut down after 37 years in business, blaming slow sales and cutthroat pricing in the industry.</p>
<p>Signature has strength in Mexico, complementing Sunwing's clout in Cuba, Mr. Doerksen said. The Sunwing-Signature team plans to crank up its promotion of Mexico, whose tourism industry got crushed last April after the outbreak of H1N1 influenza.</p>
<p>Other leading players in the sector include Air Canada Vacations and WestJet Vacations. Gregg Saretsky, formerly at <span class="companylink">Alaska Airlines Inc</span>., was named vice-president for WestJet Vacations in June, signalling parent <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>.'s plans to expand its tour division.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Transat A.T</span>. (TRZ.B)</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Tourism spending continues its decline</b>
</div><div>Canwest News Service</div>

</p>
<p>Restricted travel from Canada to Mexico over swine flu fears and stiffer border policies between Canada and the U.S. caused tourism spending to drop for the fourth straight quarter, Statistics Canada said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Tourism spending fell 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2009‚ the federal agency said, bringing the total decline to 2.9 per cent over the last four quarters.</p>
<p>The second quarter, however, wasn't as harsh as the previous reporting period, which saw figures drop 1.3 per cent in the year's first quarter.</p>
<p>The initial outbreak of H1N1 earlier this year resulted in Canadian airlines putting a hold on travel to Mexico -- where the virus was first reported -- which reduced the number of people who travelled to the popular vacation destination.</p>
<p>Also, new document requirements to travel between Canada and the U.S. taking effect on June 1 also had an impact on the second-quarter figures, Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>Virus outbreaks usually hit tourism figures hard, with the 2003 SARS outbreak resulted in a massive decline.</p>
<p>Tourism spending fell 5.8 per cent in the first half of 2003, when Canada -- with its largest city, Toronto, at the centre of the crisis -- was in the grips of the respiratory illness.</p>
<p>The four-quarter marks the longest Canadian downturn in tourism numbers since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Contributions to the economy from international visitors to Canada continued its trend of decline in the second quarter when it dropped 1.6 per cent, resulting in the sixth straight quarterly decline and the 15th drop in 18 quarters.</p>
<p>The impact on tourism spending also filtered down to the employment level, which fell 0.9 per cent in the second quarter. Most tourism job losses were found in the air transportation, travel services and accommodation industries.</p>

<p>As Catholics drain the holy water from their church fonts and soccer kids refrain from after-game handshakes in an effort to stop the spread of the H1N1 flu strain, Alberta is set to announce how it will roll out its vaccine during the flu pandemic this fall.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the province is expected to announce the timing of its seasonal flu vaccination campaign in light of a yet-unpublished Canadian study that suggested getting a seasonal flu shot can double your risk of getting H1N1.</p>
<p>Since the results of that study were released, Quebec has delayed its annual flu campaign until January so it can focus on preventing H1N1.</p>
<p>In Ontario, only seniors and those living in long-term care facilities will be offered seasonal flu shots in October, since seniors are at lower risk of contracting the H1N1 strain. Others will have to wait until after the H1N1 vaccinations are complete.</p>
<p>"We are weighing the pros and cons of following other provinces," Dr. Andre Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, said last week. "I'm not going to make a decision based on that study....We need to gather more information before I can make a decision."</p>
<p>Studies in other countries on the H1N1 vaccine haven't had similar results.</p>
<p>Alberta typically rolls out is annual flu shots in October, but the shots aimed at the H1N1 strain won't be available until November. Both campaigns are expected to be massive, since this is the first year every Albertan--not just those in higher-risk groups, such as pregnant moms and infants--will be able to get both vaccines for free.</p>
<p>In the meantime, schools, churches and work places are going beyond the typical instructions to "wash your hands" or "sneeze into your sleeve" by introducing new policies to try slow down the spread of the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Edmonton Catholics are going to have to bless themselves at church without holy water. Parishioners traditionally dip their fingers into bowls of holy water at the entrance to the sanctuary, then make the sign of the cross to remind themselves of their baptism.</p>
<p>"You have hundreds of hands dipping into that water, and so it is a potential source of the spread of infection," said Lorraine Turchansky, spokeswoman for the Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton, which is having ongoing discussions with local health officials on how best to keep people healthy. The archdiocese is also reinstituting other restrictions it put in place during the spring outbreak of H1N1, but lifted over the summer.</p>
<p>People are being asked to not shake hands, but bow or nod in greeting. Priests are getting rid of the shared communion cup and are putting communion wafers into the hands of worshippers rather than onto their tongues.</p>
<p>That move was distressing to some people, Turchansky said, especially those who had always received the wafer directly into their mouths.</p>
<p>"Their feeling about it is pretty deep and their feeling is this is the Body of Christ and a person must be properly reverential in receiving it," Turchansky said. "On the whole, the response is positive because people realize the reasoning behind it. We're ultimately taking care of each other and if we can prevent illness, then that is something we should all do. ...Some of these things means a bit of a sacrifice for people, but we're confident that they will understand and appreciate that that sacrifice is being taken for the greater good of all of us."</p>
<p>The Edmonton Minor Soccer Association has also stopped handshakes between players at the end of games during the indoor season, which runs from October to March.</p>
<p>"Both teams will stand in front of each other and cheer/clap for the other team(and) immediately after they will advance to their respective dressing rooms," reads the new policy. It also strongly suggests players don't share water bottles or mouth guards.</p>
<p>"If we can prevent one child from getting sick or spreading the virus, I say we're doing the right thing," said Mario Charpentier, president of the minor soccer association, noting that some players sneeze or spit into their hands during the game. He acknowledged kids will still shake hands and congregate in movie theatres. Crowded, sweaty dressing rooms can also be places where germs can spread.</p>
<p>"How much are we going to prevent? I don't know," Charpentier said. "Are we overdoing it?Maybe. But better safe than sorry. We've got to help the kids."</p>
<p>Teachers at Elk Island Public Schools were encouraged at the start of the school year to set up their classrooms using a strategy known as social distancing.</p>
<p>The idea, said the district's occupational health and safety specialist Lisa Johnston, is to space children farther apart to help limit the spread of germs.</p>
<p>"Sometimes they have options for how they set up their classrooms," Johnston said. "In the kindergarten and elementary levels, sometimes they like to set up in groups. We've discouraged that. We've encouraged them to have the desks at least arm's-length apart."</p>
<p>Johnston is not yet aware of any teachers who have changed students' desk arrangements because of H1N1 concerns.</p>
<p>She is getting plenty of calls from teachers asking about how to clean such things as classroom toys or musical instruments.</p>
<p>"Every day, we get new questions that we hadn't really thought of before," Johnston said.</p>

</p>
<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Consumers should expect more choice and possibly even lower prices in the vacation industry as two of Canada's major tour operators merge.</p>
<p>Sunwing Vacations announced Tuesday that it will merge with struggling tour operator <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span> and its SellOffVacations retail division under a strategic alliance with U.K.-based <span class="companylink">TUI Travel PLC</span>.</p>
<p>Precise finance details of the deal were not disclosed.</p>
<p>The move will create a larger company that is better protected from the vagaries of an industry that has taken successive beatings from high fuel prices, the economic downturn and concerns about the H1N1 flu virus.</p>
<p>Sunwing chief operating officer Stephen Hunter said the merger will solidify the company's position as the No. 2 tour operator in Canada and will provide travellers with more choice.</p>
<p>"It's a good combination between Sunwing Vacations and Signature, because Signature is quite heavily focused on Mexico in particular and the Dominican Republic, whereas Sunwing was focused more so on Cuba as well as some other Caribbean destinations," Hunter said in an interview.</p>
<p>"So for our customers they'll have more choice and more frequency of flights as well to all of the destinations."</p>
<p>The head of a travel industry association said the merger will strengthen Sunwing's position in the tour operator market, a move that will likely improve competition in the industry and lower prices as a result.</p>
<p>"I think it makes them a strong player in this market, so that means we continue to have good competition, which will help consumers get the best opportunities and the best pricing that they possibly can," said David McCaig, president of the Association of Canadian Travel Agencies.</p>
<p>The two merging businesses have fared differently during the recession. Over the last five years, the Toronto-based Hunter family's Sunwing Travel Group has seen revenues increase more than 20-fold to $660 million from $30 million and has maintained underlying profitability.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, First Choice Canada, of which <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span> is a division, lost $20 million in the first half of the current financial year.</p>
<p>Airline analyst Jacques Kavafian of Research Capital described the merger as an "amazing move" for Sunwing. "The problem with <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span> is it's always been badly managed," Kavafian said.</p>
<p>"It's probably the weakest link in the business in Canada, and now Sunwing can do phenomenally well with Signature because they're getting ($240 million) of revenue and they can almost instantly turn that into a profitable business."</p>
<p>Hunter said Sunwing plans to keep the Signature brand, despite its problems.</p>
<p>"I think the Signature brand has a lot of value," he said. "It's a brand that's been around a long time, and I think with some of the things that we've got planned for it, we'll be able to make it a strong brand again."</p>
<p>He added that the acquisition of the SellOffVacations brand of travel agencies will allow Sunwing direct access to the retail market, which will help the company diversify its revenues and solidify its distribution system.</p>
<p>Sunwing said it's too early to tell if there will be layoffs as the two companies consolidate. .</p>
<p>"The good thing about it is Sunwing is still growing, so it's not like we're taking two businesses and saying, ‘OK, we only have 1,000 passengers and we're only ever going to have 1,000 passengers,' " Hunter said. "Sunwing is growing anyway, so as we continue to grow we'll need more and more good people and there are a lot of good and talented people at First Choice Canada."</p>
<p>The Hunter family will retain control of the new company in partnership with Signature owner <span class="companylink">TUI Travel PLC</span>, which operates in approximately 180 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>As part of the deal announced Tuesday, <span class="companylink">TUI Travel</span> will contribute $101 million and its Canadian operations including <span class="companylink">Signature Vacations</span> to the new venture. In return, <span class="companylink">TUI Travel</span> will get a 25 per cent voting interest and 49 per cent ownership in the Sunwing Travel Group.</p>

</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>The Guelph General Hospital has been working feverishly to ensure that if pandemic H1N1 flu strikes, it's ready for the worst.</p>
<p>Hospital-wide preparations are underway with each department.</p>
<p>"It's going to affect the whole hospital (if it strikes), so we want to make every area prepared," hospital infection prevention and control co-ordinator Wendy James said Tuesday.</p>
<p>"This will be our second wave," James said, noting the first wave of infections around the globe was in the spring, with the World Health Organization declaring a pandemic situation in the summer. That hasn't been rescinded.</p>
<p>James noted some areas of the southern hemisphere were hit recently with a second wave of contagious H1N1 infections, which may ultimately reach Canada.</p>
<p>"We're just starting the beginning of our flu season. It's a lot of watching and waiting and being prepared," James said.</p>
<p>The provincial Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care several years ago began recommending health care pandemic planning several years ago, though not specifically for H1N1 but any dangerous contagious organism that could foster a widespread international infection among nations and regions of the world, James noted.</p>
<p>She said the hospital's various health care groups have been meeting in recent months in particular to plan responses to pandemic H1N1, the current threat. These also include the public health board and various health care groups in the community. Part of this entails sharing information through teleconferences and webcasts.</p>
<p>"There's been a lot of information sharing," James said. "We're working hard at being proactive."</p>
<p>The hospital has also been stockpiling at least a four-week supply of items needed in responding to a pandemic threat this fall. That includes adequate supplies of medications, masks, gowns, gloves and respiratory equipment.</p>
<p>Vaccines are to be made available shortly, the health ministry reported.</p>
<p>James said there were early discussions on whether hospital staff should be offered proactive Tamiflu treatments as a preventive measure. It was decided that wouldn't be prudent, in part because of the risk the H1N1 flu might become immune to the treatment from overuse.</p>
<p>"We don't want it to develop a resistance." That means judicious use of Tamiflu, James added.</p>
<p>Preparations also include surge planning, which means responding to a wave of infections, should they strike and place extra stress on hospital resources. That includes a typically busy emergency ward.</p>
<p>James expects further planning with the public health board to complete this. "We've been working very closely with public health."</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph is working on its own response, a big part of which involves offering vaccinations in the weeks and months ahead against both H1N1 and seasonal flu.</p>
<p>These are to be tailored so those at greatest risk receive the appropriate vaccinations first.</p>

<p>OTTAWA -- Tourism spending in Canada fell 0.8 per cent in the second quarter, its fourth straight decline.</p>
<p>Statistics Canada said two factors are to blame for the slip - the cancellation of Canadian flights to Mexico after the H1N1 influenza outbreak there and the June 1 start of more stringent document rules at the border with the United States.</p>
<p>The agency reported Tuesday that spending by international visitors to Canada fell 1.6 per cent in the second quarter, the sixth quarterly drop in a row and the 15th decline in 18 quarters.</p>
<p>Canadians' spending on tourism within Canada fell 0.6 per cent in real terms in the second quarter after three earlier more modest declines.</p>
<p>Gross domestic product from tourism contracted 1.1 per cent in the second quarter, its fourth straight quarterly drop.</p>
<p>Employment in the sector fell 0.9 per cent.</p>

<p>A Toronto educator working at a Canadian school in Hong Kong has died after contracting the H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Alan Dick, lower school principal at the Canadian International School of Hong Kong, fell ill on Sept. 20, the school said in a letter. He took the week off, but attended a meeting with school director Dave McMaster on Thursday.</p>
<p>Three days later, Mr. Dick, 55, was admitted to hospital, and “his condition deteriorated rapidly and he passed away in the afternoon of the same day,” Hong Kong's Centre for Health Protection said.</p>
<p>Mr. Dick did have the flu virus, but it's not clear whether it was the cause of his death.</p>
<p>“The CHP [Centre for Health Protection] visited the school [Monday]. They were satisfied there is currently no risk of an H1N1 outbreak,” read another school letter, released a day later.</p>
<p>The school is an International Baccalaureate program for preschool children up to Grade 12, and offers courses in English and Mandarin. It has about 1,700 students from 30 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>Mr. Dick joined the school in 1994, and is described in a school online memorial as “a passionate and dynamic educator, and a proud Canadian.” Mr. Dick is survived by his mother and two siblings.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No plan for H1N1 school alerts What Manitoba Health is saying about identifying schools affected by H1N1 - Parents won't be told of cases, absenteeism</b>
</div><div>By Nick Martin   </div>
<div>982 words</div><div>30 September 2009</div><div>Winnipeg Free Press</div><div>WFP</div><div>A3</div><div>English</div><div>All material copyright Winnipeg Free Press, a division of FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership. All rights reserved.   </div>
</p>
<p>There'll be hand sanitizers in classrooms, but parents won't know if there's a confirmed case of H1N1 in their child's school or an unusual absentee rate.</p>
<p>And a number of school divisions and health officials say there'll be no public identification of a school with a confirmed case of H1N1 or absenteeism of 10 per cent or more above seasonal norms.</p>
<p>"Notifying the parents, we're not doing that," said Pembina Trails superintendent Lawrence Lussier.</p>
<p>Superintendents across Winnipeg met with the Winnipeg Regional Health Authority last Wednesday, but school divisions have been preparing pandemic plans for months.</p>
<p>That includes sending kids home as soon as they show symptoms, and parents must have a plan for someone to pick them up and care for them at home.</p>
<p>"We've made it very clear to parents that they have to have a child care plan if we have to send (students) home," said Louis Riel superintendent Terry Borys. "We will ask students to leave -- we will be requiring parents to pick up students who are ill."</p>
<p>Any student or staff showing flu symptoms will have to go to a separate room until ready to leave, said Borys.</p>
<p>Every classroom in Seven Oaks School Division has a spray bottle of hand sanitizer sitting on the teacher's desk or handy to everyone on a counter.</p>
<p>Pembina Trails School Division has hand sanitizer in every classroom, and Louis Riel is awaiting a shipment ordered in August.</p>
<p>In Seven Oaks, custodians are doing less floor-sweeping and a lot more disinfecting of doorknobs, bannisters and water fountains.</p>
<p>Students and teachers are encouraged to wash their hands with soap and water frequently, says superintendent Brian O'Leary.</p>
<p>But no school can make itself completely safe from H1N1, warned O'Leary.</p>
<p>"We're reducing the risk, we're not eliminating it," he said.</p>
<p>"We are making hand sanitizers available to schools as they need it," placing them in every classroom, Lussier said. "Our kindergarten classrooms all have bathroom facilities and sinks" and all labs have sinks and water.</p>
<p>Each classroom also has spray bottles of disinfectant to clean desks, doorknobs and other areas frequently.</p>
<p>O'Leary said it was impractical to ask parents to send hand sanitizers with their kids.</p>
<p>"Where we want parents engaged is in proper handwashing, cough etiquette, keeping them home when sick," said O'Leary.</p>
<p>O'Leary was uncertain if kids would exert peer pressure to have everyone use the hand sanitizers or wash with soap and water frequently. Seven Oaks allows 10 minutes between high school classes, leaving plenty of time for proper handwashing.</p>
<p>"We hope it just becomes a routine for kids, that they do it without thinking about it," he said.</p>
<p>In Louis Riel, older students demonstrate proper handwashing techniques to the little kids, who wash with soap and water as a daily routine.</p>
<p>Borys said Louis Riel held an in-service for custodians Sept. 2. There are procedures for cleaning shared equipment such as musical instruments and computers. "The message was, be extra-diligent with common areas, like doorknobs and desks," Borys said.</p>
<p>City divisions believe they have enough qualified substitute teachers, including retired teachers, to get through the pandemic without using unqualified non-teachers in the classroom, which rural schools expect to do.</p>
<p>"We have quite an extensive substitute list," Lussier said. "We don't plan to use unqualified people in a teaching role."</p>
<p>Superintendents stressed that Manitoba Health will make any calls on closing schools.</p>
<p>Officials say that Manitoba Health has told pregnant teachers to be extra-vigilant about handwashing and disinfecting, but expects them to work during a pandemic if they are not ill.</p>
<p>So far, there are no plans to reduce large gatherings of students, though the pandemic plans call for the possibility of teachers rotating classrooms where feasible, and cancelling some extracurricular activities.</p>
<p>"There is provision for cancelling large events and gatherings," said Borys, and there is even a procedure for holding school board meetings by teleconference if trustees become ill.</p>
<p>nick.martin@freepress.mb.ca</p>
<p>"PUBLICLY identifying schools is not normal practice and is not planned for H1N1. There is no public-health reason to publicly identify schools with unusual absenteeism.</p>
<p>"... There is also no set absenteeism rate where schools report to Manitoba Health because we are looking for unusual rates -- this can vary between schools. Once the department receives a report of unusual absenteeism, a public-health investigation and appropriate public-health followup takes place within the school and/or the community -- depending on the situation.</p>
<p>"If there were a public-health reason to identify a school, it can be done but in most cases, public-health followup is only needed within the facility. It's important to recognize that by the time an unusual level of absenteeism is reached, the illness has likely already circulated throughout the school community.</p>
<p>"We have to assume H1N1 will be found in all Manitoba communities during the second wave this fall and winter -- as was the case earlier this year. We also expect it to be found in all facilities (schools included), so confirming a case does not change the public health advice that we give...</p>
<p>"If the situation changes and there is a public-health reason to identify a school, a facility or a community, then we would do so, and have the power under the Public Health Act to do that."</p>
<p>BOTH Seven Oaks and Pembina Trails school divisions have piggybacked on an enormous amount of online pandemic-preparedness information gathered by River East Transcona School Division. One place to find it is: www.pembinatrails.ca/Documents/REVISED%20Sep%2022-09%20Pandemic%20Plan%20-%20Pembina%20Trails%20School%20Division.pdf[http://www.pembinatrails.ca/Documents/REVISED%20Sep%2022-09%20Pandemic%20Plan%20-%20Pembina%20Trails%20School%20Division.pdf]</p>

<p>WASAGAMACK, MAN. -- When Yvonne MacDougall learned about the body bags, she sat down and wept.</p>
<p>She wept for her chief, father to his people, who channelled their collective rage by returning the body bags to Winnipeg. And she wept because she can do so little to protect the 14 members of her home from a virus that stalks people like them.</p>
<p>With no running water, no sewer and no money to buy supplies such as hand sanitizer, she's had but one precaution at her disposal.</p>
<p>“We stopped keeping a slop pale inside,” she said. “You have to go, you go to the outhouse. Doesn't matter how cold it is.”</p>
<p>Many residents throughout this 2,000-member reserve have removed the buckets, one of the few H1N1 prophylactics within their means. For months, native chiefs in this area, a hive of lethal flu activity in spring, have implored the federal government for help in stocking homes with sanitation supplies.</p>
<p>When Health Canada instead shipped up to 200 body bags to Wasagamack – where preparing for death is a cultural taboo – the mix of humiliation and rage quickly boiled over.</p>
<p>The chiefs' continued protests have become a federal political issue, prompting indignation from opposition leaders, a rare government apology and Health Canada's assurances that northern communities are well equipped to fight the autumn resurgence of H1N1 – an absurd claim to anyone who has taken the 600-kilometre plane and water-taxi trip here from Winnipeg. As this remote town influences the national agenda, the nation's influence here is negligible.</p>
<p>“It is our culture to accept hardship,” said Victor Harper, Ms. MacDougall's brother. “And as I pray the worst is over, I know in my heart it's not.”</p>
<p>On a recent weekday, most of the town had emptied out for moose-hunting season as Mr. Harper bucked his creaky Blazer over rutted roads. The school was closed. The band office was locked. Just two people sat in the waiting room at the local nursing station. “It's a bad day to talk to people, but a good day to get in touch with the land,” he said.</p>
<p>Wasagamack chief George Knott signed onto this land, Treaty 5, in 1909, after his people had endured two centuries of smallpox, measles and tuberculosis.</p>
<p>Recent centennial celebrations were held to mark what many residents referred to as “100 years of misery, of promises unkept,” according to Mr. Harper.</p>
<p>Today the average annual wage here – at least for the 30 per cent or so who work – hovers around $15,000.</p>
<p>The body-bag issue only fomented this sense of historical injustice and underscored the harsh reality of life on remote reserves, a reality where Ms. MacDougall's decrepit home – with its plywood-covered windows, blue rain tarps and drafty gaps between mouldy wall and water-damaged floor – is the norm.</p>
<p>Of 240 homes on the reserve, 140 need major repairs or demolition, according to Indian and Northern Affairs.</p>
<p>When Mr. Harper visited his sister around noon last week, the local waterman was filling up 40-gallon drums on Ms. MacDougall's porch, a $30 expense, leaving the four families inside with enough water to last four days.</p>
<p>Bare mattresses leaned against every wall, and two wash basins sat in a corner next to shampoo bottles. In one bedroom, two boys sat on mattresses watching cartoons, steps from a wall engulfed in inky mould.</p>
<p>“Respiratory problems are rampant here,” said Chief Jerry Knott, a descendent of the founding chief. “Hand sanitizer, even if we had it, wouldn't even scratch the surface.”</p>
<p>During the spring H1N1 outbreak, members of northern Manitoba reserves made up a disproportionate percentage of the ill. Of 70 ICU beds in Winnipeg, 60 were occupied by influenza patients – two-thirds of whom were aboriginal. Wasagamack was lucky. While nursing stations in neighbouring St. Theresa Point and Garden Hill teemed with the sick, late ice covering the only route out of town and the band's swift move to seal off the community from outsiders prevented a single case of H1N1 from cropping up here.</p>
<p>But the barriers keeping influenza out could just as easily keep it in. Mr. Harper worries that because Wasagamack averted the spring flu entirely, locals have zero immunity to the disease, the same devastating scenario his ancestors faced in the past. “Maybe Health Canada knows something we don't in delivering these body bags,” he said.</p>
<p>In fading afternoon light, Mr. Harper navigates the potholes leading to Wasagamack's nursing station, a modern facility kept so clean that patients remove their shoes at the door. This is the portal between the spheres, where the Canada of slop pales and wash basins meets the Canada of flush toilets and hot showers. But it's a fickle gateway; the doctor visits just 1½ days a week.</p>
<p>Mr. Harper tries to ask the head nurse some questions about the body bags, but she's curt and gives him a number to call.</p>
<p>Discouraged, he leaves the station and crunches the gravel path to a dock. This was where the body bags came ashore, where his chief found a bill of goods itemizing 200 of the sacks and promptly had them returned to sender. Many said Chief Knott and others were simply making political hay.</p>
<p>“They don't understand,” Mr. Harper said.</p>
<p>“In our culture, we do not prepare for death. A body must lie for two nights. Until that is over we do not build a coffin, we do not dig a grave. You won't see a funeral parlour here for that reason. That is how sacred death is.”</p>
<p>The cultural slight cannot be overstated. Victor Harper wept. One elder, Joseph Harper Sr., said his “whole physical being sunk.” Another, Louis P. Wood, said his heart nearly stopped.</p>
<p>Late in the day, Mr. Harper stopped the Blazer suddenly in front of a poplar grove.</p>
<p>“See that, how the trees are getting yellow; that just happened, just now,” he said, his dismay giving way to joy. Soon the leaves will fall and elders will be scouring the forest for herbal remedies to the flu. “This is our doctor's office. … we cannot rely on the contemporary world to save us.”</p>

<p>H1N1 / THE RESPONSE</p>
<p>With the fall resurgence of H1N1 bearing down, a new Canadian study still in the peer-review process has disrupted flu vaccination plans in most provinces and territories.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, Yukon and Northwest Territories will delay delivery of seasonal flu vaccines to most residents under the age of 65.</p>
<p>Here is the schedule for how the vaccines will be rolled out in these jurisdictions:</p>
<p>Phase 1: October, 2009</p>
<p>Seasonal influenza vaccination will be offered to people 65 years and older, and residents of long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>Phase 2: November, 2009</p>
<p>H1N1 influenza vaccination will be made available to everyone.</p>
<p>Phase 3: DECEMBER, 2009 - JANUARY, 2010</p>
<p>Seasonal influenza vaccination will be offered to everyone under the age of 65.</p>
<p>The rest of Canada</p>
<p>Nunavut and Alberta are expected to make an announcement on their vaccination campaigns later this week.</p>
<p>New Brunswick will not be delaying its regular seasonal flu vaccination, which begins tomorrow.</p>
<p>While most native communities fall under Ottawa's purview, the provinces deliver and administer vaccines.</p>

<p>Canada is facing the H1N1 pandemic in an atmosphere of confusion and doubt, as a result of an unpublished study that no one else in the world has found persuasive. Yet the Canadian authors of the study and the unnamed journal they have written it for are citing the usual academic protocols as a reason for keeping the study from the public. Momentous decisions are being made, but the public is being denied access to the basis for those decisions.</p>
<p>Public-health authorities in this country have not only read the study but responded to it, and the paper has not even been peer-reviewed yet. So it is safe to say the usual protocols are out the window, as they should be when the public's health may be at risk. The public should then be given access to the study, too.</p>
<p>The public is of critical importance in any vaccination plan, but is being treated as if it should accept on trust, or faith, whatever public-health officials in each province decide for them. That is a recipe for failure.</p>
<p>The study found that the seasonal flu vaccine may double the risk of catching H1N1. Most provinces have responded by altering their vaccination plans. They will not offer seasonal vaccine shots, or at least, not until January, when the first wave of swine flu is expected to have passed. New Brunswick, on the other hand, says it will give out seasonal flu shots as it always does.</p>
<p>The decision of the provinces is certainly quick and bold. Whether it is the right decision is open to question. The paper has been shared around the world. It has gone to the World Health Organization, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, and British and Australian authorities. None of them has chosen to act on it. (Some scientists abroad have dubbed it “the Canada problem.”) So who is right? At the moment it is impossible for Canadians to judge.</p>
<p>The authors, who include Danuta Skowronski of the British Columbia Centre for Disease Control and Gaston De Serres of Laval University, should explain without constraint the methods and findings. Dr. Skowronski insisted in an interview yesterday that peer review was needed before putting the paper before the public. “The broader public should be informed of results that have withstood scientific scrutiny,” which she expects within four weeks. But why? There seems little chance of hysteria or alarm. The bigger danger is confusion and doubt, which may affect public willingness to show up for the H1N1 vaccine, about which some doubts are developing.</p>
<p>Maybe the “Canada problem” is not the seasonal flu making people more susceptible to H1N1. It's the attitude that major public-health debates should be held in-house, among public-health officials. This country has not had a national town-hall meeting on swine flu, as the United States did, bringing together governors, health and school officials and, notably, the President himself. The public has simply been told Canada has the problem well in hand. Leave public-health policy to the experts, show up on the appointed day and roll up your sleeves.</p>
<p>But what if, having been excluded from the discussion, the public says no?</p>

<div>PANDEMIC PLANNING</div>
<div>Comment</div>
<div id="hd"><b>The courts need surge capacity</b>

<p>In preparing a pandemic bedside triage protocol for H1N1, <span class="companylink">Hamilton Health Sciences</span> has done what we should all do: hope for the best and prepare for the worst. This first Canadian protocol is a courageous attempt to set forth who should receive life-saving care if access becomes limited.</p>
<p>Yet no matter how thoughtful the protocol, it could become subject to legal challenge at the height of a pandemic. Litigation by loved ones in an attempt to move a patient up the triage hierarchy could prove disastrous if the judiciary is not ready. Two recent legal cases have shown that the judiciary's response can create serious challenges to hospitals providing intensive care.</p>
<p>In the case of Calgary's Zongwu Jin, in 2007, the family sued to ensure that intensive-care physicians would attempt resuscitation if their father required it. The physician believed it would put Mr. Jin, 66, in a persistent vegetative state. The Calgary court temporarily ruled in favour of the family, so he was kept in an ICU bed for four days, not because he needed it (he was ready for transfer to a less expensive bed) but because the court had granted a temporary order pending a full hearing.</p>
<p>The point isn't that there was disagreement, but that the process of resolving the disagreement created other serious problems. Although four days is a brief time when measured by the ordinary workings of the legal system, hours count in a medical setting that operates around the clock, usually to capacity, even without an epidemic.</p>
<p>The second case, also in 2007, had even more serious effects. It concerned Samuel Golubchuk, an 84-year-old Winnipeg man whose children sued in order to prevent physicians from removing his artificial ventilation and feeding.</p>
<p>Despite a nurse's testimony that Mr. Golubchuk had 45 litres of excess fluid leaking from his body, the judge granted a temporary injunction requiring that Mr. Golubchuk continue to receive intensive care. More to the point, the court took two months to rule on the temporary injunction and scheduled the trial 10 months after the initial application. Mr. Golubchuk died four months before trial. No law was developed to guide future disputes.</p>
<p>These two cases allocated the scarce medical resource of intensive care on legal procedural grounds: Pending a full hearing, the judgments sought to preserve the status quo. But in medicine, “the status quo” is an elusive concept. A delayed decision can be an actual decision. By ruling that Mr. Golubchuk should stay in the ICU for 10 months before a trial could begin, the court was actually deciding on overall management of the unit, and created a situation in which two intensive-care physicians quit. A decision that was ostensibly about one patient had definite, but unreported, effects on many other patients who were not represented in the initial hearing.</p>
<p>Now imagine what the repercussions could be during a pandemic. The Hamilton protocol aims to protect both the rights of patients and the moral consciences of health-care professionals by creating a committee to make impossible choices in situations of unimaginable stress.</p>
<p>Some are bound to disagree with the pandemic committee's decisions. If families legally challenge the protocol or its application, judges ought to accelerate the decision-making process to minimize the strain on intensive-care units. Moreover, judges should take into consideration the population as a whole and individuals at risk of being bumped, even if they are not represented by counsel.</p>
<p>The first principle of the Hamilton protocol is to “build ICU surge capacity.” Recent legal cases suggest that pandemic preparedness also requires the creation of judicial surge capacity. Courts, like hospitals, must both hope for the best and prepare for the worst.</p>

<p>Recent SP columns by Mark Lemstra negatively examined such medical measures as drug therapy and vaccination.</p>
<p>In the most recent article he questioned the effectiveness of vaccination. Tell that to the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and Rotary International which, by conducting an intensive vaccination program, are close to eliminating polio from all the less privileged countries.</p>
<p>Media have a responsibility to publish balanced and accurate information on medical issues. In view of recent media obsession with the H1N1 virus and forthcoming availability of an appropriate vaccine, a balanced discussion of vaccination is essential.</p>

<p>Fear of a potential H1N1 outbreak has some groups in the city washing their hands of tradition in favour of flu prevention.</p>
<p>From hockey teams to religious gatherings, the threat of a pandemic is causing churches and sporting groups in the city to reconsider their rituals.</p>
<p>At St. Paul's United Church, the congregation has suspended communion for the month of November and will also halt handshaking.</p>
<p>"We're not going to shake hands for flu season," said pastor Marjorie Keyser. As well, the church has put more antibacterial liquid out for parishioners.</p>
<p>Ultimately, she wants people to continue to come and worship, calling the measures a "precaution" to reassure the congregation.</p>
<p>"There can be a lot of fear mongering that goes along with this," she said.</p>
<p>In a new twist on the post-game routine, players in the Saskatoon Minor Hockey League will be asked to leave their gloves on while shaking hands with the other team.</p>
<p>"We're going to continue the tradition, but ask the coaches to ask the kids to keep their gloves on -- more of a hand tap," said Kelly Boes, executive director of Saskatoon Minor Hockey. Players will also be asked to wash after games and not to share water bottles.</p>
<p>Across Canada, a number of Catholic archdioceses have sent a list of guidelines to be implemented during a flu outbreak, which could include emptying holy water fonts and discontinuing shared communion from the chalice.</p>
<p>Measures could also include asking parishioners to refrain from shaking hands while exchanging the "sign of peace" and asking priests to use hand sanitizer.</p>
<p>"We've been receiving a number of calls regarding the sign of peace hand shaking, water fonts, which are communal, and baptisms, as well as the shared communion via the cup," said Leah Perrault, director of pastoral services for the Catholic Diocese of Saskatoon. "Our recommendations will be out by the end of October."</p>
<p>All ministers giving communion are asked to wash their hands first. The diocese intends to follow all recommendations of the Saskatoon Health Region as it monitors cases of the flu.</p>
<p>The Canadian Council of Catholic Bishops is expected to issue directives this week, said Perrault.</p>
<p>Last winter, Saint Anne's Roman Catholic Church suspended communal wine drinking during mass, but resumed after flu season.</p>
<p>"This year each parish is making its own local decision," said Perrault.</p>
<p>The mandate of the diocese for flu season includes taking care of parishioners should a flu outbreak occur and ensuring the flu is not spread through a congregation.</p>
<p>Not much will change for those congregations that use individual disposable cups for communion.</p>
<p>At the Ebenezer Baptist Church, all forms of greeting will continue, though officials have installed additional hand sanitizing dispensers as a precaution.</p>
<p>"We're a family when we get together," said pastor Bryan Conrad.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, 78 H1N1-related deaths had been reported in Canada.</p>

<p>Restricted travel from Canada to Mexico over swine-flu fears and stiffer border policies between Canada and the U.S. caused tourism spending to drop for the fourth-straight quarter, Statistics Canada said. Tourism spending fell 0.8 per cent in the second quarter of 2009, bringing the total decline to 2.9 per cent over the last four quarters.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mandatory flu shots rile health workers; 'Invasive Procedure'</b>
</div><div>Tom Blackwell   </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>773 words</div><div>30 September 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved.   </div>

<p>As most Canadian hospitals and other health-care organizations prod their workers to get the influenza vaccine, some institutions have taken the aggressive stance of making the flu shot mandatory for nurses and other employees.</p>
<p>Managers at the agencies say compulsory shots are sometimes the only way to boost abysmal vaccine rates among health workers -- and better protect their vulnerable patients. A recent labour-arbitration ruling in Ontario upheld the mandatory strategy, despite complaints from unions that it is a violation of their members' rights.</p>
<p>The ruling was triggered by grievances against North Bay General in Ontario, which two years ago became probably the first hospital in Canada to implement compulsory flu immunization. "Some workers didn't agree with our policy, and that was voiced," said Kim Carter, the hospital's infection-control co-ordinator. "[But] the decision of taking or not taking an influenza vaccine has an impact on our patients.... We would strongly support and encourage all other hospitals to do this."</p>
<p>Several nurses ended up going on unpaid leave rather than be immunized, then filed union grievances. Vaccine compliance among staff has since jumped from 50% to more than 90%, and there has not been a single flu outbreak within the hospital in the past two seasons, something that would happen every year in the past, Ms. Carter said.</p>
<p>Even as the country braces for a possible wave of the H1N1 pandemic flu, however, unions argue that forced vaccination is unjustified and insist they will fight it in the courts if necessary. "It's an invasive procedure," said Linda Silas, president of the Canadian Federation of Nurses' Unions. "Don't get me wrong: we recommend vaccination.... The issue is the mandatory. It has to be an individual decision."</p>
<p>And yet, years of promoting voluntary vaccination among health workers has met with limited success. Hospitals and nursing homes are full of the</p>
<p>people most likely to be killed or made seriously ill by the flu -- the chronically sick, elderly, pregnant and very young--but staff vaccination rates hover around 40% or 50%, said Dr. Allison McGeer, one of the country's leading flu experts.</p>
<p>Dr. McGeer, head of infection control at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital, said her own hospital is still trying to use persuasion to get more of its employees vaccinated, with the rate standing now at around 64%, but said she supports mandatory shots.</p>
<p>"Would we let a pilot with heart disease fly a plane?" she asked. "Letting health-care workers work without vaccination is similar to that."</p>
<p>The North Bay hospital requires all employees to be vaccinatedor takepreventivedoses of anti-viral medicine once the local public-health office declares an outbreak in the community, as occurs most years in locations across the country. Those who refuse to be vaccinated cannot come to work, taking vacation or overtime days if they have them, unpaid leave if they do not. Close to a dozen public-health departments in Ontario have adopted similar policies for their workers.</p>
<p>At the Haliburton Kawartha Pine Ridge Health Unit in eastern Ontario, new employees must actually agree to be vaccinated as a condition of employment, said Dr. Lynn Noseworthy, the medical officer of health. The result of all that and other measures: 100% compliance among staff whose jobs take them regularly to nursing homes, hospitals and the residences of pregnant women, new mothers and people with serious illness like tuberculosis, Dr. Noseworthy said: "You would not want to be adding to their illness by bringing influenza into their homes."</p>
<p>The 10 nursing homes run by Alberta's Chinook Health Region have a similar policy, endorsed by an arbitrator in a 2002 grievance ruling. Government officials in this country have generally voiced lilttle interest in mandating flu shots.</p>
<p>Linda Haslam-Stroud, president of the Ontario Nurses Association, says the union generally endorses flu vaccination, on a voluntary basis. She notes the vaccine is not devoid of side effects, including rare cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, which can cause temporary paralysis. "We have members who have taken the vaccine who will never work again, and not just in nursing," she said.</p>
<p>Dr. McGeer dismisses fears about Guillain-Barre, noting at most one in every million or two million people who receive the vaccine will contract the syndrome, and among that number, the mortality rate is 3%.</p>

<p>There is a new casualty in the battle to combat the spread of the H1N1 flu virus: holy water.</p>
<p>In parishes from Edmonton to Quebec City, churchgoers are being advised that holy water fonts -- traditionally kept near the church entrance, where parishioners can dip their fingers in and bless themselves before entering a pew -- should remain empty during the flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"In some churches the holy water is changed frequently, but there are churches that leave it there for months, turning [it] into culture fluid," said Jean Pelletier, chancellor of the diocese of Quebec City, citing growing anxiety among churchgoers about the potential spread of H1N1.</p>
<p>"There is a risk it could spread bacteria and weaken the immune system, so as a precaution, we have removed all holy water."</p>
<p>A lengthy note to parishioners on the Catholic Archdiocese of Edmonton's website also cautions against the use of holy water, instead urging that "alcohol-based hand sanitizing solution and tissues" be made available at church entrances.</p>
<p>With about six dozen H1N1-related deaths reported in Canada to date, fears about the virus have gripped the country.</p>
<p>The ban on holy water is only one of a number of flu guidelines issued by archdioceses in Toronto, Ottawa, Montreal, Winnipeg, Gatineau, Quebec and Edmonton.</p>
<p>As many as 5,000 parishes could be affected, though it is up to each parish to decide which, if any, of the guidelines they will put into practice, said a spokesman with the Canadian Conference of Catholic Bishops.</p>
<p>Suggestions range from encouraging parishioners with flu symptoms to stay at home, to replacing the traditional "sign of peace" handshake with a slight bow or a nod, to forgoing taking the Communion host directly on the tongue.</p>
<p>In other cases, archdioceses are suggesting that parishioners be trained to lead a service in the event that a priest falls ill. "It's common sense," said Ginette Chaumont with the Archdiocese of Ottawa. "A lot of people gather for Mass and measures had to be taken.</p>

</p>
<p>This week's list is a compilation of betting odds that we found at various online sports books. Remember, betting can make anything exciting -- even a Blue Jays game!</p>
<p>Who will win the 2010 Stanley Cup?</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the Pittsburgh Penguins are the favourites at +494, meaning a $100 bet on the defending champions stands to win $494.</p>
<p>After the Pens, it goes Detroit (+645), San Jose (+882), Boston (+1,089), Chicago (+1,097), and Vancouver (+1,235).</p>
<p>Yes, you read that correctly -- the Canucks are the sixth heaviest favourites to hoist the Cup. Apparently, when you have a world-class goalie, two top-15 scorers, some up-and-coming youngsters and a deep, offensive-minded back end, people expect big things. It's like we're finally through the looking glass or something.</p>
<p>Which teams are the longest shots?</p>
<p>Atlanta and Colorado, both at +12,211.</p>
<p>Follow-up question: How many NBA teams are currently longer shots to win a title than the Thrashers and Avs?</p>
<p>The answer is 14. "The NBA: Where Parity Does Not Happen."</p>
<p>Who will play in the Stanley Cup final?</p>
<p>One sports book has odds on myriad matchups. Here's a sample:</p>
<p>Toronto-Vancouver (120/1): A series so huge it would literally shake Canada to its core, sending the country adrift into the Arctic Ocean. "We cannot let this happen," says David Suzuki.</p>
<p>Montreal-Edmonton (200/1): Big series, small players.</p>
<p>Carolina-Nashville (240/1): To coincide with riots across Canada.</p>
<p>New York Rangers-Los Angeles (300/1): The Gary Bettman conspiracy pick. We're talking about the two biggest TV markets in the U.S. here. Maybe a few refs are told to do some ... stuff.</p>
<p>Atlanta-Colorado (1,000/1): Betting on this is also referred to as "making a donation to a sports book."</p>
<p>Who will win the NHL scoring race?</p>
<p>No big shockers in the favourites category: Evgeni Malkin, the reigning Art Ross winner (113 points), is the leader at 5/2, followed by Alex Ovechkin (3/1), Sidney Crosby (4/1), Pavel Datsyuk and Joe Thornton (both 7/1).</p>
<p>Further down the list is where things get, uh, optimistic.</p>
<p>Atlanta Thrashers centre Todd White is at 100/1. His inclusion on the list is surprising to everybody, including Todd White.</p>
<p>Another Atlanta forward, Vyacheslav Kozlov, is at 67/1. Kozlov is 37 years old and has never had more than 80 points in a season. If you're betting on Kozlov to win the scoring race, you might as well parlay it with "Swine Flu Ravages NHL, Kozlov OK Though (+10,000)".</p>
<p>Which country will win the most gold medals at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver?</p>
<p>Time to hammer the panic button, Canada's not the favourite. It's Germany at 2/1, then Russia (5/1), then the U.S. (5.5/1), and finally Canada, tied with Norway at 6/1.</p>
<p>In a related story, the following Olympic events have been cancelled: Everything except hockey and curling.</p>
<p>Who will be the next celebrity to invest in an NFL team?</p>
<p>Here's a wager that's inspired by singer/human scarecrow Marc Anthony, who along with a number of other celebrities recently bought a stake in the Miami Dolphins.</p>
<p>We have to say there's some questionable handicapping by this particular sports book, which lists Adam Sandler at 33/1 to buy a stake in the Patriots despite the fact he's a diehard Jets fans. It also suggests that part of the Cleveland Browns could be purchased by Arsenio Hall (41/1), who hasn't been a celebrity since 1994. We suppose Tara Reid (67/1) could take a piece of the Eagles. No wait, other way 'round. These are all terrible.</p>
<p>Who will win Season 9 of Dancing with the Stars?</p>
<p>The favourite? Donny Osmond at 3/1.</p>
<p>The long shot? Tom Delay at 75/1.</p>
<p>The designated football player? Michael Irvin at 22/1.</p>
<p>The guy you'd never expect to see ballroom dancing? Chuck Liddell at 28/1.</p>
<p>The fact people watch this garbage? Unbelievable at 1/100.</p>

<p>British Columbia continues to be fertile ground for the University of Washington golf program.</p>
<p>Charlie Hughes of Maple Ridge made a favourable impression in his debut at the Ping-Golfweek Preview tourney held in UW's backyard at Gold Mountain near Seattle.</p>
<p>Although he struggled in Monday's final round, when he shot a six-over 78, the Thomas Haney graduate still managed to crack the top 20, finishing tied for 19th at seven-over par. He had begun the day tied for fifth.</p>
<p>The Huskies were led by Abbotsford senior Nick Taylor, who tied for tenth despite shooting an 80 in Sunday's second round. Taylor rebounded nicely with a three-under 69 on Monday.</p>
<p>Langley's Darren Wallace tied for 19th for the Huskies, who finished second, 22 shots behind tournament winner Oklahoma State in the 15-team event.</p>
<p>THE CLAN IS BACK: After a three-year hiatus, Simon Fraser University made its return to collegiate golf this past weekend. SFU competed at the St. Martin's University tournament in Lacey, Wash., where the Clan finished 15th in the 19-team event.</p>
<p>SFU is competing in the NAIA this year, but next year will join NCAA Division II and compete in the Great Northwest Athletic Conference.</p>
<p>St. Martin's captured its own tournament, with a seven-over total of 583. UBC finished tied for fourth place nine shots back. University of Victoria placed sixth.</p>
<p>All three B.C. teams are competing at this week's Western Washington University event in Bellingham.</p>
<p>The new SFU men's team includes Gavin Symmans of Vernon, Gord Swenson of Richmond, Nate Beauchamp of Burnaby, Adam Karim of Coquitlam, Ahmed Amlani of Surrey, Michael Lawrence of Richmond and Douglas Cheung of Richmond.</p>
<p>TOP OF THE WORLD: Canadian Tour regulars Graham DeLaet and Stuart Anderson won a qualifier in Estonia this past weekend to earn a spot for Canada in the Omega Mission Hills World Cup.</p>
<p>DeLaet and Anderson finished the event at 19-under 269. That was two shots better than Wales. Scotland grabbed the third and final qualifying spot for the World Cup, which goes Nov. 26-29 at the Mission Hills resort in China.</p>
<p>TOP 10 FOR GILLIS: Williams Lake native Mitch Gillis was the top Canadian, finishing tied for tenth at the Canadian Tour's Iberostar Riviera Maya Open in Mexico this past weekend.</p>
<p>Gillis finished the event at four-under par, eight shots behind winner Rafael Gomez of Argentina. Langley's James Allenby had his best finish in his rookie year with a tie for 14th.</p>
<p>The Canadian Tour wraps up its Mexican swing, which was rescheduled after last spring's swine flu outbreak, with this week's $125,000 Riviera Nayarit Classic near Puerto Vallarta.</p>
<p>CHIP SHOTS: Victoria's Alison Murdoch won her fourth Irish Senior Women's Championship earlier this month. Murdoch followed up that result with a tie for eighth at the British Senior Ladies Open ... Kelowna's Samantha Richdale, who earned full-time status on next year's LPGA Tour with a solid year on the Duramed Futures Tour, has a spot in this week's <span class="companylink">Navistar</span> LPGA Classic in Prattville, Ala.</p>

</div><div>Gary Kingston   </div>
<div>Vancouver Sun</div>
<div>462 words</div><div>29 September 2009</div><div>Vancouver Sun</div><div>VNCS</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Vancouver Sun   </div>
</p>
<p>The athletes' village at an Olympic Games is often a collegial place where figure skaters, bobsledders, skiers and snowboarders who might be fierce competitors on the field of play will share a warm embrace in the name of friendship or respect.</p>
<p>But medical officials with the Canadian Olympic Committee, mindful of the heightened concerns about the H1N1 virus, are being proactive in trying to encourage a "changing of the culture" for 2010.</p>
<p>Washing hands frequently, using hand sanitizers and avoiding close contact may not be enough. Dr. Bob McCormack, the COC's chief medical officer, says that instead of shaking hands or greeting foreign athletes with cheek-to-cheek kisses, Canadians should consider an "elbow tap, or just give the nod. Or maybe you come up with your own team thing to minimize the risk.</p>
<p>"Quebec athletes do the cheek-to-cheek thing all the time. It's pretty routine. Maybe you just do the fly by. You don't have to make contact."</p>
<p>McCormack said individuals and teams should start practising different greetings now, so it's not a "foreign concept and not a distraction for the Games."</p>
<p>The B.C.-based McCormack, who notes that the Olympics are seen as the place "where viruses of the world come to meet," says he hasn't yet talked about the idea directly with chief medical officers for other Olympic committees. And he jokingly suggested that perhaps Canadians should keep the plan to themselves and "call it homefield advantage."</p>
<p>Meantime, McCormack says the "shifting sands" around concerns that a seasonal flu shot increases the chances of contracting H1N1 has made it challenging to come up with a plan for Canadian athletes and coaches.</p>
<p>He noted that the study has not been peer-reviewed and that there are other clinical trials going on.</p>
<p>Several provinces have suspended flu shots for anyone younger than 65.</p>
<p>"It's all a bit murky," McCormack said Monday. "But even if we come up with a recommendation, which we will, it will be based on the best available evidence when the dust has settled."</p>
<p>He said the COC has made a strong recommendation to athletes and coaches to get the H1N1 vaccine, suggesting they have an obligation to protect not only themselves, but also their teammates.</p>
<p>As for seasonal flu shots, "we're waiting for the experts to guide us."</p>
<p>Before the Turin Olympics in 2006, 76 per cent of Canadian athletes and 66 per cent of coaches and support staff had a seasonal flu vaccine.</p>

</p>
<p>Whistler, B.C., isn't the only place where temperatures are rising over Hell's Kitchen.</p>
<p>Amidst the astonishing ratings gains posted last Tuesday in the U.S. by the return of NCIS and series premieres of NCIS: Los Angeles and The Good Wife, Hell's Kitchen eked out a narrow second-place finish for the Fox network, according to The Hollywood Reporter.</p>
<p>Why should you care? Because the winner of this season's Hell's Kitchen will land a job in the kitchen of Whistler's Araxi Restaurant & Bar under the supervision of world-renowned executive chef James Walt, just in time for the 2010 Olympics.</p>
<p>Hell's Kitchen may be a blast to watch -- chef Gordon Ramsay's legendary temper and colourful use of euphemisms may yet cost him the knighthood he reportedly covets -- but the stakes are sky high this time around.</p>
<p>Chef Ramsay himself has said the Araxi job is the best prize yet in Hell's Kitchen's six seasons so far, even as the program's ratings continue to heat up in the U.S., where Hell's Kitchen is now one of the Fox network's most reliable summer and winter performers.</p>
<p>The field of contestants is now down to five would-be Araxi chefs -- the obvious losers have been tossed out like yesterday's leftovers -- and now things get serious.</p>
<p>In tonight's outing, chef Ramsay challenges the remaining chefs to create a dish that looks as good as it tastes. It's Hell's Kitchen's first individual challenge of the season and it's based on the notion that, while looks aren't everything, they count for a lot. Culinary experts from Bon Appetit magazine weigh in with their opinion alongside chef Ramsay, but their language is a little more genteel.</p>
<p>Hell's Kitchen's final reveal is Oct. 13, by the way. And, no, it's not a Friday. (7p.m., Citytv; 8 p.m., Fox)</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>This Hour Has 22 Minutes (now known as just 22 Minutes) is billing itself as "unfair and unbalanced" as the multi-Gemini-winning mock news program returns for a 17th season -- but that isn't entirely fair. The problem for fans who like their faux news with a little meat on the bone is that, too often, 22 Minutes isn't unfair or unbalanced enough. Mark Critch, Gavin Crawford, Geri Hall and Cathy Jones are back, baby, with a look at "the real Stephen Harper" -- as opposed to "the unreal Stephen Harper?" -- and help the media do even more to spread unnecessary panic about the H1N1 flu virus. (8:30 p.m., CBC)</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>If you saw The Good Wife last week, you already know this legal drama starring Julianna Margulies as a middle-aged mom and soon-to-be ex-wife has raised the bar for the fall's freshman series. In tonight's followup, Alicia Florrick (Margulies) tries to untangle the coverup surrounding an exotic dancer's claims she was sexually assaulted at a businessman's bachelor party. Don't assume you know how it turns out. Based on last week's early evidence, The Good Wife may not be as predictable as you think. (10 p.m., CBS, Global)</p>

<p>B.C. and P.E.I. join move</p>
<p>to delay flu shot program</p>
<p>British Columbia and Prince Edward Island have joined a growing list of provinces that will delay part of their seasonal flu shot programs this year, decisions that are partially fuelled by concerns raised by controversial and unpublished Canadian research. The study, by scientists in British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario, suggests people who got a flu shot last year were twice as likely to catch H1N1 flu this year as people who didn't get the flu shot. Researchers in the U.S., Australia and Britain have looked for and haven't seen the same effect.</p>

<p>Man in ‘double jeopardy' over security certificate: lawyers</p>
<p>Slapping an Egyptian man the government accuses of terrorism links with a third national security certificate amounted to double jeopardy, his lawyers argued Monday. In any event, they said, continuing to proceed against Mahmoud Jaballah 10 years after he was first detained is an abuse of process that the courts must stop now as a matter of fairness to him and his family. The government first arrested Jaballah, 47, in 1999 under a national security certificate on the grounds that he was a member of the Egyptian al-Jihad, committed to the violent overthrow of the Egyptian government, and should be deported. The government stands by those allegations, which Jaballah denies.</p>

<p>Quebec's Liberal premier gets green light to raise revenue</p>
<p>As Canadian provinces try to pull their budgets into the black, road tolls, higher post-secondary tuition and candy-bar taxes might be the ticket that gets them there. Quebec Premier Jean Charest has been given a green light from his Liberal party to raise government revenue on several fronts - everything from boosting electricity rates to introducing new excise taxes on booze and energy drinks. Charest said despite receiving the nod of support over the weekend, there will be no additional charges for Quebecers before the issue has been debated in public.</p>

Now that the investigation has been completed, all that is left is a 30-day waiting period in case anyone has any concerns about the win and wants to come forward. If there are no objections, the couple will collect their prize Oct. 28.</p>

<p>Catholics take steps</p>
<p>to ward off H1N1</p>
<p>Catholic churches in the Ottawa area are taking extreme measures to curb the spread of the H1N1 virus, including restricting who receives wine during communion and how offerings are received.</p>
<p>In guidelines sent to parishes in the Archdiocese of Ottawa, church officials suggest holy fonts be drained of water, the sprinkling of holy water be avoided and parishioners refrain from shaking hands during the Rite of Peace. Because money can carry germs, churches should consider emptying collection baskets into sealed plastic envelopes, the guidelines say.</p>

<p>A sentence is expected Tuesday in the court martial of 24-year-old Cpl. Matthew Wilcox of Glace Bay, N.S., who was convicted of negligent performance of duty and criminal negligence causing the 2007 death of Cpl. Kevin Megeney of Stellarton, N.S.</p>

<p>"We are currently in the process of developing a pandemic plan for our church ... because of swine flu," says parish nurse Beth MacKay Reilly, who also oversees pastoral care at Central Presbyterian Church. She says they began compiling the plan in the spring.</p>
<p>It has yet to be passed by the elders, but the plan involves various considerations such as finding a way to keep the pieces of bread for communion from being touched by more than one person, possibly by putting each piece in mini cups the way the sacramental wine is served at the church.</p>
<p>The plan also looks at communication strategies with congregants should public gatherings, like Sunday meetings, need to be cancelled.</p>
<p>The Hamilton Conference of the United Church of Canada is also finalizing a pandemic plan for its churches, mostly dealing with staffing issues that would arise, said executive secretary Fred Monteith.</p>
<p>Several Hamilton churches said they were adding hand sanitizers or increasing the number they already have and stepping up efforts to encourage congregants to wash their hands more often.</p>

<p>Hamilton plans to hire more than 185 people from temporary-help agencies to help administer as many as 800,000 swine-flu shots without sacrificing other public health services this fall.</p>
<p>Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, medical officer of health, told city councillors yesterday that outsourcing some of the work would also be cheaper than reassigning staff.</p>
<p>Richardson said the province wants local health departments to be ready to immunize 80 per cent of the population against the H1N1 flu virus, using a vaccine that might require two doses over eight weeks. In Hamilton, that would mean 400,000 people each getting two shots.</p>
<p>Doing it will require five sites across the city, three fixed and two rotating, each with 65 clerical and nursing staff a day, for a total of 325. Council, sitting as the Board of Health, approved a plan to use 140 internal staff and 185 from agencies. Richardson hopes the province will pay a per-dose subsidy to offset extra costs that could go as high as $2.4 million.</p>
<p>Richardson said planning is difficult because she doesn't know when the vaccine will be available or whether two doses will be required. Research elsewhere indicates one may be enough for people 18 to 50, but it's not clear whether it will provide immunity for a sufficiently long time. There's also no way of knowing how many people will choose to be immunized.</p>

<p>SAFINA HUMBLED</p>
<p>World No. 1 Dinara Safina suffered a stunning 7-6, 4-6, 7-5 defeat to Taiwanese qualifier Chang Kai-chen at the Pan Pacific Open Monday. Second seed Venus Williams also lost her opening match, toppled 7-6, 7-5 by Russian Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in front of an empty Tokyo centre court. Earlier, Maria Sharapova beat Italy's Fran-cesca Schiavone 4-6, 7-5, 6-1.</p>
<p>QUERREY OUT OF PLAY</p>
<p>American Sam Querrey will miss the next four to six weeks of the ATP season after cutting his right forearm in an accident in Bangkok. Querrey, seeded third and ranked 25th in the world, suffered the injury after practising for the Thailand Open when he sat on a glass table and fell through it, requiring emergency surgery.</p>
<p>WOODS LIKES AGE MIX</p>
<p>Tiger Woods, fresh from his US$10-million pay day for winning the FedExCup, said he was energized by the mix of younger players in the U.S. squad for next month's Presidents Cup. "This Presidents Cup is different. Lucas (Glover, the U.S. Open winner) and Sean (O'Hair) and AK (Anthony Kim) and Hunter (Mahan) -- it's a mixed generation of players," Woods said of the team that will play against the Internationals in matches in San Francisco starting Oct. 8.</p>
<p>BOLT SAYS NO TO NFL</p>
<p>Three-time Olympic and world sprint champion Usain Bolt of Jamaica said Monday he expects years of fast feats to ease doping doubts in athletics and has no plans to play American football. "I have to prove myself to the world, that you can run fast without it," Bolt told ESPN. Bolt also made it clear the gridiron is not in his future, in part because his size would preclude him from his favoured position of running back."They would want me to play wide receiver. They get hit too much. I'm not in the mood to be hit that much."</p>
<p>AVOID CONTACT</p>
<p>The athletes village at a Winter Olympic Games is often a collegial place where figure skaters, bobsledders, skiers and snowboarders who might be fierce competitors on the field of play will share a warm embrace in the name of friendship or respect. But medical officials with the Canadian Olympic Committee, mindful of the heightened concerns about the H1N1 flu virus, are being proactive in trying to encourage a "changing of the culture" for 2010. Dr. Bob McCormack, the COC's chief medical officer, says that instead of shaking hands or greeting foreign athletes with cheek-to-cheek kisses, Canadians should consider an "elbow tap, or just give the nod."</p>
<p>LEBRON, SHAQ TOGETHER</p>
<p>After months of hype, LeBron James and Shaquille O'Neal are finally wearing the same uniform. The superstars, united by an off-season trade, were together Monday as the Cleveland Cavaliers held a media day like none before in the team's 40-year history. Nearly 150 media members chronicled the duo's first day together.</p>
<p>MCMORRIS LEAVES TALKS</p>
<p>The lead negotiator for the locked-out NBA referees removed himself from the talks Monday in hopes of resolving a dispute that threatens to have replacements on the floor this week. Lamell McMorris said his departure was "in the best interest of the NBA referees and the league." NBA commissioner David Stern took himself out of the negotiations earlier this month</p>
<p>TEVEZ LEADS MAN CITY WIN</p>
<p>Manchester City got back to winning ways in the Premier League when two goals by Carlos Tevez inspired a 3-1 home victory over the Argentine's former club West Ham United Monday.</p>
<p>ARENA LEAGUE LAUNCHING</p>
<p>Arena football isn't dead yet. Officials from what will be known as Arena Football 1 said Monday they will have 16 teams ready to play in 2010, including three in former Arena Football League markets: Chicago, Phoenix and Orlando, Fla.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Vaccine policy selfish, shortsighted</b>
</div><div>Amir Attaran   </div>
<div>Special to The Windsor Star</div>
<div>1042 words</div><div>29 September 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Bid farewell to summer, welcome to fall -- and hold on tight for Canada's flu season, which is becoming an incipient international embarrassment.</p>
<p>Because of a single technical decision in the Public Health Agency of Canada -- a decision to use a new but more efficient "adjuvenated" vaccine -- the H1N1 flu vaccine is being deployed in Canada later than other countries. It is a controversial decision.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association Journal recently panned it, because the new, adjuvenated vaccine will take weeks longer than the standard, unadjuvenated vaccine to gain government approval and roll out.</p>
<p>Without timely vaccine, the CMAJ's editors reasoned, persons susceptible to influenza (mainly the old, the very young, and health care workers) could get sick, and perhaps die.</p>
<p>But now hear PHAC's reply: By choosing the more efficient adjuvenated vaccine, Canada consumes less of the global supply of crucial raw material than those choosing the unadjuvenated vaccine, such as the United States.</p>
<p>"Rather than hogging all of that material," explains Canada's chief public health officer, David Butler-Jones, PHAC's way "provides it for the rest of the world."</p>
<p>Nobly Canadian, you might think? Our national mythology is that, unlike greedy Americans, we choose to sacrifice for the common good. And it would be noble, if only it were true.</p>
<p>Canada is not sharing influenza vaccine with the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Not only is that highly selfish of us, but it again calls into question why the most at-risk Canadians are being made to wait for adjuvenated vaccine, when our commitment to providing for others is hypothetical at best.</p>
<p>Recently, as Stephen Harper was tooling around Washington and talking up Canada's virtues, across town a more substantially moral leader, Barack Obama, announced a global plan to donate life-saving influenza vaccines to poor countries in Africa, Asia and elsewhere.</p>
<p>Those donations are likely to be, for many countries, the only vaccine that they get.</p>
<p>Heeding the World Health Organization's call, Australia, Britain, Brazil, France, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and Switzerland also went along with the donation plan.</p>
<p>Canada, however, declined.</p>
<p>So here is the ugly truth of the matter: Even as the Obama administration committed to donate 10 per cent of America's vaccines to less fortunate countries, the Harper government committed to donate zero. All our government will say is that Canada is "committed to collaborating with the World Health Organization," not that, heaven forbid, we would actually share the vaccine they are urgently asking for.</p>
<p>Who's the greedy one now?</p>
<p>Quite how disgraceful this is is difficult to exaggerate.</p>
<p>Unlike the countries actually donating the vaccine, Canada is in a much better place to give some away. Canada possesses one of the world's few influenza vaccine factories, which means that 100 per cent of our needs can be domestically manufactured. Ottawa has a contract with the factory's owner, which gives Canada first dibs on the vaccine ahead of any other country.</p>
<p>With 50.4 million doses of vaccine in Canada's entitlement, and 32 million Canadians, perhaps only half of whom want to be vaccinated, PHAC officials are certainly correct that we have "more than enough for any Canadian that wants to receive it."</p>
<p>Not every country is so privileged.</p>
<p>The United States has too few influenza vaccine factories and imports most of its needs.</p>
<p>Norway has zero factories and imports all its needs.</p>
<p>Brazil is a developing country struggling to afford vaccine for its citizens. Yet those countries are donating 10 per cent of the vaccine they have.</p>
<p>Even <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, the pharmaceutical company, is donating nearly as many doses of vaccine to the World Health Organization as Canada is buying from it.</p>
<p>You might think Canada should hold on to its extra vaccine because, well, you never know. But that reasoning is as scientifically wrong as it is stingy. So long as persons travel internationally -- a fact that is not about to change -- Canada must care about stanching the influenza pandemic elsewhere, lest more of it, or more dangerous strains, eventually travel here.</p>
<p>Donating excess vaccine to poor countries that can't afford it protects our interests.</p>
<p>But hoarding excess vaccine until it goes to pot protects nobody's interests. With disease defences, as frequently with military defences, collective security is the name of this game.</p>
<p>President Obama gets it. As he said to launch the global vaccine donations, "The United States recognizes that, just as this challenge transcends borders, so must our response. We invite other nations to join in this urgent global health effort."</p>
<p>How odd it must have seemed to him that our prime minister travelled to Washington to whinge about "Buy American," while having nothing to say about "Give Canadian."</p>
<p>The Harper government must do better than continue its mean streak. In this, and much else to do with international aid, poorer foreigners notice Canada's new beggar-thy-neighbour attitude, and wonder how a country once known for its generosity has fallen so far.</p>
<p>The usual preening about Canadian internationalism is nonsense, where WHO has justly called on Canada to share a life-saving resource, and we refuse.</p>
<p>So when will those foreigners start complaining out loud about Canada's churlishness?</p>
<p>Perhaps sometime around the giving season known as Christmas. That is, traditionally, just before the peak of influenza incidence in the northern hemisphere, where most of the world's people live.</p>
<p>If Canada's government has not donated by then, we are at substantial risk of not just influenza, but of making international asses of ourselves.</p>

</p>
<p>Five months after anxiety about swine flu prompted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's government to order the slaughter of all the country's 300,000 hogs, the organic waste they once devoured is piling up on streets, contributing to a garbage crisis.</p>
<p>The government's action destroyed the livelihood of about 70,000 families known as zabaleen -- Arabic for trash collectors -- who were freelance trash collectors and urban pig farmers.</p>
<p>It forced all pork processors and retail outlets to close and created a potential health hazard as neighbourhoods reek of decaying garbage. Some residents, concerned that yesterday's discarded kebab might become tomorrow's cholera outbreak, are burning refuse in bonfires.</p>
<p>"No one took into consideration the economics, much less the environmental problems" the pig cull would create, said Magdi Fouad, 47, whose pork-processing and sales business, founded by his grandfather in 1945, was wiped out overnight.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Microchip spots cancer, quickly and painlessly; U of T scientists' device finds prostate tumours -- no biopsies needed</b>
</div><div>Joseph Hall and Megan Ogilvie </div>
<div>Toronto Star</div>
<div>736 words</div><div>28 September 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A01</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star </div>
</p>
<p>Toronto researchers have developed a portable device they say will accurately diagnose prostate cancer in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>The microchip technology, created by a pair of University of Toronto scientists, will be able to determine the severity of the tumours through a simple urine sample and produce quick diagnosis with no need for painful biopsies.</p>
<p>Now heading into the engineering stage, a BlackBerry-sized device should be available for doctors' use within two to three years and eventually could be tuned to detect a broad range of cancers and infectious ailments, the researchers say.</p>
<p>"The goal would be to produce a result ... while you're sitting in the waiting room," said engineering professor Ted Sargent, who holds the U of T's Canada Research Chair in Nanotechnology.</p>
<p>A paper on the work was published yesterday in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.</p>
<p>The device uses a fingertip-sized microchip - fitted with microscopic meshing - programmed to detect DNA sequences and proteins uniquely produced by specific cancers or pathogens.</p>
<p>These "biomarkers" would be drawn from urine or blood samples.</p>
<p>"We simply put a sample on the chip and we have a nice small chip reader that then analyses it and tells you what markers are in the sample," said Shana Kelley, a U of T pharmacology professor and study co-author.</p>
<p>Detected markers can tell you not only which kind of cancer is present, but also the stage and severity the tumour has attained.</p>
<p>"That's very important to be able to do that because cancers are actually a bunch of different diseases with different levels of aggressiveness," said Kelley. "Particularly in prostate cancer, there are very non-aggressive forms ... that you simply want to leave alone."</p>
<p>Kelley said the technology could herald an age of surgery-free diagnosis for cancer patients. "The real drive is toward non-invasive diagnostics so we can just screen people without having to take parts of their organs in order to do it," she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Tom Hudson, scientific director of the Ontario Institute for Cancer Research, said the study is "proof of principle" that it is possible to have a quick, affordable technology that can test for different cancer biomarkers at once.</p>
<p>"This is a critical step," he said. "They have shown you can detect this gene mutation (for prostate cancer). And if you extrapolate that you can do it for one gene, you could probably do it for 100 or 1,000."</p>
<p>Scientists are working hard to identify biomarkers for specific cancers and test those markers' usefulness in diagnosing cancer in patients. Some 1,000 biomarkers have been found, but Hudson said only nine of those have been validated so far in the clinic.</p>
<p>The other challenge is to find a way to test for many different biomarkers at once and develop a cost-effective technology to do it.</p>
<p>Hudson cautioned the device is still a long way off from being a staple in doctor's offices.</p>
<p>"How we make these (biomarker) tests happen in the clinic or in the clinical lab really needed some advances in technology. And Kelley and Sargent have done all the proof of principles here for a technology that's going to work."</p>
<p>For the initial work, Sargent and Kelley looked at prostate cancer, which has a set of signature biomarkers, shown in many studies to accurately portray the presence and severity of that disease.</p>
<p>The pair showed the chips were well able to pick up these makers in the minuscule concentrations typically found in the urine of prostate cancer patients.</p>
<p>But even now, Kelley said, they are shifting the technology's sights to other cancers and ailments.</p>
<p>"We've already done a little bit of work with head and neck cancer," Kelley said. "But really any cancer where there is an established molecular profile, we should be able to pick up using this device."</p>
<p>Sargent said he envisions the devices being a commonplace tool in doctors' offices around the world, along with a binder full of chips for different cancers and diseases.</p>
<p>"Say you were looking for H1N1 (influenza) or some dangerous infectious agent, there could be chips specific to those," he said. "You would just insert the proper one."</p>

<p>Apostrophe lurched out of the gutter, staggered and almost toppled over -- I couldn't tell if he was drunk or simply top-heavy, betrayed by a combination of giant head, curly little tail and gravity.</p>
<p>"Buy me a drink!" he demanded, with an exclamation point.</p>
<p>Ah, there was my answer: Plastered as the Sistine Chapel. Apostrophe had gone over the top, as usual.</p>
<p>"Don't you mean, 'Buy me a drink?' with a question mark?" I replied.</p>
<p>"No," Apostrophe said, "It's an imperative. Buy me one for National Punctuation Day."</p>
<p>I slapped my forehead, winced.</p>
<p>His shoulders slumped. "You forgot."</p>
<p>"Its not like its Christmas," I whined by way of apology.</p>
<p>"It's!" he snapped. "Not its, it's!"</p>
<p>I cringed. Mine was the sort of thoughtlessness that led to poor Apostrophe's downfall in the first place.</p>
<p>You might recall meeting him a few years ago. He was once a proud pillar of the language community, a little possessive perhaps, but beloved by poets who used words like e'er, o'er and 'tis. ("More contractions than a maternity ward," he sniffled.)</p>
<p>Then writers got sloppy, began dropping the apostrophe for no reason, or 'using' it for single quotation marks 'inappropriately.' Even signmakers couldn't get him right:</p>
<p>"It's Men's, not Mens," he shouted at the washroom door. It was the absence of an apostrophe at <span class="companylink">Tim Hortons</span> that finally sent him over the edge, drinking double-doubles.</p>
<p>It's not just the apostrophe. Commas, colons, long dashes -- few seem to understand the common symbols often referred to as the traffic signs of the English language. Text messaging on handheld devices has worsened the confusion; the BlackBerry treats punctuation marks as second-class citizens, consigning them to the keypad's cheap seats: out-of-the-way places accessible only by four-wheel drive and an awkward combination of buttons. The result is no punctuation at all: "cant make it c u l8r"</p>
<p>This is, one must acknowledge, the second sign of the end of civilization as we know it (the first was the sale of lime-flavoured beer). Start breaking the language laws and next thing you know it's full-scale anarchy, panic-stricken English teachers barricaded inside empty schools while illiterate Road Warrior savages rat-race down bombed-out streets with screaming librarians lashed to their fenders.</p>
<p>Which brings us to National Punctuation Day, which we dutifully observed Sept. 24. It's a newish holiday, founded in 2004 by American Jeff Rubin, who seems determined to root out the rot. "There's an epidemic of poor punctuation in the United States, much like the swine flu," he said. "It's too bad there's no vaccine to prevent it."</p>
<p>Casual shortcuts bred by</p>
<p>e-mailing and text messaging have no place in school papers or professional business writing, Rubin writes. "In the business world, words have power and help decision-makers form impressions immediately. Careless punctuation mistakes cost time, money, and productivity." His website -- nationalpunctuationday.com -- points to a 2006 Globe</p>
<p>and Mail story about a misplaced contract comma that exposed Rogers Communications to a $2.13-million utility-pole bill.</p>
<p>Rubin is described as a former newspaperman. I'm not sure those are the best credentials for a language campaigner; it's like saying your appendix is to be removed by a former first aid attendant. Journalists tend to use English the same way a monkey drives a Ferrari.</p>
<p>Personally, if I had understood the difference between "You never call me anymore" and "You, never call me anymore," I might have avoided a nasty restraining order.</p>
<p>But I get Rubin's point, and so do others.

<p>This fall, you're likely mulling over whether to get an H1N1 vaccination. But have you ever stopped to think about the shots you put your pet through?</p>
<p>Are annual vaccines for cats and dogs necessary? The answer depends on which veterinarian you ask.</p>
<p>For decades, standard practice was yearly booster shots for a host of diseases. But now, more and more Canadian vets are easing up on the needlefest in response to growing evidence that vaccinating annually for every disease is unnecessary, since the immunity provided by some vaccines lasts longer than a year, maybe even a lifetime.</p>
<p>“You don't want to be giving vaccines without consideration that there is a risk,” said Nigel Gumley, a veterinarian in Ottawa who has researched animal vaccination protocols and recommends against annual booster shots for every pet.</p>
<p>“The approach has gone from just blindly saying, ‘Well, this vaccine's on the market, let's give it,' to saying, ‘Let's look at the individual, let's weigh the risks and the benefits,' ” Dr. Gumley said.</p>
<p>While most animals do not experience side effects from vaccines, risks range from localized and temporary reactions such as swelling and itching to more rare and serious autoimmune disorders in dogs; cats are vulnerable to a specific type of cancerous tumour at the injection site.</p>
<p>“The [fact] that unnecessary vaccines can cause serious side effects is in direct conflict with sound medical practices,” said Ronald Schultz, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Veterinary Medicine, who has studied canine vaccines since the 1970s and was one of the first experts to suggest that pets are becoming overvaccinated.</p>
<p>Many vets have switched to a three-year schedule for booster shots.</p>
<p>Dr. Gumley estimates that about half of Canadian vets now recommend against routine annual vaccinations, compared with about 10 per cent a few years ago. The Canadian Veterinary Medical Association's official stance is that vaccine schedules should be tailored to the individual pet. If, for example, your dog is a social butterfly at the dog park and frequently visits “doggie camp” for boarding stays, then more frequent vaccinations for kennel cough may be in order. And an indoor cat may need fewer vaccines than an outdoor cat.</p>
<p>“You've got to look at your patients' lifestyles, and you've got to individualize it,” Dr. Gumley said.</p>
<p>Why hasn't every vet moved to relax the vaccine schedule? The main problem is lack of data, Dr. Gumley said.</p>
<p>With human diseases, we have sophisticated tracking systems so we know exactly where and when outbreaks of diseases such as measles or flu happen. But there's nothing like that for pet illness; veterinarians have to rely on word of mouth and anecdotal evidence to know whether they should be worried about outbreaks of distemper or parvovirus in their areas. In the absence of a disease-monitoring system, some vets choose to err on the side of caution and continue to push annual vaccinations.</p>
<p>Another option is annual titre blood tests that show the level of immunity the animal still has from its last vaccination. Using that information a doctor can decide whether a booster shot is necessary. Some vets, however, charge the same amount for the titre as for the vaccination, so you may have to shop around to make this a cost-effective solution.</p>
<p>The most important thing is to talk to your vet about what schedule is right for your pet.</p>
<p>“I think most vets are fairly open,” Dr. Gumley said. “Don't be afraid to ask the questions.”</p>

<div>PANDEMIC ETIQUETTE</div>
<div>Globe Life Column</div>
<div id="hd"><b>Don't worry, Dalai Lama. I'll still shake your hand</b>
</div><div>JUDITH TIMSON </div>

<p>jtimson@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>I have a killer cough.</p>
<p>Perhaps, in the interest of my social viability, I should rephrase: I have a substantial cough, the result of a seasonal allergy. When I go out, I worry that people may think I am, you know, sick. So I wonder, do I spend time explaining that my cough isn't contagious?</p>
<p>Given that we're in the great pandemic era, I think yes. I owe it to anyone who might needlessly worry to set their mind at ease. It's all part of good swine-flu manners. The airwaves and Internet are filled with H1N1 etiquette tips and stories these days.</p>
<p>Have you weaned yourself off handshaking yet? Mastered a “bump” as an alternative greeting? The ladies on The View were practising the elbow bump with much hilarity the other day. And the mayor of Memphis, Tenn., recently greeted the Dalai Lama with a fist bump instead of a handshake after someone in his office had come down with the H1N1 virus. Despite some criticism that the mayor's gesture was “disrespectful,” His Holiness seemed to enjoy it.</p>
<p>In the interest of staying healthy this fall, when the H1N1 virus is predicted to be at its most menacing, we are clearly having to rethink our social behaviour. But the advice is changing constantly.</p>
<p>First it was all about hand washing. Earlier this month, the federal and provincial governments rolled out radio and television ads promoting hand washing (for 20 seconds!) and reinforcing the message: “Stay home if you're sick.” The U.S. government even enlisted Elmo, the adorable furry red puppet from Sesame Street, to star in a video urging school kids to wash their hands. (Shouldn't it have been Miss Piggy?) But now we are hearing that, despite those watery ads and the ubiquitous hand sanitizers – even at the grocery store! – hand washing may not be enough, that most of the contagion will be airborne. Does that mean even the air kiss can be problematic?</p>
<p>Furthermore, I've had only partial luck with this sneezing-into-my-sleeve thing. The other day, while clothes shopping I did just that, and then, mortified, wondered whether the already snobby sales clerk would notice there was snot on my sweater.</p>
<p>It's reasonable to ask whether we are all succumbing to a germaphobia that will one day seem as quaint as those depictions of domestic bomb shelters in the early 1950s and school kids hiding under their desks.</p>
<p>But I think, on balance, the answer is no. None of this stay healthy campaign is harmful to our psyches. In fact, the emphasis on citizens protecting themselves from the H1N1 flu virus may give us a psychological boost as well. Many people have felt dwarfed by recent global catastrophes – the pandemic, the financial meltdown. So anything that gives individuals a sense that they can protect themselves or direct their own fates is a good thing. Psychological immunity is as important as the physical kind.</p>
<p>Anyway, these public health campaigns are merely reinforcing what we should already be doing.</p>
<p>As for tinkering with our social etiquette, I remember being taken aback during the SARS outbreak in Toronto six years ago when a doctor I met for the first time declined to shake my hand in his office. “I think we'll dispense with that,” he said, not unkindly. But none of us is surprised any more if someone politely eschews closer physical contact. We may, if anything, be too straightforward about wanting people to stay a germ's width away.</p>
<p>We just have to keep an eye on what is reasonable and prudent self protection and what is over the top.</p>
<p>The latter would include physically rearing back in horror from anyone in a social setting, calling out double-dippers with “Stop! You're endangering our lives!” as they reach with the same half-eaten tortilla chip for the guacamole or wearing a biohazard suit to your child's next school outing.</p>
<p>Prudent, if you have young kids, would be persistently monitoring the health of your children's friends when you decide on play dates, and planning ahead for the fact that this winter they will probably be staying home from school more than usual.</p>
<p>For now I will continue to shake hands with anyone who wants to shake hands with me (including the Dalai Lama). But if the pandemic ramps up, I'm on the lookout for an alternative social greeting that is warm and works.</p>
<p>Personally, I think it's ridiculous and weirdly hostile to use your elbow to greet anyone. How about clasping one or both hands to your heart and smiling, as if to say, “I'm so happy to see you!” That might not only keep me healthy, but make me the most endearing person in the room. Until I start coughing.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Urine test may replace biopsies for cancer</b>

<p>A new cancer-detecting device the size of a BlackBerry and designed by a team of University of Toronto researchers could revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of a wide range of cancers and other ailments.</p>
<p>Designed with microchip technology, the new device is aimed at eliminating the need for painful biopsies by detecting the presence and severity of cancer via a urine sample. It could also eliminate the equally painful wait times patients undergoing cancer diagnoses routinely endure: test results computed by the device can be completed in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>“Today, it takes a room filled with computers to evaluate a clinically relevant sample of cancer biomarkers, and the results aren't quickly available,” says Shana Kelley, the U of T professor who was a lead investigator on the project and co-authored a paper on the work published today in the journal Nature Nanotechnology.</p>
<p>“Our team was able to measure biomolecules on an electronic chip the size of your fingertip and analyze the sample within half an hour.”</p>
<p>Although still in the engineering phase (doctors won't have the option of acquiring the devices for another two or three years) the device has been tested on prostate cancer and head and neck cancer models. It could potentially be used to diagnose and assess other cancers, as well as infectious diseases such as HIV, MRSA and H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Fei-Fei Liu, a radiation oncologist at Princess Margaret Hospital and head of the applied molecular oncology division at the Ontario Cancer Institute, called the system “a revolutionary technology.”</p>
<p>“This type of approach could have a profound impact on the future management for our cancer patients,” she said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>The next new trend is...trumped-up trends; Plenty of people are polite, courteous--and wear pants</b>
</div><div>Meghan Daum   </div>
<div>Special To The Los Angeles Times</div>
<div>832 words</div><div>28 September 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A18</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>As we should all know by now, three examples equals a trend. This summer, we saw the official declaration of the "no pants" trend, thanks to the sartorial exhibitionism of precisely three women: Victoria Beckham, Beyonce and Lady Gaga. Now that that's over, the trifecta du jour is rudeness. Everyone's doing it.</p>
<p>You don't need me to go over the details again. Suffice to say: Serena Williams at the U.S. Open, South Carolina Rep. Joe Wilson during U.S. President Barack Obama's health-care speech and rapper Kanye West at the MTV Video Music Awards.</p>
<p>Because these events happened in quick succession--and because all three offending parties extended their rudeness with insufficient apologies--the "trend" is almost a foregone conclusion: The whole world has gone irrevocably rude.</p>
<p>Forget swine flu, terror plots or the public option. America's greatest vexation, according to headlines and radio and TV talk-show hosts, is bad manners. A Rasmussen poll found 75 per cent of a survey group of 1,000 believed that Americans were "becoming more rude and less civilized." Etiquette experts and sociologists have been called in to comment on the epidemic.</p>
<p>The culprits? A lack of emotional nuance engendered by blogging and texting, not to mention the generally churlish tone of the Internet.</p>
<p>Mass culture that rewards obstreperousness and instant reactions while making little time for measured thought. Not yet cited as causes but no doubt still under consideration: the bad economy, mercury poisoning and cold, distant mothers.</p>
<p>As helpful as it is to be warned of such scourges, is "the new rudeness" new, and is it here to stay? Or, like the post-9/11 trends "the new nice" and "the new normal"--and even a bit like "no pants"--is it just another phantasm?</p>
<p>Sure, boorishness abounds, but at no time in history has it exactly been in short supply. It may be human nature to assume that bygone eras were more civilized than the barbaric present--oh, those virtuous Victorians; oh, the repressed-but-gracious Eisenhower-era citizenry --but let's not forget that, for example, the Victorians may have been too demure to tolerate the sight of a lady's ankles but they didn't blink an eye at children working like slaves in factories or debtors sentenced to squalid prisons. That might not technically qualify as rudeness, but it could be called barbarism. And it's a lot worse than anything even an uninhibited celebrity can do.</p>
<p>Still, it's instructive to follow the fortunes of "the rudeness epidemic"-- if only as a tutorial on how to turn happenstance into a national bellwether (a recent rigorous effort in this genre came from a New York Times writer who observed slight paunches on a few fashionable men and declared beer bellies the hip new accessory)and a testament to something most people can't seem to get enough of: public scoldings.</p>
<p>Is there anything more engaging than being told about the moral decay of society, especially when you can easily point to ways in which you are the exception to the shenanigans?</p>
<p>Other people are wretched, but we ourselves are exemplary because, for instance, we refrain from stepping out of our cars in short skirts and no underwear.</p>
<p>But it's one thing to join in the fun of a public excoriation and another to decide that a menacing cultural virus has unleashed itself on the nation. After all, there are ways of discerning what is a trend and what is not.</p>
<p>You can gather actual evidence, track more than one set of numbers and ask probing questions of a lot of people over time, rather than monitoring celebrity outbursts and getting a quick reaction. But because it's easier for bloggers, producers and writers (I know of what I speak) to start and finish with what friends say at dinner parties, we are left with a version of reality based more on "something in the air" than solid facts.</p>
<p>Does "the new rudeness" fall into this category? My dinner companions say yes. Amid the rude and uncivilized, they point out, are plenty of people who are polite and courteous. At any given time all over the world, folks are helping their neighbours, showing kindness to strangers and refraining from throwing their shoes at world leaders. So why isn't that a trend?</p>
<p>Maybe because, as the president suggested when he made the rounds of the Sunday talk shows, reasonable discourse doesn't catch as many eyeballs on the news crawl as unbridled fits of rage. Or maybe because decency doesn't come inthrees-- in fact, it's a lot more common than that.</p>
<p>Then again, it could be that I'm dining with the wrong crowd.</p>

<p>Agriculture minister's cousin found dead in basement</p>
<p>One teenage boy is dead and another is in hospital after being discovered unconscious Friday in a home in Melville, Sask., east of Regina. RCMP officials say when their officers arrived at the home, Liam Bjornerud, 14, was found dead in a basement bedroom. A Saskatchewan government official said the boy was the cousin of Saskatchewan Agriculture Minister Bob Bjornerud. A 13-year-old boy was found unconscious and taken to hospital in Regina for treatment. RCMP say there was no obvious sign of trauma and they will likely have to wait for toxicology results to determine the cause of death. An autopsy is to be performed Monday.</p>

<p>RCMP say a Mountie has shot dead an armed man in Hazelton, B.C., during an attempt to arrest him on five outstanding warrants. Corporal Dan Moskaluk says the unidentified man was located in a remote area by members of the Police Dog Service and the Emergency Response Team from the RCMP's North District office, based in Prince George. He says police had planned the arrest after receiving information from the public that the wanted man was armed with a rifle. He couldn't say what led to the shooting. The Delta Police Department will be investigating the incident, along with the Commission for Public Complaints against the RCMP.</p>

<p>Friends, relatives and admirers gathered in Halifax today to celebrate the life and accomplishments of Muriel Duckworth. The longtime social activist was remembered during an emotional memorial service at Mount Saint Vincent University as a tireless worker for social justice and change. Duckworth died last month at the age of 100. Former federal NDP leader Alexa McDonough called Duckworth "an extraordinary Canadian woman" who spent her life fighting discrimination, poverty and war, while pursuing a myriad of other causes. Duckworth's life was remembered in song and in stories told by a number of speakers.</p>

<p>Rain and a strong police presence dampen party spirit</p>
<p>The weekend bender in Kingston, Ont. fizzled out early Sunday morning as a little rain and a lot of police prevented thousands of university students from moving their party to the streets. Queen's University cancelled this year's fall homecoming after last year's parties got out of hand, but thousands of students still came to play. Between Friday night and early Sunday morning, Kingston Police Const. Michael Menor estimated that more than 80 arrests were made - mostly on drunk and disorderly or underage drinking charges. Menor said a number of intoxicated people were also taken to hospital, but there were no reports of serious injuries or property damage.</p>

<p>Thou shalt not shake hands in a Winnipeg Roman Catholic church, starting this weekend. The announcement from the Archdiocese of Winnipeg means the church is now at Stage 1 of its three-stage pandemic preparation plan.

<p>Exercise your willpower Mac researcher says</p>
<p>If you can't muster the energy for a workout, there may be a better reason than you thought.</p>
<p>Researchers at McMaster University have found that if you've already used up your willpower for one task -- say, dealing with a challenging work matter -- you won't have enough willpower left for another task, like exercising.</p>
<p>Their study, published in Psychology and Health, found that if you challenge your brain too much, you might not have the energy left to challenge your body.</p>
<p>"Cognitive tasks, as well as emotional tasks such as regulating your emotions, can deplete your self-regulatory capacity to exercise," said Kathleen Martin Ginis, associate professor of kinesiology at Mac and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>She said you can help boost your willpower by exercising it. Forcing yourself to workout or study can help build your willpower capacity.</p>
<p>Swine flu contagious until coughing stops</p>

<p>TROUBLE ON THE FARM</p>
<p>Why pig farmers are on the run</p>
<p>If you ask Canadian pig farmers, the recession is far from over.</p>
<p>Hit by rising feed costs and a higher Canadian dollar, pork producers have been hammered by two more devastating developments.</p>
<p>First came mandatory country-of-origin rules in the U.S., which have been criticized for prejudicing American buyers against Canadian pork.</p>
<p>Then came H1N1, whose introduction to the world as “swine flu” scared away buyers.</p>
<p>Caught in this toxic storm, most pork producers have given up. In Alberta alone, the total number of pig farmers has fallen to 450 from 1,500 in four years – a 70-per-cent decrease. That's after the industry's Canada-wide ranks contracted by 82 per cent between 1976 and 2006.</p>
<p>Consolidation has, of course, played a major role but so have the economics of the industry. Last year, Canadian pig farmers lost $1-billion.</p>
<p>And with few hopes of a quick recovery, the country could lose 25 per cent of its hog count this year, according to Glen Price, the president of Sunterra Quality Food Markets. The grocer dropped prices on some pork products by 60 per cent at some Alberta stores this weekend, in hopes of stirring more demand for the product.</p>
<p>But Ottawa has already begun the process of waving the white flag on pork. Industry and the federal government are scrambling to assemble a Hog Farm Transition Program. Two of its key goals: “enable producers to exit the sector” and “contribute to permanently reducing Canada's hog production capacity.”</p>

<p>ECONOMIC SLACK: A DAYBOOK SERIES</p>
<p>A global recession has punctured economic activity around the world and its toll is showing up everywhere from underused factories and empty offices to jobless people and idled trains. The result, in a word, is slack.</p>
<p>Canada hasn't been immune. Slack – excess supply, or the untapped part of an economy's components – shows just how much potential is being lost in this downturn, and how much further we have to go to recover. It also highlights inflation trends – as slack gets taken up, prices and wages tend to creep higher.</p>
<p>Today, ROB's Daybook begins a series looking at economic slack.</p>
<p>People</p>
<p>The job losses</p>
<p>The recession has eliminated 387,000 jobs in Canada since last October, with the unemployment rate hitting an 11-year high of 8.7 per cent. More than 1.6 million Canadians are now out of work. The steepest job losses have been among factory workers, but no sector has been spared.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Flu control; A solution is in your hands</b>
</div><div>The Windsor Star</div>
<div>413 words</div><div>28 September 2009</div><div>Windsor Star</div><div>WINSTR</div><div>Final</div><div>A6</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Windsor Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The local health unit is gearing up for a busy flu season. Part of its strategy is an extended vaccination program to deal with both the H1N1 flu virus and the seasonal flu.</p>
<p>But on a recent trip to Windsor, Dr. David Williams, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, also had some good advice to help stop the spread of the virus -- frequent handwashing.</p>
<p>The fact remains that despite all the advances in medicine in recent years, just about the best way to avoid illness and disease is soap and water.</p>
<p>(According to the Public Health Agency of Canada, people have no natural immunity to protect against the H1N1 virus, which develops into a respiratory illness that affects the nose, throat and lungs.)</p>
<p>Studies have shown that hands are one of the leading sources of spreading infection.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta puts it this way: "It is well-documented that one of the most important measures for preventing the spread of pathogens is effective handwashing."</p>
<p>Yet a 2009 Global Hygiene survey found that 60 per cent of us don't know that washing hands can prevent flu and 70 per cent of us don't wash our hands after touching ordinary objects.</p>
<p>Just as surprising is research showing that many nurses and doctors in hospital settings are not making handwashing a top priority. Recent statistics covering April 2008 to March 2009 show the compliance rate for handwashing at Ontario hospitals was 53 per cent before patient contact and 69 per cent after. That's worrisome.</p>
<p>Maher El-Masri, research leadership chair in the U of W's faculty of nursing, recently studied handwashing compliance at a Florida hospital and found the compliance rate was 34.3 per cent. The excuse given was that medical staff were simply too busy to wash their hands properly before dealing with patients.</p>
<p>"It was a bit surprising, given all the attention given to the importance of handwashing. Nurses and doctors are supposed to have 100 per cent compliance," says El-Masri.</p>
<p>But it's not just health care workers who can do more. All of us -- whether we work in an office building or a restaurant -- can get into the habit of frequent handwashing to protects ourselves as well as those we come in contact with.</p>
<p>The cold and flu season is coming -- wash up, stay healthy.</p>

</p>
<p>A global recession has punctured economic activity around the world and its toll is showing up everywhere from underused factories and empty offices to jobless people and idled trains. The result, in a word, is slack.</p>
<p>Canada hasn't been immune. Slack – excess supply, or the untapped part of an economy's components – shows just how much potential is being lost in this downturn, and how much further we have to go to recover. It also highlights inflation trends – as slack gets taken up, prices and wages tend to creep higher.</p>
<p>Today, ROB's Daybook begins a series looking at economic slack.</p>
<p>PEOPLE</p>
<p>The Job losses The recession has eliminated 387,000 jobs in Canada since last October, with the unemployment rate hitting an 11-year high of 8.7 per cent. More than 1.6 million Canadians are now out of work. The steepest job losses have been among factory workers, but no sector has been spared.</p>
<p>People are remaining unemployed for longer than in the previous two recessions, according to TD Economics.</p>
<p>The workday Those who have jobs are working less as factories move to four-day weeks and offices cut hours. Canadians over the age of 25 worked an average of 37.8 hours a week in August compared with 38.4 hours two years ago, Statistics Canada says.</p>
<p>Nowhere is lost hours as prevalent as among students. The average number of hours worked by students this summer plunged to just 23.4 hours a week – the lowest level on record.</p>
<p>The underemployed</p>
<p>Fewer hours worked and growth in part-time positions suggest more Canadians are toiling at jobs that aren't full-time even though they'd prefer a full-time position. Statscan's R8 measure, which includes those who are discouraged and working involuntarily part-time, reached 10.3 per cent last month. In the same month last year, it stood at 7.6 per cent.</p>

<p>Why pig farmers are on the run</p>
<p>If you ask Canadian pig farmers, the recession is far from over.</p>
<p>Hit by rising feed costs and a higher Canadian dollar, pork producers have been hammered by two more devastating developments.</p>
<p>First came mandatory country-of-origin rules in the U.S., which have been criticized for prejudicing American buyers against Canadian pork.</p>
<p>Then came H1N1, whose introduction to the world as “swine flu” scared away buyers.</p>
<p>Caught in this toxic storm, most pork producers have given up. In Alberta alone, the total number of pig farmers has fallen to 450 from 1,500 in four years – a 70-per-cent decrease. That's after the industry's Canada-wide ranks contracted by 82 per cent between 1976 and 2006.</p>
<p>Consolidation has, of course, played a major role but so have the economics of the industry. Last year, Canadian pig farmers lost $1-billion.</p>
<p>And with few hopes of a quick recovery, the country could lose 25 per cent of its hog count this year, according to Glen Price, the president of Sunterra Quality Food Markets. The grocer dropped prices on some pork products by 60 per cent at some Alberta stores this weekend, in hopes of stirring more demand for the product.</p>
<p>But Ottawa has already begun the process of waving the white flag on pork. Industry and the federal government are scrambling to assemble a Hog Farm Transition Program. Two of its key goals: “enable producers to exit the sector” and “contribute to permanently reducing Canada's hog production capacity.” Nathan Vanderklippe</p>
<p>THE EXPLAINER</p>
<p>Q. How does a “feed-in tariff work, so that companies that produce clean electricity can earn more money than those that generate electricity from coal or nuclear?</p>
<p>A. A feed-in tariff, sometimes called a “standard offer,” is a fixed price that a utility pays producers for renewable electricity.</p>
<p>Essentially, a utility pays higher rates for electricity produced by wind turbines, solar panels, biomass or other “green” projects, as an incentive to develop these sources. It pays less for power from nuclear or coal plants.</p>
<p>Often the price is considerably above the market rate for electricity from conventional sources, essentially subsidizing the power projects.</p>
<p>Q. Where have tariffs been put in place?</p>
<p>A. Many European countries, and others around the world, have them.</p>
<p>In Canada, Ontario was the first to set up a feed-in tariff policy. In 2006, the province created a standard offer program that paid special rates to small producers of wind and solar power. British Columbia started a small standard offer plan this year.</p>
<p>Ontario is now finalizing a much more comprehensive feed-in tariff structure for a range of renewables, and not just from small producers.</p>
<p>The highest proposed price, under the Ontario plan, is for rooftop solar power systems of less than 10 kilowatts, which will earn 80.2 cents a kilowatt-hour, about 14 times the current rate consumers pay for electricity.</p>

</div><div>By Kevin Rollason   </div>

</p>
<p>Thou shalt not shake hands in a Roman Catholic church for a sign of peace, starting this weekend.</p>
<p>The order didn't come from the province's chief doctor, but from the Archdiocese of Winnipeg.</p>
<p>In an announcement on its website Friday afternoon, the archdiocese ratcheted up to stage 1 of its three-stage H1N1 flu pandemic preparation plans. In those plans, stage 1 means a virus is in the general population and people with chronic and acute illnesses are at risk.</p>
<p>The memorandum from Archbishop James Weisgerber says the plans "were developed as a necessary precaution in response to current concerns about an increased risk of infection from the H1N1 virus. All are reminded that before moving to stages 2 or 3, a directive will be issued from my office."</p>
<p>It means that when Roman Catholics go to church this weekend, they will notice the holy water fonts at the entrances have been drained of water, that there are hand-sanitizing stations there, that the worship space will be disinfected with a spray after the service and that during communion, the chalice will be "aggressively wiped after each communicant. Afterward, it should be turned a quarter away".</p>
<p>As well, during the Rite of Peace, instead of shaking hands, they will be told to substitute a "bow of the head."</p>
<p>"These changes are not permanent," archdiocese spokesman James Buchok said. "They're just during times of risk. We wanted to put them in place at the beginning of cold and flu season. It's not as if we will never shake hands again for the passing of the peace."</p>
<p>If needed, the archdiocese's stage 2 plans, for when the virus begins to kill people in the high-risk population, include discontinuing drinking from the chalice and placing the wafer on the tongue during communion. Stage 3, when the virus is pervasive and everybody is at risk, would see parish assemblies limited or, in what the archdiocese says would be a "worst-case scenario," churches closing because the civil authorities have banned public assemblies.</p>
<p>Father Sam Argenziano, of Holy Rosary Church in Osborne Village, said he will implement the changes he hasn't already put in place this weekend.</p>
<p>"I had the hand-sanitizing stations up a couple of months ago," Argenziano said. "With the holy water fonts, I think it is something people are used to, but once you explain stagnant water holds germs, they'll realize it is here until it passes."</p>
<p>Argenziano said the Rite of Peace doesn't have to involve shaking hands.</p>
<p>"It's a sign of peace -- they'll still get the message," he said.</p>
<p>"I'm hoping we get just a light stage 1 and not higher, but you have to be careful. I always wash my hands."</p>
<p>Dr. Joel Kettner, the province's chief medical officer of health, said the measures taken by the church don't come from him, but he said he is encouraging hadwashing and coughing or sneezing into your arm.</p>
<p>"This is their own independent decision-making," Kettner said.</p>
<p>"I haven't given out any advice to change your usual practices. The decisions around personal contact are a matter of weighing benefits and risks.</p>
<p>"We are leaving it up to individuals and groups."</p>
<p>Kettner said it's not handshaking that spreads the H1N1 virus, but what you do afterwards.</p>
<p>"We're not recommending handshaking should be avoided or kissing should be avoided," he said.</p>
<p>"To get sick, you have to shake hands with someone with the virus and then bring your hand up to your nose, eye or mouth in the short time before the virus dies. The bottom line is at this point of time it should be business as usual."</p>
<p>Rev. Marc Whitehead, of North Kildonan United Church, said his congregation has discussed extensive plans for what to do before and when H1N1 hits the community.</p>
<p>Whitehead said they are encouraging handwashing and the use of hand sanitizers.</p>
<p>He said the first test of their planning will be on Oct. 4, worldwide communion Sunday.</p>
<p>"People will come forward for communion, but (the bread) will be handed to them by a server, probably using tongs," Whitehead said.</p>

<p>People doubting</p>
<p>vaccine's safety</p>
<p>MONTREAL -- Jennifer Madar is in the third trimester of her pregnancy, meaning she's on the priority list of people who should get the H1N1 vaccine this fall, according to public health authorities.</p>
<p>But the 35-year-old Montreal woman isn't so sure about rolling up her sleeve for a flu shot.</p>
<p>"It's a new vaccine and I'm kind of reluctant, because you never know about possible side- effects," she said.</p>
<p>Madar isn't alone in her misgivings about the H1N1 vaccine. A U.S. public opinion survey released last week found that only 40 per cent of parents said they will get their children vaccinated against the H1N1 virus, while 54 per cent indicated they would give their kids the regular seasonal flu shot.</p>
<p>To vaccinate or not to vaccinate? It's rapidly becoming the question of 2009.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the public skepticism about the upcoming H1N1 vaccination campaign, Canada's obstetricians and gynecologists are mounting an information blitz aimed at pregnant women. Posters and fact sheets are being sent to hospitals, clinics and doctor's offices. Physicians are being told to provide advance prescriptions to pregnant women for the antiviral drug Tamiflu that could be filled at the first sign of H1N1 symptoms.</p>
<p>All of this is predicated on the fact that H1N1 is a relatively new strain and has killed a disproportionately higher number of young people than the seasonal flu. What's more, the World Health Organization has declared an H1N1 pandemic and has warned that a second, perhaps deadlier, wave of infections is imminent this fall.</p>
<p>Those who have confirmed cases of H1N1 should not get the vaccine. That's because their immune systems could overreact horribly. said Karl Weiss, a microbiologist at Montreal's Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital.</p>

<p>Thumbs up</p>
<p>To Randy Young and Henry Watts and anyone else who is recording the stories of Canada's war veterans. The ranks of our Second World War veterans are thinning every year -- and it is important that their memories are being preserved.</p>
<p>Thumbs down</p>
<p>To the federal government, for spending more to promote the Conservative economic action plan than on plans to fight the H1N1 flu. Public health information is important to all of us as we enter what promises to be a doozy of a flu season.</p>
<p>Thumbs up</p>
<p>To Victoria violinist Nikki Chooi, who has won the use of a 1729 Guarneri del Gesù violin, valued at $4.3 million, for the next three years. Chooi was one of 14 winners of a Canada Council for the Arts competition that offered gifted classical-string players a chance to borrow instruments valued at more than $28 million -- and dating back as far as 1696.</p>
<p>Thumbs down</p>
<p>To the drivers who continue to use their cellphones while behind the wheel. A three-vehicle crash on the Trans-Canada Highway has been linked to cellphone use -- and it is just the latest in a long list. When will drivers get their priorities straight?</p>

<p>Although the H1N1 pandemic has proven to be a mild one so far, it would be a mistake to downplay the threat it poses, says one of Canada's top public health experts.</p>
<p>Kumanan Wilson, Canada Research Chair in public health policy at the University of Ottawa, said Canada must not repeat the mistakes that were made during past public health emergencies, such as the SARS outbreak and the tainted blood scandal, and that the fundamental ethos of public health -- the precautionary principle -- must be applied.</p>
<p>"We have to assume the worst-case scenario in public health because the worst-case scenarios in public health, they don't affect a few people, they affect large populations with potentially catastrophic results," he said in an interview with Canwest News Service and Global National. "One of the mistakes we made with the blood system and the tainted blood scandal was downplaying the risk, waiting for better evidence, not overreacting . . . and the results were somewhat catastrophic," he said.</p>
<p>In the 1970s and 1980s, the national blood supply was contaminated and tens of thousands of Canadians were infected with hepatitis C and some with HIV.</p>
<p>The emergence of the new strain of the H1N1 virus in the spring, and its quick migration around the globe that prompted the World Health Organization to declare it a pandemic, has been driving fear and panic that this is the deadly flu experts have been predicting for years. Governments around the world are mounting massive responses and are spending billions of dollars to fight the virus, also called the swine flu.</p>
<p>Individual cases of swine flu are not being tracked so it's impossible to know how many Canadians have caught the bug, but more than 1,400 people have been hospitalized and of those, almost 300 were admitted to an intensive-care unit.</p>
<p>The virus has been linked to 76 deaths, including that of a female resident of the Beecher Bay reserve.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Wage mandate angers SGEU head Bymoen</b>

</p>
<p>The relationship between the Saskatchewan Party government and one of the province's largest public-sector unions appears rocky as they deal with each other on a number of fronts.</p>
<p>The Saskatchewan Government and General Employees' Union (SGEU) was one of three unions that received a contract offer this week from the Saskatchewan Association of Health Organizations (SAHO). The offer has been dubbed an "insult."</p>
<p>The contract for more than 10,000 employees of executive government represented by the SGEU is due to expire Wednesday amid an acrimonious atmosphere.</p>
<p>"There's not a lot of trust," SGEU president Bob Bymoen said in an interview Friday.</p>
<p>The offer from the government-funded SAHO to SGEU, the Service Employees International Union West and the Canadian Union of Public Employees amounted to just under 10 per cent over four years, with extra money for licensed practical nurses and some specialists. Sask. Party Finance Minister Rod Gantefoer said this week the amount was an initial offer based on an undisclosed wage mandate set by the government.</p>
<p>Bymoen said it was "disrespectful" for the mandate and offer to be brought forward nearly 18 months after the health unions' contract had expired. During that period, the government introduced essential services legislation that takes away the health unions' bargaining powers, he noted.</p>
<p>The numbers involved are also a far cry from the 37 per cent wage increase over four years in the settlement with the Saskatchewan Union of Nurses and inadequate compared to general wage increases of Saskatchewan residents, he said.</p>
<p>At the same time, the workers seeking a new contract are being counted on amid fears of an H1N1 flu pandemic, said Bymoen.</p>
<p>The wage mandate and the essential services law, which bars specific employees from going on strike in a labour dispute, are also issues as the contract for executive government employees comes open. Falling under that contract are social workers, jail guards, snowplow drivers and many others.</p>
<p>The last open contract saw an SGEU strike against the then-NDP government, but the settlement also included an agreement to negotiate essential services. The introduction of legislation instead has damaged the government's relationship with the SGEU, said Bymoen, and is key to an unfair labour practice claim the union has filed against the government.</p>
<p>"It's an interesting time because the government has set the mandate and it controls the rulebook," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Liberals call for oversight body to stop partisan federal ads</b>
</div><div>Bruce Cheadle </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>604 words</div><div>26 September 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>B12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record. </div>
</p>
<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>An independent watchdog is needed to stop the Conservatives' "flagrant misuse of taxpayers' money" on partisan government advertising, Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said Friday.</p>
<p>The Liberals are proposing a system similar to one adopted in Ontario in 2004, which screens provincial government ads for partisanship and bans the use of any politician's name, image or voice.</p>
<p>"I'm willing, in the interest of democratic renewal here, to create an independent advisory committee which will, if we're in government, say, ‘Here are the lines, brother, you can't cross them,' " Ignatieff said at a news conference on Parliament Hill.</p>
<p>The committee would "make absolutely sure that the government of Canada advertises for the government of Canada - not for the party in power."</p>
<p>The Liberal proposal comes in reaction to news that the Conservative government is spending more than four times more on promoting its January budget than it is on public service messages for H1N1 flu.</p>
<p>Critics have complained that the $34-million Economic Action Plan campaign - and in particular an accompanying government website - are infused with partisan Conservative messaging.</p>
<p>The Liberal proposal received an immediate endorsement from New Democrat MP Pat Martin, who also wants the auditor general to examine current government communications practices.</p>
<p>"I think public outrage is going to cause this to happen sooner rather than later," Martin told The Canadian Press.</p>
<p>But the office of Prime Minister Stephen Harper had a rather cooler reaction.</p>
<p>The Liberal plan, said PMO spokesperson Andrew MacDougall, is "premised on the fact that there's something wrong with what we're doing" - a premise the government emphatically rejects.</p>
<p>"I think the (current) process works," added MacDougall.</p>
<p>"There are guidelines in place. We've certainly respected all of them."</p>
<p>The prime minister's spokesperson could not immediately explain how including dozens of pictures of Harper on the action plan website assists Canadians in understanding where their tax dollars are being spent.</p>
<p>"Pictures help show Canadians their government and their prime minister are hard at work on the economy," MacDougall responded in a followup email.</p>
<p>Partisanship in taxpayer-funded ads is a recurring issue in federal politics, and one that previous versions of the Conservative party railed against when in opposition.</p>
<p>The NDP's Martin said both Liberal and Conservative governments have been "guilty as hell of abusing what should be a black-and-white ethical issue."</p>
<p>Martin would also like to see MP mailing privileges - including those ubiquitous, government-paid leaflets that have been clogging Canadian mailboxes - put under the control of any new advertising review panel.</p>
<p>Opposition MPs have been complaining for more than a year that mass mailouts by Conservative MPs have pushed the rules on the leaflets to the breaking point. Some Liberal MPs have begun mailing out their own deeply partisan attacks this way.</p>
<p>It's all part of the "hyper partisanship" that has engulfed Parliament, said Ignatieff.</p>
<p>He linked the government ad campaign to Liberal party allegations that the Conservatives are disproportionately funnelling stimulus dollars to Tory-held ridings - a claim publicly bolstered this week by a Conservative candidate in Markham.</p>
<p>"It's the same pattern of hyper-partisanship that is making it impossible to work with this government," said Ignatieff. He also alluded to a Toronto Star report Friday detailing the feverish Conservative communications planning for last spring's pork barbecue on Parliament Hill in support of pig producers.</p>
<p>"C'mon guys. We've got pork producers struggling for their lives," said the Liberal leader.</p>
<p>"This is not a partisan political matter."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Doctors want phone fee</b>
</div><div>Doug Ward </div>

</p>
<p>The B.C. Medical Association wants its member physicians to be paid a fee by the provincial government for phone consultations involving potential H1N1 influenza cases.</p>
<p>BCMA president Dr. Brian Brodie says it would be financially and medically smarter to keep possible H1N1 patients at home rather than having them come to clogged physician offices, where other patients could be infected with the virus.</p>
<p>The phone consultation fee, recently proposed by the BCMA in discussions with the Ministry of Health, is $14.74, half the current office-visit fee.</p>
<p>Besides being cheaper than office visits, said Brodie, phone consultations would help physicians diagnose and prescribe treatment within the critical 48-hour period after the appearance of symptoms.</p>
<p>The BCMA president said Thursday: "This is really about good economy and timeliness."</p>
<p>At present, physicians are not paid for phone consultations. The fee would provide a "little bit of a financial incentive" for busy physicians to speak with patients who fear they have swine flu symptoms, said Brodie.</p>
<p>The BCMA is also seeking a second adjustment to the physician-fee structure so doctors are not penalized financially during a H1N1 influenza outbreak.</p>
<p>Now, physicians are paid $29.48 for every office visit. That rate is cut in half once a physician has seen 50 patients in a day.</p>
<p>The BCMA is proposing H1N1 patients not be included in that 50-patient cap because physicians' offices could be full of influenza patients in the event of a flu outbreak, driving the daily patient total well beyond 50.</p>
<p>Brodie said it would be unfair to ask physicians to increase their patient load during a flu outbreak but continue to apply a cap designed to restrict patient numbers.</p>
<p>The ministries of Health Services and Healthy Living and Sport, in a media statement, confirmed they have been meeting with the BCMA to discuss possible changes of the fee structure during an H1N1 outbreak.</p>
<p>"We know doctors may be unable to perform many of their usual duties in a severe pandemic.</p>
<p>"We will make sure doctors in British Columbia will be fairly paid for their services connected to the H1N1 influenza virus."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Radio's rude awakening; Annoying morning offerings range from the perky-plain to downright porny</b>

</p>
<p>They say that people get the politicians they deserve. Lately, I've been wondering if it's the same with morning radio.</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, I returned to Toronto after more than a decade away in New York. Down there, I'd all but stopped listening to the radio, turned off at first by the relentless ads and numbing repetition of the musical choices, and then, as my young children got a little older, by a growing concern that a DJ would say something I'd have trouble explaining to the kids.</p>
<p>But when I moved home, someone told me that radio audiences were growing. Perhaps I was missing out on something? A tasting menu was in order: If any one station proved irresistible, I resolved to return to the radio fold.</p>
<p>The experiment began inauspiciously. One morning last month, I woke up, flipped on CHFI-FM, and almost fell right back to sleep. Its formula was decades old: genial co-hosts, inoffensive jokes, and a generous helping of semi-classic pop from a decades-old playlist. The most recent ratings showed the station in solid possession of the No. 2 spot. I was flummoxed. What did it mean about Toronto that my fellow citizens had so passionately embraced the unremarkable charms of Erin Davis and Mike Cooper?</p>
<p>True, CBC Radio One didn't jump-start the heart, either. But Andy Barrie and his co-workers are the only ones on the dial these days interested in providing listeners with useful information. Politicians and advocates view the studio as a vital stop. On the first day of school, Mr. Barrie talked to a home-schooling advocate, the principal of Toronto's first Afrocentric School, and Ontario's Minister of Education. I'll admit, I sometimes braced myself, fearing a force-feeding of fibre for the spirit. But I'd push through and invariably ended up feeling enlightened, or at least more connected to the community.</p>
<p>Enlightenment isn't the goal over at Virgin Radio. The dominant tone of The Breakfast Show is a blend of snark and caffeine, with a claustrophobic overlay that comes from the hosts, Mad Dog and Billie, leaning too close to the microphone as they talk over each other. Still, there's life in the broadcast, even if Mad Dog is too often trying to make sexual jokes that are far too obvious to be funny. (When Dr. Oz told him during an interview that H1N1 was “a very promiscuous virus,” Mad Dog quipped, “I knew it was slutty.”)</p>
<p>At least their humour had a whiff of nuance. When Gayle King, a close friend of Oprah Winfrey whose sexuality is sometimes questioned by gossipers, visited TIFF, John Derringer on Q107 joked that she had “spent the weekend buried in the red carpet.” But if he's an unreconstructed man, more often than not he's being schooled by his sidekick Maureen Holloway. The other day, Mr. Derringer expressed sympathy for all the men whose desire to watch a particular football game had been stymied by their wives or girlfriends. “We should have a common area in a neighbourhood where a guy can go to watch TV,” he said. “We do,” snapped Ms. Holloway. “It's called a bar.”</p>
<p>The secret is to go all the way, to ignore societal restraints. Which is what brought me to the Dean Blundell Show, the No. 1 morning drive-time broadcast with men aged 18-49.</p>
<p>I'd heard of Mr. Blundell, but I'd never listened to him until last month, when I tuned to 102.1 and was confronted with a rambling segment featuring Qi Min Sheng, the show's “Asian correspondent,” mispronouncing words – “misery” for “Missouri,” “Canadia” for “Canada” – while protesting that he spoke, “perfect Eng-wish.” Suddenly, Dean and his sidekicks launched into a mincing imitation of gay men, apropos of nothing.</p>
<p>But then, that's the morning crew's special genius. They have the attention span of fleas: They'll begin a news report and then a belch from one will send them careening off into a reverie that ranges from salmon to – well, to sex, because that's where most of their reveries end up. A discussion with their resident sex expert about intercourse among fat people quickly deteriorated into jokes about using Tenderflake as lubricant and pepperonis for tassels. It's reprehensible, sure, but at some point it exercises a kind of hypnotic effect, and you willingly switch off your brain. I found myself admiring their almost surreal sensibility, and wondering if Salvador Dali might have been a fan.</p>
<p>Then, a couple of weeks ago, Dean and the boys reported on a double drowning accident at Florida's Lake Okeechobee. Explaining that William Reed, 67, and his 38-year-old son John were pulled from the water during a fishing tournament, the DJs giggled that the two men represented “the biggest catch of the derby.”</p>
<p>Something in my brain clicked. Two men had died in a terrifying fashion, and Dean and his friends thought it hilarious. I was angry at them, and angry at myself for having believed they'd just been up to some harmless fun. I smashed the “off” button and let the silence wash over me for a few minutes. Then I stepped outside and left the radio behind.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Life of crime is over, reputed Mafioso says; Riccardo Gattuso; Repentance comes as fresh allegations surface</b>
</div><div>Adrian Humphreys </div>
<div>National Post</div>
<div>702 words</div><div>26 September 2009</div><div>National Post</div><div>FINP</div><div>National</div><div>A14</div><div>English</div><div>(c) 2009 National Post . All Rights Reserved. </div>
</p>
<p>A convicted Mafia member from Italy who was arrested as he arrived at the Toronto airport said he has turned his back on his life of crime and only wants to live peacefully here with his family.</p>
<p>The plea of repentance from Riccardo Gattuso, 39, came, however, as new allegations were made that he sat on the Mafia's Board of Control while he lived here.</p>
<p>"I'm a father with a family. A father of two kids with a nice wife. That's who I think I am now," Mr. Gattuso told the National Post in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>"I was charged 20 years ago for these things. I paid my price, my debt, and now I am free," he said in a mix of English and Italian.</p>
<p>"I want to bring my family back to live here. We were better living in Canada."</p>
<p>That dream may be difficult given his unfavourable legal standing and a dossier summarizing allegations presented yesterday by the Canada Border Services Agency at an Immigration and Refugee hearing.</p>
<p>Mr. Gattuso was named as a member of the 'Ndrangheta, the name of the Mafia formed in Italy's Calabria region, and as a member of its Board of Control for the Toronto area, said Stephanie Echlin, a CBSA lawyer.</p>
<p>The board consists of six or seven members and resolves disputes and organizes the competing enterprises of different 'Ndrangheta clans in order to avoid territorial disputes, Ms. Echlin said.</p>
<p>Sitting on the board, she said, "is a sure sign of respect" from Toronto-area gangsters.</p>
<p>Mr. Gattuso was convicted in Calabria in 1991 for two counts of possessing weapons and ammunition; in 1992 for receiving stolen goods; and in 1996 for Mafia association.</p>
<p>He was once suspected in Italy of being recruited as a hit man in a savage family feud that claimed dozens of victims in Italy and Canada but was never charged.</p>
<p>Mr. Gattuso's uncle was convicted of murder in Italy after he flew to Toronto and killed the last victim in the mob vendetta.</p>
<p>In late 1998, an arrest warrant was issued in Italy for his failing to comply with release conditions but authorities could not find him.</p>
<p>Days later he arrived in Canada on an "apparently fraudulent" passport, Ms. Echlin said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gattuso married in Canada and has two children and lived here almost six years as a fugitive.</p>
<p>In 2005 he was issued an exclusion order, making him ineligible to be in Canada.</p>
<p>Mr. Gattuso's lawyer, Mendel Green, said his client just wants to live in Canada legally rather than as a fugitive.</p>
<p>"He is not now involved in any Mafia organized crime association," Mr. Green said.</p>
<p>"He has had a total rehabilitation of his past character."</p>
<p>Since his release from Italian prison he has safely returned twice to Canada, most recently in February.</p>
<p>This Wednesday, however, he was stopped by border officials and arrested on the grounds that he failed to disclose his convictions in Italy.</p>
<p>He was travelling alone because one of his children is suffering from the H1N1 virus and his wife remained in Italy to be with the children.</p>
<p>He will face an immigration admissibility hearing to determine if he can remain in Canada.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Gattuso appeared via a video link from jail wearing a bright orange prison jumpsuit for a detention review during which he was denied bail.</p>
<p>IRB adjudicator Harry Adamidis ruled that evidence suggests Mr. Gattuso should be considered a danger to the public and he was unlikely to appear for an immigration hearing if released.</p>
<p>Mr. Adamidis was also concerned about an unexplained application in Canada by Mr. Gattuso for a Firearms Acquisition Certificate, the first step in legally obtaining a gun.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Mr. Gattuso is being kept in solitary confinement at Toronto West detention centre.</p>
<p>"Canada, being such a democratic country; I came to Canada with a smile on my face and they do this to me," Mr. Gattuso told the National Post. "They have me in solitary confinement. I can't believe it."</p>

<p>Louise Harel's ducking of a debate in English among the candidates for mayor of Montreal is no great loss to anyone except Gérald Tremblay.</p>
<p>Anglophones are already used to voting in provincial elections without having heard the party leaders debate in their language.</p>
<p>There hasn't been an English-language leaders' debate during a Quebec election campaign since 1985, when one was held on radio.</p>
<p>Tremblay could have used the free air time to try to get out the anti-Harel vote among anglophones, which appears to be the only thing that might save him.</p>
<p>But for Harel to try to debate in a language she doesn't really speak would have been an excruciating waste of time for both her and any listener who isn't a masochist. She has little hope of winning over anglophones, and francophones aren't likely to vote for her out of pity.</p>
<p>And while three-quarters of Montrealers polled by Angus Reid Strategies for La Presse said it's important for their next mayor to be bilingual, it hasn't stopped Harel from maintaining a slight lead over Tremblay in popularity.</p>
<p>So there is a good chance that the next mayor of Montreal will be someone who is less functionally bilingual than the average 12-year-old graduate of one of the city's English elementary schools.</p>
<p>In that category, Harel would join that other symbol of resistance to assimilation, Pauline Marois, who as leader of the Parti Québécois in the National Assembly is a general election away from becoming premier of Quebec.</p>
<p>To think that in this province 50 years ago, a unilingual francophone couldn't get promoted to shop foreman, and 40 years ago, a unilingual anglophone still earned more than a bilingual francophone.</p>
<p>But the tables have turned. Now bilingual anglophones earn less than bilingual francophones with similar qualifications, according to the government's Office québécois de la langue française.</p>
<p>And a unilingual francophone can seriously aspire to the highest political offices in the province and its biggest cities - which even a fluently bilingual anglophone cannot.</p>
<p>There hasn't been an anglophone mayor of Montreal since James Guerin completed his term in 1912.</p>
<p>And no anglophone has been premier or led a major party in a general election in Quebec since the 19th century - or at least nobody who is openly anglophone has. If, as some suspect, the one baptized John James Charest is really an anglophone, he hasn't come out of the closet.</p>
<p>Members of francophone minorities have recently been heads of government in Canada and predominantly English-speaking New Brunswick. But in Quebec, there's an unwritten rule that an anglophone need not apply for the job of premier.</p>
<p>Usually, the rule's existence is acknowledged in the political class only privately. But in a 2005 CROP survey, 40 per cent of francophones expressed opposition to having an anglophone premier.</p>
<p>Apparently, the rule even extends to the most important provincial cabinet portfolios. A Quebec anglophone, Brian Mulroney, could grow up to be prime minister of Canada. But no anglophone has been deemed qualified to hold the province's health portfolio since 1966, finance since 1944 or education ever.</p>
<p>Charest's two "anglophone" ministers (Yolande James and Kathleen Weil distance themselves from the English-speaking community as though it's the H1N1 virus) both sit below the salt at the cabinet table. They rank 14th and 18th among the 26 ministers in order of protocol, below even the more recently appointed Clément Gignac.</p>
<p>And both are fluently bilingual, unlike many of their more senior colleagues.</p>
<p>As for anglophones who are as linguistically challenged as Harel and Marois, the highest political office that is left to them is mayor of a small, predominantly English-speaking town - or captain of the Montreal Canadiens.</p>

<p>When Jennifer Madar's twin girls were born premature at 29 weeks, she dropped her usual wariness about flu shots and got one right away</p>
<p>So did her husband, her father and anyone else she thought would come into close contact with her girls.</p>
<p>"My babies had spent almost three months in the neonatal intensive care unit," Madar recalled. "So when they came home, it was very important that they not get sick. We didn't want to take the chance of one of us getting the flu and passing it on to them." Three years later, Madar's girls - Jessica and Romy - are the picture of health with their rosy cheeks and blond curls, romping around their living room in St. Laurent and often testing the limits of their mother's patience.</p>
<p>The family is also expanding as the 35-year-old Madar is pregnant again and expects to give birth to a boy in December. At 29 weeks, she's in her third trimester - and is therefore considered by public-health authorities to be on the priority list to get the influenza A (H1N1) vaccine.</p>
<p>So are her children, but this time Madar isn't so sure about rolling up her sleeve for a flu shot.</p>
<p>"I'm going to have to get a little bit more informed about it," she said. "But I have to tell you the truth. For me, it's a new vaccine and I'm kind of reluctant, because you never know about possible side effects. I'm just worried about the things that they might discover down the line." Madar isn't alone in her misgivings about the H1N1 vaccine. A U.S. public opinion survey released this week found that only 40 per cent of parents said they will get their children vaccinated against the H1N1 virus (while 54 per cent indicated they would give their kids the regular seasonal flu shot.) Even some health professionals have expressed doubts. In a poll of more than 2,000 Hong Kong health workers, researchers discovered that during the height of the global swine flu panic in May, less than half were willing to get inoculated.</p>
<p>(This week, a pregnant nurse at the Lakeshore General Hospital emailed The Gazette, saying she was having qualms about the H1N1 vaccine. This, despite the fact that two pregnant women in Quebec died over the summer from H1N1 complications.) To vaccinate or not to vaccinate - that is rapidly becoming the question of 2009.</p>
<p>Acknowledging the public skepticism about the upcoming H1N1 vaccination campaign, Canada's obstetricians and gynecologists are mounting an information blitz aimed at pregnant women. Posters and fact sheets are being sent to hospitals, clinics and doctor's offices. Physicians are being told to provide advance prescriptions to pregnant women for the antiviral drug Tamiflu that could be filled at the first sign of H1N1 symptoms.</p>
<p>All of this is predicated on the fact that H1N1 is a relatively new strain and has killed a disproportionately higher number of young people than the seasonal flu. What's more, the World Health Organization has declared an H1N1 pandemic emergency, and has warned that a second, perhaps deadlier, wave of infections is imminent this fall.</p>
<p>Alain Poirier, Quebec's public health director, noted that pregnant women in their second and third trimesters are at an elevated risk of developing serious complications should they contract H1N1.</p>
<p>Although the death toll from H1N1 in Quebec is lower than initially feared - it stands at 27 - vaccination is still the best protection, he insisted.</p>
<p>"I'm sure that those people (who died) would have liked to have had the vaccine," Poirier told reporters two weeks ago.</p>
<p>In Quebec, the government's H1N1 response is akin to a war-time mobilization. It has purchased 53 million pairs of gloves, 23 million masks and 15 million syringes.</p>
<p>The government has ordered 11.5 million doses of the vaccine from GlaxoSmith-Kline's Quebec City plant for the province's 7.5 million residents. Starting in mid-November, about 100 clinics across the province will vaccinate 200,000 people a day, seven days a week.</p>
<p>In addition to pregnant women, children age six months to five years will be immunized first. They will likely be given a second booster shot, because their immune systems are not yet fully developed. As for those under six months, the vaccine has been shown not to work on them.</p>
<p>Health professionals, people from the ages of five to 18, police and firefighters, and those age 18 to 65 would follow. Paradoxically, the elderly who are usually highly susceptible to the regular flu appear to have some immunity to H1N1.</p>
<p>Yet the question persists - to vaccinate or not?</p>
<p>The doubts about the H1N1 vaccine arise from the perception that it's being rushed into production and foisted on the public without being tested sufficiently, that it might not be effective, and that it might not even be necessary since the virus has so far proved to be less severe than anticipated.</p>
<p>Adding to the confusion is the fact that Canada has decided to use an adjuvant or immunity-boosting chemical in the vaccine, while the United States has opted for one composed wholly of dead fragments of the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>And none of these concerns address the question about whether to go ahead with a separate vaccine to guard against the seasonal flu, which kills tens of thousands of people worldwide each year.</p>
<p>Experts readily concede that the H1N1 vaccine is being rolled out with great haste, but argue they have no other choice as they brace for a second wave of the pandemic. Usually a new vaccine for a disease like hepatitis can take five years before it's approved.</p>
<p>But it's a different story with the seasonal flu vaccine. It's produced from scratch every year because flu viruses mutate constantly. Typically, such vaccines contain fragments of three flu strains.</p>
<p>In contrast, the H1N1 vaccine is monovalent, containing fragments of only one virus.</p>
<p>"We're fast-tracking the approval of this vaccine and for obvious reasons, because we are on the threshold of a pandemic, if we're not already in it," said Karl Weiss, a microbiologist at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital.</p>
<p>"We have already accepted the vaccine not having the full results. I agree that it has to be fast-tracked. You have to put it in the global context. This is not what we usually do, and there are certain questions for which nobody has the answer."</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span> unveiled results of a preliminary study of its vaccine, noting that a single dose confers almost 100 per cent immunity from H1N1 three weeks after vaccination. The results were from a clinical trial involving 130 healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 60.</p>
<p>A study of this size is useful to spot any immediate danger signs with a new vaccine, but the world will only learn the full range of possible side effects once hundreds of thousands of people are inoculated.</p>
<p>"Nothing serious will happen out of nowhere," Weiss said. "But there is the potential that after you've given it to 100,000 people, you might see three cases of liver issues, let's say, which is more than you would expect for something like this. At that point, people would have to take a decision."</p>
<p>Weiss, however, was certain about one thing: For those who have been confirmed to have been infected by H1N1, getting the vaccine would not be a good idea. That's because their immune systems could overreact horribly.</p>
<p>Richard Schabas, the medical officer of health for Ontario's Hastings and Prince Edward Counties and a long-time critic of the WHO, said people shouldn't worry about the safety of the H1N1 vaccine.</p>
<p>"I'm not particularly concerned about the risk profile of the vaccine," he added. "We've been producing influenza vaccine for many years. It's a very safe vaccine. And we've been putting adjuvants in vaccines for years. Their safety profile is excellent."</p>
<p>What Schabas finds fault with is the recommendation by public-health authorities to vaccinate every man, woman and child in Canada against H1N1. He also takes issue with the decision to add the adjuvant, saying that has probably delayed the delivery of the vaccine by several weeks, raising the possibility that many people will get the shot only after a second wave hits.</p>
<p>The Canadian Medical Association Journal took a similar position about the adjuvant in an editorial last month. "Having enough vaccine for every Canadian would make more sense if the pandemic virus were highly virulent for large proportions of the population," the editorial concluded. "But given current evidence, it seems a poorer choice than providing coverage to high-risk groups as early as possible."</p>
<p>Schabas contends that it's Canadians who suffer from pre-existing medical conditions like diabetes, morbid obesity as well as heart and lung disease who should get vaccinated.</p>
<p>"For the general population who don't fall into these categories - healthy people are at a very low risk of H1N1," he said. "I'm not saying that pregnant women shouldn't be immunized, but to describe them all as a high-risk group I think misrepresents the data."</p>
<p>Almost lost in the debate over the H1N1 vaccine is whether to proceed with the seasonal flu vaccine. In fact, the WHO has also recommended a trivalent vaccine for the northern hemisphere this year to protect against three viruses that are not part of the pandemic. One of those viruses, H3N2, has been shown to have sickened many people around the world.</p>
<p>Initially, the government suggested dropping the seasonal vaccine, but late yesterday it announced a compromise: It would put off the seasonal flu vaccinations until January. One of the reasons cited for staggering the two campaigns is that those who have been vaccinated in the past against the seasonal flu appeared to be more susceptible to H1N1. Therefore, it makes more sense to give the H1N1 shot first.</p>
<p>In practical terms, however, this means that adults will have to weigh the pros and cons of getting two different vaccines in one flu season for the first time in their lives. And parents will face the daunting prospect of getting four flu shots for children age six months to two years. That's because children in this age group require booster shots.</p>
<p>Paul Saba, a family physician who runs a practice in Montreal West and a father of three young children, said he believes that both vaccines are necessary.</p>
<p>"They should have both, and if it means paying doctors and nurses more or opening the clinics for longer hours, then so be it," he said. "You won't want the elderly who usually get the regular flu to die. We shouldn't let them suffer, either."</p>
<p>To vaccinate or not to vaccinate - there are no clear answers. But for Weiss, that's the whole nature of medicine, weighing risks against benefits.</p>
<p>"We live in an environment in which people would like to have a 100-per-cent guarantee that everything is safe and good," he said. "But we can't do that. There is some uncertainty.</p>
<p>"There is no guarantee that this vaccine will be 100-per-cent efficient. But chances are it's going to work."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Spanish flu pandemic a stark precedent</b>
</div><div>Aaron Derfel   </div>

<div>635 words</div><div>26 September 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Much of the rationale behind the decision by governments around the world to launch massive flu vaccination campaigns against the H1N1 virus is the fear of a second wave of much deadlier infections.</p>
<p>There is a stark historical precedent for this in the 1918-19 Spanish flu pandemic. Estimates vary, but it's believed that at least 50 million people died from a swine-flu subtype of H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>That pandemic occurred in three waves over 10 months. The second wave was by far the most lethal. Most people died at the end of October.</p>
<p>Ninety years later, epidemiologists are struck by a number of parallels between the Spanish flu and today's declared pandemic.</p>
<p>First, the viruses are both H1N1. Second, children, teens and young adults are particularly susceptible to catching the virus today, as they were in 1918. And third, there is already some increased H1N1 flu activity in parts of the world (including the Beecher Bay First Nation reserve on Vancouver Island), signalling a second wave.</p>
<p>But that's where the similarities end, and the differences might well be more significant.</p>
<p>No one knows for certain what the death rate was from the Spanish flu, but most experts suspect that it was at least two per cent. That means that out of every 1,000 people infected, 20 people died.</p>
<p>During a regular flu season, the mortality rate is less than one-tenth of one per cent. Even at such a low rate, the seasonal flu kills up to half a million people globally every year, mostly the frail and elderly.</p>
<p>Initially, as the H1N1 virus spread from Mexico in late April, figures from the World Health Organization suggested that the death rate was in line with the seasonal flu. This was true for Quebec as well.</p>
<p>But then the mortality rate appears to have crept up as H1N1 swept the globe. A WHO report made public yesterday noted that the cumulative worldwide total of H1N1 infections as of Sept. 20 was 318,925, and of that number 3,917 people have died.</p>
<p>Based on those numbers, the mortality rate is one per cent, which would be 10 times deadlier than the seasonal flu and perhaps half as deadly as the Spanish flu. But the WHO was quick to point out that countries are no longer required to test and report individual cases, so "the number of cases reported actually understates the real number of cases."</p>
<p>In other words, the death rate from H1N1 is probably lower than one per cent.</p>
<p>A report last week by the U.S. Centres for Disease Control and Prevention observed that since Sept. 28 of last year, the CDC had confirmed 117 influenza-associated pediatric deaths. Of that number, 49 were blamed on the H1N1 virus.</p>
<p>By comparison, the CDC reported 88 pediatric deaths during the 2007-2008 flu season.</p>
<p>Marc Lipsitch, a professor of epidemiology at Harvard University, told a meeting of flu experts in Washington this month that the H1N1 death rate compares to a moderate year of seasonal influenza.</p>
<p>Richard Schabas, a public health officer in Ontario, noted that the H1N1 activity in Australia, which has just gone through its winter, was no worse than the seasonal flu. And that bodes well for Canada, he said.</p>
<p>He accused the WHO and other public-health authorities - which have a vested interest in promoting their agendas - of unnecessarily causing panic.</p>
<p>"There's no reason to think that the influenza we're going to see this fall and winter - which will probably be totally H1N1 - is going to be more virulent than what we've seen," Schabas said. "I don't subscribe to that theory at all. I think that's unscientific fear-mongering."</p>

</p>
<p>When Mel Gibson put Jesus back on the cross and racked up more than $611 million US worldwide on a $30-million production budget in early 2004, the movie industry could do little but praise the Lord.</p>
<p>After a decades-long bout with godlessness, Hollywood rediscovered and redefined its Holy Trinity -- not as Father, Son and Holy Ghost -- but as narrow-niche marketing, converted and well-conditioned audience, and spiritual subject matter.</p>
<p>The mix of these three specific elements not only ignited the passion of moviegoers, it made theatre owners and movie producers believe there may well be more to the Everyman's entertainment impulse than mere escapism.</p>
<p>People may, despite everything we've been told about our collective hedonism, amorality and sexual addictions, actually crave a hint of enlightenment with our daily celebrity fix. The immediate result was a short run of religious stories adapted for the screen, from Catherine Hardwicke's The Nativity Story to Ridley Scott's Kingdom of Heaven. They did not conjure the same magic at the box-office, nor for that matter did Gibson's historical Mexican epic and follow-up, Apocalypto.</p>
<p>From this, we could conclude Hollywood lost interest in creating a specifically religious or spiritual product, but the murky truth of the matter is far more complex -- and more intriguing.</p>
<p>Given the larger God construct fell out of vogue, many critics and academics have suggested movies assumed the place of the Sunday service, and replaced organized social connectedness and morality-based narratives with a relatively random series of stories that either affirmed a selection of religious ideas, or flattened them like a brittle Communion wafer.</p>
<p>In other words, the local multiplex is in many ways the modern equivalent of a place of worship -- only we aren't worshipping a formal God idea.</p>
<p>We're in collective awe of something literally "larger-than-life" that may illuminate our way forward, and give us guidance about life's deeper meaning.</p>
<p>The modern movie is like religion in the way it tells stories, demonstrates various ways of problem-solving and offers a moral lattice as well as appropriate codes of behaviour via a given text.</p>
<p>From this perspective, just about any movie could offer a "religious" or "spiritual" experience depending on the needs of the individual viewer, but in light of the Dalai Lama's visit to Vancouver -- not to mention second round of swine flu waiting in the wings and continuing job losses throughout the country, here's a look at some memorable movies that were either embraced as religious experiences, reaffirmed a shaky sense of modern spirituality or else tried too hard to push a God concept into two dimensions, and failed miserably.</p>
<p>Star Wars (1977)</p>
<p>If there were any single movie that could be described as a "religious experience" for the masses, it's George Lucas's epic about a young man on a quest to understand and embrace "The Force." With the very name Luke Skywalker, Lucas baited his spiritual hook with allusions to Christian gospel (Luke) and New Age symbolism with a sci-fi sound (Skywalker).</p>
<p>As a result, despite a matinee story about an evil emperor and a band of outlaws determined to see justice, the movie managed to transcend its basic cowboy bits and pieces and move people in an entirely unexpected way.</p>
<p>Sucked in by eye-popping action and groundbreaking special effects -- because let's face it, seeing is believing -- audiences grew giddy about "The Force." It struck a near-primal and yet spiritual chord, and really made us believe we have potential beyond our apparent physical limitations.</p>
<p>The movie and the subsequent franchise continue to be the most popular Hollywood saga ever, which not only proves its staying power, but the fervour with which people embraced the Lucas gospel.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Star Wars fan-boy following shares a lot in common with fundamentalist sects in its intolerance of criticism and the passion of conviction possessed by the faithful -- making Star Wars a starry-eyed ecstasy that continues to shape our times.</p>
<p>The Matrix (1999)</p>
<p>The very idea of Keanu Reeves as God is a tough sell. His hair is just too good. Then again, did you ever see a representation of that carpenter named Jesus with anything but a glorious do (providing one can overlook the bloody crown of thorns in the crucifixion pix)?</p>
<p>Indeed, Reeves pulled off the Herculean task of becoming a man and a god at once as Neo, or "The One."</p>
<p>The "One" tag always comes with a boatload of expectations, and they usually involve miracles, but in one of the most memorable scenes of the decade, Reeves's Neo takes a deep breath and finds a way to move faster than a bullet. He discovers his mind is stronger than the consensus default program he thought was "reality" -- or The Matrix -- and asserts his own power in the moment. His belief becomes reality, and in that image of self-determination, audiences found an echo of self and spiritual faith -- as well as a Cartesian wake-up call about the problems surrounding "rational" truth: We may think, therefore we are, but in what form?</p>
<p>Neo has a choice between waking up to his physical reality with one pill, or descending back into a collective dream state with another. In affirming an idea of free will with godlike notions of a Chosen One, The Matrix cobbled together a modern take on spirituality and reaffirmed the idea we are the masters of our own universe.</p>
<p>The Passion of the Christ (2004)</p>
<p>When this movie came out, it caused such a sensation, it became a flashpoint for all sorts of issues surrounding religion. From accusations of Mel Gibson being anti-Semitic, to the idea of marketing campaigns and commercial applications for church congregations, The Passion ignited a pyre of controversy that poked a white-hot tongue at a long-festering pop culture blister and let us see what was inside.</p>
<p>Turned out, it wasn't all that pretty as most of the dialogue devolved into a modern stoning. But hey, sometimes it's good to know we haven't changed all that much since the days of Jesus.</p>
<p>As for the movie itself, Gibson was obviously trying to show how much Jesus loved humanity by letting us see how much he suffered, but it's distasteful, base and sadistic to make someone watch a man being flogged to the bone. It feels wrong, and denies transcendence.</p>
<p>Jesus of Montreal (1989)</p>
<p>The title of Denys Arcand's masterpiece might lend the impression this movie about an actor playing Jesus for a Passion Play at St. Joseph's Oratory is about Christianity, or religion, but it's not. Sure, the manifestations of religion lurk in every corner of the frame, but the movie is about the very real, very fragile, and altogether human side of experience as the actor playing Christ (Lothaire Bluteau) ends up dying after being hung on a cross. The injury is an accident, and he dies shortly afterward in a Metro station -- but altogether alone and friendless. Arcand is bleak, to be sure, but like his later and equally brilliant film Barbarian Invasions, he finds a way to make a single human life so beautiful and flawed, so radiant and unique, that we can't help but feel moved by our capacity to love in spite of all the selfish grief that surrounds us, and the idea that no one may be keeping moral score at all.</p>
<p>The Celebration (1998)</p>
<p>Thomas Vinterberg's Dogme film features a single camera moving through one family's breakdown like a ghost, bearing witness to life-changing testimony that's been hidden for years. It's a harsh piece of work about abuse and denial, but because it all felt so mind-alteringly believable -- and yet oddly surreal thanks to the hovering, hand-held camera -- Vinterberg allowed his audience to float through a series of heart-wrenching frames without forcing us to lose faith in goodness. In watching people move through the worst, and suffer, but survive and forgive, The Celebration exalts the human spirit from the very cellar of experience.</p>
<p>Bambi (1942)</p>
<p>Anyone looking for a key to an entire generation's shaking faith should look no further than this subversive masterpiece from the master of his own world, <span class="companylink">Walt Disney</span>. Hollywood likes to affirm godlike ideas with the guarantee of a happy ending, but in the opening scenes of this cartoon directed by David Hand, Bambi's mother dies. Not even Nietzsche killed off a poor, innocent doe. Bambi isn't really a spiritual movie in any way, but it did push millions of us into a premature state of existential angst, and made us question the naive idea that God's presence guarantees a happy ending.</p>
<p>The Da Vinci Code (2006)</p>
<p>Zoinks! Ron Howard tried to go for a transcendent thriller with Tom Hanks playing prophet, but it's a Dan-Brown shame this film adaptation completely missed the magic between the printed lines. Brown's book teased at a wizened desire to really believe in the Jesus story in a whole new, and strangely plausible, way. Those who read the book could fill in the blanks and create their own connections, but Howard plays it all out in the film and explains everything in such detail, the film becomes a lecture instead of an inspiration.</p>
<p>Kundun (1997)</p>
<p>You have to give Martin Scorsese credit for being so sincere in his attempt to chronicle the life of the 14th Dalai Lama, even if Kundun doesn't necessarily fire on all cylinders as a movie. What does work are Roger Deakins's visuals, which immediately give Scorsese's vision a timeless grandeur, and the internal narrative about a boy who learns to embrace a larger-than-life responsibility. The movie can't possibly hope to communicate the deeper principles of Buddhism through any physical means, so like any movie -- or any painting -- that attempts to show us the divine in two dimensions, it's destined to fail without an accompaniment of faith. And that, depends entirely on the viewer.</p>
<p>Mystic Ball (2006)</p>
<p>Sports is one of the central pillars of what we have come to understand as the human ideal, as well as a potentially spiritual pursuit in itself. In this small, low-budget and very personal documentary from Toronto-based director Greg Hamilton, the very premise of competitive sports is taken to the mat as Hamilton discovers a unique athletic activity called Chinlone. Played only in Myanmar, Chinlone has teams, but there is nothing competitive about the game at all. There are no winners or losers, just shared transcendence. A seminal version of hackey sack, Chinlone brings groups of people together in the hopes of keeping a straw ball in the air for as long as possible. The moves to keep the ball airborne, however, are a complex mix of ballet and martial arts with its own meaning. Watching Hamilton fall in love with Chinlone, we begin to see how cooperation instead of competition can free the soul -- making it one of the most spiritually rewarding movies you will ever see.</p>
<p>Last Night (1998)</p>
<p>End-of-days scenarios are always ripe for spiritual squeezing, and while most pre-Y2K disaster films such as Deep Impact and Armageddon -- and no doubt the forthcoming 2012 -- opt for the deliriously detailed special effects showing our cities crumbling and our oceans rising, Last Night went for the psychological narrative, and how our entire species will cope with our pending doom. Each character tries to find some personal shred of meaning through various tools and last-minute achievements, but it's the final sequence in this Don McKellar jewel that reaffirms the real magic, and the real beauty, of human existence -- even if it's in our last breath -- as two people determined to commit suicide decide to embrace, kiss and surrender to forces greater than themselves.</p>

<p>Canada has ordered 1.8 million doses of unadjuvanted swine flu vaccine for pregnant women and children under the age of three, Canada's chief public health officer said Friday.</p>
<p>Adjuvants are substances added to vaccines to boost a person's immune response to the shots.</p>
<p>While the adjuvant to be used in Canada's H1N1 vaccine -- an oil-in-water emulsion -- is similar to one that has been used in Europe, Dr. David Butler-Jones said there's not yet enough clinical data on using adjuvanted vaccines in pregnant women and young children.</p>
<p>Those groups will have the option of using an unadjuvanted vaccine, he said.</p>

<p>The federal Liberals said Friday they would ban all taxpayer funded "politicized" government advertising if they come to power.</p>
<p>Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff said his party would appoint an independent body to ensure all government advertising is free of political content.</p>
<p>The pledge comes after it was revealed the Harper government had spent about $40 million on advertising its economic plan, compared with only $6.5 million to educate Canadians about swine flu.</p>
<p>Ignatieff called the government's advertising priorities a "flagrant" misuse of public funds.</p>
