</p>
<p>Two Quebec companies specializing in anti-microbial face masks are scrambling to meet growing demand resulting from the spreading swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>"This flu pandemic has been an accelerator for us," André Leroux, CEO and chairman of Montreal's Noveko International Inc., said yesterday.</p>
<p>"People are even more interested in our technology now," he said, adding that Mexican officials called the company yesterday to say they want Noveko's masks "big time."</p>
<p>Local drug stores are reporting a brisk run on their stock since Sunday.</p>
<p>As of mid-afternoon yesterday, many shelves had been emptied.</p>
<p>Pharmacist Judith Phan of a Uniprix pharmacy downtown said she had turned away five people by 2 p.m.</p>
<p>"I had one man who told me he already tried three other pharmacies," Pham said. "I'm expecting more people will come in - we've re-ordered."</p>
<p>An east-end Jean Coutu was also out of stock, while a Parmaprix had just one mask left. "We usually sell about one a day. We sold eight," a clerk said.</p>
<p>Leroux suggested that at least 6 million masks distributed by the military in Mexico City so far have been ordinary ones that aren't anti-microbial and therefore have probably already been contaminated.</p>
<p>The flu is "very good news for us," said Benoit Sicotte general manager of Triosyn Research Inc. in Mirabel. "It gives our company better exposure."</p>
<p>The phones began ringing off the hook at the end of last week.</p>

</p>
<p>An ad hoc committee of the Quebec cabinet has been created to monitor the spread of swine flu, Premier Jean Charest said yesterday.</p>
<p>"We will keep the public informed," Charest said at the start of hearings on the spending estimates of Quebec's executive council.</p>
<p>Charest noted there are three cases of suspected swine flu in the province. The patients are under observation but are not in hospital, he said.</p>
<p>The premier said the government is not considering travel restrictions, and said he would go to Mexico.</p>
<p>"There are more Quebecers who go to Mexico than there are Mexicans who come to Quebec," he added.</p>
<p>"And I don't think that will stop. We're not recommending to people at this point not to travel to Mexico, but we are going to give advice on what they should do."</p>

</div><div>MONIQUE BEAUDIN, CHERYL CORNACCHIA   </div>

<p>Travellers arriving from Mexico City at Dorval's Trudeau airport last night said despite the growing number of swine flu cases in Mexico, they weren't worried about their own health.</p>
<p>They described Mexico's capital as quiet, its streets deserted, with many people there wearing masks to cover their faces.</p>
<p>But some people on an Air Canada flight that arrived last night had changed their travel plans to leave the country sooner than originally planned, said Joanne La-ramée, who had a blue mask hanging around her neck.</p>
<p>"I don't know if they were afraid, but they wanted to leave earlier," she said, adding that she isn't afraid of getting sick.</p>
<p>About 75 per cent of the passengers on her plane, as well as the flight crew, wore masks, Laramée said.</p>
<p>Two flights arrived in Montreal from Mexico City last night. Expected on board a Mexicana Airlines flight were 75 migrant workers who are coming to work on farms all over Quebec, said René Mantha of the Fondation des entreprises en recrutement de main-d'oeuvre étrangère. Another 130 workers are expected to arrive Thursday, Mantha said. More than 3,000 migrant workers are expected to come to Quebec this summer to work on farms around the province.</p>
<p>Roch Fortin, who runs the Terre à Terre organic farm in Ripon, north of Montebello, was waiting last night for a worker who is returning to his farm for the fifth year. Fortin said he was not worried about the outbreak of swine flu affecting his operations, adding that he had been in Mexico himself last week.</p>
<p>All of the workers arriving last night were examined by two doctors before leaving Mexico, Mantha said. No producers were requiring the workers to take precautions here in Quebec, such as wearing masks, he said.</p>
<p>Isaac Morales Martinez, who has worked at a farm in Lavaltrie for four years, said last night that all the workers had to fill out a form that had a list of symptoms - such as a runny nose, sore throat and headache. A doctor checked the form, said Martinez, but he was not examined by a medical professional before leaving the country.</p>
<p>Many of the workers wore masks and then took them off in the arrivals area.</p>
<p>When she arrived at Dorval, Arantxa Chavez said she was examined by a doctor who listened to her chest and examined her throat.</p>
<p>"I'm okay, I'm healthy," said Chavez, who is in Montreal for a diving competition. Other divers travelling with her wore masks as they entered the arrivals hall at Dorval.</p>
<p>But several other passengers interviewed by The Gazette said they had not been examined by any medical personnel before leaving Mexico, nor at the airport here.</p>

<p>Based on what we know right now, the swine flu scare doesn't pose a massive danger to your economic health, although it is likely to cause some pain.</p>
<p>Of course, we don't know nearly as much as we need to, so this reassurance must be taken with a few grains of salt.</p>
<p>At best, this new variant of flu will prove to be mild, not even requiring hospitalization for most patients. That's the case where it has already spread in small numbers, including Canada, the United States and Europe.</p>
<p>But in Mexico, where the outbreak started, there's been a rising death toll. As of yesterday, there was no good explanation for this difference, and it suggests some risk of an uglier outcome.</p>
<p>Still, based on the best information they have, analysts don't see a disastrous event.</p>
<p>Brian Bethune, chief financial economist at IHS Global Insight, a big Boston consulting firm, suggests a reasonable guess is that swine flu has the potential to slice U.S. economic output by less than half of one percentage point.</p>
<p>That's "kind of a mid-case scenario, where you do get some spreading, but there is a pro-active response" from authorities, Bethune said yesterday.</p>
<p>Of course, even if half a percentage point of lost growth isn't huge, it's significant when we're in the grip of a severe recession that only now appears to be easing its grip slightly.</p>
<p>For example, the IHS Global Insight forecast for the U.S. already predicts a 3.5-per-cent decline in economic activity this year, so another half-point lost would imply a slower or later recovery - maybe both.</p>
<p>The good news is that this added pain is nothing compared with a worst-case scenario the World Bank outlined last year for a truly deadly flu pandemic. Such an event could bring 70 million deaths around the world and a recession several times worse than the current one.</p>
<p>But there's little sign today of such a catastrophe.</p>
<p>First, despite the worrisome death toll in Mexico, experience with this new strain of flu suggests it's less virulent than avian flu.</p>
<p>It also seems to respond well to existing flu drugs, like Tamiflu, that diminish the severity of the illness, say analysts at Capital Economics, a British firm.</p>
<p>Better still, thanks to earlier avian-flu scares, most industrial nations, including Canada, already have stockpiles of such drugs.</p>
<p>Given this, maybe one hint of what Canada could experience this year would be the outbreak in 2003 of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. The sometimes deadly viral disease afflicted southern China, neighbouring Asian countries and spread to the Toronto area, but was subdued within months.</p>
<p>The SARS outbreak briefly devastated travel to Canada, slicing 0.6 per cent from the country's annual growth rate in the second quarter of 2003. Two-thirds of the lost growth was recovered by the end of the year, however, a Bank of Canada analysis estimated.</p>
<p>A similar pattern could be seen this time unless swine flu turns out to be exceptionally deadly, said Philip Cross, head of economic analysis at Statistics Canada.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he said, it is "absolutely not" likely to cause deep, long-run damage to economic growth.</p>
<p>SARS did hit stock markets hard, but they bounced back smartly, notes Stéfane Marion, chief economist at the National Bank. After losing about 14 per cent from mid-January to mid-March 2003, the S&P 500 index of major U.S. stocks rebounded even more strongly, rising nearly 23 per cent by the outbreak's official end in July.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No need to panic, economists advise; Swine flu scare: 'Canada is very well prepared'</b>
</div><div>DAVID AKIN   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>854 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B1 / BREAK</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The swine flu scare is likely to wreak significant economic damage on a world already coping with its worst recession since the 1930s.</p>
<p>But economists and market watchers also cautioned that, although the World Health Organization raised its threat level late yesterday from three to four on a scale of six, there is no evidence yet that a pandemic is imminent.</p>
<p>For economists, a pandemic exists when 15 to 35 per cent of a given population is ill, forcing a massive loss of productivity as employees are simply too sick to work.</p>
<p>"There's no evidence this will be a pandemic, but if it were, it shuts down national borders, it reduces the flow of goods and services between countries, and it leads therefore to significant supply shortages because no single country is self-reliant," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets.</p>
<p>After the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome crisis of 2002-03, Cooper wrote a report titled Don't Fear Fear or Panic Panic: An Economist's View of Pandemic. She looked at the ability of North America and the world to deal with a pandemic, how various pandemic scenarios might affect businesses, and how societies would still be able to provide food, energy and power.</p>
<p>"I think Canada is very well prepared. At this stage, there's no macroeconomic response required," she said in an interview yesterday.</p>
<p>"I do know that hospitals around the country are using their pandemic preparedness plans right now to make sure that, in the event this were to spread, they are ready."</p>
<p>Still, investors seemed spooked yesterday. Stocks of any business connected to travel were battered. Continental Airlines was among the worst affected, with its stock falling about 17 per cent.</p>
<p>During the six-month-long SARS crisis, airlines were particularly hard hit, with international air traffic declining by about 30 per cent.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of a barrel of oil was down by as much as $2, to below $50 at one point. Expectations of reduced energy prices helped push down the TSX more than 154 points.</p>
<p>On the other hand, investors in some niche antiviral research firms hit the jackpot. Biota Holdings Ltd., an Australian research and development company that sells the flu vaccine Relenza, saw one of its share issues jump 693 per cent yesterday.</p>
<p>There were also fears that some countries may use the swine flu as an excuse to put up new trade barriers.</p>
<p>Some countries - but not Canada or the United States - banned meat imports from Mexico. Ukraine went so far as to ban the import of pork products from Canada and any country where a case of swine flu has been reported.</p>
<p>Health officials in Canada and the U.S. say the swine flu virus, like any other flu virus, is transmitted to humans by coughing or touching and is not passed through the consumption of any kind of properly cooked pork.</p>
<p>Stéfane Marion, chief economist at National Bank Financial, said even the threat of a pandemic is likely to hurt global stock markets.</p>
<p>"Fears of pandemic had a very tangible impact on equity markets in 2003 with the outbreak of SARS, even though the number of people infected turned out to be small, as pandemics go," Marion said in a note to National Bank's clients.</p>
<p>From November 2002, when SARS was first reported, until late spring 2003, the Standard & Poor's 500 - a U.S. stock market index that tracks the performance of 500 companies - fell 14.7 per cent, although the market recouped those losses within weeks of the World Health Organization's ending the SARS alert in summer 2003.</p>
<p>The flu affects millions of Canadians each year, resulting in 20,000 admissions to hospital, on average, and 4,000 deaths. Normally, fewer than 0.1 per cent of people with no underlying medical conditions die of influenza.</p>
<p>Canadian farmers are concerned about the situation and applauded the federal government for appropriate action.</p>
<p>"They're not letting it slide. They're also not overreacting, either," said Ken Forth, a farmer and president of Foreign Agricultural Resource Management Service (FARMS), a group that matches up Canadian farmers' requests for foreign labour with governments in Mexico and Caribbean nations.</p>
<p>"They're monitoring the situation closely and I have some faith they'll take appropriate action."</p>
<p>Foreign agricultural workers are already required to pass a medical exam before they leave for Canada. Yesterday, Canadian officials said they would require that exam to be taken just prior to their departure.</p>
<p>As many as 15,000 Mexicans are expected to come to Canada this year as temporary workers in the country's fruit and vegetable growing regions.</p>
<p>Forth said many are already here.</p>

</div><div>FRANCOIS SHALOM   </div>
<div>The Gazette</div>
<div>705 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>B7</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Neither the human swine flu nor an earthquake in Mexico yesterday caused Canadians to stampede away from travel to that country's sunny climes, airlines reported.</p>
<p>Nor are Mexicans deterred from filling Mexicana Airlines' nine weekly flights between Montreal and Mexico City.</p>
<p>Mirna Pedrueza, of Mexicana Airlines' main office on Sherbrooke St., said her airline's flight 881 from Mexico City was full last night, scheduled to bring in 130 passengers at 8 p.m. on the Airbus 320.</p>
<p>Air Canada flight 994, also from Mexico's capital, was arriving at Dorval's Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport at the same time, but Air Canada officials did not return emails seeking comment.</p>
<p>Pedrueza said that at other than peak travel times for locals, like spring break or January and February, Mexicana's passengers tend to be Mexicans coming to Montreal on business or for leisure.</p>
<p>"We have had a couple of requests for travel changes or information, but that's it," she said.</p>
<p>But Montrealers can book on Mexicana through travel agencies, and Pedrueza said she would not know about inquiries or changes to those reservations.</p>
<p>In response to the outbreak, Air Canada and WestJet also announced arrangements for travellers to and from that country.</p>
<p>WestJet said its customers could "change or cancel the air portion of their travel arrangements at no charge, and travel at a future date."</p>
<p>Air Canada said it is waiving change fees for customers with reservations for travel to or from all destinations in Mexico up to May 6 "to facilitate changes to travel plans and allow for travel at a later date."</p>
<p>Both airlines said they are monitoring the situation and will provide further updates as the situation develops.</p>
<p>WestJet spokesperson Richard Bartrem said from Calgary that the carrier would provide a credit for future travel on WestJet. Customers have up to a year to use the credit and can use it on any destination WestJet flies to. He said the airline does not provide the number of travellers who are eligible for the credit. But "we have received a few dozen phone calls (concerning) the swine flu - roughly 30 calls." Some were for information only, not for changes or cancellations, Bartrem added.</p>
<p>It wasn't clear whether Air Canada is giving its customers a year to change their plans or whether they have until April 30 to make alternate plans.</p>
<p>Via Rail Canada also said it would waive service charges "for passengers changing their train reservations in cases where a connecting airline flight to or from Mexico has been affected by the current swine flu health alert. This policy is effective immediately and covers travel up to and including April 30.</p>
<p>Air Canada's Isabelle Arthur said in an earlier email that "no health authorities in Canada, the U.S., Mexico, or the (World Health Organization) - the competent health authorities in this matter - have recommended that travellers change their travel plans. They all advise taking standard, existing, preventive measures against influenza."</p>
<p>She and Bartrem urged those concerned - and the media - to consult the Public Health Agency of Canada - www.phac-aspc.gc.ca[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca] - for information, as well as websites of the CDC and the WHO.</p>
<p>"We have not seen an increase, or any significant number for that matter, in calls to our call centres - (Sunday or yesterday) - requesting changes to travel plans to Mexico, despite the fact that we have implemented a policy to waive change fees for ticket holders with flights until May 6th to Mexico City."</p>
<p>"It should be noted that the concentration of cases is in the Mexico City area, and not at beach resort destinations where most vacationers typically travel, and which remain unaffected."</p>
<p>For information: WestJet customers can call 1-888- WESTJET (937-8538). Air Canada: 1-888-247-2262, or 1-800-361-8071 for the hearing impaired. Passengers must contact the airlines by Thursday. Via Rail: Check at viarail.ca or at 1-888 VIARAIL (842-7245) or 1 (800) 268-9503 for the hearing impaired.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Be prepared for swine flu</b>
</div><div>THE RECORD</div>
<div>694 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A10</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>Do not be panicked by swine flu. Be alert. Be informed. And be sure your public health officials -- federal, provincial and regional -- are up to the job. It's a big one.</p>
<p>As of late yesterday, the illness had killed 150 people in Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak, and spread to enough other countries, including Canada and the United States, for the World Health Organization's emergency committee to raise the pandemic threat level for swine flu from phase three to four. This means there is now a sustained transmission of the flu from human to human.</p>
<p>While six cases of the influenza had been reported in Canada as of Monday, there were no new reports of people coming down with the disease during the day. Even so, Canada's chief public health officer David Butler-Jones said more cases -- and some deaths -- are expected in this country.</p>
<p>In an era of rapid global travel, where airports can become incubators for epidemics, the news of this virus is cause for concern. But people should know that, to a huge degree, they control their own fate. If they keep educating themselves and take sensible precautions, they can greatly limit their chances of contracting this new, infectious strain of swine flu.</p>
<p>Swine flu is a respiratory illness caused by an influenza virus that often triggers outbreaks in pigs. In this case, a strain of the virus is being transmitted from human to human.</p>
<p>The virus produces typical influenza symptoms -- high fever, muscle aches, vomiting, a cough and sore throat. Fortunately, the virus can be effectively treated by anti-viral drugs, including those Canadian health authorities have been stockpiling in case of a flu pandemic. But the treatment is most successful if it comes quickly, within 48 hours of exposure.</p>
<p>Of course, a gram of prevention beats a kilogram of cure. Individuals can and should take precautionary measures such as frequently washing their hands, covering their mouths and noses with tissue if they cough or sneeze, and staying home from work or school if they fall ill. It's not necessary to wear a surgical mask.</p>
<p>In addition to all this, people should avoid travelling to Mexico, the country hardest-hit by this swine flu outbreak. Late yesterday, the federal government signalled it would warn Canadians against non-essential trips to Mexico. The United States, the European Union, India and Malaysia had already issued travel advisories against non-vital travel to Mexico earlier in the day. Health officials in Waterloo Region are urging anyone who was in Mexico in the past week and feels sick to contact a doctor.</p>
<p>While individuals can do much to protect themselves, governments have a huge responsibility in confronting this public health emergency. Ontarians will hope that their provincial government has learned the lessons of the 2003 outbreak of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) that killed 44 people in the province.</p>
<p>A commission into the SARS outbreak concluded that the first wave of infections starting in March 2003 was unavoidable but likely could have been controlled more quickly if systems of public health and disease surveillance had been in better shape. The commission also found that the devastating second phase of the SARS infections could have been caught sooner. So how much better is the province prepared for an epidemic?</p>
<p>Yesterday, Elizabeth Witmer, MPP for Kitchener-Waterloo and Conservative health critic, criticized the provincial government because 13 of 36 local health units still lack pandemic plans. While highlighted in the auditor general's 2007 report, this shortcoming has not been addressed. (Waterloo Region does have a plan in place.) Meanwhile, the New Democrats accused the province of being unable to communicate properly with the public, citing the government's performance in the Listeria outbreak last summer that killed 21 people nationwide, most in Ontario.</p>
<p>To be sure, the opposition politicians are trying to score political points. In the coming days, the federal, provincial and municipal governments can reassure the public and show they have the matter well under control by effectively communicating their strategies for containing and controlling swine flu in Canada.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>The family of a Toronto woman on life-support in a Mexican hospital say that they believe she's being blocked from returning to Canada because of false fears over swine flu.</p>
<p>Victoria George, 29, has been in a Cancun hospital since Wednesday after suffering a severe asthma attack that sent her into cardiac arrest. She was vacationing with her husband and their son.</p>
<p>Her prognosis is grim and loved-ones want her flown back to Ontario to say their goodbyes, efforts that relatives claim have been repeatedly denied because of the swine flu outbreak in Mexico.</p>
<p>George's husband, Dylan Pazzano, said he was initially told there were no intensive-care unit beds at hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area. However, Pazzano said the family later received assurances that there was no shortage of space at hospitals in and around Toronto.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, he had not received any update on why his wife could not return to Canada.</p>

<p>TORONTO</p>
<p>Ontario residents should have confidence in the province's ability to respond to a possible swine flu pandemic because of what it learned from the deadly SARS outbreak in 2003, health officials and the Liberal government said yesterday.</p>
<p>However, the opposition parties said Ontario had not acted on the lessons learned from SARS and was ill-prepared for any similar disease outbreak.</p>
<p>There were a total of six cases of swine flu in British Columbia and Nova Scotia yesterday, but no confirmed cases in Ontario, said Dr. David Williams, the province's acting chief medical officer of health. Between 10 and 12 suspected cases are under investigation in Ontario, he said.</p>
<p>An public health information system created after SARS means health officials are no longer "using sticky notes on the wall'' to relay patient information, he said.</p>
<p>"That helped us with our listeriosis outbreak and is helping in this case as well so we have up-to-date, current information,'' Williams said. "We're way ahead of where we were with SARS, and of course we'll be using this as a good exercise to test the systems.''</p>
<p>Health Minister David Caplan said the province is better prepared for patients with swine flu because of its 2003 experience.</p>
<p>"Our ability to be able to respond, to identify, to contain and to be able to control these kinds of situations is increased because of our understanding of what happened during SARS," he said.</p>
<p>Opposition parties said Ontario is not ready for any pandemic because some local health units still don't have a pandemic plan.</p>
<p>"It was quite shocking personally, particularly when it was pointed out in the auditor general's 2007 report, that one-third of the units did not have a local plan in place,'' said Conservative health critic Elizabeth Witmer.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>No pandemic yet, but alert raised; World Health Organization says there is uncertainty how much the swine flu virus will spread</b>
</div><div>Helen Branswell   </div>
<div>The Canadian Press</div>
<div>964 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Waterloo Region Record</div><div>TKWR</div><div>Final</div><div>A8</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Kitchener-Waterloo Record.   </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said yesterday it still does not characterize a swine flu pandemic as inevitable but raised its pandemic alert level to signal the increasing severity of the situation.</p>
<p>It also urged countries not to close borders or impose travel bans, saying such measures would be unlikely to stop the spread of the virus and would cause economic harm.</p>
<p>But a number of countries had already taken actions, urging their citizens to avoid non-essential travel to places in the world where infections have been found. Canada, one of the affected countries, signalled it would warn Canadians against non-essential travel to Mexico, the country hardest hit by the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>It had been thought the WHO might raise the pandemic alert to Phase 5 from Phase 3, a position it has been at for years due to sporadic human infections with the avian influenza virus H5N1. But instead it took the more cautious approach of going to Phase 4.</p>
<p>The WHO's acting assistant director-general for health security and environment said experts on an emergency committee advising Director General Dr. Margaret Chan felt that while the world had taken significant steps toward the first pandemic since the Hong Kong flu in 1968, it's not there yet.</p>
<p>Further, Dr. Keiji Fukuda said, it may not get there with this unusual swine flu virus.</p>
<p>"A pandemic is not considered inevitable at this time,'' Fukuda said in a late evening news conference in Geneva.</p>
<p>The committee concluded there is definitely person-to-person spread of the virus, but felt it wanted more information about how capable the virus is at continuing to spread through generations of human hosts.</p>
<p>If the WHO saw a widespread community outbreak, he said, the committee would be reconvened and a decision likely made to go to Phase 5. Phase 6 is a pandemic.</p>
<p>"It's fair to say that the move from Phase 3 to Phase 4 signifies that we have taken a significant step closer but . . . we are not there yet,'' said Fukuda, a leading influenza expert.</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are notoriously unpredictable. When asked about how the outbreak might evolve, Fukuda painted a picture containing a surprisingly wide range of options, given how quickly this outbreak has unfolded.</p>
<p>"It is possible that as the situation evolves over the next few days, it could evolve to the point where it appears that we have moved into Phase 5. And it is also possible that the disease situation could be quieter and we could move backwards to Phase 3.''</p>
<p>"I think right now it's a little bit difficult to give you likelihoods. But it does reflect the fluidity of the situation.''</p>
<p>Fukuda said the WHO does not view closing borders or issuing travel bans as helpful. Studies show it would take an extreme cuts in international air travel to even slightly slow spread, he said, but taking that approach would harm people in economically. ways.</p>
<p>He said the WHO believes containment is not an option, given the range of disease spread -- effectively dismissing a long-standing WHO plan to try to stop an emerging pandemic at source.</p>
<p>Instead countries should focus efforts on steps that would mitigate the impact of a pandemic, Fukuda said.</p>
<p>One such step is the development of pandemic vaccine to protect against these swine flu viruses. The WHO decided that for now it would not tell manufacturers to abandon production of next winter's flu shots in favour of making a swine flu vaccine. But he said serious discussions are underway to flesh out options for making vaccine.</p>
<p>Canada is in talks with vaccine makers, including <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline</span>, which holds the country's pandemic vaccine control.</p>
<p>Speaking before the WHO news conference, Canada's chief public health officer said the WHO's decision doesn't change the situation on the ground in Canada.</p>
<p>"It does not change our preparations, it does not change our response,'' Dr. David Butler-Jones said in a news conference.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canada would be issuing a travel advisory warning against non-essential travel to Mexico, but would not block entry of migrant seasonal workers from Mexico who come to Canada for agricultural work.</p>
<p>THE LATEST SWINE FLU DEVELOPMENTS:</p>
<p>Death toll: 149, most of them suspected cases, all in Mexico.</p>
<p>Confirmed cases in Canada: Six (four in Nova Scotia, two in B.C.)</p>
<p>Mexico cases: 1,995 suspected and confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Confirmed cases elsewhere: 42 in U.S. (28 at a New York City school); one in Spain, two in Scotland.</p>
<p>Latest developments:</p>
<p>All schools in Mexico suspended until May 6. In Mexico City, surgical masks given to the public, venues closed and public events cancelled. World Bank loaning Mexico more than $200 million.</p>
<p>India and Malaysia urge citizens to avoid non-essential travel to Canada; Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan cautions other countries against "premature'' travel advisories.</p>
<p>Symptoms: Fever, lethargy, lack of appetite and coughing; some report runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Transmission: Believed to occur through coughing or sneezing, or touching contaminated surfaces before touching mouth or nose.</p>
<p>Misnomers: The biggest is the role of pork -- the CDC says people cannot get the flu by eating pork or pork products.</p>
<p>Advice: Health officials urge those with flu-like symptoms to avoid work or school, wash hands, cough into sleeves and get medical attention.</p>

<p>WATERLOO REGION</p>
<p>If you were in Mexico in the last week and feel sick, contact your doctor.</p>
<p>Physicians are on the lookout for local cases of swine flu, linked to a Mexican outbreak that killed more than 100 there.</p>
<p>"We have increased our vigilance," said Dr. Hsiu-Li Wang, associate medical officer of health for Waterloo Region. "We have asked our community physicians to be on the lookout."</p>
<p>Ontario hasn't reported a case of the illness. Six mild cases are reported in Canada and almost 50 in the U.S.</p>
<p>Wang described symptoms as fever, chills, cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches and pains, and extreme tiredness.</p>
<p>World health authorities have declared the outbreak a public health emergency and are monitoring its spread.</p>
<p>The U.S. is advising residents against non-essential travel to Mexico but Canada has not done the same. It's not known how many local residents recently travelled to Mexico. Flights to Mexico from the local airport ended last month.</p>
<p>It's estimated almost 21,000 residents travelled to three major Mexican destinations in 2005, a survey found.</p>
<p>This is an average of 400 trips per week but most trips would have been in December to March.</p>
<p>Residents without links to Mexico are asked to take standard precautions to protect themselves and others from the flu. This means: Wash your hands often, sneeze into the crook of your elbow, and stay home if ill.</p>
<p>Surgical masks are not recommended. Health officials say it's not feasible to wear them constantly, they can contaminate hands and surfaces when removed, and they provide a false sense of security.</p>
<p>If the worst happens and this swine flu outbreak turns into a global health disaster, the public health department has a plan to cope.</p>
<p>The Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Plan is 399 pages long.</p>
<p>The plan has not been activated but is in place to guide us through awful times.</p>
<p>A pandemic happens when a new flu strain spreads quickly around the world and sickens people who are not immune to it.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang said it's too early to tell if this outbreak will cause a pandemic. If a pandemic strikes this region, it's predicted it would:</p>
<p>Kill 300 to 700 people.</p>
<p>Put up to 2,500 people in hospital.</p>
<p>Sicken up to 129,000 people who might require outpatient care.</p>
<p>These estimates are for a population nine per cent smaller than today.</p>
<p>The emergency plan covers everything from medical response to mass immunization to maintaining local services and "planning for a surge in natural deaths."</p>
<p>A tool kit has been prepared to help local businesses cope, when up to 35 per cent of their employees could be off sick or dying.</p>
<p>The emergency flu plan is online at www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca[http://www.waterlooregionpandemic.ca].</p>
<p>If it sounds far-fetched, remember there were three pandemics in the last century that killed tens of millions here and abroad.</p>
<p>The worst in 1918 was called the Spanish Flu.</p>
<p>Public health experts have warned another pandemic is overdue.</p>

<p>The Canadian Tour is cutting short its swing through Mexico because of the swine flu outbreak.</p>
<p>The developmental circuit said late yesterday it's postponing the Yucatan Country Club Classic and Iberostar Riviera Maya Open in May as a "precaution." The events will be rescheduled later in the season.</p>
<p>The Yucatan was to begin May 7, the Iberostar the following Thursday. They were to be the third and final stop, respectively, of the tour's annual trek through Mexico.</p>
<p>The second tournament, the San Luis Potosi Open, is still on and is to begin Thursday. However, between 10 and 15 golfers have already withdrawn amid the country's growing health crisis.</p>
<p>Commissioner Richard Janes said the tour will "take every precaution" to protect its players this week, including barring spectators and local caddies from the La Loma Golf Club, which is in San Luis Potosi, about 350 kilometres north of Mexico City.</p>

<p>The number of people infected with the swine flu virus in Canada climbed to 13 today, after health officials in Alberta, Ontario and British Columbia confirmed new cases in their provinces.</p>
<p>In Ontario, health officials said there are now four cases. All of the individuals are from the Toronto area and had recently travelled to Mexico. They are recovering at home.</p>
<p>In Alberta, two cases were confirmed. Each otherwise healthy man - one from Calgary and another from the northern Alberta - suffered a mild form of the illness similar to other instances reported in Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>Neither individual required hospitalization, Dr. André Corriveau, Alberta's chief medical officer of health, told reporters today.</p>
<p>A provincial lab confirmed the results late Monday night. Symptoms became apparent a few days after each man returned to Canada.</p>
<p>"There really is no part of Mexico where you can say is free of disease," Dr. Corriveau said.</p>
<p>The Calgary man has shaken off most of his symptoms. The northern Alberta man has already recovered from the virus. His community is not being identified in order to protect privacy and quell alarm, according to officials. Their ages are also being kept confidential.</p>
<p>British Columbia confirmed a new case today, bringing the number of people infected in that province to three. There are another four cases in Nova Scotia. Health officials say all are recovering or have since recovered.</p>
<p>Dr. Corriveau said Alberta remains on "high alert" for more cases, but since the province is at the tail end of the regular flu season, there's still a lot of "background noise" in the health care system.</p>
<p>Still, he said he expects more cases to come to light, but said the level of concern for ordinary Albertans should remain close to "zero."</p>
<p>Earlier today, the World Health Organization said that the evolution of the swine flu outbreak into a global pandemic is not necessarily inevitable, but countries should prepare for the worst. The virus has crossed new borders and countries have started advising against travel to Mexico, the epicentre of the disease.</p>
<p>Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's acting assistant director-general for health security and environment, told reporters in a call from Geneva that the situation is becoming more serious. The current outbreak could be a mild pandemic, but he warned that the 1918 Spanish flu, which killed millions, started mildly.</p>
<p>"We really are in a period where countries should take this opportunity to really prepare themselves for the possibility of a pandemic," Dr. Fukuda said.</p>
<p>WHO raised the alert level for the first time on Monday to Phase 4, meaning there is sustained human-to-human transmission of a virus sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks.</p>
<p>The origins of the disease remain unclear, but there are reports that the town of La Gloria, Mexico, may be ground zero for the swine flu epidemic.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reports that more than 450 residents of La Gloria, a community of 3,000, say they're suffering from respiratory problems from contamination spread by pig waste at nearby breeding farms co-owned by U.S. company, <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods Inc</span>. Officials with the company say they've found no sign of swine flu on its farms, and Mexican authorities haven't determined the outbreak's origin.</p>
<p>As far back as late March, roughly one-sixth of the residents in the Gulf Coast state of Veracruz began complaining of respiratory infections that they say can be traced to a farm that lies upwind 8.5 kilometres to the north, in the town of Xaltepec. Granjas Carroll de Mexico, 50 per cent owned by Virginia-based Smithfield, has eight farms in the area.</p>
<p>The company said it is co-operating with Mexican officials in the investigation and will submit samples from its swine herd for testing at the University of Mexico.</p>
<p>"Based on available recent information, Smithfield has no reason to believe that the virus is in any way connected to its operations in Mexico. The company also noted that its joint ventures in Mexico routinely administer influenza virus vaccination to their swine herds and conduct monthly tests for the presence of swine influenza," the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>When asked about La Gloria, Dr. Fukuda said scientific teams are on the ground in Mexico and "it's too early right now to speculate about the origins."</p>
<p>In an effort to prevent the spread of the virus, Mexico City Interior Secretary Jose Angel Avila ordered all restaurant in Mexico City to serve only takeout food, and prohibited them from serving customers inside their establishments. He said today the measure is meant to prevent people from gathering in close proximity and spreading a virus that has already killed 152 people across Mexico</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mexico City Mayor Marcelo Ebrard is ordering gyms, sports clubs, swimming pools and pool halls closed -- extending a growing shutdown that already included schools and other public places.</p>
<p>The virus first came to light on April 17, when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that they had cases with the new strain. Doctors are at a loss to explain why cases outside of Mexico have not been as serious.</p>
<p>But they stress that the future course of the virus is unpredictable.</p>
<p>Canada and the United States issued advisories Monday recommending against non-essential travel to Mexico. The British government did the same today.</p>
<p>"We are now advising against all but essential travel to Mexico. Routine consular and all visa services at the embassy in Mexico City have been suspended until further notice," the advisory from the British Foreign Office said.</p>
<p>It added: "British nationals resident in or visiting Mexico may wish to consider whether they should remain in Mexico at this time."</p>
<p>Dr. Fukuda said that while the WHO does not recommend closing borders or issuing travel bans, he understands countries may wish to take their own measures.</p>
<p>"From the international perspective, when we look at whether travel advisories may slow the spread of the infection, may slow the spread of the epidemic, we believe that at this time, these kinds of manoeuvres would not substantially help to do this," he said.</p>
<p>The key to mitigating the spread of the disease is the development of a vaccine, which Canada has already begun. Others involve advising citizens to stay home if sick, wash their hands and, at its most severe, close schools, restrict public gatherings and limit travel.</p>
<p>The new swine flu strain appears vulnerable to anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza if it is caught in its early stages. A number of countries were already planning for a pandemic, triggered by the avian flu in southeast Asia, and have started the process of creating a new vaccine for swine flu. The WHO said a vaccine could take as many as six months to develop.</p>
<p>At Toronto City Hall this morning, flanked by Mayor David Miller and top city officials, Medical Officer of Health David McKeown said swine flu has yet to hit here but warned that future cases are "very likely" because of the volume of travel within North America and the ease of transmission of influenza."</p>
<p>Mr. Miller said the city has "substantial doses" in reserve of anti-viral drugs known to be effective in dealing with the swine flu. The stockpile would be used for city and health care workers dealing with those infected by the swine flu.</p>
<p>Both the mayor and Dr. McKeown repeatedly emphasized the need to take what Mr. Miller called "normal health precautions" to fend off the flu, including regular hand washing and sneezing into a sleeve to prevent airborne germs.</p>
<p>Dr. McKeown said anyone who has returned from an area affected by the swine flu outbreak, and who has symptoms, should contact a doctor or health care provider.</p>

</p>
<p>Pork producers and hog farmers around the world say they are being sideswiped by the swine flu outbreak and many want the name of the disease changed to “North American flu.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, roughly a dozen countries joined Russia and China in banning imports of pork products from parts of the United States, Mexico and elsewhere. South Korea and Ukraine have banned all pork and live hogs from North America, and Indonesia is destroying products already brought in.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, hog prices have fallen steadily since Monday and the share price of food giants <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods Inc</span>.,Tyson Foods Inc.and Maple Leaf Foods Inc.dropped as much as 12 per cent Monday before recovering somewhat Tuesday.</p>
<p>While Canada has been spared the brunt of the trade action so far, many hog farmers here are worried consumers will stop eating pork. Canada exports about 1 million tonnes of pork products annually, mainly to the U.S. and Japan.</p>
<p>“It's obviously a concern, it's a big concern,” said Clare Schlegel a hog farmer near Kitchener, Ont. “We want accurate information out there.”</p>
<p>A variety of organizations including the Canadian Pork Council, American Meat Institute and World Organization for Animal Health, or OIE, have called on health officials to drop the “swine flu” name. They argue the pork industry is being unfairly linked to the illness.</p>
<p>“There are serous misunderstandings which the general public in countries around the world have acquired about the role of pork meat in the transfer of the virus, simply because it is being referred to as swine flu,” Canadian Pork Council President Jurgen Preugschas said in a letter Tuesday to federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>“It is not justified to name this disease swine influenza,” said Bernard Vallat, head of the Paris-based OIE. “In the past, many human influenza epidemics with animal origin have been named using their geographic name, e.g., Spanish influenza or Asiatic influenza, thus it would be logical to call the disease ‘North-American influenza'.”</p>
<p>So far, the World Health Organization has rejected the idea, saying Tuesday that it plans to stick with “swine flu.” But U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said he is considering using another name.</p>
<p>“This is not a food-borne crisis,” Mr. Vilsack said. “It's important to not refer to swine flu. It's important to convey the message that consuming pork will not cause this illness.”</p>
<p>European Union officials have suggested calling the disease “novel flu.”</p>
<p>Linda Smith, a spokeswoman for Toronto-based Maple Leaf, said the company has not seen a significant impact on sales, but it supports the name change “so there is no misunderstanding about the link to pork or animal health in Canada,” she said.</p>
<p>Health officials have said repeatedly said the virus cannot be caught by eating pork. Some are now saying it isn't even clear the illness originated in pigs, and contains a mix of avian, swine and human viral genes. “As regards to this virus, it should be called something else,” Anthony Fauci, a director at the U.S. National Institutes of Health told reporters.</p>
<p>Much of the Canadian pork industry was already in tough shape before the swine flu outbreak. Hog prices had fallen so steeply the federal government offered to pay farmers $50-million last year to slaughter as many as 150,000 breeding swine. That program and a falling Canadian dollar have helped, but most farmers are still operating at a loss because of the high price of corn and soy meal, which are used in feed. Feed accounts for about 60 per cent of production costs.</p>
<p>The typical break-even point for hog farmers is about $1.60 per kilogram. Prices have been hovering around $1.30 per kg.</p>

<p>On the last day of his Mexican vacation, Richmond resident Ryan Windsor was tired and light-headed, and thought he had heatstroke.</p>
<p>On the plane home the next day, "I was freezing cold. I was wrapped in two blankets and flight attendants gave me hot chocolate and hot water bottles."</p>
<p>On the weekend, the 26-year-old learned he's one of two British Columbians with a confirmed case of swine flu, an illness Mexican authorities believe has caused more than 100 deaths in that country during an outbreak that was reported last week.</p>
<p>"How's that for my odds?" Windsor said from his home on Monday, during his last day of quarantine. "Why couldn't I win the lottery?"</p>
<p>Windsor said he flew to Cancun on April 14 with a friend, and enjoyed the sunshine and beach vacation he had anticipated, but began feeling sick before his return flight last Wednesday.</p>
<p>When he got home, he spent the next two days bedridden with all the symptoms of the common flu, only magnified. He also had trouble breathing.</p>
<p>He described swine flu as like the worse case of food poisoning imaginable, but lasting four days instead of 24 hours.</p>
<p>"It's the sickest I've been," he said.</p>
<p>By Friday morning, with his symptoms persisting, Windsor was quarantined in Richmond Hospital for testing. Blood was drawn and chest X-rays were taken. He was sent home the same day and told to stay there and wear a mask.</p>
<p>He said hospital staff initially told him it was unlikely he had swine flu because he had not visited a location they thought was a danger area, such as Mexico City.</p>
<p>But the following day, the hospital told him he had tested positive for an as-yet unidentified subtype of influenza A, a flu strain rarely found in humans and normally found in birds and some mammals like pigs.</p>
<p>More test samples were taken Saturday and sent to Vancouver General Hospital, he said.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Windsor said, he received a call from the B.C. Centre for Disease Control confirming he had swine flu, after his blood was sent to California for testing.</p>
<p>"I thought they were really good," Windsor said of the medical staff handling his illness.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization said Monday there were 73 confirmed cases of swine flu worldwide, although hundreds, if not thousands more cases are suspected due to the outbreak that has also affected the southern United States.</p>
<p>The UN body also raised its alert level on the outbreak to Level 4, meaning the virus is spreading between humans.</p>
<p>Windsor said he couldn't pinpoint where he picked up the virus, but said it could have been a nightclub.</p>

</p>
<p>Amid the uncertainty over whether this swine flu outbreak will expand from a serious Mexican epidemic into the global pandemic long expected by public health authorities, one thing is certain.</p>
<p>As events unfold, the public will know more about the viral disease, its progress through human populations, what authorities are doing in response and what individual citizens can do for themselves, their families and their neighbours than at any time in human history.</p>
<p>This can be both a blessing and a curse.</p>
<p>A blessing because knowledge is power and planetary communications systems make it possible for medical experts and those responsible for public health to share and disseminate information more quickly and far more widely.</p>
<p>A curse because too much information arriving too quickly without adequate time for placing events in context can amplify public anxiety and, in the worst cases, create panic where instead there should be informed concern, prudent preparation and precaution.</p>
<p>For example, without diminishing the seriousness of a global influenza pandemic in medical terms or the fact that every pandemic results in some tragic outcomes for thousands, even millions, of individuals and their families, it's important to put those numbers into context.</p>
<p>The media, with their urge to simplify and to focus on immediate events, tend to aggregate raw numbers and to concentrate upon them as a measure of the seriousness and magnitude of the event being covered.</p>
<p>Thus we hear constant updates on the number of fatalities from multiple media platforms -- newspapers, radio, 24-hour TV news channels that update every hour, websites and bloggers who range from the highly informed to those who are already linking the current events to sunspot activity or suggesting it's an engineered virus released from germ warfare labs.</p>
<p>"Eighty-one dead in Mexico; U.S. declares emergency," read one of the headlines Sunday. Yes, 81 dead in Mexico is something to grieve and is cause for public concern. Each one of those dead represents the anguish of a family. Yet, as the aphorism goes, one death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic. It's confusing the statistic for the tragedy that exaggerates fear.</p>
<p>We seldom hear daily updates on the numbers of those infected who have recovered, for example. Yet consider the much-cited Spanish influenza pandemic of 1918. It's common for commentary to cite infection rates and total associated fatalities.</p>
<p>It's estimated that about 28 per cent of Canadians and Americans contracted the Spanish flu. Worldwide, an estimated 2.5 per cent of the sick died of complications, which made the pandemic one of the most lethal flu outbreaks in recorded history. Certainly it was one that imprinted itself upon human consciousness for several generations.</p>
<p>But there's another way to look at those statistics. You might observe, for example, that they mean that even during the worst ravages of the 1918 flu, 97.5 per cent of those infected survived and recovered. Or that 72 per cent of the population -- even in the absence of the sophisticated public health planning and infrastructure that Canada and the U.S. have since built -- was not infected during the pandemic.</p>
<p>So, even if we had a repeat of the 1918 flu, the chances were seven out of 10 that you wouldn't catch it and if you did, the odds were better than nine out of 10 that you'd survive.</p>
<p>That was during the worst pandemic of the modern era and one which occurred in the days before the instantaneous communications of radio, television and the Web enabled quick public health responses.</p>

<p>As six B.C. residents await results of Mexican swine flu testing, public health officials are strategizing how to urgently distribute antiviral treatments now stockpiled in a secret, secure location should a pandemic occur.</p>
<p>The drugs (Tamiflu and Relenza) are effective only if taken in the first 48 hours of symptom onset. Neither are meant to be used to prevent influenza.</p>
<p>The six unidentified B.C. residents are in addition to the two confirmed cases in men who contracted the illness while vacationing in Mexico. In both confirmed cases, symptoms were relatively mild and full recoveries are expected.</p>
<p>Authorities were not releasing any names, but 26-year-old Richmond resident Ryan Windsor told The Sun the illness he suffered on his return from Mexico has been confirmed as swine flu.</p>
<p>The other patient with a confirmed diagnosis is believed to have visited a clinic in the Fraser region.</p>
<p>In both cases, doctors noted on the laboratory requisition forms that patients had travelled to Mexico, which alerted provincial laboratory technologists that swine flu might be a possibility. Now there are a handful of other possible cases among people who have returned from Mexico, but lab results are not expected to confirm or rule out swine flu for at least another day.</p>
<p>Dr. David Patrick, director of epidemiology of the B.C. Centre for Disease Control, said the Ministry of Health monitors influenza activity by looking at doctors' billing codes for treatment of respiratory symptoms. If they go way up, the centre is alerted about the surge.</p>
<p>None of the six residents who may also have the swine flu are contacts of the first two cases, say public health officials. That means there is no evidence yet of community transmission.</p>
<p>Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer for Vancouver Coastal Health, said in addition to what pharmacies have on hand, there is enough antiviral treatment stockpiled in B.C. to treat 700,000 residents, and officials are now planning how to distribute those pills should it be necessary.</p>
<p>In the laboratory, she said, the swine flu strain has been shown to be sensitive to Tamiflu "but we don't yet know if it is clinically effective."</p>
<p>Experts say there is no evidence anyone who didn't get a flu shot last fall should now rush out to get one because the swine flu is a new virus and there is no evidence the flu vaccine will prevent it or mitigate symptoms.</p>
<p>"We aren't even recommending people who are going to Mexico get it," Daly said.</p>
<p>B.C. public health experts are demonstrating a calm demeanour to avoid panicking the public.</p>
<p>"We have to put the risk into context, since the illness has been mild in returning travellers. Certainly there are other risks to travelling to Mexico, like hepatitis A or motor vehicle crashes," Daly said.</p>
<p>In hospitals, doctors are being advised to handle suspected cases of severe swine flu as they would other potentially contagious patients.</p>
<p>Patrick said now is the time to reinforce precautionary measures. "That includes handwashing, staying home for about a week if one has a cough or fever and encouraging others to stay home from work or school if they exhibit symptoms of illness."</p>

<p>Given that some virologists have said we're due for a major pandemic, the appearance of a new strain of swine flu virus has understandably caused considerable concern among the public and public health experts.</p>
<p>But while there are disturbing aspects to the latest outbreak, we do know a good deal about how to prevent transmission, and we are in possession of antiviral drugs that are effective in treating the illness.</p>
<p>The disturbing aspects are most evident in Mexico: As of Monday afternoon, Mexican authorities said some 2,000 people have been infected, and up to 149 have died.</p>
<p>Of particular concern is that young, previously healthy adults seem to be succumbing to the virus, a phenomenon that was also observed in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic. This is odd, since infants, the elderly and people with compromised immune systems are usually most seriously affected by such viruses.</p>
<p>Some researchers suggest that infection might trigger an aggressive immune system response that destroys lung tissue, and hence those with strong immune systems could be most at risk. But at this point, we just don't know.</p>
<p>We also don't know why it is the illness has claimed many Mexicans, but has proven to be relatively mild in infected Canadians and Americans. Experts have suggested that the virus might live longer in Mexico, but again, we don't know.</p>
<p>These unanswered questions, and the potential for a worldwide pandemic, do make the virus worrisome. And some people grew even more worried when the United States issued a public health emergency.</p>
<p>But such alerts shouldn't be worrying because they're designed to free up health care resources and the U.S. government's stockpile of antiviral medications, should they be needed.</p>
<p>Canada is also conducting surveillance, and has a significant stockpile of drugs for use in an outbreak. So a declaration of a public health emergency simply allows health care workers to do what they need to do to contain the illness.</p>
<p>And while their work is essential, individuals, as always, still possess the most effective means to prevent transmission of the virus.</p>
<p>We know that about 80 per cent of common infectious diseases like the flu are spread through people's hands. This means that proper handwashing, with soap and warm water, is the single most effective way to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.</p>
<p>People should also avoid touching their eyes, mouth and nose, since many germs are spread that way. And blowing your nose into a tissue and throwing the tissue away is effective in preventing transmission of germs to others.</p>
<p>If you do feel ill -- particularly if you've recently visited an infected area such as Mexico -- then you should stay home to avoid infecting others. This goes for any illness, not just swine flu.</p>
<p>And if you have symptoms of the flu -- fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, coughing and sore throat are most common -- then you might want to visit your doctor, since early treatment is most effective.</p>
<p>In other words, we really need to treat the swine flu much like any other communicable disease. It might appear scary, but it's no match for good hygiene and common sense.</p>
<p>Poll question: Will you isolate yourself at home if you have any of the symptoms of influenza? Answer Yes or No at vancouversun.com/opinion</p>
<p>In response to Saturday's poll question -- Do you plan to vote in the May 12 provincial election? -- the vast majority of you, 85.29 per cent, said Yes, while 14.71 per cent said No.</p>

</p>
<p>Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said his players could beat "everybody" when they were at their best as he urged them to be fearless against Manchester United in tomorrow's first leg of the Champions League semifinal at Old Trafford.</p>
<p>The Gunners head into that match unbeaten in 20 games after Cesc Fabregas's pair - his first goals in six months - secured a 2-0 Premier League victory at home to relegation-threatened Middlesbrough here on Sunday.</p>
<p>The only concern for Wenger was a back injury to former United defender Mikael Silvestre, who is rated "50-50" for the game in Manchester.</p>
<p>Arsenal's hopes of catching Chelsea and earning an automatic Champions League place next season remain alive and Wenger will prepare for the crunch match with United confident of again upsetting rival manager Sir Alex Ferguson.</p>
<p>The Scot, whose team is looking to retain its English and European titles, will know exactly what he's up against after sitting in the stands of the Emirates Stadium to witness Arsenal's fifth successive home win.</p>
<p>"It's important that we are at our best on Wednesday night," Wenger said, "because when we are at our best, we can beat everybody.</p>
<p>"If you go to Old Trafford without belief, you make it very difficult from the start.</p>
<p>"We will go there with belief, desire and enjoyment because we enjoy to be where we are.</p>
<p>"Sir Alex knows us and what he will think is that it will be an exciting game between two teams who like to play.</p>
<p>"We know each other well, but the talent on the pitch always surprises you. I believe that both teams will go for it. We will be faithful to the game we play and everywhere we go in Europe we try to win the game.</p>
<p>"If we play at our best, we have a good chance, we can do it.</p>
<p>"Sir Alex was here? I thought he was coming to watch Middlesbrough!</p>
<p>"But we do have good red wine here in the directors' box, so that was maybe why he came to watch us," Wenger joked.</p>
<p>Bayern clips Klinsmann:</p>
<p>Jurgen Klinsmann, 44, was sacked as head coach of Bayern Munich yesterday after a series of poor results, the defending Bundesliga champion said.</p>
<p>Recent defeats have seen Bayern crash out of the Champions League, while Saturday's 1-0 loss to Schalke leaves the team third in the league. Former Bayern trainer Jupp Heynckes will take over as head coach for the remaining five league games.</p>
<p>U-17 swine-flu cancellations:</p>
<p>North American junior football championship matches scheduled this week in Tijuana have been cancelled after a Mexican outbreak of swine flu, CONCACAF said.</p>
<p>Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica and the United States had already qualified for the four regional berths in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup later this year in Nigeria. Semifinals and final matches to decide seeds were called off.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Another 1918? Maybe, maybe not; As yet, we don't have the crucial numbers to tell</b>
</div><div>SHARON KIRKEY   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>963 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A4</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>Ominous similarities exist between the swine flu and the 1918 pandemic virus that killed millions around the globe, from a shared "death profile" of 20- to 40-year-olds to an ability to spread rapidly among humans, experts say.</p>
<p>Some warn the swine flu outbreak has all the hallmarks of a pandemic. Others say it might be no worse than normal flu.</p>
<p>"The bottom line is, we really don't know," said Brian Ward, associate director of the Research Institute of McGill University Health Centre.</p>
<p>Experts don't know because important numbers are still missing. No one knows how prevalent the illness is. There could be millions of infected people in Mexico, with only the most severe cases ending up in a clinic or hospital, meaning what we're seeing is only the severe end of the spectrum.</p>
<p>"If it's 80 deaths on a background of 2,000 cases, that's really, really bad," Ward said. "If it's 80 deaths and 1,300 hospitalized on a background of 10 million, it's still perhaps worse than the seasonal flu and a funny pattern. But it's not the same kind of hair-raising scenarios that the former numbers would lead you to believe.</p>
<p>"The reality check is, there are lots of ways to get sick and die in developing world countries," he said. "The last two weeks have given us another one."</p>
<p>Health authorities have been fearing an outbreak of H5N1 bird flu for years, and the only reason they haven't pressed the panic button is that H5N1 has never shown the ability to pass easily from human to human, Ward says.</p>
<p>The virus in Mexico, and now other places, "clearly has that capacity," meaning it has much greater pandemic potential than bird flu.</p>
<p>Swine flu normally spreads from pig to pig. Occasionally it will spread from pig to human. "This particular version has mutated so that it's able to transmit from person to person," said James Scott, a professor at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health and an expert in the airborne movement of germs.</p>
<p>He says the virus is the same type as the 1918 strain.</p>
<p>As well, the Spanish flu emerged in the U.S. in Kansas and Queen's, N.Y., "and that's exactly the same thing that happened here," Scott said. "I'm not a superstitious guy, but it's utterly weird." The epidemiology, he says, "for sure matches up with something you really want to worry about."</p>
<p>But he says that worry should be tempered. We're on the cusp of flu season. Flu typically doesn't spread very well when the amount of moisture in the air increases. The fact we're heading into a more humid time of year, "means that we aren't likely to see a great number of cases or the kind of conditions that would make this thing spread like wildfire over the summer," Scott said.</p>
<p>But there's another caveat: The Spanish flu that killed tens of millions of people emerged in early March of 1918, and didn't quiet down over the summer the way most flu outbreaks do.</p>
<p>The outbreak hit hard in Montreal: On the worst day, 201 deaths were reported.</p>
<p>Influenza affects millions of Canadians each year, resulting in 20,000 admissions to hospital, on average, and 4,000 deaths. Normally, fewer than 0.1 per cent of people with influenza die, if they have no underlying medical conditions.</p>
<p>But the swine flu appears more contagious than garden-variety flu bugs.</p>
<p>"What I do is a body count. When people die, you really start to pay attention," said University of Ottawa virologist Earl Brown. "And these people are getting atypical pneumonia - very severe lung infections. That's the thing you worry about."</p>
<p>But the virus is also cropping up among travellers in other continents, and almost all of them are mild cases. "They're not even typical influenza," Brown said. "In the Middle Ages they called it knock-me-down fever. Especially the first time you get it when you're a kid, you're in bed for a week. You're hit very hard and you're very sick.</p>
<p>"But they've got kids out in Nova Scotia saying: 'I didn't know I was sick.' "</p>
<p>The U.S., cases are almost identical to the Mexican strain. "They have the same set of genes, they just have a few changes in them," Brown said.</p>
<p>"Is that important? Is the virus evolving as we're sitting here talking? Is it changing as it's going through people?" asked Brown, who studies the evolution of virulence in influenza viruses.</p>
<p>And there's the rub: Not enough is known about the epidemiology of the swine flu in Mexico to predict how it will unfold globally. How many people have been infected? Who got sick? Did the hardest hit get "super infected," meaning infected with the flu along with another circulating pathogen or bacterium?</p>
<p>Is there something about their genes or environment that is making Mexicans infected with swine flu appear to be dying at a higher rate than normal with flu?</p>
<p>"We really don't have enough details," said Mark Loeb, an infectious disease specialist at McMaster University in Hamilton. "But what is apparent is that this virus is spreading rapidly."</p>
<p>And that makes containment less likely.</p>
<p>"Which means I think we should be anticipating widespread dissemination of this virus," Loeb said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Worst is yet to come, Canadian officials warn; Pandemic alert raised; Three infections suspected in Quebec</b>
</div><div>ANDREW MAYEDA and MEAGAN FITZPATRICK   </div>
<div>Canwest News Service</div>
<div>926 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level yesterday amid a battle against the swine flu outbreak, while Canadian health officials warned to expect more cases and probably some deaths in Canada.</p>
<p>As cases were confirmed for the first time in Spain and Scotland, the WHO raised its pandemic alert phase from three to four on a scale of one to six.</p>
<p>It's the first time the pandemic alert has attained that level since the world health agency created the system in 2005.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, WHO officials cautioned a flu pandemic is not "inevitable."</p>
<p>"What this can really be interpreted as is a significant step towards pandemic influenza, but also it is a phase which says that we are not there yet. In other words, at this time we think we have taken a step in that direction, but a pandemic is not considered inevitable at this time," said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of health security at the WHO.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of confirmed cases remained at six yesterday: four in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia. There are three suspected cases in Quebec, according to the Quebec Health Department - two in Montreal and one in Mauricie.</p>
<p>"We have no new confirmed cases to date and all existing cases have recovered completely from their mild symptoms," said Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer.</p>
<p>Symptoms in the Canadian cases have been milder than those in Mexico, where as many as 149 deaths are suspected.</p>
<p>However, Canadian health officials warned the worst could be yet to come.</p>
<p>"Simply because we're seeing mild symptoms so far does not mean we can take this for granted. We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illnesses and we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well," Butler-Jones said.</p>
<p>"We hope not. But that is a normal part of an influenza outbreak of any type."</p>
<p>One of the first Canadians to catch the swine flu at first thought it was just a case of heat stroke.</p>
<p>Ryan, who lives in Richmond, B.C., became tired and light-headed on the last day of his vacation in Cancun.</p>
<p>When he got home, he spent the next two days bedridden with all the symptoms of the common flu, only worse. He also had trouble breathing.</p>
<p>He described swine flu as like four days of the worse case of food poisoning imaginable.</p>
<p>"It's the sickest I've been," he said.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canada has started implementing its national flu-pandemic plan, with officials stepping up surveillance for flu cases and government scientists rushing to develop a vaccine.</p>
<p>"I want to reassure Canadians that we will remain vigilant in our monitoring and surveillance," Aglukkaq said.</p>
<p>As the number of cases doubled in the U.S., Washington declared a public health emergency and warned Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert. But it is not a cause for alarm," President Barack Obama said.</p>
<p>But while Ottawa emphasized its efforts to co-ordinate plans with the U.S. and Mexico, Canadian officials were still weighing whether to follow the U.S. and issue a travel advisory against Mexico.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, countries such as India, Australia and Malaysia cautioned citizens against travelling to countries where cases have been confirmed, including Canada.</p>
<p>The moves drew a harsh rebuke from federal officials.</p>
<p>"Different countries apply their own approaches ... and one of the challenges is avoiding the knee-jerk reactions. One of the things you want to avoid is actually making problems worse," Butler-Jones said, adding he didn't understand why other countries had issued the warnings against Canada.</p>
<p>Public Safety Minister Peter Van Loan called the travel advisories against Canada an "overreaction."</p>
<p>"I think that countries should be prudent in only taking that step if there is clear evidence of a very real danger and risk," Van Loan told reporters.</p>
<p>In Mexico, where the outbreak is believed to have originated this month, officials continued to raise their estimate of the death toll. There are 20 confirmed deaths, and a suspected toll of 149.</p>
<p>More than 700 people are being treated in hospital for serious respiratory illnesses in Mexico and 1,070 have been discharged.</p>
<p>There are 40 confirmed cases in the U.S., all mild, in five states - New York, Ohio, Kansas, Texas and California.</p>
<p>In its briefing yesterday, the WHO said it's too late to try to contain the virus so countries should focus on mitigation measures. Those measures however, do not include closing borders or restricting travel to affected countries, the agency said.</p>
<p>On the WHO's alert scale, Level 6 is considered a pandemic. At Level 3, limited human-to-human transmission of the flu strain may occur, but the strain is not believed to be contagious enough to cause a pandemic. At Level 4, the strain has moved beyond causing outbreaks among small clusters of people to triggering "community-level outbreaks," thus increasing the risk of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Swine flu is common among pigs, but sometimes spreads to humans. Scientists are still researching the nature of the new strain.</p>

</p>
<p>Canadian stocks were hit hard Monday, as mounting fears of a major swine flu outbreak placed new doubts on an alreadyfragile global economy.</p>
<p>The S&P/TSX Composite Index lost 154.68 points, or 1.62%, to 9394.80, as losers outpaced gainers more than threeto- one and eight subindices ended the day in negative territory. It was the first losing session for Canada's main exchange since last Monday, when it fell more than 300 points. The <span class="companylink">TSX Venture Exchange</span> also snapped a winning streak, losing 3.83 points, or 0.38%, to 1002.98. Meanwhile, the Canadian dollar was down 67 basis points to US$0.82.</p>
<p>"Increased public awareness over the possibility of a major swine flu pandemic appears to have raised a number of concerns among investors," said Colin Cieszynski, market analyst at CMC Markets Canada.</p>
<p>"Trading [yesterday] seems to suggest that fears have increased that a major flu epidemic may keep people at home and impact business and leisure travel demand, consumer spending and demand for pork products. On the other hand, it also appears that a pandemic may increase demand for vaccines and medical diagnostic tools." In Toronto, the air travel industry was hit particularly hard, with <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. and Air Canada both down more than 5%, and tour operator <span class="companylink">Transat AT Inc</span>. down more than 10%.</p>
<p>Mr. Cieszynski added that commodities also took a hit as oil prices fell US$1.41 to US$50.14 a barrel, copper prices fell slightly and gold dropped US$6.20 to US$907.40 an ounce. As a result, energy and materials stocks were down 1.87% and 2.01%, respectively.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Maple Leaf Foods</span>, meanwhile, held up relatively well on the day, despite the obvious concerns surrounding pork products.</p>
<p>The food services company lost just $0.04 in mild trading, to close at $8.45.</p>
<p>In the U.S., the effect of the spreading swine flu on markets was less pronounced as investors turned their thoughts to some positive developments in the auto sector.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 51.29 points, or 0.64%, to 8025. The S&P 500 lost 8.72 points, or 1.01%, to 857.51 and the NASDAQ Composite Index closed at 1679.41, down 14.88 points or 0.88%.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>. rose 21% on its plan to cut liabilities and terminate the Pontiac brand.</p>
<p>Stocks affected by the flu concerns included <span class="companylink">Carnival Corp</span>. and <span class="companylink">Delta Airlines Inc</span>., both down 14%, and <span class="companylink">Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide Inc</span>., down 8.9%. On the upside, GlaxoSmith- Kline plc was one of several health-carerelated companies that advanced in New York yesterday.</p>

</div><div>REBECCA SMITH   </div>

<div>568 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Montreal Gazette</div><div>MTLG</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Montreal Gazette   </div>
</p>
<p>The outbreak of swine flu has led to a series of bewildering claims and counterclaims about how to avoid the disease. Here is the latest advice from experts.</p>
<p>What is swine flu?</p>
<p>It is a respiratory disease in pigs which does not normally infect humans. This strain has been found to also contain parts of bird flu viruses and human flu viruses.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms?</p>
<p>The same as normal seasonal flu: fever, cough, sore throat, aches, chills, fatigue and nausea. It spreads from person to person, probably in the same way as other flu viruses.</p>
<p>How can I prevent myself from catching it?</p>
<p>Wash your hands regularly and thoroughly. Avoid close contact with people who have got the disease. If you do fall ill and have recently travelled to a country where outbreaks have been reported, contact your doctor.</p>
<p>Do face masks really work?</p>
<p>Not really, and some experts say they give people a false sense of security and spread panic. Doctors wear face masks when examining suspected swine flu patients in order to avoid spreading the condition and these are disposed of immediately after use. Facemasks worn all day by the general public are unlikely to slow the spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Should we be taking Tamiflu?</p>
<p>No. Tamiflu and the other anti-viral drug, Relenza, work to ease the symptoms of flu once you have it. The drugs will not prevent you from contracting the disease.</p>
<p>Should we avoid eating pork?</p>
<p>No, the flu cannot be contracted through eating infected meat.</p>
<p>Should we avoid travelling to Mexico?</p>
<p>The EU health commissioner has advised against travel to Mexico and the U.S. unless on urgent matters. The Foreign and Commonwealth</p>
<p>Office has not warned against travel but has said that visitors should be aware of the flu outbreak there.</p>
<p>Will the flu shot I had in the winter protect me?</p>
<p>Unlikely. Although the swine flu is an H1N1 virus, analysis shows it is quite different from the H1N1 that can infect humans.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p>Graphic/Diagram: McCLATCHY TRIBUNE / Swine flu: Swine flu is a respiratory disease which infects pigs but also people, typically those who have been in contact with pigs.</p>
<p>Symptoms in humans: People-to-people transmission is through coughing, sneezing</p>
<p>The virus: Influenza A subtypes: H1N1, H1N2, H3N1, H3N2, H2N3</p>
<p>New “reassortant” virus Forms when genes from different viruses begin to mix</p>
<p>When flu spreads person-to-person, rather than from animals to humans, it can continue to mutate, making it harder to treat or fight off</p>
<p>Incubation time 5-10 days</p>
<p>There are no vaccines that contain current swine flu virus causing illness in humans</p>

<div id="hd"><b>A breath of fresh air at last; Passengers wear masks for entire five-hour flight from Mexico City</b>
</div><div>Alexandra Zabjek, With files from Kimberley Collins-Lauber   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>556 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Travellers from Mexico City stepped off a flight at Edmonton International Airport on Monday night with blue surgical masks looped around their necks as precautions against swine flu.</p>
<p>"The soldiers were on the streets distributing the masks, so we took them," said Francesca Lachance, who spent 11 days in Mexico City with her husband, Arthur.</p>
<p>On the last day of the trip, the couple found that many restaurants, museums, and churches were closed. They wore the masks for the entire five-hour flight home, and plan to quarantine themselves from their grandson and their pregnant daughter for at least two days.</p>
<p>Customs officials at Edmonton's airport were also wearing masks to greet the travellers from Mexico.</p>
<p>"It was on the news and the Mexican government is really concerned about it," said Alex Ewen, who cleared customs with a white mask hooked firmly behind his ears, two sombreros in his hands.</p>
<p>"I didn't want to get the swine flu, so I said, 'Let's put on the mask and do it.' "</p>
<p>Travel agents around the city were inundated with calls in the wake of fears about the swine flu outbreak in Mexico, but few people appeared to have cancelled their trips.</p>
<p>One reason could be that -- with a few exceptions -- refunds are not offered for cancelled trips, says one agent.</p>
<p>"When you consider that only six people in all of Canada have been affected, it really boils down to a personal decision," said Lesley Paull of Paull Travel. "When we had SARS, we still flew to Manitoba."</p>
<p>Air Canada and Mexicana will not issue refunds for travellers wishing to cancel or rebook flights to Mexico, unless they are flying to Mexico City in the next three days, she said. Most Canadians travel to resort areas rather than the capital, where most illness has been reported.</p>
<p>Paull said travel insurance will only cover cancellations if the government issues a travel advisory. Her agency has not seen any cancellations because of the swine flu.</p>
<p>Nor has AMA Travel Services, said Andrew Hopkyns, the director of business development. AMA has hundreds of travellers in Mexico and hundreds more leaving in the next few days. He said staff have been fielding calls from clients who are wondering if they should cancel.</p>
<p>"We have been swamped by many of our customers with questions about swine flu," he said.</p>
<p>Hopkyns advises would-be travellers not to change their plans if they are not leaving this week. If Health Canada issues a travel advisory, cancellation insurance will take effect.</p>
<p>A travel advisory on Air Canada's website says change fees will be waived for customers who were scheduled to fly to Mexico City on or before May 6, 2009, and would like to postpone their trip to a later date.</p>
<p>West Jet's website issued a statement that said until April 30, travellers can cancel or change, without charge, the airfare portion of their trips.</p>

</p>
<p>Currencies - A deadly outbreak of swine flu in Mexico has pulled the plug for now on a two-month rally in the peso, as investors worry the disease could scare tourists away and slow the country's already battered economy.</p>
<p>Mexico is one of the world's top vacation destinations and tourists visiting the country spent more than $13 billion US last year in foreign currency, helping the peso against the U. S. dollar.</p>
<p>But analysts fear a contagious virus that has killed more than 100 people in Mexico could lead tourists to cancel trips to popular beach resorts such as Cancun and Acapulco.</p>
<p>The peso rallied about 18 per cent in the seven weeks through to Thursday after sinking to around 15 per U. S. dollar last year.</p>
<p>That recent rally is likely dead for now, analysts said, as the peso finished down 5.1 per cent Monday at 14.05 to the greenback.</p>

</p>
<p>N ow that suspected cases of the deadly swine flu have spread around the globe, and the death toll has nearly doubled overnight, Mexican authorities owe the world an explanation.</p>
<p>When did they learn of the disease's appearance and why did they take so long to inform the outside world?</p>
<p>Mexican health officials first noted a huge spike in flu cases in late March. By mid-April, they began noticing young, otherwise healthy people were dying from the virus.</p>
<p>Yet, the public remained in the dark until Thursday, when U. S. health officials announced a possible swine flu outbreak. Only then did Mexican officials alert the public and begin closing schools and cancelling events.</p>
<p>This is reprehensible. Early detection and intervention save lives. The more information epidemiologists have, the better equipped they are to contain the disease, and even develop a vaccine.</p>
<p>Yet, senior officials with the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were still operating in the dark on the weekend, unable to determine even if the number of cases found daily in Mexico was growing. This is basic information that should be readily available because they indicate the spread of an epidemic.</p>
<p>Further, if caught early enough, the rare virus appears to be treatable with anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza, commonly stockpiled, including in Canada.</p>
<p>To his credit, Mexican President Felipe Calderon showed strong leadership on the weekend by obtaining emergency powers to address the crisis.</p>
<p>At the same time, the suspected death toll continues to climb, jumping from 81 on Sunday to 149 by Monday.</p>
<p>Now the World Health Organization has raised the alert level from three to four, in its six-point alert system.</p>
<p>Nothing Calderon does now can mitigate the country's initial delay in its response. It's unclear whether that lag time resulted in any significant consequences, but it reflects poorly on the country's reputation, particularly if the delay was a deliberate attempt to keep the information hidden.</p>
<p>As a popular tourist destination and a NAFTA partner, it was especially incumbent upon Mexico to sound the alarm as early as possible, although all countries have a duty to step up their monitoring and reporting to the World Health Organization.</p>
<p>In 2003, China treated its SARS outbreak as a state secret.</p>
<p>The lesson of SARS made it clear that inadequate surveillance and response in just one country endangers public health worldwide.</p>
<p>Public health must always come ahead of public relations.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>World flu threat raised; Travel warnings as world tries to thwart spread</b>
</div><div>Meagan Fitzpatrick   </div>
<div>Calgary Herald</div>
<div>977 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Calgary Herald</div><div>CALH</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Calgary Herald   </div>
</p>
<p>The World Health Organization raised its pandemic alert level a notch Monday amid a world-wide battle against the swine-flu outbreak, while Canadian health officials warned the public to expect more cases and some deaths here.</p>
<p>As cases were confirmed for the first time in Spain and Scotland, the WHO raised its pandemic alert from Phase 3 to Phase 4 on a scale of one to six.</p>
<p>It's the first time the pandemic alert has attained that level since the agency created the system in 2005.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, WHO officials cautioned a flu pandemic is not inevitable.</p>
<p>"What this can really be interpreted as is a significant step toward pandemic influenza, but also it is a phase which says that we are not there yet," said Keiji Fukuda, assistant director-general of health security at the WHO.</p>
<p>In Canada, the number of confirmed cases remained at six Monday: four in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Alberta's top doctor said the province is prepared, adding that no cases of swine flu have been confirmed here.</p>
<p>Albertans looking for information about the flu caused a big surge in calls to Health Link.</p>
<p>Symptoms in the Canadian cases have been milder than those in Mexico, where 20 deaths due to swine flu have been confirmed. Another 130 deaths are suspected of being caused by swine flu.</p>
<p>However, Canadian health officials warned the public the worst could be yet to come.</p>
<p>"Simply because we're seeing mild symptoms so far does not mean we can take this for granted. We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illnesses and we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well,"Canadian Chief Public Health Office David Butler-Jones told reporters in Ottawa.</p>
<p>Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canada is implementing its national flu pandemic plan, with officials stepping up surveillance for cases and government scientists rushing to develop a vaccine.</p>
<p>"I want to reassure Canadians that we will remain vigilant in our monitoring and surveillance, and will make informed decisions as events unfold," said Aglukkaq.</p>
<p>On Monday, Canadian officials started giving swine-flu alerts to travellers departing for or returning from Mexico.</p>
<p>As the number of cases doubled in the United States, Washington declared a public health emergency and warned Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>"This is obviously a cause for concern and requires a heightened state of alert. But it is not a cause for alarm," said President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>But while Ottawa emphasized its efforts to co-ordinate plans with the U. S. and Mexico, Canadian officials were still weighing whether to follow the United States and issue a travel advisory against Mexico.</p>
<p>Swine flu is common among pigs and is sometimes spread to humans. This current outbreak is notable because it is a strain of swine flu that has never been seen before, is spreading from human to human, and it is causing deaths in people aged 20 to 50, not the young and the elderly who typically are more susceptible to dying from a flu.</p>
<p>Concerns about swine flu spilled over into the world of business as markets tried to assess the threat.</p>
<p>Cautious traders pushed Canadian and U.S. stock prices lower. Toronto's main stock index fell 1.6 per cent, breaking a four-session rally, as fears over the swine flu outbreak rattled commodity prices, dampening hopes for an economic recovery. The Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq composite also lost ground.</p>
<p>Crude oil fell for a second day on concern that the swine-flu outbreak will curtail travel and on forecasts that the U. S. economy will keep shrinking.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, governments and health officials around the world continued their efforts to detect and prevent the swine flu, which is prompting concerns about a new flu pandemic.</p>
<p>More than 700 people are being treated in hospital for serious respiratory illnesses in Mexico and 1,070 have been discharged.</p>
<p>There are 40 confirmed cases in the United States, all mild, in five states--New York, Ohio, Kansas, Texas and California. There are 26 confirmed cases in Mexico, one in Spain and two in Scotland.</p>
<p>Many businesses and public buildings in Mexico City were shut Monday and all schools throughout the country will be closed until May 6.</p>
<p>As the country's most populous city grappled with the swine flu outbreak, it was also rattled by a 6.0-magnitude earthquake. There are no initial reports of significant damage or injuries.</p>
<p>--------- Swine Flu Facts - Swine influenza is a common and sometimes fatal respiratory disease among pigs, first identified in 1930, that is caused by a type a influenza virus. - The World Health Organization says the virus can be contagious among humans in close contact and the outbreak has "pandemic potential," meaning there is risk of a spread across regions or continents. - Experts insist there is no certainty that a pandemic will happen or if so that it will be a mass killer. There are many unknowns about the new strain, especially how easily it spreads between people or how virulent it is. - Symptoms include sudden fever above 38 C, cough, headache, aching joints, nasal congestion, general fatigue and lack of appetite. Some people who have contracted the virus report runny nose, sore throat, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. In past cases, swine flu has caused pneumonia and respiratory failure and worsened chronic medical conditions. - The virus is respiratory, and not transmitted by food.</p>

<p>Re: "Deadly flu raises global alarm bells," April 26.</p>
<p>Before anyone in government gets too excited about the latest round of swine flu, we need to remember the debacle of March 1976 when the United States, followed by Canada, began the swine flu inoculation program.</p>
<p>The results were an unnecessary, expensive program and a number of people suffering from Guillain-Barre syndrome.</p>
<p>Constant references to the 1918 flu epidemic may capture more viewers and readers' interest.</p>
<p>But remembering then-president Gerald Ford's overblown reaction to a crisis that never happened would serve us better.</p>

</p>
<p>everyone dreads a real swine flu outbreak, but it's a safe bet that nobody worries more than the Stelmach government.</p>
<p>The hospital system is already so stressed, especially in the emergency wards, that a public health crisis could send it into chaos.</p>
<p>And that would provoke a political crisis for a government already in trouble over health care.</p>
<p>So it's no surprise that Premier Ed Stelmach's staff gets hourly calls with flu updates from health officials.</p>
<p>They're all concerned for Albertans, obviously. But they also know that if this does happen, it could bring the most dangerous challenge any Tory government has ever faced.</p>
<p>The Tories have been dancing on the edge of this cliff for a decade, ever since they shut hospitals, but dragged their feet on building promised new facilities.</p>
<p>Space is so tight that everybody dreads a big public crisis; a sour gas disaster, a commercial airline crash, a devastating tornado, or, worst of all, a sustained epidemic.</p>
<p>In the past few years the Tories have raced to catch up. Not fast enough. A flu pandemic would catch the system as short of capacity as it's ever been.</p>
<p>Dr. David Swann, the Liberal leader who was a medical officer of health himself, thinks doctors and nurses could pull us through a mild upsurge of a new flu.</p>
<p>"We are ready for this," he says. "We've been preparing for more than a decade and we know what to do. I believe people in the system will respond very well and will handle it."</p>
<p>He's probably right. Alberta's superb first responders and medical staff would work impossible hours and improvise solutions.</p>
<p>And it's still possible, even likely, that this trouble will pass us by.</p>
<p>But what if we are it hit by a pandemic with thousands of people sick and many dying?</p>
<p>"The hospital system would collapse," Dr. Swann says flatly. "There just isn't the capacity to handle it."</p>
<p>Other provincial systems would be in trouble, too, of course. Nothing can be built to handle the heaviest use imaginable--no highway, airport or hospital.</p>
<p>In smart systems, though, there's always some spare capacity. Not here. Our hospitals, especially in Calgary, have virtually no breathing room from day to day.</p>
<p>They run over 90 per cent full, a situation the experts say amounts to full use.</p>
<p>The system is like a car with tires designed to blow at 100 km/h. The car is already going 95 every day. A flu epidemic would push it up to 120. Boom, we're off the road.</p>
<p>It's a national problem. Dr. Brian Ward, from McGill University, says: "We don't have a lot of surge capacity in our health service."</p>
<p>Swann says flu victims would immediately have priority. People and space would be diverted from non-flu patients already facing long waits for surgery or emergency ward care. The system would be forced either to kick regular patients out of hospitals, or build makeshift space for the pandemic victims (expect to see pressurized domes, Swann says.)</p>
<p>The province has a pandemic plan that's reassuring to read. Everyone learned a lot from SARS. The experts know what must be done.</p>
<p>The question is whether they have the space and the people to do it.</p>
<p>And the answer is, they don't. What to do in the face of this? Prayer would be a start. Then</p>
<p>get ready to care for yourself and your family, because the health system might not.</p>

<p>The beaches and resorts in Mexico had already been quiet because of a slumping world economy and a violent drug war, but a new outbreak of swine flu threatens to keep even more Canadians away from our favourite winter getaway.</p>
<p>More than a million Canadians travel to Mexico annually, helping bring $13 billion US a year to Mexico's coffers. But Mexican finance minister Agustin Carstens has said there's "high potential" the swine flu outbreak will disrupt the country's economy, with those in the tourism industry expected to be hardest hit.</p>
<p>Canadian travel agents and airlines say they're already receiving calls from paid customers who no longer wish to visit Mexico, and are instead opting for other hot destinations.</p>
<p>As of midday Monday, WestJet's call centre had received 29 calls for changes, affecting 46 guests, and it expected that figure to rise. At the Toronto-based iTravel2000.com,83 people had already called in to make changes to their travel plans. "We've been rebooking many of them," said Stuart Morris, VP of the travel site.</p>
<p>Flight Centre, a travel agent with 130 stores across Canada, said its customers heading to Mexico in the coming weeks are also opting to spend their vacation dollars else-where, in places such as the Cuba and Dominican Republic.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Signs of recovery amid falling commodity prices; Scotiabank specialist sees seeds of hope in rebound of oil, copper</b>
</div><div>John Morrissy   </div>
<div>Financial Post; Canwest News Service</div>
<div>479 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>E3</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Commodity prices continued to slide in March, falling 2.8 per cent from the month before, but while they will fall further in the months ahead, signs of recovery are beginning to emerge, Scotiabank says in its monthly commodity index.</p>
<p>While the bottom is likely already in for some materials like copper, which fell as low as $1.26 US a pound on Dec. 24 and have since rallied back to a recent high of $2.16, downward pressure on others like coking coal, iron ore and possibly potash will continue to pull the index lower, said Scotiabank commodities specialist Patricia Mohr.</p>
<p>Rising prices for base metals and oil, driven higher from a bottom of $32.40 US a barrel in December to today's $45 to $54 US range, are harbingers of better times ahead for commodities, which are off 32.7 per cent from a year earlier, and suggest the index will end its declines later this year, Mohr said.</p>
<p>She bases her outlook on the fact that demand in China is now rebounding thanks to government stimulus spending, on the likelihood that the worst of the U.S. credit crisis has passed and on expectations that incentives to encourage car owners to scrap older vehicles in China and Germany will counter the collapse in global auto sales.</p>
<p>Mohr said it was too early to tell how Mexico's quickly spreading swine flu outbreak could affect the direction of commodity prices, although fears of its impact on the global economy knocked 1.5 per cent from the Reuters/Jefferies Commodity Price Index on Monday.</p>
<p>Feed grains like barley and corn, already facing a weak outlook, could be hurt as a result of possible culling of hog herds, Mohr said.</p>
<p>Within the Scotiabank index, which tracks key Canadian commodities for export markets, metals and minerals fell 4.3 per cent month over month in March, while oil and gas fell 2.6 per cent, and forest products 3.3 per cent.</p>
<p>Agriculture was the only sub-component to rise, gaining two per cent on stronger hog and Atlantic coast lobster prices.</p>
<p>In a separate report, <span class="companylink">Bank of Montreal</span> commodities analyst Bart Melek said the Chinese government's announcement Friday it had boosted gold reserves 75 per cent since 2003 would take the edge off downside pressure on bullion coming from a short-term rise in the dollar and lower rate of inflation.</p>
<p>Melek said the move "makes gold look more attractive to investors generally.</p>
<p>"In addition, it may persuade equity investors to discount a somewhat higher longer-term gold prices when valuing gold mining stocks." Gold is now trading above $900 US after a two-month slide in February and March.</p>

<p>MITSUBISHI CONFIDENT OF PROFIT PICTURE</p>
<p>TOKYO - <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Motors Corp</span>. on Monday forecast a surprise profit in the year ahead despite falling into the red in the latest quarter, as it counts on cost cuts to offset a slide in global vehicle sales.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Motors</span>' sales have plunged at alarming rates -- by 66 per cent in the key Russian market last quarter -- interrupting its progress towards sustained growth with the help of sister companies in the Mitsubishi group.</p>
<p>"Recovery is still going to take some time," president Osamu Masuko told a news conference.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Motors</span> shares were up 3.4 per cent at 154 yen ($1.94 Cdn) after its positive forecast.</p>
<p>Masuko added that Russia and Ukraine would no longer be one of <span class="companylink">Mitsubishi Motors</span>' growth centres. Instead, the automaker will rely more on markets such as Southeast Asia, Canada, Brazil, the Middle East and China.</p>
<p>Defying consensus forecasts, the company, best known for its Outlander sport utility vehicle, forecast an operating profit of 30 billion yen ($378 million) and net profit of five billion yen for the financial year to the end of next March. It is assuming a tougher U.S. dollar rate of 92 yen and euro of 116 yen, versus 101 and 144 last year.</p>
<p>Six analysts had forecast an average operating loss of 43 billion yen.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, <span class="companylink">Toyota Motor Corp</span>. unit <span class="companylink">Daihatsu Motor Co</span>. forecast a 56-per-cent drop in operating profit to 17 billion yen ($214.6 million) for 2009-10, short of a consensus forecast of 28 billion yen.</p>
<p>In July, Mitsubishi will roll out the i-MiEV electric car to fleet customers in Japan, taking a lead in the zero-emissions segment.</p>
<p>CITIGROUP WARY OF RAILWAYS</p>
<p>NEW YORK - <span class="companylink">Citigroup</span> is sounding a cautious note on the railway sector, citing narrowing pricing gains and regulatory concerns. It downgraded three companies in the sector.</p>
<p>Citi downgraded Canadian National Railway to "hold" from "buy" and <span class="companylink">Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corp</span>. and Canadian Pacific Railway to "sell" from "hold."</p>
<p>Noting the recent rally in Canadian National shares, Citi said the stock had risen 39 per cent since the company's early March lows and 11 per cent year-to-date.</p>
<p>FLU ALERT PROMPTS PORK BANS</p>
<p>GENEVA - Outbreaks of swine flu have prompted several countries to ban the import of pork, raising the prospect the disease will add a further protectionist blow to sagging world trade.</p>
<p>International trade rules allow countries to restrict or ban imports for health and safety reasons -- but this has to be based on scientific evidence. The World Health Organization says swine flu does not spread by eating pork.</p>
<p>FLU DRUG MAKERS GEAR UP</p>
<p>PARIS - <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span> and <span class="companylink">Roche Holding AG</span> are getting ready to boost production of flu drugs as the swine influenza outbreak spreads beyond Mexico and heightens fears of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Each extra $200 million US in sales of flu-related products would add about 0.5 per cent to Roche and Glaxo earnings per share, <span class="companylink">Credit Suisse</span> analysts wrote Monday in a note to clients.</p>
<p>MAGNA IMPRESSES GERMANY</p>
<p>BERLIN - German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier has gained a "positive impression" of auto-parts supplier Magna after holding talks with the potential investor in <span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>.'s Opel unit, his ministry said on Monday.</p>
<p>"You can certainly assume that from these phone calls he got a positive impression overall about the company in terms of its previous activity in this sector," said Foreign Ministry spokesman Jens Ploetner.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Fiat SpA</span> has emerged as another possible suitor for Opel, whose future depends on GM and the German government finding an investor. Meanwhile, workers at <span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>.'s Opel division are holding back on an agreement to cut labour costs by $1.2 billion US to avoid accepting an investor they don't want.</p>
<p>INTREPID ENERGY HAS A BUYER</p>
<p>TORONTO - Canada's <span class="companylink">Daylight Resources Trust</span> has agreed to buy Intrepid Energy Corp., a privately held junior Alberta oil and gas producer, in a $109-million deal that will boost its total production by about 13 per cent. Under the cash and stock deal, Daylight will pay 7.25 million of its trust units and $32 million of cash, plus assumed net debt of about $25 million.</p>
<p>Daylight said Intrepid Energy currently produces about 3,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day with over 90 per cent of this production within Daylight's core west central Alberta area.</p>
<p>VEDANTA BUYS HUDBAY STAKE</p>
<p>TORONTO - Indian mining group <span class="companylink">Vedanta Resources PLC</span> said on Monday it had bought a 9.5-per-cent stake in <span class="companylink">HudBay Minerals Inc</span>., but gave no reason for the move.</p>
<p>London-listed Vedanta, India's largest base metals miner, confirmed a newspaper report it had bought 14.5 million HudBay shares, through a subsidiary, Lakomasko BV, a privately held company based in Amsterdam.</p>
<p>DECLINE AT U.S. NEWSPAPERS</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Weekday circulation at U.S. newspapers declined 7.1 per cent in the six months through March 31, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations. Daily average circulation for 395 newspapers fell to 34.4 million from 37.1 million in the year-earlier period, the bureau said Monday.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">CONDE NAST</span> TO SHUT PORTFOLIO</p>
<p>NEW YORK - Conde Nast is closing its Portfolio business magazine two years after it launched, making its more than 80 employees the latest casualties of a decline in ad spending afflicting the entire publishing business. "The pressures and realities of the continuous deep economic slump have lowered Portfolio's revenue projections below what is needed to continue publication," Conde Nast chief executive Charles Townsend said Monday.</p>
<p>U.S. HOME VACANCIES RISE</p>
<p>WASHINGTON - A record 19.1 million homes stood unoccupied in the first quarter and the U.S. home ownership rate fell as the recession sapped demand for real estate.</p>
<p>The number of vacant homes, including foreclosures, properties for sale and vacation properties, jumped from 18.6 million a year earlier, the U.S. Census Bureau said in a report Monday. Households that own their own residence declined for the third straight quarter to 67.3 per cent.</p>
<p>NISSAN UPBEAT ON ELECTRIC CARS</p>
<p>TOKYO - <span class="companylink">Nissan Motor Co</span>., Japan's third-largest carmaker, expects a global economic recovery to push oil prices higher, creating demand for battery-powered cars the company intends to introduce next year.</p>
<p>The Tokyo-based automaker plans to follow its U.S. and Japan electric-car introductions globally, banking on growing demand for fuel-efficient vehicles. Economic recovery will also allow the automaker to achieve sales targets it set last year -- before the crisis -- for high-growth markets like Brazil, Russia, India and China, by 2012.</p>
<p>PROFIT SURPRISE AT WHIRLPOOL</p>
<p>NEW YORK - <span class="companylink">Whirlpool Corp</span>. reported a surprise quarterly profit Monday as cost-cutting efforts helped the world's biggest appliance maker weather a slump in global sales.</p>
<p>Whirlpool, which has been in talks with banks about renewing credit lines, has frozen salaries, reduced its contribution to retirement plans and taken other steps, including closing plants in the U.S. and China.</p>
<p>Adjusted for one-time items, profit came to 59 cents a share, while analysts on average were expecting a loss of 18 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.</p>
<p>ABITIBIBOWATER CANCELS DEAL</p>
<p>MONTREAL - <span class="companylink">AbitibiBowater Inc</span>. has cancelled a key fibre-supply contract with SFK Pulp, the Quebec-based pulp producer said Monday.</p>
<p>SFK was informed late Friday by the Abitibi-Consolidated Co. unit of the international giant, that it was terminating, effective immediately, the fibre and bark supply agreements entered into between SFK Pulp and Abitibi in 2002 as SFK Pulp was created by Abitibi. Abitibi had committed to supply fibre and bark to SFK's Saint-Felicien Mill for 20 years. On April 16, in connection with <span class="companylink">AbitibiBowater</span>'s filing for protection from its creditors, Abitibi was granted the right to terminate all of its contracts, subject to court approval.</p>

<p>The Canadian Tour event scheduled this week in Mexico will proceed, but no spectators will be allowed on the golf course to watch the tournament.</p>
<p>Players are also prohibited from using local Mexican caddies at the San Luis Potosi Open in an effort to prevent the spread of the swine flu virus that has hit Mexico hard in the past week. About 40 Canadians are in the field at the $125,000 US event in north-central Mexico.</p>
<p>"We are taking every precaution with our players at San Luis Potosi and will watch the situation closely‚" Canadian Tour commissioner Richard Janes said in a release Monday.</p>
<p>This week's tournament is the second of three straight Canadian Tour events in Mexico. Janes said between 10 and 15 players have withdrawn from this week's tournament.</p>

<p>North American junior soccer championship matches scheduled this week in Tijuana have been cancelled after a Mexican outbreak of swine flu, CONCACAF general secretary Chuck Blazer said on Monday.</p>
<p>Mexico, Honduras, Costa Rica and the United States had already qualified for the four regional berths in the FIFA Under-17 World Cup later this year in Nigeria. Semifinals and final matches to decide seeds were called off.</p>

<p>The second leg of the CONCACAF Champions League final between Mexican clubs Cruz Azul and Atlante, scheduled for Wednesday in Cancun, was postponed to May 12. Atlante lead after a 2-0 win at Mexico City last week.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>New testing available in Alberta labs expected to speed swine flu diagnosis; Province can expect first cases soon, chief medical officer says</b>
</div><div>Keith Gerein and Trish Audette   </div>
<div>The Edmonton Journal</div>
<div>850 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Edmonton Journal</div><div>EDJR</div><div>Final</div><div>A2</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Edmonton Journal   </div>
</p>
<p>Swine influenza is likely on its way to Alberta, but health officials say they will be quickly alerted to any cases, thanks to a decision to conduct more of the testing within the province.</p>
<p>Currently, samples are sent to Winnipeg's National Microbiology Laboratory, since it's the only facility that can make a confirmation of the type of flu virus. Getting results can often take a few days.</p>
<p>But provincial labs in Edmonton and Calgary will begin doing the tests this week, which should allow results to come back in 24 hours, Health Minister Ron Liepert said.</p>
<p>"Our chief medical officer of health has put Alberta Health Services on high alert to make sure that anything that has indications of symptoms is brought forward immediately," he said Monday.</p>
<p>The chief medical officer of health, Andre Corriveau, said he expects the province will soon see its first case of swine flu, which was initially reported in Mexico and has since popped up in other countries, including Canada and the United States.</p>
<p>But there is no cause for panic at this point, he said, since the strain is showing signs of being relatively gentle.</p>
<p>Patients in Canada have so far recovered quickly.</p>
<p>"Judging from the fact it has spread across the United States, it's probably true we will eventually get a case, but I can't tell you when that will occur," Corriveau said.</p>
<p>"From the data we have from the States and in Canada, this bug, although very novel, seems to be</p>
<p>behaving like any other flu and perhaps even more mildly than our regular influenza we had most of the winter."</p>
<p>He would not say whether Alberta currently has any suspected cases, suggesting such information would be misleading since the numbers change constantly.</p>
<p>Albertans are unlikely to get the virus unless they have been to Mexico recently or have been around someone who recently returned from Mexico and has developed symptoms, he said.</p>
<p>Still, the province is stepping up surveillance. People who report having the flu go through a screening process, which now includes more questions about where they have been on trips and whether they have been around travellers. Testing is then prioritized based on the answers to those questions, along with symptoms.</p>
<p>At airports, passengers returning from Mexico are handed a notice telling them they must report to border services staff if they have cold or flu symptoms.</p>
<p>Border services personnel are also on the lookout for sick people, and will call in quarantine officers if needed. Some airports, including Edmonton, do not have quarantine officers, even though flights regularly come in from Mexico.</p>
<p>If a sick passenger from one of those flights is spotted in Edmonton, border staff will phone quarantine officers at another airport, who then dispatch local heath authorities to deal with the situation.</p>
<p>Complicating matters is the fact that the normal flu season has not yet ended in Alberta and there are still many viruses circulating, Corriveau said. At the same time, news of the swine flu outbreak led to a surge in calls to Alberta HealthLink, along with more people questioning family doctors or making visits to emergency rooms.</p>
<p>"Part of the problem is that there is a lot of background noise," he said. "Some of the cases that were reported to us as suspect cases have turned out to be the most common forms of influenza ... so a lot of our work is being spent trying to sort that out."</p>
<p>He said unless people develop unusual symptoms, the best approach is to treat it like any other flu -- stay home, call for advice if needed, wash your hands often, and take other precautions to prevent spreading the virus.</p>
<p>People with flu symptoms who have recently returned from Mexico are urged to call HealthLink (780-408-5465) or toll-free 1-866-408-5465 before visiting a hospital or doctor's office.</p>
<p>If an outbreak does eventually occur, Alberta is in good shape to respond, Corriveau said.</p>
<p>The country has stockpiles of anti-viral drugs that would be used to treat the sick, and Alberta has access to enough to "handle anything that might emerge," he said.</p>
<p>Corriveau didn't know the precise number but said the stockpiles have been set aside to respond to a moderate-to-severe pandemic.</p>
<p>Bob Black, director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness for the city, said Edmonton's pandemic plan will be implemented if the swine influenza poses a serious risk here.</p>
<p>The plan, which was last tested in 2007, ensures essential services such as police and fire are available in the event of a major outbreak.</p>
<p>Employment and Immigration Minister Hector Goudreau said it's up to Ottawa to monitor the health of Mexicans who come to Canada for summer to work in agriculture.</p>

<p>ACCUSED REF KILLER WAS A 'STANDUP GUY'</p>
<p>SASKATOON -- Former Seattle Thunderbird Ladislav Scurko has been accused of stabbing to death a 26-year-old referee at a highway service area in his home country of Slovakia in January 2008. Marek Liptaj's body was found buried in the forest in December. Scurko, 23, played for Seattle's WHL team from 2004-06 and the Tri-City Americans for part of the 2006-07 season. He then returned to Slovakia, where he was playing for a pro team in Kosice. His former WHL teammates were shocked to hear the news. "It's unbelievable," said Chris Durand. "When I played with him in Seattle, he was a great guy -- a standup guy ... I'm pretty blown back by it."</p>

<p>A 5.6 magnitude earthquake hit southern Mexico on Monday, shaking buildings far away in Mexico's flu-hit capital, but there were no major reports of deaths or damage. A woman died of a heart attack near the quake's epicentre in the southern state of Guerrero, home to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, officials said, but there were no other casualties reported. The tremor was felt in Mexico City, about 240 km away, and hundreds of people evacuated buildings. Most wore surgical face masks as protection against a swine flu outbreak that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico.</p>

<p>Travellers worried about taking trips to Mexico in the near future may be given some relief, depending on which airline they're using.</p>
<p>Transat Holidays, WestJet and Air Canada are offering travellers who were planning to fly to Mexico between now and May 11 a few options, said Dale Urquhart, director of travel services with BCAA.</p>
<p>While no refunds are yet being being given because of the swine flu outbreak in Mexico, some airlines are allowing travellers to either change the dates of their vacations, or change the destination to somewhere like Cuba.</p>
<p>"There seems to be some flexibility," Urquhart said.</p>
<p>If the federal government issues a travel advisory for Mexico -- recommending no non-essential travel to the country -- airlines will likely start to issue refunds, she said.</p>
<p>For those returning from Mexico, there are no new screening measures at Vancouver International Airport, but quarantine officers are on location to handle any suspicious symptoms.</p>
<p>Dr. Patricia Daly, chief medical health officer for Vancouver Coastal Health, said the airport is always staffed with quarantine officers who are alerted by airline staff or customs officers when they see a traveller with signs of a severe illness. The quarantine officers then arrange for a medical examination of the passenger.</p>
<p>Daly said she had not been notified of any recent quarantine incidents with respect to anyone off a flight from Mexico.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Mexican farm workers to be screened for flu; A double screening process is in place before workers board flights to Canada</b>

</p>
<p>Mexican farm workers coming to B.C. will have to undergo a double screening process for swine flu before boarding flights to Canada.</p>
<p>Migrant workers are still being allowed into Canada, but will be under "great scrutiny" before their travels, Estela Garcia of the Mexican Consulate in Vancouver said Monday.</p>
<p>"Every worker will be screened," Garcia said.</p>
<p>Workers will first go for a routine medical examination a couple of weeks before their scheduled departure. If they do not have any flu symptoms at that time, they will be given the green light to travel to Canada.</p>
<p>Then, 24 hours before departure, they will be required to fill out a questionnaire about their health. After that, they will each be checked by a physician at the airport before boarding their flight.</p>
<p>"A physician will be there to check them one by one," Garcia said.</p>
<p>There are about 1,400 Mexican farm workers in B.C., and about 600 more are expected in the coming months.</p>
<p>The airport medical examinations have already begun, and information pamphlets about swine flu are being distributed to B.C. farms that already have Mexican workers, Garcia said.</p>
<p>Among workers who are already here, there have been no reports of illness, but Garcia said employers are being advised of the situation and instructed to keep an eye out for flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Most workers stay in the country for four to five months, working on farms throughout the province. Many of the 1,400 who are already here are scheduled to depart in the next month or so, Garcia said.</p>
<p>Glen Lucas, of the B.C. Fruit Growers' Association, said there will likely be less need this year for Mexican workers than in previous years because of the economic downturn. But a ban on foreign workers would be a problem for those who depend on them to pick their berry or apple harvests.</p>

</div><div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>560 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A12</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>The emergence of a new strain of swine flu brings with it many dangers -- and most of them have nothing to do with the medical effects of the virus itself.</p>
<p>One of the most dangerous things governments can do is miscalculate the relative importance of health risks, thus skewing funding and attention. Every year, there are about nine million new cases of tuberculosis, 247 million cases of malaria, and nearly three million new HIV infections.</p>
<p>Even in the very unlikely event that this new virus does cause a global influenza epidemic like the one in 1918, that would not make it any worse than the existing global epidemics of preventable, communicable diseases that seldom make the headlines and never draw enough funding.</p>
<p>Of course, it is nonetheless in everyone's interest to make sure that swine flu doesn't cause a pandemic. But hasty overreactions aren't the way to do that. A vaccine against a version of swine flu in the 1970s ended up killing more people than the virus did. Every preventive measure can have unintended consequences. If Canadians were to start running to the emergency room every time they got the sniffles, the health-care system will be unable to function properly.</p>
<p>If other countries slap travel advisories on Canada because a few cases have turned up here, or if international trade slows because of unnecessary barriers at the borders, the consequences to the economy could be severe, even if swine flu itself turns out to be a mere blip on the radar of the epidemiologists.</p>
<p>Every country has a tendency to look inward when a crisis threatens, but governments must fight that tendency. Influenza is a global threat, and can only be prevented through co-ordinated international action. We learned this, if we didn't know it before, from the SARS outbreak in 2002 and 2003, and from avian flu. As the world comes to grips with the threat of swine flu, it's crucial that governments around the world be forthcoming with complete and accurate information. China, that means you.</p>
<p>If the virus is allowed to take hold anywhere in the world, the risks to people everywhere will be higher. Canada has already helped Mexico assess its situation by testing samples sent to a Canadian lab. We can do more: Canada can send drugs, lab equipment and facemasks so that frontline clinics in Mexico can diagnose, treat and prevent swine flu.</p>
<p>Within Canada, good communication is key. It will be a lot easier for Canadians to deal with changes to rules in hospitals and other public places if those rules are consistent, logical and well explained.</p>
<p>Fear is a funny thing. Reason tells us that swine flu is, so far, no reason to worry. But it's new, and incompletely understood, and it seems to attack the young and healthy. That makes it scary.</p>
<p>Good policy, though, is based on evidence, not fear. Canada must do its part to deal with this new threat, without allowing it to distract attention from more pressing international crises. The global economy is still in dire straits. The climate is still warming. Genocides rage. Refugees are running for their lives. The diseases of poverty are killing children. For anyone inclined to worry, there is no shortage of reasons.</p>

<p>Major cruise companies operating between the U.S. and Mexico have not changed their routes due to the swine flu outbreak, the Miami-based companies said Monday. Carnival Cruises told AFP there are no reported cases on its ships or ports of call, while Royal Caribbean said it is closely monitoring developments. Norwegian Cruise Line said its onboard medical centres were "stocking an appropriate amount of the anti-viral medication."</p>

<div id="hd"><b>'Hospitals at edge of capacity'</b>
</div><div>Pauline Tam   </div>
<div>The Ottawa Citizen</div>
<div>996 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Ottawa Citizen</div><div>OTCT</div><div>Final</div><div>A1 / FRONT</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright © 2009 Ottawa Citizen   </div>
</p>
<p>As area hospitals respond to the heightened alert over swine flu, emergency planners are grappling with whether they will have enough nurses and doctors to treat a sudden surge in patients if the deadly outbreak in Mexico triggers a pandemic here.</p>
<p>"It's the million-dollar question because hospitals are at the edge in terms of their capacity already," said Thomas Hayes, who chairs a committee of emergency planners from area hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care providers.</p>
<p>"A lot of planning has been put into this because this is really the magic question: Do we have the capacity to handle this?"</p>
<p>As part of Ontario's first real test of pandemic preparedness planning following the 2002-03 SARS epidemic, area hospitals are reviewing their contingency plans, which spell out various ways to boost their staffing levels in the event the province declares a pandemic in the city. That includes keeping an on-call roster of retired staff that could augment existing ranks of workers.</p>
<p>But according to the City of Ottawa's pandemic plan, meeting the increased demand for health-care workers would be a major challenge. A worst-case scenario contained in the plan indicates a flu pandemic in the city could result in as many as 294,000 cases, with nearly 157,000 needing medical care, 3,500 hospitalized and nearly 800 deaths.</p>
<p>"Such an outbreak will clearly place huge demands on families, community services and the entire health care system," the plan concludes.</p>
<p>With area hospitals already plagued by overcrowding, cancelled surgeries and some of Ontario's longest emergency-room waits, a sudden flood of pandemic patients would seriously strain a hospital's ability to cope, said Hayes, who's also director of occupational safety and emergency preparedness at The Ottawa Hospital.</p>
<p>To minimize the potential of a staffing shortage, most elective surgeries would likely be cancelled as operating-room nurses and doctors are reassigned to emergency departments, intensive-care units and medical wards.</p>
<p>"I won't speak to the individual details because we're not there yet. But there's a very detailed plan within each hospital, including The Ottawa Hospital and the other ones in the city, that spells out what would be cancelled to free up staff, what are the priorities that we have agreed on across the city, and how we would scale back," said Hayes.</p>
<p>Under the city's pandemic plan, health officials could also open walk-in clinics to ease the pressure on emergency rooms, Hayes said. "If we need to, if it gets to the point where the public needs to have somewhere to go besides the emergency department, we can open that up. But we're not at that stage yet."</p>
<p>Swine flu screening, which has been in place since late last week, is part of the precautions being taken as health officials step up pandemic surveillance in the region.</p>
<p>Patients who show up in emergency rooms complaining of flu-like symptoms -- cough, cold, aches and fever -- are asked about their travel history within the past week and about anyone they've been in contact with who may have travelled within the same period.</p>
<p>"It means whoever comes in with this profile gets a higher level of attention," said Dr. Frank Knoefel, vice-president of medical affairs at Bruyère Continuing Care.</p>
<p>Those who fit the criteria would immediately be placed under quarantine, jumpstarting infection-control measures that ensure nurses and doctors who treat such patients use gowns, gloves, respirators and face shields to protect themselves.</p>
<p>The patients would then be tested for the swine flu virus. Each suspected case would be reported to Ottawa Public Health, which oversees the city's pandemic response, said Dany Larivée, infection control manager at the Montfort Hospital.</p>
<p>Public health officials would also be in charge of arranging medical monitoring and followup for an infected patient's family, said Larivée.</p>
<p>Already, hospitals are gearing up their pandemic response by holding daily meetings of their in-house emergency preparedness committees. They are also consulting with their counterparts across the region.</p>
<p>The first such meeting, which took place Monday, included officials from The Ottawa Hospital, Queensway Carleton Hospital, Montfort, Bruyère, Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre and Arnprior and District Memorial Hospital. A second meeting, to include representatives from paramedics, nursing homes, community health centres, and home-care providers, is expected to today.</p>
<p>Hayes said the goal is to share information and ensure decisions are made in conjunction with public health officials. "It's also to decide whether we need to start ramping up our response further than what we've done already," said Hayes.</p>
<p>In the meantime, hospital officials say they are checking to ensure their stockpiles of diagnostic tests and anti-viral medicine are up-to-date, as required under the provincial pandemic response plan.</p>
<p>At Bruyère Continuing Care, which runs a geriatric hospital, a hospital for complex-care patients, several nursing homes and two family health clinics, officials are monitoring any changes in patient health. Many are at risk of contracting respiratory infections because they are elderly and have underlying illnesses that can weaken their immune systems.</p>

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization Monday warned of a heightened threat of a global pandemic, but public health officials in Ottawa say the nation's capital is in good shape to deal with any danger.</p>
<p>Ottawa chief medical officer of health, Dr. Isra Levy, said Monday that the city -- indeed, the country -- is as ready as it could be to face a pandemic.</p>
<p>He said 50 million doses of antiviral drugs had been stockpiled, more than enough for every Canadian. The drugs are the first line of defence.</p>
<p>Ottawa, he said, would be well protected.</p>
<p>Levy also revealed that five people in Ottawa who travelled to Mexico and came back with flu symptoms are being monitored by public health authorities. There is, however, no indication that they have contracted the deadly virus, he said.</p>
<p>Speaking to reporters in Ottawa, Levy said public health authorities in the city, with support from Ontario and the federal government, are very much on top of the problem.</p>
<p>"The country, the province, the city has been preparing for a pandemic quite aggressively now for several years and the experience that Canada and Ontario had during the SARS epidemic really gave us a lot of lessons," Levy said.</p>
<p>"We do know things that we didn't know before. The response you've seen within the last week -- the enhanced surveillance response and the very rapid laboratory investigation -- is quite promising. We're better prepared."</p>
<p>Senator Colin Kenny, long a critic of Canada's poor emergency readiness, agreed. Kenny's Senate committee on national security and defence wrote a scathing report in 2004 about Canada's lack of readiness, but he now acknowledges things have improved significantly.</p>
<p>"I can say with confidence that we have moved miles beyond where we were when SARS was arriving," Kenny said.</p>
<p>"We have in place a more effective system of tracking diseases and getting the information out there more quickly to allow public health experts to arrive at decisions faster and more accurately."</p>
<p>As the swine flu in Mexico continues on its path, with the death toll rising to 149, the WHO raised its flu pandemic alert level to four -- up from three -- signalling "a significant step toward pandemic influenza." Level 3 indicates sporadic cases of flu or clusters of cases in people, but no person-to-person transmission except in specific cases. Level 6 is a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>About the same time the WHO upped the ante, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said whatever the WHO decides, "we are proceeding as if we are preparatory to a full pandemic." And on the same day, the number of infections in the U.S. passed 40, the Centers for Disease Control released 25 per cent of a federal stockpile of antiviral drugs -- about 11 million doses -- to the states. President Barack Obama warned against tourist travel to Mexico and U.S. officials said they would begin screening visitors from infected areas in Mexico.</p>
<p>Canada has not asked people to avoid Mexico, but a Public Health Agency of Canada spokesman said screening of travellers from Mexico has begun at Canadian airports.</p>
<p>While Ontario has so far had no reported cases of swine flu, Ottawa-area hospitals have screened a number of individuals who have recently travelled to Mexico and who appear to have mild symptoms associated with the outbreak, said Thomas Hayes, who chairs a committee of emergency planners from area hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care providers.</p>
<p>"There are a number of individuals of interest, certainly in Ottawa and around the province, that from a public health perspective we continue to monitor to stay on top of things," Levy said.</p>
<p>For the past five years, he said, Ottawa's public health department has been working with the city and community agencies to develop a comprehensive plan, setting out strategies and clear responsibilities in the event of a pandemic.</p>
<p>In a massive and virulent outbreak, hospitals and clinics could be overwhelmed and doctors, nurses, health workers and other emergency responders would find it hard to cope.</p>
<p>"There's always the potential for running out of sustainability," Kenny said.</p>
<p>The plan lays out what to expect, what various departments and individuals have to do, who is responsible for what equipment, and details a command structure that is clear and unambiguous. Also, learning from the 9/11 experience, clear lines of communication have been established to ensure information flows freely.</p>
<p>The first line of defence during a flu pandemic is antiviral drugs that can be stored in large quantities, unlike vaccines, which can only be produced once the particular flu strain is known.</p>
<p>The antiviral drugs stop the virus from reproducing inside a body, arresting the growth of the disease and buying essential time for the appropriate vaccine to be produced. The city plan sets out who gets the drugs and vaccines first -- health professionals such as doctors, nurses, pharmacists, ambulance crews and lab technicians. They would be followed by other first responders, such as police officers, firefighters and funeral home employees.</p>
<p>The city plan acknowledges problems and pressures that might arise and makes alternative arrangements to use schools, community halls, churches, mosques and synagogues as makeshift hospitals or shelters. Other plans include how to deal with mass deaths and mass burials, grim realities in a pandemic. With hospital morgues likely to be filled to overflowing, refrigerator trucks could be used to temporarily store corpses. If the pandemic is really bad, trucks may not be enough to store the dead and community arenas and ice rinks could be pressed into service.</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario will likely never happen, but Kenny says the country has to "plan for the worst and hope for the best."</p>
<p>- - -</p>
<p>On Alert</p>
<p>The World Health Organization -- WHO -- has a six-scale alert system that it uses to determine the severity of pandemics and help countries plan.</p>
<p>Level 1: No viruses circulating among animals have been reported to cause infections in humans.</p>
<p>Level 2: An animal flu virus circulating among animals is known to have caused infection in people and therefore poses a potential pandemic threat.</p>
<p>Level 3: Animal or human-animal flu virus causing sporadic cases or clusters of cases in people, but no large-scale human-to-human transmission.</p>
<p>Level 4: (The current level) Sustained human-to-human transmission that raises real threat of pandemic.</p>
<p>Level 5: Widespread human infection signalling that a pandemic is imminent.</p>
<p>Level 6: Onset of a new pandemic with sustained human-to-human transmission over many countries.</p>

<p>Officials of this weekend's Canada Cup diving tournament in Montreal are breaking out the hand sanitizers, keeping a doctor on standby and cautioning athletes on methods of disease prevention after the swine flu outbreak created havoc at the diving World Series event last week in Mexico City.</p>
<p>Divers competed in front of empty stands and fans were banned by health authorities from attending the Mexican event because of concerns about contagion. Organizers lost as much as $600,000, says Mitch Geller, chief technical officer for Diving Canada.</p>
<p>"It was an aggressive move to go that far," Geller said. "I'm not aware of it ever being done. It was a strange circumstance...</p>
<p>"It obviously can affect the competition and it makes the money invested by the Mexican federation and the city a total write off. You have to fly in judges, supply prize money..."</p>
<p>There will be 67 divers from 14 nations competing at Montreal Olympic Sport Park, April 30-May 3. Some of them — Canadians, Australians and Mexicans — competed last week, but none of the athletes have displayed any flu symptoms, Geller said. If any do, they can be isolated from the others in a private room, said Patrick Godbout, director of media relations for Diving Canada.</p>
<p>Canada Cup officials are taking precautions "but not treating it as a problem. We're making sure everyone knows the basics of being careful. We're not shutting down. We welcome people to come," Godbout said.</p>
<p>Australia's Olympic gold medal diver Matthew Mitcham and silver medal-winning teammates Melissa Wu and Bree Cole retreated to their hotel rooms following the World Series final in Mexico City and waited for their flight to Canada.</p>
<p>"They kicked people out of the competition there, they just shut it down to the public. It was a little bit bizarre competing in that situation," Mitcham told the newspaper The Australian. "There were masks available at the reception desk of our hotel [in Mexico] and we wore them whenever we went out in public."</p>
<p>The swine flu outbreak has slammed other events on the Mexican sport agenda. Thursday's scheduled presentation of bid books by candidates for the 2015 Pan American Games — Toronto, Bogota, Colombia and Lima, Peru — has been postponed. It has yet to be rescheduled. The regional soccer body CONCACAF has cancelled the remaining rounds of its under-17 championship, postponed its beach soccer championship and rescheduled the second leg of its Champions League finals "to safeguard the health of players, officials and fans," a statement said.</p>
<p>Despite the withdrawal of 10 to 15 players, a Canadian Tour golf event will take place as scheduled in Mexico this week, although the San Luis Potosi Open will be closed to fans and local caddies, Canadian tour commissioner Rick Janes said.</p>
<p>"We are taking every precaution with our players at San Luis Potosi and will watch the situation closely," said Janes.</p>
<p>Precautions include the use of bottled water only, hand sanitizers, the availability of medical practitioners, and the recommendation that players stay at the club and host La Loma Resort and not travel into the town of San Luis Potosi.</p>
<p>The Canada Cup fields include 24 Olympic divers from last summer's Games in Beijing.</p>
<p>The 16-member Canadian team features Olympic silver medal winner Émilie Heymans, Meaghan Benfeito, Roseline Filion, Jennifer Abel, Riley McCormick and Reuben Ross.</p>
<p>Filion and Benfeito won the bronze Saturday in the women`s 10-metre synchro event to conclude the fourth and final stop on the FINA World Series diving circuit in Mexico. Wang Xin and Kang Li of China won the gold medal. Li was involved in all four victories for China in the event on the circuit. She won the first two gold with Olympic champion Chen Ruolin and the last two with Xin. Australians Cole and Wu were second in Mexico.</p>
<p>Filion and Benfeito collected two silvers, a bronze and a fourth place in the four World Series events, which are reserved for the top-eight ranked divers in the world in each event.</p>

<p>Don't panic, but North Americans would do well to keep themselves informed and take common-sense precautions to limit their potential exposure to this new swine flu strain.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health Organization and the governments of Mexico and Canada are working together to understand the nature of the swine influenza A/H1N1 virus and how and where it's being spread.</p>
<p>While much remains unknown about the virus, here's what the CDC does know: This strain of swine flu is being spread from human to human. Symptoms include high fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches, vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>Only those who are seriously ill should get medical attention right away. The drugs Tamiflu and Relenza have been effective in treating those with H1N1. Treatment is most effective if done within 48 hours of exposure. The CDC suggests frequent hand washing; covering your nose and mouth with a tissue when you cough or sneeze; avoiding touching your eyes, nose or mouth; and staying home from work or school if you become ill. Alcohol-based hand sanitizers are effective. There is no need for a face mask now.</p>

</p>
<p>As public health officials across Canada braced for more cases of a new swine flu virus and the World Health Organization ramped up its pandemic alert, some experts suggested yesterday the bug might not be the deadly menace it first appeared to be.</p>
<p>Most patients outside of Mexico have suffered only mild illness, infectious-disease specialists noted. And it is quite possible that tens of thousands of similarly slight cases have occurred, unnoticed, in Mexico itself, making the death rate from the virus there much less ominous, they said.</p>
<p>It is too early to rule out a disastrous global pandemic, but it is also not clear that the novel and "weird" flu that emerged in recent weeks will be more lethal than the regular, seasonal influenza, said some doctors.</p>
<p>"It's not the killer pandemic strain, at least on the surface without more information, that we would have feared," said Dr. Gerald Evans, president of the Association of Medical Microbiology and Infectious Disease Canada.</p>
<p>"Yes, new virus, probably a lot of susceptible people around the world ... but if it's a pandemic, it may not be one associated with that horrendously huge mortality that was seen with previous ones."</p>
<p>After a meeting of its emergency advisory committee yesterday, the WHO decided to raise its flu alert from phase three to phase four, with phase six being an actual pandemic. It said it was not in favour of restricting travel to regions with swine flu cases, arguing it is too late to contain the virus's spread.</p>
<p>In Ottawa, meanwhile, the Public Health Agency said it is considering an advisory against Canadians travelling to Mexico, but will allow the regular influx of migrant Mexican farm workers, after they have passed health screening in their country. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases here remained at six -- four in Nova Scotia, two in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Although Canada's cases and most of the 40 recorded in the United States have been mild infections, Dr. David Butler-Jones, the agency's head, said it is too early to rest easy.</p>
<p>"Simply because we're seeing mild symptoms so far, does not mean we can take this for granted," he told a news conference. "We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illness and we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well."</p>
<p>Still, questions remain about the risk posed by the H1N1 pathogen, a rare combination of swine, avian and human flu genetics. The virus has grabbed attention because it is new, has spread widely in Mexico, has crossed into other countries and appears to be potent, specialists said.</p>
<p>Evidence of its virulence comes from the somewhat sketchy data emerging from Mexico, which has had 1,900 cases and 149 deaths that it suspects are caused by the virus, leading some observers to talk of a relatively frightening 10% death rate.</p>
<p>The fact many of those infected have been young is also worrisome, given that seasonal flu tends to hit the sick and elderly hardest, and the infamous 1918 pandemic took a disproportionately high toll on the young, said Dr. Brian Ward, a McGill University infectious-disease specialist.</p>
<p>Yet only 26 of the Mexican cases have been confirmed by laboratory tests, and most of the suspected cases have been among people who got so ill that they ended up in hospital.</p>
<p>It is almost certain that many more -- perhaps tens of thousands more -- Mexicans contracted the swine flu and experienced little more than sniffles and aches and pains, never entering the health care system, said Dr. Bill Bowie of the University of British Columbia.</p>
<p>That would mean the total number of cases could be thousands or hundreds of thousands or even millions, placing the death rate much closer to that seen in a seasonal flu outbreak. It is believed influenza causes as many as 4,000 deaths in Canada annually.</p>
<p>It would seem that the virus has been infecting people for weeks, if not months, and there are likely many Canadians who unknowingly brought it back with them earlier this year, Dr. Evans said.</p>
<p>The problem, though, is that the true scope of the outbreak in Mexico is just not known, and its health care system is not equipped to carry out the same kind of surveillance occurring now in Canada and other countries.</p>
<p>At this stage, also, it is too early to judge how virulent the disease will prove to be in countries like Canada, said Dr. Geoff Taylor, an infectious-disease expert at the University of Alberta. It is still possible it could turn into something very worrisome, Dr. Ward said. Even if that does not happen, a virus that infects more people than the seasonal flu or that is even slightly more virulent could mean scores more deaths, he noted.</p>
<p>"There are a number of things that are worrisome," he said. "It's a weird virus, its transmission appears to be increasing at a time, in the northern hemisphere at least, you'd expect influenza viruses to be going away. That's the pattern we have seen with previous pandemic strains."</p>
<p>All experts said the vigilance being shown by the world public-health system is prudent, even if it ends up being an overreaction. It should serve, if nothing else, as a dry run for a more deadly outbreak.</p>
<p>"You have to err on the side of caution, without inflaming people's sense of panic," said Dr. Susan Richardson, head of microbiology at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.</p>
<p>"It's a very useful exercise." Some governments, though, have</p>
<p>gone too far, Dr. Bowie said, pointing to the bans imposed by China, Russia and other countries on pork products from Mexico. "How a hunk of dead meat could spread the virus boggles the mind," he said.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>On guard against swine flu; With a few suspected cases already in the area, officials warn health-care workers and public to take precautions</b>
</div><div>Vik Kirsch   </div>

<div>648 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>Guelph Mercury</div><div>GMER</div><div>Final</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 Guelph Mercury.   </div>
</p>
<p>GUELPH</p>
<p>Wellington-Dufferin-Guelph Public Health is investigating "a few" suspected cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>One person went to a hospital emergency department and several others to their physicians yesterday with respiratory flu-like symptoms, medical officer of health Dr. Nicola Mercer said.</p>
<p>It could take 48 hours to 10 days for all results to come back.</p>
<p>"We have no confirmed cases," Mercer said. She warned, however, that this may not be the case for long. "The picture is changing rapidly."</p>
<p>The health board issued warnings yesterday to local physicians, nurses and other front-line health-care workers to take precautions such as wearing masks and goggles, washing hands regularly with sanitizers, and using disinfectants on medical instruments.</p>
<p>Through an alert to schools, the board also advised people with flu symptoms to wash hands with soap and water, stay home if sick and contact their physicians or go to emergency departments if they feel a pressing need.</p>
<p>The board noted that the first two known cases in the U.S. were children in California.</p>
<p>Mercer is appealing to people visiting hospitals to put on masks and use hand sanitizers available at the hospital and to alert health-care workers of symptoms to minimize the risk of spreading the illness to nurses and others.</p>
<p>People feeling symptoms have been converging on emergency wards.</p>
<p>"I know they are very busy," she said.</p>
<p>Maureen McCafferty, the infection control director at Guelph General Hospital, said a self-screening station has been set up at the entrance to the emergency department.</p>
<p>People with coughs, shortness of breath or fever are asked to "put on a mask right away and report that to a triage nurse."</p>
<p>The nurses assessing patients who walk in the door have also begun wearing masks as a precaution.</p>
<p>Groves Memorial Community Hospital in Fergus was putting up signs asking visitors with flu symptoms to wear masks and report illnesses, chief executive Jerome Quenneville said yesterday.</p>
<p>An outbreak at the Guelph hospital would come at a bad time, with the emergency department still finishing renovations. McCafferty said efforts are nevertheless being made to isolate people suspected of harbouring infection, keeping them at least two metres away from other patients while they're assessed and treated.</p>
<p>Warning signs were being posted yesterday throughout the hospital.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, the hospital was not restricting visitors, McCafferty said.</p>
<p>Infected individuals typically spread flu through airborne droplets that contain the swine influenza virus, whether through sneezing and coughing or by viral deposits on doorknobs and other surfaces.</p>
<p>Though she issued warnings, Mercer did not want to cause a panic.</p>
<p>"The public doesn't need to be overly concerned at this point."</p>
<p>The Hamilton Spectator reported yesterday that health authorities were investigating several suspected cases in people with links to Mexico, an epicentre of the growing swine flu outbreak, with possible links to outbreaks in the United States.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, there were six confirmed cases of the potentially deadly illness in Canada: four in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia.</p>
<p>Swine-flu was reported last week in California and Texas. Cases in Kansas, New York State and Ohio have now been added to the U.S. list, Mercer said.</p>
<p>If the virus continues to spread, Ontario will likely see some cases not connected to Mexico alone, she said, pointing to the separate U.S. outbreaks.</p>
<p>Several antiviral treatments are available, and investigators are trying to determine which is most effective with the new outbreak, the health board reported.</p>

<p>- What is human swine flu?</p>
<p>Swine flu is a strain of the influenza virus that usually only affects pigs, but occasionally infects humans. Symptoms are similar to those of the normal seasonal flu, including fever, fatigue, lack of appetite, coughing and sore throat. Some people with swine flu have also reported vomiting and diarrhea.</p>
<p>- How does it spread?</p>
<p>Health officials are still investigating the nature of the current strain, but they believe it is passing from human to human in the same way the flu normally does, that is when germs enter the lungs through the nose or throat. This can happen when an infected person coughs or sneezes and someone breathes in the particles, or when someone touches a surface with flu particles and then touches their mouth. Eating pork is considered safe, since swine flu doesn't transmit through meat.</p>
<p>- How serious is the outbreak?</p>
<p>It is too early to say if the outbreak will develop into a pandemic, which occurs three or four times a century, spreads quickly among humans and covers a wide geographic area. The World Health Organization currently has a pandemic alert rating of four on a scale of six. The cases in Canada and in the United States have been milder than those reported in Mexico. All the individuals infected in Canada and the U.S. have recovered. The cases in Mexico have been more severe, involving mostly healthy young people who rapidly progressed from mild illness to severe respiratory distress, within an average of five days. Mexico has confirmed 20 deaths but estimates the toll could be higher than 100. There have been no deaths reported elsewhere.</p>
<p>- How can I protect myself?</p>
<p>The Public Health Agency recommends washing hands thoroughly with soap and warm water, or using hand sanitizer. It also suggests staying home if sick, and checking www.fightflu.ca[http://www.fightflu.ca] for alerts and www.voyage.gc.ca[http://www.voyage.gc.ca] for travel advisories. See a doctor if you have severe flu-like symptoms. The agency is not yet recommending that ordinary people wear surgical masks.</p>

</p>
<p>Public health officials are walking a very thin line at the moment, trying to impress on the public the seriousness of taking precautions against the international outbreak of swine flu but at the same time urging people not to panic.</p>
<p>They're hitting the right notes: Generally, to the credit of the profession, public health authorities have reacted in a calm, quick and co-ordinated way, passing information across jurisdictions and borders in a way that has not been seen before.</p>
<p>Scientists and medical professionals are staying ahead of the curve, anticipating rather than just reacting. That's hugely important with a flu virus -- this one is officially known as H1N1 -- that is spreading to every hemisphere, is not fully understood and may be mutating.</p>
<p>This is a new reality: Dangerous viruses spreading at the speed of flight. It's no longer the fiction of Michael Crichton (or Stephen King) but a real-life consequence of a globe-trotting population.</p>
<p>The story of this swine-flu outbreak is evolving even as we go to press. Yesterday, cases of flu related to a serious outbreak in Mexico, had been confirmed in Canada and the U.S. Possible cases -- not yet medically linked -- had been identified in Britain, France, Israel, Spain, Colombia, Brazil and New Zealand.</p>
<p>In Mexico, the toll of believed swine-flu deaths has topped 150 and the government has closed schools across the country. In the U.S., the federal government has issued a travel advisory instructing Americans to avoid non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, scientists and doctors say the makeup of this particular influenza virus is something they haven't seen before. They're trying to determine why it seems to strike young adults more than the usual targets of people with aged or weakened natural resistance, and why its effects on people in Canada and the U.S. are much milder than on people in Mexico. What isn't known is worrisome.</p>
<p>Canadians have every right to be concerned by what they're seeing and hearing: The toll in Mexico, the quick worldwide spread of this virus, the sight of travellers and border officials in Canada wearing masks and public-health warnings of possible severe and even fatal cases of H1N1 in Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>What should be somewhat comforting (too early to be reassuring) is that Canada and other countries have learned from previous outbreaks, perhaps especially the 2003 SARS pandemic that spread to 37 countries and killed 44 people in Canada. Since then, public health officials have refined and practised communications, co-ordinated response, identification and precautions at airports and other international crossing points and fast quarantine and treatment.</p>
<p>For all that, Canadians must prepare to make adjustments -- to travel plans, to possible school closures, to the importance of basic health precautions including handwashing and, yes, wearing a mask.</p>
<p>This isn't the end of the story but the beginning. We'll keep you informed as it develops.</p>

<p>OTTAWA</p>
<p>Immigration Minister Jason Kenney says Canada has tightened the screening process for incoming Mexican workers in an effort to limit the spread of swine flu.</p>
<p>All Mexican workers need to have a fever-check by two doctors, fill out a questionnaire, and undergo a physical before entering the country.</p>
<p>The steps are being taken with thousands of Mexican migrant workers set to arrive on Canadian farms, which rely on foreign help to meet labour shortages during the growing season.</p>

<p>The travel industry is making adjustments in the wake of the human swine flu virus.</p>
<p>In a press conference yesterday afternoon, Federal Minister of Health, Leona Aglukkaq said she wold be issuing a travel advisory for Mexico.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the travel industry is trying to accommodate their customers.</p>
<p>Air Canada is allowing customers travelling to or from Mexico City before May 6 to rebook at a later date without a penalty.</p>
<p>WestJet customers traveling to and from Mexico before May 8 may change or cancel the air portion of their travel arrangements at no charge.</p>
<p>Robert Palmer, manager of public relations for WestJet says customers should contact WestJet directly.</p>
<p>Adida Zdancewicz, media relations for CAA South Central Ontario says other companies are making adjustments as well.</p>
<p>She says travellers who have booked trips to Mexico through <span class="companylink">Sunquest Vacations</span> before May 11, can now reschedule without penalty. They do not have to go to Mexico but they must travel by June 30. They have to pay the difference if the package is more expensive, and they will not get a refund if it's cheaper.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">Air Transat</span> is also allowing customers to make changes without a fee if booked before May 11. They can go to another destination but travel must commence by October 31. People with travel insurance can actually cancel altogether .</p>
<p><span class="companylink">American Airlines</span> is also allowing travellers flying to any city in Mexico to change without a fee. <span class="companylink">VIA Rail Canada</span> has announced they will waive any fees for re-scheduling train reservations due to flight conflicts as a result of the swine flu up until April 30.</p>
<p>While over one million Canadians travel to Mexico annually, travel numbers go down this time of year. Gaudette said if this happened eight weeks ago, it would have been a huge concern for many people.</p>
<p>Anyone with questions should contact their travel agent.</p>

<p>At a glance</p>
<p>Deaths: 149, most of them suspected cases, all in Mexico.</p>
<p>Sickened: 1,995 suspected and confirmed cases in Mexico, and 57 confirmed cases in four other countries -- U.S. (48), Canada (6), Scotland (2), Spain (1).</p>
<p>Threat: World Health Organization raises pandemic alert level to Phase 4 on six-stage threat scale, meaning virus is capable of significant human-to-human transmission. Public health emergency declared in U.S.</p>
<p>Travel: Canada will issue advisory warning citizens against non-essential travel to Mexico. European Union advises against travel to Mexico and parts of U.S.</p>
<p>Canada will issue a warning against non-essential travel to Mexico as swine flu fears dampened stock markets, triggered bans on pork imports in several countries and led to tighter health rules for migrant Mexican workers arriving here.</p>
<p>Canada's tally of confirmed cases of the potentially pandemic flu remained at six, four in Nova Scotia and two in British Columbia. In Ontario, 10 to 12 cases -- one of them in Hamilton -- were under investigation for the new, hybrid influenza strain that has killed up to 150 and sickened nearly 2,000 in Mexico.</p>
<p>As triage workers at St. Joseph's Healthcare donned masks against the possibility of flu transmission from arriving patients, health officials predicted more Canadian cases, and likely deaths.</p>
<p>"In a province this large, where people do have the kind of mobility (they have), it is highly likely that we will see cases in Ontario," said Ontario Health Minister David Caplan. "I think that just given the numbers, it is a likely occurrence."</p>
<p>In Ottawa, Canada's chief public health officer said that while it's true most of North America's current cases have been mild, the severity of a flu can fluctuate.</p>
<p>"In all pandemics, some communities are hit harder," said Dr. David Butler-Jones. "We will likely see more cases. We will likely see more severe illnesses. And we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths."</p>
<p>In the U.S., which has at least 48 cases of confirmed swine flu, the Obama administration said it is now responding aggressively as if the outbreak will become a full blown pandemic. President Barack Obama urged calm.</p>
<p>Rising numbers of cases in Mexico and elsewhere caused the World Health Organization to notch up its global pandemic alert system yesterday, as the virus spread through human-to-human contact in the U.S., Spain and Scotland.</p>
<p>A pandemic -- such as the 1918 Spanish flu which killed tens of millions -- is an outbreak of a new virus that emerges in the human population, causes serious illness, and then spreads easily worldwide.</p>
<p>It has not been determined that the flu originating in Mexico is going to proceed to pandemic levels, but all governments took steps to contain its spread.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said Canada has a six-point plan to deal with the threat, including monitoring cases, international co-operation, research on vaccine development and stockpiles of anti-viral drugs.</p>
<p>"Events are moving rapidly and will continue to evolve hour by hour," she said, promising the government will "do whatever is necessary to protect the health of Canadians and their families."</p>
<p>Travellers returning to Canada from Mexico are now greeted at customs with pamphlets warning about what swine flu symptoms they should be on guard for.</p>
<p>Local doctors, nurses and hospital officials are being asked to keep close track of symptoms that may be signals of the new flu strain among returning travellers.</p>
<p>Dr. Bob Nosal, medical officer of health for Halton, said that for him, and every other health unit in Ontario, "this whole situation is of concern and we obviously have ratcheted up the surveillance."</p>
<p>Complicating diagnosis is the fact that all influenzas have similar symptoms, including fever and cough or shortness of breath. Regular flu is still circulating, for example, Nosal said.</p>
<p>But it is the severity of symptoms, combined with a travel history to Mexico, or contact with others who have been there, which prompts further investigation.</p>
<p>Hamilton health officials said the highest priorities to protect against the flu should be frequent hand washing, proper eating and covering coughs and sneezes.</p>
<p>And, "if you are sick, stay home. That's our number one piece of advice," said Dr. Elizabeth Richardson, chief medical officer of health.</p>
<p>Richardson said swine flu does present like regular flu.</p>
<p>"There isn't anything to date to differentiate it."</p>
<p>She said a team of Canadian doctors have gone to Mexico to try to find out why it is such a severe respiratory disease there.</p>
<p>Lab tests are needed to confirm this swine flu strain, a never before seen amalgam of pig, bird and human viruses. Canada has a stockpile of Tamiflu and Relenza, the two broad spectrum anti-viral drugs this country stores for possible use in a pandemic.</p>

<p>OTTAWA will still allow migrant Mexican workers to come to Canada this year -- including an estimated 90 seasonal workers headed for Portage la Prairie-area farms -- despite worries over a potential swine flu pandemic, federal officials said Monday.</p>
<p>But the government will step up screening of migrants before they arrive, Immigration Minister Jason Kenney said Monday.</p>
<p>All migrant workers will have to fill out a questionnaire and undergo a physical examination and fever check by two doctors before being cleared for departure to Canada. The examinations will occur in Mexico when the workers go to pick up their work permits.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said she directed the Public Health Agency of Canada to send two people to Mexico to help with screening and lab supports. Aglukkaq said the two are already in Mexico.</p>
<p>Seasonal workers from Mexico are critical to portions of Manitoba's agriculture industry. Provincial Agriculture Minister Rosann Wowchuk said about 90 Mexicans worked in the area last year, tending vegetable crops.</p>

<div>THE EXPLAINER: RICHARD BLACKWELL ANSWERS QUESTIONS ON THE FINANCIAL CRISIS</div>

<div id="hd"><b>Tending those ‘green shoots of recovery'</b>

</p>
<p>I keep hearing the optimistic expression “green shoots of recovery” in reference to the first signs of a turnaround in the economy. Where does this come from?</p>
<p>The expression stems from the recession of the early 1990s. Britain's then-chancellor of the exchequer, Norman Lamont, told a Conservative Party convention in October, 1991, that the economic downturn was about to reverse, as “the green shoots of economic spring are appearing once again.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lamont was later mocked by the opposition for those comments because the recovery took a lot longer to get started than he expected.</p>
<p>This time, the expression gained currency after Ben Bernanke, chairman of the U.S. Federal Reserve Board, used it in a March 15 interview on the CBS program 60 Minutes.</p>
<p>“I do see green shoots … not everywhere, but certainly in some of the markets that we've been functioning in,” he said.</p>
<p>What is needed for those green shoots to grow?</p>
<p>In a recent report, <span class="companylink">TD Securities</span> chief economist Eric Lascelles suggested green shoots might have a tough time taking hold. While “this could be the beginning of a delightfully smooth ride home for credit markets and the economy,” he said, there could also be potentially disastrous setbacks involving credit cards, commercial real estate, emerging markets, inflation, or a number of other key issues.</p>
<p>Sometimes setbacks can come out of left field, such as emerging concerns that a swine flu pandemic might dampen a recovery.</p>
<p>Before the green shoots can really become established, Mr. Lascelles said, U.S. house prices have to stop falling, financial firms have to complete their writedowns, credit conditions have to improve significantly and consumer confidence must return. And none of those has happened yet.</p>
<p>What is it then that is making some people optimistic, and propelling recent stock market gains?</p>
<p>So far, most of the positive news reflects economic numbers that are still getting worse, but not as quickly as before.</p>
<p>And some specific leading indicators – such as the stock market – seem to reflect a positive outlook. But most economies around the world are still contracting, even if not as severely as they were.</p>
<p>Economist Robert Kavcic of BMO Nesbitt Burns summed up the view of many, when he suggested that recent earnings reports show “business is still bad, but less bad.”</p>
<p>I was thrilled to see the market recover over the past few weeks. How far are we from making up all the losses since the market topped out?</p>
<p>There is still a very long way to go. The S&P/TSX composite index peaked at about 15,150 last June, and plunged to about 7,480 in March (a drop of more than 50 per cent). It is now up about 26 per cent from the trough, but still more than 5,700 points away from the high.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Pan Am bids delayed</b>

</p>
<p>The outbreak of swine flu in Mexico has infected the sports world.</p>
<p>The delivery of bid books by candidates for the 2015 Pan American Games, which was to take place last Thursday in Mexico, has been postponed by Mario Vasquez Rana, president of the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO).</p>
<p>The delay of the formal presentation of bid plans by Lima, Bogota and Toronto came on the heels of a decision by the continental soccer authority, CONCACAF, to cancel the remaining rounds of its under-17 championship in Tijuana, Mexico, because of concerns about swine flu. A statement from the soccer body said the tournament was abandoned “to safeguard the health of players, officials and fans.”</p>
<p>Officials of the Toronto Pan Am bid were expecting to present one of the books to Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty this week, then jump on a plane to Mexico City.</p>
<p>“We don't have the new date yet, but it's all wrapped up and ready to go,” said David Peterson, chairman of the Toronto-branded bid, which stretches across Southern Ontario and north to cottage country. “Postponing is probably the prudent thing to do.”</p>
<p>The delay in lodging the bid books gives the Toronto bid team a chance to polish its presentation of the athlete village, whose location was revealed on Sunday – the West Don Lands, east of downtown Toronto, on the shore of Lake Ontario. It was the front-running stand-alone site, though bid organizers has explored using dormitory space at York University in Toronto and McMaster University in Hamilton.</p>
<p>The Toronto site, if the 2015 Pan Am Games are awarded to the city, will be the temporary home of about 8,500 athletes. About 2,000 housing units for residents with a mixture of incomes would be the legacy. It is the same location, once called Ataratiri, that was pitched for the village in Toronto's bid for the 2008 Summer Olympics.</p>
<p>“[The Ontario government] acquired that land at a good price when I was premier and now it's undergoing remediation,” Peterson said. “It would have been developed at some time, anyway, but this could speed it up. Waterfront Toronto and everyone else saw its potential … and the voting members [of the 42 Pan American countries] are looking for a plan that will be solid and leave a legacy. They don't want to vote for you and see you change your mind.”</p>
<p>Peterson said the designation of the east-end Toronto site would not encumber Toronto's chances to get the Pan American Games.</p>
<p>“We have train lines right along the lake and there will be dedicated highway lanes,” he said. “Other Games have been more stretched out.”</p>
<p>It's the second delay to hit the Pan Am bidding process. PASO pushed its meeting for the selection of a 2015 host back from August to its meetings in Guadalajara, Mexico, on Oct. 7 to 12. There are reports it could be bumped later still.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Rookie minister praised for quick, open response; SARS experience serves Aglukkaq well</b>

</p>
<p>OTTAWA -- It is the first test for the rookie health minister: a flu, with early cases reported in Canada, that could evolve into the pandemic predicted by medical experts for so many years.</p>
<p>Leona Aglukkaq has been one of the least visible cabinet ministers since her swearing-in last winter. She rarely gives interviews. She has made few national policy announcements. She has seemed content to let other ministers take the limelight.</p>
<p>But the possibility of an influenza outbreak that could claim vast numbers of lives and cause the sort of economic havoc unleashed by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 has thrust her into a leadership role. And even her critics say she is rising to the challenge.</p>
<p>Ms. Aglukkaq is quick to point out, in her soft-spoken fashion, that she really is no neophyte when it comes to health crises. She was, after all, the Health Minister for Nunavut in the aftermath of SARS.</p>
<p>“I was at the territorial-provincial-federal table when we put the pandemic plan together for the country,” she told reporters yesterday. “That plan that we developed in partnership with the provinces and the territories is now in effect and working quite well in my opinion.”</p>
<p>A mother of an eight-month-old son, her staff says Ms. Aglukkaq has been working 14 to 16 hours a day since the swine flu surfaced. “In health there is always at least five to six files going on,” said Tim Vail, her communications director. “But this is obviously dominating.”</p>
<p>And so far, the medical community is responding enthusiastically.</p>
<p>Jan Kasperski, the CEO of the Ontario College of Family Physicians, a group that was highly critical of the federal government's response to the SARS crisis, said the flow of information and the co-operation regarding the swine flu outbreak has been very good to this point.</p>
<p>“My first impression today is that things are working much more quickly and efficiently than we had seen during SARS and that was a great relief to all of us,” Ms. Kasperski said.</p>
<p>Having tackled health issues from both the territorial and federal vantage points. Ms. Aglukkaq said she believes she has a good perspective on the challenges that need to be addressed. And there is no room for partisan bickering, she said.</p>
<p>“In situations like this, it's very important to put aside party politics and be talking with my opposition critics, updating and briefing them on matters of this nature,” the Health Minister said.</p>
<p>Which may be why she was treated so gently at the daily Question Period.</p>
<p>Liberal health critic Carolyn Bennett opened by thanking the minister for calling her on Sunday to keep her apprised of the situation.</p>
<p>It's unprecedented, Dr. Bennett said, that a Health Minister “would call the opposition and ask for advice and make sure that we are all comfortable with the path ahead and allow us to call in to the press conference yesterday.”</p>
<p>Judy Wasylycia-Leis, the NDP health critic who is known as something of an opposition pit bull, was no less effusive in her praise.</p>
<p>“The way in which the virology lab and public health agencies responded so quickly and effectively tells me that we learned a lot from SARS and that they know the most important thing at times like this is to be completely open and public and accountable and transparent,” Ms. Wasylycia-Leis said. “</p>

<div>SWINE FLU: QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>This really has nothing to do with pigs any more; This is a human flu that has mutated from the host species. You can't get it from eating pork. Influenza viruses are not food-borne</b>
</div><div>ANDRÉ PICARD   </div>
<div>747 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A11</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

   </div>
</p>
<p>PUBLIC HEALTH REPORTER</p>
<p>apicard@globeandmail.com</p>
<p>What is swine flu?</p>
<p>Swine influenza is a respiratory disease of pigs caused by type A influenza viruses. Outbreaks of influenza are common in mammals and birds but usually remain contained within their host species. The swine flu that originated in Mexico – swine influenza A (H1N1) – is a genetic mixture of viruses seen in pigs, birds and people. It is being called swine flu because it is structured like a virus that usually infects pigs.</p>
<p>How did the flu go from pigs to humans?</p>
<p>The most likely explanation for the emergence of this new type of flu is humans living in close proximity with pigs. There are occasional reports of humans contracting swine flu but, in this case, the virus appears to have mutated to make it easier to spread in humans.</p>
<p>Can you get swine flu from eating pork?</p>
<p>No. This swine flu is not making pigs sick, it's making humans sick. And, by the way, you won't get the disease from eating fruits and vegetables from Mexico either. Influenza viruses are not food-borne.</p>
<p>I keep kosher – no pork or pork products – so I don't have to worry, right?</p>
<p>Again, this is a human flu; it really has nothing to do with pigs any more. It may be worth noting that Israel's deputy health minister said yesterday that the country would use the term Mexico flu rather than swine flu.</p>
<p>How is the swine flu spread?</p>
<p>Swine flu spreads in the same way as the seasonal flu – through the coughing and sneezing of people with influenza. Infected people can infect others one day before their own symptoms begin and up to a week after becoming sick.</p>
<p>What are the symptoms of swine flu?</p>
<p>Like the seasonal flu, swine flu symptoms can include sudden fever above 38C, dry cough, sore throat, headache and stuffy nose. Swine flu also appears to cause vomiting and diarrhea. In the fatal cases, the virus attacked the lungs, causing severe pneumonia.</p>
<p>Swine flu appears to be deadly in Mexicans yet relatively benign in the Canadians who have been infected. Why?</p>
<p>There is not yet a clear answer to that question but several possibilities. It could be that the virus is mutating and becoming weaker as it spreads. Multiple infections may be a factor: The virus may do more damage in people already fighting off other bacterial or viral invaders. It is also possible that the Mexican population does not have good resistance to this particular virus.</p>
<p>Should I get the flu vaccine?</p>
<p>The seasonal flu shot is unlikely to confer any protection directly against the swine flu. However, public health officials are recommending that, if you haven't had a flu shot, get one. Despite all the media attention on swine flu, the run-of-the-mill seasonal flu is still a much greater threat to your health: Annually, influenza kills about 4,000 Canadians and leads to the hospitalization of another 20,000. So far, six Canadians have been confirmed to have swine flu, and all of the cases have been mild.</p>
<p>Is there going to be vaccine to protect against swine flu?</p>
<p>Scientists in the United States and Canada have already isolated the swine flu virus. They are growing this strain in eggs, which is the first stage of vaccine production. But, using current manufacturing methods, it would take three to six months to produce a vaccine in large quantities.</p>
<p>The Spanish flu killed between 20 and 100 million people worldwide in 1918-19. Isn't it the same as swine flu – type A influenza H1N1?</p>
<p>Influenza viruses are classified by two proteins on their surface: H for hemagglutinin and N for neuraminidase. The Spanish flu and the Mexican swine flu are both the H1N1 subtype but they still have many genetic differences. Spanish flu originated in birds and Mexican swine flu in pigs. The Spanish flu had unusually severe symptoms, notably causing massive bleeding, both internal and external. There is no indication swine flu causes similar symptoms. Also, social conditions and medical knowledge today are not what they were a century ago.</p>

<div>FLU OUTBREAK</div>
<div>National News</div>
<div id="hd"><b>WHO raises alert level as virus spreads its reach; Move to phase 4 signals sustained human transmission</b>
</div><div>CAROLINE ALPHONSO AND GLORIA GALLOWAY   </div>
<div>The Globe and Mail; Canadian Press</div>
<div>1094 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>A1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>TORONTO and OTTAWA -- The spread of the swine flu virus across continents can no longer be stopped, and countries should instead look to mitigate its impact, the World Health Organization said as it raised the pandemic alert level for the first time yesterday.</p>
<p>The new H1N1 flu strain has moved rapidly from its epicentre in Mexico, prompting governments to advise against travel to the country. Canada plans to issue an advisory warning against non-essential travel to Mexico.</p>
<p>“There is no region to which this virus could not spread,” said Keiji Fukuda, the WHO's acting assistant director-general for health security and environment.</p>
<p>“Given the rapidly evolving situation, it was important to send a strong signal to countries that now is a good time to strengthen preparation for possible pandemic influenza if it continues to evolve in that direction.”</p>
<p>The fast-changing profile of this new virus pushed the WHO to move up its emergency committee meeting to yesterday. Officials promptly raised the alert level from 3 to 4 in its six-rung ladder for the first time since the system was devised four years ago. Level 4 means there is human-to-human transmission of the virus sufficient to sustain community-level outbreaks. Level 6 is a full-blown pandemic.</p>
<p>“The move from phase 3 to phase 4 signifies that we have taken a significant step closer [to a pandemic]. But we are not there yet and the situation could change,” Dr. Fukuda told reporters in a call from Geneva.</p>
<p>The key to mitigating the spread of the disease is the development of a vaccine, which Canada has already begun.</p>
<p>Other key options involve advising citizens to stay home if sick, wash their hands and, at their most severe, close schools, restrict public gatherings and limit travel. The WHO was against closing borders and restricting travel, saying such measures would not stop the spread of the virus and would cause economic harm.</p>
<p>Even so, the United States, India and Malaysia issued advisories about travelling to Mexico.</p>
<p>The European Union advised against non-essential travel to Mexico and parts of the United States. Canada was mentioned.</p>
<p>The virus first came to light on April 17, and has since hopped from continent to continent, infecting people in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Spain and Scotland. Officials expect it will be found elsewhere soon. The virus is suspected in as many as 149 deaths in Mexico. Canada has six confirmed cases in British Columbia and Nova Scotia, the United States 40, Spain one, and two in Britain. Outside of Mexico, where nearly 2,000 people are believed to be infected, all patients are recovering or have since recovered.</p>
<p>Doctors do not know why the cases outside Mexico have not been as serious. Frank Plummer, the Scientific Director General of the National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, said it could be a function of the environment, and the strain that moved here could be slightly different.</p>
<p>Still, Canada's Chief Public Health Officer David Butler-Jones warned that the future course of the virus in Canada is unpredictable.</p>
<p>“Simply because we are seeing mild symptoms so far does not mean we can take this for granted,” Dr. Butler-Jones said. “We will likely see more cases, we will likely see more severe illnesses. And we will likely, unfortunately, see some deaths as well. We hope not but that is a normal part of an influenza outbreak of any type.”</p>
<p>The new strain appears vulnerable to anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza if it is caught in its early stages. A number of countries were already planning for a pandemic, triggered by the avian flu in southeast Asia, and have started the process of creating a new vaccine for swine flu. The WHO said a vaccine could take as many as six months to develop.</p>
<p>Dr. Plummer said Canada has initiated discussions with manufacturers. “We are confident that we will be able to get to the point where we have a vaccine seed stock within a few weeks,” he said. It would be some time after that before the vaccine would be available to the general public.</p>
<p>In Ontario, David Williams, the province's acting chief medical officer of health, said there are sufficient stockpiles to treat 25 per cent of the province's population with a full course of anti-viral drugs. There are 10 to 12 suspected swine flu cases in Ontario.</p>
<p>Federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said the government is taking a continentwide approach in dealing with the virus and making decisions in concert with the United States and Mexico.</p>
<p>As of yesterday, all travellers to and from Mexico were given notices alerting them to the symptoms. The Mexican seasonal worker program is to go ahead, but those workers will be subject to a pre-departure medical exam.</p>
<p>“I think Canadians agree that we need to take every precaution possible,” Ms. Aglukkaq said. “I don't take these decisions lightly but I would rather be too cautious during a time like this than not cautious enough.”</p>
<p>****</p>
<p>WHO uses a six-phase series of alerts to inform the world of the seriousness of the threat.</p>
<p><pre>INTER-PANDEMIC PHASE New virus in animals, no human cases Low risk of human cases                             1

<p>The schools in Mexico are closed, the churches are warning parishioners to stay away, the streets of Mexico City are as empty as the Saskatchewan plain. Yet Canada, as of late yesterday afternoon, was agonizing over whether to warn travellers against non-essential visits to the epicentre of a swine-flu outbreak. Pardon us, but the wisdom of Solomon is not really needed here. Just do it.</p>
<p>Even assuming that Ottawa went ahead and issued the warning last night, the lethargy among decision-makers speaks poorly of Canada's ability to stay on top of an emerging health threat. Playing catch-up is the wrong way to fight a public-health emergency, as Canadians know from the SARS epidemic of 2003.</p>
<p>Canada has been awfully ready to declare how much it learned from SARS, but some complacency has been noticeable in the federal response to the swine-flu outbreak. It is not reassuring to learn that it will be an unspecified number of days before Ottawa distributes “information sheets” about the swine flu at airports. How long does it take the government of Canada to publish an information sheet?</p>
<p>Although there are some reasons for optimism – the six confirmed cases of swine flu in Canada have produced mild symptoms only – there are also big reasons for concern. For one, it is young people between 25 and 44 who are dying in Mexico, and in fast-growing numbers. That is different from, say, SARS, which was most dangerous to the elderly and those with weak immune systems. For another, Mexico is the second-most popular destination among Canadian travellers, after the U.S. In 2007, Canadians made more than one million visits to Mexico. Mexicans made 230,000 visits here. And up to 20,000 Mexican workers are on their way to Canada for the summer farming season. If someone sneezes in Mexico, Canadians will catch the germs.</p>
<p>Canada may worry that travel warnings will rebound and hurt tourism here. In 2003, the World Health Organization issued a travel advisory that affected this country. Yesterday, the WHO opted to recommend against travel warnings, saying countries should focus not on containment but on reducing the impact of the flu. This is baffling. Both the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the European Union's Health Commissioner warned against non-essential travel.</p>
<p>Much remains to be learned about the virulence of the swine flu, and how fast the disease spreads. But the WHO raised its alert level to 4, on a scale in which 6 signifies a global pandemic. They did so partly on Canada's advice. Then why was Canada tied in knots about issuing a travel advisory? David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said yesterday there are economic costs to telling people to stay home, and these must be considered. (Canadians spent $1-billion in Mexico in 2007.) This, too, was not reassuring. There are gargantuan costs, economic and otherwise, to a pandemic.</p>
<p>Caution does not mean panic. Whether Canada has learned the lessons of SARS remains to be seen.</p>

<div>Globe Life</div>
<div id="hd"><b>How to prepare for a pandemic</b>
</div><div>MARINA JIMÉNEZ   </div>
<div>1054 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>The Globe and Mail</div><div>GLOB</div><div>L1</div><div>English</div><div>2009 CTVglobemedia Publishing Inc. All Rights Reserved.

</p>
<p>The World Health Organization hasn't yet declared swine flu a global pandemic – but already news of the unusual bug that began in Mexico is leaving people panicked and uncertain.</p>
<p>There is still much that experts don't understand about the epidemiology of the outbreak.</p>
<p>They cannot say why those infected in Mexico, where the outbreak is known as la gripe porcina, are between the ages of 20 and 50 – not a population normally vulnerable to flu. Infectious disease specialists also don't yet know why the six confirmed cases in Canada and the 40 in the United States appear to be more mild.</p>
<p>“This flu has never before been seen in pigs or humans, which means we don't know its capabilities,” said Donald Low, medical director of Ontario's public health laboratories and chief microbiologist at Toronto's Mount Sinai Hospital. “We are seeing this flu in its very early stages and we must continue to monitor it. We don't have the epidemiology to define whether it's seasonal flu or more like the flu of 1968, where one in every 100 people died.”</p>
<p>Still, there are specific measures people can take to avoid getting flu and to prepare for the possibility of a pandemic.</p>
<p>People should use “common sense,” Dr. Low cautions, and not overreact. Swine flu is not transmitted through fruits and vegetables from Mexico, and you cannot get the virus from ingesting pork products.</p>
<p>Among the best protection against flu of any kind is frequent handwashing.</p>
<p>Also important is good coughing and sneezing etiquette (into your sleeve) and avoiding contact with people who are experiencing flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>Flu viruses are normally transmitted through uncovered coughs and sneezes from a distance of up to one metre, and are spread by touching your mouth or nose with unwashed hands. As well, flu viruses can live on surfaces, such as a doorknob, for several hours.</p>
<p>Dr. Low said there is no reason to run out and buy a face mask unless you are caring for someone who has the flu. “You would be better off to buy an alcohol-based hand wash and carry it with you,” he said.</p>
<p>Two antiviral medications, Relenza and Tamiflu, are effective in fighting this strain, known as influenza A H1N1 virus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. These medications can block the virus's ability to replicate in the body and must be taken within the first few days that symptoms appear.</p>
<p>But does this mean you should run out and fill a prescription for Tamiflu?</p>
<p>“At this point, augmenting individual stockpiles is not all that useful as a national plan to combat a possible pandemic,” advises Geoff Taylor, director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>Without professional guidance, people may not use the antiviral medications in the right dosage or for the specified length of time, which could lead to drug resistance or unnecessary side affects.</p>
<p>As well, the federal and provincial governments have stockpiled 55 million doses and outlined “priority” groups in the case of a pandemic, including those at a high risk of dying from the illness and essential service and health care workers. Individual hospitals and institutions across the country also have supplies, added Dr. Taylor, who until recently sat on the committee that developed the Public Health Agency's pandemic influenza plan.</p>
<p>Experts don't yet know why the virus has only killed people in Mexico. It is possible those people already had other infections, or were hospitalized after the virus became more virulent. Epidemiologists are on alert to see if the flu virus spreads to people who have not been to Mexico, which would escalate the risk substantially. Yesterday, the WHO raised its pandemic alert level from 3 to 4, saying the virus is now widespread and being transmitted in a sustained way between people.</p>
<p>In their 2006 book, The Flu Pandemic and You: A Canadian Guide, authors Vincent Lam and Colin Lee advise how to prepare for and live through a flu pandemic.</p>
<p>They recommend maintaining a “social distance” of one metre to decrease your risk of spreading or contracting flu, and to avoid greetings that involve direct physical contact such as handshakes and a peck on the cheek. They also advise you not to share food, cigarettes or water bottles and to follow all public health measures, such as warnings not to go to school or daycare, or other isolation and quarantine measures.</p>
<p>Gloves should not be used as a personal protective measure in routine daily life, according to Dr. Lam, an emergency room physician and the 2006 Giller Prize winner for his first work of fiction, and his co-author. They say masks are only necessary if you are in close contact with an infected person and they should not be reused or shared.</p>
<p>Other precautions worth considering in case of a pandemic:</p>
<p>• Get a bicycle (automobiles keep you from interacting closely with people, but there is the potential problem of fuel shortages).</p>
<p>• Set up online banking and shopping services.</p>
<p>• Keep a supply of cash at home.</p>
<p>• Look into the possibility of working at home.</p>
<p>• If there are ill and non-ill people in the same house, set up a zone for the sick and have a threshold area between the two where the ill people can leave things for the non-ill and vice versa.</p>
<p>• Have a month's supply of food in your home (non-perishables) as well as a can opener and a first aid kit.</p>
<p>• Buy a small, self-contained water purification system and/or stockpile bottled water (even though Canada has safe, drinkable tap water, occasional dysfunction in water treatment systems can occur and you cannot go a day without clean water).</p>
<p>• Keep batteries, flashlight, candles and matches in the extreme case of disruptions in power supplies.</p>
<p>• If you are taking prescription medication, have an extra month's supply.</p>
<p>• Stock up on contraceptives, pain killers, multivitamins and oral rehydration fluids.</p>
<p>“Choosing how to go about your daily life during a pandemic means striking a balance between an activity's risk of exposing you to influenza and whether that activity is essential for you,” the authors write.</p>

<p>MANITOBA hog producers are ramping up safeguards to protect against swine flu since scientific experts still can't pinpoint whether the virus originated in pigs or humans.</p>
<p>Hog barn workers with flu-like symptoms are being told to see a doctor and stay home, while hog producers on are the lookout for any signs of sickness among their herds.</p>
<p>Manitoba's chief veterinarian Dr. Wayne Lees called pigs a "mixing vessel" for flu, since the animal has receptors in its trachea for bird flu and human flu, along with a susceptibility to swine flu. Lees said human flu prefers human hosts, bird flu prefers birds and swine flu normally likes pigs -- but he warned viruses can mutate quickly and jump from species to species.</p>
<p>While the disease is currently spreading from person to person, Lees said there is a concern the virus could crop up in pigs.</p>
<p>A small number of Manitoba pigs fall ill with flu every year, and exhibit symptoms similar to humans, including runny noses.</p>
<p>Reports out of Mexico allege that one of the first victims of the virus lived near pigs, and no health officials have been to the man's home yet to inquire about the hogs or offer his antiviral drugs to his close contacts.</p>
<p>There are no cases of swine flu in Manitoba, but hospitals across the province are on high alert for patients with symptoms consistent with the new disease.</p>
<p>"If a pig is co-infected with influenza viruses from a person and is already incubating a swine virus, that sets up opportunities for these recombinations to happen and that's why it's so unpredictable," said Lees.</p>
<p>Manitoba Pork Council general manager Andrew Dickson said hog barn workers already shower before and after entering a barn so as not to bring diseases like influenza to work. Hog operations restrict the flow of people and animals inside barns to prevent the spread of illnesses, and pigs coming into Manitoba from the U.S. are quarantined and inspected for signs of disease.</p>
<p>"We've advised producers that they should keep an eye on their herds and in particular their employees, because it would appear this flu has got the wrong name," Dickson said.</p>
<p>He said it's more likely people will infect pigs than vice versa.</p>
<p>The origin of swine flu is one of the many unknowns as the mysterious disease continues to raise global fear that it could unleash the next pandemic.</p>
<p>"Simply because we are seeing mild symptoms so far does not mean we can take this for granted," said Canada's chief public health officer Dr. David Butler-Jones. "We will likely see more cases. We will likely see more severe illnesses. And we will unfortunately likely see some deaths as well. We hope not, but that is a normal part of an influenza outbreak of any type."</p>
<p>A number of different scientific teams at the Winnipeg-based National Microbiology Lab are working to develop a swine flu vaccine, along with a full genetic profile of the virus from Mexico.</p>
<p>Manitoba's chief medical officer Dr. Joel Kettner said the province has stockpiled about 200,000 doses of antivirals should a pandemic strike.</p>

<p>MEXICO'S swine flu, regarded as potential pandemic, began emerging in March but only now has riveted the attention of world health officials. These things -- SARS, bird flu and now swine flu -- befuddle experts as they grapple with the unknown, while launching measures to protect citizens. There were no cases identified in Manitoba as of Monday, but authorities expect that will change.</p>
<p>Manitobans, like citizens everywhere, are anxious for news on how to avoid the infection that has nearly closed down Mexico City. Without good information about the characteristics of H1N1 -- the number of cases compared to the number of deaths -- good advice comes down to the standard line of defence: Wash your hands often, smother the sneezes and, if sick, stay home.</p>
<p>Questions persist about when Mexico raised the alarm, about how it is responding even now. It asked only recently for help identifying the virus that had caused a spike in flu cases in mid-March, after insisting for weeks there was nothing unusual about the flu season. Last week, when H1N1 was found in the United States, Mexico warned Canada about a respiratory illness that seemed to have a high fatality rate. On Sunday, a Mexican woman learned from a reporter her husband, who died April 20, succumbed to swine flu. Health officials had not conducted any investigation at her home despite the fact their neighbours keep pigs in their backyards.</p>
<p>There has been an uneven response to H1N1. Some countries adopted strict measures to test travellers from countries where cases have been confirmed. Some of the responses Canada discarded in the wake of its SARS experience as ineffective are being used elsewhere. (Canada found that most people don't fit properly fit their face masks and so they are not recommended for use in the general public and the use of thermal sensors to detect fever among returning travellers failed to make an impact during the SARS outbreak.)</p>
<p>A modern pandemic can arise by stealth and move with a rapidity that makes the spread of the 1918 Spanish flu look plodding. The world's best defence is the fact news also travels fast, drawing global health organizations into the detection game. Like SARS, this swine flu is making ordinary people more aware of the threat and, therefore, better able to protect themselves. Ultimately, a wary, informed public is the best defence for a pandemic widely expected to come soon.</p>

<p>Director, McLaughlin-Rotman</p>
<p>Centre for Global Health,</p>
<p>University Health Network</p>
<p>and University of Toronto</p>
<p>Classrooms in Mexico are empty and public gatherings have been cancelled as that country reels from its epidemic of swine flu. The handful of cases seen so far in the United States and Canada, by contrast, have been relatively mild: The 2003 SARS epidemic killed at least 774 people worldwide, including 44 in Canada, the 1968 Hong Kong flu killed about a million people and the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic killed as many as 50 million.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization declared yesterday that “the likelihood of a pandemic has increased” and raised its alert level to match. Even if the Mexican outbreak becomes a pandemic – meaning that it spreads easily between humans and affects a wide geographic area – a pandemic can be mild. But at the moment, there are mixed messages – serious and fatal cases in Mexico and mild cases elsewhere. It's prudent to go on high alert and to prepare for any eventuality.</p>
<p>Canada learned hard lessons from the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003. Tragic though it was, SARS made Canada better prepared for swine flu. One of its lessons is that leadership matters. After SARS, the federal government created the Public Health Agency of Canada and the position of chief public health officer.</p>
<p>In a pandemic, it's important to have a national public health expert in charge, working in close co-operation with provincial public health leaders. The public needs a trusted voice as a source of information and guidance, because individual actions, such as staying home when sick, are critical to controlling any outbreak. Also, global threats like a pandemic need a co-ordinated international response and someone to speak authoritatively for Canada.</p>
<p>SARS stimulated the development, adoption, and updating of pandemic plans in health-care institutions, businesses and non-profit organizations such as schools and places of worship. A hospital pandemic plan might speak to screening procedures for visitors, guidelines for transferring patients into and out of the facility, and the stockpiling of masks, gowns and anti-viral drugs. There is also a national stockpile with more than 55 million doses of anti-viral drugs.</p>
<p>The adoption of pandemic plans by thousands of organizations across the country also makes us better prepared. During SARS, the ethical challenges came fast and furious. Should public health authorities identify the person later found to be infected who took mass transit? How should intensive-care beds and anti-viral drugs be allocated? What is the duty of health-care workers, from doctors to librarians, to come to work and take on personal risk? We saw stories of personal courage and sacrifice and learned to value the efforts of front-line health workers, especially nurses. The ethical questions admit no easy answers, but they are now addressed in many pandemic plans.</p>
<p>Another SARS lesson is that science matters in a public health epidemic. With record speed, the genome of the SARS virus was sequenced in a Canadian lab, and diagnostic tests and vaccines were developed. Public health laboratories in Winnipeg have already played a role in helping to diagnose Mexican virus samples, and have begun work to develop a vaccine, although this might take six months.</p>
<p>We learned that preparedness depends not only on government, but on citizens. The Public Health Agency of Canada has urged us to wash our hands thoroughly, to cough and sneeze in our sleeves, to stay home when sick. Simple measures and common sense can make a big difference. A key lesson from SARS is that preparedness includes us.</p>
<p>In coming days, it will become clearer whether this outbreak is the world's next severe pandemic. Canada is better prepared as a result of the tragic dress rehearsal of SARS. Even if we are ready for opening night, the response to a severe pandemic is a difficult production to stage.</p>

<p>It's easy to see why U.S. consumer confidence is at a record low, but it is less clear as to why it is expected to bounce higher today.</p>
<p>The U.S. Conference Board's consumer confidence index is forecast to have increased to 30 in April from 26 in March, according to a survey of economists by Bloomberg.</p>
<p>The expected pickup in confidence today would come even as U.S. house prices, which many consider to be at the crux of the U.S. financial crisis and a key destroyer of confidence, continue to decline.</p>
<p>What are the expectations?</p>
<p>The S&P/Case-Shiller Home Price Index, which is scheduled for release today, is forecast to have declined 2.5 per cent in February from the previous month.</p>
<p>There could be a “meaningless” upward creep in consumer confidence, but confidence remains mired at deep recessionary levels, said Avery Shenfeld, chief economist with <span class="companylink">CIBC World Markets Inc</span>.</p>
<p>“Modest movements in consumer confidence don't translate into spending decisions,” he cautioned.</p>
<p>Some say consumer confidence is being bolstered by the stock market rally. Even with the swine flu scare that yesterday sent the U.S. dollar and bond prices soaring on a flight to safety, the S&P 500 index showed only a modest selloff.</p>
<p>How will the market react?</p>
<p>“It does seem like that market can shake off dire economic news these days,” said Douglas Porter, deputy chief economist with <span class="companylink">BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc</span>. “That has to be seen as moderately positive.”</p>
<p>Before the market opened yesterday, the futures indicated a serious selloff, but stock markets came back, said Tony Genua, portfolio manager of AGF American Growth Class Fund. “Investors know we are in an economic valley and are willing to look beyond it,” Mr. Genua said. “It will take four to six months for confidence to return,” he said.</p>
<p>And companies that should do well in an economic upturn, such as <span class="companylink">Amazon.com Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Apple Inc</span>., <span class="companylink">Corning Inc</span>. and <span class="companylink">Qualcomm Inc</span>., are showing improvement even in a tough economy, Mr. Genua said.</p>
<p>Not even dismal economic projections being made by U.S. government officials and economic agencies are shaking investor confidence.</p>
<p>“While these official projections now look quite reasonable, one can't help but wonder if this late conversion to deep pessimism isn't another sign that a bottom has finally been reached,” BMO's Mr. Porter said.</p>

<p>What makes outbreaks like swine flu so frightening are all the unknowns. How many people will it kill? Will health authorities be able to contain the virus before it gets out of control? How long before it runs its course?</p>
<p>Reading the headlines, it's easy to freak yourself out. But for all the unanswered questions about the virus itself, based on previous health scares including SARS, there are a couple of things we can say with a fair degree of certainty:</p>
<p>1) Any setback to the stock market will be temporary.</p>
<p>2) If you sell out of fear, you'll regret it.</p>
<p>Even before reports of Mexican swine flu emerged, the stock market was looking for an excuse to give back some of the gains it's been racking up. While yesterday's 1.6-per-cent drop on the S&P/TSX hardly qualifies as a panic selloff, if the slide continues, investors sitting on cash may be able to turn the outbreak to their advantage, money managers say.</p>
<p>“I would use a good selloff as a buying opportunity,” says Tony Demarin, president of BCV Asset Management in Winnipeg. “You definitely don't sell.”</p>
<p>Dumping your stocks at the height of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) scare certainly would have been a mistake. As the accompanying charts shows, stocks plunged from mid-January to mid-March that year as the number of probable SARS cases rose. But as the number of cases peaked, stocks started roaring back.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that the stock market didn't wait for public health officials to issue an all-clear; it started rising well before then.</p>
<p>“Even though the [World Health Organization] only lifted the SARS alert in the summer of 2003, the market began to rally at around the time the number of probable cases began to fade,” says Stéfane Marion, chief economist and strategist at National Bank Financial.</p>
<p>That said, Mr. Marion cautions that it's impossible to predict whether the swine flu outbreak will be more or less severe than SARS. Adding to the risks, the global economy is in a more precarious state today than it was in 2003, which makes it more vulnerable to a setback.</p>
<p>Some investors are fearing the worst, judging by the plunge in shares of airlines, cruise operators and hotels yesterday – companies that will be the first to feel the impact of a slump in travel.</p>
<p>Still, even in more severe health crises, the stock market has shown remarkable resilience. During the Spanish flu pandemic of 1918 to 1920, in which up to 100 million people died, the Dow Jones industrial average gained 83 per cent from its 1917 low to its late-1919 high, said John Johnston, chief strategist for Harbour Group at <span class="companylink">RBC Dominion Securities</span> in Toronto.</p>
<p>The behaviour of stocks during both severe and mild outbreaks “tells you that any hit to the economy and any hit to the stock market is temporary in nature,” he says. “My view is that the economy will hit bottom in November, and I think there's a chance now that [because of the swine flu outbreak] that it could be later, but I'm not inclined to change my forecast.”</p>
<p>The good news is that, although the disease has been linked to more than 100 deaths in Mexico, elsewhere the cases have been much milder. What's more, because of SARS and the threat of avian flu, public health authorities are in a position to respond quickly to the current outbreak by administering anti-viral medications and ordering vaccines.</p>
<p>This health crisis will pass. Don't let it scare you into doing something you'll regret.</p>

<p>INVESTMENT REPORTER</p>
<p>What a difference a week makes.</p>
<p>Last Monday, North American markets swooned after <span class="companylink">Bank of America</span> warned it would set aside billions of dollars more than expected to cover rapidly escalating losses from bad loans.</p>
<p>Yesterday, investors were given another opportunity to wreak havoc on recent gains, after world health officials warned about the possibility of a global flu pandemic.</p>
<p>But they managed to concentrate their selling on stocks most likely to suffer a near-term drop – airlines and hotels. Air Canada and <span class="companylink">WestJet Airlines Ltd</span>. fell 6 and 5 per cent, respectively, but the contained losses to travel-related stocks suggests some sort of normalcy is returning to key indexes such as the S&P 500, analysts said.</p>
<p>“This is a much calmer market than we've become use to,” said Vincent Delisle, equity strategist at Scotia Capital. “If this had happened in November or even February, it would have added fuel to the speculation that this was 1932 all over again.”</p>
<p>After morning stock futures pointed to a harsh drop at the open for U.S. equities, both the S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average rallied to post morning gains. While the advances proved unsustainable – the Dow fell 0.64 per cent and the S&P 500 was down 1.01 per cent – they proved far less calamitous than some had expected at the beginning of the day.</p>
<p>In Toronto, the S&P/TSX composite posted a 1.62-per-cent loss, as energy shares fell 2.39 per cent on fears that global travel would slow as a result of the outbreak of swine flu. Oil closed down $1.41 (U.S.) to $50.14 on the <span class="companylink">New York Mercantile Exchange</span>.</p>
<p>While American airlines were hit hard – the Amex airline index fell 10.62 per cent – Canadian carriers Air Canada and WestJet held up better.. Cameron Doerksen, an analyst at Versant Partners, said they would have taken a bigger hit if the outbreak came during the winter vacation season.</p>
<p>“That's the one piece of sort-of-good news, because the peak is basically at an end and the airlines are shifting the bulk of their capacity to other routes,” he said. “There will be an impact to some extent, but it would be much worse if it was in the peak season.”</p>
<p>And while several countries, including India and Malaysia, have warned their citizens to avoid travelling to North America, David Baskin said the hit on airline stocks is likely to be a short-term phenomenon.</p>
<p>“After 9/11, investors acted as if nobody would ever fly on a plane again and I think the same thing happened [yesterday],” said Mr. Baskin, president of Baskin Financial Services in Toronto. “People are selling, preparing for the worst, and when the worst doesn't happen they'll buy back. I have no idea what will happen with the outbreak, but it does appear at this point that global officials have it under control.”</p>
<p>Pharmaceutical and biotech companies saw their shares spike, with <span class="companylink">Roche Holding AG</span> and <span class="companylink">GlaxoSmithKline PLC</span> gaining 4 and 6 per cent respectively, as investors anticipated the companies ramping up production of their drugs Tamiflu and Relenza, which seem to be effective in combatting flu.</p>
<p>“Perhaps things will get worse as the week unfolds, however, I see a trough forming,” said Sheryl Purdy, vice-president of <span class="companylink">Leede Financial Markets Inc</span>. in Calgary. “We continue to have events unfold that if we were digesting them during the fall of 2008 might have had deeper percentage declines.</p>
<p>“We see a blip downwards, and then we seem to rally back to neutral.”</p>

</p>
<p>canadian banks, airlines, telephone, internet companies and other large or government-regulated firms are all closely monitoring the swine flu outbreak for signs it could turn into a full-fledged pandemic.</p>
<p>For now, they're advising employees to be cautious: Reconsider your travel plans, wash your hands, cover your sneeze with your sleeve.</p>
<p>But if public health agencies, such as the World Health Organization, upgrade the outbreak to a pandemic it would trigger a whole range of corporate contingency plans, emergency preparedness experts explained yesterday.</p>
<p>Those plans can include everything from stockpiling antiviral drugs for key employees to creating backup sites for key processes, such as stock trading, and determining who can work from home if the subway system is shut down.</p>
<p>"In a true pandemic, it's projected to affect 30 to 35 per cent of the population, who would either be sick, or looking after someone who's sick, or there could be transit shutdowns, so people would have difficulty getting to work," said David Howell, a principal in The Pandemic 101 Corp., an emergency preparedness consultancy based in Mississauga.</p>
<p>So far, emergency experts said, there is no cause for alarm.</p>
<p>At this point, the swine flu has been classified a "phase 4" outbreak by WHO, well below the level that could trigger government restrictions on travel and trade that would affect business, Howell said.</p>
<p>For now, employers say they are trying to help staff understand how to minimize their risk of contracting swine flu.</p>
<p>"We have sent a communication to employees advising them of the Flu and its symptoms, and suggesting that if they have these symptoms and have recently travelled to Mexico to visit a medical professional," Rogers Communications Inc. vice-president Jan Innes wrote in an email yesterday. "We have reminded staff ... to wash hands, cough into their arm, etc."</p>
<p>TD Bank Financial Group was advising employees to stay home if they have flu symptoms and avoid contact with others. The bank also suggested employees check with their doctor before travelling to Mexico, where there have been some 2,000 suspected cases and about 150 deaths. The swine flu outbreak was a major topic of conversation at the emergency preparedness conference on Vancouver Island yesterday. Several participants who work for public health agencies had to leave early to return to work, said Brian Miller, president of the Ottawa consulting firm Vanguard EMC Inc., and former risk manager with Bell Canada. Reached in B.C., he said, "There's no need for anybody to overreact until we get more information."</p>
<p>Some employers pay drug makers an annual fee to stockpile antivirals, noted Ralph Dunham, president of Marsh Canada, a risk consulting business.</p>
<p>Roche Canada, maker of the antiviral tamiflu, said yesterday it has had more calls than usual about it but is processing orders as usual.</p>

</p>
<p>WASHINGTON -- When the sneezing fit began, the crowd parted quickly. Nobody was taking chances yesterday at the Baltimore airport.</p>
<p>The furtive glances of those scooching clear of the offending nose - a father pulling his young son to the side, others glancing back nervously as they quickened their pace - offered clues.</p>
<p>Maryland is not yet on the swine flu list. Nor has sneezing been identified as a symptom of the feared outbreak. But for one fleeting minute, a mood of better safe than sorry was evident among the travellers passing through Baltimore. And when the sniffly woman recovered, she too fled quickly, bringing the episode to an end.</p>
<p>U.S. authorities are jittery, too. But on a day that saw a doubling to 40 of confirmed swine flu cases throughout the States, they worked hard to quell anxieties with abundant reminders that not one has yet proved fatal. Not for Americans, at least.</p>
<p>"In the U.S., you want to focus on the fact that no one has had serious illness from this," said Laurie Garrett, a Pulitzer Prize-winning infectious disease expert with the Council on Foreign Relations.</p>
<p>The U.S. infections include one major cluster of students and family members associated with St. Francis Preparatory School in Queens, adding up to 28 confirmed cases and another 17 probable ones.</p>
<p>Despite the rising numbers, many Mexicans coming into the United States yesterday at one of the busiest border crossings shunned advice to wear surgical face masks to curb the spread of the deadly flu.</p>
<p>Most Mexican immigration officials at the Tijuana-San Diego crossing were using masks and surgical gloves, but Mexicans crossing by car and foot seemed unconcerned by the influenza scare and only a handful wore masks.</p>
<p>The disease has hit hardest in the capital, but life was disrupted from Tijuana to Acapulco, a lucrative Pacific resort town where night clubs and bars were ordered closed until further notice.</p>
<p>With the people of Mexico City already rattled by the flu, a strong earthquake struck yesterday, swaying tall buildings and sending office workers into the streets.</p>
<p>The quake had a magnitude of 5.6 and was centred near Chilpancingo, about 210 kilometres from Mexico City and 80 kilometres from Acapulco. There were no reports of damage anywhere in the country.</p>

<div id="hd"><b>Common drugs can kill bug: MDs; Widespread mortality unlikely here as disease would be caught early</b>
</div><div>Joseph Hall   </div>

<div>449 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>The disease may be the same but Canadians likely have a more robust immunity to the swine flu that has killed almost 150 people in Mexico, health officials say.</p>
<p>The ailment appears to be eminently treatable if caught early, which is more likely to happen here with our ready access to care and vigilant public health system, says a top Canadian microbiologist.</p>
<p>Bhagirath Singh, head of infectious disease with the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, said early treatment of the flu with common antiviral drugs appears to provide an effective antidote.</p>
<p>With public health agencies poised to pounce on and treat any suspected cases, he said, Canadians may not have to worry about it causing widespread mortality here.</p>
<p>At least six Canadians have been diagnosed with the flu: four from Nova Scotia on a school trip to the Yucatan, and two separate cases in B.C. All have recovered after being treated with antiviral drugs.</p>
<p>While Singh stressed it is too early to know what has caused the mortality difference between Canada and Mexico, he said earlier access to treatment is a likely explanation.</p>
<p>The disease combines portions of four different influenza strains in ways never seen before, experts say.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it appears to be readily controlled by the two common influenza drugs, Tamiflu and Relenza, said Dr. Susy Hota, an infection control specialist at Toronto's University Health Network</p>
<p>Other infectious disease experts pose different theories for the apparent mortality discrepancies between Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Dr. Mark Loeb of McMaster University said Mexico may simply have experienced far more flu cases, prompting more deaths. "Right now there aren't enough cases in Canada for us to assess what the severity is going to be."</p>
<p>Experts also speculate that many of the Mexicans who died from the flu may have had underlying disease or respiratory problems - such as tuberculosis - that would not be nearly as prevalent here.</p>
<p>For most people, the illness would be survivable, Hota said.</p>
<p>Singh, however, noted that many of the Mexican dead appeared to be healthy and relatively young so their demise would instead have been caused by an overwhelming immune response. "You produce a super response and that super response is really what leads to the complication of the disease."</p>
<p>Loeb, Singh and Hota, however, said it's also possible the Mexican strain is simply a more virulent form of one seen in Canada so far.</p>

</p>
<p>Newcastle slipped a step closer to relegation from the Premier League yesterday with a 0-0 draw against visiting Portsmouth.</p>
<p>Newcastle fielded Michael Owen, Mark Viduka and Obafemi Martins in a three-man attack but all three missed chances and the Magpies remained in the three-team relegation zone, winless in four games under new manager Alan Shearer.</p>
<p>Portsmouth, now almost safe from relegation, came closest to scoring when it hit the post through Richard Hughes in the 82nd.</p>
<p>The result left Newcastle with only a win over last-place West Bromwich Albion in its last 15 Premier League matches.</p>
<p>Reading kept its hopes of promotion to the Premier League from the second-tier League Championship alive with a 2-0 win at relegation-threatened Norwich.</p>
<p>TOURNEY CANCELLED: The remainder of the world under-17 championship in Mexico has been called off because of concerns about swine flu.</p>
<p>CONCACAF, which oversees soccer in North and Central America and the Caribbean, also will delay the second leg of its Champions League final between CD SC Cruz Azul and Atlante FC, both Mexican clubs, for two weeks, until May 12.</p>
<p>Costa Rica, Honduras, Mexico and the United States had clinched spots in tomorrow's scheduled semifinals of the U-17 tournament, which was being played in Tijuana.</p>
<p>Canada was eliminated from the tournament over the weekend and travelled to San Diego by bus Sunday morning.</p>
<p>After the Mexican government announced it was closing schools nationwide, CONCACAF decided to abandon the tournament "to safeguard the health of players, officials and fans."</p>
<p>KLINSMANN FIRED: Bayern Munich dismissed coach Juergen Klinsmann yesterday after only 10 months in one of the most closely scrutinized jobs in German soccer.</p>
<p>The defending champions dismissed Klinsmann, 44, two days after the club lost at home to Schalke 1-0 in the latest of a string of disappointing results. Bayern is now third in the Bundesliga.</p>
<p>"This was a very difficult decision for us," Bayern chairman Karl-Heinz Rummenigge said. "But the results of the past few weeks, the way in which they came about and, above all, the situation five games before the end of the season, forced us to act out of responsibility to the club."</p>
<p>Bayern said Jupp Heynckes will take over until the end of the season.</p>
<p>KNEE SURGERY: Everton defender Phil Jagielka will have surgery tomorrow to repair a ruptured knee ligament, ruling him out of the FA Cup final.

<p>NASCAR won't change surface at Talladega</p>
<p>Despite injuries to fans from flying debris, NASCAR is satisfied with its safety standards, saying the fence at Talladega Superspeedway did what it was supposed to do - keep Carl Edwards' car out of the grandstands.</p>
<p>In a spectacular last-lap accident, Edwards' car sailed upside-down into the front-stretch fence, which bowed but held, before the battered vehicle returned to the track. Blake Bobbitt, one of seven injured by debris, remained hospitalized yesterday with a broken jaw.</p>

</p>
<p>As Ontario investigates 10 to 12 potential cases of swine flu, the world is steps away from declaring the illness a global pandemic.</p>
<p>The World Health Organization yesterday moved the global pandemic alert level to four out of six as the novel strain of swine flu proves to spread readily from person to person. Mexico, where 149 have died, faces a public health crisis and the streets of Mexico City, home to more than 20 million, are empty.</p>
<p>Thousands more around the world are ill. Scotland, Canada, the United States and Spain are now reporting cases of swine flu.</p>
<p>More than one million Canadians visit Mexico each year, mostly in the winter. Roughly 19,000 people travel between Canada and Mexico during an average week in April, said Kamran Khan, an infectious disease specialist at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.</p>
<p>SARS-experienced Ontario has operated at a level four pandemic alert since the weekend, holding regular high-level briefings with updates sent to all hospitals and care providers. Ontario has stockpiled enough antiviral medication to treat 25 per cent of the population. Drugs such as Tamiflu and Relenza have shown some effectiveness against swine flu.</p>
<p>While six cases have been reported in Nova Scotia and B.C., Ontario has not had one positive lab test result among the 50 done.</p>
<p>Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said there were no new confirmed cases nationally yesterday, but added it was not time to relax. "We will likely see more severe illnesses and we will likely unfortunately see some deaths as well. We hope not, but that is a normal part of an influenza outbreak of any type."</p>
<p>In British Columbia, health officials said a "handful" of suspected cases are being monitored while the two confirmed ones have shown no signs of spreading.</p>
<p>Dr. David Williams, Ontario's acting chief medical officer of health, said he expects to soon see mild to moderate cases in this province.</p>
<p>. "With the province being the size it is, with the amount of travel back and forth to Mexico, I would anticipate we'll have some of those cases similar to the United States."</p>
<p>Of the 10 to 12 potential cases being probed, some patients are in isolation in hospital. Some have recovered and have been sent home. The test result turnaround time for swine flu after a swab is four to five days, Williams said. By the end of this week, Ontario's public lab will have the technology needed for quicker test results. British Columbia has faster results because it was doing research on the test, according to the Ontario health ministry.</p>
<p>Ontario has a strong public health system in place after SARS and the public should have confidence the system is working as it should, said Health Minister David Caplan.</p>
<p>The Ontario and global situation is fluid and changing rapidly, said Dr. Donald Low, medical director of the Ontario Public Health Laboratories. "We have a number of suspect cases we are investigating."</p>
<p>Health professionals and the public should not be "lulled into a false sense of security" that this is a mild disease because healthy, young people in Canada and the United States seem to recover, said Low, who was one of the top provincial players in the 2003 SARS outbreak.</p>
<p>The danger is if the flu mutates and how it responds in the elderly, the very young and people who have other health problems. The virus may have first hit the Southern Hemisphere hardest since regions below the equator are entering both winter and the flu season, said Dr. Michael Gardam of the Ontario Agency for Health Protection and Promotion. In the Northern Hemisphere, the virus may "die out" as flu season winds down but it could re-emerge in the fall.</p>
<p>"I can guarantee the virus we are dealing with now is not the same one we were dealing with a month-and a half ago," he said. "Flu viruses change constantly. It will become more adapted to spread in humans just from natural selection."</p>

</div><div>350 words</div><div>28 April 2009</div><div>The Toronto Star</div><div>TOR</div><div>ONT</div><div>A13</div><div>English</div><div>Copyright (c) 2009 The Toronto Star   </div>
</p>
<p>Q: What is swine flu?</p>
<p>A: Pigs spread their own strains of influenza and every so often people catch one, usually after contact with the animals. This new strain is a mix of pig viruses with some human and bird viruses. Unlike more typical swine flu, it is spreading person-to-person.</p>
<p>A 1976 outbreak of another unusual swine flu at Fort Dix, N.J., prompted a problematic mass vaccination campaign, but that time the flu fizzled out.</p>
<p>Q: How easy is it to catch this virus?</p>
<p>A: Scientists don't yet know if it takes fairly close or prolonged contact with someone who's sick, or if it's more easily spread. But in general, flu viruses are spread through uncovered coughs and sneezes, or by touching your mouth or nose with unwashed hands.</p>
<p>Flu viruses can live on surfaces for several hours, like a doorknob just touched by someone who sneezed into his hand.</p>
<p>Q: In Mexico, officials are handing out face masks. Do I need one?</p>
<p>A: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control says there's not good evidence that masks really help outside of health-care settings. It's safer just to avoid close contact with someone who's sick and avoid crowded gatherings in places where swine flu is known to be spreading. But if you can't do that, CDC guidelines say it's OK to consider a mask - just don't let it substitute for good precautions.</p>
<p>Q: Is there anything that helps patients with swine flu get better?</p>
<p>A: The virus is vulnerable to the anti-viral drugs Tamiflu and Relenza.</p>
<p>Q: Why aren't airports around the world installing heat-detecting sensors?</p>
<p>A: Because, unlike SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome), which was highly contagious at the fever stage, swine flu spreads early, even before the contagious individual knows they are unwell. The difference renders heat-detectors moot as the damage is already done.</p>
<p>The SARS outbreak killed more than 900 people worldwide in 2003.</p>

</p>
<p>Q: Can I travel to Mexico?</p>
<p>A: The Canadian government has not issued an official warning against visiting the country but is offering information on protecting oneself from the flu.</p>
<p>"These (measures) include washing your hands often, covering coughs and sneezes, and staying home when ill."</p>
<p>Q: What can I do to prevent myself from getting the flu?</p>
<p>A: Wash your hands and cough in your sleeve. "If you don't have access to soap and water, use an alcohol gel," advises Dr. Richard Besser, of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Q: What should I do if I've been in an area with swine flu, and now have coughs, aches and fatigue?</p>
<p>A: Call your doctor or Telehealth Ontario at 1-866-797-0000 to speak to a nurse.</p>
<p>Q: Should I just show up at a clinic or doctor's office?</p>
<p>A: "Notify them in advance as a courtesy to the physician ... so they can take proper precautions to protect themselves and their patients," says Dr. Danuta Skowronski, a physician epidemiologist with the B.C. Centre for Disease Control.</p>
<p>Q: Is it safe to eat fruits and vegetables from Mexico?</p>
<p>A: Yes.</p>
<p>"The virus is not found in food and it's not transmitted by ingestion of food," says Dr. Andrew Simor, infectious disease specialist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre. "In terms of influenza viruses and swine flu, it is 100 per cent safe."</p>
<p>Q: Can you get this swine flu from handling or eating pork products?</p>
<p>A: No. "It is perfectly safe to eat pork because that's not a means of getting swine flu," Simor says.</p>
<p>Q: Should I get a seasonal flu shot, and if so why?</p>
<p>A: The seasonal flu shot will not protect against swine flu.</p>
<p>Q: Where can I go for more information?</p>
<p>A: The Public Health Agency of Canada at 1-800-454-8302 or www.phac-aspc.gc.ca[http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca.login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca].</p>

</p>
<p>Mexico city -- An area dotted with pig farms in the Gulf of Mexico coastal state of Veracruz is suspected as ground zero in the outbreak of swine flu that is spreading across the globe.</p>
<p>Mexican Health Secretary Jose Angel Cordova said yesterday tests show a 4-year-old boy contracted swine flu in the state at least two weeks before the government confirmed the first death.</p>
<p>The boy's case was part of a wider outbreak of a normal strain of influenza in early April, Cordova said. But after officials knew of the swine flu strain, the boy, who survived, tested positive for the new strain. It is unclear if his case spawned the epidemic.</p>
<p>The outbreak in Veracruz occurred near a farm run by Granjas Carroll de Mexico, which is partly owned by Virginia-based <span class="companylink">Smithfield Foods</span>. A company statement said it "has found no clinical signs or symptoms of the presence of swine influenza in the company's swine herd or its employees at its joint ventures in Mexico."</p>
<p>The mayor of Perote told the Los Angeles Times about 800 people became ill around March 20. Twenty-five people with more serious cases were later tested, and only the boy tested positive for swine flu.</p>
<p>Health officials have confirmed that the first death from swine flu occurred April 13, when a 39-year-old woman died in the state of Oaxaca, south of Mexico City.</p>

<p>Dylan Pazzano is afraid swine flu will prevent his dying wife from seeing their 5-year-old son one last time.</p>
<p>And to make matters worse, he said, she doesn't even have the illness.</p>
<p>"It's gone beyond frustration into absolute rage. I've been treated better by the people of Mexico than I have been by my own country," Pazzano told the Star from the intensive care unit of Hospiten Cancun in Mexico.</p>
<p>"I am, in all honesty, disgusted to be called a Canadian citizen right now."</p>
<p>Victoria George-Pazzano, a market researcher from Toronto, has been in hospital on life support since suffering a severe asthma attack at a resort outside Cancun last Tuesday morning, said Pazzano. And despite the best efforts of her insurance company and loved ones to bring the 29-year-old woman home, that's where she remains.</p>
<p>"There appears to be a block, and we strongly feel that it's related to the outbreak (of swine flu), and through association they don't want to bring her home," said Pauline George, Victoria's mother, from her home in Pickering.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the World Health Organization raised its global alert level on the spreading swine flu virus to four out of six, stopping short of declaring the world's first flu pandemic in more than 40 years.</p>
<p>The suspected number of deaths rose to 149 in Mexico, the epicentre of the outbreak with nearly 2,000 people believed to be infected. The U.S. has diagnosed 40 cases, Canada six, Spain one and Scotland two. Only Mexico has seen severe disease caused by the virus.</p>
<p>George-Pazzano lives with Pazzano and their young son near Pape and Danforth Aves.</p>
<p>"We want to have any time that she has left. Whether it be only one hour, we want her home," said George.</p>
<p>Pazzano said Victoria's travel insurance provider, RBC, had no trouble finding an air ambulance. But finding a bed in an intensive care unit - any intensive care unit - in the GTA has proven more difficult.</p>
<p>The hospitals, they have been told, are full.</p>
<p>Not so, according to Ontario Health Minister David Caplan.</p>
<p>"There is ICU capacity," he told reporters, noting that the health system here should "be able to provide the care that Ontarians expect."</p>
<p>A ministry spokesperson said no orders have been issued to restrict the admission of people from Mexico into Ontario's hospitals.</p>
<p>"We're more than ready, and have been since 2003 with SARS," said Andrew Morrison.</p>
<p>An RBC spokesperson confirmed the company was handling the case, but declined to comment further, citing privacy rules.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, federal Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq said the Canadian government is doing its best to bring George-Pazzano home.</p>
<p>Her husband is not convinced.</p>
<p>"If they were working closely they would have had us back home already," he said.</p>
<p>There might not be much time left. Pazzano said his wife's condition is worsening. Her attack was too severe, he said, and struck too far from hospital.</p>
<p>All he wants now is to bring her home so their son, who left Cancun a few days ago after being picked up by George-Pazzano's sister, can see his mother one last time.</p>
<p>"I've made sure that he's shielded from the truth until I can get home and explain to him what has happened to mommy."</p>

<p>Larry Hardison had just bought a new house - the lawn wasn't even in yet - and was setting down roots in his mid-western U.S. town when he felt a bit of a tightening in his chest one day.</p>
<p>There were aches and pains and a fever. Nausea, too. Finally, he had to stay home from work.</p>
<p>"I was flat on my back for the better part of a week," Hardison recalls.</p>
<p>It was the fall of 1976 and the disease he had was swine flu.</p>
<p>A mini-epidemic earlier that year in New Jersey had health officials across the U.S. on edge. Today, the disease is back, with its centre this time in Mexico.</p>
<p>"I really sat up and took notice when I heard that," says Hardison, a 64-year-old retired phone company worker in Concordia, Mo., about 100 kilometres east of Kansas City.</p>
<p>Convinced at the time he had nothing more than a bad case of the flu - and not the worst he'd ever had, either - Hardison saw his doctor after a few days, anxious to get back on the job.</p>
<p>The doctor did all the usual tests but also took blood to get tested before sending Hardison home with little more than over-the-counter cough medicine.</p>
<p>It was odd, Hardison remembers, but certainly not the last odd thing to happen.</p>
<p>A few days later, a couple of "government doctors" showed up at his door, asking questions.</p>
<p>A friendly man, Hardison went along; he gave his answers and said his goodbyes.</p>
<p>Then he glanced out the front window.</p>
<p>"I look out and these two fellows are taking samples of dirt from the lawn," he recalls. "I didn't know what they were up to."</p>
<p>Shortly after, Hardison was back at work when his wife got a call from the family doctor.</p>
<p>The diagnosis was in: swine flu, the same strain that had killed one and infected about a dozen others at Fort Dix, N.J., the previous winter.</p>
<p>The Fort Dix cases became international news and spurred then-U.S. president Gerald Ford to begin a national flu vaccination program, which Jimmy Carter continued.</p>
<p>The origins of the Fort Dix outbreak were never determined, so when Hardison's case popped up months later, the whole country noticed.</p>
<p>"I went to work the next day and there were reporters there from The New York Times and a couple of TV camera crews," Hardison says, surprise still in his voice 33 years later.</p>
<p>He talked to them for as long as he could but the disruption forced his boss to finally send him home for the day. "We weren't getting any work done," Hardison says.</p>
<p>The government doctors returned, too, with the Centers for Disease Control setting up shop at the newly built Concordia City Hall to test anyone Hardison had been in contact with and to figure out where he had contracted the disease.</p>
<p>That was also sort of odd, Hardison says. "They were there checking me out and I'm in there setting up their phones."</p>
<p>About 200 guests from a wedding Hardison had attended around that time had to be tested - "That put a bit of a strain on things," he remembers. Also, someone from the CDC spilled blood on the new carpet at city hall.</p>
<p>Still, no one else in the town of about 2,000 was ever found to have the disease.</p>
<p>Because Hardison's work stringing telephone lines took him out to rural areas, several local farms and their pigs were also tested.</p>
<p>Nothing.</p>
<p>In fact, just like Fort Dix, no cause was ever found for Hardison's illness.</p>
<p>His swine flu sort of cured itself without doctors doing anything more than treating his symptoms.</p>
<p>Eventually, the reporters and the CDC went home. All that was left behind was the blood stain, a lot of questions and a pile of newspaper clippings that Hardison says he'll keep in a scrapbook for his grandchildren.</p>
<p>He's still amused by some of the headlines. "I've got one from New York City that says I died," he says, laughing.</p>
<p>Once he was feeling better, Hardison says he got his first flu shot. "I've had one every year since."</p>

<p>Stock markets closed lower yesterday amid worries that a swine flu outbreak might snowball into a full-blown pandemic that could derail the economic recovery.</p>
<p>"Caution, I think, is probably the right word," said Fred Ketchen, manager of equity trading at Scotia Capital.</p>
<p>"But you would have expected that, given what we've seen in other parts of the world, and they're all concerned of course about this virus."</p>
<p>Health stocks were a bright spot, and <span class="companylink">General Motors Corp</span>. shares surged as well, as the release of the automaker's restructuring plans raised hopes that GM may avoid bankruptcy.</p>
<p>Toronto's S&P/TSX snapped a four-session winning streak, closing 154.68 points lower at 9,394.8, from a stressed energy sector and falling crude prices.</p>
<p>The <span class="companylink">TSX Venture Exchange</span> moved 3.83 points lower to 1,002.98, while the Canadian dollar was down 0.67 of a U.S. cent to 82 cents.</p>
<p>New York's Dow Jones industrial average fell 51.29 points to 8,025, as GM said it will cut 21,000 U.S. factory jobs phase out its Pontiac brand and ask the government to take company stock in exchange for half GM's government debt by next year.</p>
<p>The struggling automaker, facing a June 1 deadline to restructure, also said it will offer 225 shares of common stock for every $1,000 in notes held by bondholders, as part of a debt-for-equity swap.</p>
<p><span class="companylink">General Motors Canada</span> will slash its workforce by more than half to 4,400 by 2014 and close as many as 310 dealerships by the end of next year.</p>
<p>GM shares ran ahead 35 cents, or 20.7 per cent, to $2.04 on Wall Street.</p>
<p>The Nasdaq composite index slipped by 14.88 points to 1,679.41 while the S&P 500 index dropped 8.72 points to 857.51.</p>
<p>The flu is not yet a global pandemic - the World Health Organization is operating at level three, with level six signalling a full pandemic.</p>
<p>There have been 149 deaths, all in Mexico, 20 of which have been confirmed as swine flu and the rest suspected. There have also been confirmed cases in the United States, Canada and Spain.</p>
<p>The virus is striking at a vulnerable time for the stock market and the economy.</p>
<p>Indexes in Toronto and New York have jumped more than 20 per cent from lows in early March, and investors are swimming in a deluge of mixed earnings reports.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, investors are waiting for the results of the stress tests the U.S. government is giving the country's 19 largest banks.</p>
<p>Regulators briefed bank officials on Friday about the tests, which will determine which banks may need further help from the government, but the results will not be publicly released until May 4.</p>

<p>It is understandable that concerns are rising over the spread of deadly swine flu - a virus suspected in illnesses around the world, including half a dozen confirmed cases in Canada. But health officials are surely right in advocating prudence rather than panic.</p>
<p>"We remain vigilant," Dr. David Butler-Jones, Canada's chief public health officer, said yesterday. "While the risk to most Canadians remains low, we all need to practise basic flu prevention techniques (such as frequent hand-washing) all the time."</p>
<p>Here in Toronto, epicentre of Canada's 2003 SARS outbreak, we certainly know the cost of failing to respond quickly and effectively to public health threats. The price was paid in lives (44 Canadians died in the SARS outbreak) and in the economy (as tourism slumped badly). But Canada is now better prepared to handle an infectious agent like the new H1N1 swine flu strain spreading outward from Mexico.</p>
<p>Since the SARS outbreak, hospitals have drafted pandemic plans and increased the number of isolation rooms and "negative pressure" rooms that are able to contain a virus. There's also better collaboration between various health agencies, more lab capacity, and stockpiles of anti-viral drugs. All that should serve us well.</p>
<p>Still, our health-care network is far from perfect, and there is concern that budget pressures, including layoffs in some Ontario hospitals, have weakened its ability to handle an epidemic's surging demands.</p>
<p>The situation is especially troubling in Mexico, where more than a hundred people have died. Fortunately, the cases confirmed in Canada have generally been mild. And while it is almost certain that more Canadian cases will emerge in the coming days and there may even be some deaths, it is worth noting that even conventional strains of influenza kill about 4,000 Canadians each year.</p>
<p>This is not to minimize the potential damage that could be wrought by swine flu. Since it involves a new strain of influenza virus, it is impossible to say precisely how this outbreak will evolve. One thing is certain: it isn't standing still - not geographically, as people move from one country to another, and not genetically, because flu viruses rapidly mutate and can develop highly dangerous variants.</p>
<p>Taken as a whole, a solid case can be made for remaining calm but not complacent. Through their words and actions, Canada's public health officials appear to be maintaining that balance. That should get us through this crisis with maximum protection and a minimum of fear.</p>

<p>Health authorities around the world are taking steps to stop the spread of the outbreak of swine flu in Mexico, which has now spread to confirmed cases in Canada and the U.S.</p>
<p>The swine influenza outbreak should be processed with factual information, measured preventive action and prudent preparations in case of its spread.</p>
<p>The influenza virus comes in A, B, and C types and has infected virtually every warm-blooded animal on Earth. Each carries its own form of flu; swine flu typically sickens pigs, not humans.</p>
<p>However, animals often exchange viruses with other animals and, for instance, pigs can catch both human and avian flu. When flu viruses from different species infest an animal, mixed viruses can emerge, due to the "re-assortment" of H and N antigens.</p>
<p>The new swine flu virus may contain the most resistant portions of both and, if well-adapted, the virus can spread quickly and efficiently from human to human.</p>
<p>A pandemic results, which is the present concern of the public health community.</p>
<p>There is no vaccine to protect against the currently circulating H1N1 swine flu strain.</p>
<p>Scientists are working overtime to formulate one, but the task is daunting since flu viruses can change quickly.</p>
<p>Also, symptoms of swine flu in people are relatively similar to those of seasonal influenza. Therefore the true extent of the outbreak is uncertain.</p>
<p>Fortunately, people can't catch swine flu from eating pork, assuming standard cooking temperature of 160F is used, which kill all bacteria and viruses.</p>
<p>What can we do?</p>
<p>Normal hygiene practices [like hand-washing] are crucial.</p>
<p>This is also an opportune time to consider personal and family preparation in case of an epidemic or pandemic. Consider, "What do I need in order to cope for up to two weeks if stores, schools, and businesses close?"</p>
<p>Public activity has been shut down in Mexico City for 10 days and this might be extended.</p>
<p>The physical, economic and social loss to a city of 22 million is enormous, but even more so will be the national cost of an outbreak in Canada, much less worldwide.</p>
<p>Therefore we must each do our part to stay informed, guard against infection and be pandemic-prepared.</p>
